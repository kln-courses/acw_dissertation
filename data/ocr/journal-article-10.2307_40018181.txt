Within those traditions, it is generally recognized that the universe has its own order and history that are independent of human will. A moral discourse has to find space to accommodate human agency in the midst of the iron grid of cosmic law. Both Confucius and Aurelius use the concept of timeliness (kairos) to resolve the difficult issue. But their philosophies take on diver- gent paths. By studying their resolutions of the issue, we will be able to appreciate the distinctive nature of their nontheistic moral narratives. key WORDS: Aurelius, Confucius, kairos, time, stoicism, Horace, justice, cosmic law, seminal reason, change 1. Man in the World In the philosophies of Confucius and Aurelius, we find a typical conun- drum within nontheistic traditions that concerns the relation between man and his position in the world. There is a well-known paradox in Confucius's reformist agenda: he knows that the historical era to which he belongs would reject his reform, but he refuses to forgo his effort. His perseverance is not explained by the obstinate character that is usu- ally associated with people who refuse to accept their defeat. Confucius knows that he is to be disappointed in the end, and holds a low opinion of anyone who is stubborn and inflexible. For Confucius, the matter has rather to do with his personal destiny and the Mandate of Heaven. How- ever, the puzzle remains. Since Confucius emphasizes more than once that a man of virtue (jun zi) should understand his time and adapt his actions to it, how could he explain his untimely struggle?

Â© 2006 Journal of Religious Ethics, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">116 Journal of Religious Ethics The problem in Aurelius is set in a different context. Aurelius states that the meaning of life is only to be found in the moment we live in, and has nothing to do with its durational value in history. Consistent with his Stoic conviction, Aurelius stresses that man ought to be self- reliant and not care for anything beyond the cultivation of his current well-being. However, Aurelius adds that the significance of an individual consists only in the fact that he is a part of the larger whole: a part of the universal substance and an infinitesimal section of the universal time. Every man ought to have a historical awareness and the consciousness of being a citizen of the world (which he calls the virtue oikoinonia). The strain between the two virtues, self-reliance and koinonia (fellowship to others), is obvious: if every man is self-reliant, what good is fraternal fellowship? Despite the difference of their language, Confucius and Aurelius are faced with the same general problem, which has to do with the moral status of human agency vis-a-vis cosmic and historical order. Generally speaking, the tension can be nonexclusively manifested in three aspects. (1) While the daily pressures of life can be exhausting, it can occur to a person that he is really struggling for nothing since, compared to his- tory, a person's life is short, fragile, and lacks meaning. This nihilistic trivialization at the historical level of a person's intellectual and emo- tional labor in life explains one of the Stoic maxims that a person should be detached from worldly affairs. (2) Being a social creature, a person often experiences a conflict between his individualism and historicism. His desire for individuality can clash with the collective demand of world history. History in general is a niggardly stepmother who deems ev- erything insignificant. The strain between Aurelius's cosmic awareness (that each individual is insignificant compared to the universe) and his Stoic tendency to elevate man's spirit to a divine status is really a spe- cial case of this conflict. (3) There is often an antinomy between per- sonal ideals and historical reality. This usually represents an intellectual discomfort - one feels that he is let down by reality or that he does not identify with the historical period in which he lives. This is a sentiment of profound disappointment, reflecting a misfit on both sides. It often re- sults in a mutual rejection between the person and his time. Confucius's dilemma lies more or less in this. 2. Timeliness and Resolutions The banality of the sentiment, which is associated with the famil- iar sense of human mortality, implies that, for any of its possible resolutions, there probably would not be much that is philosophically remarkable. This is true to a large degree. Most people take two common resolutions that are prereflective and nonphilosophical, ultimately</page><page sequence="3">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 117 amounting to what existentialists call acts of "bad faith": they either pretend that the historical moral significance of a man is strictly an intellectual issue and lead a life as if death were never theirs, or they try to accumulate as much power and wealth as possible, as if through do- ing so, they could turn the world into their personal possession. The two resolutions do not in any real sense resolve the original tension because, while the act of pretension evades the issue, the one who grabs power in the hope of conquering history is clearly delusional. Even some of the philosophical resolutions seem too radical to be practically plausible or intellectually interesting. Absolute nihilism ex- aggerates the historical negligibility of things and regards life itself as a mere shadow. This otherworldly perspective naturally leads to a complete withdrawal from life and a philosophy of quietism. Hedonism shares this nihilistic premise, but arrives at an opposite conclusion: if nothing mat- ters beyond one's death, the only legitimate purpose of life ought to be the enjoyment of pleasures. Equally extreme is another doctrine that gives no meaning to individual life and evaluates everything from the grand scale of historical evolution. Men are mere tools of history - history is the sole standard of truth. This doctrine often finds itself a convenient bed- fellow of political despotism and lends justification to its utter disregard of human life. In comparison with those prereflective or philosophically radical res- olutions, the approaches of Confucius and Aurelius are interesting be- cause of a shared feature in their philosophies: they try to find a balance in the relation between man and the world. They do not automatically deny man's historical relevance or accept absolute nihilism. Between his- tory and man, they wish to establish a position that recognizes history's dominance over individual persons as well as the unique dignity of a hu- man being. Both of their approaches point to a single important concept that makes the two vastly different philosophers comparable for the sake of this paper: the concept of timeliness. While the Greeks call it "kairos" the Chinese call it "shi" Just as the idea of kairos plays an important role in Greek culture, shi is arguably one of the most important concepts in the Book ofYi Jing (a book that has a tremendous influence over the de- velopment of Confucianism and Daoism alike) and figures prominently in the thought of Confucius. It is no wonder that both Confucius and Aurelius find the concept of timeliness useful, given the distinctive advantage it has over con- cepts such as "time" and others. The difference between time and time- liness lies in this. While time (in the non-Kantian, mundane sense of the word) is restricted to a dimension of objective reality, timeliness in- volves man. In fact, it allows man to take a center stage in his relation to history. In considering what counts as a timely action, a person not only needs to register the trend of historical evolution, but also has to</page><page sequence="4">118 Journal of Religious Ethics evaluate his personal ideal in relation to his capability. Timeliness, by its definition, suggests a harmonious cooperation between a person and history at large. 3. Aurelius's Reductive Ethics: The Meaning of Life One of the fundamental attitudes of Stoicism is its indifference to what is uncontrollable. This includes things such as personal fortune, disease, other people's opinion, mortality, and many others. Since freedom and independence form the backbone of the Stoic spirit, Stoicism refuses to grant any positive moral value to things that might even be beneficial (such as a good natural endowment), as long as they are not in the control of man.1 A Stoic person must be a person of autarkeia (self-reliance) and eleuthenia (being in control). Aurelius inherits this Stoic conviction from his predecessors, such as Epictetus and Seneca, but applies it to his study of time and reaches a distinctive conclusion with regard to the meaning of life.2 First, Aurelius states that since men can do nothing about events that belong to the past or future, the historical meaning of life should be of no concern for us. His indifference toward history comes close to being nihilistic: [C]ontemplate all the records of past time and of entire nations, and see how many after all their high-strung efforts sank down so soon in death and were resolved into the elements [Aurelius 1999, 4.32]. Ephemeral all of them, the rememberer as well as the remembered! [1999, 4.35]. Cease not to bear in mind how many physicians are dead after puckering up their brows so often over their patients; and how many astrologers after making a great parade of predicting the death of others; and how many philosophers after endless disquisitions on death and immortality; and how many cities are, if I may use the expression, dead [1999, 4.48]. 1 Epictetus teaches that whatever lies beyond my control is morally indifferent (adi- aphoros) and does not concern us (Epictetus 1979, BK I, XXIX, 6-15, BK II, VI, 1-27). Seneca writes, "A bad man makes everything bad, but the upright and honest man cor- rects the wrongs of Fortune" (Seneca 1918, XCVIII, 119). Although torture is not desirable, it cannot by itself be bad. A good man can endure it and conduct himself therein with bravery, honor, and courage (Seneca 1918, LXVII, 37). * Eleutheros is the single most important virtue for Epictetus (Epictetus 1979, BK 1, 12, 2-12 and passim), while Seneca stresses the quality of self-mastery that is derived from the greatness of soul (animi magnitudo). To be in control is so important for Seneca that he deems a scornful attitude (contemptio) toward Fortune fundamental to a person's internal well-being: "it is worthwhile to be outdone by all men, provided that I myself can outdo Fortune" (Seneca 1918, LXVIII, 51). He believes that an independent man should refuse to be grieved by even the loss of his own children (LXXTV, 133).</page><page sequence="5">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 119 Second, on account of the fact that man can influence and control the present, Aurelius identifies life with living - life is the current moment a man lives in. Since life, in his eyes, is not identified with a stretch over any period of time, Aurelius would not hesitate to say that Methuselah's life is not a bit longer than that of anyone else: Even if thy life is to last three thousand years or for the matter of that thirty thousand, yet bear in mind that no one ever parts with any other life than the one he is now living, nor lives any other than that which he now parts with. The longest life, then, and the shortest amount but to the same. For the present time is of equal duration for all, while that which we lose is not ours [1999, 2.14]. Third, the logical conclusion is, given the moral irrelevance of the his- torical duration of life, the meaning of self-cultivation lies in the cultiva- tion of the present. Aurelius's position is best captured in these words, the words of Seneca: [W]hat is the chief thing in virtue? It is the quality of not needing a single day beyond the present, and of not reckoning up the days that are ours; in the slightest possible moment of time virtue completes an eternity of good (in quantulo libet tempore bona aeterna consummai) [Seneca 1918, XCII, 463; my emphasis]. Just like this, Aurelius reduces his moral discourse to the investigation of the significance of the present life. It is at this place that Aurelius's Stoic orientation comes to its crux, for he must specify, in unambigu- ous words, his Stoic understanding of the present moment in order to distinguish himself from positions such as hedonism and absolute ni- hilism. Here, Aurelius does exactly that. According to him, the virtue of the present life lies solely in man's right reasoning (eulogistia) and jus- tice (dike): "To sum up, life is short. Make profit of the present by right reasoning and justice. In thy relaxation be sober" (Aurelius 1999, 4.26). 4. A Mirror in Horace The translatability of the descriptive statement "life is short" to the en- dorsement of justice, rationality, and sobriety constitutes a crucial piece of Aurelius's ethics. Without this translatability, the sober awareness of the brevity of life can easily lead to non-Stoic ideas. This is exactly what happens in the case of Horace. Since all we have is the current moment and nothing matters beyond what we feel here and now, Horace teaches: "carpe diem," let's pour down wine and put "biting cares to flight" (Horace 1997, 34, 41). Although Horace's Epicureanism tends to accord with Stoicism on many issues, his Bacchic spiritualism is still a half world separated from Aurelius's implicit teetotalism. Let me digress for a</page><page sequence="6">120 Journal of Religious Ethics discussion of Horace in order to explain the problem that Aurelius is faced with.3 Generally speaking, the philosophical affinity between Horace and Aurelius is striking. Horace agrees with Aurelius on each of the following four points: 1. That things do not abide in time: Horace is aware of the fragility of existence. In his Ode 1.5, his emphatic use of the word semper (always) illustrates the delusional mind of a young lover who is not aware of the prospect that the face of his beloved will be soon like "seas roughened by black winds": [B]ut now in all innocence he enjoys your golden beauty and imagines you always available (semper vacuam), always lovable (semper amabilem), not knowing about the treacherous breezes - I pity poor devils who have no experience of you [Horace 1997, 30; 1926, 18]. Like Aurelius, Horace sees death as inevitable (Ode 2.14): Ah how quickly, the years glide by, and piety will not delay the wrinkles, and old age, and death, the unsubdued, pressing at their heels - We must leave the earth, our home, and the wife we love, and none of these trees you tend except the hated cypresses will go with their short-lived master [Horace 1997,68]. 2. That uncontrollable things are valueless: Horace emphasizes that whatever is beyond our control cannot be relied upon and that we are the only guardians of ourselves. According to him, there is no point in praying to gods, for they have no pity for men and cannot be won over by votive offerings (Ode 2.16): "Peace of mind," asks Thrace so furious in war. "Peace of mind," cry the Medes with their gorgeous quivers. But peace cannot be bought with jewels, nor with purple or gold [1997, 69]. While Fortune is fickle (Ode 3.29), Fortune enjoys her cruel business and persists in her playing her proud game, transferring her fickle honors, favoring now me, now another [1997, 107]. Our well-being can only be maintained by an independent and steady mind: 3 See Pierre Hadot's arguments in Hadot (2002), especially chapter 9. For him, there is a sort of convergence of Stoic virtue and Epicurean pleasure. As I will argue next, this is true only to a certain degree.</page><page sequence="7">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 121 I praise her (Fortune) while she stays. If she shakes out her swift wings, I return what she gave, wrap myself in my virtue, and look for honest Poverty, the bride that brings no dowry [1997, 107-108]. 3. That the present is one's sole possession: since all we have is the present, Horace sees no point in worrying about the uncontrollable to- morrow (Ode 2.13): No man can ever see for sure from hour to hour what he should avoid. [N]o man foretells the stroke of death which has carried off the peoples of the earth, and always will [1997, 67]. A happy man's virtue lies in his disinterest in future days (Ode 1.9), Don't ask what will happen tomorrow. Whatever day Fortune gives you, enter it as profit [1997, 33]. and his exclusive devotion to the present (Ode 2.16): The mind which finds delight in the present moment should not worry about what is to come, but should dilute all bitterness with a slow smile [1997, 70]. 4. That virtue lies in the proper use of the moment: Horace stresses that no one can deprive you of your achievement as long as you fulfill each moment of your life and refuse to be distracted from it by the past, future, or the gods. In each completed moment of living lies the meaning of your life (3.29): A man will be happy and in control of his life if he can say at each day's end, "I have lived." Tomorrow Father Jupiter can fill the sky with dark cloud or cloudless sunlight, but he will not annul what is behind us, nor will he remake or cancel what the flying hour has taken away [1997, 107]. Horace urges us to harvest the day (carpe diem) (Ode 1.11): Dum loquimur, fugerit invida aetas: carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero (Even as we speak, envious time flies past. Harvest the day and leave as little as possible for tomorrow [1997, 34; see also 1926, 32]. Although Horace shares many of Aurelius's views, the virtue advo- cated by Horace is not Aurelius's disciplined sobriety or meditative tran- quility in a solitary enclosure but a free, relaxed state of mind that enjoys the subtle pleasure of idyllic living and stays clear from worries about what cannot and should not be worried about: Be wise, strain the wine and cut back hope into a small place [1997, 34]. and (Ode 2.3):</page><page sequence="8">122 Journal of Religious Ethics Tell them to bring the wine, the fragrant oils, and the all-too-short-lived flowers of the lovely rose [1997, 58]. While Aurelius's "nowness" is justice and reason, Horace's nunc means bibendum (Ode 1.37): Now we must drink (nunc est bibendum), now we must beat the earth with unfettered feet, now, my friends, is the time to load the couches of the gods with Salian feasts [1997, 54]. Horace could be a serious challenge to Aurelius, for the compatibil- ity of his Epicureanism with the fact that life is short undermines the ethical stance of Aurelius. Although Horace is in spirit much closer to Stoicism than he is to sensualistic hedonism of self-abandonment, he is not a Stoic in the true sense of the word. His moral discourse on virtue is largely instrumental. He talks of virtue because he believes that a man cannot be a true aesthete unless he is virtuous. Horace's virtue is letting go and carefree spontaneity, whereas Aurelius's virtue is dominated by the theme of self-overcoming and self-sacrificing. Drinking would be un- seemly for Aurelius, but for Horace, only the truly free can enjoy drinking. Freedom for Aurelius means being one with the cosmos (a cosmopolitan spirit), obedient to the cosmic reason, and flowing with the cosmic flux (as the paper will show next). For Horace, freedom is still more psycho- logical than metaphysical. It means liberation from the petty, mundane concerns of daily life, and the enjoyment of each moment of living with innocence and spiritual purity. Horace's pleasure is free-wandering. Au- relius does not talk much of pleasure at all. He focuses on cool reason and tranquil meditation. In this sense, while it is important for one to note the spiritual proximity between Horace and Stoicism, to say that Epicureanism and Stoicism simply converge is an overstatement. Ho- race and Aurelius have the same rationale for rejecting this-worldly ob- sessions with wealth, power, mindless sensual indulgence, and libido: time is short, and these things can never bring true happiness. Worldly pursuits are unwise because they are futile. Happy life ought to be tran- quil, content, self-sufficient, free, and independent. However, their final expression of that life is quite different. In Aurelius, happiness is ful- filled by a cosmopolitan man, who comports himself with propriety, car- ries unshakable inner strength, lives quietly, and is never short on broad endurance of adversity and high tolerance of evil. In contrast, Horace is charmed by his country life away from Rome. He likes to chat with wor- thy friends over wine and flowers, laugh heartily for every joy found in simple living, and is contemptuous of worldly sweats and toils. In a word, Horace is a gregarious aesthete, but Aurelius, a saint. The difference between Horace and Aurelius brings a theoretical chal- lenge to the latter. In order to defend his Stoic conviction, Aurelius must</page><page sequence="9">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 123 explain to the Horatians why living in the moment does not mean living as an aesthete. This leads us to this question: what exactly is the virtue of Aurelius's nowness? 5. Aurelius's Mereological Rationality4 When Aurelius speaks of right reasoning or justice, he does not mean ordinary human reason or rationality. Instead, he regards human reason as a mere portion of the cosmic reason. Man's rationality is foremost a cosmic rationality.5 In order for a person to be just and rational, it is not enough for him to be temperate (sophrosune) and fair. He must realize that he is a particle of the universe and a section of history, and fulfill his duty accordingly. Aurelius subscribes to the Stoic belief that the universe as a whole is rational, intelligent, and never functions without a plan (Aurelius 1999, 4.27; see Diogenes Laertius 1959, 7.143). Universal substance and uni- versal time form a well-ordered whole and operate according to the cos- mic managing reason (dioikon logos) (see Aurelius 1999, 5.24, 6.5, 6.9, 12.23). The rationality of the universe is such that human rationality (a deity enthroned in us) exists only by taking a share from the universal reason. Human reason is a particle that "Zeus (namely, the cosmos) has given to every man as his captain and guide" (1999, 5.27).6 In this sense, reason for Aurelius is a seminal reason, for it begets all things that are rational: Thou hast subsisted as part of the whole. Thou shalt vanish into that which begat thee, or rather thou shalt be taken again into its seminal reason (spermatikous logous) by a process of change [1999, 4.14; see also 4.21, 6.24,9.1]. [Think] in unison with the all-embracing intelligence. For that intelligent faculty is everywhere diffused and offers itself on every side to him that can take it in no less than the aerial to him that can breathe [1999, 8.54; see also 9.9]. Under the premise of the cosmic rationality, Aurelius's ideal person, who is just and reasons correctly, is someone who completely trusts in the well-ordered nature of the universe. Whatever befalls us cannot harm 4 Aurelius himself did not use this phrase. Despite its awkwardness, this paper sticks to it because it represents a key feature in Aurelius's ethics: the reason of a part is derived from the whole to which the part belongs. 5 Compare Aurelius dike to Socrates's dikaiosune. 6 See also 3.6. Epictetus says that because we have a portion of God within ourselves, we feed and exercise God when we feed and exercise ourselves (1937, LX, 137).</page><page sequence="10">124 Journal of Religious Ethics us - a commitment to this thesis is really what Aurelius's human ratio- nality ultimately means: If the Gods [that is, the seminal reason] have taken counsel about me and the things to befall me, doubtless they have taken good counsel. For it is not easy even to imagine a God without wisdom. And what motive could they have impelling them to do me evil? For what advantage could thereby accrue to them or to the universe which is in their special care? But if the Gods have taken no counsel for me individually, yet they have in any case done so for the interests of the universe, and I am bound to welcome and make the best of those things also that befall as a necessary corollary to those interests [1999, 6.44; see also 6.45]. For Aurelius, even disease, torture, and death cannot be bad for us because they, as natural phenomena, must happen for good reasons: That which is not hurtful to the community cannot hurt the individual. Test every case of apparent hurt by this rule: if the community be not hurt by this, neither am I hurt [1999, 5.22]. 7 As particles, we share our interest with the whole. It serves us to endure adversities and build fortitude by welcoming whatever befalls, but cannot harm us: It is well. Everything that befalls was from the beginning destined and spun for thee as thy share out of the whole [1999, 4.26]. Furthermore, we ought to look after each other, because we share the common well-being of mankind too: We are all fellow-workers towards the fulfillment of one object, some of us knowingly and intelligently, others blindly [1999, 6.42]. If anyone is selfish, he is only a fugitive from the universe: He is an exile, who exiles himself from civic reason; blind, he who will not see with the eyes of his understanding; a beggar, he who is dependent on another, and cannot draw from his own resources all that his life requires; an imposthume on the universe, he who renounces, and severs himself from, the reason of our common nature, because he is ill pleased at what happens [1999,4.29]. In the end, Aurelius arrives at the two most important principles of his ethics: self-reliance and fellowship. One should be self-reliant and not seek help from others because he should forbear whatever comes to him, while his fellowship toward others represents the common interest of mankind. 7 See also 10.6, 10.7, 10.11. See Seneca (1918, LXVII).</page><page sequence="11">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 125 6. Aurelius's Paradox The tension within Aurelius's ethics is twofold: there is a strain be- tween the virtue of koinonia and that of self-reliance, and between the theses that the meaning of life is to be found in the moment we live in and that individual existence is an inseparable part of history and the world. First, if whatever befalls us cannot hurt us, and forbearance is the only right attitude toward adversities, why do we need to develop fellow- ship with each other? Does not fraternal fellowship undermine the idea of self-reliance? If whatever befalls us cannot hurt us, genuine suffering would be impossible, for suffering seems inconsistent with the managing rationality of the universe. If this is true, it would seem superfluous for us to develop a communal bond with each other - it would be a gratuitous expenditure of our emotional energy. Second, by stressing the momentary nature of living, Aurelius wants to show us that it is not worthwhile for people to struggle for fame or anything that is supposed to carry historical value. According to him, avarice, hubris, and all egoistic behavior really reflect a fundamental misreading of the value of living. People should recognize their insignif- icance and their inability to control anything beyond the present mo- ment. But if this is true, why would Aurelius at the same time urge us to live as citizens of the world? Why should we maintain a histor- ical awareness when all that matters to us is the present moment? If we are as insignificant as Aurelius claims, why should we bother with the cultivation of virtue? Why not listen to Horace's exhortation of "carpe diem" and give the present moment only the meaning of aesthetic inebriation? For Horace, nunc (now) means drink to the lees. His Epicureanism seems more consistent with Aurelius's thesis that life is in the moment than is his own moral dictum that we must make profit of the present by being just and reasonable. 7. Kairos, Nature, and Change In the last passage, when we question the purpose and necessity of building fellowship with each other, we are tacitly assuming that there is a natural conflict between self-care and care for others. This is exactly what Aurelius denies. According to him, it is natural for people to bond with each other, whereas egoistic obsession with one's own welfare is unnatural and a perversion of one's natural interest. In Aurelius's view, we as parts of the universe have been naturally equipped with a reason that is socially and collectively conscious. When Aurelius urges one to rely on himself, he means that the person should take his own nature as his guide:</page><page sequence="12">126 Journal of Religious Ethics Look not about thee at the ruling Reason of others, but look with straight eyes at this, To what is Nature guiding thee? - both the Nature of the Uni- verse, by means of what befalls thee and thy nature by means of the acts thou hast to do. But everyone must do what follows from his own consti- tution; and all other things have been constituted for the sake of rational beings [1999, 7.55; emphasis in original]. According to Aurelius, there would be no conflict with self-reliance and fellowship because koinonikon (social obligation) is "the leading feature in the constitution of man" (1999, 7.55; see also 4.33, 6.14, 6.23, 8.7, and passim). It is in the context of the uniformity between one's individual nature and the Nature of the universe that Aurelius articulates his ethical vi- sion. All actions that follow our nature are morally good. For Aurelius, all morally good actions are also well-timed actions. They are well-timed (kairon), because it is through them that we maintain our harmony with the universe as well as the inner harmony within ourselves. For Aurelius, the concept of timeliness justifies the significance of moral cultivation and explains the significance of our natural, albeit insignificant, exis- tence. Although our life is brief, we are able to live up to the "season" of the universe by being just and magnanimous. It is the passing of gener- ations, Aurelius claims, that keeps the universal nature "ever youthful and in its prime," Any single form of activity, be it what it may, ceasing in its own due season (kairon), suffers no ill because it hath ceased, nor does the agent suffer in that it hath ceased to act. Similarly then if life, that sum total of all our acts, ceases in its own good time (kairon), it suffers no ill from this very fact, nor is he in an ill plight who has brought this chain of acts to an end in its own due time (kairon). The due season (kairon) and the terminus are fixed by nature, at times even by our individual nature, as when in old age, but in any case by the universal nature, the constant change of whose parts keeps the whole universe ever youthful and in its prime. All that is advantageous to the whole is ever fair and in its bloom. The ending of life then is not only no evil to the individual - for it brings him no disgrace, if in fact it be both outside our choice and not inimical to the general weal - but a good, since it is timely (kairon) for the universe, bears its share in it and is borne along with it. For then is he, who is borne along on the same path as God, and borne in his judgment towards the same things, indeed a man god-borne [1999, 12.23; see 11.13; my emphasis]. It is clear that timeliness forms the metaphysical foundation for Aurelius's moral discourse. Horace's Epicureanism, although consistent with the thesis that life is short, does not reflect the "divine" arrange- ment of nature that makes man worthy of moral cultivation. By living in accordance with nature (his individual nature as well as the universal</page><page sequence="13">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 127 nature), a man can blossom like a flower in his timely fashion, whereas an incontinent seeking of pleasure contradicts his natural grace. It is important not to overstate the moral significance of a person. While a timely action means living up to one's nature and maintaining the youth of nature, an individual's significance would be so small that he can never claim the honor of making any positive contribution to the growth of nature, just as a single blossom can never make any difference to a spring season. Timeliness really means that the only significance of a person is his insignificance and his wisdom in staying so. The world is in constant transformation. It serves his interest for a person to go along with the flow of events. If he refuses to go along, the universal flux will sweep him along. Under this perspective, a person should un- derstand that all events of his life are ultimately timely and there is no objective reason for anyone to express personal grief and undergo mental agitations over the change of things. Aurelius's Stoic serenity manifests a supreme confidence in the natural order of the world. For him, timeli- ness means the natural unity between man and nature and there is no evil in the objective world. In Aurelius's philosophy, timeliness, nature, and the ironclad law of change are conceptually and mutually supportive. A person's moral wis- dom lies in his willingness to embrace his nature and submit to the necessity of change. In his doing so, his actions are timely. In contrast, any untimely struggle is not only futile but also disgraceful. It is futile because it will not change anything. It will not even diminish to the slightest degree the goodness of the world. It is disgraceful to the person, for the desperate struggle reduces him to something like a screaming Pig- While human dignity is maintained through man's submission to his insignificance, the meaning of timeliness is limited by the law of change in the following three ways: (1) Nature cannot be affected by human activities. Aurelius stresses that the world is too forceful to be influenced by men. Nature's insuscepti- bility constitutes a fundamental reason why human virtue lies in the ac- knowledgment of the insignificance of individual life. Aurelius compares the world to a revolving cylinder, the parts of which have no resistance against its general motion: A cylinder we know has no power given it of individual motion everywhere, nor has fire or water or any other thing controlled by Nature or by an irrational soul. For the interposing and impeding obstacles are many. But Intelligence and Reason make their way through every impediment just as their nature or their will prompts them - [Reason] can force its way through every obstacle, as fire upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder down a slope, looking for nothing beyond [1999, 10.33].</page><page sequence="14">128 Journal of Religious Ethics Nature always has her way, "the World-Cause is as a torrent, it sweeps everything along. How negligible these manikins that busy themselves with civic matters and flatter themselves that they act therein as philoso- phers!" (1999, 9.29). (2) Although the distinction between good and evil makes sense in the human realm, everything is neutral (amphoteros) to the whole. From the view of the whole, Aurelius claims, the good and the wicked are all legit- imate parts of the same unity. A wise person would not grieve about the malice of others but "feel kindly towards them, for nature made them dear to [him]" (1999, 9.27). In Aurelius's ethics, the neutrality of the whole toward good and evil speaks volumes about the moral insignifi- cance of human agency in terms of its infinitesimal cosmic impact, [Those] , who are of one mind with nature and would walk in her ways, must hold a neutral attitude towards those things towards which the universal nature is neutral - for she would not be the maker of both were she not neutral towards both [1999, 9.1]. While the good cannot help the universe, wickedness cannot harm it either. Human morality makes no difference to what is natural (see Aurelius 1999, 3.2, 9.42, 7.27, 7.70). (3) The history of the world is an eternal cyclic return. Aurelius quotes Heraclitus for his cyclic view of the world's transformation, "the death of earth is to pass into water, and the death of water pass into air, and of air to pass into fire, and so back again" (1999, 4.46). Aurelius believes in the global recurrence of world history: [This] must needs be remembered: [all] things from time everlasting have been cast in the same mould and repeated cycle after cycle, and so it makes no difference whether a man see the same things recur through a hundred years or two hundred, or through eternity [1999, 2.14; see also 5.13, 5.32, 9.28, 10.7, 11.1]. In this sense evolution becomes revolution. Progress and degeneration are deprived of their moral significance once history is understood to be a matter of constant repetition. For Aurelius, while the change is universal and cannot be interfered with, a man can secure his peace and happiness only through acting in a timely fashion (Aurelius 1999, 9.19, 5.23). This means that he should abide by his nature, forbear anything that might happen to him, let his insignificant flower blossom in the right season, and display his natural affinity toward others. In doing so, he would be just, magnanimous, and truly rational. At this point, there is still something poignant about Aurelius's ethics. He completes his moral theory only with a final thesis that denies the significance of human activity in toto. His concept ofkairos is supposed to</page><page sequence="15">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 129 save human dignity in the overwhelming face of human history, but ends up only saying that human significance is his insignificance. What seems most implausible, in this context, is his Stoic "cult" of forbearance. Ac- cording to him, by forbearing everything with utmost tranquility, a man becomes equal to god. In order to appreciate these fine points concerning Aurelius's doctrine, let us compare him to Confucius. As we will see in the next section, Confucius has a different theory of change and a probably more interesting theory of timeliness that goes with it. 8. Confucius: The Two Meanings of Timeliness The connection between the two concepts, kairos and change, is obvi- ous. Unless the world is in constant mutation, the issue of being in sea- son never arises. The exact meaning of kairos depends on the meaning of change. Since Aurelius almost exclusively writes of the great evolution of the universal substance, in Aurelius's ethics, conducting oneself in a timely manner becomes a matter of accepting objective reality and not trying to halt or to interrupt the flux of history. However, if one lives in a seriously degenerated era fraught with war and injustice, should one embrace all the ills of the world with the same unperturbed idea of timeliness? Even if Aurelius denies the possibility of an epochal degener- ation (which he does, obviously), he still needs to convince us why human suffering does not matter to us. As a matter of fact, his persecution of Christians seems to speak against his own teaching. Since there must be a cosmic reason for the Christian movements, why should Aurelius suppress them? When Confucius deliberates about the state of the world in which he lives, the problem of change is constantly on his mind. He takes upon himself the Mandate of Heaven and urges the various state rulers to adopt his reformist agenda. Some hermits who are likely prede- cessors of Daoists often ridicule him, according to The Analects, for not understanding the truth of yi (change). Daoism believes that it is unwise for anyone to advocate for change because the world itself is constantly changing. A hermit reproaches a young man for following Confucius: Under Heaven there is none that is not swept along by the same flood. Such is the world and who can change it? As for you, instead of following one who flees from this man and that, you would do better to follow one who shuns this whole generation of men [Confucius 1989, 18.6]. Confucius's failure in his own lifetime seems to prove the hermit's point that later becomes the general view of Daoism. It prompts a Daoist- like doorman on another occasion to call Confucius a master of futility (Confucius 1989, 14.41).</page><page sequence="16">130 Journal of Religious Ethics In a way, Confucius agrees with Daoists. He knows that it is untimely to bring about the changes he wants, and thus his effort is destined to fail. He is as acutely aware of time as any Daoist could be. He shows great admiration for any movement in man or nature that reveals proper adaptiveness. He does not hesitate to praise the one who seeks office when the Way prevails but withdraws from the world when the Way does not (Confucius 1989, 8.13). Observing on a hill bridge a pheasant that rises at the disturbance of human motion but settles when it sees no danger, Confucius eulogizes its sensitivity by simply saying, "How timely! How timely!" (Shi zai! Shi zai!) (10.18). On one occasion, as a Daoist-like madman passes his door singing, O Phoenix! O Phoenix! How dwindled is your power! As to past, reproof is idle; but the future may yet be remedied. Confucius shows him great respect by trying to converse with him (18.5). Confucius thinks so highly of the philosophy of timeliness that, at the age of seventy, he wishes that a few more years could be added to his life so that he can further study The Book of Change (Yi Jing). He had by that date already spent significant time studying and editing the ancient classics. He lamented the degeneration of his age, perfectly aware of his doomed mission: The Phoenix does not come; the river sends forth no chart: - it is all over with me! [9.8] .8 Sometimes he even expresses the desire for a Daoistic retreat: My doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea [5.6]. Confucius is amenable to Daoism because he understands the untime- liness of his wish, but he does not become a Daoist because he believes that, although his endeavor is untimely, it is timely for him to make the untimely effort. He knows that his travail will bear no fruit because the world is too degenerate to make room for the success of a single person determined to stem the reckless flow of the sinister currents. Jun zi (the virtuous person) does what is right. He does not "accuse Heaven, nor lay the blame on men" (Confucius 1989, 14.37). His devotion to righteous- ness ought to be firm enough to make him a willing "master of futility" when he is faced with impossible odds. To modify one's action according to the possibility of success constitutes an expedient strategic wisdom. But utilitarian thinking should not dictate matters of principle: 8 The Phoenix and the chart are auspicious omens.</page><page sequence="17">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 131 Ajun zi takes as much trouble to discover what is right as lesser men take to discover what will pay [Confucius 1989, 4.16]. Ajun zi's service to his country consists in doing the right things as he can. That the Way does not prevail, he knows well enough beforehand [18.7; my emphasis] . Although his exertion may be untimely in terms of its social efficacy, it is always timely, Confucius teaches, for ajun zi to exemplify the good. The recognition of the principle of change does not neutralize man's ability to influence the course of the universal flux. Change is not just a reality a man grows into, but also a manifestation of the evolution of social mores and the political destiny of a nation. The humanistic proclivity of Confucianism anchors man to a particular bearing in nature. Humans are never simply ignominious particles that are swept along with other sentient and nonsentient beings. Man creates culture and is able to understand the Mandate of Heaven.9 Human activities can facilitate, promote, and set in order the growth of nature, but they can also corrupt, disturb, and delay the will of Heaven. Heaven influences man, and man affects Heaven, too. Man is the greatest form of life in nature, and human effort often results in cultural products that are good and valuable. No one places a higher confidence in man than does Xun Zi, a Confucian scholar in the third century BCE, Heaven has its seasons, Earth has its resources, man has his culture. This is what is meant [when it is said that man] is able to form a trinity [with Heaven and Earth] [see Fung 1948, 144]. In order to show his recognition of the importance of human agency, Confucius at one occasion recommends the calendar of Xia instead of that used by Zhou, despite his being a follower of Zhou. The calendar of Xia counts March as the beginning of a year because March is believed to be the month of man (Confucius 1989, 15. 10).10 Instead of the Daoist formula of following the flow {shun dao), Confucius emphasizes man's duty to promote the prevailing of the Way (hong dao): "A man can enlarge the Way; but there is no Way that can enlarge a man" (15.28). There are two main consequences of Confucius's theory of change, which acknowledges the unique ability of man. First, the degeneration of the world is possible. The evolution of the world is a succession of different periods whose states of affairs are complicated by the cultural and political activities of human beings. A corrupt generation of people 9 The Mandate of Heaven is rather an obscure concept in Confucianism. But Heaven is definitely not an anthropomorphic God. In Confucian terminology, nature itself is often called Heaven or Heaven and Earth. 10 See Zhu-xi's commentary on this point, in Zhu (1982, 163-4).</page><page sequence="18">132 Journal of Religious Ethics can seriously hinder the operations of the Way by wreaking havoc on the face of Earth. Second, a good and upright man such as s.jun zi has a duty to correct the decline and is often in the long run, or even posthumously, capable of doing so. Yu, an ideal persona in Confucianism, is always eulogized for taming the wild rivers and later becomes the prototype of the Chinese political figure. For "to govern" (zhi) means in its original sense "to channel the river."11 The realistic acknowledgment of human mortality and the insignifi- cance of any single person, leads Confucius and his followers to a com- plicated sense of timeliness. In terms of the corruptibility of the world and the corresponding individual duty, it is always timely for a person to strive for the good and order. But in terms of the feebleness of a few good men's efforts, the hard reality and the fragility of life may give them no chance. In the second sense, the timeliness of a person's endeavor is just a matter of luck. That is why it is not uncommon for an ancient Confucian scholar to lament his ill fortune of living in the wrong era. 9. Su's Melancholy In order to illustrate my point on the Confucian understanding of timeliness, let us take a look at the poem "Ode to Red Cliff by Su Shi, the talented and colorful eleventh-century Confucian poet: The waves of the mighty river flowing eastward Have swept away the brilliant figures of a thousand generations. West of the old rampart, So people say, is Lord Zhou's Red Cliff of the time of the Three Kingdoms. The tumbling rocks thrust into the air; The roaring surges dash upon the shore, Rolling into a thousand drifts of snow. The River and the mountains make a vivid picture - What a host of heroes once were! And I recall the young Lord then, Newly married to the fair Younger Qiao, His valorous features shown forth; With a feather fan and silken cap He talked and laughed, putting his enemy's ships to ashes and smoke. While my thoughts wander in the country of old, People might smile at my deep sentiments. My hair turned gray too soon. 11 The Greeks such as Plato and Aristotle regard pilots and weavers, and the ancient Hebrew take shepherds as their prototypes of politicians. The Chinese instead speaks of Yu, the hydrographer and landscapes For Yu's story, see Legge (1865, 93-151).</page><page sequence="19">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 133 Ah! Life is but like a dream; With a cup of wine, let me yet pour a libation to the moon on the River [Su 1965, 356-7]. In this poem, the protagonist Zhou Yu is the youthful commander- in-chief of the State of Wu of the third century (The Era of The Three Kingdoms). Although the poet mourns for the emptiness of Zhou's histor- ical brilliance, his sentiment is rather a mixture of melancholy and envy. Compare Su's Confucian pathos to that of Shelley's poem "Ozymandias" (Ozymandias is the Greek name of Ramses II of Egypt): I met a traveler from an antique land, Who said - "two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert Near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal, these words appear: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away [Shelley 1993, 672]. The parallels of the details in the two poems are impressive. Simi- lar images portray the hubris of the two ancient men: "[Ozymandias's] frown," his "wrinkled lip," and "sneer of cold command" corresponds to Zhou's talking and laughing, holding "a feather fan," and donning a "silken cap." The flux of the Yangtze replaces the Egyptian desert. Silent sands echo the roaring waves. The meaning of time in the two poems reveals itself through landscape - it outlasts everything. The glories of the past are as difficult to trace as the desert is easy to see and the waves are easy to hear. Similarities notwithstanding, the moods of the two poems are quite different. Shelley mocks. He reveals the emptiness of Ozymandias's con- ceit through the decayed empty space. In "Ode to Red Cliff," the sense of irony is displaced by reverence and melancholy. In contrast to Shelley's distanced perspective, Su identifies with the ancient hero. Lamenting for the vanished splendor of Zhou, he laments for the vanishing vivac- ity of his own life, "my hair turned gray too soon. Ah! Life is but like a dream." Su does not put himself outside the flux of time and mock the youthful ardor of his protagonist. For Su, youth is precious and admirable, as well as fragile and vulnerable. His ritualistic pouring of wine to the moon affirms his spiritual fellowship with the past heroes.</page><page sequence="20">134 Journal of Religious Ethics Life is vivacious fragility. This is true to Zhou as well as to the poet himself. On the one hand, Su laments the shortness of life and the merciless flux of the historical river. Everything in the past has gone, and nothing that is active now will remain in the near future. On the other hand, he has only envy and admiration for Zhou, for he lived, lived well, and lived in a timely way. The Confucian sentiments of historical optimism (the Way will prevail due to the efforts of the good) and personal realism (we belong to history, but our lives are short) are typified in the melancholy we encounter in the poem. For Confucians, man is a part of Heaven and Earth, but Heaven and Earth are not a part of man. Seasons return after they depart; the grasses will revive after their death. They always have their time. But man's path is irreversible - the time may never be his.12 10. The Importance of Degeneration The complexity of the Confucian idea of timeliness exposes the weak point of Aurelius's ethics. Aurelius's unbalanced emphasis on the virtue of the whole precludes the possibility of a universal degeneration. If the world is always in its prime season and nothing that happens to a man can be called untimely, all the virtues that are demanded of an individual would only lead him to a life of absolute passivity. The movement of change would become strictly one-directional: humans are transformed by, but cannot transform the world. The absolute neutralization of human agency is detrimental to Aurelius's ethics, because it is detrimental to any other ethics. If the world forever runs on its fine course no matter what humans do, it must be good and advantageous to the world and humans, for us to forfeit all moral concerns. That is exactly what Daoism advocates. Since the constant transfor- mation (wu hud) of the universal substance {da kuai: the Great Clod) leaves no room for human interference, it would be in the interest of everyone to reject humanistic morality and leave things alone (wu- wei: doing nothing).13 Lao Zi's remark cannot be more straightforward, 12 This kind of sentiment is reflected in an ancient Chinese burial song (see Waley 1997, 58): How swiftly it dies, The dew on the garlic-leaf. The dew that dries so fast Tomorrow will fall again. But he whom we carry to the grave Will never more return. I thank Antony Flew for directing my attention to this poem. 16 For da kuai (the Great Clod) and wu hua (universal transformation), see Chuang Tzu (1968, 36, 49). For discussions on wu-wei (doing nothing), see Zhu (2002, 53-63).</page><page sequence="21">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 135 "Eliminate sages, discard knowledge, people will be profited a hundred- fold" (Lao Zi 1963, chap. 19, 149). The dissolution of morality is not a problem for Daoism because it is not an ethical doctrine.14 But if a self- proclaimed ethical theory such as Aurelius's Stoicism implies that we dismiss normativity, it ought to be a case for serious concern. If one argues that Aurelius is not really moralizing excessively - he only needs forbearance and fellowship - another Daoist-like move will prove to be near fatal to him. Provided that we are interconnected as parts of the same world, why should we be concerned for others if the withdrawal of our interest will not harm anyone while increasing our own psychological well-being? If we truly share common interests, but the agency that affects the quality of the interests comes only from the whole, there is no reason why we should worry about each other. If the transformations (metabolen) of the world are absolutely independent of us, there is hardly any ethical ground for Aurelius to establish the prin- ciple of koinonia, however, koinos we actually are. If the universal sub- stance is always in its season and a worldwide degeneration is impossible, there is every reason for us to believe in the desirability of a Daoist little kingdom, where people have no interest in seeing each other, Though neighboring communities overlook one another and the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs can be heard, yet the people there may grow old and die without ever visiting one another [Lao Zi 1963, chap. 80, 175]. 11. Humanism and Suffering Reflecting on all those aforementioned resolutions of the dilemma be- tween human agency and cosmic order, we put the philosophies of Confu- cius and Aurelius in perspective. Compared with other philosophical or nonphilosophical resolutions, their theories distinguish themselves from 14 Due to the size of the article, my characterization of Daoism here is, as one of the referees of this journal correctly points out, somewhat simplistic or even problematic. In order not to blow the paper out of proportion, I have decided to stick to the sketch I have presented in the text. After all, the general amoral stance of Daoism is still true. Some scholars argue that amoralism is more true to Zhuang Zi (Chuang Tzu) than to Lao Zi, for the latter has a clear philosophy of government, leadership, and virtuous rulership. There is no question that Lao Zi is as politically minded as Confucius is, but the political "virtue" Lao Zi advocates for is amoralistic in the sense that it is somewhat closer to Machiavelli's virtu than to Aurelius's dike or Confucius's ren. With regard to the issue of human agency in the midst of cosmic order, Daoism, particularly in Zhuang Zi, presents another complicated and equally interesting theory side by side with Confucius and Aurelius. As the aforemen- tioned referee points out to me, the Woodworker Qing in the nineteenth chapter of Chuang Tzu empties his mind (while making bellstands), and lets the cosmos work through him. Through Qing "heaven (tian) matches up with heaven." That is, Qing engages in a kind of active passivity (wu wei) or spiritual spontaneity (zi ran) that enables the cosmos to carve itself in the form of a bellstand. The referee's opinion is excellent, and I wish I could address this issue here. But the complexity of the issue and the narrative integrity of this article demand a future occasion for this matter.</page><page sequence="22">136 Journal of Religious Ethics the rest by trying to secure a balance between man and the world through philosophizing over the concept of timeliness, without using theistic con- cepts (except expediently or pro forma). Through the efforts of Confucius and Aurelius, we come to realize the enormous importance of kairos and shi for Chinese and pre-Christian Western moral thinking. Without an anthropomorphic God hovering above, man finds himself completely for- lorn in the midst of nature. It is through shi and kairos that philosophers offer an alternative, pragmatically and theoretically plausible route to a way of life that stays clear of absolute passivity or spiritual abandon- ment. Knowing that a grand statement is in general an unwise thing to make, I am ready to say here that one cannot truly appreciate the pre- carious context of many ancient ethical theories without understanding first the conceptual significance of timeliness. It is through kairos that Aurelius deduces his rationalistic moral perspective from the realization that life is short. Similarly, it is through shi that Confucius pushes his humanistic personal values to the front. Without kairos, Aurelius would have to yield to Epicureanism or even vulgar hedonism. Without shi, the doctrine of Confucius would fall prey to Daoist free-wandering and Buddhist world-spurning. However, it is also important to know that both Confucius's and Aurelius's theories are somewhat unsatisfying. If one values theoreti- cal coherence more than anything else, one could argue that Confucius's resolution of the dilemma between human agency and cosmic order is not acceptable. In a profound sense, Confucius has not really resolved man's existential ambivalence, but rather left it intact. His double rendition of the concept of timeliness mirrors the original ambivalence of man's situ- ation in the world. According to him, man can influence history through a collective effort in the long run, but an individual's existence is precar- ious and susceptible to the influence of external conditions. Man is still left in the quandary, feeling vulnerable and insecure against the fluctua- tion of history. This explains Su's melancholy and the general Confucian struggle between historical optimism and personal realism. However, despite this formalistic deficiency of Confucius's thought, it is clear that Confucianism is a deeply humanistic doctrine. It treats man as man, recognizing his cultural potential along with his weakness, fragility, and even his ability to cause evil. In comparison with other humanistic the- ories, Confucianism does not simply put man at the center or promote this-worldly values, but also represents a particular pathos, a feeling of aloofness and melancholy. This aloofness is most obvious in Confucius and Mencius, the first two sages of Confucianism. It is only at a much later stage when Confucianism has accumulated enough of the dust and dirt of orthodoxy that its aloofness begins to fade out, and more and more inhuman practices are committed in the very name of Confucian humanism and historicism.</page><page sequence="23">Kairos: Between Cosmic Order and Human Agency 137 Compared to Confucius, Aurelius's resolution is somewhat decisive. For him, timeliness means man's absolute submission to fate and the cultivation of an immovable spirit of fortitude. Man is both belittled and elevated in his doctrine. This is no abnormality, since unnatural elevation often means degradation. Through his philosophy of change and his pro- motion of the mereological rationality, Aurelius rules out the possibility of suffering and the epochal degeneration of the world. If man never suffers, he becomes a seasonal flower as well as god. The Stoic general tendency in dismissing all human agonies represents a profound depar- ture from the earlier, Socratic culture of humanization.15 Aurelius's promotion of koinonia could have balanced out the radical all-good forbearance, but the immovability of world history turns out to be too much for such an impossibly detached man - it devours him. Aurelius's koinonia really means a denial of individuality and an abso- lute triumph of a naturalistic vision over man and the world. In this sense, his concept of timeliness fails to deliver what it is supposed to offer - that is, to reach a genuine balance between man and nature. 15 There is no question that Aurelius and Stoicism, in general, promote reason and regard it as definitive of man. But the promotion of human value is not the same thing as humanism, just as the promotion of greed or pleasure is not automatically humanism either. It must regard man as a complete creature, being capable of good as well as evil, rational as well as irrational. In this sense, humanism promotes reason as well as feeling and emotion. Stoicism and Aurelius "dehumanize" man exactly because they regard human emotion as false and unworthy. Not a Romanticist by any means, I believe that the Romantic revolt against Enlightenment and rationalism is a right movement toward a profound humanism. REFERENCES Aurelius, Marcus 1999 Meditations.
