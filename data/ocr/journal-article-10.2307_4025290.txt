<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE: PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE AND MAN By ROGER SMITH* I HISTORIANS of the Victorian period have begun to re-evaluate the general background and impact of Darwin's theory of the origin of species by means of natural selection. An emerging picture suggests that the Darwin- ian theory of evolution was only one aspect (albeit, a major aspect) of a more general change in intellectual positions.' It is possible to summarize two correlated developments in the second half of the nineteenth century: the secularization of major areas of thought, and the increasing breakdown of a common intellectual milieu. Studies in linguistics, historical criticism, socio-political theory, theology, and anthropology, besides evolutionary theory, contributed to these developments.2 It has also been argued that the background of evolutionary thought lay within a relatively unified early Victorian intellectual context with shared religious, moral, and scientific concepts.3 Evolutionary theory contributed to the disintegration of this shared context, but it did not intrinsically assume a clear demarca- tion between value-laden (ethical or religious) ideas and scientific ideas. On the one hand, in the later Victorian period, religious and scientific intellectuals found it increasingly hard to share common ground.4 On the other hand, they did sometimes share an enthusiasm for applying biological models to social and ethical theory. It is necessary to look closely before ascribing any increased differentiation of positions to the impact of evolutionary biology. Alfred Russel Wallace was the co-founder of the theory of natural selection and one of its most tenacious defenders. It is therefore of great interest that Wallace emphatically opposed a demarcation between ethical * Department of History, University of Lancaster, Bailrigg, Lancaster.

He endeavoured to combine notions of value with his scientific theory of evolution, particularly in relation to man. British biologists in the first half of the nineteenth cen- tury characteristically analysed their data in terms of the teleological framework of Natural Theology. Evolutionary theory supposedly demol- ished this framework.5 Nevertheless, Wallace incorporated a fundamental teleology into all his theories. He considered that he had thereby recon- ciled the tensions of scientific and ethical demands in his contribution to the evolutionary debate on man's place in nature. This study of Wallace's thought will therefore, first, support the consideration of evolutionary theory within a broad context of ideas, and, second, question the generality of the thesis that the evolutionists advocated a secularization of science and a demarcation between value- laden and scientific discussion. Besides these general considerations, I will argue for the relevance of Victorian psychological methods and theories to the evolutionary debate. This debate did not often discuss explicitly the importance of the theory of evolution for man's mind; the contemporary debate concerning man's mind centred on physiological psychology and the philosophical mind-body problem.6 Yet Wallace's ideas reveal a community of issues between evolution and psychology. Indeed, his theory of the evolution of man cannot be understood apart from his theory of psychology. For where- as it has been customary to consider his thought as primarily biological and his digressions into phrenology, spiritualism, socialism, and ethnology as peripheral,7 these apparently diverse subjects were in reality aspects of a unified interpretation of the world in terms of humanitarian values.8 Since these values profoundly influenced his scientific theory, it is not possible to draw distinctions between his 'scientific' and his 'extra- scientific' work. I shall therefore consider his theory of the evolution of man and its relations to phrenology, spiritualism, the psychological account of causal determination, and socio-political questions. 5 E.g.

II McKinney has recently studied the development of Wallace's theory of general evolution by means of natural selection.9 Wallace extended his theory to include man in his paper on 'The origin of human races and the antiquity of man deduced from the theory of "Natural Selection"' (i864).Io He argued that the theory of natural selection could shed light on the vexed problem of whether there was more than one human species. His conclusions were important and novel: first, that man's physical form had evolved before his mental characteristics and at an earlier period of geological history than was usually assumed; second, that the advent of mind changed the whole course of evolution. The latter con- clusion implied that when man acquired his mental attributes, his body was no longer susceptible to natural selection. Instead, man adapted by intellectual control of his environment and by the development of benevolent social relations. The mental means of control and the social relations therefore became liable to selection. The presence of mind in man seemed to Wallace to imply a radical break in evolutionary history: for the first time there existed an organism that did not have to change physically in order to survive in a changing environment. Further, man himself could change the environment. From the moment when the first skin was used as a covering, when the first rude spear was formed to assist in the chase, when fire was first used to cook his food, when the first seed was sown or shoot planted, a grand revolution was effected in nature-a revolution which in all the previous ages of the earth's history had had no parallel, for a being had arisen who was no longer necessarily subject to change with the changing universe- a being who was in some degree superior to nature, inasmuch as he knew how to control and regulate her action, and could keep himself in harmony with her, not by a change in body, but by an advance of mind. Here, then, we see the true grandeur and dignity of man. On this view of his special attributes, we may admit that even those who claim for him a position as an order, a class, or a sub-kingdom by himself, have some show of reason on their side. He is, indeed, a being apart, since he is not 9 H. L.

Nay more: this victory which he has gained for himself, gives him a directing influence over other existences. Man has not only escaped natural selection himself, but he is actually able to take away some of that power from nature which before his appearance she universally exercised.[" Wallace outlined a discontinuity between man and animals because man could take intellectual control of the selective process. He did not outline the continuity and gradation between the selective process operating on the physical form of organisms and the selective process operated by the human mind. Although Darwin was impressed by Wallace's paper, he had reserva- tions on particular points,I2 and subsequently he and Wallace came to disagree fundamentally on the evolution of man. The germ of this divergence was contained in Wallace's recognition of distinct physical and mental stages in the history of man. While accepting that man's physical characteristics had evolved by means of natural selection, Wallace implied that this had not necessarily been the case for man's mental characteristics. But while these [physical] changes had been going on, his mental develop- mient had,from some unknown cause, greatly advanced, and had now reached that condition in which it began powerfully to influence his whole existence, and would therefore become subject to the irresistible action of natural selection. This action would quickly give the ascendency to mind: speech would probably now be first developed, leading to a still further advance of the mental faculties; and from that moment man, as regards the form and structure of most parts of his body, would remain almost stationary. 13 I shall later elucidate what he meant by evolution 'from some unknown cause. Wallace's paper on 'The origin of human races' provided a descrip- tive account of man's evolutionary history. His first explanatory specula- tion on the mechanism of the evolution of man's mental attributes was contained in a review of the tenth edition of Charles Lyell's Principles of geology.'4 Wallace's work in evolutionary biology was based on a rigid application of the principle of utility. This principle requires an organism, or the components of an organism, to be positively adaptive in order to I" Wallace, op. cit. (io), p. I82.

See note I o.</page><page sequence="5">Alfred Russel Wallace: Phzilosophy of Nature and Man X8I survive.I5 Wallace was more rigid than Darwin in his application of this principle.i6 It is important to note that the principle of utility which led Wallace to argue for evolution by means of natural selection also led him to argue for the insufficiency of natural selection in accounting for the evolution of particular human physical and mental attributes. He felt it was significant that man was 'the question which all who have written upon evolution have neglected'.I7 This neglect, reinforced by the variety of human qualities which appeared to demonstrate inutility, led him to argue that 'we must therefore admit the possibility that in the develop- ment of the human race, a Higher Intelligence has guided the same laws for nobler ends'.i8 Beside his copy of this sentence, Darwin scribbled 'No' followed by a series of exclamation marks.I9 In a letter to Wallace, Darwin wrote: I presume that your remarks on Man are those to which you alluded in your note. If you had not told me I should have thought they had been added by someone else. As you expected, I differ grievously from you, and I am very sorry for it. I can see no necessity for calling in an additional and proximate cause in regard to man.20 Wallace expanded his remarks in his essay on 'The limits of natural selection as applied to man' (i 870)."2 He based his argument on a rigorous application of the principle of utility: if there are characteristics exhibiting inutility, then natural selection cannot be the sole means of human evolu- tion. If, therefore, we find in man any characters, which all the evidence we can obtain goes to show would have been actually injurious to him on their first appearance, they could not possibly have been produced by natural selection. Neither could any specially developed organ have been so I 5 Wallace did not have an objective measurement of utility. The question of neutral factors in adaptation has remained a difficult problem in evolutionary biology; see George, op. cit. (7), pp. 72-4, 252-62. I6 Darwin diluted his theory of natural selection with a belief in the inheritance of acquired characteristics; see Darwin, The origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life (6th edn., London, I872); G. J. Romanes, Darwin and after Darwin. Darwinian theory and a discussion of post-Darwinian questions (London, I892-7), ii. 20-35. Vorzimmer, op. cit. (io), argues that Darwin did not radically alter successive editions of The origin of species in response to criticism as other historians have assumed. Vorzimmer virtually ignores Wallace's criticisms of Darwin's theory of the natural selection of man. Whereas Wallace had reservations in relation to the sufficiency of natural selection in the evolution of man, Darwin had reservations in relation to the sufficiency of natural selection in general. 17 Wallace, op. cit.

Such cases as these would prove that some other law, or some other power, than natural selection had been at work. But if, further, we could see that these very modifications, though hurtful or useless at the time when they first appeared, became in the highest degree useful at a much later period, and are now essential to the full moral and intellectual development of human nature, we should then infer the action of mind, foreseeing the future and preparing for it, just as surely we do, when we see the breeder set himself to work with the deter- mination to produce a definite improvement in some cultivated plant or domestic animal. I would further remark that this inquiry is as thoroughly scientific and legitimate as that into the origin of species itself. It is an attempt to solve the inverse problem, to deduce the existence of a new power of a definite character, in order to account for facts which, according to the theory of natural selection, ought not to happen.22 The evidence he put forward for the existence of inutility in human charac- teristics was of three kinds: first, the discrepancy between the size and potential of the brain of savages and their actual requirements; second, the inutility of structural characteristics such as the lack of hair on the back and the form of the hands and feet; third, the presence of mental faculties that were of no practical value in the savage state. It is of interest that the first kind of evidence depended on the assump- tion that the 'size of brain is one of the most important elements which determine mental power or capacity'. 23 Measurements of cranial capacity showed that savage and western men varied far less in size than would be expected if brain size and mental performance were directly proportionate. This implied that the savage possesses an organ quite disproportionate to his actual requirements-an organ that seems prepared in advance, only to be fully utilised as he pro- gresses in civilisation. A brain one-half larger than that of the gorilla would ... fully had sufficed for the limited mental development of the savage ..X4 During his extensive travels in Brazil and Indonesia Wallace had collected a quantity of ethnological data which convinced him that, under peculiar circumstances, savages did exhibit those intellectual and moral attributes which characterized the highest kind of civilized man.2 5 Since these attributes were normally latent and were not useful to savages in their primitive state, it appeared to him that primitive men were equipped for the subsequent development of civilization.26 Only a teleological explana- tion of evolution could account for this apparent anticipation of future progress. Wallace did not place much weight on the second kind of evidence, except for the fact that primitive men substituted an alternative protection 2Z Wallace I89I, op. cit.

In addition to these actions, however, he distinguished a series of mental 'faculties' which had no such value. But there is another class of human faculties that do not regard our fellow- men, and which cannot, therefore, be thus accounted for [by means of natural selection]. Such are the capacity to form ideal conceptions of space and time, of eternity and infinity-the capacity for intense artistic feelings of pleasure, in form, colour, and composition, and for those abstract notions of form and number which render geometry and arithmetic possible. How were all or any of these faculties first developed, when they could have been of no possible use to man in his early stages of barbarism? How could natural selection, or survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence, at all favour the development of mental powers so entirely removed from the material necessities of savage men, and which even now, with our comparatively high civilisation, are in their farthest developments, in advance of the age, and appear to have relation rather to the future of the race than to its actual status?28 This reference to the problem of the evolution of 'human faculties' was not accidental. First, he took the faculty as his unit of analysis in psycho- logy, and, second, he presupposed a positive moral value in non-practical intellectual and artistic achievement. His argument for the insufficiency of natural selection will become clearer when these other aspects of his thought have been considered. Wallace traced the 'action of some unknown higher law'29 in the evolution of man and also in the origin of consciousness. As he commented, 'no physiologist or philosopher has yet ventured to propound an intelligible theory of how sensation may possibly be a product of organization; while many have declared the passage from matter to mind to be incon- ceivable'.3o While other biologists tended to avoid this question, Wallace believed in a spiritual purpose behind the phenomenon of consciousness. It was not clear to him that conscious actions could have any biological utility if they were merely parallel, or epiphenomenal, to automatic physiological actions. In particular, he believed that it was not possible to assign utility to the consciousness of volition if this consciousness was deceptive. If it is said, 'those changes are automatic, and are set in motion by external causes,' then one essential part of our consciousness, a certain amount of freedom in willing, is annihilated; and it is inconceivable how or why there should have arisen any consciousness or any apparent will, in such purely automatic organisms.3' 27 Ibid., pp. I94-8. 28 Ibid., p.

III In their disagreement over the sufficiency of natural selection Darwin and Wallace differed in the use or rejection of the concept of gradualism. Darwin's work on man and on the psychology of expression set out to demonstrate the continuous gradation between animal and human structural and psychological characteristics.32 He assumed that a demonstration of the similarity of characteristics entailed a demonstration of the likelihood of evolutionary connexion, and his enthusiasm for gradation sometimes led him to make crudely anthropomorphic observa- tions of animal behaviour. Wallace, on the other hand, began his discus- sion of the evolution of man with the conception of man as a new and distinct stage in the evolutionary process. This distinctness was evidenced by the mental faculties which took the selective process out of the hands of nature. Unlike Darwin, Wallace did not attempt to demonstrate, by illustrating the parallel activities of animals, the possible gradual evolution of this mental power of control.33 This reluctance to seek gradation between the stages of animal and human evolution was based on two ideas: first, the acceptance of the faculty as a unit of analysis in psychology,34 and, second, the belief that certain faculties were non-adaptive and originally appeared in latent form in primitive man. These two ideas were related in Wallace's mind by 32 Charles Darwin, The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex (London, I87I), and The expression qf the emotions in man and animals (London, I872). The second part of The descent of man, on the theory of sexual selection, accounted for the existence of animal coloration and such human attributes as the singing voice. It is probably not coincidental that Wallace rejected Darwin's theory of sexual selection. Instead, in relation to animals, Wallace developed the theory of protective coloration and recognition. He could not apply this theory to man and was therefore left without a mechanism for the evolution of those attributes which Darwin explained by means of sexual selection. See Wallace, 'Mimicry and other protective resemblances among animals', in Natural selection and tropical nature.

A record of events and opinions (London, I905), ii. I7-20, and George, op. cit. (7), pp. I83-2I8. Discussion of sexual selection and allied topics formed the major component of the Darwin-Wallace correspondence: see Marchant, op. cit. (7), i. I54-302; Darwin, op. cit. (I2), iii. 92-8, I34-8; Darwin and Seward, op. cit. (ie), ii. 84-93; unpublished letters from Wallace to Darwin in the Darwin Papers and Letters in the Cambridge University Library. For a commentary see Vorzimmer, op. cit. (Io), pp. I88-203. 33 Wallace had written that 'He is, indeed, a being apart, since he is not influenced by the great laws which irresistibly modify all other organic beings' (Wallace, op. cit. [Io], p. 182). Darwin replied 'I rather differ on the rank, under a classificatory point of view, which you assign to man; I do not think any character simply in excess ought ever to be used for the higher divi- sions' (Darwin, op. cit. [i2], iii. 90). 34 See R. M. Young, Mind, brain, and adaptation in the nineteenth century. Cerebral localization and its biological contextfrom Gall to Ferrier (Oxford, I970) pp. 44-5. The following analysis of the relation between the unitary nature of psychological faculties and Wallace's rejection of gradual- ism in the evolution of man serves, in retrospect, to link aspects of this thought. The relation was not explicitly acknowledged by Wallace.</page><page sequence="9">Alfred Russel Wall'ace: Philosophy of Nature and Man I85 his acceptance of phrenology as the fundamental psychological science. Wallace believed that the neglect of phrenology was a major failing on the part of his contemporaries.35 His enthusiasm for it began during the I840s, perhaps with his reading of George Combe's best-selling Essay on the constitution of Manz (I828) .36 Besides accepting Combe's phrenological doctrines, Wallace was probably indebted to his optimistic social theory. Wallace conducted phrenological observations of his own, had his 'head read' professionally, and became firmly convinced, by his studies, of the truth of phrenology.37 He never wavered from this view. Phrenologists supposed that the mind consisted of a series of discrete and irreducible units, each unit corresponding to a particular character or attribute. They shared with the Faculty Psychologists the belief that the mind was composed of a congeries of unitary powers. However, phre- nologists replaced the introspective methodology and philosophical interests of Faculty Psychologists with an observational methodology as well as human and biological interests.38 They argued that a unit area of the brain corresponded to each unit of the mind. The size of each brain unit was believed to be proportional to the strength of action of the particular character there located. As it was believed that the shape of the brain determined the form of the cranium, it was considered possible to assess character by observing the form of the head. The details of phrenology are not important here; it is, however, important to note the assumption that psychology deals with irreducible gross units of analysis. The units of phrenological psychology can exist only as functional wholes. Wallace could not conceive of the gradual evolution of irreducible units. In addition, certain of these units were 'developed in advance of the needs of its possessor'39 and became of value only in the development of civilization. A number of his mental faculties have no relation to his fellow-men, or to his material progress. The power of conceiving eternity and infinity, and all those purely abstract notions of form, number, and harmony, which play so large a part in the life of civilised races, are entirely outside of the world of thought of the savage, and have no influence on his individual existence or on that of this tribe . . . But, on the other hand, we find that every one of these characteristics is necessary for the full development of human nature. The rapid progress of civilisation under favourable condi- tions would not be possible, were not the organ of the mind of man prepared 35 Wallace, 'The neglect of phrenology', in The wonderful century.

Civilization depended on the action of the faculties peculiar to human nature and contrasted with, rather than gradated into, the animal world. The problem of the evolution of mind was, for Wallace, the problem of relating his belief in the teleological origin of the faculties to his belief in the evolution of the organic world by means of natural selection. His initial assumption of the existence and purpose of the human faculties was indebted to phrenology. IV Many scientists besides Wallace denied the sufficiency of natural selection as the mechanism of the evolution of various aspects of life and mind. He differed with these scientists, however, because he appeared to jump from a belief in the insufficiency of natural selection to the conclusion that a transcendental influence had directed man's evolution. He proposed that 'a superior intelligence has guided the development of man in a definite direction, and for a special purpose, just as man guides the development of many animal and vegetable forms' .4' Both his contem- poraries and recent commentators have been embarrassed by this sup- posed jump from science to transcendental teleology; but, in fact, there was no jump involved, and only a superficial examination of his thought permits demarcation between science and teleology. In the last two sec- tions I have pointed out that his criticism of the sufficiency of natural selection was based on two theoretical assumptions: the principle of utility, and the irreducibility of the units of analysis in phrenological psychology. I shall now relate these ideas to his spiritual interpretation of nature. Wallace became an enthusiastic supporter of spiritualism in the period, i860-70, during which he was forming his ideas on man's evolu- tion. 42 He accepted the evidence for hypnotism, clairvoyancy, telepathy, and the communication with spirits. He believed that the neglect of spiritualism by the scientific world was a gross example of prejudice, comparable with the neglect of phrenology. 43 Accordingly, he spent much effort attempting to make the scientific community seriously consider the evidence for spiritualism.44 In retrospect, it is clear that he was unable to 40 Wallace I89 I, op. cit.

However, this recognition of his naivety must not be allowed to obscure the fact that spiritualism was an integral part of his thinking on scientific issues and particularly on the problem of man's evolution. Once convinced of the existence of spirits, he was led to ask how far they might have been involved in the evolution of man. Having ... been led, by a strict induction from facts, to a belief-firstly, In the existence of a number of preterhuman intelligencies of various grades; and, secondly, That some of these intelligences, although usually invisible and intangible to us, can and do act on matter, and do influence our minds,-J am surely following a strictly logical and scientific course, in seeing how far this doctrine will enable us to account for some of those residual phenomena which Natural Selection alone will not explain.45 This argument is important and is not as bizarre as it might appear when it is understood in the light of his theory of the teleological determining force fundamental to the causal event. It is necessary to outline the historical background to his view of causality.46 One aspect of the British developments in phenomenalist philosophy during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was the differentiation of varieties of 'ideas'. Through the work of George Berkeley, David Hartley, Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Brown, and James Mill, it became commonplace to discuss the 'ideas' corresponding to tactile and muscular sensations. In the mid-nineteenth century the psych- ologists Alexander Bain and Herbert Spencer claimed that the 'ideas' corresponding to muscular exertion or tension were of peculiar importance.47 They contrasted the experienced quality of exertion and tension with the quality of all other sensations. Its unique quality was due to its active mode- muscular sensations occurred during the effort to support or overcome physical weight or resistance. All other sensations were supposed to exist in a passive mode-they occurred as the result of events in the physical world. Bain and Spencer believed that the muscular sensations played a fundamental role in the psychological acquisition of knowledge. In addition, they believed that the 'ideas' of activity, corresponding in the philosophical context to muscular sensations, were the fundamental and irreducible units of analysis in epistemology. They unfortunately termed the 'idea' of action 'force'; this led to confusions with contemporary developments in physics relating to the conservation and interconversion of energy. Owing to their phenomenalism and to their belief that the 'idea' of activity was irreducible, Bain and Spencer wrote as if force was 45 Wallace I875, Op. cit.

It is important to note that this substratum was characterized by activity. In laying down the most general principles of his Synthetic pAilosophy, Spencer attempted to attribute all events to the interaction of forces which resulted in an evolutionary development of complexity. Wallace was 'immensely impressed' by Spencer's First principles (I862) and probably adopted the fundamental role of force in philosophy and psychology from him.48 However, Wallace rejected Spencer's phenomenalism and considered force to be a substantial reality. He had no cogent argument for this variety of realism. The foregoing considerations lead us to the very important conclusion that matter is essentially force, and nothing but force; that matter, as popularly understood, does not exist, and is, in fact, philosophically inconceivable. When we touch matter, we only really experience sensations of resistance, implying repulsive force: and no other sense can give us such apparently solid proofs of the rea]ity of matter as touch does.49 He imagined substantial reality in terms of the dynamic expression of force or activity. Herbert Spencer enforced the idea of 'variously conditioned modes of the universal immanent force' as the cause of all material and mental pheno- mena, and as the 'Unknown Reality which underlies both Spirit and Matter'. I have here expressed the same views in a more concrete and intelligible manner. 50 This realistic view of force was indebted, via Spencer, to the contemporary emphasis on action in the psychology of muscular sensation. Furthermore, Wallace identified the experience of effort, at least in part, with the experience of free volition. As a result, he attributed the quality of volition (the free and purposive mental power to determine an effect) to the substantial reality of all phenomena, force. s' In other words, he believed that ultimately the physical and organic worlds could be interpreted as a system of voluntary powers. These powers were identified as spirits. He was not conscious of the logical confusions in his anthropo- morphic step from introspection to ontology. If, therefore, we have traced one force, however minute, to an origin in our own WILL, while we have no knowledge of any other primary cause of force, it does not seem an improbable conclusion that all force may be will-force; and thus, that the whole universe is not merely dependent on, but actually is, the WILL of higher intelligences or of one Supreme Intel- ligence. 52 This panpsychist conclusion, that reality consisted of forces guided by 48 Spencer, First principles (London, I862); Wallace 1905, Op. cit.

Both the subjective feeling of effort and spiritualist phenomena were believed to demonstrate the existence of natural events that were determined teleologically. Wallace believed that the mind possessed a faculty of volition, the action of which was known directly in the experience of effort. This belief was utilized in the defence of a theory of dynamic causality in which the cause (analogous to the faculty of volition) actively determined the effect (analogous to muscular movement). The theory of dynamic causality was held by several British scientists (including William Whewell and J. F. W. Herschel) and philosophers (including H. L. Mansel and James Martineau) in opposition to their interpretations of Hume's and J. S. Mill's analyses of causation into the constant conjunction of cause and effect.53 In every case the concept of dynamic causality was anthropo- morphically modelled on the subjective experience of effort versus resis- tance. The idea of dynamic causality was important to Wallace because it precluded any inconsistency between the mechanisms of natural selection and spiritual purpose in the evolution of man. Ultimately, he believed, all causation, including the mechanism of natural selection, was teleological. It is possible to hold to a variety of dynamic causality in which the cause is characterized by its active and necessary determination of the effect without that characterization being teleological. For Wallace, however, the substratum of activity was spiritual and hence inherently purposive. Wallace made an explicit teleological interpretation of all evolution- ary history in his last biological work, The world of life. A manifestation of creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose (i 9 Io). This book has not usually been considered relevant to his scientific work in the period I850-80, and it remains an historical problem to determine how far the teleology of the later work was present in his thought during the earlier period. Nevertheless, such a case can be made and used to give coherence to his otherwise disparate interests and statements. In The world of life he put forward a vitalist account of physiology, heredity, and embryology. He suggested that purposive forces might act in order to give rise to particular varieties in the genetic material. These varieties would then be preserved in the species through the action of natural selection. 54 Spiritual purpose therefore guided the evolution of man, directly by the origination of non-adaptive structures and faculties, 53 William Whewell, The philosophy of the inductive sciences, founded upon their history (London, i840), i.

This argument was not written down until I9IO, but in earlier discussions he pointed out the continuity of purpose and spiritual depend- ency between man's evolution and evolution in general. In Darwinism (1 889) he wrote: These three distinct stages of progress from the inorganic world of matter and motion up to man, point clearly to an unseen universe-to a world of spirit, to which the world of matter is altogether subordinate. To this spiritual world we may refer the marvellously complex forces which we know as gravitation, cohesion, chemical force, radiant force, and electricity, without which the material universe could not exist for a moment in its present form, and perhaps not at all, since without these forces, and perhaps others which may be termed atomic, it is doubtful whether matter itself could have any existence. And still more surely can we refer to it those progressive manifestations of Life in the vegetable, the animal, and man- which we may classify as unconscious, conscious, and intellectual life,- and which probably depend upon different degrees of spiritual influx. 55 Wallace's critics, notably Darwin, felt that the suggestion of spiritual control over the evolution of man implied a radical break with the theory of natural selection. 56 In reply, Wallace argued that this break was present but superficial; ultimately all laws, including the law of natural selection, were expressions of the causal activity of spiritual purpose seeking to realize the ideal of perfect man. At the same time I must confess that this theory has the disadvantage of requiring the intervention of some distinct individual intelligence, to aid in the production of what we can hardly avoid considering as the ultimate aim and outcome of all organised existence-intellectual, ever-advancing, spiritual man. It therefore implies that the great laws which govern the material universe were insufficient for his production, unless we consider (as we may fairly do) that the controlling action of such higher intelligences is a necessary part of those laws, just as the action of all surrounding organ- isms is one of the agencies in organic development. 57 He objected to the idea that his reference to spiritual purpose was an unacceptable mode of scientific explanation because it referred to a 'First Cause'. He argued for the existence of a hierachy of efficient causes grading from the material to the spiritual. In discussing the origin of man he wished to invoke spiritual efficient causes, agencies strictly to be dis- tinguished from a deus ex machina. Some of my critics seem quite to have misunderstood my meaning in this part of the argument. They have accused me of unnecessarily and unphilo- sophically appealing to 'first causes' in order to get over a difficulty ... I 5 5 Wallace I 889, op. cit.

Yet the grand law of 'continuity', the last outcome of modern science, which seems absolute throughout the realms of matter, force, and mind, so far as we can explore them, cannot surely fail to be true beyond the narrow sphere of our vision, and leave an infinite chasm between man and the Great Mind of the universe ... Now, in referring to the origin of man, and its possible determining causes, I have used the words 'some other power'-'some intelligent power'-'a superior intelligence'-'a controlling intelligence', and only in reference to the origin of universal forces and laws have I spoken of the will of 'one Supreme Intelligence'. These are the only expressions I have used in alluding to the power which I believe has acted in the case of man, and they were purposely chosen to show that I reject the hypothesis of 'first causes' for any and every special effect in the universe, except in the same sense that the action of man or of any other intelligent being is a first cause. In using such terms I wished to show plainly that I contemplated the possibility that the development of the essentially human portions of man's structure and intellect may have been determined by the directing influence of some higher intelligent beings, acting through natural and universal laws. 5 8 In Wallace's view, the various stages of evolutionary history represented the activity of a hierarchy of spirits. More orthodox scientists, by contrast, adopted the constant-conjunction view of causation and understood natural law in terms of uniform sequence. 59 Also, they understood the philosophical principle of the continuity of nature to imply that natural laws were universal. Wallace rejected the positivist leanings of orthodoxy and interpreted the principle in terms of the uniform purpose of the underlying substratum of causal action. A consideration of Wallace's philosophy of nature therefore leads to the conclusion that he saw and intended no discontinuity between general and human evolution and that it is a mistaken view to recognize such a discontinuity. Where Wallace differed from his critics was in the analysis of causality; he implied necessary and teleological connexion, analogous to the volitional mental determination of muscular effects. When he referred to man as a distinct stage in the evolutionary process, he did so in order to emphasize the stage at which purpose, continuously active in nature, became self-conscious. This view leads into his socio-political thought. V When discussing human evolution, Wallace made frequent state- ments that assumed a value-laden directionality in evolutionary history. He integrated ideas of progress and evolution and considered man as 'the head and culminating point of the grand series of organic nature'60 and 58 Ibid., pp. 205-6 note. 59 See, for example, T. H. Huxley, Hume (reprint, London, I902), pp. 20-8. 6o Wallace, op. cit. (i o), p. i 8i.</page><page sequence="16">I92 ROGER SMITH 'the ultimate aim and outcome of all organized existence'.6' This belief in the essential purposiveness of man's existence was the keystone in his teleo- logical philosophy of nature; it accounted for his view that the notion of value was a necessary element in scientific explanations. I have shown that he ultimately referred all explanations to a substratum of active spiritual purpose. The element of value in his concept of purpose was conditioned by his attitude towards social, economic, and political questions. Wallace's social thought was indebted, at least in part, to phrenology. A major reason for the popularity of George Combe's writings was their combination of a law-like analysis of human nature with a programme for the progressive realization of its potentialities through enlightened educa- tion.62 Wallace was imbued with this approach towards social problems. In his earlier writings he was guardedly optimistic about the future progress of man. This optimism was supported by his theory that social progress necessarily followed from the action of natural selection, which favoured the benevolent faculties essential to the cohesion and stability of society. If my conclusions arejust, it must inevitably follow that the higher-the more intellectual and moral-must displace the lower and more degraded races; and the power of 'natural selection', still acting on his mental organisation, must ever lead to the more perfect adaptation of man's higher faculties to the conditions of surrounding nature, and to the exigencies of the social state. While his external form will probably ever remain unchanged, except in the development of that perfect beauty which results from a healthy and well organised body, refined and ennobled by the highest intellectual faculties and sympathetic emotions, his mental constitution may continue to advance and improve, till the world is again inhabited by a single nearly homogeneous race, no individual of which will be inferior to the noblest specimens of existing humanity.63 His optimism was guarded, however, because he believed that the contemporary capitalistic exploitation of technology inhibited the natural selection of the highest moral and intellectual faculties. Instead, capitalism favoured mediocre or low moral and intellectual endeavours. Nevertheless, he believed, some progress was apparent, providing further evidence for a purpose determining man's existence. Our progress towards such a result is very slow, but it still seems to be a progress. We are just now living at an abnormal period of the world's history, owing to the marvellous developments and vast practical results of science having been given to societies too low morally and intellectually 6i Wallace I 89 I, op. cit.

Among civilised nations at the present day it does not seem possible for natural selection to act in any way, so as to secure the permanent advancement of morality and intelligence; for it is indisputably the mediocre, if not the low, both as regards morality and intelligence, who succeed best in life and multiply fastest. Yet there is undoubtedly an advance-on the whole a steady and permanent one- both in the influence on public opinion of a high morality, and in the general desire for intellectual elevation; and as I cannot impute this in any way to 'survival of the fittest', I am forced to conclude that it is due to the inherent progressive power of those glorious qualities which raise us so immeasurably above our fellow animals, and at the same time afford us the surest proof that there are other and higher existences than ourselves, from whom these qualities may have been derived, and towards whom we may be ever tending.64 The belief that Victorian capitalism opposed the 'naturally' progressive selection of man's faculties underlay all Wallace's thought on social questions. He assumed the 'natural' existence of progress because of his spiritual philosophy of nature. I shall now outline the development of Wallace's social thought, while observing that a detailed study remains to be made. This thought can be traced in his enthusiasm for a series of books on contemporary economic questions. First, the recollection of Thomas Malthus's theory of human population suggested to Wallace the idea of the survival of the fittest in animal populations. 65 Like Darwin, Wallace utilized the analogy of human society in arriving at the general theory of natural selection. Wallace was also impressed by Spencer's Social statics (i 85 I) which argued a laissez-faire view of economics in opposition to the principle of the 'artificial identity of interests' of the classical Utilitarians.66 His later social thought was in some ways a reaction against Spencer's coupling of inevitable progress with free enterprise. From the I870s social thought increasingly dominated his interests and justified Darwin's fear that he might become a 'renegade to natural history'.67 Wallace's major concern in this period was to prise apart the notions of progress and capitalism. At the end of his popular travel book, The Malay archipelago (I869), he favourably compared the state of justice, morality, and individual freedom in certain primitive societies with the 'social barbarism' of Victorian England.68 He outlined an alternative to the Victorian ideal of competitive individualism in a utopian description of individual freedom 64 Ibid., p.

He had this goal in mind when criticizing contemporary society. VVe most of us believe that we, the higher races, have progressed and are progressing. If so, there must be some state of perfection, some ultimate goal, which we may never reach, but to which all true progress must bring us nearer. What is this ideally perfect social state towards which mankind ever has been, and still is tending? Our best thinkers maintain that it is a state of individual freedom and self-government, rendered possible by the equal development and just balance of the intellectual, moral, and physical parts of our nature,-a state in which we shall each be so perfectly fitted for a social existence, by knowing what is right, and at the same time feeling an irresistible impulse to do what we know to be right, that all laws and punishments shall be unnecessary. In such a state every man would have a sufficiently well-balanced intellectual organisation to under- stand the moral law in all its details, and would require no other motive but the free impulses of his own nature to obey that law. 69 The Victorians, he believed, had falsely supposed that progress was of an economic and not a moral nature; the result was increasing misery. We should now clearly recognise the fact, that the wealth and knowledge and culture of the few do not constitute civilisation, and do not of them- selves advance us towards the 'perfect social state'. Our vast manufacturing system, our gigantic commerce, our crowded towns and cities, support and continually renew a mass of human misery and crime absolutely greater than has ever existed before.70 Wallace's humanitarian feelings caused him to measure progress in terms of the sufferings of poverty rather than in terms of the comforts of riches. Hence his social ideal was moral rather than economic; general evolution and true social progress were equally the expression of ethical value. Wallace mentioned the reform of land ownership as a prerequisite of progress; this led to a correspondence with J. S. Mill, and Wallace was invited to join the General Committee of the Land Tenure Reform Asso- ciation.7' For some time he resisted full-time involvement with the ques- tion, but in I88I he entered politics in earnest and became President of the newly-formed Land Nationalization Society.72 This interest had been strongly reinforced by his reading of the American economist Henry 69 Ibid., pp. 455-6. 70 Ibid., p. 457. 7' See the chapter entitled 'Land nationalization to socialism', in Wallace 1905, op. cit.

Rejecting the Malthusian law that misery was the natural result of a discrepancy between the birth rate and the food supply, George argued, and Wallace agreed that poverty and misery could be overcome by legislation and co-operative benevolence. In particular, they argued that laissez-faire economic development prevented genuine social progress. In I889 Wallace's commitment to social reform further developed when he read Edward Bellamy's Looking backward 2000-I887 (I888).74 He considered himself a socialist and wrote extensively to popularize his position. He defined socialism as 'the use by everyone of his faculties for the common good, and the voluntary organization of labour for the equal benefit of all'.75 This definition combined phrenology with socialism. He believed that every human being was equipped with a set of faculties, only some of which worked for the social good. It was necessary, he argued, to reform society in order to create conditions in which the better faculties, which were supposedly inhibited under capitalism, might have free expression. Wallace's socialism related to spiritualism as well as to phrenology, and he utilized spiritualism as a source of moral sanctions in personal behaviour.76 Looking back on his early intolerant attitude towards ignorance, he wrote: Later on, when the teachings of spiritualism combined with those of phrenology led me to the conclusion that there were no absolutely bad men or women, that is, none who, by a rational and sympathetic training and a social system which gave to all absolute equality of opportunity, might not become useful, contented and happy members of society, I became much more tolerant . . . I feel myself that my character has continuously improved, and that this is owing chiefly to the teaching of spiritualism, that we are in every act and thought of our lifes here building up a character which will largely determine our happiness or misery hereafter; and also, 73 Henry George, Progress and poverty.

Socialism would create those conditions which allowed for the natural selection of the higher moral and intellectual attributes, and it was this natural selection -that would create progress. When men and women are alike free to follow their best impulses ... then we shall find that a system of selection will come spontaneously into action which will steadily tend to eliminate the lower and more degraded types of man, and thus continuously raise the average standard of the race.78 If this selective process became operative, evolutionary and social history would become a continuous reflection of spiritual purpose. As he became older, Wallace was increasingly depressed by the apparently total neglect of his social ideal. He frequently passed pessimistic judgements on the incurability of social disorder and poverty under capitalism. I have done what I can to prove the utter break-down of our present state of social disorganisation-a state which causes all the advances in science and in our command over the forces of nature to be absolutely powerless to check the growth of poverty in our midst. Every attempt to salve or to hide our social ulcers has failed, and must continue to fail, because those ulcers are the necessary product of competitive individualism.79 This pessimistic tone does not appear surprising, as Wallace attempted to defend socialism, phrenology, and spiritualism in the face of orthodoxy. In spite of the unorthodoxy of his ideas, it is necessary to recognize, at a deeper level, his defence of a unified world-view that incorporated an element of value. The belief in human purpose was the starting point for both his theory of human evolution and his theory of society. Evolutionary .and social theories were therefore interdependent. VI In summary, while Wallace was the co-founder of the theory of natural selection he nevertheless rejected the sufficiency of natural selection as a mechanism for the evolution of important aspects of man's moral and mental attributes. This rejection had an internal logic: the principle of utility implied that various human characteristics, notably certain mental faculties, could not have been evolved by means of natural selection. 77 Wallace 1905, Op. cit. (32), ii. 382-3. 78 'Human selection', in Wallace I900, Op. cit. (72), i. 509-26. He described this article (first published in I890) as the 'most important contribution I have made to the science of -sociology and the cause of human progress' (Wallace I905, Op. cit. [32], ii. 209). It was also his first public commitment to socialism. Cf. 'Human progress: past and future', in Wallace I900, op. cit.

In reply, Darwin has appealed to the effects of female choice in developing these characteristics, of whicb, however, not a particle of evidence is to be found among existing savage races.8o In addition to this internal logic, the argument was dependent on two external assumptions: first, the incompatibility of the concept of gradual- ism with the units of analysis (irreducible faculties) of phrenological psychology, and, second, the belief in the moral purpose of human exis- tence. The idea of purpose had characteristics derived from the introspective experience of volition and the ideal of a benevolent society. The value- laden idea acted as a regulative principle in his thought; it determined the nature of the interdependence of his various interests. The recognition of the coherence of his thought depends on taking seriously his axiom that 'the whole purpose, the only raison d'etre of the world . . . was the development of the human spirit in association with the human body'.8' The theory of natural selection was originally designed to account for the origin of animal and plant species, but Wallace became increasingly concerned with the problem of poverty and tried to utilize his scientific theory in the service of social reform. The manner in which he did this was conditioned by his view of the teleological progress of evolutionary history. He came to believe that his theory of progress, through the natural selection of human qualities under social conditions of equal opportunity, was his major contribution to thought. In relation to his essays on 'Human selection' and 'Human progress',8z he wrote: These deal with different aspects of the same great problem-the gradual improvement of the race by natural process; and they were also written partly for the purpose of opposing the various artificial processes advocated by several English and American writers. I showed that the only method of advance for us, as for the lower animals, is in some form of natural selection, and that the only mode of natural selection that can act alike on physical, mental, and moral qualities will come into play under a social system which gives equal opportunities of culture, training, leisure, and happiness to every individual. This extension of the principle of natural selection as it acts in the animal world is, I believe, quite new, and is by far the most important of the new ideas I have given to the world.83 He regarded socialism as the 'natural' social stage or extension of a teleological evolutionary process. His teleology was ultimately grounded in a spiritualist interpretation of the supposed active substratum necessarily 8o Wallace I905, Op. Cit. (32), ii. 407-8. 8I Wallace I889, Op. cit.

As evidence for this view of causality, Wallace relied on both the phenomena of spiritualism and the quality of the subjective experience of mental effort. He was not a philosopher and these theories were therefore assumed, in order to deduce consequences for the course of human evolution and progress, rather than analysed for their logical content. I have largely ignored Wallace's important and lasting contributions to scientific theory-the theories of natural selection, geographical distribution of organisms, and protective coloration and recognition patterns. 84 These theories were formulated in response to particular empirical problems. Wallace, however, held a philosophy of nature and of scientific explanation which required his generalized theory of evolution to incorporate an anthropomorphic teleology. This teleology reflected his understanding of the purpose and effectiveness of the secularized human faculty of volition. The irreducible level of explanation in his scientific theory of evolution rested in a system of Victorian values. The vulnerability of his philosophy of nature to logical criticism is obvious and is not in question; 85 he was a naturalist and little understood the precise experimental and logical assessment of positive and negative evidence. But this does not detract from the historical interest of the connexion between social and evolutionary theory. It is generally assumed that the theory of natural selection was of importance because it eliminated final causes from biological explanations. This supposedly created the theoretical conditions necessary for the reduction of biological theory to physico-chemical theory. The case of Wallace illustrates that this is too simple an account. In addition, it is a commonplace that evolutionary theory provided the starting point for a variety of normative judgements.86 Logically speaking, this presupposed an element of value in the scientific theory itself. A wide sector of opinion, therefore, continued to accept an ultimately teleological interpretation of the evolutionary process throughout the second half of the nineteenth century.87 In the same way, Wallace believed that evolutionism added to, rather than detracted from, a belief in the moral purpose of man's exis- tence. We thus find that the Darwinian theory, even when carried ouc to its extreme logical conclusion, not only does not oppose, but lends a decided 84 See George, op. cit.

It shows us how man's body may have been developed from that of a lower animal form under the law of natural selection; but it also teaches us that we possess intellectual and moral faculties which could not have been so developed, but must have had another origin; and for this origin we can only find an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit.88 He accepted the philosophical principle of the uniformity of nature in terms of spiritual causation, in contrast to the orthodox acceptance in terms of the constant conjunction of cause and effect. It is probable that the teleological evolutionism held by Wallace, among others,89 aided the general acceptance of evolutionary views. It is certain that a teleological philosophy of nature and an evolutionary biology were not mutually exclusive. Motivated by humanitarian feelings, Wallace adopted a mental category, purposive action, as a necessary component in scientific explanations. This anthropomorphism had little cogency, but it did enable him to incorporate an element of value into the suppos edly mechanistic theory of evolution. The axiomatic position of a value-system in Wallace's philosophy of nature suggests the inappropriateness of any attempt to devise distinct 'internalist' or 'externalist' histories of evolution- ary biology. Historians are required to recognize the falsity of supposed divisions between value-free 'scientific' theories and value-laden 'non- scientific' commitments. 88 Wallace I 889, op. cit.
