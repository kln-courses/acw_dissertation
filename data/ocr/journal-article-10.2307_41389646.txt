Trees show up in my work over and over again. I think I use them so much because they are such an essential symbol. Trees represent home, shelter, the seasons, change and stability, life and endurance. They offer wood and food: fire, building material, fruit. They are beauty. They occur as religious symbols - representing the connec- tion between earth and sky, as signs of both abundance and longevity. They reflect seasonal changes clearly and dramatically. They indicate water sources and survival zones, marking oases in the desert, and tim- berline in the mountains. Although trees are much larger than we are, they sort of set the scale for us - we rest beneath them, cultivate them in orchards. Our language reflects our relationship with trees and forests. We speak of having roots, of bearing fruit, of family trees. The tree + bag pictures were taken over several years in New York. I kept noticing a particular place where the wind catches stray plastic bags and floats them up into the branches of these two small trees. After a windy day there could be four or five, or as many as a dozen, plastic bags hanging off the branches. I loved this: the beauty and ugli- ness of it. It's an odd image: cheerful and depressing at the same time. I took most of the Tree + Fence pictures during one winter in New York. These are trees that have grown around or through fences and gates. In some cases they have absorbed the metal structure and grown swollen lumps covered in bark; in other cases they've leaked out between the bars, or sometimes bent or even broken their enclosures.

"l How might the Tree + Fence series express this relationship f I thought a lot about energy while I was in Alaska. How much energy we use without thinking about where it comes from. The way I lived in Alaska, every bit was accounted for. So much wood kept me warm for so long. I had to get the wood, cut it, split it, stack it, burn it. So much of my energy was offered in exchange for the heat. Food had to be gathered (hunted, fished, picked, grown) or bought and shipped during the short season the road was open. Each item was considered, planned for, taken care of. I thought a lot about resources, particularly oil. (The pipeline is a hideous scar on an otherwise breathtakingly pure and intact wilderness. When you fly over it, it's enough to make you sick.) I also thought about water, wood, metal, and food. I got to see firsthand what mining and clear- cutting look like. I worked one summer on a farm, another summer on a commercial fishing boat. I got to see the difference between subsistence use of the land and commercial use of the same land. I also worked one summer for the Parks Service and got to see some of the problems with using the land for tourism. Urban life separates you from your sources of food and energy. Everything is piped in, or trucked in. We work for money, and use money to buy things. The relationship between our labor and our consumption gets abstracted. It's easy to loose track of precisely what it is that we are using and what the true costs really are. I used to experience a divide between social issues and envi- ronmental issues. I began to understand that environmental pro- tection is not only essential (which I'd always believed), but also profoundly connected to human rights. The social issues that had affected my life so directly in New York City - healthcare, gay rights, women's rights, AIDS - were paralleled here. Although the specifics in Alaska (hunting regulations, oil, Native American rights, mining, land allocations) were different, the problems were the same. I came to see them as different parts of the same beast. I just think big business is incompatible with a healthy society. Capi- talism will always override any model of sustainable consumption: a system whose objective is to make the GNP grow every year will always encourage us to consume too much. A system based on profit - where the goal of each person, corporation, or country is to amass the most property they possibly can - will never co-exist with the concept of sharing equally.</page><page sequence="8">Spring 2002 77 In Alaska, I learned a little more about the possibilities of sub- sistence economies, such as hunting, fishing, and gardening. Sus- tainable resource use. Take what you need. Leave the rest. Give back what you can. To get back to the heart of your question, I'm not sure what any of this has to do with my work. It's rare that my work addresses a spe- cific issue directly. I've never considered myself a political artist in that way. It's more that I think my worldview seeps into my work. The work is steeped in it. 3) You were working on your Hunting and your Tree + Fence series at about the same time. How did these two projects relate far y ou ? How might "nature" be represented in different - or similar - ways through these two senes ? I think both the Hunting pictures and the Tree + Fence pictures are really about us. Not so much about nature as an entity separate from us, but more about who we are and how we behave in nature. I think the Tree + Fence photographs illustrate this curious per- ception of a divide between nature and culture. They demonstrate our bizarre relationship to other living things - this impulse to con- tain them or use them, but to keep us separate from them. It's so funny that we talk about bad or crazy people as being "animals," or that we glorify "civilization" as better, or more advanced, than "nature." At the same time, these pictures illustrate our attachment to trees: we continue to incorporate them into our cities; we like to live near them. In the tree + bag pictures, we see trees which were planted in front of a building on Avenue A. Here they are now, cov- ered in our garbage. They look sort of decorated, like Christmas trees, but also disgraced, disrespected, standing there covered in plastic bags. Yet there are people sitting on the benches beneath them, chatting, going on about their lives. The Hunting pictures are also open to interpretation. People have told me they find these pictures to be about brutality, cruelty. That's not what these images are, for me. While I am very much against sport hunting and trophy hunting, I am very much in support of subsistence hunting. For me there is a real difference in violence for survival (i.e. killing an animal to eat it) , and violence that is in the pursuit of power or profit. I truly believe that hunting, gathering, and gardening are the basis of a healthy, sustainable human lifestyle. This approach is much healthier and more sustainable than mass "pro- duction" of cows, chickens, and milk, or even large-scale production of wheat, soybeans, etc. I think we need to accept that when we eat something - anything - we've killed it. There should be no guilt. There should be acceptance, respect, honor. If you understand your-</page><page sequence="9">78 Discourse 24:2 self as part of the cycle, you don't take more than you need. You thank the powers that be for your good fortune to be alive and survive. I had very mixed feelings about killing an animal. I never thought I could do it. But I strongly felt that if I wasn't willing to go through that process, then I had no right to eat meat. In contemporary society, our choices about what we consume are so complex . . . even organic, vegetarian, vegan products come to us packaged, wrapped, shipped, advertised. They are all tied into a pretty problematic system. (This applies to our clothes and shoes, our electric lights, computers, flush toilets, etc.) This is perhaps too big a conversation for right now, but my basic attitude is to under- stand that I am always consuming - air, water, food - and I try to consume responsibly and respectfully. 4) When you returned to NYC from Alaska , you said that the tree out- side of your window u attracted [your] attention in a whole new way. " 2 You ve " known " that tree for about 1 8 years. Can you describe your "new way " of seeing that tree ? I watched that tree for years. When I first moved into that apart- ment, I was 17. The tree was a sapling coming up behind the fence. Over the 20-odd years I lived there, I watched the tree grow up and around that fence, engulfing part of it, and continuing to grow to its full height. I was always fascinated, found it so poignant. I came to love that tree. Finally, one day, I started taking pictures. I began to notice these trees all over the city. I think I was moved by their survival; by their ability to adapt, to find a way to keep growing. For me, these images are anthropomorphic. We all encounter obstacles, we all have a desire to grow outside the limits imposed on us. I like it that these photographs are open-ended. They are cer- tainly images of containment and pain, but they are also images of flexibility and persistence. Ultimately, I think they are images of struggle. And struggling, it seems, is just an essential part of living. 5 ) Many of your trees might be considered composite creatures : part fence , part tree , sometimes bearing bags or other urban detritus. What was the importance of creating a composite tree? I've made a few sculptures of trees. The first two were small: 9-12 feet tall, they were made of various limbs and branches patched together to make a composite tree. That first tree was really more about the leaves - the tree was more of an armature to hang the leaves from. I gathered leaves through two autumns in Alaska, and later in New York and Europe. I boiled the leaves in wax to pre- serve their color and give them some durability, and attached them to the branches with clothespins. This first piece was called Tree with</page><page sequence="10">Spring 2002 79 Leaves. I think this piece was about time and desire, about wanting to hang onto something past its time. That sculpture doesn't exist anymore. I took it apart and much later reused some of those materials to make a much sparer piece: Tree without Leaves (2000) . I still have all the leaves stored in my stu- dio, waiting to be used in some other piece. Tree , the sculpture I installed for the Vienna Secession (July, 1997), was a reconstruction of a single tree. As was the piece I showed at Paula Cooper Gallery. In each case, I took down a whole tree, cut it into pieces that I could lift and carry, and partially recon- structed the tree in the space, using metal plates, bolts, and wire. One of the themes I work with over and over again is the idea of reconstructed experience: memory, our desire to remember, and the changeable quality of our memories. We constantly reconstruct images of the past in order to create our present identity. I'm inter- ested in the fissures in this reconstruction . . . the clumsiness, the seams and breaks. Both of these pieces for me had a lot to do with displacement, fam- ily, destruction, and repair. The tree I reconstructed at Paula Cooper Gallery was sort of like a tree in traction after a horrible accident. I think of it in a way as my family tree, or as the Frankenstein tree. 6) The fences which you include in your photographs might be seen as a kind of border ( the edge of a property , a "do not trespass " limit, etc.). How do borders figure in your work ? I'm always interested in the border of the photograph itself. When I print, I always leave in the black border. I want to show that there is a frame; that every photograph is an edited, subjective image. 7) In one of your interviews , Anna Blume describes your art as work- ing to " animate the inanimate" or to create "a conversation with silent objects. "3 Can you talk a bit more about this impulsei I'm interested in the power objects hold for us. We rely on them to represent our ideas, philosophies, beliefs, and memories. You see this in our relationship to religious objects and relics or souvenirs and snapshots, or even physical evidence presented at trial. They are not the idea, place, person, or action itself, but a representative of it. Proof of it. Art objects tap into this essential relationship. We have an innate need and ability to look at, and look for, symbols. They give us a way to focus. I think this is why I work with both photography and sculpture. In both mediums, my practice is remarkably similar. In both cases I work with found objects and found images, things I notice. Either I take a picture or I collect the objects and arrange them: re-pres- ent them, re-frame them.</page><page sequence="11">80 Discourse 24:2 Sometimes, I see an image or find an object that seems to have a story, like the stories of the trees and their fences. By photo- graphing it, or placing it clearly and carefully in a new context, I try to find a way to let that story become visible. In this way I think my work is less about creating and more about observing. This may seem completely contradictory, but what I talked about with Anna [Blume] is this desire to give life to something, to fill it with meaning. As an artist I try to invest my work with mean- ing. I keep working on the scale, or placement, or print quality until the piece seems to embody its own idea, so that the intention and the material become inseparable. I want the work to be able to speak on its own - so the story is there, in the piece itself. Again, here I think of Dr. Frankenstein. It strikes me that we usually think of Frankenstein as the monster, while in the story he is the creator. He wants to piece together a new being. 8) If your Tree + Fence series raises questions around " nature " and "culture, "how does your installation of dolls (Mouth Open, Teeth Show- ing of 2000) intersect with these terms ? I had two images in my head that were sort of itching me: I'd been thinking about the buried terracotta army at Xian (China). I've always found those images so strange and beautiful; I also had some filthy, messed up dolls I'd bought at a flea market. One morn- ing I woke up knowing these things belonged together. I wanted to make an army of dolls. I wanted to force these two polarities together in one piece. I wanted to put the dolls - passive, feminized, idealized representations of children - into the stance and structure of an army - rigid, organized, and aggressive. I used all female dolls. As I acquired them I noticed the differ- ent body types: infant, toddler, adolescent, woman. I noticed the proportion of blond to brunette, of white to black or brown or Asian. And I noticed the different "personalities": cheerful, wistful, happy, funny, shy. The dolls provided a kind of catalog of female imaging over the last century. Each doll was conceived of, designed, manufactured in order to represent a certain ideal girl or woman and to capture a certain market (in the early 1980s, for example, you start to see a lot more brown dolls). It's so interesting to me that these are objects we give to our chil- dren. These are teaching tools as much as play things. Most of the dolls I used were second-hand, so they bore the marks of the chil- dren who played with them: choppy haircuts, chewed-up feet, pen and crayon marks, missing limbs, torn clothes. When I began setting the dolls up in formation, their stance (upright, feet flat on the floor, one foot and one hand slightly for- ward to imply forward motion) changed the way their "expressions"</page><page sequence="12">Spňng 2002 81 are read. To me they became alternatively scary, funny, pathetic, and resolute. As I worked with placement, alternating types, the dis- tinctions grew subtler. This one seems withdrawn, that one outgo- ing, the other simply insane. The room was dense, complex, but I think the piece remained open ended. I think as one begins to project, to anthropomorphize, myriad meanings arise because of all our associations with dolls: our childhood memories, as well as our adult experiences with children. Looking at the dolls, one can think about gender or child abuse, about memory, or politics, feminism, or psychology. The scale and placement of the installation were key - that you not only see it, but you walk through it. You experience it from many vantage points. And you feel the scale of your body in relation to the dolls. Somewhere, about a year into making the piece, I finally saw how personal this piece is, how much it is about childhood. My own experiences of childhood, as well as my experience now of no longer being a child. It was a way to look back and see how the girl- child is vulnerable, ignorant, powerless, and yet resilient all at the same time. I think a lot of my work has to do with this resilience. The fence is there, but the tree grows. The limbs are missing and the clothes are torn, but the doll stands. 9) The title of your installation piece Strange Fruit (1992-97) refers to a Billie Holliday song about lynching : Southern trees bear a strange fruit . . . strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees . . . Pastoral scene of the gallant South . . . Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck , Far the rain to gather, for the wind to suck , For the sun to rot , for trees to drop, Here is a strange and bitter crop.4 I can't help but wonder if your photographs of urban tree-scapes also depict some "strange fruit. " Would any of these words relate to the stray 'fruit" which is found in your Tree + Fence senesi How would you describe the strange fruit that these urban trees yield? I'm interested in power dynamics. I'm interested in how human beings are willing to mangle each other, and the world around them, in order to achieve supremacy, and in this impulse to domi- nate, subjugate, and profit form the world around us. I'm puzzled by this central force of human behavior. Violence is easier for me to understand when it's necessary for immediate survival - in subsistence hunting, or when we are resisting domina- tion - and fighting back. It seems a pity, a waste, that in the blind rush</page><page sequence="13">82 Discourse 24:2 (Detail) Strange Fruit (for David), 1992-97. 295 banana, orange, grapefruit, lemon and avocado peels, thread, zippers, buttons, sinew, needles, plastic, wire, stickers, fabric, and trim wax. Dimensions variable. Collection: Philadelphia Museum of Art. to dominate the world we destroy each other, we destroy the planet. We miss the opportunities for beauty and harmony that are here, waiting. I'm not saying that nature is Utopian. Nature is not peaceful, or idyllic, or safe. There is a food chain, and in the past we were not at the top of it. Without weapons, we still wouldn't be. There are inflexible rules of survival in nature: speed, strength, size, and intel- ligence. But overall there seems to be a logic, a sustainable system of species interaction. What seems bizarre in human behavior is that we are destroying the very elements we need to survive: air, water, land, food, species diversity. The irony here is that our need to dom- inate - which looks at first like survival of the fittest - ends up being self-destructive, if not actually suicidal. I think we are seeing all of this so clearly, so tragically, illustrated in the war in Afghanistan. I think we see here the connectedness we talked about earlier. It is a resource war. Ultimately it's a war about</page><page sequence="14">Spring 2002 83 who gets to control that part of the world. And it's the result of so many decades of exploitation, so many decades of wrong moves. 10) You've described the influence your visit to India has had on your work. "I had just come back from India and was impressed with how each scrap of paper, each bit of wire was used to its maximum , to the very end of its possible useful life . . . " 5 This sense of "maximum use" seems to have been an important aspect of Native American cultures as well , as an expres- sion of respect for the earth 5 resources. Can you describe your interest in con- servation and its many meanings to you? How might this practice - of using something to its maximum - relate to rituals of mourning f I think it shows most in Strange Fruit. For me, preserving the object is like preserving the experience, the memory, or the set of associa- tions. Strange Fruit deals with the conflict between hanging on and let- ting go. Which in a way is what mourning is. The conflict in that piece is that every scrap is saved, painstakingly mended, but since the peels themselves are not preserved, they continue to decay. Over time, they shrivel, fade. The piece itself is slowly disintegrating. Much of my work involves collections of older, used objects. I'm interested in the marks we leave, the signs of our use. I'm interested in the things we make and the things we leave behind. Like arche- ological findings, I think our detritus tells an awful lot about us. Much of my work also deals in a way with history, with recollec- tion. With re-collecting the world in order to examine and under- stand it. 11) You 've described the importance of time in many of your pieces. You've also said that conservation and recycling resulted in a certain " rhythm " to your life.6 Can you tell us how time (or rhythm) is depicted in your series ? Much of my work deals with time, with the passage of time and the inevitability of change. Strange Fruit certainly did. Of the more recent work, I think the tree + bag pictures are perhaps most con- cerned with time and rhythm. I used to walk past a place almost everyday, for years. It's a sen- ior citizens home, actually. The building is set back from the street and there are a couple of trees and some benches. It's a place to sit outside and pass the time. One day, several years ago, I noticed some plastic bags hanging from the tree. I thought it was such a curious image. I took a picture. I found myself noticing that this happened often in this one particular spot. For some reason, there's a kind of wind tunnel there. The wind catches garbage and stray plastic bags and they float up on the air current and get caught in the branches. After a windy day, there could sometimes be a lot of bags up in the trees.</page><page sequence="15">84 Discourse 24:2 At the time I was pretty much concentrating on the Tree + Fence pictures, but something about this image stayed with me. I started looking for plastic bags up in the trees, taking pictures whenever I found one. I liked it that there is a kind of humbleness, a casual- ness. The pictures are so completely undramatic, so completely everyday. There is a kind of sweet, surprising beauty here. Some- thing I had walked past for years without noticing. The following winter, I made a four-part photo piece. I used a series of four photographs as a play on the four seasons. Even though in all four pictures it's winter. The pictures all depict the same place. I came by regularly, early in the morning, or on gray days when the light was soft. So the pictures are all kind of the same. They are all tones of gray: brownish brick, dark green benches, cement walkway, chain link fence, and trees bare of leaves. The only thing that really changes is the bags. The passage of time is revealed through the changing assortment of bags. Sometimes there are only a few bags, sometimes there are many. Most of the bags are black or white, but sometimes there is a bright color or logo. Some are shredded, and others are ballooned out with air. I liked it that the images were kind of delicate, kind of tentative. There is a sense of the role chance plays, and a sense of the temporality and fragility of life. 12) Your Tree + Fence series was taken with an old Leica. While it is an older technology , it was a new technique for you. This transition made you more attuned to your own procedures f you ■ ve said. How would you describe the effects of this new /old technology ? Using a new camera helped me to get out of my own habits and look again. Having to fumble with a different light meter, a differ- ent focusing apparatus, made me consider the way I compose a pic- ture. How I edit the world. Also it made it new for me again. Exciting. After about 20 years of shooting black and white I've been shooting color. I love it that I still have so much to learn. I love how much this medium still requires of me. After all this time, I'm still asking: what makes a good picture? Or even: what makes a picture? 13) Your early photographs of water have been likened to skin , to the body ? How would you say that constructs of "Nature" and uthe Body " are related in your work ? I just love the ocean. I think perhaps we all do. It's just the most beautiful, most primal element to me. The surface of it, and the mystery of what is beneath: the depths, the lives, the animals who live below the surface, the rich diversity below. I am always amazed and inspired by how much life there is below the surface . . . and how little we know of it. We share a planet, but there is a complete</page><page sequence="16">Spring 2002 85 and complex world beneath that I'll never really know. I love the skin of the ocean because it's the border between two elements: air and water. Perhaps I'm also drawn to its opacity - it is a window through which we can't quite see. I think I often photograph what I don't understand, or what I want to understand. I photograph in an effort to understand. 14) For a period you were photographing maps. Can you talk a bit about this project? How might it relate to your interest in constructions of "nature" and " culture "? Maps reveal how we move around in and conceive of the world. Maps are so subjective. They can show political borders, topo- graphical features, water sources. They reveal as much about the cartographer, as about the place. They can also be sentimental objects, memories of places we visit, streets we walk. I think my early work was grasping towards all that: how we each interpret the world, and how I reveal my own particular perspective.
