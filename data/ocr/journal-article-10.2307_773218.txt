<plain_text><page sequence="1">Towards a Methodology in Art History By Clifford Amyx T HE recent publication of "The Science of Art History" by Samuel Cauman (C.A.J., IV, 1)1 was a continuation of the attempt to point out the conditions which must precede the elimina- tion of an appeal to a Zeitgeist or a daimon in the foundation of a methodology in art history. In passing, Cauman indicates that art history, as a method, has only now reached a position corresponding to the progress made in psychology at the time of Wundt. In a reply to a position put forward by Dr. Joachim Weyl, who indicated that art, in its search for reality, is at a stage roughly comparable to the work of Galileo in the physical sciences (C.A.J., II, 2), I indicated that there was a negative criterion of contemporaneity which should not be disregarded in the pursuit of the Zeitgeist (C.A.J., III, i). Now, as then, I am filled with amazement at the self-castigation of art historians who derive from extra-artistic sources the basis of their discomfiture. If it is true that art is at a level comparable to Galileo, and art history at a level comparable to Wundt, what then is the explanation of the continued absence of a reasonable degree of progress in the study of the arts, and why is there a failure of achieve- ment comparable to that in other fields of endeavor? A part of this may be due, of course, to the problem of evaluation, and the constant mutation of taste. But where we have acquired a sufficient psychic distance to determine that any style has mistaken its own function, any field of endeavor its own method, and any culture the objective basis of its own art, then we should become truly concerned. If.I am not mistaken this is what is being said by these two writers on art who seem to hope that art might approach science in method, and perhaps in content. The notion that the artist is possessed by a daimon, that he is an oracle serving purposes other than those which are evidently his own, is common to many cultures. The notion of a Zeitgeist, or a common compulsion, acting on or through the artist, has seemed only too nebulous as the foundation upon which the relation of one art to another, or of art to the other efforts of man can be grounded. It may seem of negligible import to point out that persons living in 1 Cf. comments on this article by J. Alford and S. Pepper in C.A.J., V, 3 (March, 1946)-Ed. 312</page><page sequence="2">TOWARDS A METHODOLOGY IN ART HISTORY 313 the same culture area, if we accept only the anthropologist's evidences of culture, produce things which are "like"; but I believe that this is exactly what is needed, plus a cogent explanation of the manner in which things may be assumed to be like in art, and whether we may assume a Zeitgeist from them. It is not the purpose of methodology in art history to set up norms for the guidance of future production in art, or present production. In this sense art history, like other history, can offer little of im- mediate practical import from its pursuit. Neither is it the purpose of art history to clarify the purposes of man, but to determine the relative validity of the forms which man uses to embody his purposes. It is evidently Cauman's belief that, as the science of art history progresses, we may hope to "strip the mystery from even the highest level of human experience" (op. cit., p. 32). There is implicit in his writing the notion that present methodology in art history is a compound of science and magic, the science of which is derived from normal methods of research, dependent on the tools which have been developed in common with other research procedures, and the magic of which is principally a brew of the search for beauty, left us as a philosophic hangover. There is support for such a position in the writing of contemporary historians. Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., in his article on the St. Francis Series at Assisi, notes his own purposes as ". . . in part a diagnosis of a malady very prevalent among self- styled art historians, who are not historians at all, but a very interesting sort of wishful. thinkers....2 These "wishful thinkers" I take to be the critics and connoisseurs (since we are forbidden to call them historians) who proceed by deductive methods from their own premises to their own conclusions, a branch of reasoning not specially confined to the arts, but perhaps more carefully cultivated there. In any case Mather is ready to proceed on the assumption that "first things first" means proof by historical evidence which would convince a person not learned in the arts. If art history is now ready for a firmer grounding in the dual function of the discovery of art objects and the discovery of art form, we must heed the warning of Venturi against the excesses of the various "branches" of the profession.3 The humanist has an exces- sive concern with iconology, the scientific historian tends to spend his time in documenting, and the historians of taste tend to study 2 "Giotto's St. Francis Series at Assisi Historically Considered," Art Bulletin, XXV, 2, 1943- 'Art Criticism Now, 1941.</page><page sequence="3">314 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL visual modes which are excessively abstract. Venturi is less harsh with the latter practice since it approaches very closely his own special concern that history and criticism should deal with "form," or simply "art." Venturi's role of Socratic gadfly to the profession is not to be denied its value, and writers of art history should never tire of reminding themselves that a work of art is always a living thing. The point is well taken that art history is not documentation, not iconology, not affective response, but that its methodology must grow out of all three of these areas, none of which can be neglected, none of which must overburden the others. As I have indicated earlier, the stigma which attaches to any except obviously empirical procedures in research into art history makes it necessary to posit explicitly the conditions which govern method, and which may be presumed to indicate how we are to rid ourselves of the "magical" or "daemonic" element growing out of a definition of beauty. It is my conception that this will not necessarily mean the voiding of philosophical inquiry since no discussion of the fundamental problems in any area of endeavor is other than philosophic. The lowest common denominator in our search for a synthesis of the data in art is always the seeking for a common quality. We cannot proceed at this point without some indication of the possible areas in which we may hope to find such a common quality, and this will inevitably involve a consideration of certain genera of qualities which form the object of inquiry as it has been conceived in traditional esthetics. It is not difficult to accept the notion that out of the conative- associative states induced by the work of art, common qualities may be discovered. There is a certain uniformity of response to the work of art, though hardly with the regularity and precision of a chemical action-and this is a significant fact about art. We have learned through contemporary investigations into the basis of affective response that such responses are largely conditioned and learned, and that a raw affective response is as truly fictional as a "faculty" of the mind. The determinants of the affective response have been summed up under the concept "attitude," and this is broad enough to include several categories ranging from the purely analytic and cognitive to the merely habitual.4 The broadly cultural determinants of the affective response, " H. N. Peters, "The Experimental Study of Aesthetic Judgments," Psychologi- cal Bulletin, 39, 2.</page><page sequence="4">TOWARDS A METHODOLOGY IN ART HISTORY 315 though only recently admitted to the psychology of art, have long been operative in the work of the artist. The fact that psychology has only the crudest approaches to these broader cultural determi- nants, and that the work of art has been approached with the inten- tion to abstract from it the purely atomist affective state, such as might be categorized under P or U, pleasant or unpleasant, means only that psychology has been of no help in determining common quality which might be of aid in predicting a common compulsion. The school methods of testing abilities and appreciations have only recently seen fit to treat the work of art as a whole, an indication that might have been gained from Gestalt, thus breaking with the tradition of empirical esthetics as founded by Weber and Fechner. The indication here is that, though the affective basis may be the utilitarian determinant in the preservation of works of art, the re- sponse on the basis of affection is too crude to be of help in the search for common quality. The crude tools of "I like" and "I dislike" indicate no real key to a typus of common quality, and the history of taste is more than the history of affection. Another basis on which common quality is posited is that of con- tent. If we accept tentatively the theory that the content of a work of art is the "expressed content" and not the "subject matter," we are again on rather tenuous grounds for seeking a common quality. A typology of content in terms of universals has been worked out by Greene.5 He indicates that the ultimate considerations in con- tent may be moral. Panofsky gives us a theory of iconographic interpretation of works of art,6 unfortunately without the clarity of statement in regard to assumption which attends Greene's exposi- tion. Panofsky's equivalence of the object of interpretation with two types of subject matter (primary or natural and secondary or conventional) and "intrinsic" meaning may serve well enough as an empirical guide in induction from works of art but it is difficult to believe that he has grounded himself philosophically. It is suffi- cient to note here that he falls into the evident error of tabling his "subject matter" and "object of interpretation" under the same column, thus making the object and the subject matter at this point equally valid as the area of "interpretation." This version of the traditionally semi-literary role of iconographic analysis has been censured by Venturi as the excess of humanist iconology in inter- preting the work of art. 5 The Arts and the Art Criticism, 1940. 6 Studies in Iconology, 1939-</page><page sequence="5">316 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL Panofsky's table of iconographic method, and his discussion of the method, serve admirably to point out certain problems in his- tory and criticism of the work of art. Though his Introduction (op. cit., p. 3) treats of the problems of iconography, the title of his work is Iconology. If we may assume that these two terms are related as method and as science, then there is no immediate quarrel with such a usage, and the method of iconography may inform the science of iconology. However, in the definition of iconography as "... that branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to their form," there is not only a readiness to equate subject matter and meaning, which is contrary to most current thinking on the role of the iconic sign, but there is a suppression of the root graphein in the literal meaning of iconography. The means, literally the graphic means, which the artist finds necessary to his expression and his designation are neg- lected, in theory, in Panofsky's definition of method in art history. There is, of course, no question concerning the importance of the icon, the sign as designating, since even the formalist criticism of the last few decades, founded in the growth of modern abstract art, has in most cases failed to account for the iconic quality of the traditional work in any satisfactory manner. The iconic quality of the work of art, though it may be incidental to the expressed con- tent, cannot be ignored entirely. The icon cannot be defined away, as Roger Fry finally came to allow. In a similar manner an integral theory of art cannot allow a negligence of the medial-formal deter- minants of common quality, and the term iconography must stand on two major roots of its meaning. Since Panofsky's definition is somewhat in accord with traditional usage there can be no hurried correction of these difficulties, but as long as his principal epistemic tool is "insight," and especially insight into "essential tendency" (op. cit., p. 15) the daimon is readmitted, and the Zeitgeist is readmitted, and we shall have little rest. Greene has had much more success in the definition of a typol- ogy of universals, especially in painting, but he has not proposed a methodology in induction from works of art which is readily adaptable to ordinary practice. We must return therefore to the notion that the formal or generic- formal modes are the proper area in which a science of art history may be grounded. Analogy is often called reasoning by resemblance. It is inductive,</page><page sequence="6">TOWARDS A METHODOLOGY IN ART HISTORY 317 positing a sufficient number of points of similarity upon which the judgement is made that the rest of the data will correspond. Intui- tive induction is simply the process of judging rapidly from a limited number of points, accompanied by a felt conviction of the certainty of the judgement. When we make a hurried estimate of a painting we are making a comparison with the generic qualities which we have already determined as of this master or this school; or, on the basis of limited data, we may compare a very few points with a few similar points in some other single work, in the effort to establish generic quality. The purpose may be either attribution or evalua- tion, and the normal procedure is to establish attribution wherever possible on documentary evidence, and later adjudge the evidence in terms of quality. The induction may be made with a felt con- viction from a low level of artistic data, or even from non-artistic data. Induction in many sciences, and surely in medicine, is based on analogy of situation in which no complete range of quality is given. Thus in illness the physician adjudges the future course of the disease on the basis of evidences of similarity with the early stages which are characteristic of this disease. But in the work of art the analog is among complete terms (except in cases of restoration) and, being among complete terms with a full range of quality, approaches a greater degree of certainty than art is normally accorded. It should be recognized that the mutation of taste, with the resultant change in evaluation, does not discredit this type of synthesis. Thus Reinach, though he did not admire the Baroque, had no difficulty in pointing to it. It is true that if he had thoroughly understood its character in terms of the formal distinctions between the Baroque and Renais- sance, he might have been less inclined to treat the former in terms of a "degenerescence." Induction from artistic terms, even at a low level of artistic syn- thesis, is different from documentation, and is a type of induction using a different order of data. The attribution of a painting to Rubens, based on an estimate of the presence of the hand of the master as against the tighter elements which might indicate Snyders or Breughel, is different from attribution on evidence of non- artistic data. It cannot be overstressed that when we proceed from artistic premises in induction from works of art we do not, as Mather seems to maintain, leave reason behind and proceed by whim or fancy. Indeed, it must be argued that artistic induction is prior,</page><page sequence="7">P38 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL in matters of art, to any other type of induction. Failing the validity of this contention, we have no title to historian of art, but title only to historian of objects. Certainly we cannot fail to attempt the larger synthesis since the work of art is anthropomorphic in the larger sense, and even on these meagre grounds an aid to history. If we do not gain the highest levels of experience in art, then we preserve nothing vital from the past. The contingency of future re-evaluation is always with us, for our data may not be complete, but for each age to refuse the task is to admit its own lack of confidence in its method, and even its ultimate concepts of value. The inductive basis of the discovery of generic form is pointed out by Greene when he notes that "Intramedial generic forms cannot be arrived at by a priori deductive inference; they can be discovered only by a method of artistic induction" (op. cit., p. 144). The point at issue is the exact relation which obtains between "artistic induc- tion" and other types of induction, or whether there may be induc- tion from works of art which differs essentially from other types of induction. Of course, induction is neither artistic nor non-artistic in the strict sense of the word, it is only logical, and therefore cor- rect or incorrect. What is intended here is that the concept of artistic induction, which should govern procedure in art history and criti- cism, arises from terms which are in themselves works of art, and until a part of their merit as art is determined induction is proceed- ing on other than artistic premises. Out of his knowledge of the works of art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Wdlfflin constructed the highest generic quali- ties of Renaissance and Baroque art.' If we accept as adequate his formulation of the principles of opposition which define the two styles (from which we cannot dissociate the notion of temporal existence) we see that in each instance the particularization, through an object of art, is in the specific relation to the generic qualities which are the total conception of "Baroque." Thus the adjective "painterly," exhaustive of one particular characteristic of the Baroque as exemplified in San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane, View of Toledo, and The Ecstasy of St. Teresa, actually characterizes these particular works. Langer's definition of a concept as "that which all adequate conceptions have in common" fits very well here, since the conception is the embodiment (in some medium) of a 7Principles of Art History, 1932.</page><page sequence="8">TOWARDS A METHODOLOGY IN ART HISTORY 319 concept.8 Thus we have the notion of generic form (which may be said to be the concept) and the particular form which embodies the concept. The manner in which such generic concepts are developed should be carefully examined. The point that Venturi makes in his criticism of the "excessively abstract" modes of vision which characterize such a methodology of opposition as practiced by W1lfflin, is that they are abstract modes: i.e., they are concepts. By implication in the title, Principles of Art History, W1lfflin extends the methodology of opposition to all art history, and insofar as Western art is adequately defined in the major modes of Renaissance and Baroque, from which later painting derives its main character, these principles are valid. Greene adopts the manner of treatment, linear, as an example in painting, but he is careful to point out that the vitality of such a manner is stylistic. To posit linear of Botticelli and of Ingres is indeed to be excessively abstract, but with the criterion of con- temporaneity to guide us, we may profitably examine Delacroix and Ingres in terms of the W61fflin oppositions. The fact that Wo1fflin derived his concepts in opposition induc- tively out of his knowledge of great art at the beginning of our culture preserves them from the flaw of abstraction in their own context, and makes them useful, when used correctly, in the de- termination of the traditional content in modern painting. In a like manner, they might be useful in the determination of the possible break of modern painting with such a tradition. Insofar as the Renaissance and Baroque are valid prototypes of Western art their principles can be extended to the art of our day, but as nouns they cannot be extended to Oriental art on the penalty of excessive abstraction. The distance from the lowest common denominator of common quality, which may involve an estimate of the medial usage of an artist, his impasto, his color syntax, his compositional pattern, through the higher levels of abstraction involving school character- istics in ideography or other more immediately generic patterns, offers a very wide and ill-defined path for the historian and critic. Loss of the proper level of abstraction is a much more serious affair than an improper attribution in many cases. The confusion of the hand of Giulio Romano with that of Raphael is serious, and it is of value to have the records straight as to the respective work of 8 Philosophy in a New Key, 1942.</page><page sequence="9">320o COLLEGE ART JOURNAL these men, but a proper level of abstraction should keep the problem in perspective. In no area of human endeavor can we refuse to make an evalua- tion of the data according to some systematic method. That there is a mutation of the data of art history in more than one dimension has induced a consternation into the historian of art. As a matter of fact the organic character of history lends a security to the data of art which puts them on a more comparable footing with the sciences than they enjoy in their own time. History will evaluate science somewhat (since science pretends to be neutral as to value in its own day) and to a certain degree will devaluate art through a compression of the widest range of affective response. The process by which works of art assume cogency in the mutation through history may be considered as a centering on the formal characteristics as apart from immediate utilitarian or designatory purposes. Thus Mrs. Siddons, as a portrait, has lost some of the quality which was evident to the contemporaries of Mrs. Siddons and Sir Joshua. The detail which this work bore at that time has been lost through history and certain other larger qualities stand out. Sir Joshua was a painter in the "grand style" and the qualities in the picture which enter into the valid documentation of the grand style are more evident than they were in their own day. One determinant of the vitality of a work is time; a picture which exists outside its own context often assumes a museum pallor. When I posited the notion of contemporaneity (C.A.J., III, 1) it was only as a negative criterion to prevent an equivalent of anachronism. Thus there can be no valid norm for considering the work of Cezanne and the work of Galileo as referring to the same "reality" unless we make clear the exact measure of the temporal distance. It may be said that the larger the temporal distance the higher the generic quality which is necessary to subsume the data. We may determine that Galileo and Cezanne are of the same culture if an exact account of the inter-medial forms are given, and an exact account of the relation set up through temporal distance. Thus far we have been talking only of the visual arts, the arts of space: painting, sculpture, and architecture. When we transgress the medial bounds of any of these three we create no special prob- lems in generic form, since they are all derived out of space by the articulation of form in light. The quality malerisch may be truly predicated of the work of Bernini, of Rubens, of Borromini, though the works are in different media. The basic plastic elements are</page><page sequence="10">TOWARDS A METHODOLOGY IN ART HISTORY 321 common to all and their articulation is readily seen as a manner of treatment. While the arts of space are revealed to the eye, the arts of time are revealed to the ear as articulations in sound. When we begin to search for common quality among the several major arts, we are tempted to turn immediately to the affective correlate or the content correlate, but we must examine the possible grounds out of which a formal kinship may be constructed. If the articulation of form in one basic medium, space, implies a subdominant form in the other basic medium, time, then some nexus will have been estab- lished for the relation of the arts of space to time, and vice versa. The mind apprehends the forms of art in a spatio-temporal com- plex. Painting implies the duration of its space: poetry implies the arena of its action. Kinetic elements in the space arts are a basis of a felt duration: imaginal elements in the time arts are the basis of a sensible space. As is usually the case, painters are more concerned about these matters than the critics, and what the painters discover and put into their art the critics will later explain. The Imagists have been de- cried as not proper poets at all because of their technique, which approximates that of painting. Joseph Frank has contended that all of modern literature, especially the work of Eliot, Pound, Proust, and Joyce is intended to be apprehended spatially in a moment of time rather than as a sequence.9 When everything in the poem becomes reflexive, when it must be understood in terms of a time instant, as when a novel must be understood as compressing the life of a city into a single day (Ulysses), literature has turned to the "pregnant moment" which Lessing thought proper only to painting and sculpture. The work of the surrealist artists has been interpreted as an attempt to recapture the sense of time through the intensification of perspective, giving room for a theatre of action, even if this action be only nostalgic or psychotic. Vorticism and Futurism have ac- cented the kinetic possibilities of painting, and they present a before and after, as well as a present; again transgressing the norm. I have no wish to contend that such inter-medial relationships, especially between the media in space and time, are in all cases obvious, or even significant, and it is certain that much of the writing which presumes to discuss inter-medial relationships is perilously close to nonsense. It is essential to point out, however, that the major arts 4 "Spatial Form in Modern Literature," Sewanee Review, LIII, 2, p. 225.</page><page sequence="11">322 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL are expressive media, and that they deal with problems which are apprehended by the mind under forms which are spatio-temporal. As a consequence, though the time in literature is fiction, and the space in painting is illusion, and the Devil has two jumps on us to begin with, the implication of a subdominant form and the possi- bility of a "debasement" in manner is as old as esthetics itself. It may be wondered whether the notion of higher generic qualities in manners of treatment is valid for all the major arts, in both the basic media, in space and in time. If such is the case then we might expect a correlate in the arts of time of the manner of treatment described as "linear," and indeed Greene indicates this in his note of the possibility of an accord between linear and melodic, though he is careful to insist on the necessity of stylistic vitality for such an accord. This conforms to the demand of Venturi for an avoidance of excessive "abstraction" in the history of art. The suggestion of such an accord between melodic and linear manners of treatment is at once enticing and elusive since it may be entertained on several levels of abstraction: as element, as idea, and as manner. The dan- ger is that in such examination we shift the level of abstraction as we pass from one medium to another and thus destroy the possi- bility of fruitful analog. The relation out of context of a simple line and a simple melody, and the characterization of these simple elements without reference to the vitality of the style may prove futile, or nonsensical, if not guided by the negative criteria which demand the notion of contemporaneity in the space arts, and con- tiguity in the arts of time. To look at Leonardo's drawings and to hear the simple melodies he played on his flute, and to discover the generic relationships is the "esthetic" foundation of criticism and history, and the valid foundation of the search for common quality. The possible interrelationships of the two basic media can hardly be indicated here. Such a program is ambitious but it is one of the necessary conditions of a definition of the Zeitgeist. I believe that it is being practiced by certain contemporary historians, though perhaps without a sufficiently explicit theory of the method. Such historians tend to deal in the very widest analogs between cultures, and there is a frequent compound of insight and nonsense. The analog is proposed, but strengthened only by the figure of speech. Thus Friedell writes ". . . we have described Rationalism as a toxic element. . . ." He has overcalled the demonstrable analog with a figure, which may take a literary form: the simile, the metaphor, the conceit. As an example of the type of synthesis which does not practice</page><page sequence="12">TOWARDS A METHODOLOGY IN ART HISTORY 323 the overcall of the analog, nor the extensive use of the figure, I should like to point to the work of Huizinga who makes use of inter-medial exploration on the frank assumption of a common spirit.'" I choose one of the notes in comparison of verbal and plastic expression in the fifteenth century: "Let us take the brothers Van Eyck as being the most eminent representatives of the art of the epoch. Who are the men of letters to be matched with them, in order to compare their inspiration, their modes of expression? We have to look for them in the same environment whence came the great painters, that is to say . . . in the environment of the court, the nobility and the rich middle classes. There we may assume an affinity of spirit to exist. The literature which may be matched with the art of the brothers Van Eyck is that which the patrons of paint- ing protected and admired" (op. cit., p. 255). It is to be noted that contiguity and contemporaneity are assumed throughout as conditions for the common spirit. In proceeding to a further examination Huizinga notes that the subject matter of literature was profane, and that of art was religious, but he imme- diately mitigates this dichotomy by the indication that it is over- drawn, that much of the profane art has been lost, and much of the religious literature, which occupied the most important place in the libraries, has been abandoned by literary criticism. With this passing discursive remark on the subject matter in general he proceeds to a much more lengthy discussion of the formulation. He notes an "essential tendency" (the exact phrase used by Panofskyl) in the late Middle Ages to carry to extreme degrees the "giving [of] con- crete form to every concept of the mind." (A remarkable, though stylistic, parallel of the formulation by Langer of the symbolizing process.) Here is the language of the historian, one who has learned that out of art may come vital indications of the history of any age, which is in every respect the statement of a method and a philosophy of the inquiry into common spirit of any age. The assumptions are none other than the fundamental assumptions in the act of the mind in its capacity for symbolization, freely stated as such. The point at which art history ceases to be history and becomes literature need not concern us overmuch if the level of abstraction is maintained; literature is not always nonsense. To work within the legitimate boundaries of the space arts is not necessarily to prac- tice an excessively abstract mode of vision, as we have seen, but the degree of abstraction must be held to consistently, or any shift in abstraction must be noted clearly. Thus it may be recognized that 1 The Waning of the Middle Ages, Arnold, London, 1937.</page><page sequence="13">324 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL the oppositions of Wolfflin are in the spatial arts, set up in terms of visual oppositions of manner of treatment, and as such it is an extremely valuable contribution to the history of Western art. This procedure does not deny the place of content in art, it has in fact contributed greatly to an understanding of the Baroque as a style with a content of its own, rather than a mere degenerescence of form. In whatever basic medium the expressed content be put, the arts of space or the arts of time, the facts that a public subject matter may be incidental has been made much of in the formalist criticism of the last few decades. But incidental is not the same as irrelevant. Proof of a common quality in the expressed content, content made particular under generic form, is of infinitely more significance than identical subject matter. What is common to Jane, Countess of Harrington and Perdita is of more import, in art, than the fact that Jane and Mrs. Robinson are the persons portrayed: the grand style, the gesture of the Classic, the upward swirl of the Baroque with nature coming closer to the foreground as a prescient indication of the coming English romanticism, all these are unrolled in the cavalcade from Jane to Perdita, and inform the vitality of the grand style. Granted a legitimacy for the means of establishing the formal relationships existent among the arts of space, what are the bases for an assumption of a common spirit from a common or generic form? Certainly the problem is not only a problem of method, and if science is method only, then it is not a scientific problem. We may be granted the same epistemic and psychological tools for an inquiry into generic form which have served the scientist in the establish- ment of his genera, but these tools have proven themselves unable to solve the traditional problems of meaning in art if used only in the method in which the scientist grants their use. We cannot accept subject matter as the basis of the assumption of a Kunstwollen on the penalty of a neglect of "expressed content," though I would qualify this somewhat to indicate the exact relation of the iconic sign to designata, which is the area in which expressed content becomes meaning. The mannerist painter who carries on the graphic and iconic means of a vital style without realizing the shift in content brought by each new age is an excellent example of a semblance, a traditional and accepted cloak, substituting for the reality of meaning which is great art. The Caracci angels are a heavenly fruit, something which a man might pinch, and the Gods decline; certainly neither the human angels of Van Eyck, nor the</page><page sequence="14">TOWARDS A METHODOLOGY IN ART HISTORY 325 Olympian hierarchy of the Sistine Chapel; rather they are confec- tions representing the religiosity of the school. Inevitably such triviality, whether composed in terms of a sanction, or in terms of a personal affection, is subject to the ultimate judgement, the moral determinant. When the mannerist painter is unable to distinguish between the cloak and the body, when he mistakes the cloak for the body, his case is lost. The valid icon of the past is not a cloak, but a form, a body itself. This does not mean that radically new medial experimentation can always be mistaken in its optimum area of human experience. The traditional theme may become living in modern treatment: Hayter may etch Ulysses. Anachronism cannot thus be determined on the basis of subject-matter, another indication that the area of common concern, the extensionality of the designatum of a work of art, cannot be the adequate indication of the common intension. What the painters and the poets mean is a more fundamental clue to their common impulse than what they talk about. Thus we shall have to look elsewhere than in Greece for the intension which gov- erns Mourning Becomes Electra, Ulysses, and R. Strauss' Elektra. Thus far I have argued that the method of artistic induction, though not worked out in comprehensive methodology, is sufficiently operative to allow of the assumption that art history and criticism are disciplines worthy of the confidence of a wide practice. Certainly it has been practiced in Europe as an aid to general history. The substitution of an esthetic for beauty is not a solution of the prob- lem, but it is an indication that its formulation has changed: this is as far as we can go in concession to the method of science, which tends to substitute psychology for philosophy as a guiding force. I have also indicated that a summary formal and generic formal guidance in method is the best assurance that the fundamental nature of the data of artistic induction will be preserved at all levels of abstraction. To neglect this consideration is to mistake the nature of the whole problem. We must take adequate account of docu- mentation and affective response but these are subject to correction at the hands of a genuine iconography. Those who wonder at the work of art in the name of science tend to chop it to bits. The work of art is an act of meaning, and after it has been broken into parts it returns to perception, miraculously whole. University of Kentucky Lexington, Ky.</page></plain_text>
