Eligio dictated his own tales in Spanish. He had learned most of them while in 19</page><page sequence="2">278 .7ournal of American Folk-Lore. camp on trading trips. As among the arrieros of Spain this is a favorite time for story telling. Someone proposes: Quita un cuento ! Saca un cuento ! The women do not know los cuentos, opined Eligio, and then Isidora, the curandera, told us the best tale we had yet heard. To be sure Isidora had learned them from her father, and besides, Isidora is in many ways an exceptional woman.1 The early type of Spanish tales (the rabbit cycle and tales of the saints)2 and what survives of Indian tales are probably not usually told by women. The tales of Dofia Angelica and of Rosa which are either humorous or are of the miirchen type were not learned from Mitleyenos. Rosa's tales came from Tlacolula, a pueblo more mestizo in character than Mitla. Whatever the tales, story telling as an art has little vogue in Mitla which is not mestizo enough to be a nursery for Spanish tales nor indio enough to have preserved its Indian tales, a condition that probably holds among most of the Indian or idioma-speaking towns of Mexico. Indeed had I not returned for a second visit to Mitla I would have been persuaded that no Indian folktale had survived in this rapidly modernizing town. Some Indian traits, yes, language, sucking out disease, provisioning the dead for their life underground, lavish barter of food on ceremonial occasions, many aspects of the material culture, but Indian myth or tale, no, not a trace. Then on my second visit we found Miguel Mendez, labrador de madera, .and heard his tales of Sus Ley and of Lightning which in spite of Spanish insertions are proper Indian tales, and Miguel told them too like an Indian, as if he believed them. I don't think he questioned that the Old Ones who built Las Ruinas went underground and became stone after the sun appeared, as a secondary creation. When Miguel was telling this or when he told of how Izidro, the living man, remained in church as a saint, an image, I could hear a Pueblo Indian of New Mexico tell of spirit animals and anthropomorphic spirits be- coming stone when the world was hardening after the people emerged from below into a still sunless world, and I recalled the story of the Zufii santu who chose to live at Acoma because she liked the dancing there, and the Tewa-Spanish story of San Escapula who would not stay put until they built his "house" where he wanted it. San Escapula, by the way, is one of the twenty-one saints venerated in Mitla, where too he is muy milagroso. The witch and devil tales and anecdotes of Mitla I am reserving as illustration of various attitudes of the townspeople. 1 See Parsons, E. C. Curanderos in Oaxaca, Mexico. The Scientific Monthly, XXXII, 4-5. 1931. 2 All I mean by Spanish tales of early or of late type is a distinction between tales that have been told in the town for a hundred years or more and tales recently introduced. I have noted the same distinction in Spanish tales told by the Pueblos of New Mexico. (Parsons, E. C. Tewa Tales, 3-5. MAFLS XIX. 1926.)</page><page sequence="3">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 279 I. SUS LEY (THE BARREN WOMAN)I. There was a woman called Sus Ley2 married to a man called Gisa'. Gisa' did no work, he would lie in his house on his back (S., boc' arriba; Z., gisa')3. Sus Ley would give him to eat thirteen4 baskets (tenates) of tortillas and thirteen jars of food (ollas de comida). From having to prepare so much food she became vexed. So she took to live with her two orphans. The little boy (hombrecito) was named Julian; the little girl (mujercita) was named Lun (S., luna). Every day they would go out in the country to kill rabbits and doves and sometimes deer. The boy used a blow gun (S., servatana; Z., girukwa'a). Of all the animals they got they were not given to eat any of the meat, only a soup (caldo); the meat was eaten by old man Gisa' (gol Gisa'). The children were suffering from hunger. One day they met a man who was San Anton. San Anton said to them, "Children (muchachos), for a long time you have been suffering from hunger. You do not get any of the meat of the animals you kill, only a soup. Go to the spring and there kill two deer." When they reached the spring they saw two deer. The boy did not kill them; he lassoed them and took them home. When they reached home Sus Ley was very much pleased with the deer. The children hid and watched what she did with the meat. She gave it all to Gisa'. The girl said, "What we should do is to return to the same place where we met San Anton." And when they saw San Anton, he said to them, "Go and kill two more deer, and skin them. Get all the creatures that sting and put them inside the bodies - wasps, gutip, golgisye', be's mator, be's ser (abejas de cera), be's panal." When they got home they killed Gisa' and took out his heart and put the stinging creatures into his body. They gave the heart to Sus Ley, saying they had killed a deer but were able only to bring home the heart. While the heart was cooking, Sus Ley went to the river to wash. There she heard a voice saying, "Wausa'! Wausa'!" Cannibal! She looked 1 Told by Miguel Mendes. Aged 56. He heard the tales from his uncle, Donaciano Santiago, aged 80. Fragments of this tale of Sus Ley, shcuent sus ley, are known to a number of townspeople, and the name of Sus Ley to still more who think of her as a weaver. To a weaver may be said as a cliche, "You are doing the work of Sus Ley." Possibly Sus Ley is a personage of pre-Conquest myth. Cf. J. Eric Thompson. Ethnology of the Mayas of Southern and Central Honduras, 120-122. Pub. 274 Field Mus. of Nat. Hist. Chicago, 1930. 2 Sus, woman; ley, without children, (S., sola), an obsolete term, but it is applied to corn growing sparsely - gulin ley, nacen salteado. 3 Larak gol Gisa', pareces gol Gisac, you are like old man Gisa', may be said to a lazy child. ' Thirteen is a numeral favored by the Zapotecas, presumably from a pre-Spanish habit. One telling instance is in the burial of miniature tortillas with the dead, thirteen tortillas. ' W1Vau &gt; gaulu, to eat; sa', companion. 19 *</page><page sequence="4">280 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. everywhere. "Wausa'! Wausa' i" It was the voice of Frog, but she could not see anything. After she finished bathing, she went back to the house. When she got there the dinner was cooked. She went to where Gisa' was lying down and shook him. "Come! Let us eat." The stinging creatures came out and stung her and she saw that Gisa' was dead. "Ah! Cursed be the orphans who killed their father! I will ask my brother what to do." When she found her brother she told him what had happened. He said to her, "When you go back, tell the orphans to build a fire in the temescal (sweat-bath). When it is hot we will put them into it and kill them." Sus Ley returned to her house and told the orphans to make a fire in the temescal. Meanwhile the children had been talking again to San Anton.He said to them, "Children, you will be told to make a fire in the temescal. It is to burn you up. While your little sister is lighting the fire, make a hole on the other side. When you go into the temescal, take with you a basket of thorns (piqcantes) and some blades of maguey. Put them into the fire to make it spark and the woman will think you have burned up." When the brother of Ley arrived, he was called Ros,1 he seized the children and put them into the temescal. They had done as San Anton had told them. Ros went into the temescal with them and was so blinded by the smoke that he did not see them come out by the hole on the other side. The children went to the house and got all Ley's things - the sticks of her loom, tsiirp', tugi-syl, tugyep, her ring (S. anillo, Z. nil), berg' (jarro), berkwu (peine) and off they ran. Ros came out of the temescal and followed them as they ran. When they felt they were getting tired, they cast down the jar (bergc) and it turned into Jar Mountain (dan berg'). When Ros reached the mountain he could not pass, and the children went on. Further on, they cast down the ring and it changed into Gibinil.2 The children went on and they cast down the tsiurp" which changed into a mountain of thorns. Ros was caught in the thorns. The children went on and cast down the tugi-syl which changed into a precipitous mountain. Further on they cast down the tugyep which changed into the mountain range near Huchitengo. When they cast down the tugyep the little boy said, "This is the last thing we have. Now what shall we do ?" Then came to them San Antonio and said, "Make thirteen ovens and fill them with wood and stone and build fires so that when Ros comes up the stones will be very hot and with them you can kill him." When Ros overtook them the stones were hot and the children threw them into his mouth. When they had thrown all the stones in the thirteen ovens, Ros fell down dead. Julian got a little ant and told it to go and see if the man was dead 1 Zapoteca for imbecile, tonto, boc' abierta. 2 The mountain now called Gibini.</page><page sequence="5">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 2 8 I or only asleep. The ant crawled over the head of Ros and when it returned it said, "He is dead." Then the children approached the dead man. The girl was quicker and she took out his right eye which shone bright, and the boy took out the left eye which was less bright. Then they began to quarrel over the eyes, Julian having the eye that was less bright and his sister the brighter eye. So they went on their way quarreling. They came to a place where there was no water. Luna was very thirsty and she said to Julian, "Little brother, I am very thirsty, I want a drink of water." Julian began to dig down and water came out. Julian took a drink. When Lun started to drink the water began to dry up. Julian said, "Sister, put down the eye so you can take the water." But she would not put the eye down. Julian had with him a rabbit he had caught and he said, "Let us exchange. I will give you the rabbit for the eye." But the girl would not do it until she heard the voice of Maria Purissima saying, "Put the eye down, daughter, so you can get the water." So Luna put down the eye, and then very quickly Julian put his eye in the place of hers and hers in the place of his. Luna did not like this and they went on their way still quarreling. They came to where our Lord was standing. "My children (hijos), how are you?" They answered that they were well. He said, "Now I will assign to you your destiny (destino). You, Julian, you have the eye which shines more, you will work by day and Luna will work by night. Now there will be light in the world, for it is an ugly thing (leo) for it to be so dark." And thus there were the sun and the moon. And all the old ones (rebengulal) were afraid and hid away under ground. VARIANT.2 There was a woman called Sus Ley and her husband was called Gisa'. He lived in a cave in a mountain and Sus Ley lived in the pueblo and every day she went to leave food for Gisa'. She had some ollas de nixtamal. In the morning when she woke up she saw much nixtamal was lacking. So she began to watch who was robbing her nixtamal. One night she saw it was a toad (sapo). "Ha! ha!" said Sus Ley, "you are the one coming to rob me of my nixtamal. Now I will kill you." The toad answered, "Don't kill me! Certainly I came to rob your nixtamal because I have been doing a lot of work to maintain two criaturitas I have there in the river. Now if you wish, Sefiora, I will give them to you." - "With much pleasure," answered Sus Ley. The toad took her to the river and showed 1 Referring to the idols, los idolos. These old ones, los antiguos, are also referred to as rebentiem, gente tiempo, people of (that) time. Cp. Thompson, citing Tozzer, 166. As soon as the first sun was born, the first people who built the ruins turned into stone. 2 Told by Pedro Zamora.</page><page sequence="6">282 5ournal of American Folk-Lore. her the little children. Sus Ley was much pleased (mas contenta) when she saw them. So she took them up and carried them to her house. Day by day the children grew. In time the children were useful doing her errands. Until one day Sus Ley said to the children, "Hijos, go and leave the tortillas for your father." So every day the children went to leave dinner for Gol Gisa', old man Gisa', until one day the hombrecito said to Sus Ley, "Mama, I am going to buy a flecha1 for myself, for every day I come across rabbits, hares and many doves." So Sus Ley sent to buy a flecha and the child was much pleased. When he returned home every day he carried rabbits, hares and doves to Sus Ley and Sus Ley was much pleased. When the hombrecito was a little bigger he would kill deer and Sus Ley was much pleased. But one day they went to leave dinner for Gisa' and then the little boy (Z., nigie') said to his sister, "Let us kill the old man," and his little sister (Z., bisiana) answered, "No, don't you know he is our father ? " - "Even so," said the little boy, "I am going to kill him." He got his flecha and killed Gol Gisa'. He took out the heart and they went back to where was Sus Ley. When they reached her they said to her that they had killed a deer, but as the animal was very big, they could not carry it, they could only take out the heart. And Sus Ley was much pleased. She went to put on the dinner. As she was putting the heart into the hot water, she heard a voice saying, "Do not put the heart in the hot water, because it is I. The orphans with you came and killed me." Sus Ley did not put in the heart, but buried the heart. Then Sus Ley said to the children, "Make a fire in the temescal, so you can go inside for a little," and the orphans answered, "All right." In a few minutes it was very hot. The children had made a hole on the other side of the temescal, and Sus Ley, thinking they were inside, was going to kill them. The children looked for two pencas de maguey. When Sus Ley told them to go inside the temescal, the children took the maguey blades (heads?) in with them. Then Sus Ley followed and her brother Ros stood at the door of the temescal watching lest the children come out. The children went to the other side of the temescal and Sus Ley found in their place the maguey. Thinking it was the children, she seized it and put it into the fire. The maguey began to spark out and Sus Ley was much pleased. She said that they were paying for the death of their father. But in a little while, not hearing them cry, she said to her brother, "Now these guilty ones have escaped." And Ros said to her, "Don't mind, sister, they can only get tired." And Ros turned himself into a large serpent and followed them. Soon the children grew tired. Up came the serpent, to eat the little boy. As the little boy was very quick he was able 1 This does not refer to a bow and arrow which are unfamiliar to the Zapoteca and appear not to have been used in pre-Spanish times (I have never seen an arrow point on the ground or offered as an antiquity.) The flecha is a curious modification of the blowpipe, the pellet or shot being propelled by the release of one end of a bent cane or cane bow in the pipe.</page><page sequence="7">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 2 8 3 to kill the serpent with his flecha. When the mujercita saw that the creature was dead she leaned down and pulled out its right eye and the little boy seeing that, got the left eye. Then they went on their way at a run. But as they ran the little boy proposed to the little girl to exchange the eyes, but the little girl did not want to. They went on their way and the boy still wanted to exchange but the girl did not want to. They came to a river and were very thirsty and the boy drank, but when the girl leaned down to take water into her mouth the water withdrew from her. Then the little boy said to her, "Leave the eye to one side, so you can get the water; but if you keep the eye you will never be able to drink any water, little sister." As the little girl was very thirsty, she dropped the eye to one side and thus she was able to get the water. And at that moment the little boy exchanged the eyes, putting his in the place of hers. When the little girl finished drinking she saw it was not the eye she had before. She began to cry, asking why her brother had exchanged it. They went on their way, quarreling all the time, day and night. They met datgol, grandfather. He said to the little girl, "Why are you crying?" She started to tell him the story, how they had killed a serpent and she had taken out the right eye and her brother the left eye; when they went to take water the little boy exchanged the eyes; "and this is the quarrel we have," said she. And the little grandfather (abuelito) said to her, "Don't cry, hijita, it is nothing. You can go with me." When they arrived in the house of the little old grandfather he assigned them their destiny. The little boy, because he had the eye which shone more, was to be the sun, and the little girl, because she had the eye which shone less, was to be the moon. For this, they think today that the little boy is the sun, and the little girl is the moon. This was not an ordinary old man who did this; it was gyeb Dios. Antes, long ago, when los Montezumas made the ruins, there was no sun. After the Spaniards came los Montezumas or gulal or idolos went to the Lake at Mexico where in one moment they received hot food from Spain. 2. LIGHTNING.1 There were two compadres. One was called Sebastian and the other Pablo. Sebastian was compadre with el Rayo (Z., Gusi'), Lightning, and every year he had large crops. So Pablo said, "Compadre, how is it you have such large crops ? I plant the same amount and have no such crops." Sebastian answered, "Compadre, you know I go to the cueva del Rayo and he is my compadre. For that reason all my crops are assured (muy seguro)." So said Pablo, "Compadre, will you not do me the favor to take me to that cave ?""2 - "With much pleasure," answered Sebastian, 1 Told by Miguel Mendes. 2 The cave is in the mountain side northwest of Mitla.</page><page sequence="8">284 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. "only when we arrive in the cave, do not be afraid. Only bring two candles and tomorrow very early we will go to that place." The next day the two compadres went and when they arrived in the cave there was Lightning. They saluted him and Lightning gave them seats. Then said Sebastian to Lightning, "Compadre, I have come to see you for you to do me a great favor. I bring here my brother (Z., be'ts) who is also my compadre. We come to see you that you may give him good crops, algo de fortuna." - "Very well, Compadre," answered Lightning, "we will arrange it after breakfast." Then Lightning hastened to serve breakfast to the compadres. In a few moments he began to serve them a very small gourd cup (ficara) of atole and bisiunt (tortilla) which he served to Sebastian; and Pablo seeing that thought to himself, "Ai dios mio, how can this ficara and tortilla suffice for me, for I am very hungry ?" Lightn- ing knew what he was thinking. Then Lightning served Pablo the ficara and the tortilla. They began to eat. Sebastian ate and was well satisfied and Pablo could not finish the ficara nor the tortilla.1 So Pablo said, "Compadre (Z., bal), many thanks that we have eaten." Lightning answered, "Compadre, but you have to finish all the atole I gave you and the tortilla." - "Compadre, I can not, I am very full." - "No, Compadre," said Lightning, "you have to finish because before receiving the cariiio you thought there would not be enough." Pablo said, "Yes, Compadre, I understand." And Lightning said, "Now you understand; another time you will not think it is not enough." He gathered up his jicara and put it in his kitchen. He returned to the compadres. Lightning sent for two girls; one girl was blind in one eye, the other was very simpatica, huera bonita. Then he said to Pablo, "Now which of these girls will you take? Here you have the crops." Pablo decided to take the girl who was simpatica and Sebastian took the one-eyed girl. Lightning said to Sebastian, "Now, Compadre, you have satisfied the desire of your brother, you brought him here. Now his fate (Z., suert, Sp., suerta) is to be poor for all his life; because he chose the pretty one and not the ugly one. The one-eyed girl was richness, maize and beans, and the pretty girl was only weed (acahual)." So Sebastian said to his brother, "Now you see, brother, do not say I am to blame, your fortune will be to be poor all your life." To take leave of them Lightning said to Pablo, "That you may not have come in vain, I will give you these grains of corn (maizitos). I give you white, yellow, morado (dark, i. e. black), velatobo (which is not as dark). You will plant them the day our compadre Sebastian begins to plant." When the compadres arrived in this pueblo, they took leave one of the other, and Pablo went to his house. When he reached his house he got some sacks and put a grain in each sack. When he woke up the 1 The theme of the miniature vessel which is inexhaustible is very popular among the Pueblo Indians.</page><page sequence="9">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 285 next day he saw that all the sacks were full of corn.1 Such was his pleasure that he went to see his brother. He told him what had happened to the grains of corn he brought from the cave, and Sebastian said, "Now conserve carefully those grains and if one day you go alone to see our compadre Lightning, be careful not to think anything bad." Said Pablo, "And when are we going to plough our land?" His brother said, "Did you not hear our compadre tell us that he would notify us (with thunder) when we were to plough our land ? What you should do now is to prepare your seed corn for the first rains when we will plant." So they did. At the first rain-fall they began to plant. In a few months the milpas of Sebastian came out very good and the milpas of Pablo were nothing but weeds, no corn. So Pablo thought of all Lightning had said to him. Pablo did his best to cultivate his land, but he never was able to clean up his land. 3. THE FLOWERS OF THE FANDANGO.2 There were three sisters in a ranch when a boy passed by. He saw that the girls were very simpaticas. The boy went to his house. When he arrived in his house, he sent them to ask for the girl but without saying which girl. The go-between (huehuete) went to the girls' father and he agreed to give one of his daughters. "Which one did the man like ?" he asked the huehuete. The huehuete said, "I think it is the oldest." The youth lived with the girl a long time, then he abandoned her and lived with the younger one. When the first woman saw her sister was going to marry the same man, she went to the mountain and as she went along on the mountain she met an abuelito (Z., dat bengol) and he asked the girl, "What are you doing ?" The girl told him all the story. The little grand- father said, "You are going to stay in this place, you will change into flowers, into gisa', gibiersah, gitoc3, and later you will see how they will carry you, and you will be the first to enter the church." In a few days the little grandfather came to the pueblo. When he arrived in the house of the father of the girl, he saw they were preparing for a wedding and the little grandfather told them that in one part of the mountain there was a very fragrant flower which was called gisa' (which means "of the same family"). And the father of the girl wondered and sent for his gulaneches4, giving them tortillas, bread, meat, mescal, cigarro, half they were to eat, the other half to leave where the flowers were. When the hortelanos, gardeners (Z., werter; S., huerto) arrived there the little grandfather said to them, "Speak to the flower, so you can carry it away, and leave the 1 Again a Pueblo Indian folk tale incident. Also, I may add, lightning is associated with fertility in the Southwest. 2 Told by Miguel Mendes. 3 Gisa' is a small red flower; gibiersah is a plant with a small leaf used for wedding wreaths; gito' has a yellow bloom and is made up into bouquets for guests at weddings and mayordomnias. 4 Collaborators at entertainments.</page><page sequence="10">286 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. half of what you carry in this place." The gardeners said, "I have come for you from the father of the bride." The flower answered, "Let us first eat breakfast." After breakfast, they were able to take all the flowers they wanted. When they had gathered all three plants, they heard the voice of the girl saying, "When you arrive in the pueblo, tell the bride to have them put down a camarazo (gunpowder in a mortar). After the camarazo take a look at the jar of tepache." When the gardeners reached the house of the bride, they told all they had seen and heard and that they were to send off a camarazo and to take a look at the tepache, i. e. taste it. Because of this, they have the custom now that those who fetch the flowers for a wedding carry with them their tortillas, bread, mescal and cigarros, and when they arrive with the plants they send off a camarazo and the plant bearers are the ones to drink the tepache. 4. HUMMINGBIRD IS GO-BETWEEN.1 There was a king who went to a hummingbird (S., chuparosa ; Z., bidunt) to ask him to be go-between (S., huehuete; Z., betsgol) in the house of another king. When the go-between arrived in the house of the king he said, "I have come to see you, as the other king sent me to ask for your daughter in marriage for his son." Said the king, "Now that you have come to ask, what thing did they send ?" - "Sefior," said Hummingbird, "there they have nothing, no mescal, nothing." - "Cabrvn," said the king, "how is it they have nothing in the city you come from ?" Said the king to Hummingbird, "Tell the king, my compaiiero, I can decide a year from now." When Hummingbird returned to the house of the king, the king asked, "How was your journey?" Hummingbird answered, "It was very bad, because the king I went to asked for cigarettes. But where was I to get them ? He told me to return at the end of a year." - "All right," said the king, "you can wait for that time, unless it were better for us to return in eight days before my son is of another mind." While they were talking the son of the king was standing in the window and saw two drunks coming along. One of the drunks said, "Ojala! even if the king told me to make a bird that would go to Heaven I would do it." And the other said, "If the king told me that I should make a key that would open all the rooms the king had, I would make it." Then the boy told his father what the drunks had said. And the king answered, "Let them alone. I am not going to pay any attention to them. Your affair is what interests me." Then said the king to Hummingbird, "The thing to do is go and see the musicians." Hummingbird went to see the musicians. When he reached thehouse of the master, he said, "Ihave come to see you. I am sent by the king. I am come as betsgol. Have the goodness to step to the house of the king." And the master said, "With much pleasure. Tell the king we are at his orders." When Hummingbird came to the king 1 Told by Pedro Zamora.</page><page sequence="11">Zapoteca and Spanisk Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 2 8 7 he said, "Sir King, I have carried your message. The musicians will be here in a few minutes, at your orders." When the musicians arrived in the king's house, he went with them to the house of the other king. When they reached the house of the other king, said the father of the groom, "I have come to see you about what my go-between said, that one year the term would be, but I am going to ask of you the favor not to postpone it so long. Let us arrange it as soon as possible." The father of the bride agreed, saying that the next day at four in the morning' they might get married. When the hour arrived they had the wedding, and they had the fandango (Z., sa'). But Hummingbird did not like it, because he had not a moment to rest. Then he found a moment to leave the king's house and go to his own house. When the guests (S., invitados; Z., regolech) saw that the go-between was not there, they all withdrew from the fandango. Finished, ja se acabo (Z., agulushni). 5. HOW THE FIRST PEOPLE WERE MADE.2 The true God3 took up one ounce of earth and began to work it. "What are you doing ?" asked God's sister. God answered, "Something that you may not know more about than I know." He made an image (mono) in the shape of a man and set it to dry. He blessed it (with the sign of the cross) and it changed into a man. "What were you doing?" asked God. The man answered, "I was sleeping." God gave him a pick and a pala and took him to a spring and told him to make a ditch to the garden he (God) had which was dry from lack of water. The man dug the ditch and the water flowed in it into the garden. In a little time the garden began to give fruit. Then God made an oven. He made images of oxen in clay and put them into the oven. When he took them out they had turned into live animals. God said to San Lucas, "Thou wilt be the patron of the animals, so they will abound." San Lucas said, "If you want them to abound, you will have to make a cow." God agreed to this and gave all the animals to San Lucas. And so San Lucas is the patron of the animals. In time many abounded. The man began to cultivate his field. San Havier would go to the field to take him a breakfast of tortillas and one day the man did not want to eat. God asked San Lucas and San Havier why the man was not eating. San Havier said he did not want to eat because he wanted a wife. God said, "I will give him a wife, but today I will not send him any food." San Miguel went to the man and said that God agreed to give him a wife but that today he would not send him any food. The man said that would be all right. The man went 1 Today at Mitla when a man wishes to be married in the church, but not to keep on celebrating for the customary week he is married at four in the morning, when nobody will be abroad to see. 2 Told by Miguel Mendes, when I asked him for a story about the first people in the world. 3 Sp., El mero Dios; Z., gyeb Dios.</page><page sequence="12">288 8ournal of American Folk-Lore. to sleep in his field and as he was sleeping God came and opened his left side and took out a rib and put it alongside the man and when the man awoke his arm was around the woman. Now when you die, there stands San Miguel with a balance. The dead who weigh one ounce go to Heaven and the dead who weigh more than one ounce go to Hell. 6. MARIA AND SAN JOSE.1 Maria Santissima is the sister of the true God (gyeb Dios). When God saw Mari was pregnant, he said to her, "How did it happen? Whose child are you carrying, who is his father ?" Maria would not confess. Then God called a meeting of all the pueblo and set out a table and on it placed a dry stick. When all had come, God told each in turn to pick up the stick and hold it upright. When all had held up the stick God asked if all in the pueblo had held it up. Some one answered that Jose, the carpenter, was missing. This day he was in the mountain cutting wood. God sent to fetch the carpenter. When the carpenter arrived at the meeting, God said, "I sent for you, to see who had committed the offense (abuso) of making my sister pregnant." San Jos4 said that he did not know, he was quite innocent. Then said God, "If you are innocent, raise the stick which lies on top of the table." San Jose leaned over and raised the stick. When he raised it he saw that a lily2 had bloomed from the tip and along the stick had come out green leaves. Then God said, "Why did you say you were innocent? Here you have the proof that you were the cause. Now you are going to take Maria." - "Very well, Father (Z., dat), but I will not merely take her away. Do you give me the wedding." So God had San Juan give him the wedding. After the wedding San Juan baptized (Sp., hechar agua bautisma, Z., batiobnis) God and then God baptized San Juan.3 Then Jose looked for a mule for Maria to ride, being pregnant she could not walk. When Maria tried to mount the mule, it began to jump and it threw Maria to the ground. Then Maria stood up and made the sign of the cross towards the mule, saying, "You, animal, you will be called mule and never will you bear children and you will serve as a beast of burden." This was her curse. Then Jose went to look for a burrito. This animal was very docile. They left for Belen. In the road they met a bad fellow. "Wh4t are you doing ?" asked Jose of the fellow. He was sowing corn, but he answered, "I am sowing stones." Then the fellow noticed that he was actually sowing stones. They passed another fellow planting maguey. They asked him 1 Told by Miguel Mendes. By this title he referred to the story. 2 A red lily is called the asucena de San Jos4. 3 Cp. Pueblo Indians, Parsons E.

He answered that he was planting maguey. And Jose said, "If anyone passes and asks for me, tell him that yes, you saw me pass by, but it was while you were planting maguey." By the next day the maguey had matured and was giving pulque. So when on that day the enemies of Jose passed and asked for him, the owner said, "Yes, I saw him, but it was when I was planting this maguey." So his enemies thought it was five or six years before and paid no attention. Then Jose passed where a farmer was sowing beans and Jose asked what was he sowing and the farmer answered that he was sowing beans. Jose said, "If anyone passes and asks for me, say, yes, you saw me, but it was while you were sowing these beans." When the owner went to his piece the next day he saw his beans were ready to gather. When the enemies of Jose passed by they asked the farmer if he had seen pass by a man with a woman mounted on a burro. The farmer said yes, he had seen them, but it was when he was sowing the beans. So the enemies paid no attention. Meanwhile Jose encountered another farmer and asked, "What are you doing ?" - "I am sowing corn." Jose said, "It anyone asks for me, say, yes, you saw me but it was while you were sowing." And Jose went on his way. The next day the farmer went to his piece and saw it full of ears, ready to harvest. When they arrived, the enemies of Jose, they asked if he had seen a man with a woman mounted on a burro. The farmer answered, yes, he had seen them, but it was when he was sowing. So the enemies said, "How is this ? The owner of the maguey said he saw them when he was planting his maguey. The owner of the bean patch said he saw them when he was sowing his beans, and now the owner of the corn field says he saw them when he was sowing his corn. What we have to do now is to go to King Herodes." They went to King Herodes and they said to him that they had not seen them. Herodes said to them to keep on following Jose until they could get him. The enemies returned and again followed Jose.' Meanwhile Jose had arrived in Belen, in the house of a rich man who kept an inn (posada). Out came the wife of the rich man very vexed and contemptuous. She said to Jose that they should go into the little stable (caballeriso). So they went in with the animals. Jose began to clean the stable, bringing palma, banana leaves, biliu (Z.), laorel (Z., gibalash), gish- gidor (Sp., pasle) and with them he adorned the stable. Then at half past eleven was born Manuel de Jesus, and the cock was the first to flap his wings, crowing "Cristo nacio! Christ is born!" The turkey cried, "Gordo! gordo! Fat! fat!" The steers lowed and the burros brayed, "Cristo is born at Belen!" When the rich man saw that God was sleeping in the stable he told Jose to come into his house, but Jose did not accept and that same night he went on with his journey. When the rich man went to see where Jose had been, he did not see the adornments Jose had made, all was as before, as when Jose had arrived. 1 Cp. Mayas of British Honduras, Thompson, 16I ; Pueblo Indians, Parsons, Isleta, New Mexico, 413.</page><page sequence="14">290 _Yournal of American Folk-Lore. On his way Jose reached the house of a baker and the child Manuel began to pick up some dough dropped by the baker and Maria made a loaf and they asked the baker to lend them his oven to bake the Child's bread. The baker agreed and put the bread into the oven. When he saw that the piece came out larger than the loaf he had baked for himself he exchanged them, putting his loaf in place of the Child's. So there is the belief today that because of the envy of the baker, even if a baker work day and night, he will never become rich. They went on their way. Now Manuel was grown a boy of eighteen. As they went they noticed their enemies were very close. They went into a church. There was a boy named Simon Shim, and Manuel gave him thirteen reales to go and buy food for the apostles. He went to buy the food when he met the enemies and began to play cards with them. Simon Shim lost. Simon Shim said, "I was going to fetch food for the apostles." So the enemies answered, "We will return the money to you, but point out to us Manuel de Jesus." And Simon Shim said, "The one who will be at the end of the table, that one is Manuel." Simon left and rejoined the others. But Manuel knew about it and so he said, "What sort of an errand was that ? Why did you sell me ?" And Simon Shim did not answer. And so Holy Thursday in the morning they seized Manuel and gave him five thousand blows. Then they fastened him to the cross. Then Ponsio Pilato had a smith make some large nails for the hands and feet of Manuel. They went to look for Simon Shim, saying, "You are a big man, you must take hold of the cross and pull it down so that we can see if Manuel is dead, and kill him if he is still alive." But Simon instead of pulling down the cross, raised it up higher. For this they call Simon, -ludo Jesu Cristo. Viernes Santo, Good Friday, they made a procession and the same afternoon they buried him and placed a cock at the grave, and told him whenever the grave shook he was to crow. When the cock felt the earth was shaking he was about to crow, when he heard the voice of Jesus saying to him, "Do not crow until you see me walking seven leagues up in the sky, then you may crow." When the cock saw Jesus up that far in the sky, he crowed, "Cristo nacio!" When he reached the sky, the next day he made la Gloria and on the Domingo de Pascua they had the procession. 7. SAN PABLO 1 In that time there was a king at Mitla, and the general of the king was San Pablo. He was in charge of one thousand men. San Pablo was here in Mitla when they sent for him from the city of Mapas to come and help them because enemies of the capitan were approaching. Before reaching Mapas San Pablo had to cross a big river which was swollen with much 1 Told by Miguel Mendes.</page><page sequence="15">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 29 I water. He was not able to get across and he returned to Mitla. The king asked Pablo, "Why hast thou returned ?" He answered, "Because there was much water in the river." In a few days San Pablo heard that the water had lowered and he could cross and he was to come, the enemies were near. San Pablo started to go; on the road he heard a voice saying, "Pablo, where art thou going ? I will not give thee power to go to that pueblo because thau art no mere man (no es hombre qualquiera)." God said, "Thou art going to be a saint and I do not wish thee to go and fight." Pablo returned to Mitla and became a saint. When the enemies approached, since Pablo was a saint they could not enter the pueblo. So now there is the belief that whatever enemy comes, San Pablo will go out and defend the pueblo.' 8. SAN ANTONIO.2 Vivia una mujer con su esposo y Phombre se fue a su viaje y dej6 sola la mujer. Se fue largo tiempo que ya la mujer ya perdi6 la esperanza, creyendo que su esposo era muerto.

" ?Por que esta usted muy espantada ?" - " gPor que la veo usted muy distraida ?" - "Ai, compadre," le dijo, "tengo miedo porque tuve una noticia que mi esposo ya viene y creo que si me ve con esta criatura me mataria." - "No, comadre," le dijo, "no piense en eso.

Pero antes de todo estare aquf en la casa hasta el dia que 11egue su esposo." El dia que lleg6 el esposo estaba el compadre, luego salud6 el arriero, diciendoles, " iBuenos dias, compadre!" - " iBuenos dias, compadre!" le contest6 el arriero. Y el abuelito le dijo, "Le contare a usted el porque somos compadres. A mi me sucedi6 una desgracia que se muri6 mi esposa, y me qued6 una criatura. Y no podia yo encuentrar una persona que pudiera darle de mamar, por eso vine a pedirle favores a la comadre que diera de mamar a mi criatura. Y por eso me ve usted aquf en su casa. Y asi es qu' espero a usted para que me diga cuanto pudiera ganar la comadre." Y el viajero contest6, "No, compadre, no se cuanto pudiera ganar. Ya usted sabe soy inocente que acabo de 11egar y no puedo decir cuanto pudiera ganar, o como arreglaria." Entonces su compadre sac6 doscientos, pesos dindole a su comadre, diciendoles, "Este dinero le dare en pago de su trabajo. Y le doy las gracias porque ahora podrt retirarme con mi criatura, porque ahora ya lleg6 el compadre que no pudiera ver estorbos aquf en la casa." Diciendo eso se despidi6 de su comadre y de su compadre. Y abraz6 la criatura y se fue para su pueblo.

Y la madre le contesta, "Mientes, hija. g Qu4 abuelito va ver en el rio ?" - "No, madre," le dijo la muchacha, "de veras que alli vi una abuelita con una criatura." Entonces le dijo la madre, "Vete otra vez a ver si todavia esta, y me vienes a visar." Cuando la muchacha regres6 le dijo a la madre que "todavia s'encontraba en el lugar y querfa hablar con usted." Luego la sefiora sali6 para ver el abuelito. Cuando llegaron en el lugar ya tenia la figura de un santo. En- tonces la sefiora le dijo, " C6mo me dices que era un abuelito ?" - "No, mama," le dijo la muchacha, "si el abuelito me dijo que se llama San Antonio, y en el lugar donde 'staba formarin su casa, y tiene que 'star solo." La sefiora al oir lo que su hija le cont6 entonces fue a ver a otras gentes, y adoraron a San Antonio y empezaron a construir su iglesia. Y se qued6 en el lugar que se llama Santa Catarina, que celebran la fiesta el dos de Marzo. 9. SAN IZIDRO 1 It happened once to San Izidro that he was at the house of a rich man. He was working there; he ploughed in the fields. There was a downpour 1 Told by Miguel Mendes.</page><page sequence="17">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 293 of rain, and the master sent for Izidro and he said, "Go to the fields and see if now we can plant." When Izidro reached the piece (pedazo), he saw the ground was very wet, the oxen could not go into it. Then he went to the next piece. That was all right for planting. "Patrdn! we can plant maiz de bolita' so it can yield quickly." - "All right," said the patrdn. So Izidro began to plant the field and he finished in three days. Arrived Izidro in the house of the rico and said he, "Ahora si, patrdn, we can plant the big piece, for it is at the right point." - "All right," answered the master. "In how many days do you think we can finish planting it ?" Answered Izidro, "Probably in six days." - "All right," said the master, "if as you say in six days. Now you can go and plant." At the end of six days Izidro returned to the house of the rico saying the work was finished. The rico wondered how Izidro had finished so quickly. He thought, "Better I go myself to see if it is certain that this boy has planted all the field or if he is cheating me." Then the rico went to look at the piece. When he got there, he saw that it was growing very quickly; there were no weeds; it was all cultivated (pura milpa). "Jesu Cristo!" he said. "It would be well for me to buy more teams for him to work on a larger scale." Then Izidro began to cultivate and he finished within the same time he had planted. So the rico bought three teams. When Izidro saw this, he said to his patrdn, "Why did you buy more teams because I finished the milpas yesterday ?" Answered the patr6n, "I bought the teams so you could go on doing more." Then Izidro began to work with the other servants. There were four. Hardly had they been working ten days together when the servants began to carry tales to the patrdn, saying that Izidro did not work as they did. But the patro'n did not believe them because he had seen how Izidro worked. But the servants went on complaining that Izidro was not working, that his teams lay idle all day. So the wife of the patrdn said to him, "It may easily be true. Better you go yourself to see, because the servants say that he is not working, that he only goes to church." So the patron went to see where he was working. When he arrived at the ground, he saw that the team of Izidro was at work. So the patrdn said to the servants, "Why did you fool me, saying Izidro was not working and now I see that the team is at work ?" The servants answered, "Patrdn, what happened to you ? Did you not see that the team was not working ?" The patrdn answered, "I saw them working." Then the servants said, "One proof, patron do you not see Izidro there coming from the church and yet you say his team is wor- king ?" So the patrdn wondered. When Izidro came up the patrdn said to him, "Izidro," he said, "why did you leave your team without wor- king? Where have you been ?" Izidro answered saying, "Patr'n, I was at church, praying to God that he be with us in our work." - "Bueno !" said the patrdn, and he went home, and the servants stayed behind. Izidro said to them, "Why did you complain to the patron that I went to church ? 1 White corn. 20</page><page sequence="18">294 2ournal of American Folk-Lore. We have hardly been a month together and now you start tittle tattles (chismes)!" When Izidro arrived in the house of the patrdn he was very angry. So the patrdn said to Izidro, "Tomorrow you will work separate." "With pleasure," answered Izidro, "but the field I am to plant let me work on half shares (sembrar a media)." - "All right," said the patrdn. The next day very early Izidro began to work on his field and according to his custom he went to church. In four days Izidro had finished ploughing the piece and on the fifth day he had finished planting. Then he talked to his patrdn saying he had finished his ground. The patrdn wondered how he had finished his piece so soon and went himself to see if it were so. When he arrived he saw that the crop was at a height to be cultivated. When he went to the piece where he had his servants he saw that there were no crops as yet, only acahuales (a weed). In all the pieces where Izidro worked there was a crop and where the others worked there was no crop. So he thought, "How could Izidro do this ?" He began to abuse the other servants, blaming them for having to separate Izidro from them; think- ing that if he had not separated Izidro from the others all his pieces would have yielded as well as the piece Izidro was now working. Then the patrdn called Izidro, saying to him, "Now, Izidro, what are you going to do ?" - "Patrdn," said Izidro, "I have to finish cultivating because the rains will begin very soon and the crop must be in good condition." Izidro very quickly finished his work. Daily he went to church, for he was very devout (muy Catolico). Now came the time to harvest, and Izidro harvested all the piece, When he finished he said to this patrdn, "I have finished harvesting," and the patrdn wondered, "Por Dios!" The patrdn went to see if it were so. When he arrived he saw that all the piece was harvested and all the ears were large. So he called Izidro, "Izidro!" he said. "Patrdn," answered Izidro. "Sell me the piece you have." - "No, patroncito," said Izidro. "I can not sell it, for it is the only one I have to maintain myself by." Then Izidro went to his house, and the patrdn was very anxious to buy all the piece. Next day, very early, the patrdn went to see Izidro to see if he would decide to sell his piece. Izidro had decided to sell. He said, "I can sell all the piece if you pay me the price." The patrdn was very pleased and said, "I will pay what you want." - "Very well, patrdn," said Izidro, "the price is 8ooo pesos, which is the value of my piece, and I make one condition. Give me the gleaning (la repisca). Do me the favor to tell me the day you will harvest, so that I can come to glean." - "All right," said the patrdn. When the day came for the rico to harvest he sent a servant to notify Izidro that on the merrow would be the harvesting. The servant went to Izidro's house and spoke to Izidro, saying, "The patrdn has sent me, tomorrow he will harvest." Izidro said, "How many servants and how many wagons will he take ?" The servant answered, "He is going to take twenty-five servants and ten wagons." - "All right," said Izidro, "I too will get the same number of servants. Tell the patrdn." When the servant returned</page><page sequence="19">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 293 he told his patrdn, "Izidro told me that tomorrow he will come quickly with the same number of people that you have." And the rico laughed, "Caramba! What will Izidro be doing with so many people? He is not going to harvest, only to glean." The next day after breakfast the rico gave orders to his servants not to leave a single ear unharvested, because the piece had cost him a lot. "Very well, Sefior," answered the servants and with the wagons they went to the piece. When they arrived they began to harvest. In a little while they saw Izidro coming with his twenty five servants and ten wagons and women carrying tehate1. When they came to where the rico was, the rico said to Izidro, "Hombre, Izidro, where are you going with so many people ?" - "Sefior," answered Izidro, "I have come to glean according to the agreement we have. You can say if it suits you. If not, you can return the money, and I will harvest what belongs to me." The rich man remained convinced, saying, "All right, Izidro, you can go on to glean." The servants of Izidro entered the piece and began to gather the ears. The rico wondered. When the servants of the rico filled a wagon the servants of Izidro also filled one. When they finished filling the ten wagons in the afternoon, Izidro too had filled his ten wagons. So the rico said, "Izidro, you too have done a foolishness. You asked the price of your work and see now how many ears you have." Izidro answered, "Yes, Sefior, for this was our contract. You were to give me the gleaning, and this gleaning I have made so as to leave a custom for all the poeple, something for them to remember.2" When the harvest was finished, the rico said to Izidro, "Now I under- stand what you are." - "All right," said Izidro, "now you see what I am." And Izidro went to his house. As Izidro was very devout every day he went to the church. Thus he passed his days. At the end of a few months he entered his granary (troja) and he saw that he had sold all his corn. He took outside all the empty sacks and spoke to the birds, to the little turtle dove (la tdrtolita, Z., guk'), el zanate (Z., baka'), gorridn (Z., bichi'). "Now, I am shaking these bags in your sight, you see all my corn is finished and I have none for you and I am taking farewell of you." Then the little turtle dove answered, "Do not bid us farewell, for I know very well that your corn will never be finished. Every day we will come to visit you." Izidro was very pleased and left his house for the church to pray and tell God that all his crop was finished. When Izidro returned from the church there in his house he heard a voice saying, "Izidro, you are to know, that the fifteenth of May will be your fiesta and that now you do not need to go out anywhere. You will stay in the church." So Izidro thought, "But why am I being told to stay in the church ?" So thinking he passed by the granary and saw that all the sacks were again full of corn. And Izidro was very happy 1 A tcle, beaten up. 2 It is the custom now for women to glean, for nothing. 20*</page><page sequence="20">296 Yournal of American Folk-Lore. and returned to the church to give thanks to God. After the Mass the true God (gyeb Dios) spoke, saying to him, "Now, Izidro, yoke your oxen and get your plough and come tomorrow with your goad." The next day, very early, Izidro yoked his oxen, got his plough and goad and went to the church. He heard another Mass. After the Mass, gyeb Dios blessed him and he changed into a saint' and did not return to his house. Then God said to him, "Here you will stay so the people will bring you candles, incense and flowers, to ask for all such work as you did in the field." - "All right, Sefior," said Izidro, "also I want something else. The day of my fiesta, May fifteenth, let all the animals be blessed." - "All right," said God. And so until now people have the custom to take their animals to be blessed the day of the fiesta of San Izidro, the fif- teenth of May.2 IO. THE MOTHER OF SAN PEDRO.3 After San Pedro was appointed to hold the key of the door to Heaven his mother died and stood outside the door with the other sinful souls. "Who is that poor woman ?" asked God of San Pedro. "That is my mother," answered San Pedro. "Since she is your mother, let her in!" said God. So San Pedro unlocked the door and she started to go in. The other sinners seing her start to go in clung to her, trying to go in with her, but she shook them off. Even at the door of Heaven she was selfish. "Shut the door!" said God. And so people say, "Beware of being selfish (invidiosa) like the mother of San Pedro!" II. RABBIT AND COYOTE.4 Un sefior tenia una huerta.

Al decir eso, le tir6 la patada. Y se qued6 pegado su pie. Y le dice, "Ya sabes si no me sueltas, voy con el otro lado." Al tirarle la otra patada se le qued6 pegada. Entonces dijo el conejo, "A ver si de veras eres valiente; ahora si te voy a dar uno con el brazo." Le tir6 el manazo, y se qued6 pegado. Entonces dijo el conejo, "Yasabes si no me sueltas, voy con el otro brazo. Eso si," le dijo, "tequebrartla cabeza." Y le tir6 otro manazo y se qued6 pegado. Y el conejo gritando, le dijo, "Cuidate, porque ahora si, voy con la boca. Y ya sabes que mi boca esti envenenada." El conejo le da una mordida muy fuerte.

Cogi6 el conejo, lo despeg6 de la cera, y se lo llev6 para su casa. Al llegar en su casa le puso una cadena. Y lo coloc6 en la ventana. Alli pasaba el conejo todos los dias. Lleg6 un dia cuando vi6 el conejo un coyote que venia en la calle. Entonces le grit6, y le dijo, "Oiga, amigo, ven aquf, te voy a decir una cosa." El coyote se acerc6 en la ventana. Y le dijo, "?

Ya sabes que aqui nos van a servir buenas comidas. O en este momento ven aquf conmigo, y m'esperas aqui y yo ird a traer una gallina, el mas gordo que tiene para tu almuerzo." - "Muy bien," le dijo el coyote, y el acerc6 en el lugar donde 'staba el conejo. Entonces le dijo el conejo, "Pero quiteme este collar que tengo y p6ntelo." El coyote le quit6 la cadena al conejo. Y se lo puso en su pescuezo. Entonces le dijo el conejo, "Ahora si, estis muy bien." Y brinc6 potr la ventana. Y se fue. Y ya no volvi6 otra vez. Cuando sali6 el jardinero a darle de comer al conejo cuando lleg6 en el lugar vi6 un animal muy feo. Luego cogi6 un pedazo de palo y empez6 a pegar al coyote. El coyote hizo el esfuerzo de librarse y pudo salvar la vida. Ya que iba lejos del pueblo entonces decia entre si, solo, "Ahora verd el conejo; adonde le encuentro alli me la voy a comer." Se fue caminando. Cuando lleg6 en unos tunales vi6 el conejo que 'staba comiendo tunas. Entonces le dijo el coyote, "Ahora si, cabroncito, ahora me tienes que pagar lo que me has hecho." El conejo muy asombrado le contesta, " Qud cosa le he hecho, buen Coyote?" - "gC6mo, qud cosa me has hecho ? No te hagas tonto; porque me iba a matar. Si no fuera valiente no salvarfa yo la vida." Entonces le dijo el conejo, "No, hermano, no seria yo porque ya bien sabes que tengo munchos hermanos. Y si yo gritara verbs como me contestan." - "A ver si es cierto," dijo el coyote. Luego el conejo ech6 un grito, y de los cerros se produjo el eco, y crey6 el coyote que eran los otros compafieros del conejo. "Muy bien," le dijo, "ahora si te le creo. Ya seremos amigos." Entonces le dijo el conejo, Arrimate al pie de este tunal y te dejard caer una tuna entre la boca. Pero antes debes tu te cerrar los ojos, y abres la boca." El coyote cerr6 los ojos</page><page sequence="22">298 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. y el conejo dej6 caer una tuna muy bien madura en la boca del coyote. Y le dice el conejo, "gC6mo est6, amigo?" - "Muy bueno," dijo el coyote. Y el conejo le contesta, "Cerra otra vez los ojos y le voy a dejar caer otra mas buena." - "Ya," dijo el coyote. Cerr6 los ojos, y abri6 la boca, y el conejo le dej6 caer una tuna verde con munchisimas espinas, que se ator6 en la garganta del coyote. Viendo eso el conejo se fue corriendo muy contento, y el coyote se qued6 revolcandose. Cuando pudo sacar la tuna de la boca, entonces vi6 en el tunal si estaba el conejo. Vi6 que no habia ninguno y entonces dijo, "Ahora si, ya va dos veces que me hace mal el conejo, pero ahora adonde lo encuentro tengo que comerlo." Y se fue en busca del conejo. Cuando vi6 el conejo que ya lo iba alcanzar se acerc6 al pie de un pefiasco y lo qued6 deteniendo. Cuando lleg6 el coyote en el lugar donde 'staba el conejo, entonces le dijo, "Ahora si, cabr6n, ya es muncho que lo me has hecho. Ahora si te voy a comer." - "Hermano," dijo el conejo, "ni pienses eso. i Que no sabes tui que el mundo se va a acabar ?" El coyote muy admirido le contesta, "gC6mo lo has sabido ?" - "Asi le comunic6 Dios a mi hermano. Y ahora ayfidame un poco! Vamos a detener este pefiasco para ver si podremos salvar el mundo." El coyote muy obediente se par6 a detener el pefiasco. Ya hacia horas quando le dijo el conejo. " iYa tienes hambre ?" - "Ya," le contest6 el coyote. " Puedes detener tu solo para que vaya yo en busca de tu comida ?" - "No tengas cuidado," dijo el coyote. "Anda; no mAs que no te dilatas muncho." Se qued6 el coyote; y el conejo ya no volvi6 otra vez. Ya era muy tarde, el coyote ya tenia muncho hambre, pero cuando vefa que ya el pefiasco se queria caerse, no queria soltarlo. Como veia que las nubes pasaban arriba ya por iltimo se arriesg6 a soltar el pefiasco y di6 un brinco muy violente y se qued6 viendo el pefiasco, pero quando lo vi6 estaba en el mismo lugar. "Ahora si el buen conejo me ha hecho munchos engafios. Pero ire en busca del conejo para comermelo." Sigui6 su camino. Caminaria una legua cuando se encontr6 con el conejo que 'staba tejiendo tenates. Entonces le dice, "Ahora si, Conejo, no m'escapas." - "gPor que, mi buen amigo ?" le contest6 el conejo. "Porque me hicistes tonto, me dejastes deteniendo el pefiasco." - "No s" eso," le contesta el conejo. "Sabes que somos munchos hermanos. Pues ha de ser cierto lo que te ha dicho, porque yo tambien estoy haciendo una defensa para salvar la vida, porque Dios escribi6 a mi hermano diciendole que mafiana que a las doce va a haber una granizada muy fuerte. Y creo que se perdera el mundo." - "Entonces," le contest6 el coyote, "te perdonare con el fin de que tui me hagas una defensa para mi." El conejo inmediatemente se puso a tejer un tenate grande donde puede caber el coyote. Cuando la habia terminado, le avis6 el coyote diciendole, "Aparate, hermano, porque ya mero es la hora." El coyote muy apresurado se meti6 entre el tenate, y le dijo el conejo, "Mi buen amigo, favor de cerrarme muy bien para que no puedan entrar los granizos hasta dentro." El conejo cogi6 una cuerda y se puso a amarrar</page><page sequence="23">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 299 fuertemente. Termin6 su trabajo y entonces le dijo, "Estis asegurado, buen Coyote; yo ire a componer mi defensa." - "Bueno," dijo el coyote, "el Uinico favor que me hagas, de avisarme a la hora que empieza el granizo." Se fue el conejo, y empez6 a recoger piedras. Ya que tenia un mont6n grande. Entonces le dijo el coyote, "Ahora cuidate, buen Coyote, que ya va empezar el granizo." Empez6 el conejo a tirarle de pedradas al coyote, gritindole, "iFuerte, Don Coyote, porque Dios quiere perder el mundo!" Y empez6 mas duro a tirarle de pedradas. Ya el pobre coyote ya no podia gritar porque ya era mucho el dolor. Cuando vi6 el conejo qu1l coyote ya no podia moverse, muy contento sigui6 su camino. Cuando pudo el coyote salir del tenate vi6 todo alredidor que habia munchas piedras amontanadas. Entonces se dijo, "Ahora si, ya no vuelvo a perdonar el conejo. Si lo encuentro me lo voy a comer." Sigui6 su camino con mil pensamientos. De repente fue a dar en un arroyo y vi6 que alli estaba el conejo. Entonces le dijo, "Ahora si, Conejo, me lo vas a pagar." Y el conejo le contesta, " Que es eso ?" - "De los engafios que me has hecho," contest6 el coyote. "No creas, hermano!" dijo el conejo. "Ya tui bien sabes que somos munchos hermanos. Mejor ven ac te mostrare mis alumnos porque yo soy profesor de este lugar." Y ensefi6 el coyote en un agujero donde estaba un panal de avis pas. Entonces le dijo el conejo al coyote, "Mi amigo, tengo mucho hambre. Te pido un favor, que cuidas un poco los nifios, mientras yo ire en busca de nuestra comida. Tenga esta regla. Si a caso no te obedecen los nifios, dales unos reglazos para no hagen mucho ruido." Se qued6 el coyote muy contento viendo los nifios, pero cuando los nifios empezaron a hacer munchos ruidos, fue el coyote a darle unos reglazos en el panal y salieron un mont6n de avispas y le picaron al coyote. Y ste se fue corriendo, como Dios le habia ayudado. 12. WOOD CHOPPER AND LION.1 Habia una liona que tenia un nifio y van en un camino quando le dijo el nifio a su mama que le cuente un cuento. Y la madre le contesta, "No, hijo, no sea que puede estar alguna gente por all' escondido y puede oirselo ?" Y el nifio le contesta, "No, mama, cuentame el cuento que sabes." Entonces dijo la madre, "Hijo, en aquel pueblo existe un hambre de agua pero si fueran en ese pefiasco a tocarle la roca le saldra bastante agua." - "Y si fueramos, mami", dijo el nifio. "No, hijo," contesta la madre, "porque las gentes nos tienen miedo." Y alli mismo s'encontraba un lefiador que habia oido lo que la liona le habia contado a su hijo. Se fue el lefiador para el pueblo. Al llegar en el pueblo fu4 a darle parte al presidente, diciendoles que si le pagaban el lefiador haria brotar agua de la roca. Los del pueblo quedaron conformes. Fue el lefiador y empez6 1 Told by Isidora. Cp. Thompson, i55, for a Maya version of this well known European and American Negro tale.</page><page sequence="24">300 oo ournal of American Folk-Lore. a escabar en la roca. En t4rmino de dos horas sali6 un chorro de agua. Y los del pueblo quedaron muy agradecidos, y le pagaron con una cuantidad considerable. Y la liona segui6 su camino y su hijo le dijo, "Mama, quiero que m'ensefies como es el hombre." Y la madre le contesta, "No, hijo, no' t'ensefiar4 el hombre porque ese es valiente y te podra matar." Y el hijo con su necedad siempre querfa ver el hombre. Se apart6 de su madre, se fu4 entre los montes, en busca del hombre. Iba caminando cuando s'encontr6 un burro. Y le dijo, "i Que tui eres el hombre ?" - "No, amigo," le contesta el burro. "Mira como estoy sufriendo. Todas mis espaldas llenas de heridas producidas por el hombre. Pero si en busca del hombre vienes lo has de encontrar mas adelante." El lioncito sigui6 su camino. Al llegar mas adelante, s'encontr6 un toro, un toro flaco, y le dice, "' Que te tA eres el hombre ?" - "No, amigo," le contest6 el toro, "yo estoy dominado por el hombre. Pero si por el vienes all delante lo encuentras." Sigui6 el lioncito su camino cuando devis6 que estaba un lefiador rajando unas lefias. Se fue y4ndose para donde 'staba el lefiador. Al 11egar le dijo, " ' Que tui eres el hombre ?" El lefiador le contesta que si. Y responde el lioncito, "Pues yo te voy a comer." - "Esta muy bien," dijo el lefiador, "pero antes ayuidame a rajar mi lefia." En un trozo de lefia hizo un abertura y el lioncito fue a meter sus manos en esa abertura. Cuando el lefiador quit6 su hacha del lugar, qued6 las manos del lioncito bien emprensado y empez6 a gritar, pidiendole perd6n al hombre, que quitara sus brazos y que fueran amigos. El hombre con mil siplicas quit6 los brazos del lioncito y lo dej6 en entera libertad. Regres6 el lioncito en el lugar donde habia dejado a su madre. Al l egar la madre le dijo, "gAd6nde fuistes, hijo ?" - "F'i en busca del hombre." - "Y lo encontrastes ?" - "Lo encontr4, madres, pero, mira, mis manos como estin de heridas producidas por el hombre." - "Pero si bien te he dicho que con el hombre ninguno juega." Ya l'otro dia s'encontr6 el lioncito con el mismo lefiador, diciendole que se fuera otra dia a la lefia, y el lioncito le contesta, "Gracias, amigo, que hoy si ya no ire contigo." Y se fueron marchindose. Ya el lioncito empez6 a quejarse a su madre diciendole que tenia muncha se(d) y la madre le contesta, "No, hijo, no vayas a tomar agua porque si no te va a ser malo." 13. THE HONEST WIFE (MUJUR HONRADA).1 When the mother of the groom went to ask for the girl from her mother, the mother of the girl said, "I think I can not give her, for my daughter is very young, a mere child." - "That is why I have come to get her." - "All right," said the reshgusan,2 "then come in eight days." When the eight days were over, the reshgusan agreed to the marriage. When the 1 Told by Miguel Meendes. 2 Parents and relations (of the bride).</page><page sequence="25">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 3 o0I son arrived from his voyage (i. e. trading trip), he said, "How was it ?" They answered, "Well, we went." - "What did the people say ?" - "They agreed to it." - "Well," said the mother of the groom, "now you will get married very soon." - "All right," said the boy, "I will not go on another trip, I will wait." Then the mother of the bride sent for the groom to see if indeed (si es cierto) he had asked for the bride. When the groom arrived four persons were there. Then he only said that his mother had sent him. They said that his mother was thinking of getting their daughter, although she was only a child. "All right," said the man, "because she is hija nifia, for that reason they sent me, my mother and father." - "Instead of bringing a present (regalo), instead of gyelnador,' better you marry," said the reshgusan. "All right," said the groom, "tomorrow early I will receive her." Sotheygot married. Theywere able to get married (ganaron el casamiento). Then said the mother and father of the girl, "Now you are going out of our care. Now you are getting married." "Now, little wife (esposita), you will stay with my mother, because I am going away." And he went on his trip. When he came back, he asked his mother how they had been and the mother answered that they had been well, nothing had happened. And the man was well satisfied. Then said the man to his wife, "Now, wife, I am going to sleep with you. You have been patient for a long time." And the wife said to him, "Very well, with much pleasure, since we have been blessed." His mother said to him, "Do not abuse your wife because she is not gross nor badly educated. She is very obedient." In three days he left again on a trip. When he came back, his father and mother were dead. When he arrived he said, "Where is Irena ?" for so the woman was called. Then said Irena, "You see your mother and father are dead and for that reason I am very sad." - "Well," said the man, "let us go and see where the grave is." When they arrived at the grave, the man said, "Ai papacito! mamacita !" Then he heard a voice saying to him, "When you left and we died, your wife, Irena, buried us here in coffins." Then he returned to his house and they ate breakfast. "Ai, little wife," said the peddler, "stay well, for tomorrow I am going again on a trip. I leave you with as much confidence as if you were my mother." (He had noticed on the leg of his wife a red mole, lunar colorado.) Hardly had he been gone two days, when there came a neighbor who was a tailor. He said to the woman, "How can you put up with a man who keeps leaving you, who is not satisfied to stay in one place with you?" The woman answered, "What does it matter, since my husband has left me with enough money ?" Then said the tailor, "If you agree, I could live with you. If you agree, let us be lovers." And the woman said, 1 To this party the groom contributes food and drink and the next day the couple begin to live together, without benefit of clergy.</page><page sequence="26">30 2 Yournal oJ American Folk-Lore. "No, I do not agree, it would be a sin if I agreed. Only my husband knows me. But if you wish, the day my husband comes I will tell him all you have been saying." Now the husband was very pensive, thinking of where his wife was and what she might be doing. When the servant saw his master so pensive, he said to him, "Patrdn, what are you thinking about ? If you are think- ing about your wife, better we return so she will be again in your control (en su poder). So the patr6n told the servants to go on alone, he would return alone. When he arrived in his house he had secured himself (segurado) with two candles. When he knocked at the door his wife was awake. She said, "Who is it ?" and her husband answered, "It is I." Then the wife said, "Why did you return ?" and the man answered that he had returned because he was thinking a lot about her. So the woman prepared supper. In a few minutes they ate supper. After supper the woman said, "Go and call the tailor para que no se apendejo (?) otra vez. He came to tell me that you are a man that can not support me and he proposed that I enter into a relation of love with him." The husband said, "But he did nothing to you ?" And the woman answered, "Nothing, you only know me." When they woke up the next day, he called the tailor. Then the peddler1 said to the tailor, "Why did you come to my house ?" The tailor said because he liked his wife very much, that is why he came to his house, and "from liking so much your wife my face is swollen ('sta hinchando mi cara). Then the peddler said to his wife. "Better we move from here, so I do not get involved with the tailor." Then they moved to another locality. But before long a neighbor who was a shoemaker came to make some shoes for the girl. Then the shoemaker said to her that he liked her very much and the girl answered, "What is there about me that you make this proposal to me? For such a thing we removed here." When the peddler arrived he said, "How did you get on ?" And the woman answered, "Well, except that a shoemaker fell in love with me." Then said the peddler, "If it is the shoemaker now, I will make a bet with him. After my (next) trip, if he does not win, I will strike off his head." So he called the shoemaker, saying to him, "I know you want to have relations with my wife; but let us make a bet. I have to undertake a long journey, if you have obtained nothing when I return from my journey I will behead you. And if you have won my wife, I will leave you all my money and mules." And the peddler went on his journey. The shoemaker was in his house when there came a good old woman to sell trompadas, alegrias, dulces. The old woman asked him to buy sweets, and the shoemaker answered sadly that he was not so inclined. And the old woman said, "Why are you sad ?" The shoemaker answered, "I am sad because of a contract that may lose me my head." So the old woman said, "Don't be troubled, Shoemaker, I will go to see the woman to make 1 He is referred to indifferently as viajero, "travelling man", or arriero.</page><page sequence="27">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mit/a, Oaxaca. 30 3 her agree to a relationship with you." So the old woman went to the house of the wife of the peddler. Two boys stood talking in the door. When the old woman arrived, she asked the boys what the sefiora was doing. They answered that she was bathing. The old woman gave a sweet to each boy so they would not tell the woman. She entered and saw the woman sitting in a tub (tina). The woman did not have time to get out, and the old woman saw the mole she had. Then the old woman went to the shoemaker and said to him, "Don't be troubled, the wife of the peddler has a mole on her right leg." When the peddler returned he called the shoemaker and said to him, "How did you make out ?" The shoemaker brought out a paper on which was drawn the mole of the wife of the peddler. Then the peddler said to his wife, "Here is the proof, and why did you tell me you were honest? Were you honest, the shoe- maker would not know about that mark." In anger the peddler went to the house of a carpenter to have him make a box the size of the woman. When the box was finished he said to his wife, "Ahora si, wife, instead of my killing you, you better get into this box." The wife obeyed and got into the box, and the peddler nailed it down. After he nailed it down, he delivered his money and mules to the shoemaker according to the contract he had made. On one mule he loaded the box and he left for the coast. When he reached the shore he took the box and threw it into the water. The peddler went on to where there were a jefe and juez. The judge said to him, "We have a case against you. Where is your wife ? Where are your mules? We know you have many mules and a wife." They seized him and made him prisoner. The box was in the high seas for five years. Then a sailor found it. When they opened it, they saw what appeared like the Virgen de la Soledad. The sailors knelt. "Do not kneel!" said the woman. "I am neither Virgin nor Saint. I am a sinner of this world." Then the woman arrived at an inn. There she bethought herself to dress as a man. Within three days there died there a secretary of the judge and the judge saw the woman and asked if she would accept the position of secretary. The woman agreed and entered the office of the judge. After two months of working for the judge they arrested the peddler and the woman recog- nized her husband. The judge said to the peddler, "Where is your wife ?" The peddler said that he had placed her in a box and thrown her into the sea. When the shoemaker came and the old woman, to make their declarations, the judge obliged them to return the mules and all the money the peddler had given, and then he had them put into a cask of oil. Then the peddler saw the secretary and thought that he looked like his wife. The judge said, "Now if you saw your wife, what would you do ?" - "I would take her to my house and we would live a happy life again." Then said the woman, "I am your wife. Now you see I was innocent. Had I been guilty, I would have died when you threw me into the water. But the sailors saved my life." Then the peddler said to the judge, "Do</page><page sequence="28">304 Lbournal of American Folk-Lore. me the favor to give me my wife." - "But it is not a woman. Do you not see that he is dressed in men's clothes ?" Then answered the secretary, "Yes, Sefior Judge, I am a woman. I dressed as a man because I had many enemies, and so I cut off my braids." The judge wondered to hear this. Then the peddler carried his wife to his pueblo. When they reached his house the wife said to her husband, "Now you see I was innocent and you believed I was culpable." The peddler begged her pardon, "Pardon, wife, now I see you are an honest woman." - "You see what became of the shoemaker and the old woman. If I were not your wife, you would be in the place of the shoemaker and the old woman. I would not dishonor you because of the affection I had for your reshgusan when they came to ask for me when I was a child. Now you see I am really honest." Then the peddler began to cry. "Now my husband, you are a peddler, go on with your trips, and do not think evil of me any more. I am really honest. Now we shall live together with satisfaction." Finished. 14. PEDRO AND JORGE.1 San Pedro was a viajero (peddler). He himself carried his pack, he had no animals. He was traveling when he met datgol (grandfather) Trinidad. He said to Pedro, "Pedro, if you go on traveling and carrying your pack, you will have only a few days to live. What you should do is to collect all your resources and buy a burro." And so Pedro went on to Tonold where he had a friend. This friend offered to supply him with merchandise, money and two burros, on condition of sharing his profits. Then Pedro returned on his road. He reached a hostelry (peraja). As he was a noisy rampageous fellow (griton escandoloso) he went whistling and yelling as do arrieros (donkey men) driving a large band of donkeys, when another band from Tusla with one hundred burros came along. Then Pedro came out the other side with only his two burros. They laid hold on him. "Cabrdn! Why did you shout that way? We thought you had a train of mules (requia de mulas)." Then Pedro went on his way. He arrived at a point near Mitla at a hostelry. When he arrived at this hostelry he encountered some other peddlers. They said, "Hurry, brother (Z., betse), your mother is very sick." So Pedro did not stop, but went all night until he reached his house. When he arrived his brother was crying, saying his mother was about to die. Pedro said to his brother, "Don't cry! What we should do is to heat some water for us to bathe our mother." But Jorge did not obey him. So Pedro took a jar of hot water and poured it over his mother. Then they saw that she was dead. Then said Jorge, "Pedro, you have killed our mother." Answered Pedro, "Keep your mouth shut! I know what to do. Take a burro and place our mother between the baskets. We will take her to Oaxaca for an operation." Jorge got the burro ready 1 Told by Miguel Mendes.</page><page sequence="29">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 30 5 and put their mother sitting between the two baskets. As Pedro was a rascal (muy pecaro) he said to Jorge, "Let us follow behind the burro and let him go into a field so the owner of the field may be the one to blame for our mother." They followed behind and let the burro go into the field of one who was a rough fellow. He began to beat the burro and the burro jumped and the woman fell to the ground. Then said Pedro, "Why have you killed my mother? Better had you let me pay for the damage done by the animal and not have killed my mother." And the owner of the field was frightened, thinking he had committed this crime, and he agreed to pay for the burial and give Pedro one thousand pesos so Pedro would not report him to the authorities. After their mother's funeral, Pedro and Jorge made ready to go on a journey. They reached a pueblo. Pedro said to Jorge, "With the money we have for our mother, let us see how we can arrange for the burro to carry all this money, and then we shall see how we can sell the burro." In the mesdn where they were Pedro managed to fasten the burro apart from the others, and he said to the keeper of the mesdn that he had a burro virtuoso for it dropped only gold. The next day the keeper of the mesdn went to see if this was so and in the dung he found pieces of gold. The keeper of the mesdn admired the burro and asked Pedro to sell it to him. Pedro asked three thousand pesos for the burro and the man paid the three thousand pesos believing what Pedro had said. Pedro and his brother went on their way. They arrived at a hostelry where they encountered the arrieros of the mule train. That night it began to rain, and Pedro put himself into a bag (bolsa) as he had no covers. The peddlers saw that he had a lot of money. They made a plan. "In the first sleep, let us get Pedro and his brother and throw them into the river so we can get their money." But as Pedro was very clever (listo) and saw the peddlers were sleeping, he gathered up all the leashes (reatas), garabatas and gamaras, and put them all into his bag and fastened it and made a sign to his brother to do the same with his bag. Then the two went across the river. When the peddlers woke up they looked for the bags and picked them up and threw them into the water. "Adios, Pedro !" Pedro answered on the other side, "Adios, reatas y lazos!" Then Pedro made a turn and found the packs of rope (bultos de reatas) being carried down by the current. He got them out of the river and took them to a nearby pueblo and began to change the reatas so they would not be recognized. Then they went back to the hostelry which the peddlers had not been able to leave because they had no ropes. When they saw Pedro they asked him what he was carrying. "I am carrying reatas and lazos which I have sold and am taking to those who bought them." The peddlers asked Pedro to sell them. Pedro agreed to sell them at a high price, and the peddlers paid his price. Pedro got his money and went on his way. They followed a trail and reached a mountain. At the foot of a tree were two boxes, some bottles</page><page sequence="30">306 7ournal of American Folk-Lore. and glasses. Pedro wondered at seeing these things under the tree. As it was late, they could not go farther, so Pedro bethought himself and said to his brother, "Let us fill the two boxes with little stones and climb up the tree with them. Look, Brother, be very alert, do not sleep this night. I do not know whether by morning we shall be dead or alive!" About two o'clock at night some bandits arrived at the foot of the tree. They made a fire and put down mats (petates). They carried six bags of money and they began to divide it up. Pedro saw all they were doing below. He took a little stone and when he saw the bandits lying down, taking their mescal and smoking, he dropped a stone, and it fell into the face of one of the robbers. The robber got up very angry, blaming his companions for throwing stones, and began to beat them, and they all began to fight. They fought until they were all killed but two. Then Pedro made a sign to his brother to drop the box on top of these two. He dropped the boxes on their heads and killed them. Then they loaded up the money and went to leave it in the house of a friend they trusted, and came on here. When they arrived here, after a few days, Pedro said to his brother, "Now it is time for us to go for the money we left in the house." - "No, brother, I will not go with you for you are a very bad man and I do not want to go with you. Now that God has been with me and I have arrived in our house, I will not go with you again. If you need the money, you can go and get it." Pedro was not satisfied and said, "But who will look after you now that our mother is dead? You should go with me." Jorge would not go. The same day came a patrdn seeking a servant to look after a thousand sows (marranas), and Pedro said he and his brother would look after the sows. They went to the house of the rico. They had been looking after the pigs for fifteen days when they met a cattleman (torinero) and the man offered to buy the pigs. Pedro agreed to sell them for 2500 pesos, all of them excepting tails and ears. Then said Jorge, "Pedro, the patrdn will kill us, now that youhave sold all the pigs." Pedro answered, "Don't be afraid, brother." Near where they were herding was a swamp and Pedro stuck in the tails and the ears. The swamp was almost in front of the house of the rico. Pedro said to Jorge, "Go to the house of the patrd6n and tell him all the pigs got into the swamp." When the patrdn heard this, he came running out. When he got there Pedro was pulling at a tail. Pedro put his hand down and held the tail. When the patrdn pulled, Pedro let go and the patrdn fell backwards. Then the patrdn said to Pedro, "Look, Pedro, better fetch three shovels and each of us will dig them out." Pedro went to get the shovels. When he got to the house of the patr6n, his wife and two daughters were standing in the door. Pedro said to the wife, "The patrdn sent me for us to go to bed, so that the pigs can get out of the swamp." -- "But how ?" said the sefiora. "What can I do ?" Pedro said, "That is what the patr6n said." She went to the road and called to her husband, "Que es cierto, que</page><page sequence="31">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 307 los tres? Do you really mean all three?" - "Si, hombre, hurry up!" After that Pedro left. When the patrdn returned his wife told him what had happened. Then the patrdn followed Pedro to kill him. When Pedro and Jorge heard him coming they changed into birds and they went up and up until they came to a big door and they entered. When they arrived they were standing in front of gyeb Dios, and God said, "Hombre Pedro, what a rascal you have been! Many abuses have you committed! But now I will pardon you all." He blessed him and changed him into a stone which became the door step (umbral) of the door of Heaven (puerta del cielo). 15. FAITHLESS WIFE.1 En un tiempo habia un muchacho que se llamaba Juan de la Carrera. Este Juan Carrera se habia casado. Despu4s de casarse le dijo a su esposa, "Si es que yo me muero primero tienes tu que enterrarte conmigo, y si t' te mueras me enterrare contigo." - "Bueno," dijo la mujer. Pero lleg6 un dia que la mujer se habia enfermado y a los pocos dias muri6. Cuando vi6 Juan que su esposa estaba muerta, empez6 a regalar todos sus intereses. Regal6 todo lo que tenia y empez6 a construir una b6veda (suterrAneo) en la iglesia. Y se prove6 de alimentos y s'enterr6 con su esposa, la muerta. Hacia un afio que estaba en la b6veda cuando oy6 el ruido de un ratoncito que iba a comer las tortillas que tenfa adentro. Entonces pens6 Juan una cosa, que iba a matar el ratoncito. Cuando vi6 el ratoncito que Juan ya lo querfa matar entonces dijo el ratoncito, "Juan, no me mates. Te voy a regalar una fortuna." - " i Que fortuna es ?" dijo Juan. "Te voy a regalar una rosa para que revivas a tu esposa." - "Bueno," dijo Juan. Se fue el ratoncito. Cuando regres6 ya tria la rosa y se la entreg6 a Juan. Y dijo, "Vas a pegarle tres veces a la nariz de tu esposa. Y ya verds tui como revive." Juan obedeci6 los consejos del ratoncito y fue a hacerlo como habia dicho. Y se revivi6 su esposa. Cuando la mujer abri6 los ojos y vi6 a Juan, entonces dijo, "Esposo mifo, jque tiempo hace que estoy dormiendo ?" - "Hija," dijo Juan, "ni yo recuerdo los tiempos que nos encontramos en esta tumba, pero yo ahora hare la posibilidad de buscar la manera de salirnos." Entonces Juan empez6 a dar golpes. Cuando oy6 un sacristan y se acerc6 a oir en que lugar eran los golpes. Cuando senti6 que era en el suelo, empez6 a excavar y fue a encontrarse en el lugar donde se encontraba Juan. Y le dijo, " Quien eras tui ?" --"Yo soy Juan de la Carrera que m' he enterrado con mi esposa ya hace tiempo y ya 'hora le doy las gracias de haberme abierto la fosa." Y se dispidi6 Juan del sacristan. Y se fue para su casa. Al llegar en su casa sus familias lo desconocieron. Va anduvo Juan mendigando para pasar el dfa. Cuando vi6 que no tenia esperanza ninguna se retir6 de su pueblo para otro pueblo cercano.

Y se sentaron a descansar. Entonces dijo Juan, "Descansare un rato sobre tus piernas para ver si puedo dormir un rato." - "Bueno," dijo la mujer. Y a los pocos momentos Juan se habia dormido. Ya serfa como unas cuatro horas que estaba dormido cuando pas6 un regimiento de infanteria que venia escoltando a un rey. Cuando 11egaron en el lugar donde estaban Juan y su mujer entonces vi6 el rey a la muchacha que era muy simpatica, hermosa, y se enamor6 luego de la muchacha. Y dijo la muchacha que no podia dejar a su esposo porque habia hecho un contrato. Y luego el rey le pregunt6 a la muchacha que cuMl era el contrato que tenia. Entonces dijo la muchacha, "Habia yo muerto durante unos cien afios y mi esposo se habia enterrado conmigo y asi es que no puede dejarlo." Y el rey le ofreci6 que se casaria con la muchacha y munchos riquezas hasta que pudo convencerla. Entonces dijo la muchacha, " IC6mo podre retirarme ?" Entonces dijo el rey, "Dejalo en el mismo lugar." Y levant6 una piedra, y fue a ponerla para que le sirviera de almohada. Y se retiraron para su reinado. La mujer muy feliz. En el lugar donde 'staba Juan 11eg6 un soldado que se habia quedado muy atras. Entonces despert6 a Juan, y le dijo, " iQue haces aqui, muchacho ?" Y Juan le contesta que se habia dormido en compafifa de su esposa. Y el soldado le dijo, "gAd6nde esta tu esposa?" Juan le contesta que no sabia. Entonces el soldado le dijo, "Tu esposa se ha 11evado el rey. Si quieres verla puedes seguirme y te ensefiare en el punto donde s'encuentra su esposa." Juan sin decir una palabra sigui6 el soldado. Ya habfan 11egado cerca de la ciudad cuando le dijo el soldado, "Juan, usted se va a incorporar a este regimiento para que asi puedes tu verla." Llegaron en la ciudad, y se present6 Juan al general. Dandole el grado como soldado primero a los pocos dias le toc6 de sentinela en el cuarto del rey, cuando 11eg6 su esposa y lo vi6. En el momento di6 la vuelta. Y se habfa quejado con el rey diciendole por que habfa dado lugar a que su esposo Juan esta de sentinela. Y el rey muy asombrado le dijo, que no sabia. Y la muchacha le dijo, "Si no matas a ese hombre, no podrt estar a gusto en tu compafifa." En los mismos momentos el rey pens6 unos planes, diciendole a Juan que dejara su uniforme y que fuera a un mandado. Mientras el rey fun a ponerle una sortija de oro en las bolsas de uniforme. A los pocos momentos despues lleg6 Juan, se visti6 y sigui6 en el lugar indicado. Dando las seis empez6 a buscar la sortija. Y luego se dirigi6 a Juan diciendoles que Juan podrifa ser un ladr6n. Y Juan lo negaba, que nunca en su vida conocfa lo que es robar. Pero el rey empez6 a registrar las bolsas y fue a encontrar la sortija. Y luego le dijo, " C6mo me dices que no eres ladr6n, y ste porque lo habfas robado ?" Luego mand6 a 11amar una escolta dici~ndoles que lo 11evaran para el fusilamiento. Viendo Juan que no podia salvarse 11am6 a su amigo y le</page><page sequence="33">Zapoteca and Spanisk Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 309 dijo, "Amigo mio, me llevan a fusilamiento, pero te voy a dejar esta rosa que a los tres dias de mi entierro vendris tu a abrir mi sepultura. Y me pondras esta rosa tres veces en mi nariz. Si acaso revivo nos iremos para otra reinado." Se despidi6 de su amigo y se fue para el pante6n. Hicieron el fusilamiento, enterarron a Juan y se retiraron para el cuartel. A los tres dias en la noche fue el soldado que era el amigo de Juan a excavar la sepultura, haciendole como Juan le habia dicho. En el instante revivi6, y despues se dieron los fuertes abrazos por el bien que habia hecho. Despues del fusilamiento se fueron los dos hombres para donde Dios les ayudara. Ya habia caminando muy lejos, cuando se habia devisado una ciudad. Entonces dijo Juan al muchacho, " iAd6nde sert ese punto ?" - "Hermano," dijo el otro, "iremos a esa ciudad. Esa ciudad es muy grande y alla podremos pasarnos la vida." Llegaron en la ciudad, estos dos hombres, muy desalifiados, sucios, muy pobres. Al fin empezaron a andar en el pueblo curando a la gente. En &amp;sa s'encuentro una sefiora anciana y le dice, "Sefiores, ?no habian ustedes sabido que la hija del rey habia muerto ?" Y Juan le habia contestado, "Si pudiera decir al rey que yo pudiera revivir a la nifia." Y l'anciana sin decir una palabra luego regres6 a avisarle al rey diciendole, "Sefior Rey, alla encontre a dos hombres que me dicen si usted pudiera darles el permiso que ellos pasaran aqui en su casa ellos pudieran revivir a la nifia." Y el rey le dijo, "gAd6nde estin esos hombres?" - "Sefior," le dijo la sefiora, "los hombres estin en mi casa." Luego mand6 a llamar una escolta diciendoles, "Se van en compafiia de esta sefiora para traerme dos hombres que 'stan alli en su casa que dicien que son dotores." Lleg6 la escolta en la casa de la sefiora. Entonces le dijo, "Sefiores, ustedes se van con nosotros por el orden del rey." Y Juan le contesta, "iPor que sera eso, Sefior ?" - "El rey lo llama, y no sabemos para que." Se fueron. Al llegar en la casa del rey cuando se habia visto, le dijo, " Que van a ser dotores estos hombres perdidos? Ni aqui que hay buenos dotores no pudieron sanar a mi nifia. Que van a poder esos indios ?" Juan le dijo. "Dame el permiso, tan siquiera un momento para ver a la nifia." Entonces el rey dijo, "Si tui no comples lo que has prometido isabes tfi que te voy a fusilar ?" - "Con mucho gusto, Sefior. Estoy a sus ordenes," dijo Juan. "Pero dime el permiso de ver a la nifia." El rey di6 el permiso. Entr6 Juan adentro, se acerc6 a la muerta, mand6 cerrar las puertas, quedando solo adentro. Sac6 la rosa de la bolsa, le peg6 la primera vez en la nariz de la nifia. A la segunda, la nifia ya se movi6. A la tercera que habia pegado la rosa en la nariz, abri6 los ojos y suspir6. Luego pidi6 un vaso de agua. Entonces Juan mand6 pidir l'agua. Despues que habia tomado el agua, se levant6 y empez6 a andar. Cuando vi6 su padre luego le di6 unos fuertes abrazos diciendoles, "Hija mia, que tu eres, yo crefa que nunca ya mas volveria a verte, pero ahora que este joven te ha revivido te casar s con 61. Y el serd el primer rey, y yo, su segundo." Y diciendo a Juan, "Tdi que has revivido a mi hija en recompensa de tus favores te 21</page><page sequence="34">3 10o ournal of American Folk-Lore. entregard mi trono, que seras tui el primer rey y yo su segundo." Y le dijo Juan, "No, Sefior, no vengo a quitarle su corona, ni vengo a impulsar a usted de su puesto." Con mil siplicas acept6 Juan. A los dos dias luego se cas6 Juan y el rey l'entreg6 la corona. Celebr6 una fiesta muy grande en honor del Juan. Luego el rey mand6 a 11amar todos los reyes de los otros reinados para recibir el nuevo rey. En esas reuniones lleg6 el rey que vivia con la esposa de Juan. Ya estaban todos los reyes reunidos en un cuarto. Entonces se par6 Juan en medio de todos diciendoles, "Sefiores, yo soy de un tal punto que tenia una esposa que tanto que nos queriamos hicimos el juramento que el primero que se muere se tiene que enterrarse junto." Y entonces refiri6 todos los pasajes que habia sufrido con su esposa y el rey.1 Entonces les dijo a los invitados, " Que podria hacer con ese ?" Y todos los reyes gritaron, "Un hombre de esa clase se necesita echarle en uno cazo de aceite hirviendo, 61 y la mujer. Y asi lo hicieron. Eso lo vi, Despues de todo Me vine. 16. DIVIDING FOR THE ANIMALS: ENCHANTED HORSE.2 There were three boys, one called Juan, the other Pedro, the other Jose. They were poor and Juan and Pedro said to their father, "We are pobrecitos, let us go to another pueblo to work." And Jose heard what his two brothers were doing. He said, "Papacito, I am going with my brothers to work, to make money and buy clothes so I can marry too." And Jose followed his two brothers. And they said to him, "Andavete, andavete! Get away! How can we take you along ?" And they scolded him. But Jose followed them at a distance. And Jose found a golden apple and showed it to his brothers. They took it from him, and he cried and cried until they gave it back to him. And Jose came to a river where a horse stood fastened and he said, "Whose horse is this? It might be for me." He took the horse and came to a pueblo and asked for shelter (posada). There came his brothers and took the golden apple from his bag. Jose cried and cried. His horse asked, "Why are you crying? Your two brothers took your golden apple." So he asked his brothers for the apple and they gave it back to him. His two brothers said, "Let us see how we can kill Jos." They went to Sir King and said, "There is a country man of ours (paisano) who says he will place a golden apple at the door of the room where you sleep." The king gave them soldiers to go and get Jose. Sefior Rey asked Jose, "Is it true that you said you would place a golden apple at the door of my sleeping room ?" He cried and 1 I. e. the whole story is retold. 2 Told by Rosa Santiago.</page><page sequence="35">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 3 1 cried and went to his horse. "Why do you cry ?" - "Sir King says that he will kill me unless I place the golden apple at the door of his sleeping room." The horse said, "We may die, but Sir King will not kill us. Mount me and let us go!" - "Yes," said the boy and he mounted and at a distance of from here to the house of Manuel Quero they saw a mirror and a bottle. Said the horse, "Get the mirror and bottle and let us run." Behind them came a whirlwind (molinino), but it did not overtake them. They came to where was a dead burro. Fighting over it were eagles, ants, lions, rabbits, deer, all the animals. They divided the meat and gave it to all the animals. The eagle gave him a little feather, the lion gave him a hair, the deer gave him a hair. His brothers go again to Sir King and say, "There is a fellow country- man who says he would like to plant a golden lettuce." The king sent for him. "Is it true that you would like to plant a golden lettuce? If not, I am going to kill you." He went to his horse and began to cry. The horse told him to plant the bottle that was the golden lettuce. The brothers passed by and saw it. "Now let us kill him," they said, "since he will not, give us his golden apple. Let us go to Sir King and tell him that there is a fellow countryman who says he will bring him all the animals of the mountains." So the king sent for him. "Did you say that you would bring me all the animals of the mountains? If not, I will kill you." He went to his horse and cried again. "Why do you cry ?" - "Why should I not cry when the king says I am to bring him all the animals of the mountains ? " The horse said, "Dejalo! Let us go!" So they killed a bull and all the animals of the mountains came to eat it. And the king was frightened by so many animals, so frightened that he would not leave his house. Passed by the brothers and said, "Let us kill him now! Let us tell the king that he says he will bring him a French woman at the end of the world (Frances(a) al f/in del mundo)." The king sent for him. "Is it true that you said that you would bring me a French woman at the end of the world." - "No, Sir King!" - "Yes, you said so. Bring her to me, else I will kill you." He cries and goes to his horse. The horse says, "Go to the king and ask him for a letter to the French woman at the end of the world." The king wrote the letter and the boy left with his horse. They meet a little fox fastened to a stake. The boy sets him free. Says the little fox, "If you had not set me free, I would have died. I have only a hair to give you." They come to the sea. A little fish is lying up on the shore. The boy throws him back into the water. Says the little fish, "Thank you! If you had not thrown me into the sea, I would have died." The little fish gives him a scale. They come to the sea. Says the horse, "When we are in the middle of the sea, beat me hard. Take two bottles and fill them with my sweat." They come to where they divided the burro for the animals. He mounts the eagle and they fly to the moon rise. They sleep the first night. They come to the sea. He began to beat his little horse. He filled the two bottles with the sweat. The horse turned into a 21"</page><page sequence="36">3 12 5'ournal of American Folk-Lore. catrino.1 The catrino said, "When you come to the king's house, fill the bath with hot water and drop in some pearls. Your two brothers will come. Tell them there are pearls in the water. When they look into the water, push them in." (Unfinished). 17. CUBICUBIANA.2 There was a man married to a woman and they had one daughter, Cubicubiana. And they came to ask for her; but her parents would not accept. So Cubicubiana and the boy agreed to run away. Cubicubiana took with her the three things her godmother had given her - a comb, some maguey fibre,3 and a mirror. And Cubicubiana before she left spat into a jar for the spittle to speak for her. At night when her mother called her, "Cubicubiana!" the spittle answered, "Yes, sefiora madre, I am coming." Her mother called again, "Cubicubiana!" "Yes, sefiora madre, I am coming." This time the answer was less loud, as they were getting farther away. Again her mother called, "Cubicubiana!" "Yes, sefiora madre, I am coming!" The answer they could hardly hear. The next time the mother called, "Cubicubiana!" there was no answer. "They have gone," said her mother and told her father to go after them. He got on his horse and went. When they saw him coming, Cubicubiana threw down the comb and it turned into a palisade. He could not get through it and turned back. "Que tonto, fool!" said her mother, "Go after them again." When they saw him after them, Cubicubiana threw down the estropaja and it turned into a thicket and he turned back. "Que tonto i" said her mother who was a witch, "this time I will go." Cubicubiana threw down the mirror and it turned into a lake. When the mother came up she could not get across and she put a curse upon them. They reached the house of the groom and they got married. But at the wedding all the food they gave them turned into zacate, husks. That was the malediction of her mother, and they had to return to her mother to beg her pardon. From that we see that children must obey their parents. 18. THE SUITOR TESTED.4 There was a boy called Juan Pelotera. He met the daughter of the Diablo. He said, "Is it true he is a good ball player ?" - "Yes." - "I too am somewhat of a player." Juan played against the devil. Juan won 1 The Mitleyeno term for citified person. Language and manners, partic- ularly clothes, are in mind, rather than race. I never heard the term mestizo used at Mitla. The general Mexican term for Spaniard, Gachupin, is not unfamiliar, but the distinction between Indian and non-Indian is regularly conveyed by this term catrino. 2 Told by Angelica Quero who heard it from her grandfather, Felix Quero. 3 Estropaja, the fibre (isle) is called after it has been cleaned and pounded ready for twining. Estropaja is used as a bath brush. ' Told by Rosa Santiago.</page><page sequence="37">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 3 from the devil. Said the devil to Juan, "You may marry my daughter for you are a very good player." Then Juan came to where the three girls were, and Juan asked them where the devil was and they showed Juan where the devil was sleeping. The devil sent Juan to plant orange trees, lemon trees, watermelons, melons and corn, and to make a well. Of the three girls Juan liked the smallest one the best. She brought Juan his breakfast and Juan said, "What am I going to do now? Your father wants me to plant orange trees, lemon trees, watermelons, melons and corn, and to make a well." Said the girl, "Eat breakfast, Juan, don't cry, don't think about it! In a little while I am going to do the things my father sent you to do. When you go you will bring them all ripe to my father and don't tell him I did it, and if he asks if you did it say yes." Then Juan arrived with ears of green corn, watermelons, melons and apples, and he had finished making the well. He said to the devil, "Now I have won, Papa." Next day the devil said, "Now you are to make a bridge. Make a good one!" When the girl arrived with Juan's breakfast, Juan said. "What am I going to do? I can't build this bridge. There is nothing but mountains." - "Don't cry!" said the girl. "In a little while I will make this bridge. Eat breakfast! Only don't look at where I am working." And Juan did not see where she was working, he did not turn his head. She carried a belt of her mother. She threw it and it made a big bridge, and a big road in the mountain. "Wait here a little until I return. Then go, but do not say that I made the bridge." When Juan returned to his father-in-law he said, "Now I have won, Papa." "Yes, Son," he said. "Tomorrow early let us see what work you will do." Next day the devil called his friends to see the bridge Juan had made, and to come to Juan's wedding. That night Juan said to the girl, "What shall we have to do tomorrow ?" - "Tomorrow my mother will throw a cup of chocolate into the water and tell you to get it out." - "Now I won't be able to win at that." The girl said, "Look, Juan, take a piece of flesh from my finger and be careful that not a bit of it fall into the water when my mother throws in the chocolate." But a little piece did fall into the water. When they were sitting at the table, Juan came with the cup of chocolate to his father-in-law and the girl said, "How did you come to let a piece fall into the water ?" - "I don't know how a piece of your finger fell into the water. Let it alone. More flesh will grow on your finger." --"Tomorrow my father will put us into a room for you to choose one of us and from the missing flesh on my finger you will know which I am." Next day he put the three girls into a room and said to the padrino and madrina of the girls, "Now Juan will tell us which girl showed him how to plant, how to build the bridge, and how to extract the chocolate." The girls showed their hands. Of the first Juan said, "Not that one!" Of the second, Juan said, "Not that one!" Of the third Juan said, "That is the one I am to marry." They were glad to have her marry him for he was a valiant man.</page><page sequence="38">3 4 )tournal of American Folk-Lore. 19. THE ENvIous SISTERS.1 There were three girls and a king and one of the girls said, "Ojalai! I would like to marry the candy maker (dulcero) of Sir King to eat the kind of sweets Sir King eats." The second girl said, "Ojalai! I would like to marry the baker of Sir King to eat the bread Sir King eats." The third girl said she would like to marry Sir King himself. The girl who said she would like to marry Sir King married the king and she had a child. He was a little Christian (cristianito), but they showed a little lamb to Sir King and the two sisters said, "See what kind of a son you have!" Said Sir King, "Dejalo, it is my wife's misfortune." Then his wife had another child, and they showed Sir King a little cat. They put the two children into a box and threw it into the water. The woman had another child and they showed a little dog to Sir King. They said, "See what kind of an infant your wife has had!" Said the king, "Now three times has this happened to my wife. Now she is to go to prison." They had put the infants into a box and thrown them into the water. An old woman lived where the water carried the boxes. She got out the infants and nursed them. When they grew larger she told them how they had come there. The little boy (hombrecito) found a gun, the other boy, a sling, and the little girl (mujercita) a mirror. "Mamacita," said the boy, "I am going to the crystalline water, the tree that sings, and the bird that talks. I will leave you this gun and if it breaks I am not coming back. If it does not break, I am coming back." He met an old man. "Listen, son, where are you going?" - "I am not going anywhere." - "I know where you are going. Child, you are going to the crystalline water, the tree that sings, and the bird that talks." - "Yes." - "Well, at the mountain you will reach they will begin to whistle, to cry, to sing. Do not turn your head!" When he reached the place they began to whistle and cry and sing and he turned his head and he staid there as a stone. Then departed the other boy. He said, "Little grandmother, I leave my sling, if it breaks I am not coming back." He met the old man who said, "Child, where are you going?" - "I am not going anywhere." - "I know where you are going, to the crystalline water, the tree that sings and the bird that talks. Look, child, when you come to the mountain where they whistle and cry and sing, do not turn your head. Your brother did it and he did not return." When he came to where they whistled and cried and sang he looked back and he turned to stone. Said the girl "Little grandmother, I leave you this mirror. If it breaks I will not come back. If it does not break, I shall come back." She met the same old man. "Child, where are you going ?" - "I am going to the crystalline water, the tree that sings, and the bird that talks." - "When you come to where your two brothers are, when they begin to whistle and cry and sing, do not turn your head. If you turn your head, you will not 1 Told by Rosa Santiago.</page><page sequence="39">Zapoteca and Spanish Tales of Mitla, Oaxaca. 315 come back." When the girl reached the place where they were whistling and crying and singing, she tore her apron into pieces and stuffed them into her ears so as not to hear the noise. She reached the crystalline water and stood at a stone and said, "I want to take some of the crystalline water." She carried a bottle and she got the crystalline water, and then the tree that sings and the bird that talks. When she returned she sprinkled the water from her bottle drop by drop on the stones and her brothers appeared and said, "Did you reach the crystalline water and the tree that sings and the bird that talks ?" - "I met an old man, he gave me advice and so I reached the crystalline water, the tree that sings andthe bird that talks." And on their return journey they met the old man again and he said, "Look, child, you did not turn your head and so you were able to get the crystalline water, the tree that sings and the bird that talks." - "Deja, papacito, deja, thanks to God our little sister reached there." When they returned to their grandmother she said, "You have returned ?" - "Yes, mamacito, we have returned and now let us plant here!" From the tree their sister carried they made a garden, a big, big garden. They brought calabazitos to their house and inside were pearls and gold. "See, little grandmother, go to the king and tell him to come and see these plants, and the garden and lake we have here." The king came and the bird began to tell how these were his children. "Listen, children, what is your bird saying ?" They said, "He is saying how we came here, but that we have a father and mother. You are our father, Sir King. Our mother is in prison, for when we were born her sisters showed you a lamb and a little cat and a little dog. Now our mother is in prison and she is very weak. Now do us the favor of taking out our mother." He sent to take their mother out of prison and he gave a lot of money to the little grandmother because she had brought them up. 20. BALDHEAD.1 There was a boy called Pel6n, Baldhead, travelling along the road and the padre met him and asked what time would he arrive at the pueblo. Said Baldhead, "If you go running you will arrive; if you go slowly you will arrive." - "I will go running," said the padre. The padre did not arrive until the next day. Said the padre, "That Baldhead will have to live with me." When the padre returned he came slowly. When he reached the place where Baldhead was, he said, "Now Baldhead, you are to come and work for me." The padre arrived at his curato with Baldhead. Said the padre, "Now go on an errand to the cook and without saying anything, tell her to get breakfast." Baldhead got his top and went to where the cook was, playing the top and saying, "Anda trompito ! Anda trompito !" The padre was very vexed, he wanted breakfast. The 1 Told by Rosa Santiago.</page><page sequence="40">3 16 ournal of American Folk-Lore. cook said, "What are you doing, Baldhead ?" - "Nothing, only playing." The padre ate breakfast. When he woke up the next day he said, "Go and bring half of something and half of nothing (media de hay y media de no hay)." Baldhead got two baskets and found some old thorns (Z., giech gol) and put them in one of the baskets. When he came back the padre said, "What are you carrying ?" - "Padre, you told me to bring half of something and half of nothing." Baldhead won from the padre. Next day the padre told Baldhead, "Look, tomorrow early go and milk my bull." "Yes," said Baldhead. Baldhead went to where the bull was and waited there for the padre. He said, "Padre, padre, now I am going, for my father wants to give birth to his child." - "How is your father going to give birth to a child ? It is your mother who will give birth." - "Ai, padre, but you told me to milk this bull." - "Now you have won," said the padre. 21. PADRE, CANTOR, AND SACRISTAN.1 There was a girl and she went to confess to the padre. The padre said to her, "Hija, ja 'sta muy perdonada, I am going to marry you." Said the girl, "I will marry, ja estas muy bien perdonada." Out comes the sacristan and says, "My daughter, ja 'sta muy perdonada, I am going to marry you." Said the girl to her husband, "Listen to what the padre said, 'I am going to marry you,' and I am already married." Said her husband, "Is it true you love me a great deal ?" She said yes, she loved him a great deal. "Well, if you love me, say to the padre that he is to give you six hundred pesos and to the cantor say that he is to give you four hundred pesos and to the sacristan say that he is to give you two hundred pesos. And tell the padre to come at 9 o'clock, and the cantor at Io o'clock, and the sacristan at II o'clock. And you will hide the padre and the cantor and the sacristan put next your bed stand." After all this, the husband arrived and said, "Maria, Maria, I have come! I want supper. I want chili." Bring the basket of piquante. Go and bring the fire fibre (pasle de lumbre) and he set fire to the chili. The smoke was suffocating to the padre. The husband said, "Go and open the window for there is a lot of smoke in the room." The padre and the cantor went out by the window saying, "What has happened ? What has happened ?" Said the husband, "Now we have a lot of money. Cogimos de goro(?) Let us go to the church to see what the padre will say." Said the padre, "Que prendensiosa llegd Maria."' Said the cantor, "De te bolsa y de la mia."' Said the sacristan, "Mi cabeza servid de candelero."2 1 Told by Rosa Santiago. Cp.

THE DEVIL AND THE WOMAN.1 There was a poor man going along the road when he met the Devil. "What would you like?" asked the Devil. "Some money," said the man. "I will give you money," said the Devil. "Every time you put your hand in your pocket, you will find money; but I will impose one condition. Every day I will come to your house and ask for work. The day you have no work to give me, I will carry you to Hell." - "All right," said the man. He felt in his pocket and there was money. Now the man got married. Every day the Devil came to his house and every day he gave him some work - to build a wall, to mend the roof, jobs of all kinds. Finally his wife asked him, "Who is this seiior that comes every day to work?" - "It is a seiior I have to give work to every day." Finally there was no more work to be done and the rich man was very sad. "Why are you sad ?" asked his wife. "I will tell you," he said. "The seior who comes every day is the Devil, and tomorrow when he comes and I have no work to give him, he will carry me off." - "Don't worry," said his wife. "Tomorrow when he comes, hide and let me talk to him." - "All right," said her hus- band, knowing that women were more astute than men. So the next day her husband hid and the woman spoke to the Devil. "The work for you today is to straighten out this hair," she said and she pulled a hair from her armpit. The Devil took the hair and went away. Later in the day the woman and her husband were going along when they met the Devil sitting on the roadside pulling at the hair. He pulled and he pulled. He wet it in his lips and it became still more curly. "Hurry up!" said the woman, "and get it straight, for there are many more for you to straigh- ten," and she raised both her arms. That so frightened the Devil that he threw down the hair and ran away and never came back to ask for more work. 23. THE Gachupin AND THE NEGRO.2 There was a gachupin3 who was very pretentious. He came to a house and asked posada. There was one room, and two beds in it. In one bed was lying a negro. The gachupin looked at him. "How ugly!" he said, "But if I have to sleep here, I have to. Call me early in the morning, I have to get a train." The negro heard him, and during the night when the gachupin was asleep he got up and with some sapolin4 painted his face black. When the gachupin was called in the morning and got up and looked at himself in the mirror he called out to the master of the house, "Eh, friend! You called the negro instead of calling me!" 1 Told by Rafael Toro. 2 Told by Angelica Quero who heard it from a member of the Bishop's party during a recent episcopal visit. 3 Spaniard. 4 A black German paint used on furniture.</page></plain_text>
