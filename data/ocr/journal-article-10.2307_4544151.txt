MATTHEWS. THE problem of the " definition " of religion has engaged the attention of philosophers and others for a long time, but it would be bold to maintain that any great fruit has yet been gathered as a result of these labours. The attempt at definition has been made from many standpoints, from that of anthropology, of psychology and of sociology, as well as from that of philosophy properly so called. It must be confessed that a review of these essays in definition is somewhat depressing, ranging as they do from Solomon Reinach's dictum that " religion is a sum of scruples which impede the free use of our faculties," to Mattbew Arnold's " forality touched with emotion." We feel about most of these definitions that they do not answer the question which we really have in mind, though they may answer some subsidiary questions; they are one-sided and abstract and hence do not lay bare the essential nature of religion nor reveal the motive which inspires the religious development of mankind. The only writers who have faced the true problem presented by religion are those who, like Hegel and Croce, have attempted to show its place, its inevitable place, in the general development of mind. Even though we may decide perhaps that religion is not a permanent " form " of the spirit, or more drastically opine with Mr. Russell that it is based upon persistent illusions, yet that form is so inveterate and those illusions so continuous that we cannot reasonably assign them to the surface of the psyche or the fortuitous play of the intelligence, but are impelled to seek for them a foundation in the life and being of mind. At any rate I shall not spend your time on discussions s</page><page sequence="2">178 W. R. MATTHEWS. of an anthropological or psychological character but seek to gain some philosophical insight into the nature of religion. It is widely recognised that one of the most important contributions to the problem of the nature of religion was made by Schlenimacher, who has been described with some reason as the " founder of modern theology." In his famous formula, "religion is a feeling of absolute dependence." We may perhaps venture to set out from this definition in the hope that by criticism we may be led more deeply into the nature of religion. It is frequently forgotten that Schlenimacher's view is not completely summed up in the memorable phrase; two further points of great importance are added in the full statement of his theory which is worked out in der christliche Glaube, where he attempts to show that all self-consciousness is accompanied by" God consciousness," and that the development of the latter is linked with, and proceeds along with, the growth of consciousness of unity with the race and with the whole natural order. The value of this conception of the nature of religion lies in the fact that it attempts to show that the religious conscious- ness is an inherent and necessary quality of the human con- sciousness as such. There are nevertheless defects in Schleni- macher's formulation which have been frequently pointed out. Three seem to be of special importance: (a) Schlenimacher's reaction from the moralism of Kant, on the one hand, and from orthodox intellectualism on the other, led him, at least in the earlier phase of his thought, to lay an excessive, if not exclusive, emphasis on " feeling." To some extent this defect was modified in his later work, but it is not possible to absolve him altogether from the charge of neglecting the close connexion between the religious consciousness and moral and intellectual development. (b) Secondly, connected with the defect already noticed, is the more serious one that he suggests a passive conception of</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION AS INTERPRETATION. 179 the religious consciousness. The feeling of absolute dependence, in its pure form, would appear to preclude the experience of co-operation which has played a large part in many forms of religion. By passing over this element Schlenimacher has obscured a paradoxical feature of religion which it is important to keep clearly before our minds. In the religious attitude we find a 'combination of two attitudes which, at first sight, are contradictory, on the one hand that the Divine is the source of all power and good, and on the other that it needs and requires our help. Dependence is balanced by co-opera- tion. (c) Thirdly, we must needs recognise the truth in the con- tention of Professor Rudolph Otto that Schlenimacher's view fails to reckon with an essential ingredient of the religious sentiment, that feeling which Otto calls the "numinous," always present in any experience which we can describe as religious, and leading to the conception of God as transcendently " other" and mysterious. We have not merely the sense of dependence but a sense of awe of that on which we depend. In spite of these criticisms, however, I would maintain that Schlenimacher is essentially right, and would suggest some amendment of his view which may perhaps avoid some of the difficulties raised. The word " dependence " is not the whole truth, though it is a partial expression of the real situation. The experience which lies at the root of religion, as of all the spiritual activity of man in the widest sense, is an intuition of continuity. The self realises itself as continuous with a realty which is nevertheless " other " than it. Yet, though other, this reality is affirmed as not wholly other, but rather in some sense akin to the self. If we are in search of a compendious phrase to denote the " feeling " or intention, perhaps we shall scarcely improve on one which we owe to the late Emile Boutroux "the Beyond which is within."</page><page sequence="4">180 W. R. MATTHEWS. This sense of continuity with a " beyond the self " which is not completely alien to the self appears to me to be quite plainly a permanent characteristic of religion in all its forms, and its reality might be illustrated from every stage of religious develop- ment. To elaborate this contention in detail would be needlessly wearisome. Let us take religion at its most childlike expression and at its most mature. In both we shall hear the same under- tone. The animist and polytheist assuredly finds his divinity outside himself, an object of which account has to be taken; but nevertheless it is an essential part of this primitive creed, or rather of the mental attitude which underlies it, that the divine beings are, in some way, akin to themselves, with com- prehensible motives and "all-too-human " passions. At the other end of the scale stands, perhaps we may allow, the mystic theist, a Plotinus or an Augustine. What is his consuming ambition ? To rise, in an experience which transcends discursive thought, to a Being who is indeed far other than himself, and yet a Being in whom he knows that he will find his completion and his home. This sense of continuity with an " other " which is not alien to the self is not, of course, sufficient by itself to differentiate the religious consciousness from other aspects of man's spiritual life. On the contrary, it is common to them all and is, in fact, the germinal situation from which all intellectual, aesthetic and moral activity springs. Throughout the whole of our life as minds we are confronted with an " other " which responds, or is believed to respond, to our efforts to come to terms with it in various ways. Religion is one of the ways in which we seek to come to terms with that other, and in " coming to terms " we include " interpret." It is often said that religion is essentially an anthropomorphic method of interpreting reality, and the statement is undoubtedly true; but anthropomorphism is a characteristic which it shares with every other form of the spirit.</page><page sequence="5">RELIGION AS INTERPRETATION. 181 The possibility of any knowledge of " nature, " of any science, depends upon the assumption that the " other " responds to, is really interpretable by, the categories of our thought. If the phrase may be pardoned, it rests upon the conviction that the beyond is in some sense akin. There is no way of proving that this conviction is true. It is plainly not, in its origin, a working hypothesis, and I prefer to believe that this ineradicable conviction is the expression of a fundamental intention. I hope it needs no argument to show that the scientific interpretation of the world is thoroughly anthropomorphic, or " anthropic," if the word be preferred. The great authority of Professor Eddington might be cited in support of the thesis; but it needs no authority, for it is sufficiently evident that he who seeks to employ categories which are not human must first cease to be a man. An interesting illustration is furnished by some of the latest developments of physics. The category of " thing " or " substance " seems to be vanishing from the stage, and its place is being taken by more dynamic conceptions among which we may reckon " event." The attempt is now being made to envisage the external world as an interrelated series or system of events. An " event," however, is just as much an " anthropic " conception as " cause." It arises from the fact that attention is not continuous but proceeds, as it were, in spasms, and that human attention has a time span which forms a " specious now." By " event " we mean, in the last resort, an experience which for some consciousness, possibly an ideal one, would constitute a " specious now." The object of these remarks is not in the least to depreciate the value of scientific knowledge; on the contrary, the present writer deplores the tendencies to philosophical scepticism which are prevalent in writers on the new physics; the advance of scientific knowledge is indeed an advance in our knowledge of the real world, but only on one condition-that we rely upon the germinal</page><page sequence="6">182 W. R. MATTHEWS. intuition of our continuity with an " other " which is not alien to us but responsive. Science is one mode of interpretation of the object, and it is worth while here to write down summarily its salient charac- teristics in order that we may compare them with those of other modes. The scientific mode is essentially analytical, and it proceeds by the way of simplification and abstraction. As has often been said, its ideal is to reduce all its subject-matter to the calculable; and, since only real units can be counted, to see the world as a system of measurable relations between countable x's. The most elementary form of knowledge, however, illustrates the point which I am perhaps unduly labouring better than any discussion of the nature of science. In perception we meet the same basic condition of experience. We perceive the room in which we are now assembled; it is an " other," an object; if it were not an other there would be no knowledge of it, for there would be nothing to know; but equally, in the act of perception, it ceased to be wholly other and has come within our consciousness-" a beyond which is within." But elementary perception and the intellectual construction which grows out of it-natural science, are not the only forms of the spirit. We must try to indicate how the other forms of the spirit exemplify the principle which we are defending. Every form of the life of spirit is, regarded from one point of view, an interpretation of the other in terms of the person or of some element within the person; from another point of view it is an essay towards eliciting a response from the " beyond the self." Asthetic experience is a form of the spirit no less fundamental than that of science. I must reject the view, which I understand to be held by Croce, that art comes before nature in this matter and that we find beauty in nature because we have first found it in art. If that were true, it would be</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION AS INTERPRETATION. 183 difficult to understand how art should ever begin. On the contrary, we find beauty in art because we have first found it in nature, and the effort of the artist is to perpetuate a momentary revelation. This experience of natural beauty is surely best described as that of a suddenly disclosed kinship with ourselves; we feel that we, at that instant, have understood that other, but it is an understanding of the emotions and, as such, can never be expressed in concepts, it is a felt fellowship rather than a rationalized relation. But " nature " in that experience is not melted into mere subjectivity; and indeed the sesthetic revelation would lose all its force if we became convinced that the object of our contemplation was an illusion or a dream. Nature remains a " beyond," an " other " than ourselves, yet now felt as somehow continuous with and akin to ourselves, a "beyond that is within." Fichte elaborated the concept of the objective world as a sphere of moral activity, its existence being, as it were, posited by the Ego as the necessary condition of the development of the moral will. This moralist theory of being is plainly the expres- sion of a genuine aspect of the life of spirit. The world is for us not only a series of percepts, or an object of cesthetic enjoyment, but a realm in which purposes are to be fulfilled and ideals realised. The moral consciousness, it must be confessed, at first sight is the most difficult to fit into our fundamental scheme of the life of the spirit as interpretation. It seems here to be a primary requisite of the " beyond " and the " other " that it should not be akin or continuous with the self. It is indeed precisely because the objective world does not conform to our ideals that the life of moral effort has meaning. It lives upon the contrast between ideal and actual, and if this vanishes it vanishes too. To me this undeniable fact appears to be an indication that the merely moralist interpretation is not finally true. Morality as a form of the spirit is wrongly taken, as</page><page sequence="8">184 W. R. MATTHEWS. perhaps by Fichte, to be the whole of the life of the spirit. Yet even here we must not abandon the formula which we have ventured to apply to the other modes of the life of spirit. Though morality depends upon contrast, it does not depend on that alone. The ethical consciousnesss cannot regard the not-self as merely alien, purely impervious to ideal ends. Its primary aspect as opposition is itself a response to the moral self, since it is precisely that opposition which the moral will requires in order to be moral will. But further, the moral consciousness, in spite of Kant, could not subsist in the face of a " nature " which was so " step-motherly " as to refuse all response to its ideal aims. If it could be shown that the " other " were essentially and as such the mere opposite, the totally recalcitrant, the life of moral effort would cease to be. There is, indeed, as I hold, a further implication of the moral consciousness, or rather perhaps an affirmation which the ethical personality is impelled to make, namely that its ideals, its judgments of value, are founded in reality, that they " stand fast like the strong mountains." But when we say this we have already passed beyond the borders of the moral consciousness to the religious; and, as we have already admitted, it is not easy to separate these two forms of the life of the spirit, the moral and the religious; here more plainly than elsewhere, though not more necessarily, the one leads on to the other. It is time to attempt the delineation of the religious conscious ness in its determinate nature. As we have seen, it issues, like all the other forms, from a primal intuition of the continuity of the self with an other which is more than a mere opposite, an other which responds. It is expressed as an interpretation of the other, and in this again it does not differ from the other permanent forms of the life of spirit. It differs from them in the mode of its interpretation, or, in what comes to the same thing, the thoroughgoingness of its affirmation of continuity. We</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION AS INTERPRETATION. 185 may say that whereas the other interpretations are " anthropic," affirming the validity of one or other aspect of the person, or, if you like, " projecting" one or other aspect, perception, emotion, will, religion is anthropomorphic and projects or affirms the whole person, it interprets the " other " in terms of the most concrete experience, that of the self before it has been dissected by analysis. If we may distinguish the two salient needs of the human self which seek satisfaction in the religious consciousness, they are the need for unity and the need for the substantiation of value. The need for unity may first be briefly considered. We may recognise an element of truth in what I may call the " intellec- tualist " theory of religion, the view, namely, that it is a crude and childlike speculation, of which the motive is curiosity and the purpose explanation of phenomena. Such theories have been held by Tylor and Sir James Frazer, and, from a different point of view, by Croce, who regards religion as essentially mythology. The motive force of religion is not, however, a merely intellectual curiosity, nor are its first beliefs a clever hypothesis. It springs from an impulse which is indeed within the intellect but also within the life of will, emotion and imagina- tion-the impulse to unify inner and outer experience. At first sight it might seem a strange paradox to describe the thirst for unity as a fundamental spring of religious experience, for the impression made upon us by such forms of belief as animism, polytheism and polydaemonism, is that of incoherence and diversity; we are confronted with a world falling apart. But this is because we view the religions of uncivilized man from our own standpoint. For us a return to polytheism would doubtless be a falling back into chaos and incoherence. But when we try to place ourselves at the standpoint of the primitive believer, we can see that for him his belief in spirits or daemons T</page><page sequence="10">186 W. R. MATTHEWS. is a relative unification. There is truth in the saying of Professor Hocking, " all polytheism is imperfect monotheism." There is no need to dwell upon this aspect of the religious consciousness in its higher developments, for there, I suppose, it is generally admitted. Baron von luigel has abundantly illustrated the desire of the mystic to rise away from multiplicity to unity. It is true that there have been expressions of this desire which have implied a mere negation of multiplicity and flight to a bare transcendent One, but that has not been the most complete development of the religious consciousness. For that more excellent way to know God is not to negate multiplicity but to affirm it in its true being, as an element within the unity, and if Augustine can say " Deum et animam scire cupio. Nihil ne plus? Nihil omnino " (Soliloq, I., 7), it is because, like Malebranche, he sees all things in God. The second need which is met in the religious consciousness may be called that for the substantiation of values. The human mind seeks for an objective basis for its judgments of good and right, to be assured that they are not mere passing preferences, but grounded in reality. Notoriously, the divine beings of uncivilized mankind are the guardians of the tribal custom and later of the accepted law. The monotheistic faiths have held that God is the Sustainer of Values, Himself the supreme Value. It makes no difference that the nature of the values has changed and that the content of the God idea has corre- spondingly varied. If the conception of the nature of the life of the spirit with which we are working is correct, that is pre- cisely what we should expect. The mind begins with an intuition of continuity with an other which is akin, with an other which responds. Man knows God as he knows himself: but the converse is true, he knows himself as he knows God. Connected with this characteristic element of the religious interpretation is a characteristic of the religious attitude-</page><page sequence="11">RELIGION AS INTERPRETATION. 187 that which Schlenimacher touches upon in his " absolute depend- ence," and Otto in his sense of the " numinous." Religious states of mind contrast with the scientific and the merely moral in this respect, that whereas the scientific and moral are essentially attempts at mastery over the not-self by the self, to bring the objective material within the categories of the understanding, or to bend it to the purposes of the will, the religious attitude seeks rather to be mastered, to bend itself to that other with which it is continuous. That is because the other for religion is the realization of its values, it finds there what are its highest values-or it projects, if you prefer the word. In this respect the religious attitude is more closely akin to that of aesthetic enjoyment which seeks not to alter the object but to remain in its presence; but it differs from the aesthetic in this, that though self-abnegating it is not passive, for religion includes co-operation. This difference arises from a difference in .the interpretation of the object. For religion the object is not passive but active, not dead but alive. It is no part of the purpose of this paper to enter into the general question of the validity of this intuition or the particular question of the validity of the religious consciousness, but it is relevant here to remark upon an allegation which is frequently made against the religious interpretation of existence. It is said that we have here a case of " projection ": that man projects his desires, ideals, hopes, himself, upon the outer world, or the unknowable, or upon something " I know not what," for the designations of this other conceived as mere blank or mere opposite are many and divergent. We may reply in a two-fold manner. First, by refusing to accept the merely abstract conception of the self which this view demands, the view which implies that the self " has " anything purely in its own right and as a merely private creation. The self never is thus isolated. It is and it develops only in relation with that</page><page sequence="12">188 W. R. MATTHEWS. other with which it is continuous. If it has ideas or desires or hopes or is a self, it has and is these things only through its constant dynamic relation with the beyond-self. There is nothing therefore, in principle, which can be a mere projection, nothing in the self which has not its ground both within and beyond the self. If, however, this utterly untenable and viciously abstract concept of the self is maintained we must insist that the full sceptical conclusions should be drawn. There is then nothing whatever which is not a mere projection, no concept of science, no idea of the reason which has not a psychical origin, and if to be a projection is to be condemned, we must resign ourselves to the admission that no mental or spiritual activity of ours has any objective validity. We must, however, proceed to indicate another characteristic of the religious consciousness which arises from those which we have already tried to indicate. We may raise the question whether the life of religion is practical or theoretical. Is its aim contemplation or the effecting of some purpose ? Mr. Bradley, in a well-known essay, has sufficiently warned us against the fallacy of taking the categories of theoretical and practical as true antitheses, and we must confess that every form of the life of spirit is both theoretical and practical. The moral activity is not an activity divorced from concepts or one in which truth has no relevance. An ideal end can be contemplated as well as pursued, indeed must be contemplated before it can be pursued. Whether natural science is theoretical or practical is notoriously a subject of controversy, and even philosophy is permeated by practical needs without which there would be no philosophers. The mesthetic activity appears to come most nearly to the position of combining the theoretical and the practical in equal proportions, for in Pesthetic enjoyment our state is almost wholly contemplation, while in artistic creation we are predominantly engaged in changing the outer</page><page sequence="13">RELIGION AS INTERPRETATION. 189 world. Religion appears in its complete form to be the synthesis of the practical and the theoretical aspects of the life of spirit. In the ideal development of religion they lie no longer side by side or occur as alternative modes, but as two aspects of one and the same activity; religion is a practical contemplation and a contemplative practice. And this is exemplified in the religious interpretation of reality which affirms, not one aspect of the self but the self as a vital unity of the real which is also beyond. This leads us to remark upon the opinion of Croce that religion is not a permanent and genuine form of the spirit, but rather a stage on the journey to philosophy, an instable compound of art and thought. This opinion rests partly on the strange view that religion consists wholly of mythology, which we have already noticed and which we must not here criticise. The suggestion, however, may be made that religion in its ideal development is rather the synthesis of the other forms of the spirit, not to be abolished in theoretical contemplation but to unite moral, sasthetic and scientific activity within itself. Thus we could trace the course of religion from the primitive intuition of continuity with an other which is responsive, through the stage where particular forms of activity, all depending on the same intuition, differentiate themselves and claim to occupy the field, up to the ideal end in which the sundered forms are combined again in the religious interpretation of the world. I confess that I am perplexed concerning the place of philosophy. At present, even though the thought appears a blasphemy, I am inclined to relegate it to the place which Croce assigned to religion and regard it as no permanent element in the activity of mind. It bears some marks of being an amalgam, falling as it does into two main divisions-the theory of knowledge and the theory of reality. In the former it is perhaps only the extension of logic- and in the latter is attempting, with croubtful success, a task which is essentially religious. u</page><page sequence="14">190 W. R. MATTHEWS. Professor Whitehead has said that the dogmas of religion are attempts to sum up religious experience just as the dogmas of science are the attempts to sum up perceptual experience. The analogy is perhaps not quite so simple or direct as Whitehead suggests, and I am inclined to hold that interpretation enters into experience both perceptual and religious from the very beginning. But this at least is clear, if the view of the nature of religion which this paper has suggested is true, there can be no finality in religious interpretation any more than in scientific. The mode of interpretation remains constant but its expression has unlimited scope. The crude anthropomor- phism of the lower religion gives place to the higher anthro- pomorphism of the monotheistic faiths, whose God is essentially reason and righteousness, but the final word has not been spoken. The determination of that Other who, as religion believes, responds to the deep needs of man, is not complete. It cannot be complete until man knows what he himself truly is.</page></plain_text>
