What Shere Hite does not call attention to is an intriguing recurrence in many of the responses: the question is heard as a charge and it is imagined to be coming from another male. The basic point now seems to me inescapable, though to say "inescapable" is in no way to say that the history of literary theory and criticism has found it so (or that I have always found it so). One way of understanding that history is to read it as a series of ingenious escapes from the basic point which is economic and sexual (in that order: the order of repression) and which goes something like this: What we know as "femininity" is internally linked to what we know as "masculinity" because both designations are highly motivated cultural constructions of biological difference that do powerful social work at the moment when they are lived, when they constitute the barely conscious and barely reflected upon substance of belief. The political synonym for "belief" is "ideology" in the particular sense of "ideology" as a constructed thing which nevertheless feels natural and is never (or is only rarely) experienced as a thing bearing interested human intention. The basic ideological point has to do with social en- genderment, and it means, among other things, if you're male, that you must police yourself for traces of femininity. If you're male it means, among other things, that the great dread is not so much that another man might call you feminine or womanly (in our culture, a pretty dreadful prospect), but that you might have to call yourself feminine or womanly. The political issue of gender has recently been the special concern of feminist criticism and eventually, after a long look at Wallace Stevens, I'll address feminism directly, in what may be its institutionally most potent form. In 1914, after a hiatus of some fifteen years, a period of poetic self- silencing in the pursuit of economic success, Wallace Stevens went public again with his poetry. In between his years at Harvard (1897-1900), when he published frequently in undergraduate magazines, and his move to Hartford, Connecticut in 1916, when he made his initial appearances in the newly emerging little magazines of literary modernism, Stevens led a double life in New York City. The lion's share of his waking hours was spent trying (and mainly failing) to earn a good wage-and by "good wage" I mean a wage that would enable him to resume the comfortable Frank Lentricchia is professor of English at Duke University.

In the late hours of evening during his New York years he read and occasionally wrote verses; on weekends he took marathon walks in the country of twenty to thirty miles. In this period between Harvard and his appearance in the little magazines fell his courtship of Elsie Moll. It went on for about five years, not because she held him off (the opposite appears to have been the case), but because he was not about to be married until he felt himself economically secure as his father had defined economic security for him. Part of his courting of Elsie involved sharing with her what he called his "secret" passion for poetry. In a letter written to her about a year and a half before the appearance of "Sunday Morning," and with deceptively light and humorous tone, Stevens touched what should have been a central issue of The Hite Report on Male Sexuality. In effect, he called himself feminine or womanly: I sit at home o' nights. But I read very little. I have, in fact, been trying to get together a little collection of verses again; and although they are simple to read, when they're done, it's a deuce of a job (for me) to do them. Keep all this a great secret. There is something absurd about all this writing of verses; but the truth is, it elates and satisfies me to do it. It is an all-round exercise quite superior to ordinary reading. So that, you see, my habits are pos- itively lady-like.2 Stevens' designation of verse writing as "positively lady-like" (and I note that the term "lady-like" feminizes in the direction of the leisured class: he is not talking about working women)-on the face of it this designation makes no sense to readers like ourselves whose feel for poetic history tends to be limited to the canonical powers. For not only the great figures but almost all the figures of English and American poetry that we know and he knew or might have known (he knew most) were male. The most powerful poetic presences of his young manhood were Keats and Tennyson on the English side and the Fireside poets on ours. Moreover, when Stevens wrote to Elsie of his lady-like activity, Whitman had at last won acceptance. The curious thing about Stevens' letter is that without even a gesture of argument the heavy fact of male literary authority is simply set aside. The facts do not count in my case, he is implying, and by so implying in effect asks us to set aside the mainstream argument of American literary feminism in The Madwoman in the Attic- that poetry is the most privileged of male literary territories-because something other than the leisured male privilege of English literary history 2.

Verse writing is for me, Stevens suggests, a thing for ladies. It is absurd that I do it. I am an American male. I have to be practical. But there were other poetic forces in Stevens' young manhood, and their gender complicates his male literary inheritance and begins to make sense of the sexual and literary self-deprecation that he voiced to Elsie. Those poets who have not survived in the canon of American poetry- those ever-mournful, ever-self-renouncing, and, in the culture of Stevens, ever-present women (especially present in newspapers)-define the poetic female as a special kind of American womanly cultural agency, maybe even the agency of culture itself. So disseminated was this figure of the woman poet that Mark Twain could count on his readers to recognize her in his collective send-up in the Emmeline Grangerford episode of Huckleberry Finn. ("She warn't particular, she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about, just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her 'tribute' before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker.") Emmeline Grangerford was a type of the poet that Stevens could not desire and yet could not help (at some level) but assume as a figure of himself, so pervasive was her cultural presence when he was beginning to think of a life as a poet.3 In spite of the effort, then, which marks most of his letters to Elsie, to master issues of gender, vocation, and money with flip tone, Stevens registers and unmasks, against his desire, what proved to be the un- masterable situation that he'd prefer to submerge in "the gaiety of lan- guage," to use his phrase, which is supposed to, but can't, redeem his social malheur. His "absurd" habit of verse writing embodies this unavoidable structural contradiction in bourgeois culture: as it brings forth feelings of pleasure ("it elates and satisfies me to do it") while engaging him in the sort of exertion synonymous with work ("a deuce of ajob"), it triggers at the very moment of pleasure the negative judgment of his macho superego because this job can bring no economic support, cannot earn the characterization "work"-hence is really no job at all. His "absurd" habit of verse writing necessarily forces upon him a feeling at odds with his maleness-the feeling of the sexual other within, in the mask of poetic culture: the lady poet. So when we ask, Just who is this "me" made happy by verse writing?, the embedded cultural logic of his letter to Elsie makes us answer that Stevens' "me" is in some fundamental sense a lady- 3.

Elsie could be entrusted with the secret. Elsie would understand. Fifteen years earlier Garrett Stevens, successful lawyer, small busi- nessman, and a poet himself (the first Wallace Stevens, as it were), had sent his son, then at Harvard, this letter. It would haunt his son's young manhood: Our young folks would of course all prefer to be born like English noblemen with Entailed estates, income guaranteed and in choosing a profession they would simply say-"How shall I amuse myself"-but young America understands that the question is-"Starting with nothing, how shall I sustain myself and perhaps a wife and family-and sqnd my boys to College and live comfortably in my old age." Young fellows must all come to that question for unless they inherit money, marry money, find money, steal money or somebody presents it to them, they must earn it and earning it save it up for the time of need. How best can he earn a sufficiency! What talent does he possess which carefully nurtured will produce something which people want and therefore will pay for. This is the whole problem! and to Know Thyself!4 A few years after the receipt of this letter, while toiling unhappily in the competitive world of New York journalism, Stevens in fact requested guaranteed income from his father so that he might pursue another kind of career in writing, one that could not be economically productive: one which could not sustain himself, much less a wife, family, a college education for his sons, and a comfortable old age. His father refused his request (see L, pp. 52-53). The son of Garrett Stevens had begun to understand but apparently had not yet learned to live with the primary lesson in American history that was to be his burden as it was the burden of all young America's males. His father was passing on the middle-class wisdom of Poor Richard and Horatio Alger that to be born an American is typically to be born without a sustaining economic past: to start with nothing, even if your father (like Garrett Stevens) has sustained himself, a wife, and has sent his boys (not his daughters) to college, because such a father in achieving such accomplishments was likely to have exhausted all that he had earned. What little he might pass on would never be enough for his son to sustain himself, his wife, and so on. The aristocratic model of English poetic history which motivates the argument of The Madwoman in the Attic does not pertain in the United States because to be born an American is to be born into a context where literary patronage virtually does not exist and where your padre cannot be your good 4.

I have done it, Garrett Stevens was saying to his son, now prove your manhood by imitating me to the letter. As a high school senior, and showing considerable promise of being his father's son, Stevens took first place in a speech contest by celebrating, in a rising patriotic rhetoric, the self-made man-the "one grand result of Democracy, which feudalism, which caste, and which monarchy, can never know." "We cannot help but admire the man," he continued, "who with indomitable and irrepressible energy breasting the wave of conditions, grows to become the concentration of power and worth."5 Of course when he gave voice to this founding American ideology and ever-recurrent immigrant's dream of America-What could it mean to be an American and not dream this dream?-Stevens himself was no self-made man who had breasted the wave of conditions: he was in fact on his way to Harvard, he had experienced the pleasures of summer camp, good books, excellent food, and a mother who did not have to spend eight to ten hours a day, five or six days a week in a factory, and who mothered him and his siblings dearly. At least until he was forced to move into the world on his own, he would have no experience of the economic terrors of self- making and would likely have trouble even imagining the consequences should his energy for economic self-making prove to be anything less than indomitable and irrepressible. Garrett Stevens' upper middle-class daughters might have to face economic terror, too, if, say, they failed to marry someone like their daddy-or if, say, refusing the gender typecasting of their society, they struck out on their own, in efforts to become self- made women. Stevens' move to New York in 1900 forced him to bear witness to the thinness of his middle-class insulation. Shortly after getting there he entered into his journal a reflection on a Harvard graduate he had never met but of whom he had heard much, one Philip Henry Savage. This journal entry echoes his prize-winning high school speech, it echoes the Poor Richard letter his father sent to him at Harvard, and it touches a new theme. This would-be ruggedly independent new American man would somehow, if he could, join his aesthetic sense, already heavily cultivated as a teenager and at Harvard, to what he was beginning to see as the unavoidable economic plot of his existence: Savage was an admirable fellow. Mason calls his attempt at self-support "praiseworthy though quixotic!" This is absurd. Savage was like every other able-bodied man-he wanted to stand alone. Self-dependence is the greatest thing in the world for a young man &amp; Savage knew it. I cannot talk about the subject, however, because I know too little about it. But for one thing, Savage went 5. Quoted in Milton J.

[SP, pp. 82-83] Very soon Stevens would know much more about the subject. His New York years (1900-1916) quickly became an effort to achieve Savage's sort of balance of necessity and pleasure, business and play, act and perception, not because Stevens was reading Kantian aesthetics, but because that sort of schizoid balance ("the summum bonum") was the very thing that his bourgeois socialization as the son of Garrett Stevens taught him to desire. The story of his New York years was mainly a story of his failure to achieve the summum bonum, or of his success if weekend Emersonianism must suffice. The means of self-dependence pursued Monday through Friday; things not for themselves alone but for his self, pursued and savored on Saturdays and Sundays: The roads are strewn with purple oak leaves, brown chestnut leaves, and the golden and scarlet leaves of maples. I doubt if there is any keener delight in the world than, after being penned up for a week, to get into the woods on such a day-every pound of flesh vibrates with new strength, every nerve seems to be drinking at some refreshing spring. And after one has got home, how delicious to slip into an easy chair &amp; to feel the blood actually leaping in one's pulses, a wild fire, so to speak, burning in one's cheeks. [SP, p. 111] One way of mitigating this solution of the "weekend"-a therapeutic as well as a temporal concept in bourgeois life-and of joining his vocation with his avocation, or so it seemed to Stevens, lay in his first choice of career in journalism, a field which he tried, with the assistance of his Harvard teacher Barrett Wendell, as soon as he got to New York. The guiding principle behind his choice seems to have been this: Write all the time, write sometimes because you want to, and write when you must, for a living, but write. He quickly learned, however, that the monetary rewards of journalism were erratic, the writing assignments mainly a grind, and his future as a journalist just too chancy. All of which was brought sharply into focus for him in the depressing spectacle of a funeral of a fellow journalist who also wrote fiction that he respected. Stevens found the affair "wretched, rag, tag, and bobtail"; hardly anyone went to the church. Those in attendance were obviously lower class. A few literary types showed up, but in appearance it was impossible to distinguish them from the nonliterary and merely poor. Stephen Crane deserved better: As the hearse rattled up the street over the cobbles, in the stifling heat of the sun, with not a single person paying the least attention to it and with only four or five carriages behind it at a distance I</page><page sequence="8">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 749 realized much that I had doubtingly suspected before-There are few hero-worshippers. Therefore, few heroes. [SP, pp. 78-79] Crane's funeral gave Stevens a glimpse of a possible writerly future. He entered law school. Three years later, in August of 1904, and about a month or so after being admitted to the New York bar, Stevens wrote a retrospective med- itation in his journal on the perilous comforts of middle-class life as he had known it. Theodore Dreiser couldn't have done it better. This journal passage marks the birth of Wallace Stevens as class-conscious and self- conscious economic man for whom the American dream is no longer an abstraction; Wallace Stevens-real-life brother of some of the most com- pelling figures in modern American fiction: Carrie Meeber and G. W. Hurstwood in Sister Carrie, Thomas Sutpen in Absalom, Absalom!, Jay Gatsby. What makes Stevens different and maybe more typical-neither Dreiser nor Faulkner nor Fitzgerald would tell his story-is his sense that he has been expelled from Eden, that his particular form of the American dream involves the recapturing of a lost social and economic status that he had never earned but which he had nevertheless enjoyed, the resumption of a life that had fashioned the mode of his desire and had given him a taste of the good life. Suddenly he felt a shocking solidarity with the poor who had hitherto only repulsed him in their filth and poverty, as the sight of Italian immigrants had once made it impossible for him to finish a snack of clams on the half shell; he was coming to know a new sort of closeness with those who had hitherto made him feel faintly disgusted when they sat too near him on commuter trains. At the age of twenty-five Stevens came to know economic difference and the peculiar privilege of middle-class life in America. The Italian immigrants he saw in Greenwich Village, like the bums in the Bowery he observed on his walks in the city, might dream the dream of upward mobility- they could sink no lower economically. The fabulously wealthy of his time-legends even then, like the Carnegies, the Mellons, the Rockefellers: the class Fitzgerald called, simply, "the very rich"-could pass out dimes in the streets if they liked (and they did). Their children, whatever spiritual descents they might experience, could look with impunity upon the poor: they would never be one of them. But Stevens, and those like him, knew better than to dream the dream of upward mobility: passage into the realm of the Rockefellers was not realistic; a repetition of one's father's economic status was more likely and it was clearly desirable over the other possibility which is the special privilege of the middle class: the possibility of economic descent. The dream of the middle class in America is the nightmare of downward mobility: Stevens' version of the nightmare concludes with an effort to resist it, with what in his writing is an almost never expressed impulse, the utopian urge toward classless society.</page><page sequence="9">750 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens The mere prospect of having to support myself on a very slender purse has brought before my mind rather vivid views of the actual facts of existence in the world. There are astonishingly few people who live in anything like comfort; and there are thousands who live on the verge of starvation. The old Biblical injunctions to make the earth fertile and to earn one's bread in the sweat of one's brow are one's first instructions. True, it [is] not necessary to start from the soil; but starting with nothing whatever-to make a fortune-is not wholly inspiring after a fellow has spent more or less time lolling about. It is decidedly wrong to start there with one's tastes fully developed &amp; to have to forego all satisfaction of them for a vague number of years. This is quite different from beginning as other men do. It is more like being up already &amp; working down to a certain point. Another phase of the thing is that when one has lived for twenty-five years with every reasonable wish granted &amp; among the highest associations-starting at the bottom suddenly reveals millions of fellow men struggling at the same point, of whom one previously had only an extremely vague conception. There was a time when I walked downtown in the morning almost oblivious of the thousands and thousands of people I passed; now I look at them with extraordinary interest as com- panions in the same fight that I am about to join. [SP, p. 114]6 So for this middle-class professional, endowed with capitalist values by his culture through his father, in part against his literary desires, the inescapable question pressed upon him first by family and then by his New York experience is this: How can I turn some part of myself (my "talent") into a commodity that people will want and "therefore pay for"? The choice of profession need not "amuse," it need not give pleasure (much later in his poetic career he would insist that the supreme fiction must give pleasure), but (as Father said) it must pay. To "Know Thyself," according to Garrett Stevens, is to know yourself as economic man, fit for the hurly-burly of the marketplace where the big boys slug it out. To "Know Thyself" for Garrett Stevens' son meant that in finding his productive talent he would prove his masculinity in general and prove it in particular as equal to his father's. But knowing himself also meant knowing that he was given pleasure by his verse-writing talent-and to know himself that way as a young man meant to feel himself as the potential subverter of his official role as a young American male. Only leisured women and leisured men (like men and women in the great tradition of English letters, or fortunate ladies and gentlemen in the American tradition) could do what he wanted to do. Modernist poetics 6. I would have been technically indebted to a few points in Joan Richardson's fine biographical essay on Stevens had her essay not appeared after my own work was drafted. See Richardson, "Wallace Stevens: Toward a Biography," Raritan 4 (Winter 1985): 42- 66; all further references to this work, abbreviated "WS," will be included in the text.</page><page sequence="10">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 751 in the United States, especially Stevens' version of it, is sexually and economically framed (in both senses) from the beginning. Modernist poetics in the United States begins with the great problem of the com- fortable bourgeois world: the antagonism of duty and happiness. Modernist poetics in Stevens is a feminization of the literary life motivated by capitalist values, and, at the same time, a struggle to overcome this feminization which is more or less equivalent (in our culture) to the trivialization of literature and the literary impulse. Garrett Stevens was by most standards an unsuccessful poet, and in the end his failure in business was so disastrous-he went bankrupt- that his son had no choice but to stand "on his own two feet." His son's life and career were therefore at once imitation and stunning transcendence of the father. A brilliant success in two areas, Stevens' bifurcated career perfectly realized the hegemonic aims of his capitalist socialization. As- siduously "masculine" in his pursuit of economic fulfillment-Stevens worked well beyond retirement age because he had no intention of ever retiring-in his aesthetic life he cultivated the self-abnegating virtues that his society relegated to the "feminine" sphere: in other words, he cultivated "culture" itself in the sense that capitalism had shaped for that term. So the virtues of culture that Stevens was heir to (feeling, sensibility, self-renunciation) functioned as a critique of capitalist willfulness and greed, but critique at a safe distance; critique that could not function as intervention and trigger of social change. The realm of culture, so well contained outside the realm of economic action, becomes a rationalization of the order of things. The life of Stevens was an expression at once of the ease with which that contradiction could be sustained and of the inescapable discontent of an existence in which schizophrenia is normalized as the structure of everyday life. Complacencies of the peignoir, and late Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, And the green freedom of a cockatoo Upon a rug...7 Those who read Wallace Stevens know that the woman evoked in these opening lines of "Sunday Morning" and then debated with so strenuously and unfairly is not to be taken as the representation of a real woman. We have been taught that she represents the traditional religious impulse-the need, as Stevens phrased it in the poem, "for some imperishable bliss"; a conservative figure who sums up all at once 7. Stevens, "Sunday Morning," Collected Poems (New York, 1982), p. 66; all further quotations of Stevens' poems are to this edition.</page><page sequence="11">752 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens the resistance to Darwin, the resistance to the aesthetes, and the resistance to the higher criticism: a traditional muse, maybe, but one who must be symbolically put in her place, because she stands against the very literary and intellectual styles that a young modernist in the early twentieth century is supposed to be comfortable with. But she may also be Stevens' muse, the first appearance of his interior paramour, part of Stevens himself-a suggestion made in passing by Harold Bloom.8 And much of what Stevens' critics up to and including Bloom have said about her is persuasive. The preponderance of scholarship is ample testimony that "Sunday Morning," in its atmospherics and in its ideas, is a conventional poem, very much of its intellectual period: a late nineteenth-century set piece on behalf of the religion of art, written in New York City in 1914 and published in 1915 in Harriet Monroe's Poetry. Before I make her a figure of something else, however, like a figure of the muse or of religion or of a deep-seated (if repressed) impulse in the poet, I prefer to dwell on the obvious unspoken of Stevens criticism. The "she" of the opening lines of "Sunday Morning" is a comfortable woman of class, whose expensive and leisured femaleness Stevens insists upon. By their peignoirs ye shall know them, as well as by their associated commodities, the good things that money can buy. Her cockatoo, her rug, her coffee, her oranges: these, to put a wicked twist on some later lines of the poem, these are the measures of her soul. The coffee, the oranges, the cockatoo, these are not, appearances to the contrary not- withstanding, natural things in themselves, those pure "comforts of the sun"-self-sufficient sensuous indulgences that Stevens urges her to par- take of as substitute for religious impulse. For the coffee, the oranges, and the cockatoo are bought things filtered through the economic process: nature mediated by human labor-in the specific instances of Stevens' opening lines, by laborers who do not, but only because they cannot, sit about on Sunday morning in their smoking jackets and peignoirs, sipping coffee and nibbling on a dietetic breakfast. These sorts of laborers don't tend to go on diets, nor would they be taking late breakfasts. They'd be where the lady thinks she ought to be-at church. The coffee, the oranges, and the cockatoo are things like rugs-all metonymies for value in its commodity form-because they are all things for sale. "All New York, as I have seen it, is for sale-and I think the parts I have seen are the parts that make New York what it is" (SP, p. 72). Stevens wrote that in a depressed mood shortly after moving from Cam- bridge. Everyday life in New York dramatized for him the spectacle of consumer capitalism as a frustrating spectacle of surreal narcissism: "Everybody is looking at everybody else-a foolish crowd walking on mirrors." In this social setting, desire assumes mimetic form, and all 8. Harold Bloom, Wallace Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate (Ithaca, N.Y., 1977), p. 27.</page><page sequence="12">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 753 commodities-privileged lives are a form thereof-become the mirrors of romance, promises of fulfillment quite beyond the explicit use of commodities: entries into an existence definitively more pleasurable than one's own, and available for a price. The world of New York, a "field of tireless and antagonistic interests," is the ultimate marketplace: Stevens called it "fascinating but horribly unreal"-he meant "unfortunately real," I think, because so destructively tempting. Only nature is exempted by him from his mimetic economy of desire, but only because (he notes this sardonically) winds and clouds are not "generated in Yorkville" or "man- ufactured in Harlem" (SP, p. 73). "Sunday Morning" 's site of production is New York and the poem comes, in fact, at the end of almost fourteen years of mostly unhappy New York life. We cannot really locate the elegant interior and the woman of "Sunday Morning" there, but we can place Stevens in New York, in shabby elegance, within a room of his own. The interior decoration in Stevens' little apartment bore pictures of desire of what he thought "most real" and (in the heart of the city) most not there. The carpet on the floor of my room is gray set off with pink roses. In the bath room is a rug with the figure of a peacock woven in it-blue and scarlet, and black, and green, and gold. And on the paper on my wall are designs of fleur-de-lis and forget-me- not. Flowers and birds enough of rags and paper-but no more. In this Eden, made spicey with the smoke of my pipe which hangs heavy in the ceiling, in this Paradise ringing with the bells of streetcars and the bustle of fellow boarders heard through the thin partitions, in this Elysium of Elysiums I now shall lay me down. [SP, p. 73] The verbal control and lightness of touch on display in this as in so many of his journal entries and letters prefigure the relaxed authority of his poems. Leisurely ease and satisfaction, witty power over circumstances and self-control-"happiness" is probably the word I want-these are things he needed most to feel and sought to create for himself in everyday life. The writing of Wallace Stevens, injournals, letters, essays, and poems, enacts that quest for happiness with a verbal prowess so striking that the existential absence of happiness-the thing that most moves the writing-tends to get hidden. The contentment he communicates to us in the journal entry about his protected little apartment is really a veiling of the feelings of being out of place in a world wholly involved with getting and spending and which he can't help but encounter daily on the streets of New York. The young Stevens smoking his pipe in his room meditates what is presumably not "generated in Yorkville" through the mediation of rugs and wallpaper, what might be generated in Yorkville. The world of aesthetic enjoyment, though often identified in his journals with experiences of nature-not nature in a vacuum but nature as a</page><page sequence="13">754 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens motivated negation of New York: what he walked away from on week- ends-this aesthetic world of the weekend is not enough in itself to alleviate the dissatisfaction Stevens felt through the work week. His radical desire was for the aesthetic Monday through Friday, and he got it (in bourgeois fashion) at night in his apartment, an interiorized, private place, in the middle of New York, where decor and furnishings delusively appear to be freed from the "field of tireless and antagonistic interests" and are not therefore meditated with Marxist X-ray vision as products of economic leverage and exploited labor, but rather felt as things in themselves. Commodities so cherished are not heaven but the image of heaven-Stevens calls it Eden-where the delights of commodities are even more keenly felt (like stolen kisses) thanks to the thinness of partitions that do not block out New York. It is worth emphasizing what ought to be clear: Stevens' room is not explicable in Leo Marx's terms as a garden whose satisfactions are stoked by the invasion of the machine. It is a place whose objects of pleasure are machine-made. The phrase for all of this, "commodity fetishism," belongs to Karl Marx, but some of its subtlest implications belong to modern American writers. Commodity fetishism-the hedonism of bourgeois man bought at the psychic expense of a repression of the economic process which gives rise to commod- ities-is the point of departure for Stevens for an experience that would not be commodity-bound, the basis of an experience that would be radically liberated not only from commodities, but also (in his room in the city) from natural objects as well (Stevens' walks in the country were sometimes spoiled by evidence of human presence) and, finally, that would be liberated even from the determinacies of gender, class, and human agency. For Stevens the road to transcendence was often paved with com- modities-by his habit in later life of collecting objets d'art from abroad and bringing the most satisfactory of them into his private bedroom. It was a road paved by the consciousness that felt its freedom in owning and in so owning could withdraw the thing owned, hide it away from the economic field of interests where things were often lost. The successful insurance executive who bought fine things for his room from Ceylon, in the 1930s and 1940s, makes his first extant appearance in his Harvard journal when he writes, "It is a great pleasure to seize an impression and lock it up in words: you feel as if you had it safe forever" (SP, p. 48). He made another appearance a few years later in this letter to Elsie when he told her: "You know that I do with you as I like in my thoughts: I no sooner wish for your hand than I have it-no sooner wish for anything to be said or done than it is said or done; and none of the denials you make me are made there. You are my Elsie there" (L, p. 96). Buy it, with your money or your mind, but buy it and make it safe. Ezra Pound's modernist shibboleth, "Make it new," becomes in Wallace Stevens, "Make it private."</page><page sequence="14">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 755 Stevens' early letters and journals take us into the social kitchen of his poetics-they show us the process, not quite perfectly submerged by the poems, within which and from which he wrested-almost literally pulled free-his moments of aesthesis as interiorized moments of impression isolated from social time and severed from all human contacts, and preserved as images, autonomous thing-like perceptions driven by a will to purity. The aesthetic for Stevens is a process of making interior, from the real space of the streets of New York to the private space of his room and then into the psychic space of consciousness (perilously sealed now to the outside) where pastoral experience can be made safe and where in his room, literal and psychic, the pastoral can be had any time, any place. Aesthesis as the formation of impression is the repression of New York-a process of levitation which first transforms the bums in Washington Square into "crows in rainy weather" before taking the final subjective leap into the atmosphere (I mean the "air") of an impres- sionist painting and the experience of color abstracted from all objects: The other morning as I came home I walked up to Washington Square to take a look at the trees. The birds were just beginning to cheep &amp; there was a little warm wind stirring among the leaves. I was surprised to find the large number of people who were sleeping on the grass and on the benches. One or two of them with collars turned up &amp; hands in their pockets shuffled off through the sulphurous air like crows in rainy weather. The rest lay about in various states of collapse. There must have been a good many aching bones when the sun rose. The light was thin and bluishly misty; by the time I was in my room it had become more intense &amp; was like a veil of thin gold. [SP, p. 80] In light of the vocational anxieties he expressed in New York, and placed side by side, the passage from Stevens' journals on the rug with the peacock woven into it and the opening lines of "Sunday Morning" (a poem written in New York) unveil a decisive scene for modern American poetry: the author as economic as well as sexual transvestite. It is a densely entangled scene because it compresses and fairly smothers in sensuous detail issues of gender, the commodity, and religion: the lady in her peignoir, the cockatoo upon her rug, and the dream of Palestine, site of Christian catastrophe. One of the traditional questions of scholarship on the poem-is the cockatoo real or is it a pattern in the rug?-becomes irrelevant in the poem's and in the poet's social mise-en-scdne. Traditional Stevens criticism raises the question because it wants to know how to take "green freedom." Is Stevens being ironic about nature, or literal? Is nature really his realm of freedom? But real or imagined-cockatoo "upon," not "in" a rug, suggests a real cockatoo-the phrase "green</page><page sequence="15">756 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens freedom" embodies an ironic intention directed not toward the bird as representation of nature, but toward the woman's relationship to the bird, a relation that point for point repeats Stevens' relation to his peacock in a rug and his forget-me-nots in wallpaper. A pet cockatoo (whether female or male, the sound of freedom is phallic, cocky: it will become transformed, later in the poem, into the sound of men chanting naked in a ring), a pet cockatoo upon a rug is a bought bird in captivity. Not so much an ironic bird as a pathetic one. The pet cockatoo, like those roses in the rug, is a sign of a relation to nature that expresses androgynous desire (peignoired and pipe-smoking Wallace Stevens) for the green free- dom of an impossible natural autonomy. In Stevens' middle-class settings of freedom, "green freedom" represents maximum desire. It is that setting of freedom as pathos-for-freedom that points to "Sunday Morning" 's logic of displacement which moves the lady (and the poem) from the "complacent" limits of hedonic pleasures (commodity-bound) to the Christian extinguishment of all things and all pleasures in a procession of the dead that ends the first section of the poem-the ascetic renunciation of the worldly, the final freedom promised in silent Palestine: "Dominion of the blood and sepulcher." Renunciation of the worldly is the feminine way in Stevens' culture and it is also the way of the poet who (like himself) defines his writing against the economic: romantic anticapitalism in the high modernist moment is difficult to distinguish from feminine anticapitalism. So Chris- tian fulfillment in "imperishable bliss" is the coded and displaced form of one kind of poetic impulse-for Stevens, a lady-like feminization of writing that must renounce not only the commodity but ultimately also the world of the senses because his sensory experience is fatally mediated by commodities. Feminine renunciation is a radical impulse that he feels (the impulse, as he wrote in his journal, to be "all dream" [SP, p. 71]) but that his male obligations tell him he cannot choose. His images for his relation to poetry and to the woman of his life (lock up the impression, lock up Elsie) tell us that at some level he wishes not to choose the way of renunciation but the way of power, not the ascetic extinguishment of the worldly in Christian glory but the feeling of power over the worldly: lock up and make safe everything you value-your impression, your woman, and the fine things you import from Ceylon. The only image of himself as woman that he can tolerate, therefore, is an image of female power. He can be like a woman and bear it if he can be like the presiding woman evoked in "The Idea of Order at Key West," the single artificer of the world in which she walked, the god of modernist desire as auton- omous God the Mother. The issue is power, and the freedom that power purchases for Stevens, in all senses of the word "purchase." In "Esth6tique du Mal," a poem published almost thirty years after "Sunday Morning," Stevens wrote that "The greatest poverty is not to live / In a physical world." Through the lens of that thesis Stevens in his</page><page sequence="16">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 757 room and the lady of "Sunday Morning" in hers slide together into a single image. They live "inside," surrounded by things that have been refined, picked, caught, shipped, fashioned: representations of nature drained of their naturalness. In "Sunday Morning" Stevens imagines two forms of liberation from that kind of production, both forms perfectly suited to the needs of a secular middle-class poet. His first imagination of liberty is offered in the second section of the poem under a definition of "divinity"; the second is offered in the seventh section as a vision of community. The first form of liberation is offered as resolution for the peignoired woman; the second is offered presumably as resolution for the peignoired woman's desire for paradise, but the community imagined is homogeneously male and in some sense homosexual. Both forms of liberation are utopian: they are offered as the possible, in future tense; both imagine perfection in sensuous, erotic, and natural settings, which make some sense as an American aesthete's religion of nature, but even better sense if read as visions of return to the physical world from an impoverished, oddly unreal, sometimes neurasthenic, and oddly uncom- fortable Prufrockian middle-class existence: Stevens' nature walks on weekends brought him back to physical life-vibrating flesh, refreshed nerves, pulsating blood that made his cheeks burn with color. In sections 2 and 7 of "Sunday Morning" Stevens imagines the transcendence of the social and sexual differences that troubled and defined his young man- hood. The first of the passages is the more radical of the two. Not only gender difference, but agency itself, the apparently autonomous subject, as both site of gender and the perception of gender, is obliterated: Divinity must live within herself: Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued Elations when the forest blooms; gusty Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; All pleasures and all pains, remembering The bough of summer and the winter branch. These are the measures destined for her soul. These lines owe something in particular to the coordinated naturalism and anti-institutionalism of Emerson's address to the Harvard divinity school, and much in general to Emerson's other paeans to self-reliance. As in Emerson it is not the self conceived as autonomous agency or individuality that is the god, not at all that sort of self that is being relied upon, so in "Sunday Morning" "herself" is not identified with divinity. We cannot lose our way if we stick by the quiet precisions of Stevens' language: divinity lives "within" herself, it is housed there, as it may be in any agent, female or male, as Emerson argued. Divinity is affective</page><page sequence="17">758 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens consciousness but not consciousness coincidental with "subjects" or in- dividuals who feel and remember that they feel. No grammatical sloppiness but a philosophical sharpness shapes the lines "All pleasures and all pains, remembering / The bough of summer and the winter branch." The dangling modification (who is remembering?) is a deliberate suppression of the actor who remembers, because it is not an actor who is the true subject of remembering, grieving, elation, pleasure, or pain. Divinity is the subject of the lines, but divinity is not a subject. Divinity is "selfhood" that cannot be translated into gender or, by the ideology of liberalism, into autonomous agency. Stevens' language is erotically provocative (a gusty, wet, blooming passion), but neither genital differentiation nor any other sort of differentiation is anywhere, in this passage, indicated by his language. If no subject, divinity may be something like an intransitive verb because it takes no object. The passions, grievings, and moods have no intention: they are directed to nothing in particular. Divinity so redefined by the very structure of Stevens' syntax is a transcendental in opposition to the transcendence of Christian tradition (the dead in heaven). This is a divinity whose heaven is the earth, where feeling is the expression of natural process, where nature is the motor principle of expression: not passions for, or about rain, but "Passions of rain." If no actor, then no subject; if no worker, then no product; if no gender difference, then no male or female roles; if no labor, then no economy: this is the condition which Stevens envisions as "her" destiny. The image of destiny that Stevens delivers is critical; it is ajudgment upon the social site of "Sunday Morning" 's production: the antagonistic world of men and women where everything is for sale. Syntactically and existentially the mood of these lines is imperative: "Divinity must live within herself." This vision sounds final because it imagines an end to the oppression and divisiveness of gender within capitalist economics. In so imagining that end it promises a destiny which one has trouble taking seriously, perhaps because the one who must take it seriously is one like our- selves-one for whom the oppression and divisiveness to which "Sunday Morning" is in part addressed remain firmly in place. This vision of the promised end feels like the end of the poem, but it is not the end. Perhaps it seemed even to Stevens that as utopian visions go this one's referent was too subjective, its sexuality too disembodied, too idealistic even for this strong son of Emerson. Stevens' utopian vision in the second section of "Sunday Morning" does not address a new world of labor and human relations, sexual and otherwise, where, as he put it in the third section, "The sky will be much friendlier then than now / A part of labor and a part of pain." In his second apocalypse, in the seventh section, Stevens returns us to the world of labor, gender, and genital sexuality-now phallically renewed:</page><page sequence="18">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 759 Supple and turbulent, a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun, Not as a god, but as a god might be, Naked among them, like a savage source. As a vision of the future this passage is so astounding, or so absurd, and for so many (like me), so seductive, that it has stunned into silence some seventy years of commentary on Stevens. I mean silence on the plain sense of the passage and on the enhancement of that plain sense by the social and sexual context of Stevens' young manhood. But Stevens' absurdity is important absurdity because it is not personal and because it joins mainline American literary visions of male utopias: certain raft passages in Huckleberry Finn, the "Squeeze of the Hand" chapter in Moby-Dick, Rip Van Winkle's fantasy in the Catskills of men at play, many, many things in Whitman and, more recently, the Brooks Range conclusion of Norman Mailer's Why Are We in Vietnam? What Stevens imagines for the social future is a place without women; men who work, but whose work cannot be distinguished from the homoerotic pleasure of sexual indulgence (Stevens, a keen etymologist, would have known the kinship of "orgy" with an ancient Greek word related to "work"); men who work nakedly-and in their nakedness bear no signs, as the peignoired woman bears signs, of social difference. Their nakedness and their arrangement in a ring speak the language of fraternity (brothers, but no sisters) and equality. And they chant: in community they create a fundamental poetry-a devotion to a "lordly" nature that is spun out in the sentimentality of choiring angels, a metaphor taken away from traditional Christianity and transvalued with outrageous deliberation into the music of pagan naturalism. The contradictions of Stevens' early life and poetry-work, poetry, and nature itself, the conventional realm of female authority- all are reclaimed for a masculine totality, fused in an image of masculine power: Father Nature. The embeddedness of "Sunday Morning" in the political and eco- nomic materiality of Stevens' America, through the specific historical circumstances of his biography, has long been obscured by the literary history of the poem: the embeddedness of "Sunday Morning" through its network of allusions in a sort of literary materiality. The presence in the poem of Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, and Tennyson ("The Palace of Art"), among other worthies, has been explored with useful results, but the activity of so historicizing Stevens within English and American poetry has been carried off in the quasi-theological atmosphere of idealism, high humanism, formalism, and (more recently) the new idealism of the intertextual method (both Derridean and Bloomian) of anxiety-ridden</page><page sequence="19">760 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens historicisms: as if literary history were an autonomous process; as if poets engaged their dead poetic ancestors, and only their dead canonical ancestors, in direct dialogue; as if what Bloom calls "the poet" in a human being could be usefully segregated because the poet within is somehow free from the economic and sexual being who might marry, have children, and need to earn a living; as if the historical company of poets were actually disencumbered from the entanglements of their nonpoetic his- tories; as if the sophomore survey of English literature were an adequate representation of the process of literary history. Stevens' most distinguished critics, Bloom and Helen Vendler, have led the way by proceeding as if they had never read the poet's letters and journals, or, as if, having read them, they came to the conclusion that the worldly life they found portrayed therein pertained to somebody else. And the theory and practice of the best-known and most influential of American literary feminists (Gilbert and Gubar, Elaine Showalter) give us no respite. "Sunday Morning" is not only encumbered from the "outside," as it were. Its very language does battle with various discourses of idealization from late nineteenth-century American gentility to the critical culture of Bloom and Vendler. Stevens mounts a counter-rhetoric against the words of idealism (holy, divinity, lord, serafin, Jesus, freedom, soul) by bringing those words into the poem and bringing them to earth: freedom is green, soul is passion, the lord is the sun, angels are well-built men. Stevens' struggle with religious ideality, given voice by his leisured lady's need for Christian fulfillment, is simultaneously a struggle against what for us must be a mostly buried literary ideality-the meaning of Keats as Keats had been reconstructed by the powerful literary tastemakers of Stevens' youth. Renunciation, as the need for fulfillment beyond society, economics, and nature, is "Christian," it is "poetic," it is "feminine," and the name of renunciation (especially in Stevens' early poetry) is "Keats." The allusive representation of Keats in "Sunday Morning" is the literary site of convergence of Stevens' economic and sexual anxiety, his lady- like poetic self-consciousness, and his desire to make himself a poet of broad cultural relevance against the authoritative voices of his literary scene. The literary historicity of "Sunday Morning" is no autonomous alternative to its economic materiality; rather it turns out to be both its intensive clarification and its critique. R. H. Stoddard, Richard Watson Gilder, E. C. Stedman, Henry Van Dyke, G. E. Woodberry, and their friends-no longer the names of American literary powers-dominated our poetry and criticism from the death of Whitman and the passing of the Fireside group to the emergence of the little magazines of modernism and the early poems of Frost, Stevens, Eliot, and Pound. The "genteel" circle, as they would later be caustically dubbed, were antididactic literary theorists who preferred Poe among nineteenth-century American poets and championed him against the public-minded eloquence and rhetoric of Longfellow and</page><page sequence="20">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 761 Bryant; they were anticapitalist social critics who stood against indus- trialism, utilitarian ethics, bourgeois man, the entrepreneurial spirit, and their representation in journalism and in realist fiction, that dark duo of the literary spirit for which their genteel scorn was unsurpassed except by their opposite numbers in England: Yeats, Ernest Dowson, and Lionel Johnson.9 And as editors of powerful magazines like the Atlantic and the Century, as anthologists, critics, literary historians, poets, and translators, they enforced their taste. To their strong American echo of English aestheticism, the genteel group added a native dose of renunciation which purified their aestheticist inclination of any Paterian sensuousness for its own sake or any sake. In the atmosphere of late nineteenth-century Anglo-American Hegelianism, these Americans were ascetic aesthetes who cultivated a search for the ideal that entailed a rejection, manichean in force, of the world and the body in the world. Poetry for them was the name of a literary purity that, unlike the prose of fiction or of the essay, would neither minister to the new self-made man nor bring re- muneration from the world of capital. The poet who best represented this purity and at the same time its potential subversion by the temptations of capital and the flesh was Keats. So the rhetorical target of Stevens' modernism is not some presumably old-fashioned sense of the poetic, as in Yeats' exemplary modernist formula in which imagination always opposes rhetoric and action, but the effete modernity of his genteel contemporaries who anticipated most of the canonical modernist literary and social biases. "Sunday Morning" in its literary historicity bears little if any anxiety over the power of a predecessor lyricist. It is instead full of contempt (not too strong a word) for his culture's representation of Keats as a poetic ideal that would divide Stevens against himself. Stevens' fight is to win poetic space from contemporary poets and critics. If "Keats" was a word signifying freedom from bourgeois economic contamination, then, at the same time, and by the force of a deadly cultural logic, "Keats" was also a word signifying sexual otherness to the econo-machismo of Stevens' culture-not freedom to be masculine in some other, perhaps healthier form, but the loss altogether of a culturally readable and culturally ac- ceptable masculinity. This "Keats"-not the poet Stevens read and admired, but the poet re-created by genteel attitudes-would deny Stevens his writerly masculinity in a representation of the poetic vocation that in making it autonomous within capitalist society thereby makes it at best feminine and at worst a desexualized vocation. In his Harvard journal, Stevens makes the point with this incisive remark whose immediate target might appear to be popular women poets like Frances Osgood and Lydia Sigourney, but whose true object is Stedman and his friends, the male 9.

"Poetry and Manhood: Those who say poetry is now the peculiar province of women say so because ideas about poetry are effeminate. Homer, Dante, Shake- speare, Milton, Keats, Browning, much of Tennyson-they are your man-poets. Silly verse is always the work of silly men" (SP, p. 40). The power of those silly men to affect the cultural unconscious of their time might be measured precisely there, with Stevens saying, in so many words, that he knew better, and yet while knowing better nevertheless played out his literary youth as if he feared that he just might be one of those silly men who would be denied poetic manhood. Not one of your man-poets, genteel "Keats" was often crystallized in images of flight. If T. E. Hulme's later attack on the romantics is overstated (he said they were always flying up into the circumambient gas), it is right on target for the romanticism of Stedman and company who turned Keats into a "superb blue moth" and the great odes into the music of "ethereal passion."'1 In fact, the idealization of passion is some- thing like a key to understanding the genteel ethos; Woodberry's title for a volume of poems, Ideal Passions, can stand as the secret subtitle of all their works. Not surprisingly, the publication of the Fanny Brawne letters made passion, apparently not of the ethereal sort, the riveting issue of genteel commentary (public and private) on Keats. Keats' sexual innocence had to be protected at all cost-it was the symbolic mark of what poetry had to be: the safe haven of ideality in a world that the genteel cultural critics found epitomized by the marketplace. Gilder, alone in his room reading the Fanny Brawne correspondence, tells us that he smashed the volume to the floor and cried;" Stedman, in an exemplary essay, concocted (pour l'occasion) formalist theory in order to save Keats the poet from Keats the man (shades of Bloom): the man might have been passion's slave, Stedman had to admit it, but "If you would know an artist's true self, you must discover it through his art."12 In another essay, which suppresses its author's anxieties not at all, Van Dyke-sounding a little like Stevens, in masculine discomfort-first defends Keats against the suspicion that he was a "feminine poet" ("the quality of extreme sensitiveness to outward beauty is not an exclusive mark of femininity"), then admits that Keats was "not a virile poet, like Dante or Shakespeare or Milton"-and may never have become one. On the other hand, Van Dyke is eager to point out (as we watch him sift through the sexual options) that Keats was no senile poet who celebrates "the impotent and morbid passions of decay"-his goddess is no "decrepit Venus sinking into the gutter." Van Dyke's solution to the question of 10. Edmund Clarence Stedman, "Keats," "Genius" and Other Essays (New York, 1911), pp. 82, 85.

Stedman, "Keats," p. 87.</page><page sequence="22">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 763 Keats' sexuality is ingenious: Keats is a "juvenile poet," a writer of "springtime." With no sense of what a bawdy reader might do with his remarks, Van Dyke declares the poetry of Keats "small in bulk and slight in body." Van Dyke's Keats died a sexually suspended twelve-year-old, "sensuous in every line, yet free from the slightest taint of sensuality."'1 Like the father of the poet, Stedman was an early version of Wallace Stevens: he authored treatises on poetic angelism while working as a Wall Street broker. Stedman, author of The Nature and Elements of Poetry, and editor of a history of the New York Stock Exchange, is the forgotten predecessor of the poet who wrote The Necessary Angel while drawing a vice-president's salary at the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company. Stevens' career from its beginning is a troubled expression of an effort to overcome the trivializations that were thrust upon bourgeois writers like himself who could not help but define themselves in self-trivializing terms. But Stevens did not go gently into the good night of modernism, and in "Sunday Morning" his protest is lodged most powerfully in his effort to recover poetic self-respect, whose name was necessarily phallic, from poetic self-trivialization whose various names were "Keats," "fem- ininity," "Christianity," and "ideality." The Keats who appears allusively in "Sunday Morning" is at once mythic weapon to be deployed against Stevens' contemporaries and the representation of what Stevens most feared he'd be forced to become- the genteel poet of a debilitating modernism which reserves literature for the weekend when productive males presumably might have time to consume it and even produce it ("arts and leisure"). "Keats" is present to "Sunday Morning" in sections 4, 5, 6, and 8, where he is evoked for "visionary south" ("Ode to a Nightingale"), for Porphyro's heavy breathing and heavily fruited offering to Madeline ("The Eve of St. Agnes"), for the timelessness of arrested natural processes and acts ("Ode on a Grecian Urn"), and for the somber twilight fluttering of swallows that closes the moody meditation of "To Autumn." In each except the last instance, the unmanned Keats of Stevens' culture is made to speak through the unhappy consciousness of Stevens' dreaded alter ego with whose desires Keats is allusively identified-the yearning lady whose need for the imperishable is projected in the whining tones of genteel idealism. Stevens' comebacks to Keatsian yearning are delivered in a debunking, even hectoring voice, no less cruel because only implied: It makes you sad that "men sit and hear each other groan"? You say that "palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs"? You're telling me, my good woman, that "youth grows pale and specter-thin, and dies"? That "Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes / Or new Love pine at them beyond tomorrow"? Face it: love (this in reductive delight) whispers only "a little out of tenderness." But the hammer blow, twice dealt, comes in the form of an existential proverb: 13. Henry Van Dyke, "The Influence of Keats," Century Magazine (Oct. 1895): 912.</page><page sequence="23">764 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens a proverbial alternative and rewriting of the most famous of Keatsian adages, "Beauty is truth, truth beauty." Stevens says: "Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her, / Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams / And our desires." From such mockery Stevens moves in section 6 to his reading of the urn poem as a desperate exercise in sublimation. To replay Keats' lines in more sexually suggestive language, as Stevens does, is to establish the distinction between himself and his genteel readers of Keats as the liberating distinction between maturity and adolescence. Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, With rivers like our own that seek for seas They never find, the same receding shores That never touch with inarticulate pang? Those suspiciously anthropomorphic rivers flow toward the sea but they never get to pour their waters in because the ever-receptive shores ever recede, ever back away from all penetration. The voice of sexual culmination will never utter the pleasure of its "inarticulate pang," because it will be forever poised at pleasure's very brink. This is "happy happy love"? Stevens' fullest response to genteel Keats comes in the seventh section, in the vision of supple and turbulent men who chant in orgy. The transitions between sections of "Sunday Morning" are abrupt at best, not narrative or logical. In the blank space between sections 6 and 7 Stevens seems to say to the lady of Keatsian yearning (and with maximum intention to shock her): now consider this as a vision of paradise. In its literary context, this seventh section begs to be read as an effort to drown the skinny boy soprano of genteel Keats with the generous Italianate amplitudes of Walt Whitman, whose sexual frankness kept him at the margins of genteel culture. The Whitman who is being recalled is the poet of "Song of Myself," section 11. Stevens' complacent woman from section 1 of "Sunday Morning," the sign of Christian desire emerging first as a response to a leisured context of consumption, then modulated into the sign of a de- eroticized Keats, is now (in the blank space between sections 6 and 7) transformed into the poem's presiding point of view, the consciousness of Stevens himself in the mask of Whitman's wealthy, lonely, voyeuristic lady who imagines her/himself in the classic male position ("they do not ask who seizes fast to them, / They do not know who declines with pendant and bending arch"); who both dreams on the friendly twenty- eight young men bathing by the shore and "sees" the supple and turbulent men of "Sunday Morning" chant in orgy: "She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank, / She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window." Coming as it does on the heels of the Grecian-urn- dominated sixth section of "Sunday Morning," and its maliciously painful</page><page sequence="24">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 765 picture of religious paradise as unculminated Keatsian foreplay, the effect of "Sunday Morning" section 7 is to say to the "silly men" of Stevens' positively lady-like culture that poetry is Whitman, not Keats-masculine, not feminine, not asexual; that the poetic is nature reclaimed not as the great Mother creator, but as the Father phallic progenitor-and it says this with no poise of phallic confidence but out of desire for phallic confidence: not the domestic and the commodity-dominated, but the communal, the heavenly as phallic song-the music of nature as the sound of a phallic freedom that replaces the silence of disembodying Palestine. Not richly dressed, but naked: And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice The windy lake wherein their lord delights, The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills, That choir among themselves long afterward. In the final, eighth section of "Sunday Morning," as the prophetic voice proclaims the death of God, Stevens takes on Keats directly, creating his distance not by mocking what Keats has been made to stand for, but by crossing the breathless naturalism of Keats' closing lines in "To Autumn" with analogical music: the hard-earned particularities of Keats, so resistant to paraphrase, become in Stevens' response the eminently paraphrasable deer, quail, and sweet berries which ripen in the wilderness-all, as Vendler laments, "allegorical instances" of Nietzschean messages of fini- tude, freedom, and isolation.'4 Stevens' "casual flocks of pigeons" figure anxiety not for English nightingales, but for American waterfowl: the closing lines of "Sunday Morning" are a rewriting of the clear and hopeful teleological text of William Cullen Bryant's famous poem which Matthew Arnold, who understood the cultural power of literature when he saw it, called the finest lyric of the nineteenth century. As Stevens' pigeons descend into darkness they form a sign which, however ambiguous, calls for translation just as Bryant's waterfowl does and as Keats' swallows, gnats, and robins do not. Stevens' deployment of natural phenomena, in other words, is an instance of his rhetorical intentions, his "disguised pronunciamento," as he put it in "The Comedian as the Letter C." As a student at Harvard, he learned to distrust (in a thickening fin-de-siecle atmosphere) overtly moralizing art-exposed pronunciamento, as it were. He recoiled from Bryant and the Fireside group because, as he put it, the "New England school of poets were too hard thinkers. For them there was no pathos in the rose except as it went to point a moral or adorn a tale. I like my philosophy smothered in beauty and not the opposite."'" But we have to say back to Stevens that disguised pronun- 14. Helen Hennessy Vendler, On Extended Wings: Wallace Stevens' Longer Poems (Cam- bridge, 1969), p. 49. 15.

And he knew it. Aes- theticist theory-the "sensuous for the sake of sensuousness," perception for the sake of perception--Stevens found to be "the most arrant as it is the most inexcuseable rubbish." "Art," he argued, "must fit with other things; it must be part of the system of the world. And if it finds a place in that system it will likewise find a ministry and relation that are its proper adjuncts" (SP, p. 38). Vendler finds a desecrated (because covertly didactic) Keatsian voice at the end of "Sunday Morning," a voice that doesn't merely purr in sensuous revelry as Keats had in the autumn poem which Stevens evokes, but a voice that actually speaks to someone, is not merely "over-heard," and in so speaking conveys thought (formalist abomination) about the role of artistic sensuousness in a world in which young intellectuals of Stevens' time conceived of Jesus as a man who died, and his grave as no entrance, no "porch," but the end of the line. Stevens' modernism is not hostile to canonical modernism's twin bete noire: rhetoric and the will. He is not failing to become the Keats who has been idolized by anti-intellectual Keatsophantic formalists from Stedman to Cleanth Brooks to Vendler; he is trying to be a poet who, even though his American predecessor Fireside poets would have recoiled from his exotic lushness, would nevertheless succeed in assuming their mantle of cultural ministry-the cultural power that the Fireside poets had assumed for themselves and wielded throughout the American nineteenth century. It was the mantle of cultural authority, honor, and centrality that neither the economic nor the aesthetic culture of Stevens' young manhood- neither his father nor Stedman-could have recognized. The issue of Stevens' sexual identity as a writer-his effort to phallicize poetic discourse-is not just related to but just is the canonical modernist issue of poetic authority: the cultural power-or, increasingly, for the poetic modernist-the cultural powerlessness of poetry in a society that masculinized the economic while it feminized the literary. In the context of Stevens' America the nonutilitarian emphasis of aesthetics and literary theory since Kant and the early romantics -initially a badge of honor, a political protest, as Raymond Williams has shown,16 a critique of capitalist values on behalf of a higher usefulness in the healing of self-alienated bourgeois man (in Coleridge's definition of imagination's function: the unification of the whole soul of man)--increasingly this nonutilitarian emphasis in the modern idea of literature becomes no longer a badge of honor but, by the testimony of the modern poets themselves, the mark of poetry's social irrelevance. At the turn of the century in the United 16. See Raymond Williams, Culture and Society: 1780-1950 (New York, 1958).</page><page sequence="26">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 767 States and under the guidance of Stedman's genteel theories, feminization, social inutility, and poetic autonomy are just so many equatable ideas marking the marginalization of poetry in the name of the very modernism whose cultural ambition would be so very great, a modernism which would find, in Stevens' words, a "ministry" in the world. "Poetic autonomy"-not some sealed alcove but at once the sign of alienation felt by writers from Keats to Stedman and the sign of a critical desire to engage and shape society while being beholden to none of the institutions which degrade work and all human relations, especially those between men and women. The cultural discourse that Stevens was heir to en- couraged him to fantasize the potential social authority of the literary as phallic authority and to desire the endowing of social power to the poetic within a social formation that cannot itself permit such endowment. In the literary culture that Stevens would create, the "phallic" would not have been the curse word of some recent feminist criticism but the name of a limited, because male, respect for literature. The Harvard journal entry of 1899 which declares confidence in the eternal manliness of real poetry and the letter to Elsie Moll of 1914 which muses on the absurdity of his verse-writing habits, so lady-like, enclose two other letters to his wife-to-be, one of July 1908 in which manhood as an artist is seen as coincidental with major, canonical status, and another one of June 1911, in which he imaginatively sees himself cut down ar- tistically and sexually, by Gainsborough, for being a painter of fans. We gabbled about Michael Angelo-he, for-I, against. And don't you agree with me that if we could get the Michael Angeloes out of our heads-Shakespeare, Titian, Goethe-all the phenomenal men, we should find a multitude of lesser things (lesser but a multitude) to occupy us? It would be like withdrawing the sun and bringing out innumerable stars. I do not mean that the Michael Angeloes are not what they are-but I like Dr. Campion, I like Verlaine- water-colors, little statues, small thoughts. Let us leave the great things to the professors-substitute for majestic organs, sylvan reeds-such as the shepherds played on under cottage win- dows.... A fancy, at least. I need not agree with it to-morrow, if I do not care to.-But there are many fancies. They do not last. To-night, after dinner, for example, I thought I should like to play my guitar, so I dug it up from the bottom of my wardrobe, dusted it, strummed a half-dozen chords, and then felt bored by it. I have played those half-dozen chords so often. I wish I were gifted enough to learn a new half-dozen.-Some day I may be like one of the old ladies with whom I lived in Cambridge, who played a hymn on her guitar. The hymn had thousands of verses, all alike. She played about two hundred every night-until the house-dog whined for mercy and liberty. [L, pp. 110-11]</page><page sequence="27">768 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens ... my trifling poesies are like the trifling designs one sees on fans. I was much shocked, accordingly, to read of a remark made by Gainsborough, the great painter of portraits and landscapes. He said scornfully of some one, "Why, the man is a painter of fans!"-Well, to be sure, a painter of fans is a very unimportant person by the side of the Gainsboroughs. [L, p. 171] To get Michelangelo and Shakespeare and all "phenomenal men" out of your head means self-consciously choosing minority (lesser things, little statues, small thoughts) in full awareness, with one's eyes on what constitutes majority: on precisely what you fear you do not have-the majestic organ of a phenomenal man. And Stevens' confident wit can neither cover up nor take the place of his imagined lack of vocal size because wit of his kind has historically been the sort of low virtue that poets substitute when, for whatever reasons, the big high serious subject is just not available. The poetics of minority in Stevens is inaugurated with the imagination of insufficiency. To get Michelangelo and Shakespeare out of your head means banishing the sun for the stars, it means choosing the pastoral-not culture and the city, the traditional province of the long poem and the poet of epic ambition. It means becoming like one of those old ladies he lived with in Cambridge who played thousands of verses on her guitar but with the added gift for innumerable variations so that the house-dog would not whine for mercy and liberty: small but multitudinous pleasures. The withdrawn sun returns in "Sunday Morning" along with some phenomenal men in pastoral context; the guitar and the poetry of theme and endless variations will return in the first of many efforts in Stevens' later manner to write the long poem, a major poetry, "The Man with the Blue Guitar." But to become minor and to like it is never to title a poem "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction" and in so doing tell all that you feel small, but can imagine a big thing. To become minor and to like it is never to have to call your poems "poesies," or to characterize them as "trifling," or to think of what one does-what makes one what one is-as similar to an expendable item of luxury that ends up, like a fan, in the hands of leisured ladies. Or worse yet: not even a fan but a decoration on a fan. It is never to put your manhood into jeopardy by letting yourself be the wimp who was put down by Gainsborough. To think well of yourself as a minor light is never, with all editorial time virtually run out, to write in panic to your publisher, Alfred Knopf, and tell him to change the title of your first volume to The Grand Poem: Preliminary Minutiae (see L, p. 237). If it is possible to condense the anxieties of a career into one line it would be this one from "Sunday Morning": "She makes the willow shiver in the sun." That may be the central line of the poem because it speaks of a desire to make a delicate and subtle moment of perception and</page><page sequence="28">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 769 perceptual pleasure into a grand and urgent thing: the redemption of our lonely finitude. The line projects an image while celebrating, implicitly, and at the same time, the possibilities and values of the image as medium of perceptual acuteness; it urges the necessity of perceptual acuteness because it is the antithetical major clause which completes a long series of piled up subordinate phrases of depressing implication; death is the enabler of the percept, and the percept in natural context, borne and preserved by the image, makes it all bearable: Although she strews the leaves Of sure obliteration on our paths, The path sick sorrow took, the many paths Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love Whispered a little out of tenderness, She makes the willow shiver in the sun. That last line blends the urge of aesthetic minority, a poetics of small pastoral impressions, with the commanding rhetorical tone of the cultural medicine man who has been entrusted with a culture's well-being-as if the fate of society depended upon what Stevens later would call the "yes" that is uttered after "the final no," a little thing, "No greater than a cricket's horn" or a "pretty phrase.""17 With Pound and Eliot, no other modern American poet believed that what his society thought so "little" of (as in "belittle") might mean so much. There is evidence to suggest that what pushed the marriage of Elsie Moll and Wallace Stevens in the wrong direction, at least from her point of view, was his decision to publish the "secrets" of his poetic character that he had once entrusted her with: those little hand-made volumes of verses, written as special gifts of courtship. The poems were their bond. The poems-the act of writing them and the act of giving them to a womanly audience of one-brought Stevens and Elsie together by giving life to what his father and the culture his father mediated for him would have called the "woman" within Elsie's suitor. In the private place where Stevens felt that he could be himself, the poems were an expression both of domestic tranquility and of his feeling of himself, as individual, that he could not separate from the domestic site of that feeling: "I certainly do not exist," he wrote to her before they were married, "from nine to six, when I am at the office. There is no everyday Wallace, apart from the one at work-and that one is tedious.-At night I strut my individual state once more" ("WS," p. 42). Until he went public with his poetry Stevens had not violated the sentimental norms of cultural femininity, but had accepted them in perhaps a more radical fashion than even America's sentimental novelists had accepted them. They published; they sold in big numbers; the "damned mob of scribbling women" made 17. Stevens, "The Well Dressed Man with a Beard."</page><page sequence="29">770 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens money, as Hawthorne wrote with some envy. In effect, Stevens told his wife-to-be, I am complete when the values of hearth, home, and poetry are united at the site of our living together. This is one way to read his correspondence with Elsie Moll, the woman he addressed in his letters as his "country girl," his "little girl," his "lady," his "Queen," his "Princess," his "second self," his "Muse," and his "Bo-peep," which he sometimes conflated with "Pete," his nickname in college-"Bo-pete" ("WS," pp. 45, 48, 54). Stevens knew himself well enough to describe the act of writing to Elsie as an act of "self-communion" ("WS," p. 42). To go public with his poetry (from her point of view) is to breach the alliance of poetry, home, love and marriage, and to dishonor the bond, to betray her and himself, the two that should be one, and therefore to betray the marriage itself by exposing little Bo-peep-exposing Elsie, his "Muse," the poetic-as- pastoral-as-feminine-to the world of men and power, and in such betrayal (now his point of view) convert the poetic into the pastoral as masculine: the major, the canonical, ministry in the world. As lover and husband, as economic man and aesthetic man, Stevens occupied the contradictions of his culture. There is an emancipatory implication in his unhappiness as a young man, and the story of his early life and career sometimes tells a tale of radical social discontent. Even in the economic and sexual terms through which I have tried to give some coherence to Stevens' story, I find coherence, in the end, elusive. But maybe that kind of effort to make sense of "Sunday Morning" and Stevens' young manhood makes its strongest historical and political statement right there: the points where interpretive coherence fails turn out to be, at least for this reader, the very points where, as Stevens begins to lose his command of rhetoric and argument, his poem takes an un- expected turn. For example, Stevens naturalizes the commodity without seeming to be aware that he is doing so, converting the lady's oranges and cockatoo into "comforts of the sun" ("pungent fruit and bright green wings"). And that sort of forgetting of the labor process that produced her comforts is surely socially representative forgetting, especially on Sundays when Christians give thanks, but generally not to their fellow human beings. It is rather the next move-from commodity to so-called comforts of the sun and then to the line, "Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven"-that most intrigues me because it is the beginning of the undoing of the poem's overt rhetoric. In the traditional reading of "Sunday Morning" which pits poet against yearning woman, macho existentialist against repressed feminine religiosity, the specific "Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven" are "things" of an earthly paradise that is supposed to be an alternative</page><page sequence="30">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 771 to old-fashioned heaven: "things," in this poem's insistently debunking materialist rhetoric, are supposed to take the place of "thought" of an immaterial place, even of the immaterial place itself. But neither earthly "things" nor the possibility of naturalized subjectivity, however lushly evoked as "Passions of rain," can grant sufficient solace for the lady: she wants "imperishable bliss"; she seems to know, to continue a little longer with this fiction that the poem is a dialogue between a male and a female voice, that "things" like the thought of heaven are only "like"-substitutive satisfactions (in Freud's phrase), and so never wholly satisfactory. She continues to yearn and "her" yearning in two crucial places becomes "his." In those two moments the fiction of antithetical male and female dialogue is exploded. The poet becomes "lady-like," his rhetoric loses its naturalistic ground and begins to levitate toward what it most wishes to debunk. The first spot of rhetorical unsettlement occurs in the foggy allegory of section 3. Jove, poor Jove, didn't have a mother to suckle him; another god, whose name also begins with a J, did: his death mustn't, however, become a reason to mourn his absence (he never was); it should rather be the celebrating occasion of our creative presence (we made him). When we realize that, then the sky, a "between" place, which some say divides us from heaven, becomes part of our place, the one and only place-"A part of labor and a part of pain / ... / Not this dividing and indifferent blue." In the poem's overt philosophical intention, the two lines I have just quoted make perfect, summarizing sense. But there is a line between those two that I've deliberately omitted and that makes sense neither in my little allegory of the history of the gods, nor in the poem's general orientation. The line reads: "And next in glory to enduring love." Endurances (with the special exception of endurances of seasonal change) are what this poem is against. Stevens sets them in the context of feminine desire in order to denigrate them. Yet this line asserts the glory of one particular, imagined endurance and says that enduring love would bring ultimate fulfillment. And more: the line not only asserts the ultimate value of enduring love, it compares enduring love to what is not strictly comparable with it-glorious earthly paradises of change. "Enduring love" is not just more glorious than that-it is the earth's negation, the very thing that he would choose if such love were a matter of choice, and a metonymic stand-in for all negations (like traditional religion) that would replace earth with heaven. In an essential way, the poem becomes confusing and this confusion can be focused in the com- parative "next in glory," which posits a continuity of natural and ideal values, and implies the happy proposition that all choices are in some sense good choices, when in fact Stevens is arguing the opposite: for discontinuity of natural and ideal realms and the unhappy proposition that only one choice is a good one. The irony of the comparative is that</page><page sequence="31">772 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens it puts the values of the lady in the mouth of her rhetorical antagonist at the moment when he is trying to sustain his contrary discourse. The initial occurrence of "Death is the mother of beauty" (in section 5) appears to swing the poem back on track by negating the great feminine negation ("enduring love"), but the second elaborated occurrence of this aphorism at the end of section 6 reinstates the so-called female desire for enduring love in the figure of the mother (Stevens' mother died three years before the publication of "Sunday Morning"): Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, Within whose burning bosom we devise Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly. Stevens' biography here erupts into the poem, making him speak against his poem's male/female contest of voices, making him conceive his readers as radically like him-an audience composed wholly of bereft children, specifically of bereft males, sons who have all lost their mothers and who are all projecting their mothers on the other side of death waiting for them in transcendental space, worrying, refusing to sleep until they (we) come safely home. I read the aphorism "Death is the mother of beauty" in its second appearance this way: My mother's death is the mother of beauty, my mother's death is itself a mother-a substitute mother that shocks me, as all death must, into cherishing the earth. My mother's death is therefore the birth of my imagination, the necessary angel of earth, yes, but I have only one mother and this substitute does not suffice. I need to see her again, my real mother, whose death enabled the birth of my poems, knowing that I cannot. So I will invent her there, "devise" her waiting for me-in heaven, site of all enduring love. The full-throated phallic song of earth (section 7) follows, now all the more powerfully when we see what it is that Stevens is trying to forget. He knew that you can't get your mother back, even if she's not dead, and he also knew that you can, if you're male, find a pretty good substitutive satisfaction for her: This has been a busy &amp; therefore a profitable week. Tonight I received no assignment &amp; so I am in my room. I almost said at home-God forbid! The proverbial apron-strings have a devil of a firm hold on me &amp; as a result I am unhappy at such a distance from the apron. I wish a thousand times a day that I had a wife- which I never shall have, and more's the pity for I am certainly a domestic creature, par excellence. It is brutal to myself to live alone .... I don't know-sometime I may marry after all. Of course I am too young now etc. as people go-but I begin to feel the vacuum that wives fill. This will probably make poor reading to a</page><page sequence="32">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 773 future bachelor. Wife's an old word-which does not express what I mean-rather a delightful companion who would make a fuss over me. [SP, pp. 81-82] The story of Stevens' early life and career sometimes tells a tale that it doesn't appear to know it is telling, of discontent radical not in the usual senses of left politics but in the etymological sense, "radical" because such discontent is alleviated only by a return to the origin, by a son's desire for his mother's breast that would, if granted, simply set aside all of his male obligations in the bourgeois world of capital. Reflections on Essentialist Feminism I began with a distinction between biological and social engenderment that has nearly become the de rigueur departure for feminist cultural analyses. "Femininity" and "masculinity," to say it again, are internally linked social constructions of basic biological difference. The purpose of this act of construction, if I can speak of a social process as having intention, is the conversion of biological difference into hierarchical op- position. Social constructions of gender (or of anything else) are freighted with ideological content which varies historically, geographically, and culturally, even though the positional relation of one gender to the other (the relation of domination) appears to remain constant. History, in other words, as repetitious sexist drama: the authors of The Madwoman in the Attic are not unconvincing when they claim a radical coherence of all writings by women. But in a spirited, sympathetic, and (to me, at least) mostly persuasive deflation of a number of major American and French feminist literary reputations, Toril Moi, a Marxist-feminist, makes in her book Sexual/Textual Politics just the sort of point that Gilbert and Gubar will occasionally make in theory but cannot live by: It has long been an established practice among most feminists to use 'feminine' (and 'masculine') to represent social constructs (patterns of sexuality and behaviour imposed by cultural and social norms), and to reserve 'female' and 'male' for the purely biological aspects of sexual difference. . ... 'Femininity' is a cultural construct: one isn't born a woman, one becomes one, as Simone de Beauvoir puts it. Seen in this perspective, patriarchal oppression consists of im- posing certain social standards of femininity on all biological women, in order precisely to make us believe that the chosen standards for 'femininity' are natural. Thus a woman who refuses to conform can be labelled both unfeminine and unnatural. It is in the patriarchal interest that these two terms (femininity and femaleness) stay thor-</page><page sequence="33">774 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens oughly confused. Feminists, on the contrary, have to disentangle this confusion.18 Moi's statement seems right on target, but a very small part of it may conceal a disabling contradiction in the writings of the most well-known American literary feminists, their followers, and in the work of a younger wave of feminists who are at the verge of open revolt against their mothers. I notice that Moi relegates masculinity to a parenthesis and then proceeds to elaborate her theory with respect only to the cultural genealogy of femininity, with respect to what was and is being done to women. Par- enthetical masculinity in Moi's discourse signifies a certain equality with femininity, both being social creations and not conditions of nature. But the parenthetical can function as an expendable afterthought and in too much feminist criticism that is exactly the fate of the "masculine," however rhetorically understandable that may be given the history of sexism which is hard, of course, to distinguish from history. The impression that Moi and many of her sisters leave (though Moi knows better) is that women are history's privileged victims: as if the female is subjected to social construction by a maleness that operates out of a socially uncontaminated free space; as if male authority to oppress is a one-way street; as if male power stands outside the arena of oppression as its originating god-the- father-of-patriarchy: serene, monolithic, omnipotent, natural, coolly paring its mandarin fingernails. The logic of Moi's statement demands that I say that I wasn't born a man, I became one. Seen in this perspective, patriarchal oppression also consists of imposing certain social standards of masculinity on all biological men, in order precisely to make us believe that the chosen standards for masculinity are natural. A man who refuses to conform can be labeled both unmasculine and unnatural (or lady-like, as Stevens labeled himself). It is in the patriarchal interest that the two terms (mas- culinity and male) stay thoroughly confused. Cultural critics of both sexes interested in the issue of liberation need to disentangle this confusion as well. You probably can't help but notice that in my replay of Moi's statement I am trying for a pithy summary of the theoretical point, and its implied polemic, submerged in my reading of the early career of Wallace Stevens. And you can't help but notice a certain absurdity in what I've said in my revision of Moi-an absurdity embedded in patriarchy itself, which I'll try to disentangle this way: the ancient social process called "patriarchy" consists also in the oppression of patriarchs; the "interest" of patriarchy lies also in the confusion of men, in teaching men who will not conform 18.

Gayle Greene and Coppelia Kahn (London, 1985) for a number of pieces which work outside the essentialist mode.</page><page sequence="34">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 775 how to alienate and despise themselves, and even men who do conform. A little deconstruction goes a long way. Patriarchy against itself dismantles itself from within, its intention overridden, captured and wounded by the very structure of sexual relations it would set in place and manipulate. Patriarchy does not and cannot understand the self-subverting conse- quences of what it conceives (to use Moi's word) as its "interest." If we can speak of a social process as having intention, then we have to follow through and say that it also has an unconscious. If history, as Gilbert and Gubar argue, is a repetitious sexist drama (not easy to argue otherwise) with men in the plot-controlling role of the oppressor, and women in the role of selfless victim, then history may be in danger of being translated by some of our most influential feminists into manichean allegory and the very category that Moi and others invoke in order to explain the transformation of biology into history-she calls it, interchangeably, the "social" or the "cultural"-this category will be banished almost as quickly as it is invoked. With the social banished behind the scenes, history begins to look very much again like biology, biology like metaphysics, and the writing of feminist literary criticism like a ritual of scapegoating propelled by paranoia. At some destructive level history does look like manichean sexual allegory because the biological difference does make a difference. It is in the interests of patriarchy (not feminism) to convince us that that difference is the only difference that can make a difference; the critical method proper to patriarchy (not feminism) is naturalistic, ahistorical: a formalism of gender. In The Madwoman in the Attic (1979) Gilbert and Gubar produce (in this order) a feminist poetics, a reading of literature by English women through the nineteenth century, with special emphasis on novelists, and, in a substantial closing section, a reading of nineteenth-century poetry by women, with special emphasis on Emily Dickinson: all of this-700 pages' worth-as prelude to a study of literature by women in the twentieth century, in the context of modernism, a book they call, with no hint of dystopian depression, No Man's Land-the absurd negative of Stevens' absurd no woman's land. In addition, Gilbert and Gubar have recently published what is being talked about (not without heated debate) as a definitive anthology of women's literature (but not quite: "the tradition in English," as they call it), under the imprimatur of Norton-in matters anthological, the hegemonic house of college collections of literature. Since the publication of The Madwoman in the Attic, Gilbert has taken off from her pages on Dickinson and nineteenth-century poetry by women and has begun to write on the course of American poetry, with her point of departure a comparative treatment of Whitman and Dickinson and her object a theory about the sexual shape of modernist poetry in America. Stevens is one of her favorite modernist examples. Beginning with an often compelling but I think fatally flawed account of patriarchal power and its metaphor of authority, ownership, and the</page><page sequence="35">776 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens pen as penis--patriarchy's celebration of male autonomy, akin to God the Father Almighty--Gilbert and Gubar end with a visionary assertion of matriarchal power and its metaphors of authority, ownership, and (ultimate mixed metaphor) the pen as vagina: a celebration of female autonomy, God the Mother Almighty. Gilbert and Gubar use the terms female and feminine interchangeably, with a preference for "female," as Moi notes with exasperation, thereby tipping us off to their central assumption which Gilbert calls "bracingly ontological."'1 Here and there in The Madwoman in the Attic there is some drift from the happy metaphysics of feel-good ontology, toward the social ground of sexual role construction, but in the main they stick to the traditional philosophical meaning of ontology. For Gilbert and Gubar the male and the female constitute two autonomous, really separate realms of being. The self-coherent identity that patriarchy presumably enjoys, in their imagination of patriarchy, haunts the image of woman that they fashion. Their understanding of patriarchy emerges most clearly not when they treat it directly but as they construct their envious counterideal, the flip side of the patri- archal coin in liberal society: the self-coherent and self-creating woman writer-hiding behind the self-renunciatory posture that patriarchy forces her to take: woman as she should be, after the "renewal of our lives" which literary study in Gilbert's feminist mode is supposed to make happen (see "FC," p. 44). There is, or will be (Gilbert and Gubar slide around on this point) not a, not many, but "the female imagination," a favorite phrase of theirs, which is the source for the single archetypal tale that woman tells, because she must tell, her gender so dictates, and that Charlotte Perkins Gilman has already told in paradigmatic form in a short story called "The Yellow Wallpaper."20 "The female imagination" authorizes woman's literary au- tonomy. But what exactly is the female imagination and the supposed literary autonomy of woman that it authorizes? Like patriarchal theorists before them, Gilbert and Gubar gloss female imagination and female literary autonomy with sexual autonomy. Biology is the ground of unique psychic difference. In their discourse "sexual autonomy" is translated variously and repeatedly with a series of metonymies like "interiority" and "subjectivity": "her own autonomy, her own interiority" "her stubborn autonomy and unknowable subjectivity" "her subjectivity, her autonomy, her creativity" 19.

But stubborn autonomy (and now the Bloomian chickens come home to roost) is anxious autonomy, not sure of itself: no autonomy at all, as Bloom knows. "Her" subjectivity (or autonomy or interiority or creativity: they are the same) is knowable only to herself and to other women like Gilbert and Gubar who are its privileged interpreters. It is by definition unknowable to men who are closed out by the terms of Gilbert and Gubar's manichean sexual ontology. So my first general point about The Madwoman in the Attic is that though patriarchy and matriarchy differ in spelling only by a single letter, in the visionary discourse of Gilbert and Gubar they often differ not at all. For it is not just rhetorical emphasis but real commitment to the presiding metaphor of patriarchy that comes through the leitmotiv her own, her own, her own. Females own themselves in the interior (their private property), which no patriarchal male (a redundancy), no matter how much real estate he owns, can ever take away. Cunning patriarchs, of course, are pleased to permit the sisters to own their interiors. To insist on autonomy and ownership, as Gilbert and Gubar do, is bluntly to insist on the values of the phallus that patriarchy invents. My second point about The Madwoman in the Attic is that its unintended identification of matriarchy and patriarchy is identity with a familiar difference. The claim that Gilbert and Gubar make on behalf of the female writer rests on their inability to keep from assenting to what they do not want to assent to, a keystone premise of patriarchal thought that grants the male the natural authority of reason and the female the natural debilitation of reason known as emotion which the male (woman-born) is afflicted with but can transcend through the discipline of dialectical exercise: in the classical world it was called philosophy. I am rehearsing the old platonic foundation of Western thought and its distinguishing and generative opposition of male to female which produces other op- positions, like that of philosophy to the mimetic arts of poetry, objectivity to subjectivity, and, in the political realm, the opposition significantly enhanced and reconstituted in the bourgeois era of sexism of a public sphere of action (civil involvement, economic pursuits, government) and a private sphere of domesticity where women, when they are not engaged in nurturing activities that prepare the male for his public life of "signifi- cant action," can indulge in "contemplative purity" in the pursuit of poetry, religion, and other opiates of the lady's world (M, pp. 21, 24, 25, 28, 42). On numerous occasions Gilbert and Gubar express their repugnance for this last variant of patriarchal thinking, but at a deep theoretical level they accept it with gusto. In a crucial passage, in an effort to deflect an</page><page sequence="37">778 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens inescapable critique of their method-a method which says that there are themes in women's writing not to be found in men's-they disarmingly grant the critique, allow that men, too, have dramatized the same themes, like feelings of imprisonment and escape. But then, almost in the same breath, Gilbert and Gubar attempt to recoup their notion of a unique female thematics with the stunning assertion that men like Donne, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, Keats, Poe, Dickens, and Tennyson can deal with such themes "more consciously and objectively than the female writer can." When they write about imprisonment and escape, men are really writing about impersonal matters of theology, epistemology, the nature of the psyche-they might be making, as Byron does in "The Prisoner of Chillon," "a political point about the tyranny of the state." Moreover, "though male metaphors of imprisonment have obvious im- plications in common ... such metaphors may have very different aesthetic functions and philosophical messages in different male literary works." Women writers, Gilbert and Gubar believe, have trouble being objective and unemotional, really write about themselves, about the personal as the private, about what has actually gone on in their lives. Since all women have essentially lived one life, all women writers have.the same "unconscious and conscious purpose"-the telling over and over again of the same tale of "their own distinctively female experience" (a literature of their own) (M, p. 87). It requires only modest critical generosity to envision the transfor- mation of Gilbert and Gubar's sexist ontology of despair into historical categories that offer a little hope for change. Their examples of male privilege can often be coaxed to speak for another conclusion. Thus: it is historical rather than biological privilege and dominance that grants men the socially produced "freedom" of an "objective" stance in the world, while historical oppression has forced women into obsessive and repetitive inwardness, an apparent archetypal unity of experience (the "same conscious and unconscious purpose"), the option of the public sphere and its liberating variousness having been historically inaccessible to them. Male "health" and female "madness" are products of this social arrangement. Traditional male writers can take epistemology, theology, and politics as subjects because traditionally males have had the option, mainly denied women, to enter the public domain, as theologians, clergy, politicians, and philosophers. In other words, if the problem is primarily political then there is a reason for feminism, and the political actors who would alleviate the problem should call themselves feminists, rather than, say, genderists, because feminism better names and has historically so named the problem. On the other hand, to go with Gilbert and Gubar's ontological construction of the issue is to say that there is no political solution to biological warfare. To write the sentences I've just written with even modest self-consciousness is to realize how dated they are. They are dated because feminism in the twentieth century, in its official</page><page sequence="38">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 779 and implicit forms-practiced without notice by fellow travelers-has been doing its work. Even the most schematic account of the changing faces of patriarchy, with attention to its aesthetic dimension, will tell us something about the socially specific but unexamined underpinnings of The Madwoman in the Attic. Let's try this schema: with his argument on behalf of the contemplative attitude that he thought poetry encouraged, Aristotle in the Poetics wished to demonstrate that poetry was like unto reason, the very reason aspired to by ruling-class men but endangered according to Aristotle's predecessor by mimetic poetry, a womanish sort of thing which watered and fed the passions. Aristotle argued that the distance of tragic drama from its existential and biographical sources-its imposition, in the form of plot, of casual order upon those sources-underwrites its ability to expel emo- tion. Mimetic poetry could, after all, play a role in the education of (male) leaders-Aristotle, a man of his times, thought woman defective in the soul, so unfit to lead. Mimetic poetry need not be censored in the city- state, after all, because its function was to assist the birth of reason and the production of rational knowledge: precisely Plato's theory about the function of nonmimetic poetry. Numerous of Aristotle's Renaissance heirs in Italy and England (Mazzoni and Sidney are exemplary instances) did not miss the point that Gramsci and other Marxists would make centuries later: they would affirm in ingenious detail that the poetic genres played a necessary political role in the sustaining of hierarchical social order-the training of ruling-class leaders, the consoling of the underclasses. The genres could help to make the state safe for the status quo. If the typical position of Renaissance Aristotelianism is that poetry sustains dominant political power by playing the conservative role of cultural enforcer, then somewhere in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (there are many theories about this so-called historical break) and with a vengeance in the nineteenth century, whose literary terrain preoccupies Gilbert and Gubar, the aesthetic is theorized as an adversarial cultural agency, a potential voice of revolution directed not (of course) against the classical city-state or feudal society but (the evidence is too ample to need citing) against the social world invented by capitalism and everything, including patriarchy, which sustains and forwards its purposes by a life of "significant action." Contemplation, the imagination, and renunciation are poised against action, the will, and ownership, by mostly male poets and theorists from Shelley to Yeats, not for the better education of the new patriarchal authorities of capitalism, but for the subversion of capitalist powers and values altogether. The beauty and goodness of selflessness, which Gilbert and Gubar read as a patriarchal plot to imprison women, was a favorite idea of male romantics who would have been stunned to learn that their talk about selflessness and negative capability proved that they were really repressed women or secret feminists</page><page sequence="39">780 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens made so by capitalist pressures. They thought they were putting poetry on the side of the human (both sexes) as weapon against the dehumanization wrought by the new capitalist order. The fierce hegemonic strength of capitalism was quickly proven, however, in the patriarchal appropriation, virtually simultaneous with the growth of romantic alienation, of romantic rejectionist aesthetic. The aesthetic of contemplation, imagination, in- teriority, subjectivity, and renunciation was soon encircled, then converted into bourgeois value. So this is the fate of Kantian disinterest: the essentials of romantic aesthetic were like unto a passive and presumably nonpro- ductive woman. Tennyson's "The Palace of Art," a major Victorian expression of (and lament for) the feminization of culture, a poem clearly behind the writing of "Sunday Morning," alluded to many times by Gilbert and Gubar as metaphor for patriarchal economic and aesthetic power (they call it an overwhelmingly male palace of art), this palace is the place of a stagnant, inactive female soul. But Tennyson's private female soul, synecdoche for all leisured females, is also a metonymy for all male artists-that was the cultural lesson of capitalism most deeply embedded in his poem (see M, p. xi). Tennyson's guilt is of his class-he should have been doing his duty in the foreign service, or some such ruling-class career. His guilt is also the sign of capitalism's victory over the aristocracy: it had captured the aesthetic and turned it into the shame of those (male and female both) who traditionally practiced the poetic arts. Against Tennyson's ruling- class shame we might set the working-class anger of Whitman, who thought Keats betrayed his humble origins by trying to sound like some privileged college gentleman who lived in libraries, fed off his father's inheritance, and constantly dropped the names of the gods and goddesses of twenty- five hundred years ago. Whitman, who thought Tennyson an asexual wimp, revolted against the feminization of poetry not with a life of sig- nificant economic action-the wisdom of his class-but in the name of poetry and the class (his own)-in the name of the masses-for whom the male poets (who hung out at Cambridge) or the lady poets (Twain's cloistered attendants on the deathbed) never spoke and who were pro- viding the arms and legs of industrial capitalism. Thus, my third general point about the authors of The Madwoman in the Attic is that their failure to specify the social and economic ground of the feminization of literary activity leads them to posit a hostility of so-called male and female literary traditions that runs contrary to the unified relegation of male and female poets to thejunkheap of uselessness, or to the uses of leisure time (weekend) entertainment in the culture of capitalism in the nineteenth century and in our day. The "feminization" of the literary that occurred under the social conditions of capitalism in the nineteenth century bears heavily on men, especially in the United States on middle-class men of literary bent. The reason for this is not that capitalist ruling-class conspirators met behind closed doors in order to instruct their cultural agents to</page><page sequence="40">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 781 feminize the literary; the reason is that middle-class males of "culture" are virtually by definition, in a capitalist environment, the chief architects and agents of cultural feminization; architects, therefore, of their own schizophrenia, and the career of Wallace Stevens-which falls socially be- tween the embarrassment of Tennyson and the resentment of Whitman- is something like a proof. My fourth general point about The Madwoman in the Attic is that its authors naturalize the mainly comfortable and mostly privileged economic situations of their favorite nineteenth-century women writers. In so doing, they sometimes forget or repress and at other times appear deliberately to want to trivialize the different and not-so-comfortable economic situations of other writers, male and female. Their preoccupation with biology as the supposed ground of psychic difference of "Woman" with a capital letter leads them to elide the social origins of sexual-role differences. They like to start with a psychosexual proposition, mention the social in lip service, and then leap to the literary, which is supposedly both mirror and epiphenomenon of the psychosexual. In their preface, Gilbert and Gubar say this: "For not only did a nineteenth-century woman have to inhabit ancestral mansions (or cottages) owned and built by men, she was also constricted and restricted by the Palaces of Art and Houses of Fiction male writers authored" (M, p. xi). For the nineteenth-century women writers they treat, that goes almost without saying (especially the part about inhabiting those mansions). But what of the men and women writers-and nonwriters-who did and do live in cities, not in pastoral splendor, in dwellings owned neither by their fathers nor by their husbands or lovers or uncles or aunts? Gilbert and Gubar write movingly of the psychic suffering of privileged women, but they have so little grasp of the cultural advantages that such women (or men) have who happen to be fortunate enough to live in mansions or cottages owned and built by men-to whom they are related by blood or marriage-that they are led to the surprising generalization that upper-class women have been, in their words, "denied the economic, social, and psychological status ordinarily essential to creativity," and "denied the right, skill, and education to tell their own stories with confidence" (M, p. 71). They are right: It is a fact that women of all classes in the nineteenth century did not enjoy the social and political status that men enjoyed, but it seems unnecessarily insensitive to women and men from unprivileged backgrounds to say that women of the upper classes were denied the economic and social state essential to creativity just because upper-class men had advantages they didn't have. What is beneath this view of the plight of upper-class women is the great animating myth of essentialist feminism: that a poor man always has it better than a rich woman. Women's psychological status, in the light of Gilbert and Gubar's theory of a totalitarian patriarchy, is less than conducive to creativity-though the brute fact of what Haw- thorne called the "damned mob of scribbling women" implies a less</page><page sequence="41">782 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens efficient patriarchy than Gilbert and Gubar would allow or, to give the point a Foucauldian twist, a patriarchy that wanted to produce in the nineteenth century a hegemonic sentimentalist discourse, not silence. Their point that women can't tell their stories with confidence is probably true. On the other hand, we have learned from Bloom that lack of confidence is the hallmark of the so-called male tradition. Bloom or no Bloom, the writer who tells his or her story (or anything) with easeful confidence is a rarity: probably more a rarity among women writers, though I would be surprised if Alice Walker and Jane Austen are equal sisters in insecurity. The canonical women writers Gilbert and Gubar treat were without exception not denied the social and economic status that marks the English literary tradition, nor were they denied the skill and education to write the novel of manners, or poems (like Emily Dickinson's) that knowingly draw on the Bible, the English metaphysicals, and Emerson, among other difficult and highly literate sources. Austen and Dickinson have nothing in common with working-class and middle-class women and men who were and are on the margins of literacy, who had to put out in sweatshops and came home too exhausted to do much of anything, much less write novels with titles like Mansfield Park or The Portrait of a Lady. Gilbert and Gubar's notion of underprivileged women, "the less gifted sisters" as they phrase it (and let us note the naturalizing metaphor of "gift"), consists of those whose pressing needs forced them "to go out into the world as governesses." The fact, much insisted upon by Gilbert and Gubar, that women who are denied a classical education at Oxford and Cambridge may have been handicapped in the contest for the lyric laurels, may have felt forced to write prose fiction because it did not demand a classical education (so they argue), these facts cannot deny the overriding fact that Austen, the Brontes, and George Eliot were educated sufficiently to write what have become classics of English fiction, while others of the brothers and sisters were not. Dickinson, they finally admit, was notforced to lock herself up in her room. Exactly: most women and men don't have the privilege of being crazy in that way. Gilbert and Gubar allow that any "moderately intelligent young woman" in New England "seeking independence" could have become the equivalent of an English governess (an American "schoolmarm"); there were other careers besides writing, but "moderate intelligence" is only one of the conditions of that option and being a schoolteacher in nineteenth-century America was rarely an option for the underprivileged (M, p. 558). The aristocratic social model simply saturates the analyses found in The Madwoman in the Attic and blinds its authors to any other sort of social experience and any other sort of literature not rooted in the English country house. Gilbert's visions are literally visions of "lords" and their "beautiful stately ladies" whose obligation is to "silence." Here is Gilbert describing her awakening to a gathering of English department chairmen: "The treasures of Western culture, it began to seem, were the patrimony</page><page sequence="42">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 783 of male writers, or to put it another way, Western culture itself was a grand ancestral property that educated men had inherited from their intellectual forefathers, while their female relatives, like characters in a Jane Austen novel, were relegated to modest dower houses on the edge of the estate." The point, I guess, is to get to the center of the estate, to get into the mansion-own it yourself. Wherever the writers of the stories of shopgirls are situated-those stories were to be the future of fiction, Virginia Woolf argued, because the middle class was the future of soci- ety-those writers were not situated there, at the edge of the estate: especially if we can imagine the tellers of those tales of unprivileged life as themselves coming from the unprivileged classes ("FC," pp. 34, 33). All of which brings us at last to Gilbert's theory of American po- etry--"classless" in a way Marx never dreamed. Whitman and Dickinson are her originating giants, the father and mother of male modernist and female modernist American poets. And they are originals in at least two senses. They are first of all Americans who are original as America itself is original--historically belated in relation to English and continental societies; they are also would-be original poets who find themselves not only belated vis-a-vis European poetic traditions but also alienated from the Anglophiles within, the American poets of Fireside fame (Bryant, Longfellow, and so on). Whitman and Dickinson were so alienated from the poetic norms of the day, Gilbert argues, that they both wrote what their contemporaries and Gilbert call "not poetry." Whitman and Dickinson are the first expression in poetry, then, of Emerson's call for an American literature not tuned into the courtly muses of Europe. But they are different, too: Whitman came out of a problematic working-class family, while Dickinson was born into a genteel and financially solid situation, 'just the sort of cultivated New England family which fostered the careers of men like Bryant, Lowell, and Emerson": she was from "the right class," Gilbert admits, "a privileged daughter, a sort of Yankee princess." But these differences of social, economic, and cultural origin are quickly done away with. Ontologically bracing psychosexual theories have no use for the sociological perspective that Gilbert occasionally lets herself indulge. Whitman's feelings of marginality might be traced to social sources, but then so could Dickinson's. Genteel daughters could be well-read, but they were taught lady-like reticence in matters of publication. (Maybe they were supposed to keep quiet, but our literary history in the nineteenth century shows that many overcame literary repression with a vengeance and loosed a tidal wave of language.) Gilbert concludes that Dickinson must have found herself in a position of "privileged marginality not unlike Whitman's."2' So what seems like an important social difference is really a social sameness: Whitman and Dickinson were both marginalized 21. Gilbert, "The American Sexual Poetics of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson," in Reconstructing American Literary History, ed. Sacvan Bercovitch, Harvard English Studies 13 (Cambridge, Mass., 1986), pp. 128, 133, 134-35, 138-39.</page><page sequence="43">784 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens by their social experiences, however different those experiences were, and we can safely ignore their social origins altogether because they were led by different routes to what Gilbert thinks were the same feelings of alienation. Would the sexual difference of gender that distinguishes Whitman and Dickinson itself have had different consequences had their family contexts been reversed? Would a working-class Emily Dickinson have written at all? These questions cannot be pursued within Gilbert's framework of assumptions. The critical method of patriarchy, the formalism of gender, ahistorical, naturalistic, is the critical method of Gilbert's history of American poetry. Since the sexual difference is the only difference that makes a dif- ference for Gilbert, she can move directly to the literary level, to Whitman and Dickinson as writers, sans all mediation. There she finds that genre directly expresses one of the genders and directly suppresses the other. Whitman, for all his originality, had to "fortify" his threatened masculinity through covert allusions to the major ("essentially male") genres of English poetry; Dickinson, because she is a woman, cannot do that. Hence it is she who is authentically alienated, she the authentic American original, the true fulfillment of the Emersonian dream of a radically American literature, the mother of all authentically original American poetry in the twentieth century. Since her "not poetry" constitutes a rejection of all poetic forms hitherto known to men, it is her poetry, not his, that is truly innovative (Whitman only seems more original than he is) because her verse moves toward what Gilbert calls the "undifferentiation of prose" which is "implicitly maternal," literary feminism's version of Freud's oceanic feeling and the female alternative to the clean, tidy, uptight, and well- controlled world of male poetic genres. The point is deliciously confirmed for Gilbert when Whitman, in apparent reversal of an earlier position in which he defines the male genitals as the authentic poems ("This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry, and all men carry") late in his career says that the true poem is a vagina: "Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded. ... Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of women can come the poems of men"-"Unfolded" and "duly obedient" (this last phrase of Whitman's Gilbert italicizes without a trace of humor). No male poet, including Whitman, can live with the truth, Gilbert believes, the priority and authority of the female. Male modernist poets following in the footsteps of Walt Whitman quickly repress the thought; female poets, following Dickinson, reject all poetic tradition, therefore all male authority: they are the real avant-garde of modernism. And Stevens is no exception to the rule: his poems are not formally innovative-they are rather spineless reshufflings of traditional poetic genres which are intended to "fortify" his "imperilled" ego.22 By everywhere 22. Ibid., pp. 130-31, 140, 142, 144-45, 152. See also M, p. 67: "Most Western literary genres are, after all, essentially male."</page><page sequence="44">Critical Inquiry Summer 1987 785 reversing the usual macho cliches, Gilbert's rhetoric invents the new cliches of macha. It is Dickinson who can face the music and dance- she requires none of the varnishing illusions supplied by genre. Dickinson, therefore, not Whitman or Stevens, has real balls. In the end Gilbert's economic metaphors of culture are forced into a seriousness which her kind of feminism (a new name for essentialist humanism) seems never to have intended for them; these metaphors are haunted by their own countereffects which undo her argument by revealing its inability to successfully suppress history, real economic determinants, and the fully socialized sexual identity. She writes that the "treasures" of Western culture are the "patrimony of male writers," a "grand ancestral property that educated men had inherited from their intellectual fore- fathers," and that the literary female relatives of those men were necessarily relegated to "modest dower houses on the edge of the estate." And let us note again that Gilbert's sexual-economic allegory of culture is confined by another metaphor-that of the aristocratic family: this sexual struggle for power is all in the wealthy family. If that is so, however, then how can it be the case that the distinction between male and female writers (as she insists in the next sentence) is one between "male patrimony" and "female penury?" A dower house of English literature, after all, or even an actual dower house are not conditions of penuriousness by any standard, especially not so within the English aristocratic model that shapes her argument. What Gilbert's argument must ignore are those experiences of English writers (male and female) who never even get close to dower houses, in real or literary estate, and whose literary and other property was never ancestral because they inherited nothing. But Gilbert must do more than ignore those experiences: she must appropriate real economic penuriousness as metaphor for the spiritual sort that char- acterizes the situation of the aristocratic woman of literary aspiration in the nineteenth century (penuriousness of the leisured class). This argument becomes bizarrely inappropriate when it is imposed on American literature, and she so imposes it when she turns her attention to Stevens, whose "A Postcard from the Volcano" she finds attractive because it employs what looks like the same metaphor of the ancestral mansion. Stevens' poem would appear to clinch her argument in its modernist American extension. Gilbert describes the tone of this poem as "wistful"; it is, but she has no persuasive account of a context for that tone. For her it is just there as a kind of oddly sad note in the generally confident and free-floating phallic music of literary patriarchy (see "FC," pp. 33-34). Stevens is meditating on not having heirs, or on not having heirs who can acknowledge him as the patriarch, or on not being able to pass on his patrimony and in the same act transmit his authority and create himself as the patriarch; all of the above. Strange new patriarch, who bequeaths not an anxiety of influence to his children (who he imagines will not recognize him as their father) but an anxiety of influencing to</page><page sequence="45">786 Frank Lentricchia Wallace Stevens himself, as he imagines his nonsurvival as a writer, imagines his inability to become canonical, part of the tradition; imagines his failure to become one of "your man-poets." What shall we say of this male's relation to his patrimony? What is patrimony, anyway, that cannot be bequeathed to one's children as it was bequeathed to oneself? Probably patrimony that never was bequeathed, patrimony, then, that never was patrimony. Gilbert's feminist categories break down, at this point, because they cannot attend to the American circumstances of this poem's production: in the context of the early 1930s when Stevens bought his first home, gracious in space, but no mansion; in the context of this middle-class life in which he inherited no real estate from his father; in the context of a life, in other words, whose only mansions were metaphorical. And even those were radically in doubt: in the early thirties Stevens, then past fifty years of age, could look back at his first and only volume of poems, published in 1923, at age forty-four, and contemplate the almost nothing written or published in between. And he could look forward and imagine himself childless: not "my children" but Children picking up our bones Will never know that these were once As quick as foxes on the hill ... He could look forward and imagine himself unacknowledged by a gen- eration of writers who feel no burden of history; his golden style repeated in blithe ignorance and ease: Children, Still weaving budded aureoles, Will speak our speech and never know ... Patriarchy? Patrimony? Grand ancestral property? Dower houses? It would be hard to think of terms less appropriate to the description of Stevens or any number of other modern writers in the United States. Gilbert and Gubar's essentialist humanism is in fact compromised by the conditions of canonical literary production in nineteenth-century England; these conditions are now, in Gilbert's recent work, being projected as the con- ditions of American writing. "A Postcard from the Volcano," published in 1936, is produced by a double career, driven by a double desire for literary and economic substance and staying power-that, I believe, is where its wistfulness comes from. This doubleness of desire is generally the circumstance of Stevens' writing, but circumstance only; not explanation. "A Postcard from the Volcano" is a modern American male instance, not harsher, or bleaker, than the instances of Emily Dickinson, but different.</page></plain_text>
