<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews are the author's opinions on Hindemith and on contemporary American compos- ers. Indeed, in his summation, he states that "On the basis of the evidence pre- sented here, it would seem that the ma- jority of good music for solo piano written in the 1970s and 1980s, and the most var- ied stylistic selection as well, comes from composers living in this country" (p. 257). Burge's final plea is that serious pianists need to make known to their audiences this wonderful body of literature.

ISBN 0-295-96948-2. $19.95.] Organology is a classic category of mu- sicological analysis, but it is also a curiously deceptive one. Meaningfully, the category is a metonym for the diverse qualities of musical sound itself: musical instruments may be conceived of as "objects," but their essential value emerges from the sounds they produce. The term further begs the question, from the points of view of psy- choacoustics and culture, of what consti- tutes the "musical." The familiar instru- mental sub-grouping of "winds, strings, and percussion," for example, clearly re- flects a specific cultural bias towards the symphony orchestra as a primary musical referent. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, comparative musicologists and other inter- ested scholars, in their struggle to compre- hend an increasing amount of information concerning world musical styles, adjusted existing categorizations of musical instru- ments to better accommodate this new data. In their famous "Systematik der Musikinstrumente" (Zeitschriftfiir Ethnologie 46 [1914]: 553-90), the pioneering ethno- musicologists Curt Sachs and Erich M. von Hornbostel, adapted a four-part system of "idiophones, membranophones, chordo- phones, and aerophones" to categorize world musical instruments. Later, in his continuing efforts to grapple with the dif- ficult array of world musical types, von Hornbostel came to prefer "sound- producing instruments" over "musical in- struments" (cf. "The Ethnology of African Sound-Instruments," Africa [April 1933]: 129). Although this appears to be a more objective and inclusive category, von Horn- bostel, in accordance with the prejudices of his own cultural milieu, excluded all ref- erences to human, vocal, and corporeal sound-producing devices from his schema, as well as instruments that generated sounds without the mediation of human intent. Inevitably, the noble attempts of theo- rists such as von Hornbostel to adapt ex- isting notions of musical instruments to the realities of world music would be overcome by the radical developments in music and technology that were already well under- way. Already in 1913, in his masterpiece L'arte dei rumori (Milan: Direzione del Mo- vimento Futurista) Luigi Russolo forcefully argued for the incorporation of the rau- cous sounds of the modern city into a newly conceived "music of noise," whose instru- ments would include electric motors, print- ing presses, the trampling feet of crowds, the movements of water, air, or gas, and human and animal voices. In musique con- crete, such elements from everyday life would indeed be transformed into viable "musical instruments" or sound sources, which could be intentionally manipulated through the medium of magnetic tape. Of course, composers such as John Cage would insist that silence, unintentional sounds, and the human memory itself, are potential creators of musical stimulus. At present, computer-generated synthesis is able to both create new sounds, and to rep- licate with increasing veracity the "natural" 915</page><page sequence="2">NOTES, March 1992 sounds of acoustic instruments. Indeed, Sachs-Hornbostel and similar classification schemes, although obviously useful for lim- ited purposes, have come to seem naive in the face of "industrial rock," "guitar syn- thesizers," and "hyper-instruments" in which the physical motions involved in playing conventional instruments cause a computer to create a multiplicity of sounds. In the present era, sound is the necessary point of departure in the musicology of instruments. Unfortunately, all three of the books un- der review suffer in one way or another from their inability to recognize the obvi- ous in musical instrumentation. Margaret Kartomi's On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments fails to grasp the sound system as the proper point of departure (p. 1). And regrettably, in a book that com- plains that ethnomusicologists too readily rely "on what they learned at school as be- ing the 'objective' ways of classifying in- struments," rather than on "concepts in the cultures they study" (p. 6), the author fol- lows the tired practice of excluding the hu- man voice (as well as "sounding body move- ments") from consideration as a musical instrument (pp. xvii-xviii), even though she repeatedly refers in the text to authors or cultures (including ancient Greek, In- dian, Arabic, and medieval European) that regard it as such (cf. pp. 73, 120, 125, and 147). This and similar contradictions plague Kartomi's book, which otherwise is filled with good intentions and much informa- tion concerning a mixed assortment of terms and typologies of a possibly useful, and very local nature, strewn across forty centuries of human history. In the first part, Kartomi discusses general methodol- ogies of classification. She distinguishes be- tween taxonomies and keys, paradigms and typologies, and downward and upward classification schemes. Part 2 consists of nine case studies of classification in "soci- eties oriented toward literary transmis- sion," and part 3 consists of six case studies dealing with "societies oriented toward oral transmission." These include consider- ations of instrument classifications in, among others, China, India, Java, Tibet, Europe (from the Middle Ages to the present), West Africa, and among the Man- dailing, T'boli, and 'Are'are, based largely on information drawn from standard texts, and some original research. The folk taxonomies she enumerates are a mix of the familiar and obscure, but they generally observe quite obvious patterns. Much as in the West before the advent of computer-generated sounds, people around the world habitually classify instru- ments according to a heteroclitic combina- tion of elements. We learn for example, that Mandailing may classify their instru- ments according to their mode of sound excitation (beaten, blown, bowed, and plucked), and also according to their cul- tural origin-asli (authentic or indigenous), Muslim, and Western (pp. 215-16). In a similar way, the seventeenth-century Eu- ropean theorist Michael Praetorius classi- fied instruments as "foreign, barbarian, rustic, unfamiliar, and familiar" (p. 282). Tibetan and Greek theorists have catego- rized instruments between those that pro- duce inaudible sounds (Tibetan "mental music" and the Greek "music of the spheres") and those that produce audible sounds. Chinese music theory has inherited an ancient scheme, which categorizes in- struments according to their basic material (stone, bamboo, etc.), but which also has cosmological associations (pp. 37-42). Other possible bases of categorization in- clude an instrument's size or other details of construction, its manufacturer, its func- tion or ritual usage, its sound, foreign terms that have been borrowed, whether they are of God or the Devil, whether they are good or bad, and so on. Kartomi is to be commended for at- tempting to bring together a large mass of information. However, without the assis- tance of a computer, a thorough list of world organological terms, and a better methodological approach, we are left with a jumble, much of which is difficult to eval- uate. Footnotes, which in a scholarly book should be used to substantiate arguments in the text, are in several instances used by Kartomi to insert information that contra- dicts the argument presented in the text. The author argues, for example, that in Java, instruments of the gamelan "with a few exceptions . . . are kept quite separate in their musical style and social context from those of Muslim origin," which are in turn kept separate from those of Western origin (p. 91). In two footnotes, however (p. 916</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 291, nos. 7 and 8), several contrary ex- amples are noted, which rend this already dubious argument moot. More regrettable is Kartomi's assump- tion at the beginning, that we "have no way of knowing how established classifications originated" (p. 1). Thankfully, the author has several occasions in her text to affirm the contrary and the obvious, as in her dis- cussion of Timo Leisii's research on Finn- ish organological terminology (pp. 262- 70), that folk taxonomies are indeed able to help us in the task of reconstructing cul- tural history. Sounding forms: African musical instruments is a catalogue and collection of essays pub- lished to accompany a museum exhibition of the same title, curated by Marie-Therese Brincard, who also serves as editor of the book. In spite of its promising title, this book falls short of the sound problem al- most completely. In fact, it is really an anal- ysis of craft or handicraft sculpture, re- stricted to a very small number of musical devices of sub-Saharan Africa, essentially confined to instruments of a "traditional" nature. The concept of African musical in- struments as works of art is further nar- rowly restricted, as Brincard is primarily interested in instruments with zoomorphic or anthropomorphic forms or adornments, and, to a lesser extent, sculptures repre- senting musicians playing traditional in- struments. Unfortunately, Brincard misses the role of the human body and voice as musical instruments, and ignores the pro- liferation of electronic instruments as an aspect of African culture today, not to men- tion the marvelous group of newly in- vented instruments and those constructed of objets trouve, such as lutes with oil-can resonators. The contributors to this volume do, how- ever, offer some welcome observations. In the most substantial article in the volume, "The aesthetic dimensions of African mu- sical instruments," J. H. K. Nketia states that "a musical instrument's aesthetic value is determined by the perceived attributes of its sound ... as well as its ... visual form" (p. 24), a statement that beautifully matches the elegant title of the book. Bertil Soder- berg, in a translated version of an article published in French in 1977, describes the elaborate adornments used by some Afri- can dancers and insightfully suggests that the dancer thus "appears to himself as a decorated instrument" (p. 36). These promising ideas are regrettably not re- flected in the overall conception of the book. Most of the articles in this collection are rather brief (three to seven pages in length), and many of them are keyed to some of the more than two hundred black- and-white as well as color photographs of instruments in the catalogue. The articles generally fail to offer us a perspective on how African musical decoration compares with that in other world cultures. Chris- traud M. Geary's article concerning "slit gongs" in Cameroun, would be enriched, for example, if its purview included com- parisons to such instruments in Southeast Asia and Melanesia, where they are also the subject of extraordinary decoration, and have similar ritual associations. Other con- tributions include articles on the mbira, Akan master drums, a Nuna flute, Kongo instruments, harps, and morphology, by Cynthia Schmidt, Doran Ross, Christopher Roy, R. F. Thompson, Sue Carol DeVale, and J.-S. Laurenty. Most attractive are the photographs of the instruments them- selves. All are individually captioned, with information on size, provenance, sculptural qualities, and cultural usage or function. Making and Playing Musical Instruments is an English edition of a book originally cre- ated "in close cooperation with the Flemish folk musician Herman Dewit and the Dutch street musician Hans Goddefroy," (p. 120) and published in 1989 in the Neth- erlands. It is also a book with a very narrow focus, restricted to a mixed assortment of "folk instruments" (about fifty in all), in- cluding "primitive trumpets," "musical spoons," the tambourine, the "African lyre," and the hurdy-gurdy. The instru- ments are organized by the familiar Sachs- Hornbostel categories, and then ordered from simplest to most complex in terms of construction. The conception of musical instruments, and the cultural information provided concerning each of the instru- ments, is rudimentary, and the book actually reads as if it were written for chil- dren. There is nonetheless a charm in reading about how we would make these instru- ments. The required tools are pictured and enumerated, and the illustrations and in- 917</page><page sequence="4">NOTES, March 1992 structions for design appear to be quite adequate, although this writer has not at- tempted to build one himself. There are also a few nice photographs of folk musical instruments in use in different parts of the world. The appeal of this book, the pub- lishers would appear to believe, is for the folk music or crafts hobbyist.
