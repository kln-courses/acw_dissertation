<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO FRAGMENTS OF A SPANISH XIVth CENTURY HAGGADAH Mendel Metzger Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Strasbourg Even in the restricted field of illuminated Hebrew manuscripts some unknow codices come to light from time to time. These usually are brought out from private collections in order to be offered for sale, as it occured recently when the Bezalel National Museum - Israeli Museum at Jerusalem acquired an illuminat- ed German Haggadah of the early XVth centeruy1. However it seems far more surprising to find an unknown fragment of an illuminated Spanish Haggadah of the XIVth century in a public collection. At Modena in Autumn 1966 we were able to identify the date and origin of this fragment in the collection of the Estense Library2. This manuscript has been described very briefly in the recently published catalogue of Hebrew mss. in this library3, yet with one striking mistake, for it is said that it has an 'Italian type of script"4. But we have obviously a square Spanish writing for the text of this fragment. Bernheimer does not propose any date for it. We think that judging after its script and decoration, it belongs to the middle of the third quarter of the XIVth century. This fragment has a modern black leather book- binding' measuring 25,7 x 18 cm. The right board of the binding6 bears the following inscription in gilded letters: "MIRACOLI ACCADUTI/NELL' USCITA/ DEGLI EBREI DALL' EGITTO" on the middle of the board, and below that we read: "CODICE/DI FERDINANDO CEPPELLI/1787". The manuscript consists of fifteen leaves7 of parchment, gathered in two quires. The first quire is of seven leaves, i.e. three sheets8 and one half sheet'. This single leaf being at the end of the quire, we note that originally the miss- ing half sheet was the first leaf of this quire of eight leaves. The second quire of this fragment is complete with its eight leaves0. The dimensions of the leaves vary slightly by a few millimeters and they are between 24,5 - 24,8 x 17,5 - 17,8 cm. The layout also varies slightly and measures from 11,7 11,9 x 15,5 - 15,7 cm. The text is disposed in nine lines"; the space between these lines is be- tween these lines is between 1,9 and 2 cm (figs. 1, 2 and 4). The Modena ms. is a fragment of the text of the Haggadah'2, and it begins (fol. 1 a) with the words: be-mitsrayim ma hu omer13 "as to Egypt, what does it14 say" (fig. 4). They are part of the paragraph "Rabbi Jose, the Galilaean said" which follows the naming of the ten plagues of Egypt. At least the first half of this manuscript is missing. On the last page of the Modena fragment1', precisely on the last four lines of the text (fig. 2) we have the Psalm CXVII (Vulgate CXVI) which is one of the Psalms forming the Hallel, a prayer19 found in manuscripts of the Haggadah, whether Spanish or German, and known from the Gheniza fragments'7; but the Hallel is as well recited on most Jewish festivals18. The text of this fragment does not show any specific variant to other XIVth century Haggadoth. The instructions for the various blessings before eating the unleavened bread: matsa, and the bitter herb: maror, are on folios 11 b and 12 a. The short passage of the Shefo'h (ff.12 a - 12 b): "Oh pour out thy wrath . . " has just the sixth verse in Psalm LXXIX (Vulgate LXXVIII)19, whereas in other XIVth cent- ury Haggadoth we also find the seventh verse of the Psalm LXXIX20. Our ms. has the following kind of decoration: the initial words of paragraphs have a filigree pen-drawn of the initial words are in ink, while some initial words of paragraphs have letters of gold leaf (fig. 5)21. Finally the only decorations illustrating some passages of the Haggadah are for the paragraph on the matsa (fol. 6 b) and the maror (fol. 7 b)22 The first (fig. 5) represents a most intricate cir- cular plaited pattern showing interwoven squares and losanges, delimiting a central eight-pointed star. The interlaced strip is painted in vermillion with white dots, on a background which it divides into panels, alterna- tively blue, magenta and gold leaf. Furthermore, at the four points of the intersection of the outer circle there are decorative leaves. But such geometrical pat- terns for representing the matsa are quite often to be seen in Spanish XIVth century Haggadoth23. The plant illustrating the maror (fig. 6), is shown as a voluminous lettuce with part of its roots, and with leaves similar to those of the artichoke. This plant is painted in a dark green colour, with the outlines of the leaves traced with black ink. A lettuce of identical shape can be seen in the Haggadah of Sarajevo24, but the artist placed on either side two seated male figures holding the plant25. The Modena fragment illustrates the maror simi- larly as the Sarajevo ms. The matsa and the filigree de- coration has similarities with other Spanish Haggadoth. 25</page><page sequence="2">The second fragment of this Haggadah forms part of a codex of 205 leaves, in the University Li- brary at Bologna (Ms. 2559). It has been only men- tioned briefly in previous publications2'; but none of its miniatures have been reproduced27. This manuscript has a modern bookbinding, (ca. 1945). It measures 18 x 26 cm. The 205 leaves of parchment which constitute this manuscript contain the following miniatures and texts: the first twelve leaves2' form one quire, and they measure 17,5 x 24,7 cm. On these leaves are twelve full-page minatures, which vary slightly in their respective dimensions: fol. 3a being 12,7 x 18,3 cm, while for instance fol. 4b is 13 x 18 cm. Immedi- ately after these miniatures begin the pages with the text: a fragment of the Haggadah from fol. 7a to 15b, while from the same folio onwards and up to the last one (205b) we read a great number of liturgical poems, denominated as piyyutim, which are given various titles, as nishmat, ophan, pismon or reshut29. In the Bologna ms. we have numerous poems of this kind recited on the three festivals, called "the three feast of pilgrimage": Passover, Pentecost and the feast of Tabernacles3". The text leaves measure 17,5 x 25 cm, with some slight variations of one of two millimeters occuring be- tween one folio and another. The layout of the text measures 11,5 x 16 cm, with again some slight vari- ants of one or two millimeters occuring from one page to another. The text of the Haggadah is disposed on most pages in nine to 17 lines. This second fragment of the Haggadah text is written on one quire of eight leaves (ff. 7 a to 14 b) and on one further leaf (ff 15a and 15b) which however belongs to the following quire of our ms.3' The fragment has at its very be- ginning the first verse of Psalm CXVIII (Vulgate CXVII):" O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good . . ." (fig. 1), and is evidently the direct con- tinuation of our text of the Hallel in the Modena frag- ment, where the last line includes the final word of Psalm CXVII (fig. 2), and thus the two fragments, if put together, have the complete Hallel. After the latter prayer (fol. O1a) we have in the Bologna frag- ment the blessing said over the fourth cup of wine, and following this, comes the piyyut: pessa'h mitsrayim . . . (ff. 10b - lib) at the end of which we read the popular phrase, not yet found in all Spanish Haggadoth of the 14th century, which is recited when the seder is drawing towards its end: leshanah haba-ah birusha- layim ("Next year in Jerusalem"). Finally from folios 12a to 15b is another piyyut: mibet aven . . .These two piyyutim are part of the Haggadah according to the Spanish rite32 Although this preliminary description of the text in these fragments might, at first sight, seem super- fluous in a study of the decoration and miniatures of a manuscript, it nevertheless appeared to us here as being of necessity, since in the past scholars did not identify in the Bologna ms.3: a fragment of a Haggadah, and thus omitted to draw the attention of students of il- luminated Haggadoth to this manuscript'4. And after Sierra's article scholars were not more advanced with knowledge on this fragment, for although he noted"3: "The text begins with the second part'" of the Hallel (Psalm 117)," no one could deduce that it meant the Hallel in the Haggadah. So evidently Sierra had not identified the piyyutim which follow the Hal- lel, nor the phrase "Next year in Jerusalem" as texts which could only be part of the Haggadah. However his article did apparently awaket the curiosity of scholars. In an article published in 1956 by Mordecai Narkiss37, we note that among the various illuminated Spanish Haggadoth quoted, he only says . . . "in Bologna there is also a Haggadah." However he did not specify that it was only a fragment of a Haggadah. A few years later Cecil Roth gives this precision when mentioning the Bologna ms. in his list of Spanish Haggadoth'3: "Haggadah (incomplete) in- cluded in a prayer-book," Following this statement he refers to Sierra's article. We therefore do not know whether Roth had seen this codex himself. More re- cently this manuscript was indicated by Joseph Gut- mann'" who places it in the category of the Hagga- doth being "part of a mahzor or siddur." Gutmann gives also for sole reference the article by Sierra. None of the three specialists quoted above, have spoken of the miniatures and the decoration in this manuscript. Yet these merit a more complete de- scription than either Modona or Sierra have given. The decoration in the text of the manuscript for the initial words (ff. 7a - 205a) is entirely identical to the one, already described, in the Modena fragment. There are elaborate filigree drawings in red and purple ink around most of the initial words, written in dark ink4". Sometimes at the beginning of the main sec- tions for the various festivals41 the initial words have their letters covered with golf-leaf (fig. 1). But there are no ornamented decorations of the text as in the Modena fragment for the matsa and the maror, and this for the simple reason that we very rarely find il- lustrations or ornaments for the Hallel and the piy- yutim4'. From the point of view of Art History, the main interest for the Bologna Haggadah fragment lies in the twelve full-page miniatures at the beginning of the codex. No one has so far given a list of the scenes depicted4 . Fol. 1 a (fig. 7): Aaron's staff is changed into a serpent, and swallows up the sorcerer's serpents (Exodus VIII. 11-12). Fol. 1 b (fig. 8): first plague - water turned into blood (Exodus VII, 20-22). 26</page><page sequence="3">Fol. 2 a (fig. 9): fourth plague - wild beasts (insects according to the Vulgate) (Exodus VIII, 20). Fol. 2 b (fig. 10): fifth plague - pestilence of the cattle (Exodus IX, 6). Fol. 3 a (fig. II): second plague frogs (Exodus VIII, 2-3). Fol. 3 b (fig. 15): third plague - gnats (Exodus VIII, 13-14). Fol. 4 a (fig. 16): eighth plague - locusts (Exodus X, 13-15). Fol. 4 b (fig. 18): ninth plague - darkness (Exodus X, 22). Fol. 5 a (fig. 17): sixth plague - boils (Exodus IX, 10-11). Fol. 5 b (fig. 12): seventh plague - hail (Exodus IX, 22-25). Fol. 6 a (fig. 19): tenth plague - slaying of the firstborn (Exodus XII, 30 - 31). Fol. 6 b (fig. 21): Exodus and the pursuit (Exodus XIV, 9-20). Now regarding the order of the pages given here, and the chronology of the scenes, one notices that the latter is not always followed by the former. Obviously the sheets with the miniatures had at one time been wrongly bound44. It is the sheet with folios numbered 2 a - b and 5 a - b which should change place, and in- stead of being between the first and the third sheet of the quire, it should become the third, i. e. the inner- most sheet of the quire. Hence the actual folios would run thus: 1-3-2 / 5-4-6. The Bologna fragment had the folios of this first quire already bound in that order towards the end of the XVIIIth century, for on fol. 2 a (fig. 9) one sees on the lower margin the stamp of the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris which has been placed on this page,45 when this codex had entered it in 1796. In fact the stamp is on the recto side of the second leaf, since the first one had been damaged and had therefore only part of the lower margin intact. This damaged first leaf was restored when the manu- script was rebound some two decades ago (cf. figs. 7-8). Both the Modena and the Bologna fragments bear inscriptions which make it evident that they were once in the hands of one and the same owner. On the lower margin of fol. 7 a of the Bologna ms. (fig. 1) one reads: "Ferdinandi Ceppelli / Mutinend ("from Modena") 1757." We saw earlier that the same name is on the modern binding of the Modena fragment4" Ceppelli had acquired the Bologna fragment at the latest by 1759, while the Modena fragment have been in his hands already by that year, or might have come into his possession later. It was Ceppelli himself, as can be inferred by comparison of the writing on this fragment and his catalogue of his collection (cf. figs. 1, 3, 4 and 7), who wrote the following inscription on fol. I a of the Bologna ms. (fig. 7): "Regolamento per le Solennita Ebraiche" while on the fol. 1 a of the Modena ms. (fig. 4) he wrote: "Miracoli accaduti nell' uscita degli Ebrei dall' Egitto"47. It is most significant to note how Ceppelli had made two distinct inscriptions on the two fragments. No one seems to have made him aware that the two fragments were part of the same manuscript. Yet his inscriptions fit perfectly: the Modena fragment being part of a Haggadah, deals in fact essentially with the Exodus, while the Bologna ms. to those who did not notice that it had also the final part of a Haggadah, was in fact to be interpreted as "Jewish festivals." Doubtlessly a Hebrew scholar gave him the necessary indications as to the contents of the two fragments, but missed the Haggadah text in the Bologna fragment. Ceppelli was evidently curious about Hebrew mss. for he had collected about a dozen of them, and a good many manuscripts dealing with the history and religion of the Jews4 . These were part of his collec- tion of almost six hundred manuscripts known to us by the unpublished catalogue49 by Ceppelli begun on the 9th day June 1779, Ceppelli died in January 178750 and we know that his collection was dispersed. Only 137 mss. went to his inheritors. No doubt it was at that moment that one of them wrote: "Codice di Ferdinando Ceppelli 1787" on some paper he attached to the manuscript. Hence the bookbinding made after 1905, when one of the later descendents5' bequeathed all the manuscripts from this heritage to the Estense Library, bears this inscription on its front cover. The bookbinder fortunately copied it before destroying the paper on which this indication had been noted. The Modena fragment figures in Ceppelli's cata- logue under item No. 4, and Ceppelli repeated there what he had noted on the first page of the fragment concerning its context, and he only added some minor details'2 about the manuscript (fig. 3). But the Bo- logna fragment is not mentioned in Ceppelli's cata- logue. Surely he had not forgotten to inscribe it there. We can only explain its absence by the fact that he had disposed of it before 1779. For we know that in 1772 he had offered to the Estense Library two Hebrew mss. from his collection: a scroll of the Law, and a scroll of Esther53. Of the five Hebrew mss. in- scribed as the first items in his catalogue, he crossed out three 4, leaving item No. 4, our fragment of the Haggadah (fig. 3), and item No. 2, a, scroll of Esther5". So he had a second scroll of Esther in his collection, since he had already given one to the Es- tense Library some years earlier. We suppose that he gave the three items, crossed out in his catalogue, to some other library or collector. Similarly he may have donated the Bologna frag- ment. There are no records when the manuscript enter- ed Bologna University Library. It certainly came there from one of the nearby convent libraries, for these 27</page><page sequence="4">collections were brought to the University Library in 1866, when religious corporations had been suppressed in Italy. From the convent of San Salvatore, twelve Hebrew mss. were transferred to the University"6, and it seems likely that this fragment came from there57. It is known that the illuminated Hebrew Avicenna (ms. 2197) came to Bologna University from the convent of San Domenico"8. Having analysed the two fragments as to their con- tents, and shown that they had both passed through the hands of Ceppelli who again dispersed them, we now want to discuss the style and the iconography of the full-page miniatures in the Bologna fragment. We have noted that the decoration in the Modena fragment has a close similitude with the Sarajevo Haggadah. This be- comes strikingly evident when we compare the minia- tures of these two manuscripts. In fact their style is almost identical. In his list of mediaeval illuminated Haggadoth, Gutmann59 has established a column en- titled "Related Haggadah Mss." But neither for the Sarajevo ms. nor for the Bologna ms. does he men- tion any other manuscript for comparison, we there- fore must conclude that he considers them both as unique specimens amongst illuminated Haggadoth. Fur- thermore, Roth mentions the Bologna fragment in two publications. The first time he writes60: "The other category, represented by the Kaufmann Haggadah, the Rylands Haggadah, B.M. MS. Or. 1404 the Parma and Bologna Mss. and B.M. MS. Or. 2737," while in the second publication6' he repeats the same list of manuscripts, only changing their respective order. From the point of view of style these manuscripts have nothing in common with each other, and Roth groups them solely for their cycle of Exodus illustrations. Yet he missed the common points between the Bologna and Sarajevo mss. Modona was the first to attribute these miniatures in the Bologna codex to the XIVth century62, and by doing so he showed that he had a good judgement on style. Sierra practically repeats Modena's indications about the date of the manuscripts63. Gutmann assigns it to the second half of the XIVth century24. We place this manuscript roughly into the middle or the third quarter of the same century. Likeness in the styles of the Bologna and Sarajevo miniatures lies in the drawing of the human figures: they all have almond shaped eyes, with prominent dark iris; their bodies are elongated and rather thin, they point with their index finger, they all wear the same type of garments: long gowns with short hooded capes, and in several cases have double bands hanging on the chest. In both manuscripts the miniatures are within a rectangular frame; but in the Sarajevo Hagga- dah all full-page miniatures are divided into two regis- ters, while the Bologna fragment has only one double register, on fol. 6 a (fig. 19). Furthermore, striking similarities can be noted in the disposition of the figures and other objects in the two manuscripts. Moses and Aaron are always stand- ing to the right of the scene, while Pharao is to the left, seated on a throne which in both manuscripts has almost the same form (cf. figs 7 - 22); in some of the miniatures Pharao's counselors are depicted, and they are always standing near him (fig. 7, 8, 11 and 15). Yet there are other details showing the analogies be- tween the Bologna and Sarajevo miniatures. For the second plague we have an identical furnace into whose opening frogs have jumped (fig. 11 and 13), and frogs are filling water basins of the same type"5. For the plague of hail we see in both manuscripts (fig. 12 and 14) trees of identical shapes being bent downwards by the hail striking their upper branches, while shep- herds with their flock vainly seek shelter beneath them66. For the ninth plague, we see in the Haggadah of Sarajevo (fig. 20), three Jews in an aedicula (to the left of Pharao) seated at a table. One of them is hold- ing an open book. This shows that the Jews did not suffer from this plague, for they had light in their habitations. But the Egyptians, also in an aedicula to the right of Pharao, are plunged in darkness67, In the Bologna miniature (fig. 18) the disposition of the two groups is more logical: Pharao is grouped together with the Egyptians to the left, where there is darkness, while the Jews (here playing musical instruments, are to the right, where there is light, and where Moses and Aaron are standing. We also find a remarkable simili- tude of the aediculae. For the death of the firstborn, there are many differences in the two miniatures: in Sarajevo (fig. 20) the scene is placed vertically to the right68, while in the Bologna ms. (fig. 19) it is dis- posed horizontally. In the latter there are mourners next to the dead, and none in the Sarajevo miniature. But the scenes of Pharao waking Moses and Aaron are identical. If we leave aside the counselors standing next to Pharao in the Bologna miniature, we are left with the same type of building with a tiled roof, and Moses and Aaron looking out of windows; as in the Sarajevo miniature, where however each figure is looking out of a different window. Above them can be seen a loggia with a third figure, while in the Bologna miniature there is only one large window above the door, and no loggia. Finally the scene depicting the Jews leaving Egypt is represented on two registers69 in the Sarajevo ms. (fig. 22), and in the Bologna ms. as one full-page scene (fig. 21). The moment when "the children of Israel went out with a high hand"70 is more clearly depicted in the upper register of the Haggadah of Sara- jevo, where there are a good number of figures raising their hands, while in the Bologna ms. only two persons are making the same gestures. However the episode of Moses opening the red-sea is not shown in the Bologna miniature. We further find in both miniatures an identical building, a tower, behind the rear of the Israelites and the advancing army led by Pharao. Such 28</page><page sequence="5">details cannot be found in any other illuminated Span- ish Haggadah. And besides the Bologna ms. there ex- ists no other Haggadah with miniatures comparable to the Sarajevo ms.71. There are however noticeable differences in the iconographic elements of the miniatures examined here. In our opinion the Bologna ms. is closer to the Biblical text in its iconography than the Sarajevo ms. As the first example let us quote the representation of the magicians: In the Bologna codex the following scenes are depicted: (a) Aaron's staff changed into a serpent (fig. 7); (b) the first plague (fig. 8); (c) the second plague (fig. 11); (d) the third-plague (fig. 15). For the three first plagues and for Aaron's staff-serpent the text of Exodus states that the magicians were present at the performance of the miracles. This iconography had been taken into full account by the artist. But in the Sarajevo codex we do not find such a scrupulous close- ness to the text. Thus although for the first two scenes (a and b) we see also the magicians in the Sarajevo Haggadah, we do not have them in the following minia- tures where they ought to be represented as well: fol. 22 a lower register (fig. 13) and fol. 23 b upper regis- ter. In the third plague we see in both manuscripts representations of Egyptians who are suffering from the gnats, while only in the Bologna ms. three magi- cians stand next to Pharao (fig. 15). On the other hand, we see in the two manuscripts for the sixth plague, several Egyptians suffering from boils. In nei- ther example, do these represent the magicians for they do not wear the particular garments we see in the two manuscripts72. Another scene where the artist of the Bologna ms. has carefully interpreted the text, is the ninth plague (fig. 18) where Moses is seen stretching forth his arm towards heaven (Exodus X, 22). In the Sarajevo ms. (fig. 20) Moses is holding the staff in one hand and stretching out his second hand. Accord- ing to the text, the staff was not to be represented in this scene. Finally we see the column of the cloud which, according to the text of the Bible (Exodus XIV, 19-20) stood behind the Israelites and thus separated them from the Egyptians, faithfully depicted in the Bologna ms. (fig. 21), while it is missing in the Sara- jevo ms. Another detail is the depiction of the water changing into blood for the first plague enclosed in a rectangular frame in both manuscripts, with only a slight variant: in the Bologna Haggadah the frame is placed vertically (fig. 8), while in the Sarajevo Haggadah (fol. 22 a) it is horizontal. But in both miniatures we see identical figures of men digging the soil in order to dis- cover fresh water (Exodus VII, 24). There are other details worth mentioning: the miniatures have inscriptions of Biblical quotations to explain the scenes. In the Sarajevo ms. they are in square Hebrew writing above and below each minia- ture, and in the Bologna ms. these are in cursive writ- ing, on the background of the miniatures above and next to the main figures. As for the drawing, it is at first sight very similar in both manuscripts, but the Bologna miniatures show more vigour and freedom of line, have a great deal of elegance in the figures, whereas the Sarajevo Haggadah is rather rough, the figures are shorter and less refined in execution. We may say that the draughtsman of the Bologna miniatures was a more sensitive artist than the one who executed the Sarajevo miniatures. On the other hand, it is clear that it is not the same painter who executed the two series of miniatures, owing to the differences of the colours used, and the manner in which they been applied, The Bologna paint- er used only thin and transparent colours, and left the background uncovered. The Sarajevo painter covered the background, and used rather opaque colours. Despite the similarities we noted in the icono- graphy of the Biblical scenes, we do not think that either of the two miniature series (Bologna and Sara- jevo) could have been used for the other as a model. There are for instance some primary differences: in the Bologna codex all the scenes but two (fig. 19) occupy the full page, whereas in the Sarajevo Haggadah they are disposed in two registers. It seems unlikely that this change was introduced into one of these Mss. by using the other as a model. In fact, although it seems as easy to display a scene on a larger background, as to con- tract it into a smaller one, it occurs seldom that noth- ing would betray such a modification. In our two manu- scripts, nothing permits to conclude whether the process had been the first or the second. It seems justified to think that the models for the two manuscripts were different, but that they go back to the same archetype. We must also consider the fact that in the Bologna ms. there are only twelve miniatures illustrating scenes from Exodus, whereas in the Sarajevo ms. there are sixty-five which depict Biblical episodes from the first day of Creation to the scene showing Moses appointing Joshua before his death (Deuteronomy XXXIV, 9)73. Was there originally in the Bologna codex a Bibli- cal cycle as complete as in the Sarajevo ms.? There are no indications for this. It is very likely that a cycle of the ten plagues alone, preceded by the scene of Aaron's staff, which serves as an opening for the plague, and is followed by the depiction of the Exodus, as the consequence of the plagues, had become an in- dependent cycle in two Spanish Haggadoth, B.M. MS. Or. 1404 and Ryl. Hebrew 674. We must also ask whether originally these minatures had been intended for this manuscript, or whether they were added to the Bologna fragment by chance. The text of the Haggadah remaining in the two fragments (Modena- Bologna) is on twenty-four leaves, and we can deduce that originally the Haggadah had at least forty leaves. About sixteen leaves are therefore missing. The miniatures had been placed at the beginning of the Haggadah, and logically, if ever the Modena- 29</page><page sequence="6">Bologna fragments are to be bound together the minia- tures should be placed before the Modena fragment. We can state that these miniatures were made for this Haggadah, since we find in it a depiction of the maror (fig. 6) very similar in style to the maror in the Sara- jevo Haggadah. It can not be merely a coincidence that the miniatures with the Biblical cycle are also very close in style to those in the Sarajevo ms. Hence all the miniatures within the text and on the separate leaves were executed in the same "bottegha" where the Sara- jevo Haggadah had also been executed7". The date of the miniatures in the Modena-Bologna codex is close to that in the Sarajevo Haggadah. The latter have probably been painted during the third quarter of the XIVth century. The Modena-Bologna ms. should also be dated in this period. The style of its miniatures shows influences of Southern Italian art76, which appear in the Kingdom of Aragon where the miniatures of the Modena-Bologna Haggadah were executed. FOOTNOTES 1.

See for instance the following mss.: University College London, Mocatta library, Spanish Haggadah, fol. 43 a; British Museum, Ms. Add. 27210, fol. 44 b and MS. Or. 2737, fol. 22 a; Tuebingen, Depot der ehem. Preuss. Staatsbibliothek, Ms. Ham. 288, fol. 22 a; none of these miniatures have been reproduced so far. 24. On fol. 27 a: reproduced in: Cecil Roth, The Sarajevo Haggadah, London, 1963, fol. 27 a. (Henceforth - Roth: Sarajevo). 25. We know of one other illustration for the imaror, in B. M. MS. Or. 1404, fol. 18 a, where two standing figures support a lettuce which is of a more stylised shape than in Modena and Sarajevo. In the Spanish Haggadah re- cently acquired by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (formerly: Pollack Haggadah) we also have two men holding a plant the general shape of which is quite similar to those in the three quoted manuscripts, but it is just a sketch which has not been painted. 26. Cf. Leonello Modona, Catalogo dei codici ebraici della Biblioteca della R. Universiti di Bologna, Florence, 1889, p. 18, No. 13, and Sergio Sierra, "Hebrew Codices with Miniatures belonging to the University Library of Bologna," in The Jewish Quarterly Review, N. S., XLIIIl 1952 - 53, pp. 242-243. 27. We wish to express our thanks to Dr. Guglielmo Man- fre, Director of the Biblioteca Universitaria, for having permitted us to photography the pages in this codex. 28. Ff. 1- 12. 29. For an explanation of Jewish prayers see for instance: l.eopold Zunz, Die synagogale Poesie des Mittelalters, Berlin, 1855. 30. So far no details about the contents of this ms. have been given. Modona, loc. cit. describes it merely thus: Ma'hzor. Antico formulario di Salmodie e Cantici o Inni Sacri, da recitarsi nello quattro principali solennita ed altre ricorrenze festive e l'ordine da seguirsi in ciascuna di esse." We must point out that Modona speaks of the "four main festivals"; we think that he counted perhaps the celebration of the three last days of the feast of Tabernacles as a separate festival. However generally no distinction is made, and the whole period of eight (or nine) days bears the name of the feast of Tabernacles. It seems also likely that Modona did not examine the contents of the pivyutitm and thought they were for all the festivals of the year "altre ricorrenze festive," i.e.: Rosh Hashana (New Year) and Yomr Kippur (Day of Atonement). On the other hand Sierra (op. cit., p. 242) just repeats a shortened version of Modona's above description: "It is an ancient prayer formulary or "Ma- hazor," containing the tefilloth to be recited on the main Jewish festivals." Hence we think it useful to give at least an outline of the main contents in this ms.: the prayers for the eight days of Passover (ff. 15 b - 55 a); the prayers for the two days of Pentecoste (from fol. 55b onwards); the prayers for the feast of Tabernacles (fol. 112 a ff.): instructions relative to the Succa, the tabernacle, (fol. 137 b ff.); prayers for Hoshana Rabba (ff. 175 a to 205 a). Our codex (Modena-Bologna) with the text of the Haggadah followed by a great many hymns for Jewish festivals, does not constitute an exception amongst il- luminated Spanish Hebrew mss. of the XIVth century. There are several of such manuscripts. For instance the Ms. Ham. 288 at Tuebingen has after the Haggadah (ff. 2 b - 40 b) Biblical texts (from fol. 41 a onwards) and prayers for Hoslana Rabba and the last days of the feast of Tabernacles (from fol. 77 a onwards). Also the B.M. MS. Add. 14761 has after the Haggadah (ff. 17 b - 84 b) poetical synagogal pieces for the Passover Services, and Biblical readings for Passover. On the other hand, there are several Spanish mss. of this period which have the Haggadah and a great num- ber of piyyutim for Passover ,but none of the other festival prayers. There are for instance: the Sarajevo Haggadah, wherein the text of the Haggadah is on ff. 1 a - 50 a, while the liturgical poems are from ff. 53 b - 81 a (cf. Mueller-Schlosser: Sarajevo, pp. 46-92) the MS. Ryl. Hebrew at the John Rylands Library and the MSS. Or. 1404 and Add. 27210 at the British Museum (cf. Meir Wallenstein, "Hebrew MS. 6 in the John Ry- 30</page><page sequence="7">lands Library. with special reference to two hitherto unknown poems by Yehudah (Halevi ?)," in Bullletin of the Johli Rylands Library, XLI1I. 1960-61, pp. 243 ff. Finally we mention a manuscript with only the text of the Haggadah and none of the piyyutimt for Passover or other festivals, for it seems that such manuscripts have been rare: it is the "Kaufmann Haggadah" (Ms. 422) at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences at Budapest. For this ms. see the facsimile edition by Alexander Scheiber, The Kaufmann Haggadah, Budapest. 1957. 31. It is a complete quire, yet it has only six leaves (ff. 15 - 20). And again from the third quire onwards, they all are of eight leaves. But the fol. 205 is an isolated half- sheet. 32. However there are some illuminated Spanish Haggadoth of the XIVth century where both piyyutim are missing: these are: The Kaufmann Haggadah and the two B.M. MSS. Or. 1404 and Add. 27210. Then we have manu- scripts where only the first mentioned piyyut, pessa'l mitsravim, figures: for instance in the two B.M. MSS. Or. 2884 (ff. 64 a - b) and Add. 14761 (ff. 85 a - 87 a), and in the Spanish Haggadah at the Mocatta Library, fol. 54 a. But the following mss. have the two pivyutim. B.M. MS. Or 2737 (ff. 32 a - 35 a), MS, Ryl. Hebrew (ff. 2 a - 4 b), Sarajevo Haggadah (ff. 40 a - 46 b), Letchworth, Sassoon Ms. 514 (ff. 77 a - 79 a), Rome, Biblioteca Casanatense, Ms. ebr. 2761 (ff. 52 b - 55 b), Tuebingen, Ms. Ham. 288 (ff. 76 a - 77 a), Parma, Biblioteca Palatina, Ms. Parma 2411 - De Rossi 1107 (ff. 40 b - 42 b), Ms. Parma 2229 - De Rossi 1017 (ff. 42 b - 50 b), Ms. Parma 697 (ff. 17 a - 18 b). It should be noted, that there are still a good number of Spanish mss. of the XIVth century, which we have not mention- ed here. We must point out that in our opinion none of the extant illuminuated Spanish Haggadoth can be as- cribed to the Xlllth century. The oldest ones are of the early XlVth century. On the other hand, we find both piyyutim in Hagga- doth for use in the South of France, where the rite was very close to the Spanish rite. Those we mention are all of the XIVth century, and contain only decorations. but no scenes with human figures. They are at the Biblioth6que Nationale (Paris): mss. hebr. 636 (ff. 119 a - 121 b), hibr 637 (ff. 137 b - 139 b) and h6br. 654 (ff. 36 b - 38 b). Furthermore, David Kaufmann in his article "Une Haggada de la France septentrionale," in Revue des etudes juil.es, XXV. 1892, pp. 65 - 77, has analysed the text of a XIVth century Haggadah with illustrations (Haggadah, collection Wolf), which he thinks has been entirely written in the North of France, and has the two piyyutim. Unfortunately this manuscript disappeared around 1930-1935 (at that time it was in the collection of the Jewish Community of Berlin). Kaufmann did not seem to realize that these piyyutim were only in Haggadoth of the Spanish rite. We have never come across any mention of Haggadoth which followed the rite of the North of France (or Germany or Italy) and has as well one or both of these piyyutim. We tend to believe that these pivyutim had been added to the Hag- gadah Wolf at a later period, when the nis. was in the possession of Rabbi Jacob ben Salomon who lived in Avignon in 1373 (Kaufmann, loc. cit.). For a description of the illustrations in this Haggadah, cf. Mueller - Sch- losser: Sarajeivo, pp. 112 - 113. 33. See above, n. 30. 34. Neither Kaufmann, nor Mueller - Schlosser or Italiener, and not even Munkacsi who had been in Bologna, as he describes and reproduces details of the illuminated Hebrew Avicenna codex - Ms. 2197 at the University Library, in his book (in Hungarian) Miniature Art in Italian Libraries, Hebrew Codices. Budapest, 1937, have ever seen or heard of it. 35. Op. cit., p. 243. 36. We add: what is usually called the "second part of the Hallel" is the part read in the Haggadah after the meal and just following the shefo'h, and which comprises the Psalms 115-118. 37. "A Spanish Passover Haggadah from about 1300" (in Hebrew), in Ha-arets. 1956 (March 26). 38. "The John Rylands Haggadah." in Bulletin of the Jo/ln Rvlands Library, XLIII 1960 - 61, p. 137, No. 8 of his list. 39. Cf. his article "The Illuminated Medieval Passover Hag- gadah: Investigations and Research Problems," in Studies in Bibliography (and Booklore, VII, 1965. No. 12 40. Sierra writes (op. cit., p. 243): "each of its letters are enclosed in a strange design and flourish," and he did not seem to have seen such filigree design in other manu- scripts. Yet it is most common in Spanish Hebrew manu- scripts of that period, and many of the Haggadoth have it on some pages of the text. See for instance: the Hagga- dah of Sarajevo, passim, the Elkan Nathan Adler Hagga- dah (No. 1337 v) in the library of the Jewish Theologi- cal Seminary of America, the Tuebingen Ms. Or. 569, Parma De Rossi 1017 and De Rossi 1107, Ryl. Hebrew MS. 6, and many others. 41. For instance, ff. 7 a, 15 b, 35 b, 51 a, etc. 42. We know of two exceptions: in the Sarajevo Haggadah we have ornamental decorations to the Hallel: fol. 46 b (with two human figures) and fol. 49 b (with two figures added in the XVth century); cf. Roth - Sarajevo; in the Ms. 514, collection Sassoon, Letchworth, from ff. 65 - 75 are numerous representations of human figures, and ornamental decorations. 43. Modona, loc. cit., describes these scenes thus: "le dieci piaghe dalle quali furono percossi l'Egitto ed il suo re al tempo dell' Esodo; la verga di Mose che si tramuta in serpe ed il passagio del mar Rosso," while Sierra, loc. cit. virtually repeats in English, only with some slight differences, Modona's text. 44. The Kaufmann Haggadah has also its sheets with the miniatures wrongly bound; cf. Mueller - Schlosser: Sara- jevo, p. 187, n. 1, where the fact is mentioned but with- out any detail. We were able to examine this ms. at Budapest, and we could notice that exactly as in the Sarajevo Haggadah the miniatures have been painted on one side only of each leaf, in such a manner that the miniatures always face each other. This has not been specified neither by Mueller-Schlosser nor by Scheiber (op. cit.) who give a list of the miniatures, and this can not be seen in the facsimile edition where the blank pages have not been reproduced, so that it seems that the miniatures have been painted on either side of each leaf, and thus it appears most unlikely that it is due to an error of binding that there is no chronological order of the scenes. We have therefore reestablished the original order, instead of the actual wrong one: a) five sheets with ten full-page miniatures have been bound at the begin- ning of the codex, and two sheets with four full-page miniatures are bound at the end of the codex; b) all the sheets have been folded, so that the miniatures on the sheets face each other, and the folded sheets have been separately bound, one next to the other. Originally there were qiires, of which remains one isolated sheet, and two quires, each of six leaves. The actual order of the leaves bearing the miniatures is the following: I b - 2 a, 3 b - 4 a, 5 b - 6 a, 7 b - 8 a, 9 b - 10 a, 101 b - 102 a, 103 b - 104 a, while the new order to be established is: ff. 10 a - 9 b being an isolated sheet, followed by: ff. 103 b, 6 a, 7 b, 8 a, 5 b, 104 a = one quire, and ff. 1 b, 4 a, 101 b, 102 a, 3 b, 2 a - the second quire. 45. Another such stamp is on the last folio (205 a) of the manuscript, below the last line of the text. 46. See also below. 47. The same words have been repeated on the modern book- binding. 48. Ceppelli was not the only Christian in Modena who col- lected Hebrew mss. For instance Graziano, who lived during the first half of the XVIIth century had acquired a Spanish Haggadah. now at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Ms. ENA 1337 v. 49. This manuscript is at Modena, Biblioteca Estense, Ms. H. 2. 1. It had been formerly in the collection of Cam- pori who had bequeathed the whole of it to the Estense Library, in the second half of the XIXth century. Cf. L. l odi, Cataloeo dei Codici e degli Autografi posseduti dal Marcliese Giuseppe Campori, Modena, 1875, p. 379, No. 988. 50.

These are: No. 1: Pentateuch; No. 3: Book of Psalms with interlinear Latin translation; No. 5: Pentateuch with targium and Rashi. 55. Ceppelli had first described this manuscript as being a "Libro della storia di Ester" and he crossed this out, and corrected it as a "Volume della storia di Ester." 56. Cf. Domenico Fava, Tesori delle Biblioteche d'ltalia, Emilia e Romagna, Milan, 1932, p. 3. 57. During our short stay at Bologna we could not advance our researches far enough to reach conclusions about the provenance of this manuscript; at first sight the few documents put at our disposal, seemed to indicate that the fragment came to Bologna from San Salvatore. Yet we would have to go through the archives at Paris, to find out whether the arrival of this manuscript at the Bibliotheque Nationale in 1796 had been noted, as being with the lot of 506 mss. taken by the French from the convent of San Salvatore, or whether in 1815 when the mss. were sent back to Italy, this fragment was on the list of the mss. returned to Bologna. Obviously, the actual shelf-mark Ms. 2559, was given to this fragment after it had entered the University Library in 1866. 58. Cf. Fava, op. cit., p. 9. 59. Op. cit. 60. Op. cit. in Bull. J. R. L., p. 143. 61. Cf. Roth: Sarajevo, p. 16 where we find a printer's error: namely "1737" instead of 2737 for the B.M. MS. Or. he gave as above. 62. Loc. cit.: "Il Codice non ha alcuna iscrizione che ne riveli con certezza l'eta; ma le figure delineate nei disegni cui sopra si i accennato vestite tutte alla foggia del XIV secolo, fanno ritenere molto verosimilmente che debba appartenere alla stessa epoca." 63. Loc. cit.: "As the shapes of the garments of the figures drawn on the manuscript belong indeed to the 14th century, it is likely that the manuscript which is without any indication or inscription as to the time of its com- position, originated at the 14th century." 64. Cf. his list, loc. cit. Roth, loc. cit., does not propose any date for it. 65. Haggadah of Sarajevo, fol. 22 a; this figure, and the following ones: 14, 20 and 22 reproduced here, are made after Mueller - Schlosser: Sarajevo, loc. cit. 66. Haggadah of Sarajevo, fol. 25 b. 67. Haggadah of Sarajevo, fol. 26 a upper register. 68. Haggadah of Sarajevo, fol. 27 b. 70. Exodus XIV, 8. 71. Cf. Roth Sarajevo, p. 40, where he says: "The miniature however, not withstanding the anti-anthropomorphic tendency of the manuscript as a whole, illustrates this by showing the divine hand emerging from the clouds (this being the case also in the allied and apparently derivative British Museum manuscript, Or. 2737)" In our opinion the two miniatures can not be compared since in the Or. 2737 we see an arm and the wing of the angel, while in the Sarajevo miniature there is only his arm. And numerous other examples of the sacrifice of Isaac in Jewish miniatures could be cited, whether with an arm only, or with part of the figure of an angel. Finally there are no stylistic nor iconographic analogies between the miniatures in Or. 2737 and those in the Sarajevo Haggadah. But when Roth draws the conclusion that the first named one derived from the second one, he made an error of judgement: the Or. 2737 was cer- tainly executed before the middle of the XIVth century, while the Sarajevo Haggadah is of the third quarter of the century. 72. Roth: Sarajevo, p. 29 thinks however that these are the magicians. 73. Following the Biblical cycle are three more miniatures: the Messianic Temple, the distribution of the 'harosset and the nmatsot and Jews leaving the synagogue (ff. 32 a, 33 b and 34 a). 74. There are five additional scenes in these two Haggadoth: Moses with Jethro's flock, Moses before the burning bush, the drowning of the Egyptians, and the Jews passing through the sea, the killing and roasting of the lamb and two families celebrating the Seder 75. Mueller-Schlosser: Sarajevo, p. 30, think that this manu- script was executed towards the end of the Xllth century or the beginning of the XIVth century. A. Goldschmidt in his book review on the Sarajevo publication in Re- pertoriumn fuer Kunstwissenschaft, 1900, p. 334 did not agree with Mueller-Schlosser, and decided rightly that the Haggadah was of a "well advanced period within the XIVth century" ("Sie gehoert . . .dem vorgeschrit- tenen XIV."). Helen Rosenau "Notes on the Illumina- tions of the Spanish Haggadah in the John Rylands Li- rary," in Bulletin of the Jolhn Rylands Library, XXXVI, 1953-54, p. 478, puts the question whether the Haggadah "should be assigned to the beginning or the middle" of the XIVth century, and concludes "the latter period ap- pears more likely." And Roth: Sarajevo, p. 26, places the Haggadah in the second half of the XIVth century. 76. See for instance at the Biblioteca Riccardiana (Florence) the Ms. Rice. 881 of the XIVth century, executed in the South of Italy, probably in Sicily. 3 Modena, Estense Libr., detail Cepelli. 1 Bologna, Univ.
