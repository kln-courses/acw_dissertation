<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 370   12 The embodied poetics of a  nineteenth-c entury heathlands  landscape Apart from Vancouver’s account discussed in Chapter 10 there is very lit-  tle historical information about the use of the Pebblebed heathlands. We  know that they were not settled. All the villages and farms occur on their  fringes. The general pattern of their use continued from the medieval  period and before. The open character of the landscape with a virtual  absence of trees was maintained by periodic swaling that would take  place during the drier summer months and by the grazing of animals,   principally cattle and sheep. Although they were owned by the Bicton  estate, Commoners from the surrounding villages had grazing rights.  Additional activities were furze cutting and digging for peat to provide  fuel. Pebbles, the only local source of stone, were quarried or collected  for building materials (see Chapter 13). The principal ‘historian’ and ‘ethnographer’ of the English low- land heathland, who provides a vivid insight into how the land was used  and its local meanings in the nineteenth century, is the novelist Thomas   Hardy (1840– 1928), who was born and brought up on the edge of the   Dorset heathlands. His knowledge of them gains full expression in The  Return of the Native ([1878] 1965). Hardy’s Egdon Heath, described in the novel, is a fictional crea- tion from his experience of at least a dozen different heathland areas  in southeast Dorset, ‘these being virtually one in character and aspect,  though their original unity, or partial unity, is now somewhat disguised  by intrusive strips and slices brought under the plough with varying  degrees of success, or planted to woodland’ (Hardy [1878] 1965: v). The  importance of the novel in relation to the present account resides both in  its historical and social realism and in Hardy’s descriptions of a lowland  370 </page> <page sequence="2"> 371 heathland landscape well known since his youth. His Egdon Heath is only  just over 80 km due east of the Pebblebed heathlands. Such is the power  of Hardy’s work that it has firmly entered, directly or indirectly, into the  contemporary social imagination, colouring our ideas of what heathland  is and why such a landscape might now be worth conserving. Natural  England, the Environment Agency, the Royal Society for the Protection  of Birds and other environmental organizations have since the late 1980s  been cooperating to restore and manage a vision of Hardy’s Dorset heath- land in their own Egdon Heath Project, in which reference to the novel  has become a publicity tool (see www.dorsetforyou.com/3 36679). In the novel Hardy describes the wildlife of the heath, traditional  heathland occupations and the deep-r ooted and enduring pagan customs  of its inhabitants. On his heathland the grazing animals were primarily  a breed of small, wild, hardy Exmoor-t ype ponies, herds of up to 30 ani- mals but too few to detract much from the solitude of the heath. These  are the ‘heath croppers’ that occur throughout the novel. Sheep and their  shepherds were only to be found on the downland to the north and west  lying off the heathland areas. Dairy herds similarly occur off the heath and  there are no grazing cattle. The wildlife of the heaths that he mentions  include night hawks, buzzards, night jars, rabbits, adders, grass snakes,  toads and frogs breeding in shallow pools that dry up during the summer,  glow worms, spiders, ants, moths, bats, rare orange butterflies, emerald  green grasshoppers and huge flies ‘ignorant of larders and wire netting’  (156, 258 and elsewhere). The vegetation consists of tall and short furze  or gorse, bracken, heather and brambles, thyme, lichens and moss. The primary heathland occupations consist of furze and turf cut- ting to provide fuel and there are numerous gravel pits. Brambles are  used for furze faggot bonds (259) and bracken for numerous purposes  including animal bedding and preserving apples (118). The heath pro- vides its fruits of whortleberries and blackberries and there are numer- ous fungi in the late summer and autumn. Furze faggots, subsequently  collected and built up into ricks, could be sold for half a crown a hun- dred (256). Furze and turf cutting are solitary, monotonous and ardu- ous occupations requiring few tools:  large heart- shaped spades for the  latter, a whetstone and a billhook for the fomer. Special protective attire  is a necessity for working in the furze, sturdy boots, thick, bulging lea- ther leggings, long gauntlets and sleeve waistcoat: ‘the silent being who  thus occupied himself seemed to be of no more account in life than an  insect. He appeared as a mere parasite of the heath, fretting its surface  in his daily labour as a moth frets a garment, entirely engrossed with its  The embodied poeTics of a heaThlands landscape 371 </page> <page sequence="3"> 372 37 products, having no knowledge of anything in the world but fern, furze,  heath, lichens and moss’ (283). Although Hardy does not romanticize his heathland characters, as  he was only too aware of the vicissitudes of rural labour, he clearly has  a passion for a landscape that in his day had already become virtually  obsolete from an economic point of view: ‘a place which had slipped out  of its century generations ago, to intrude as an uncouth object into this  [the nineteenth century]’ (181). William Cobbett, farmer and radical politician, in his famous Rural Rides  undertaken during the 1820s, consistently describes the heathlands that he  encounters as being ‘ugly’, ‘wretched’, ‘villainous’ and ‘rascally’ (e.g. Cobbett  [1830] 2001: 39). Hardy’s veiled comment on such a perspective is this: How could this be otherwise in the days of square fields, plashed  hedges, and meadows watered on a plan so regular that on a fine  day they look like silver gridirons? The farmer, in his ride, who  could smile at artificial grasses, look with solicitude at the coming  corn, and sigh with sadness at the fly-e aten turnips, bestowed upon  the distant upland of heath nothing better than a frown. (Hardy [1878] 1965: 181) What Hardy was commenting on was that until the early nineteenth cen- tury the heath had been a valued resource and was an integral part of the  rural economy. A will then developed to improve this barren and useless  land through its agricultural transformation. Hardy’s heath, as an obsolete landscape, is one in which rural tradi- tions and pagan customs endure, long forgotten elsewhere. In name the  scattered inhabitants of the heath are Christians and parishioners ‘but  they virtually belonged to no parish at all’ (128). The only time any of  the characters in the novel attend church is for wedding ceremonies that  take place off the heath. Eustacia Vye, one of the central characters in  the novel, is believed by some to be a witch. Susan Nonsuch makes an  effigy of her out of beeswax and pricks it with pins to protect her son.  Maypoles are lavishly decorated with wildflowers, the mummers play out  a traditional St George play at Christmas time. Oil extracted from freshly  killed adders is used as a cure for snake bite. Dancing takes place on Guy  Fawkes night around a fire lit on top of a prehistoric barrow, itself an  ancient rite of pagan origin (see Chapter 3). The fire takes place on top of a Bronze Age barrow situated in the  centre of the heath. Fire is also used as a messaging device for secret  lovers’ trysts taking place at the barrow. Hardy’s heath is transiently  372 landscape in The longue durée </page> <page sequence="4"> 37 occupied by the striking figure of the itinerant reddleman, his clothing  and flesh saturated with the red dye that he sells as redding for the sheep  that graze in fields beyond it. A  traditional bogeyman for children, ‘he  was one of a class rapidly becoming extinct in Wessex, filling at present in  the rural world the place which, during the last century, the dodo occu- pied in the world of animals’ (16). Hardy’s characters play out roles and  take part in customs and events which he learnt of through stories told  at his parents’ hearth at Higher Bockhampton on the edge of Piddletown  (now Puddledown) heath, much of which is presently occupied by conifer  plantations. Landscape and topographical descriptions give verisimilitude to  the novel, establishing a historical and cultural setting, grounding it ‘out  there’, and are essential to its realism and appeal: [T] he scene before the reddleman’s eyes was a gradual series of  ascents from the level of the road backward into the heart of the  heath. It embraced hillocks, pits, ridges, acclivities, one behind the  other, till all was finished by a high hill cutting against the still light  sky. The traveller’s eye hovered about these things for a time, and  finally settled upon one noteworthy object up there. It was a barrow. (Hardy [1878] 1965: 19) The narrative takes place in terms of named topographic features  and their spatial relationships, joined by paths and roads, some well worn,  others scarcely used. The novel is a figurative mapping of the heathland in  relation to which the lives of its characters are embodied. In the map that  Hardy drew for the first edition (1878), the heath is depicted as being twice  as long, west to east, as it is broad (north–s outh). A river, the ‘Shadwater  Weir’, bounds the heath to the south. The main characters live at Bloom’s  End to the west, Mistover to the north, the Quiet Woman Inn to the south  and on the eastern side on the periphery of the heath and beyond. There  are few roads across the heath, and the characters in the novel generally  walk across it to meet each other following the numerous fugitive heath- land paths: ‘those who knew it well called it a path; and while a mere visitor  would have passed it unnoticed even by day, the regular haunters of the  heath were at no loss for it at midnight .... The whole secret of following  these incipient paths [at night] lay in the development of the sense of touch  in the feet’ (63). In the novel the space of the landscape becomes charged with the  particular subjective meanings of the enacted story. This is a complex  form of metonymy in which the landscape and the characters interact  The embodied poeTics of a heaThlands landscape 373 </page> <page sequence="5"> 374 to establish a double meaning and sense of place. Each forms part of the  other in their material relations. The landscape of the novel is therefore  not a pre- existing self- sufficient entity. It is made into a landscape, into  a humanly meaningful place, by the acts of labour and dwelling that are  described and the events that take place within its contours. An import- ant role for the landscape is that it reflects the inner emotional state of  the characters. Thus it is made human, made into a landscape rather  than being a mere environment, by being both inhabited and recorded by  Hardy himself. The realism of Hardy’s novel is made possible because this was a  landscape that he himself inhabited throughout his life. Being brought  up on the edge of Puddletown heath, his embodied relationship with  that landscape is described through the medium of the characters. Clym,  the native of the heath who returns from Paris to make the heath his  home once more, had been ‘so inwoven with the heath in his boyhood  that hardly anybody could look upon it without thinking of him’ (175).  Furthermore he was permeated with its scenes, with its substance, and with its odours.  He might be said to be its product. His eyes had first opened  thereon; with its appearance all the first images of his memory  were mingled; his estimate of life had been coloured by it; his toys  had been the flint knives and arrowheads which he found there ...  his flowers, the purple bells and yellow furze; his animal kingdom,  the snakes and croppers; his society, its human haunters.  (Hardy [1878] 1965: 180) Hardy’s own mental map of the heath and the semi-fi ctional map  of it that he drew to illustrate the book are materialized in the novel.  His own individual experiences become distributed through those of the  characters that play out their lives within the heathland landscape, while  he himself stands outside these lives, orchestrating them as ‘independ- ent’ narrator. Hardy sets the novel in the period 1840–5 0, that of his own  childhood, and there is little doubt that some of the descriptions are rec- ollections of his own childhood experiences of crossing the heathland.  Its frightening aspect at dusk and in the dark is described when the boy,  Johnny Nonsuch, returns home: the gorse bushes ‘whistled gloomily, and  had a ghastly habit after dark of putting on the shapes of jumping mad- men, sprawling giants, and hideous cripples’ (80). The novel both creates  the landscape and the events that take place within it and in turn is cre- ated by that landscape. Representation and reality are thus in a perpetual  374 landscape in The longue durée </page> <page sequence="6"> 375 ‘artful’ and shifting relation in the novel and its pictorial representation  in the form of the map that Hardy made out of it. Hillis Miller puts this  well: ‘novel and map; real map and imaginary map; landscape and map.  Each is both prior to the other and later than it, causer and caused, inside  it and outside it at once’ (Hillis Miller 1995: 21). The houses of the characters in the novel are distributed around the  periphery of the heath. In the map that Hardy drew, a prehistoric bar- row, Black Barrow (in the first edition) or Rainbarrow (in later editions),  is at the centre (Figure 12.1). It is the fulcrum around which the novel  revolves. It provides an important orientation point for the characters as  they wend their way across the heath, and it articulates their actions and  movements as they move towards or away from it. Hardy describes the  barrow thus: This bossy projection of earth above its natural level occupied  the loftiest ground of the loneliest height that the heath con-  tained .... It formed the pole and axis of this heathery world.  (Hardy [1878] 1965: 19) The prehistoric barrow itself links past and present through its con- tinued pagan presence in the landscape. It has far more significance to  the lives of the heath dwellers than any church, all of which are decen-  tred off the heath. Probably the best description we have of a fire festival  (discussed in Chapter 3) is from Hardy:  It was as if these men and boys had suddenly dived into past ages  and fetched therefrom an hour and deed which had been famil- iar with this spot. The ashes of the original British pyre which  blazed from that summit lay fresh and undisturbed in the bar- row beneath their tread. The flames from funeral pyres long ago  kindled there had shone down upon the lowlands as these were   shining now. Festival fires to Thor and Woden had followed on  the same ground, and duly had their day. Indeed, it is pretty well  known that such blazes as this the heathmen were now enjoying  are rather the lineal descendants from jumbled Druidical rites and  Saxon ceremonies than the invention of popular feeling about  Gunpowder plot. Moreover to light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of  men when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded through-  out Nature. It indicates a spontaneous Promethean rebelliousness  against the fiat that this recurrent season shall bring forth foul  The embodied poeTics of a heaThlands landscape 375 </page> <page sequence="7"> 376 times, cold darkness, misery and death. Black chaos comes, and the  fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light. (Hardy [1878] 1965: 23)   Figure 12.1 Hardy’s sketch map of Egdon Heath published in the first  edition (1878) of The Return of the Native 376 landscape in The longue durée </page> <page sequence="8"> 37 The barrow is a place of death and fire rituals. It is also a place where  commemorative fires are still kindled out of furze faggots in the present,  a place for dancing, trysting and love- making. The barrow and the heath  beyond embrace and preserve the past in the present. A lack of tending  or cultivation of the heath, which Hardy notes have preserved the barrow  in the face of agrarian intensification that has taken place elsewhere, pro- vides a sense of solace in relation to a culture of unsettling and perman- ent change: ‘To know that everything around and underneath had been  from prehistoric times as unaltered as the stars overhead, gave ballast to  the mind adrift on change, and harassed by the irrepressible New. The  great inviolate place had an ancient permanence’ (14). This timeless landscape is equally indifferent to human life (329)  and the elements. Storms which ‘tore the trees merely waved the furze  and heather in a light caress. Egdon was made for such times as these’  (217). The heath has an enduring and invincible character: ‘in some of the  attempts at reclamation from the waste, tillage, after holding on for a year  or two, had receded again in despair, the ferns and furze- tufts stubbornly  reasserting themselves .... The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers,  the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained’ (14). Nearly all commentators have understood that the central char- acter in the novel is the heath itself. The heath, ‘appealing to the sen- timent rather than the eye’ (Hardy, letter to George Putnam, cited in  Cullen Brown 1990: 296), is personified as a dark, brooding creature.  The characters within the novel are the personification of this personi- fication. Neither male nor female, the heath is an androgynous body. It  gathers darkness to itself and exhales it out: ‘The face of the heath by its  mere complexion added half an hour to evening; it could in like manner  retard the dawn, sadden noon, anticipate the frowning of storms ....  The sombre stretch of rounds and hollows seemed to rise and meet the  evening gloom in pure sympathy, the heath exhaling darkness as rapidly  as the heavens precipitated it’ (11–1 2). ‘Only in summer days of high- est feather did its mood touch the level of gaiety ... Intensity was more  usually reached by way of the solemn than by way of the brilliant ...  for the storm was its lover and the wind its friend’ (13). In places the heath is likened to a nameless being, part-a nimal,  part- human, a consciousness without intentionality. Eustacia follows the  path over the autumnal entrails of the heath: ‘Skirting the pool she fol- lowed the path towards Rainbarrow, occasionally stumbling over twisted  furze roots, tufts of rushes, or oozing lumps of fleshy fungi, which at this  season lay scattered about the heath like the rotten liver and lungs of  some colossal animal’ (359). The embodied poeTics of a heaThlands landscape 377 </page> <page sequence="9"> 378 Elsewhere the heath possesses characteristics likened to social  being or humanity in a generic sense: It was at present a place perfectly accordant with man’s nature –  neither ghastly, hateful nor ugly: neither commonplace, unmean- ing, nor tame; but, like man, slighted and enduring and withal  singularly colossal and mysterious in its swarthy monotony. As  with some persons who have long lived apart, solitude seemed to  look out of its countenance. It had a lonely face, suggesting tragical  possibilities. (Hardy [1878] 1965: 13) The solitude here appears to be that of the ‘slighted’ Hardy himself and  the tragical actualities of his own life (see Gittings 1980a, 1980b for a  detailed account). The heath, like all nature for Hardy, an unconscious  thing utterly indifferent to human life, plays out its own inherent ‘tragi- cal possibilities’ through the medium of the characters’ tragic lives and  their relationships to each other that take place and are directly influ- enced by this landscape. Hardy’s character as narrator is personified in  the heath itself. His own phenomenal experiences of that landscape are  distributed through the medium of the characters and their interaction  with it. The connections Hardy made between the world of nature and the  world of his own phenomenal human bodily experience are primarily  of an anthropomorphic and metamorphic or analogic character. The  heath is a human body, it has a ‘grim old face’ and a ‘shrivelled voice’,  its own odours; its vegetation is like hair: ‘the path was an infinitely  small parting in the shaggy locks of the heath’ (159). The heathland  landscape even possesses its own audible particularity that varies from  place to place: It was possible to view by ear the features of the neighbourhood.  Acoustic pictures were returned by the darkened scenery; they  could hear where the tracts of heather began and ended; where the  furze was growing stalky and tall; where it had recently been cut; in  what direction the fir- clump lay.  (Hardy [1878] 1965: 93) Seasonality and the natural cycle become for Hardy a meditation  on human life and death: 378 landscape in The longue durée </page> <page sequence="10"> 379 The July sun shone over Egdon and fired its crimson heather to  scarlet. It was the one season of the year, and the one weather of  the season, in which the heath was gorgeous. This flowering period  represented the second or noontide division in the cycle of those  superficial changes which alone were possible here; it followed the  green or young- fern period representing the morn, and preceded  the brown period, when the heath- bells and ferns would wear the  russet tinges of evening; to be in turn displaced by the dark hue of  the winter period representing night’  (Hardy [1878] 1965: 245) The elemental forms of the sun and the moon are fundamental to  a novel that takes place in a wide and open landscape and one in which  the central characters move across the landscape by day and by night and  in accordance with sunrise and sunset. The fires on Rainbarrow emulate  the sun, the reddleman is the colour of the sun, the furze cutters faces  are browned by it, Mrs Yeobright is killed by its heat, characters retire to  bed or move toward sunrise and sunset. Solar images powerfully define  Eustacia’s changing relationship to her lovers, Wildeve and Clym, and to  Diggory, the reddleman. Relevant to humanity, the heath in its timelessness remains indif- ferent to either the sun or the moon: ‘in the course of many days and  weeks sunrise had advanced its quarters from northeast to southeast,  sunset had receded from northwest to southwest; but Egdon had hardly  heeded the change’ (113). The heath itself remains dark even in moon- light ‘powerless to silver such sable features’ (138).  Conclusions Hardy’s fiction in its historical and social realism, and through the knowl- edge gained by his own embodied personal experience, is undoubtedly  the most powerful and evocative description of a heathland landscape  ever written. Replace topographical and geological details and Hardy’s  Egdon Heath could be the East Devon Pebblebed heathlands. In spite, or perhaps precisely because of the melancholic charac- ter of Hardy’s depiction of heathland and the tragic potentialities for its  human inhabitants that are acted out in the course of the novel, heath- land has become of contemporary relevance. It has now gained value and  appeal, become something thought worth conserving. The embodied poeTics of a heaThlands landscape 379 </page> <page sequence="11"> 380 However, there is a fundamental difference between Hardy’s histori- cized, humanized and peopled landscape and the kind of heathland that  is currently being preserved under a contemporary environmental con-  servation agenda (see Chapter 14). This is a recreational heathland, for  the most part irrelevant to the daily lives of most people, who no longer  work in it. Its primary significance is now not held to reside in its history  or its prehistoric monuments, but is instead being couched in terms of a  ‘timeless’ web of ecological relations that need to be engineered or man- aged. It is these rather than its human meanings that take precedence in  contemporary discourses, and so, in this sense, such a heathland vision   conspicuously lacks a human face. 380 landscape in The longue durée </page> </plain_text>
