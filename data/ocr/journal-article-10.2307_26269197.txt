Alix Cosquer 1,2, Richard Raymond 2 and Anne-Caroline Prevot-Julliard 1,3 ABSTRACT. Public involvement is one of the keys to achieving biodiversity conservation goals. Increasing public involvement in conservation activities requires investigation into what makes people more aware of nature, especially in an ordinary and local context, in their everyday lives. Among the initiatives developed to increase the public’s awareness of conservation issues and individual environmental practices, citizen-science programs are based on an invitation to observe and survey nature. In our study, we examined the consequences of participation in a participative citizen-science program that takes place in an everyday-life context on individuals’ knowledge and beliefs about biodiversity. This program, the French Garden Butterflies Watch, is addressed to the non-scientifically literate public and is run by the French National Museum of Natural History (MNHN). We examined the ways increased knowledge or strengthened beliefs or ideas about biodiversity can foster pro- conservation attitudes and behavior. We explored how repeated interactions with nature influence the development of knowledge in this area, and how these repeated observations of biodiversity become integrated into complex cognitive processes over time and space. We showed that repeated observations of nature can increase individual knowledge and beliefs. Our results brought out three important conclusions: (1) conservation issues must be integrated into a wider network of social relationships; (2) observing everyday nature often makes people consider its functional and evolutionary characteristics; and (3) scientific knowledge seems necessary to help people to develop their own position on ecosystems.

Many experiences of nature (Clayton and Myers 2009). However, paths have already been explored to tackle biodiversity several authors have underlined the growing disconnection of decline. Early conservation approaches focused on people from nature and biodiversity (Pyle 2003).

They suggest considering all If this is indeed the case, then increasing public involvement environments, and especially anthropized environments in conservation activities requires investigation into what (Rosenzweig 2003, Prévot-Julliard et al. 2012). makes people more aware of nature (Miller 2006), especially Due in an ordinary and local context, through their everyday lives. to this growing anthropization, areas managed by people are increasing.

Public education is perceived as a necessary step for the Bonney 2009a—and developed with a lay public in mind) that implementation of individual actions toward biodiversity takes place in an everyday life context. This program is the (Hungerford and Volk 1990). However, if collected data French Garden Butterflies Watch, run by the French Museumon biodiversity are indeed used for scientific purposes (e.g., of Natural History (MNHN) and the NGO Noé-Conservation Bergerot et al. 2010a, b), the educational dimension since 2006 (http://opj.mnhn.fr/). of these observations is still largely unexplored (but see, e.g., Brossard We focused on individuals’ biodiversity knowledge and et al. 2005). Moreover, claimed education objectives concern awareness: we looked into the conditions that foster the “science education” (Cooper et al. 2007, Bonney et al. 2009a, acquisition of individual knowledge and awareness relating to b), i.e., the increase of scientific knowledge. Little is said about biodiversity. We defined knowledge more widely than the place of empirical and local knowledge of volunteers about scientific knowledge, including beliefs and ideas as well. We biodiversity and about the evolution of all these kinds of explored how repeated interactions with nature influence the knowledge during the participatory process. ways in which this knowledge is disseminated and evolves.  The development of a citizen-science project requires an We raised the following question: what influence do attentive design (Bonney et al. 2009b), which depends on the biodiversity observations fostered by citizen-science pursued objectives, i.e., scientific data gathering and public programs have on development of knowledge or beliefs about education. The different types of citizen-science programs can biodiversity? We explored this question at the individual and be analyzed through different related typologies (Danielsen et interpersonal level, at a local scale. al. 2010). The first one is the degree of public involvement— from data collecting to a collaboratively generated definition MATERIAL AND METHODS of the scientific question—(Cooper et al. 2007, Bonney et al.

The second is related to the participants’ level of In this program, garden owners are invited to identify and scientific literacy: we define the literate public as people count butterflies in their gardens to supply a national database possessing an established knowledge regarding biodiversity. Conversely, we define the non-literate (or lay) that supports scientific research. The protocol is deliberatelypublic as people very simple: observers are asked to identify and count the with no previous naturalist knowledge. A third, less butterflies they see in their gardens and to indicate, for each implemented, typology could refer to the observation context: surveys can take place in a specific, extraordinary context (that month, the maximum number of individuals of each </page> <page sequence="3"> Ecology and Society 17(4): 2 http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol17/iss4/art2/ morphospecies they have observed simultaneously. The annual sampling season runs from March to October. Fig. 1. Mapping of interviewees—France. This program has some 3,500 to 4,000 participants every year. Noé-Conservation uses various tools to run the observers’ network, some directly connected with butterfly counting (guide to identification of butterfly morphospecies, monthly count sheets), others concerning butterfly-friendly gardening (website, monthly newsletter), and an online forum where butterfly watchers can share their experiences.  Participation in the program is entirely voluntary. Observations are anonymous and contributors identified only by an email address and the location of their observation site. Participants are free to decide when and for how long they will proceed with their observations. The program encourages regular and repeated observation. Except for the butterfly identification guide and the monthly count sheets, there is no interaction between the observers and any reputedly better qualified authority. Finally, the observations take place in a private and familiar setting. All these features could potentially turn the Garden Butterflies Watch into a self- learning protocol that operates in addition to the educational content brought by the program. Indeed, if the protocol of Table 1.

Concerning the citizen-science objective ofdata collection, it appears that participants, even when they environmental values (Stedman 2002, Carrus et al. 2005). are environmentally sensitized, do not possess a deep naturalistic knowledge. Required data must then be easy to 2. Understanding the functional characteristics of nature (at watch, collect, and identify (e.g., common species or presented least in part) helps people to work out their own position at a low level of identification, e.g., at the morphospecies in relation to these dynamics. Indeed, we have shown level). This enables both large individual participation and that, whatever the motivations, observing everyday relevant scientific studies.  nature often leads people to consider its functional and evolutionary characteristics. Even if individual Regarding the other citizen-science objective of education, conditions of participation and observation offer the motivations for action can be aesthetic, ethical, utilitarian, opportunity to experience biodiversity individually andor all of these at once, people still take an interest in the living and functional features positively. Our research context underlines the existence ofof nature. Combining personal empirical observations various conditions that foster the dissemination of knowledgeand theoretical knowledge makes the newly acquired about biodiversity. Garden butterfly watching takes place in knowledge more robust (Ross et al. 2003). a familiar setting, and observers are free to choose the time and the terms of their observations. Knowledge gained through Becoming aware of this functional system could help, at participation seems to develop outside the usual specific and least partially, to re-establish people’s connections with limited framework of environmental education (classroom nature. These results confirm those of Rickinson (2001) presentations, naturalist excursions, etc.). On the contrary, the and Meinhold and Malkus (2005).

Their attentiveness to butterflies 3. Furthermore, combines with their various everyday thoughts and, withoutwe suggest that scientific knowledge about biodiversity can become part of a common reference that even thinking about it, paying attention to butterflies becomes a habit, a reflex. It is the need to count and list butterflies that can structure an episteme. Indeed, in the positions, however polymorphic, that people work out for forms this habit, makes it explicit and establishes it as adeliberate goal, a conscious object. Clearly, then, one of the themselves, scientific knowledge has an important place.

In The repetition of this observation experience contributes toour study, sharing common scientific knowledge (on butterflies) is creating so-called social identity (see development of the self-learning processes.

Quotes (original French version) 1: « J’ai toujours été intéressé par tout ce qui était science. Bon là c’est vraiment très modeste, mais c’est l’idée de se dire qu’on peut participer justement en tant que non scientifique... » (Homme, quarantaine, Ile-de-France, marié, enfants, emploi dans le bâtiment) 2 : « Je suis d’un village d’ici où la nature on s’en fout complètement. Moi j’ai été élevé comme ça. On détruisait, les gens chassaient. On détruisait sans aucune espèce de retenue et les réflexes étaient restés. Même moi je les avais : bon il faut tailler, tondre, éliminer, etc. Même les insectes, enfin tout. » (Homme, cinquantaine, côte Méditerranéenne, marié, employé communal) 3 : « En fait, à partir du moment où j’ai regardé les papillons, j’ai appris, je les ai connus, et c’est vrai que je ne savais pas tout ce qu’il y avait comme diversité. Et ça je trouve que c’est une expérience extraordinaire » (Femme, cinquantaine, Ile-de- France, mariée, enfants, sans profession) 4 : « On s’est aperçu que les papillons, on les voyait sans les voir. (...) Ça faisait partie de l’environnement. Et puis là on commence à observer, on essayait d’observer, on s’est pris au jeu. Alors au début c’était un peu difficile, on a acheté des livres très simples (...) Et c’est devenu un peu un jeu.» (Femme, soixantaine, côte Méditerranéenne, marié, enfants, sans profession) 5 : « Je fais ce que je peux pour les attirer [les papillons]. Ou en tout cas, les garder. Là, cette année, ce qui m'inquiète un peu, c'est que j'ai vu aucune chenille. J'en avais vu au mois de mars, plein de chenilles endormies. Et puis en fin de compte, j'ai pas vu les papillons qui ont éclos. (...) J’ai des petits coins un peu en friche, il y a les orties tout ça où je voudrais retrouver des chenilles. Il n’y a pas une chenille. (...) Donc c'est un peu inquiétant. Et j'ai des radis d'habitude et les piérides comptent là dessus. Là, j'ai des radis qui sont super sains. Donc, bon, j'attends le mois de juillet quoi! Pour être vraiment sûr.» (Femme, trentaine, Ile-de-France, marié, enfants, institutrice) 6 : « Quand on est arrivés ici, on est arrivés il y a plus de vingt ans, il y avait énormément de crapauds. Bon, est ce que c’est l’été 2003 où il a fait extrêmement chaud... Je ne sais pas. Il n’y en a plus quasiment. On a énormément de grenouilles, des rainettes, et puis des grenouilles vertes aussi, mais des crapauds il n’y en a quasiment plus. (...) C’est très étrange. Je ne sais pas pourquoi. » (Femme, soixantaine, côte Méditerranéenne, mariée, emploi associatif) 7 : « Le fait de voir des papillons, pour moi c’est plutôt rassurant dans mon jardin. Je me dis : bon, si ils se portent bien, c’est quand même que ce qu’on fait va dans le bon sens. » (Femme, trentaine, Bretagne, éducatrice) 8 : « Les papillons aussi ça m’a quand même permis de mettre encore un peu plus d’aromatiques parce que bon... on en avait déjà un peu, mais pour pouvoir les observer je me suis dit « tiens on va en rajouter un peu », donc ça a modifié un peu la structure du jardin aussi.» (Homme, quarantaine, Bretagne, marié, enfants, emploi en aménagement du territoire) 9 : « Je compte les papillons. C'est un petit peu un tableau de chasse, donc moins j'emploie de produits insecticides, plus j'ai de la chance d'observer les papillons ». (Femme, trentaine, Ile-de-France, mariée, enfants, institutrice) 10 : « Je suis vraiment amateur, je suis naturaliste, mais amateur. J’ai pas beaucoup le temps donc de prendre des cours et autres...donc je prends mes livres et puis ben j’apprend comme ça sur le terrain. Donc j’ai mes livres d’oiseaux (...) ben maintenant j’ai les livres de papillons évidemment » (Homme, quarantaine, Bretagne, marié, enfants, employé municipal) 11: Moi j’aime bien les prendre [guides naturalistes] avec des photos, parce que c’est vrai que les dessins, déjà enfin on ne voit pas... chacun de nous on a une vision particulière, tiens les couleurs par exemple ça peut varier d’un individu à l’autre (...) mais je l’emporte pas forcément en randonnée (...) Après à la maison, je consulte, (...) après si on retourne sur le site, on peut savoir, on peut reconnaître. (Femme, trentaine, côte Méditerranéenne, emploi dans le bâtiment) 12 : « Le petit dernier qui a cinq ans(...) Il connaît deux, trois quatre noms. Mais il arrive à les reconnaître. Donc, c’est vachement sympa, quoi ! (...) Avant, quand il voyait un papillon, il disait : « Oh ! C’est un papillon ! ». Aujourd’hui, voilà : « </page> <page sequence="15"> ah, un paon du jour, une piéride, un citron... »» (Homme, quarantaine, Ile-de-France, marié, enfants, emploi dans le bâtiment) 13 : « On va voir parce qu’avant on n’avait pas de lotissement...Là, y a quarante maisons, donc on va voir si ça a un impact ou pas... bon ce qui y’a de sûr c’est que effectivement moi maintenant je laisse en friche une petite partie et on voit que tous les papillons viennent dessus. » (Femme, trentaine, Ile-de-France, mariée, enfants, géologue) 14 : « Quand on a le voisin qui traite et qui fait pas comme soi, si on va le voir en lui disant « oh lala, faut pas faire ça », ça marche pas.

Et après bon, soit il adhère, il n’adhère pas, mais au moins... » (Femme, cinquantaine, côte Méditerranéenne, mariée, enfants, chambres d’hôtes) 15 : « C'est bien d'avoir une conscience commune... (...) Mais moi, je trouve que ça manque un peu d'échange, bon des fois on se sent un peu seul quoi. Donc on est quand même à la recherche d'un mouvement qui serait plus large. Et puis aussi pour avoir des informations parce qu'en fait on est seul juge, enfin pour l'instant moi c'est mon cas quoi, on se dit « oui bon ben ça, c'est pas très bien je vais faire autrement » et ce serait bien d'avoir un regard extérieur, à la limite une analyse, parce qu'il y a des choses qu'on voit pas. Du fait qu’on est juge et partie, ça fausse un peu les résultats quoi. » (Femme, quarantaine, côte Méditerranéenne, mariée, enfants, informaticienne)     </page> </plain_text>
