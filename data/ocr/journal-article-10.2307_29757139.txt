<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tucci Himalayan Archives Report, 2 The 1991 Expedition to Himachal Pradesh by Deborah Klimburg-Salter Tor my part, I am quite ready to scale mountains when I find them in my path; [...] But the aim of my expeditions has been quite different; that of revealing and preserving, at least insofar as the record of photography may preserve, the remnants of the civilizations which have succeeded one another in the Himalayan area, and of reconstructing the complex events of the peoples who form a bridge between the Indian sub-continent and Central Asia' (Tucci 1962: 8). This overtly simple manifesto guided Tucci's work from the time he first arrived in India in 1925 until his death in 1984, and has continued to be the goal of the Tucci Himalayan Archive Project. This has involved both the archival problems of identifying, classifying, storing and conserving (see Klimburg-Salter 1985; 1988; 1990; Nalesini in this issue), as well as following Tucci*s footsteps in search of the archaeological and epigraphic documents which would help to explain the civilizations whose remains were, in part, documented in his extensive (c. 16,000 photos) archive. Temples, ruins, inscriptions and chronicles came suddenly upon me as if for centuries they had been awaiting the propitious moment [...]' (Tucci 1962: 4). Our work began with the published expeditions. Having completed the identification of the photos from the Western Himalayan travels ? 1933 and '35 (Fig. 1) we were able to attempt to identify the photographic documents of the expeditions undertaken between 1928 and 1931 when Tucci taught in India. The Tucci Expedition 1931 In addition to visiting historical centers throughout India from Rawalpindi (today Pakistan) to Assam, Tucci collected Tibetan texts and artifacts during voyages to Ladakh and adjacent areas in '28, '29 and '30. In 1931 Tucci returned to Italy for three months during which time he presented a lecture concerning these discoveries to the Royal Academy, in March 1931, and arranged for the publication of earlier and projected expeditions, in a series to be entitled Indo-Tibetica. He also continued his efforts to interest the Italian Government and [1] 13</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 - Tucci and Ghersi in 1933, Spiti valley (E. Ghersi). Courtesy of Gen. Ghersi. people in academic and cultural exchange with India (*). Tucci also pursued the time consuming practical preparations for an extended expedition across high mountains and restricted borders in the Himalayas. He reached Bombay on 1st July and proceeded directly to Simla (the summer capital of the British Raj) in order to obtain the necessary passports for his journey, then to Kashmir for provisioning and hiring Kashmiri attendants. Despite a particularly violent monsoon which had converted the 'prosperous valley of Srinagar into an immense lake' (1933: 246) he reached the Zoji-la (pass) by the 12th of July. The 1931 journey was meant to complement the expedition of 1930 (Tucci 1935: 251) and Tucci's original intention was to travel to Gartok which was not realized. We know from Tucci's publications that his route took him from Ladakh, Rupshu, Lahul, Manali, Saraj, Tiak and return via the Sutlej to Simla (Tucci 1933: 247). However, he did not explain his exact route through Lahul to Kinnaur and Tiak. This year, as a result of our own travels in Lahul and Kinnaur (albeit only as far east as Dabling in the Sutlej valley; see Ghersi's map 10 in Klimburg-Salter 1990) we were able to establish his route via Keylong, etc. (see map drawn by O. Nalesini, Fig. 2). (*) For these lifelong efforts as well as his distinguished scholarship he received the Nehru Prize in 1976. 14 [2]</page><page sequence="3">/ ^^~^&gt;^] -Tucci's 1931 itinerary Kargil : Land above 5000 m. /VN ' \_ \ Km. | biii I I [ i I | ^ N^Mulbekh ^^&lt;halats?

Possibly the restrictions placed by the English authorities caused Tucci to be vague about his itinerary. However, from a few indications in various publications and the photographs in the Archives we may propose: Srinagar, Zoji La, Ladakh, Rupshu Gya, Narachanfiale, Lanchi lung lang, Muldem, Kinlung, Zing zing bar, Dareha, Kyelong, Gondhla, Sissu, Manali, Sultanpur ( = Kulu), Rampur, Sarahan, Chini, Dabling, Shipki, Tiak, and return via the Sutlej valley to Simla. The manuscripts and tsha tsha he collected on this and the 1930 journey were published in Indo-Tibetica, Vols. I and II (Tucci: 1932; 1933). The stark beauty of the landscape unencumbered by asphalt roads and the difficulties of the narrow Hindustan-Tibet route at the Dabling gorge and in Kinnaur (Figs. 3-4) is impressive even in Tucci's small snapshots. On Oct. 21st Tucci reached Tiak. And because of the threatened onset of winter and the danger of blocked passes he decided to return, following the Sutlej (as he did again in 1933) through Kinnaur, then the Bashar state, reaching Simla on Oct. 29. In attempting to follow Tucci's footsteps exactly 60 years later we were not able to match his impressive speed and efficiency in organizing our departure. Despite all the so-called progress in transportation and communication the same process, particularly obtaining the necessary permissions, took considerably longer. Although we should note that in 1931 Tucci was not allowed by the English authorities to travel the more direct route from Ladakh to Gartok, as described by his Italian compatriot, Desideri, some two centuries earlier. Nor did he in 1931 (Tucci 1933: 246) travel through the Spiti valley. Our expedition however, thanks once again to the Indian 16 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4 - Tucci expedition 1933, in the vicinity of the site of Fig. 3 (IsMEO, Tucci Archives, Neg.

Our most sincere thanks go also to Mr M.C. Joshi, Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India with whom we have collaborated on our research. Sixty years later, almost to the day, we also watched the surrounding mountains become increasingly covered with snow. The constant topic of conversation among the local people ? predictions of when the passes would close and how severe the winter would be. The winter of 1990-91 was the longest and coldest in memory resulting in considerable damage to the roads and flooding in the early summer.

[5] 17</page><page sequence="6">IsMEO-University of Vienna Research Expedition The 1991 joint expedition of the IsMEO and the University of Vienna, Institut f?r Tibetologie und Buddhismuskunde, is part of an ongoing research collaboration under the guidance of Dr D. Klimburg-Salter, Prof. L. Petech, Prof. E. Steinkellner and Prof. M. Taddei (3). The expedition, under the leadership of Prof. E. Steinkellner (Univ. of Vienna, CM. of IsMEO), with the assistance of Univ.-Doz. Dr D. Klimburg-Salter (Univ. of Vienna, CM. of IsMEO), consisted of a four-member philological team and a four-member archaeological team. The members of the philological team were Prof. Steinkellner, Dr E. De Rossi Filibeck (Univ. of Rome, O.M. of IsMEO), Dr Jampa Losang Panglung (Bayerische Akad. der Wiss., Munich), Dr H. Tauscher (Univ. of Vienna); the members of the archaeological team were Dr Klimburg-Salter, Mr C Luczanits (Univ. of Vienna), Dr F. Noci (Univ. of Rome, O.M. of IsMEO), Mrs Pat Smith (IsMEO). The team, in three jeeps and an extra truck to carry the generator and some provisions, left Manali at 4:30 in the afternoon following a tremendous thunderstorm, a dramatic reminder of the extreme changes in weather conditions which have been occurring throughout the Himalayas (4). As we were soon to see in Ta pho, and as has already been noticed in Alchi (5), the rather drastic increase in precipitation has accelerated the deterioration of medieval mud-brick buildings and their decoration. We learned on our return to Manali that only hours after our departure the extreme rains caused the closure of the roads and a disastrous landslide in Manali itself. The first night was spent at Marhi, c. 3320 m, in order to acclimatize some of the team members who had only arrived the preceding day from New Delhi, before crossing the Rohtang and Kunzum La passes (4500 m). From Ghersi's altitude profile (fig. 26 in Klimburg-Salter 1990) this would have been camp 3 of the 1933 expedition ? apparently then uninhabited, the tourist-truck stop many decades in the future. The continuous rains did not diminish the stark beauty of the Chandra Valley with its monumental stone boulders randomly strewn across the valley floor during the last ice age. During this journey I had often pause to consider the curious impact of 'art on life', for it was not memories of my earlier journeys through the Chandra valley which came to mind but rather images from the film made by Wolf Kahlen entitled 'Der D?mon im Stein') (6). August 29th we set our camp just before reaching the check post at Losar (camp 10 of the 1933 expedition) in order to enter the restricted area early in the morning and thereby making maximum use of our limited two-week permit. We arrived at Losar as the sun was setting. (3) This research is made possible by grants from the Fonds zur F?rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung and the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

V and 33? north and longitude 77? 73' and 78? 53' east. There is a surface of 7589 sq. km, comprising the Spiti river and its tributaries. All cultivation depends on irrigation. The raw layers of geological history present a veritable geological museum. During each season, and each time of day, the cliffs, mountains, and valleys, spotted with intense color from the sparse flora and the cultivated patches, reflect differing hues. The severe terrain, and climate ? snow cover in the valleys can remain more than six months a year ? means that Spiti is a single crop region, barley and local grains. Animal husbandry is also important; but unlike the neighboring regions there is almost no transhumance beyond the district. All these factors conspire to limit spatial and demographic expansion, thus the traditional pattern of small villages clustered near a water supply is still in evidence. The changes brought in the second half of the 20th century, which opened Spiti to the impact of foreign influences and an abrupt increase in population, has had, and will certainly have, an overwhelming impact on the small, insular population. The changes in Spiti valley which I noticed during the 1989 expedition, after an 11 years absence, were even more marked in 1991. By this time, the new development program, initiated in the past two decades by the Indian government, had begun to demonstrate results in all sectors, reforestation, horticulture, hydro-electric power, education, etc. The process of cultural changes thus set in motion, was intensified by the closure of Tibet and the resulting loss of access to the traditional cultural, educational and economic exchange systems. However, in recent years, the impact of high ranking Lamas (Dalai Lama and the Sa skya Trinzin in particular) and other Tibetan refugees have had an invigorating influence on the Buddhist culture (see discussion on Icags mkhar), although overall the number of men and women entering the monasteries seems to be declining as a result of increased economic opportunities. A recent study estimates that the traditional balance between the population of c. 5,000 men and 10,000-12,000 animals has been altered ? with the population rising to 1.5 times the latter number during the summer months and a steady increase in the birth rate (Sanan 1991). At the same time, the positive effects of the distribution of land to the landless and, those having little land, and the increase in irrigation and energy resources has been accompanied by some negative effects on the physical environment. Fortunately, some government officials are aware of the fragile balance of factors which has traditionally sustained the population of the Spiti valley under the extreme climatic circumstances of this high altitude, cold desert environment. Although primary economic data are not available, based on the art historical evidence, it would seem that during only two phases in the last millennium had political, cultural and economic factors conspired to produce a cultural florescence, in the llth-12th centuries and in the 15th-16th centuries. Despite considerable [7] 19</page><page sequence="8">destruction during the 19th century Dogra wars (see Steinkellner's article in this issue), the artistic remains still testify to a vibrant Buddhist culture which was part of the contemporaneous culture of the international Buddhist community. Apparently, it is thanks to the limited economic resources that there was relatively little unnecessary refurbishing of these monuments, although, of course, new chapels and mchod rten were built at other times as well. Unfortunately, we have no economic documents for the early period (the 'second diffusion of Buddhism') and the necessary research has not been conducted on the economy of Spiti during the later period (c. 15th-16th centuries). Nonetheless, it is well known that at both times there was a strong political center in western Tibet and/or Ladakh and that as a result, long distance luxury trade in this region flourished. The high value ? low volume ratio which characterized this luxury trade was extremely important since the severe climate, geography, and high altitude makes transportation in bulk difficult (Sanan 1991). To what degree the Spiti valley was involved in this trade network is an important question. We know that, since the 17th century, the ' trade route between India, Tibet and China was along the Sutlej, the Indus, and the Beas river valleys. The lack of any important mineral resources, in Spiti itself, meant that trade was limited to barley surplus and wool cloth as well as secondary commodities traded up from Kinnaur and Kulu (the latter having diverse mineral resources). This self-sufficient but extremely basic economy certainly could not have generated the surplus necessary for the building and decorating of chapels and monasteries on such a luxurious scale. How then was this accomplished? This is certainly one of the more important questions which future research must address. There would seem to be only two possibilities: that funding came from outside the valley and/or from the surplus from a luxury long-distance international trade. According to Sanan's (1991) understanding 'Spiti was never located on an important trade route'. However, when Gu ge was a political center and the north-south traffic to Central Asia and China an important economic factor, Spiti may have become an important secondary trade route. Evidence for involvement in the long-distance international trade network is contained in the story of the 'Piti Thakurs' ( = chiefs of Spiti) who were said to have established settlements at strategic mountain strongholds along the 'ancient trade route(s) from Ladakh and Tibet Proper to Rampur Bashar' (Hutchison &amp; Vogel 1919: 155, passim). On the morning of the 30th August, we registered with the office of the joint D.C. at Kaza (Kaja) (7), on the north bank of the Spiti river, and reached Ta pho by mid afternoon. The dramatic climatic changes can be appreciated by comparing an observation recorded on the same day in the Spiti valley in 1847 by a British civil servant who speaks of a desert climate with few trees. Today, all along our route, the river was bordered by stands of poplar trees and shrubs. (7) We would like to thank Mr Sushil Negi for his continued assistance and interest in our expedition. Mr Negi was also kind enough to assist Mr Luczanits during the 1990 expedition to Ta pho. 20 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Spiti - Ta pho Through the continued assistance and kind interest of the Abbot of Ta pho monastery, Geshe bSod nams dBan 'dus, we were able to accomplish our principle goals despite the restricted time. The expedition work was divided between research on the Kanjur (see report by Steinkellner in the same issue) and the archaeological recording of the monastery. Our goal was to try to understand the earliest periods of construction and decoration at Ta pho monastery and towards this end to finish the documentation of the relevant parts of the site through photography, preparation of plans, and drawings. The primary focus of Dr Noci's work was to prepare an architectural study of the monument, and for this purpose he has prepared a preliminary plan of the entire Ta pho chos 'khor, which has never before been accomplished to this degree. His second goal was to prepare a plan of the Ta pho gTsug lag khan with a view to understanding its original structure (see plan by F. Noci, Fig. 5) (8). Although it was built approximately 1000 years ago the gTsug lag khan appears to have experienced relatively little rebuilding. Nonetheless, as the monastery has been under repair and conservation by the Archaeological Survey of India (Sengupta in Klimburg-Salter 1982) for the last twenty-five years, and thus now has a number of structural changes, it is somewhat difficult to estimate the chronology without being able to perform any archaeological investigations. Nonetheless, on the basis of first-hand observation, measurements, and comparison with old photographs, Dr Noci was able to propose, as a working hypothesis, that the plan of the gTsug lag khan, as it now stands ? old sGo khan, 'Du khan and a cella with ambulatory ? appears to be original (9). The present new sGo khan is probably an enlargement of an earlier atrium or porch (see plan, Fig. 5). The date of the mGon khan is at present difficult to determine. All the paintings there belong to a later period than the paintings in the yDu khan. Although the present plan of the gTsug lag khan is unusual, parts of the original building, as proposed by Dr Noci, are found in temples of the region dating to the 'second diffusion of Buddhism', such as a shallow porch and an interior skor lam or ambulatory. Nothing contradicts the hypothesis that the present roofing system is based on the original conception. The location and extent of repairs, however, remains to be determined. The date of the present ceiling is of particular interest because of the paintings on cloth between the beams. These paintings are in an unusual style that, until now, can not be securely dated. The presence of a ceiling painting from Gumrang, Lahul, with one of the Ta pho motifs does not yet assist us in establishing (8) We would like to thank our driver Galden Chhimed who, despite no previous experience, quickly adapted to the equipment and Dr Noci's needs and ably assisted him in measuring all of the buildings which were surveyed during our expedition. (9) We use the term gTsug lag khan to refer to the large building which today consists of entry, mGon khan, sGo khan, 'Du khan, ambulatory and cella. This term however is not without its problems. In the final publication we will discuss Tibetan architectural designations. [9] 21</page><page sequence="10">pi lip I 0 5 10" i_i_j_i_i?I--l Fig. 5 - Ta pho, gTsag &amp;g Plan (F. Noci).</page><page sequence="11">a chronology for the Ta pho paintings (see Luczanits in this issue). The same phenomenon but with different patterns exists at Alchi where, however, the paintings between the beams are directly on the wood and not on cloth. Thus, the Alchi technique appears to follow Ta pho. Ceiling decorations imitating textile patterns existed earlier as well (e.g. the painted ceilings of cave temples at B?miy?n and Ajanta), but Ta pho is the only temple known to me where actual painted cloth decorates the ceiling. Indeed, textile patterns and techniques shown on costumes worn by many figures ? secular and lay ? in the 'Du khan wall paintings are carefully depicted. The hypothesis that they represent actual textiles was the point of departure for a research project presently being conducted by Erna Wandl at the University of Vienna. To date, the patterns have been identified in western Indian manuscript paintings c. 12th century and textile fragments from Fust at in the Ashmolean Museum. A detailed investigation of these Fustat textiles is currently being pursued with Dr Ruth Barnes, from the Ashmolean. An important question for future investigation is the nature of trade contacts between Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. Pat Smith divided her time between making drawings of specific architectural features and important iconographic elements which were too destroyed to permit adequate photography. sGo khan In addition to Dr Noci's work, the most important result of the 1991 campaign was the description and documentation of a previously obscure, early phase of the gTsug lag khan. These paintings had not been studied by Tucci. This phase, which was hardly detectable, is now revealed as a result of the cleaning of the paintings by the Archaeological Survey of India ( = A.S.1.) and because of the introduction of sky lights. The earliest level of painting at Ta pho can now be discerned under the present painting in the ambulatory and in the old sGo khan, which apparently was never repainted. The remains in the ambulatory are extremely fragmentary, nonetheless, we are able to propose the working hypothesis that the earliest layer of painting in the ambulatory and all of the paintings in the sGo khan belong to the same period. This painting is distinguished from the later three phases (Klimburg-Salter 1985) by the quality and colors of the paint, the style and the iconography. The paint is extremely thin with an extremely weak binding material so that the color is easily rubbed off the wall. Therefore, in part, the present extremely faded condition of the paintings in the sGo khan. The palette is extremely limited, dominated by a pale blue-green, light pink, rose, red, white and black with touches of blue. The iconography of the sGo khan will represent a major chapter in our study of Ta pho. To briefly summarize: One enters the original sGo khan from the east. The east wall is very destroyed but there are most interesting fragments. To the proper right [in 23</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 6 - Ta pho, sGo khan, Wi nu myin and retinue (Dep. CS Neg. 17656/6; F. Noci). of the entrance are the fragmentary remains of a Wheel of Life. In the upper (northern) corner is a fragmentary inscription which has been identified by Dr Panglung (Panglung Rinpoche) as coming from the Vinaya of the M?lasarv?stiv?dins (10). Also in the northeast corner is the only figure of a Buddha in the sGo khan. It is seated on a lotus with upturned petals which can be compared to fragments of the early paintings in the ambulatory. In the southern corner at the top of the wall there are multiple vertical lines and under this a scale. This composition may have been a cosmological drawing. Over the doorway leading to the 'Du khan, is a painting of a protectress riding a reindeer and accompanied by her retinue of 18 female attendants, nine to each side. She is identified by inscription as Wi nu myin (Fig. 6), a name unknown in Tibetan Buddhist traditions but perhaps having analogy in the Bon tradition. The composition is painted in a rather flat style without the sometimes strong shading found on the north wall. Unfortunately the goddess is destroyed ? only the head of her vehicle has survived. Her attendants are dressed in the typical western Tibetan style, long cape, long hair with many necklaces and head jewellery composed of blue stones. The only unusual dress is worn by the woman leading the group to the right of center and proffering an offering. She wears a short red, flower patterned jacket (Fig. 7): similar jackets are known from Central Asia. The rest wear long capes. (10) The location of the Wheel of Life in the vestibule is traditional in Buddhist monasteries. 24 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 7 - Ta pho, sGo khan, deities on south wall (C. Luczanits). In our forthcoming Archive publication it will be demonstrated how the protectress of the gTsug lag khan subtly changes her identity through the various chronological stages in the monastery. The north and south walls (Figs. 8-9) have a parallel composition. At the top of each wall is a decorative floral band under which are today preserved eight rows, three rows of deities, and five rows of figures. The latter rows are divided conceptually in the middle. To the east of the center in the first three rows are the secular figures, to the right, the monastic. The three members of the royal house, depicted on the south wall, are seated on footed thrones as are all the princely figures (identified by the inscription Lha sras) on the north wall. All other figures are either seated, or in the lowest row kneeling, on the ground. The south wall is the best preserved. From the top row to the west of the center line are represented a community of monks. They are identified in the inscriptions dge1 slon and by their monastic dress. In the 4th row appear to be nuns and the lowest preserved row contains secular figures. The style of the sGo khan paintings is extremely unusual within the context of western Himalayan painting and we would propose that they are the earliest wall paintings yet to be found in Himachal Pradesh. Based on a preliminary impression, however, they seem to be most closely related, not only in style but also in iconography, [13] 25</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 8 - Ta pho, sGo khan, north wall (Dep. CS 17656/8; F. Noci). to drawings and paintings from Central Asia particularly to some found in Tun huang. The problem with the relevant Tun huang drawings and paintings is, that, until now, they have been grouped together in a very general way using various terminologies such as the 'Himalayan style' (Klimburg-Salter 1982: 117-18). The intention of this designation was to distinguish this group from the Tun huang pictorial images in the Chinese style. In fact, the non-Chinese paintings form a number of stylistic sub-groups, some of which have Thibetan inscriptions (e.g. Klimburg-Salter 1982: pi. 74) and, apparently some also have distinguishing technical features. Recently Gropp, supported by Whitfield (Gropp 1974; Whitfield 1982), has suggested the possibility that a well known group of silk banners may have been made in Khotan and imported into Tun huang (n). Further, while some of the drawings and paintings in the 'Himalayan style' can be associated with Tibetan inscriptions, some cannot. And some paintings which are actually in a Chinese style have Tibetan inscriptions. Clearly an important problem (n) Gropp's suggestion is based not only on the distinctive style which he believes can be compared to fragments of painting from Bez?klik but also to the weave of the banners which is different from other silk banners found at Tun huang and therefore suggests another place of manufacture. Tibetan tradition considers Khotan to be one source of their artistic tradition. 26 [14]</page><page sequence="15">in the analysis of the Ta pho sGo khan paintings is the chronology and origin of some of the comparative imagery from Central Asia. In addition to the stylistic group just discussed, other paintings in the sGo khan must be considered evidence of a regional style. That this latter style is used to represent the historical figures and the protectress {Wi nu my in) and her retinue is probably significant. Fig. 9 - Ta pho, sGo khan, south wall (C. Luczanits). Inscriptions Certainly the most troublesome of the many art historical problems at Ta pho is the fundamental question of chronology. Unfortunately, internal evidence for an absolute chronology is missing. The situation is not clarified in the literary sources, on the contrary, there is no agreement regarding absolute dates for the patrons of the temple, the kings of Pu 'ran-Gu ge. In fact, the available literary sources are so sketchy and contradictory that Ta pho itself is one of the major sources of evidence for the period. The evidence from, and problems with, the literary sources pertaining to this question will be presented by Petech (forthcoming). Here I will only briefly summarize my present hypotheses based on the last seasons finds. The main temple (gTsug lag khan) and the chos 'khor belong, to a large degree, to the original conception of the complex. A number of other structures, such as the dKyil khan, gSer khan, and Byams pa lha khan have elements which appear to connect them to the early period but they are completely repainted. A number of changes have occurred in the monastery which seem to fall into distinct chronological phases, some of which are documented in the inscriptions (Klimburg-Salter 1987: 687-90). [15] 27</page><page sequence="16">At the moment we have concerned ourselves only with the first phase of construction and renovation which we see as a homogeneous cultural period roughly corresponding to the moment of greatest political stability of the kings of Pu 'ran-Gu ge, from the later part of the 10th century (the reign of Ye ses 'od) to the end of the 11th century (Petech, forthcoming). During this period Ta pho appears to have been a major center of translation and learning, perhaps occupying an important position in the propagation of Buddhism in ICog la (12) as did Nar ma in Ladakh and mTho glin in mNa' ris {ibid). From the artistic remains, known almost exclusively from photos in the Tucci Archives, Khojanath, in Pu 'ran the original political center of this dynasty, may have been the earliest Buddhist center of this dynasty, but its continuing role is not clear. Of principal importance is therefore the astonishingly large number of inscriptions at Ta pho. The almost 1000 years old wall inscriptions are often difficult to read. It is only thanks to the combined efforts of a number of people over many years that it is now possible to transcribe these inscriptions. Luczanits, who had first recorded the sGo khan inscriptions during his visit to Ta pho in 1990, was now able to verify his readings assisted by other members of the team (13) who also independently read the inscriptions. The analysis of the philological, historical and doctrinal contexts still lies before us. Based on my 1978 field research, I published some preliminary notes on the 'Du khan inscriptions (Klimburg-Salter 1982; 1987) (14). This year, thanks to the cleaning, new sky lights, and our generator, the conditions for reading, in particular controlling earlier readings, were optimal (Fig. 13). The inscriptions in the gTsug lag khan are of 2 kinds, religious and historical ? religious inscriptions consist of identifications of images and quotations from religious texts: The Gandavy?ha of the Avatamsaka literary corpus (Klimburg-Salter 1982: 158-59; 1987: 696-97), and the Ksitigarbha-s?tra (15). The former is being prepared for publication by E. Steinkellner and the latter by H. Tauscher. The historical inscriptions can be divided into three sub-categories according to their location: sGo khan, 'Du khan and entrance to the cella. These inscriptions form two rough chronological groups, 10th-11th centuries and later. We have primarily concerned ourselves with the inscriptions belonging to the earliest phase of the monastery. This cultural unity is indicated by a common orthography, and content (12) We have several indications for this term as summarized by Petech (forthcoming). Today this designation refers to the region of Po-Tabo-Lari. But it is probable that originally a larger area was implied ? perhaps the entire lower Spiti valley which would include Nako, today in Kinnaur. (13) I would like to thank in particular Prof. Steinkellner and Dr Panglung Rinpoche. (14) The correction to 1987: 690; PI.

Tauscher's photographs taken in 1989 form the basis of the new translations of the religious texts. See summary of Steinkellner (forthcoming). 28 [16]</page><page sequence="17">such as names of people and places. Similarities and changes in nomenclature can be understood as having a chronological significance. On a second visit to Ta pho (October 1991) we were fortunate to be accompanied by Tshe rin rdo rje. He recorded most of the later medieval inscriptions in connection with his long standing study of local history. Thanks to the evidence of the inscriptions in the gTsug lag khan, we have the names of a large number of historical personages, some famous, most unknown. The earliest group of historical inscriptions in the sGo khan lists monks who came from places (or belonged to clans) bearing non-Tibetan names. They perhaps referred to local places, and may be connected with the history of Zan zun. The most frequently found place or clan name is snel 'or and then mag pi tsa. A significant cultural change can be seen when one compares this list to the list of abbots preserved in the late 17th century chronicle the Vaid?rya Serpo. Tucci believed this latter information was taken from the census ordered by the 5th Dalai Lama (1971: 475). There, names are typically Tibetan and the places of origin are usually in the vicinity, such as Ta pho itself (rTa po) or La ri. To some degree the evidence of the inscriptions and the art historical remains confirm the picture presented by literary sources, but there are also inconsistencies. A preliminary hypothesis which would permit us to integrate the various types of information as one now understands them: Painted during the first phase of activity at Ta pho, the inscriptions in the sGo khan record Ye ses 'od and his two sons Na ga ra dza and De ba ra dza (Fig. 10). They are seated on thrones, each under an umbrella and the three are placed at the center of the composition. However, the placement of the figures is a bit confusing. Ye ses 'od is in the middle which is the place of honor, and his two sons are to either side and turned towards him, he also appears slightly larger. But, Lha btsun pa De ba ra dza is separated from the others by vertical lines, he is at the middle point, just before the line of monks, and is also the only royal figure to clearly wear monastic dress. Could he have been the Abbot of the Ta pho community? The short title preceding chen po Ye ses 'od in the inscription is not clear, it seems to read d slob. He is not called a Bodhisattva. One may assume that the painting was produced during his life time, thus between A.D. 996 and c. 1036. Since the colors and style seem quite primitive, and in any case earlier than the Kashmiri influenced painting, one may suppose they were indeed painted before the earliest surviving paintings in the 'Du khan. As it was customary to decorate the walls at the time a temple was built, a reasonable hypothesis is that the entire first phase (surviving fragments in sGo khan and ambulatory) date to 996. On the north and south walls a relatively large number of original inscriptions identifying monks (dge' slon), princes, and nuns remain. There are about 30 names in the five rows of historical personages on the south wall. Of these, particularly significant, as we shall see, is the fourth monk in the first row after Lha btsun pa De ba ra dza (Fig. 11). He is identified as snel 'or dge slon 'Dul ba by an chub. Fragments of eighteen names survive on the north wall. [17] 29</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 10 - Ta pho, sGo kban, Ye s'es od and his son De ba ra dza (C. Luczanits). The function of these paintings, which occupy a large amount of space on the lower halves of the north and south walls, is not at all clear. No directly comparable paintings have survived. Groups of religious figures occupying less space, and usually in less prominent locations, remain in several early monasteries but their function appears to have been different. For example, in gSum brtsegs Alchi, on the third floor (where they are functionally not visible) there is a row of religious figures which appears to be the 'Bri khun pa lineage up to the time of the temple's founding (Goepper 1990: 163-65). From mTho glih, Tucci (1934: 238) published three photographs, each with a group of three monks which may date to the 11th century; the first group represents the three religious kings of Tibet, and in the painting in the adjacent panel two monks are identified in the inscriptions, first Lha btsun pa De ba bra pa and the center larger figure as Lha bla ma Ye ses yod, the third figure is not visible on the photograph. Another painting also from mTho glih has no inscription but is similar to the painting in the Ta pho dKyilkhan (Tucci 1934: 237) and thus may also represent monk-kings {Lha bla ma) of Pu 'ran-Gu ge. In any case it is clear that one is dealing here with a sort of visual topos. Certain features are standard elements of the type. The throne, the umbrella over each head, the curtain behind the main image(s) gathered 30 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 11 - Ta pho, sGo khany row of monks with sNel 'or dge' slon 'Dul ba byan chub (C. Luczanits). in peaked folds with the highest point at the center, and the followers, worldly and monastic, placed behind the curtain. We note that the painting accompanying the Byan chub 'od inscription in Ta pho (Fig. 12) includes all these conventions. The painting in the sGo khan, however, has only some of these elements (the curtain and onlookers are missing) which is another indication that this painting is earlier than the painting with the Byan chub 'od inscription and the mTho glih paintings. The Ta pho sGo khan paintings are distinguished by the large number of personages belonging to all the important social categories relevant to a religious institution. It may be that the paintings represent an assembly of some kind ? perhaps at the time the monastery was founded. An interesting corollary is found in bSod nams rise mo and transmitted also by Sa sky a pandita. Apparently in 1016 Ye ses 'od met with his two sons in order to formally set up the administration of Gu ge proper 'as a sort of theocratical estate' (discussed in more detail in Petech, forthcoming). Petech's interpretation would concur with the special placement of De ba ra dza at Ta pho. Unclear is why Na ga ra dza (called prince) is seated with the worldly figures and wears secular dress. Was he not yet ordained? Ye ses 'od also wears secular dress, although he was already ordained. Ye ses 'od is his ordination name. [19] 31</page><page sequence="20">Here we have only briefly referred to a few of the problems posed by these paintings. However, they contain an enormous potential fund of information concerning local customs and social hierarchy, the inscriptions are also an important source of geographic and proper names. Fig. 12 - Ta pho, 'Du khany inscription no. 1 (Byiah chub 'od inscription) (C. Luczanits). Suggested Chronology of Ta pho gTsug lag khan In addition to the inscriptions there are extensive architectural decorations consisting of painting and sculpture. Unfortunately a comparative stylistic analysis has so far yielded only limited results with regard to chronology. A proper understanding of the stylistic variations would also eventually assist us in a better understanding of the meaning and function of the iconography. There are, however, a number of major difficulties in evaluating the stylistic history of the gTsug lag khan. At the moment, on technical as well as stylistic grounds, one can only clearly distinguish three phases ? early (Ye ses 'od), middle (Rin chen bzan po? and By an chub 'od, consisting of three stylistic groups A, B, C, Klimburg-Salter 1985) and late, the various very late repairs, i.e. on both sides of the door. The difficulties in refining this stylistic analysis ? and particularly dating the all important groups of the second phase ? are several. We have very little directly comparable art historical material. And that which exists is without a clear historical context. In addition, we have no understanding of the production of art during that period. 32 [20]</page><page sequence="21">It is evident from the mss. folios (see below) and photos in the Tucci Archives of murals at Man nan, among others, that there was a wide range of shared stylistic and iconographic elements throughout the kingdom of the kings of Pu 'rah-Gu ge. This led to two, as yet untested hypotheses ? that artists were itinerant, and that patronage played a decisive role in the production of art, particularly royal patronage. But even the organization of a workshop and the production of art in a single monastery is totally obscure. Ta pho itself is too small to have permanently supported a workshop with enough craftsmen to have decorated the gTsug lag khan. (Although two-three residence monk artists would have been always possible ? just as is the case today). During a particularly active phase of artistic production a group of craftsmen could have been occupied for several years. In the extreme cold of the long winter it is difficult to imagine work on the architectural decoration. Therefore one might imagine that work was confined to several months. How large was a workshop? How many men would have worked at Ta pho in one season? How much painting or sculpture could one man produce? Or one team? The next season perhaps the same or other artists from the same workshop came ? thus producing certain small differences. This can be seen in the painted valance in the ambulatory. We presume that the patron played a significant role. In this case the similarity between Man nah and Ta pho might be accounted for by By ah chub 'od's patronage. Then we have the problem of pounces and molds. All the figures in the mandala were made with molds. How long would these have been kept and used? Would they be the property of the artists and carried from place to place, or that of the monastery and thus stored and used decades later for repair? And then there is the question of local tradition, the presence of a particularly famous person, or the tradition of certain rituals which are maintained for 100's of years. We have no indication that the living tradition in Ta pho was ever broken until perhaps briefly after the Dogra destruction in the 19th century (although, Steinkellner (in this issue) proposes several phases in the destruction of the Kanjur). At least during the medieval period the story of the illustrious patrons of Ta pho was certainly well known. If a particular vision or teaching was associated with the iconography of the 'Du khan then the respect for this tradition would have encouraged the local people to make any necessary repairs consistent with the original. This in fact is the only way to understand the remarkable survival of the sGo khan. Certainly the inscriptions, which even today are readable, confirm the presence of Lha bla ma Ye ses 'od, the Bodhisattva, and his two sons. Even the question of patronage is not so simple as might appear from the inscriptions. Did the presence of the royal patrons necessarily exclude co-participation by other donors? Were the Abbots during the llth-12th centuries and perhaps even later related to the royal family ? as seems likely from the pattern in the Vaid?rya Serpo. In this case, one would assume a continuing conservatism maintaining the original artistic and iconographic traditions and thus it would be even more [21] 33</page><page sequence="22">difficult to differentiate chronological phases. The combined evidence of the com? parative stylistic analysis and the inscrip? tions lead us to propose the following preliminary model for the two early phases of artistic activity at Ta pho. The 11th century inscriptions are all in the 'Du khan. Inscription no. 1, painted 46 years after the founding of the temple (A.D. 1042), refers to Ye ses 'od as the grandfather, the Bodhisattva and one may assume that he was then deceased. Byan chub 'od is referred to twice as Lha btsun pa and one may assume he was alive at the time. Also apparently still alive but now a person of significant importance ? perhaps the Abbot of Ta pho, is 'Dul ba byan chub, who now appears with the title gNas brtan (16). There is no doubt that this is the same person as in the sGo khan inscriptions. Because in the 'Du khan inscription to the right of the entry (Fig. 13, fn. 14 and above, inscription no. 1) he is also found at the head of the community of monks, he is again identified as gNas brtan and coming from snel 'or (gNas brtan chen po 'Dul ba byan chub snel 'or / ta po yi dge 'dun sde chen po) (17). Rin chen bzah po is not found either in the relatively well preserved inscription no. 1 or the poorly preserved but contemporaneous inscriptions in the 'Du khan, nor in the earlier sGo khan (he would have been in the first row of monks which is completely preserved). In fact, he occurs in none of the inscriptions from Ta pho, excepting a modern painting in the new entrance hall. Most of the painting in the 'Du khan, with the exception of the uppermost row (see Klimburg-Salter 1985: 18-40, group 'B' and group 'C respectively) and some of Fig. 13 - Ta pho, 'Du khan, gNas brtan chen po 'Dul ba byan chub / sNel 'or (C. Luczanits). (16) There is no doubt that there are two distinct persons. The royal blama Byan chub 'od is specifically referred to in inscription no. 1 with the tide Lha btsun pa. The monk is named 'Dul ba by ah chub. (17) In Pritzker (1989) the Tibetan inscription is written correctly, but wrongly translated because 'od has been added to the name by the translator. 34 [22]</page><page sequence="23">the paintings on the external wall of the cella, where the inscription no. 1 is located, were created during the period of renovation under By an chub 'od, referred to in inscription no. 1. I have earlier suggested (1985) that these paintings are later than the so-called group 'A' to which the Bodhisattvas painted on the south and north walls of the ambulatory belong. Thus, to the three stylistic groups earlier defined (Klimburg Salter 1985) can be added a 4th, earlier stylistic group, located in the sGo khan, and also discernable under the paintings in the ambulatory. The problem is what dates can be attributed to these phases. At this point it is necessary to note that, the information contained in our inscriptions does not totally agree with some important literary sources. In both Rin chen bzah po's biography (a later redaction) and the Vaid?rya Serpo, Rin chen bzah po is considered to have been the founder of Ta pho chos 'khor. Earlier, I had relied on the literary tradition that Rin chen bzah po was co-responsible for founding Ta pho, and therefore proposed that Ta pho must be placed after Rin chen bzan po's second journey to Kashmir, since it occurs in the list of 'smaller foundations' (which cannot refer to its size) (see Klimburg-Salter 1985: 33-36 for discussion). The other monasteries known to have belonged to the first period of monastic foundations (Nar ma, mTho gliri (mTho dlin) and Kojarnath) are not in this list. In the forthcoming Archive publication an historical model which allows us to accept both the inscriptional evidence in the gTsug lag khan, which omits Rin chen bzan po, and the literary traditions, as well as Petech's new chronology for the kings of Pu 'rah-Gu ge, and which respects the art historical evidence will be proposed. Petech proposes that Rin chen bzah po returned from Kashmir after 1003, at which time he brought with him the large number of Kashmiri artists, books and liturgical artifacts which initiated the flowering of Kashmiri artistic influence in western Tibet. We may propose that Ye ses 'od had founded Ta pho during the first phase of his missionary activity. The first artistic phase at Ta pho (as seen today in the sGo khan), shows no Kashmiri influence and is indeed technically inferior to the later artistic phases. As Ye ses 'od is the name taken by the former king after his ordination, the paintings were made after Ye ses od's ordination c. 985. The most likely monkey year prior to Rin chen bzah po's second return from Kashmir is 996. However, 984 was also a monkey year and as Tibetan dates do not directly correspond to our solar calendar and the dates for Ye ses 'od are only hypothetical, he might indeed have received his initiation in 984; and Ta pho may also have been founded in the same year. At least one son, De ha ra dza, has a title indicating that he was already ordained. The large size of Ta pho gTsug lag khan is evidence of its importance, and it is natural that Ye ses 'od (or Lha lde) may have wished this royal foundation to be refurbished in the new style. As we have no inscriptional evidence for Rin chen bzah po's activity at Ta pho, defining the nature of his contribution is highly speculative. However, in addition to the literary tradition, another indication for Rin chen bzah po's participation is the iconographic program of the 'Du khan. Careful study has confirmed Tucci's first impression that the entire program of the 'Du khan is a [23] 35</page><page sequence="24">conceptual and aesthetic unity which is at the same time simple and intellectually consistent. Although there are at least two and perhaps three stylistically different but related groups of paintings, all the images can be understood as supporting the same scheme. There is abundant evidence from Tibetan hagiographies {rnam that) that important Lamas would plan the decoration of the temple in all its detail. Usually on the basis of a dream or vision. Although it is certainly possible that the iconographic conception was conceived by Byah chub 'od, or rebuilt on a model first constructed by Ye ses 'od, such a vision would rather seem to be the work of a great teacher. It is precisely in this role also that his biography presents Rin chen bzah po. In this case, a very hypothetical model would then see a major rebuilding and redecoration by Kashmiri artisans sometime soon after 1003 under the guidance of Rin chen bzah po and probably also Ye ses 'od who was still alive. The 33 seated figures of the mandala in the 'Du khan are clearly in Kashmiri style, although the 'Du khan paintings appear slightly later (see below) (Klimburg-Salter 1985: 16-18). There are, of course, certain indications for the location and the extent of repairs in the gTsug lag khan but they are not conclusive. One curious fact is that not a single trace of the pre-Kashmiri, or any earlier painting, can be seen under the present murals in the 'Du khan although a fragment is discernible under the Ksitigarbha inscription at the entrance to the ambulatory (18). The cella and the ambulatory where the 10th century paintings are found were bonded to the 'Du khan walls in the late 10th century as they are today, and the 'Du khan originally must have also been decorated (see plan, Fig. 5). The only possible explanation for the total disappearance of this earliest phase from the 'Du khan walls was the destruction of the wall (not just the repainting as in the ambulatory). Such a destruction could have been caused in several ways. Either a violent attack on the monastery, or an earthquake, or the deliberate dismantling of the wall in order to insert the struts for the seated mandala images (Klimburg-Salter 1985: 18). Thus, one likely explanation is that Rin chen bzah po was responsible for constructing the main iconographic program of the temple ? the Vajradh?tu mandala. In A.D. 1042 (or 1030) Byah chub 'od renovated the gTsug lag khan again. Most of the paintings in the 'Du khan can be attributed to this phase. A terminus post quern for Ta pho is provided by the paintings at Man nan which may have been created by the same artists who worked at Ta pho. We have already demonstrated the close similarity between style group 'C in Ta pho and Man nan (Klimburg-Salter 1985: 18-40). The Vaid?rya Serpo attributes Man nan to Byah chub 'od and says that Atisa resided there. Thus, the latest possible date for Man nan and Ta pho group 'C is 1045 when Atisa left for central Tibet. Therefore, 996 is the latest possible date when Ta pho could have been founded. A critical factor in understanding the nature of the Byah chub 'od renovation is the precise interpretation of the first lines of his inscription. The monk (dge sloh) (18) We exclude here the obviously new (20th century) additions. 36 [24]</page><page sequence="25">who wrote the inscription (his name is not quite clear although rendered by Tucci as Phes kha rgyu bdag) says that By ah chub 'od 'renovated' the temple igTsug lag khan) 46 years after Ye ses 'od founded it and that the present inscription (no. 1) was written after the painting of the chapel (Dri gtsan khan) was completed. What exactly does the verb imply, that the temple was refurbished or rebuilt? And, what is the Dri gtsan khan and why does he make the distinction here? Based on younger sources one may propose that Dri gtsan khan is the inner chapel (i.e. here the cella). However, Chandra Das considers the term as a synonym for gTsug lag khan. Does the writer mean to give the redecoration of the Dri gtsan khan particular importance or does he merely mean to say that it was completed last ? perhaps as much as a year later (i.e. in c. A.D. 1043)? Certainly, the location of the large inscription next to the entrance to the cella is somewhat unusual. It is not clear if the remaining five statues can be attributed to the Byah chub 'od renovation (Fig. 14). It has been difficult to understand the chronological place of the five clay statues in and in front of the cella. Also the iconographic function of the five figures is not clear, and a number of important paintings in this area, including the ceiling paintings on cloth, do not fit into the four stylistic groups belonging to the first two phases as now defined. This then forms the agenda of our present research program. To summarize, our previously proposed chronology would be amended through the additions of an earlier pre-Kashmiri artistic phase attributable to the founding date A.D. 996 under Ye ses 'od. The true Kashmiri style (group 'A' in Klimburg Salter 1985, e.g. painted Bodhisattvas in the ambulatory), could be attributed to the early 11th century under Rin chen bzah po (presumably together with Ye ses 'od) and groups 'B' and 'C, most of the rest of the paintings in the 'Du khan, to Byah chub 'od's renovation in 1042 (see Klimburg-Salter 1985 for further discussion). We have chosen to call this phase the true 'Western Himalayan' style because it is a synthesis of the two earlier artistic phases which contributed both regional and Kashmiri elements. This can be clearly seen in the Nor bzahs cycle. [25] 37</page><page sequence="26">Naturally, there are many details, problems, and questions not addressed by this rough outline. And it would be pre-mature to consider the foregoing as anything but a working hypotheses, an attempt to give shape to the evidence now available to us, in the hope that other students of the ,period may contribute to the dialogue and process of understanding the temple and its chronology. Fig. 15 - Ta pho, wooden architectural fragment (D. Klimburg-Salter). Incidental Architectural Wood Decoration During 1991 one of the large mChod rten next to the 'Du khan developed a hole and a large carved wooden lintel was found inside. It was generally considered to have been a fragment of an abandoned religious building which had been deposited within the mChod rten, rather than a part of the mChod rten itself. The deeply carved floral and figurative elements (Fig. 15) were in a different style from either the surviving, but much eroded wooden door frames, or the other sculptural fragments at Ta pho photographed by Tucci. Each deeply carved floral rondel was occupied by a seated Bodhisattva figure ? the tri-partite division of the torso, garments, jewelry and crown resemble Kashmiri models, such as the copper alloy Avat?ra frame in the Sri Pratap Singh Museum, but even more, the high crown and large knots and streamers of wooden figures from Alchi 'Du khan and Ropa (see below). 38 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 16 - Lalung, village in 1991 (C. Luczanits). Spiti ? Lalung Among the smaller Lha khan in the Spiti valley the most important to survive, that we know of, is the chapel in Lalung on the Lingti river. Lalung (beginning with Shuttleworth we find the' Tibetanized 'Lha lurV but know of no primary evidence for this spelling) was visited by Tucci and Ghersi on their 1933 trip; it was earlier visited by Shuttleworth in 1924 and subsequently also by Khosla in 1968 (Khosla 1979: 48-53). Inexplicably Khosla says '[...] The village of Lalung is situated a short march away from Drangkhar the ancient capital of Spiti. There is nothing very distinctive about the village and its historical importance really lies in the fact that it was chosen by Rin chen bzah po or his successors as the site for a temple [...] why an obscure village along the Lingti river should have been chosen as a site for the Lalung temple remains a mystery' (ibid.: 48-49). In contrast to this impression, Lalung appeared to us to have an extremely favorable setting. Today, it seems a prosperous village with well cultivated fields all around the slopes of the hill leading down towards the river (Fig. 16). The valley beyond the village, according to the reports of the villagers, offers extremely fertile summer pasturage for their Yaks. According to Harcourt in the early 19th century Kashmir authorities considered the Lingti river as the border between Lahul and Ladakh (repr. 1972: 8). [27] 39</page><page sequence="28">We were received most hospitality by the villagers who, in response to our question about old manuscripts took us to the village doctor-herbalist. A practitioner of traditional Tibetan medicine, he did indeed have a collection of manuscripts related to his profession. Even more interesting was his altar which contained a collection of painted wooden sculptures and wooden mChod rten dating from the c. 15th-17th century (Fig. 18). We were under the impression that they had come from a local temple. However, in Prof. Wolf Kahlen's slide collection we later noticed the missing parts of the same altar which Kahlen had photographed in 1986 in Kyibar. From this fact we now assume that the sculptures come from a destroyed ancient temple somewhere in the general region. The temple itself lies at the crest of the mountain above the village. The temple is painted white with a red stripe on the top and above that is a roofing of twigs and mud (Fig. 17). The main building consists of one story with a half story above which is completely empty and appears to have been too shallow to have served any function other than as a protection zone like an attic. This plan is well suited to an area of heavy snowfall and is not unique. In front of the entrance to the chapel is a sacred pond with an enormous willow tree which appears, from its extraordinary dimensions, to be many hundred years old. That the pond and tree are sacred can be seen from the fact that the skor lam which allows the sacred circumambulation goes around not only the chapel but also the tree and pond. Lying to the west of the entrance to the temple, at some distance is another small chapel which is totally devoid of any decoration and contains only a fourfold image of Vairocana (Fig. 19). This chapel is part of another building which we could not enter (19). In Shuttleworth's time the building was inhabited by local lamas. A line of much ruined mChod rten can be seen descending the mountain from the temple to the village. Returning to the temple. If one compares Shuttleworth's plan with the plan drawn by Noci (Fig. 20) one sees that the bsTan 'gyur, gSer khan, and ambulatory, as well as a very narrow room running along the side wall of the gSer kahn existed also in 1924. According to the brief survey which Dr Noci was able to undertake it seems to be a reasonable hypothesis that these last three structures perhaps with a porch or another structure allowing access to the ambulatory belonged to an early date. However, the relative chronology remains to be determined. The only decoration which was described by Tucci is that of the spectacular gSer khan (Fig. 21). The decoration of the small room in front of the gSer khan, called the bsTan 'gyur (Fig. 22), appears to be of a more recent date. The gSer khan (19) Tucci in Indo-Tibetica says that in a closed chapel next to the lha khan (referring to what is actually called the gSer khan) the Vairocana image is situated. This is not actually correct as there are the pond and the tree and other buildings between them. In the future, the buildings lying between the two chapels should be investigated. During our visit this was not possible. 40 [28]</page><page sequence="29">Fig. 17 - Lalung, Lha khan (Dep. CS 17658/28; F. Noci). Fig. 18 - Lalung, altar (C. Luczanits).

His careful description of the painting verifies that the present paint has been faithfully copied over the original. It would seem that Shuttleworth's enthusiasm for the temple encouraged this renovation, because by Tucci's visit in 1933 it was in its present state. The paintings of the ambulatory have not been noticed until now by scholars. At the back part of the ambulatory, on the right wall there are six seated Buddha figures, on the left of the ambulatory are seven Buddhas (Fig. 24), only the upper parts of the Buddhas survive and some monks and donor figures. The style of these figures is rather provincial but there is some relationship to a painting attributed to western Tibet, 14th century (Beguin 1990: pi. 4; ms. page in the Fournier Collection, Musee Guimet). Shuttleworth recorded seeing two inscriptions which Gergen copied for him and sent to Francke. We have not yet been able to trace the copy of these inscriptions. However, fragments of the founding inscription survive to the proper right of the entry. Luczanits together with Steinkellner and Panglung recorded the badly destroyed 44 [32]</page><page sequence="33">Fig. 25 - Lalung, gSer khad (C. Luczanits). Fig. 26 - Lalung, cletail of sculpture (C. Luczanits). [33] 45</page><page sequence="34">inscription. It is not mentioned by Tucci. The inscription will be published together with a complete description of Lalung in the forthcoming Archive publication. Particularly remarkable are not only the graceful sculptures but also the different forms of the architectural frames inhabited by the deities. The palaces, as they are known in the texts, show a close relationship to those depicted in the paintings at Ta pho. The style of the sculptural figures at Lalung ? the largish facial features, broad shoulders, large hands, feet and head, and also the form of the robe are different from those at Ta pho. The wall paintings are not mentioned by Tucci in his description, although they can be glimpsed in Ghersi's photographs. They seem quite closely related to paintings in Alchi 'Du khan. Moreover, an extremely fascinating detail is a courtly group which is intimately connected with Alchi (Fig. 25). These relationships to Alchi 'Du khan would suggest a date after the middle of the 12th century when Spiti was conquered by King Lha chen Utpala of Ladakh (Fig. 26). A date towards the end of the 12th century would seem to best coincide with the latest research on the chronology of Alchi (Goepper 1990). Lahul The joint IsMEO-University of Vienna archaeological team visited Lahul from Sept. 13-23. Our objective was to study artistic and architectural monuments which would assist us in understanding the art history of the monuments Tucci had visited in Spiti and Kinnaur, and to verify Tucci's itinerary in 1931 (see above). We would particularly like to thank the Deputy Commissioner of Lahul-Spiti, Mr Narinder Chauhan, I.A.S., for his kind assistance. We are also indebted to Tshe rih rdo rje who shared with us his extensive knowledge of local history and often accompanied us during the following weeks in Lahul and Spiti. Lahul (known to the Tibetans as Gar za or less frequently dKar zva) is the geographic and economic crossroads of a cultural zone which stretches from Kulu to Kashmir and Ladakh to Kinnaur. At times this entire region belonged nominally to a single political unit, although in fact the local chiefs (Thakur) ruled their own territory and paid tribute to the central political institution. According to both the Kulu genealogy of kings, vans?vali, and the Ladakh chronicles, there were several moments during the early medieval period when Lahul played a pivotal role in the trade between Ladakh and Kulu. Although the history of the early periods is extremely obscure, in Hsuen Tsang's time (mid 7th century), Kulu appears to have been a large and prosperous state. It is also possible that one of the early Karakota kings of Kashmir may have conquered part of Kulu (Hutchison &amp; Vogel 1919: 132-34). Western Himachal (Kulu in the largest sense) had silver, iron, gold and crystal among other natural resources. It was Lahul's role to exchange these goods for those coming from the north and the south along the trade network ? for barley, wood, borax, salt and 46 [34]</page><page sequence="35">dzos, woven woolen textiles ? and from the further reaches of the international trade network came the precious commodities from Central Asia ? including silk and jade. From further south came spices, and cotton fabrics from India. Lahul also played a pivotal role in the relay of artistic influences. Goetz has eloquently described the relationship of the early medieval art of Lahul to the arts of the Gurjara-Pratihara on the one hand and the kingdom of Pu 'ran-Gu ge on the other (Goetz 1955: 117). Thanks to the increased number of known monuments and also to improved documentation, now it should be possible to refine more precisely the art historical interrelationship so broadly conceived by Goetz. The administrative center of Lahul is at Kyelong (Kye lah or sometimes Kye glah) located on the north bank of the Bh?g? river. Kyelong is located along the main route between Ladakh and Kulu-Manali. Today the bazaar has expanded rather unattractively in order to accommodate the increase in foreign tourism. The Moravian mission had its headquarters here from 1857 to 1940. At earlier times, however, the main route ran along the south bank of the Bh?g? through the ancient capital of Kardang. The earlier importance of Kardang as a Buddhist center can still be seen from the rock engraved Buddhist images [c. 10th-11th century) now standing in the middle of the village (Fig. 27). Following the route from Kardang along the south bank of the Bh?g? we first visited the interesting small monastery Labjang. After a short walk further along the river we arrived at the almost deserted hamlet called Johling (zo lin). There we visited a chapel called by the local people Lha bla ma Lha khan which we took to refer to Lhd bla ma Ye ses 'od. This may be the same chapel which is attributed to Rin chen bzan po in his biography where it is included in the list of 21 smaller temples as zho lin (Snellgrove &amp; Skorupski 1980: 95, 108). Other authors have noted that a temple by this name is attributed to the period (Lauf 1971: 369; Singh 1983: 144; Handa 1987: 185) but none of them describe or discuss the temple. The small single-celled Lha khan is oriented east-west. It is now in total ruin (Fig. 28; see sketch plan by F. Noci, Fig. 29). Nonetheless it is still revered by the local people who were quite distressed by our visit and watched us carefully to make sure we did not touch anything. A harvest offering recently had been placed in the middle of the temple, before the former altar. Arranged on three sides of the temple, excepting the entrance wall were remains of at least fifteen wooden st?pas (Fig. 30). These are probably later additions to the original temple. They have the same form, which appears typical of Lahul, as the wooden st?pas in Gumrang which are placed along one wall of the Lha khan. The latter most certainly do not belong to the initial phase of the temple as there are traces of wall painting behind them (see Luczanits same issue). The stone walls are today completely unadorned, the roof collapsed, and almost all of the other wooden elements are missing. However, we were told by two persons, that the interior of the building originally had been covered with wooden carvings. A British official acquired a Buddha image from Johling in Kyelong which is now in the British Museum (Klimburg-Salter 1982: 73). The figure wears a crown and jewels [35] 47</page><page sequence="36">A~I Fig. 27 Kardang, rock engraved Bodhisattvas (C. Luczanits). Fig. 28 - Johling, Lha khan (D. Klimburg-Salter). 48 [36]</page><page sequence="37">together with monastic dress and is seated on a peacock, traces of red paint remain (Fig. 30bis). This large Amit?bha figure was probably part of a set of five Jinas. Although essentially different in style from the Buddha-figure in the nearby and roughly contemporaneous Devi temple at Udaipur, certain features ? the face with blotted cheeks and high arched eyebrows ? do permit comparison with the Udaipur carvings (Figs. 37-38). Some time ago Tshe rih rdo rje took the last remaining sculpture to the Chamba Museum. We were unable to visit the museum so we unfortunately have no idea what this sculpture looks like. Other sculptures may have been removed earlier. Cunningham deposited a wooden Buddha image in the Chamba Museum (published in Aryan 1984-85: pi. XI, where she discusses the image's origins and Ohri 1991: pi. 5.55, without information). Indeed, a careful investigation reveals not only a large number of wooden objects of various functions (e.g. architectural decoration, free standing sculptures, shrines, Buddhist ceremonial crowns) in Western and Indian collections but an astonishingly large number still in monasteries and homes in Himachal Pradesh. These objects need to be documented and systematically defined and compared. It is certain that there were more Buddhist temples of this period and some of them most likely still contain some indication of earlier artistic activity. One such is Gumrang (Gun rah) a small chapel on a slope north of the lower Bh?g? valley about one and a half hours walk from Kyelong. This chapel still contains clay figures which originally belonged to a mandala of Sarvavid Vairocana, and is discussed in a separate article by Luczanits (same issue).

Mirkula Devi Temple, Udaipur One of the most important surviving monuments for the history of art in Himachal Pradesh is the small wooden temple in the center of the bazaar at Udaipur (see Noci, this issue, fig. 2). According to Vogel (1911: 15) R?ja Udai Singh (1690-1720) changed the name of the village to Udaipur from Markul?. Considering its good state of preservation and the beauty of its wood carving, it is astonishing that so little has been written about it. The only substantial study is by Goetz (1955: 90-117) using also material gathered earlier by Vogel (1911 and notes to Goetz 1955). Nonetheless the principal questions regarding the shrine remain unresolved ? chronology and function. Due to the limited time at our disposal we were able to spend only one 50 [38]</page><page sequence="39">day at Udaipur (September 18th). Here we must limit ourselves to sharing the documentation which we were able to collect and some descriptive notes. The art historical discussion is limited to the main temple ? the western structure on the plan (see Noci, this issue, fig. 1), and to the earliest period of the decoration. Goetz suggested that the building had two main building periods. To the later building period would belong two smaller pillars in front of the main sanctuary, the architraves of the ceiling in front of the sanctuary, and the panels on the inside of the window, he would also attribute the standing dv?rap?las (see Noci, this issue, fig. 11) to this phase though I believe they may be later. During his visit in the summer of 1939 the two figures stood to either side of the main sancturary covered with the blood of sacrificed animals. Today they stand to either side of the door and there is no trace of animal sacrifice in the shrine. The Thakur of Gondhla told us that the carved decoration on his family Lha khan was produced by the same Bengali sculptor who had fashioned the dv?rap?las. Goetz believed this phase could be dated to the same period as the present cult image. Vogel (1911: 248 ff.) discusses the dedicatory inscription which is written in late sarad? script, and a very corrupt Sanskrit. The image was dedicated by Thakur Imap?la (1569-70). The door to the temple (see Noci, this issue, figs. 12-13) has Kafir-like motifs different from anything else in the temple but similar to motifs in small unidentified local shrines. This door is not mentioned by earlier researchers. (See Noci, this issue). The earlier phase consists of the wooden facade of the inner sanctuary (garbhagrha) (see Noci, this issue, fig. 5), the ceiling of the mandapa and the four main pillars. Goetz suggested that this part of the temple dated to the early 11th century but was based on a 7th-8th century model. Here we shall not concern ourselves with whether or not these carvings date to the 10th or 11th century, but it is interesting to note that based on the location of the early panels, the original location of the south wall and the size of the ambulatory is questionable (see Noci's discussion of the architectural evidence). This point is interesting because the present plan (enclosed ambulatory and shrine on mandapa) can be related to earlier Hindu temples of India (e.g. Aihole) as well as contemporaneous Buddhist temples (i.e. Poo Lo tsa ba lha kan and Ta pho gTsug lag kan). The later, however, have flat roofs, while the Mirkul? Devi temple has a peaked roof. The question of the identification of the original function of the temple is somewhat confused by the present 16th century cult image, a Mahis?suramardinl (Maxwell 1980: 52). It is generally thought that the temple was originally dedicated to S?rya (Maxwell 1980: 50) but the identification of some of the key images on the doorway is unclear. Goetz gives a detailed description of the carvings of the facade (1955: 98-100) of the garbhagrha. The monumental doorway is composed of seven vertical frames, the second from the inside is a row of Visnu Avat?ras (Fig. 31). Above the doorway to the inner sanctum are three horizontal rows of deeply carved figures. On the vertical axis of the door are three images one above the other (see Noci, this issue, fig. 10). Maxwell only discusses the upper (Fig. 32) and the middle image (Fig. 33) ? the latter he identifies as S?rya but he is unable to identify the former. He does not mention [39] 51</page><page sequence="40">Fig. 31 - Udaipur, Mirkul? Devi temple, detail of portal to garbha grha, Visnu Avat?ra (C. Luczanits). Vogel ? Goetz's identifications. Thus presumably he rejects their notion that the images above the door are the Grahas. There are indeed several difficulties with this identification, causing Goetz to offer differing interpretations ? including the possibility that the lower image placed just above the door and not mentioned by Maxwell (Fig. 34) is S?rya and the image above it (Maxwell's S?rya) is Chandra. As can be seen from Figures 32 and 33, both figures carry astral emblems and ride in carriages drawn by seven animals. The middle figure (Fig. 33) appears to be horses but this is not absolutely clear, while in the lower figure (Fig. 34) the animals are simply too destroyed. The ceiling of the mandapa is decorated with a magnificent stylized lotus (Fig. 35) where one row of petals is replaced by a circle of vajras (Fig. 36), the lotus is set in a 'latern roof framed with four oblong and four square carved panels. The panel 52 [40]</page><page sequence="41">Figs. 32-34 - Udaipur, Mirkul? Devi temple, portal to garbhagrha, central figures: upper row (Fig. 32), 2nd row, S?rya? (Fig. 33), just above door (Fig. 34) (C. Luczanits).</page><page sequence="42">Fig. 35 - Udaipur, Mirkula Devi temple, ceiling of mandapa (C. Luczanits). on the west contains a six-armed dancing Siva with his family ? P?rvati, Ganesa, K?rtikeya, and Nandi, the northern panel contains a well known image of Buddha overcoming the temptations of M?ra (Fig. 37). Although Goetz acknowledged the aesthetic unity of the composition ? 'costumes and other details, technique and style are the same' (p. 98) ? he found the presence of Buddhist motifs so disturbing that he contradicted his own art historical analysis and proposed that the Buddha panel and vajras were the result of a later repair. I quote the paragraph in full because it is a rather extreme example of the tendency to transform art history into romantic fiction, rather than confining oneself to objective analysis, when confronted with unfamiliar and unexpected elements in ancient or medieval monuments. 'Some decades later king Lha-chen Utpala (c. 1080-1110) invaded and conquered Kulu, and apparently also Lahul [...] May we assume that after this conquest the Markul? Devi temple was converted into a shrine of M?richi-vajrav?r?chi, the Lamaistic light-goddess? And that on this occasion part of the ceiling, probably broken by an avalanche, was replaced, i.e. the center-piece with the tw/ra-petal frieze and the "Assault of M?ra"? For the differences in style are almost imperceptible [italics mine], so that they can be only separated by a few decades at the utmost' (p. 113). In fact if we compare the Buddha image (Fig. 37) in the ceiling with the Buddha image represented on the left side of 54 [42]</page><page sequence="43">Fig. 36 - Udaipur, Mirkul? Devi temple, ceiling of mandapa (C. Luczanits). the door to the sanctum, at the top of the frieze of Visnu Avat?ra (Fig. 38) we find no difference in style ? note the long ears jutting out from the side of the face, the carving of the robe, the decoration of the pillow. There is no doubt that all of these early carvings were produced at the same time. The vajras and the S?kyamuni on the ceiling, as also the image of the Buddha Avat?ra, were simply Buddhist elements integrated into Hindu iconography. We would choose to see this iconographic program as characteristic of the eclectic imagery which characterized the upper valleys of Himachal Pradesh. A phenomenon discussed by Goetz himself on many occasions. Maxwell (1980) makes several interesting sociological observations in his analysis of the 'transformation' of some local shrines during several periods. However, I am not sure how useful it is to view the initial phase of the Mirkul? Devi shrine in light of sectarian tensions. Maxwell uses the phrase '[...] Buddhist pressure of the kind we saw rejected at the temple of Mirkul? Devf (1980: 64). On the other hand, it is true that all public monuments are in some way a reflection of their historical environment and it is thus important to note that the temple presumably dedicated to S?rya was built at about the same time as the two Buddhist chapels at Gumrang and Johling. Rock engravings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas throughout the area further [43] 55</page><page sequence="44">Fig. 37 - Udaipur, Mirkul? Devi temple, ceiling of Fig. 38 - Udaipur, Mirkul? Devi temple, facade of mandapa, S?kyamuni and the temptation by M?ra garbbagrha, Buddha Avat?ra (C. Luczanits). (C. Luczanits). testify to widespread Buddhist activity. At the same time, in the same areas, we have fountain stones decorated with Hindu imagery. According to Vogel's translations of inscriptions on stylistically similar stones, they can be dated to about the same time (c. 10th-12th century) and demonstrate that at least some of the ruling classes continued to worship Hindu deities (Vogel 1911: 25-39). The phenomena of Tantrism, and the fluid boundaries between Buddhism and Hinduism in the eastern and western Himalayas, has been discussed often (see Staal 1982 for a particularly provocative discussion of this theme). Throughout the Tibetan cultural sphere, 1991 was pilgrimage year. The pilgrimage cycle in Himachal Pradesh included a circuit walked between Trilokanath and the Mirkul? Devi K?li temple. In the former, devotions were watched over by a Tibetan Lama and in the latter p?j? was performed according to Hindu custom. Heterogeneous popular ritual practice has ancient roots. Excavations at a Buddhist center in Afghanistan have revealed the existence of eclectic cults as early as the 8th century (Taddei 1973; Taddei &amp; Verardi 1978: 47-58). In the same regions and periods, the cult of S?rya flourished. This was also the case throughout Pakistan, Kashmir, 56 [44]</page><page sequence="45">and Kulu (in the larger sense), where (Diserens 1981; 1983) images of S?rya are ubiquitous on the early medieval Hindu shrines. According to Goetz this cult flourished from the 6th-10th centuries (Goetz 1955: 50) which would place the S?rya temple at Udaipur at the close of this period. Not only were cult practices not neatly distinguished between Hinduism and Buddhism, but also the use of artistic motifs was not necessarily confined to a single religion or region. The half-palmette decorative band found on the inner frame of the sanctuary door at Udaipur also appears on the door of the Lha kan at Gumrang; the architectural frames isolating the deities are used in analogous ways on the monumental doors from Alchi and mTho lin (Klimburg-Salter 1988: fig. 2), as well as in the portable arts, e.g. one of several known examples photographed by Tucci/ Ghersi at Ta pho in 1933 (Tucci 1935: pis. XLVI, XLVII). Although this motif always has been traced to Kashmir, it is so ubiquitous in the art of Himachal Pradesh and Guge that the Kashmiri connection is no longer meaningful. At this point, it would be more useful, to define more carefully the many wooden art objects, Hindu and Buddhist, monumental and portable, and try to trace the relationship between them. It is possible, for instance, to observe that the mTho lin portal, which is more complex than the door at Udaipur, appears to have been the inspiration for the Alchi 'Du khan portal which in turn is far more complex in format and in its multiplication of iconographic themes and decorative motifs than the portals at mTho gliii and Udaipur. And, while the architectural motifs at Udaipur show close relationships to other wooden architecture of the region ? for instance the ceiling decoration is related to the wooden ceiling of the Sakti Devi temple at Chatrarhi ? also individual motifs can be found in the stone architecture of the region. The temple at Udaipur is a key monument for the study of the arts of the period and one can only hope that it will be the focus of a monographic study in the near future. Gondhla We spent the following two days at the beautifully situated little rest-house in Gondhla, in the Tinan district on the upper Chandra River. The largest building in Lahul was said to have been the Thakur's castle, of which only the famous tower remains (Fig. 39). However, a painting in the Thakur's house and a fuzzy snapshot taken by Tucci in 1931, and several descriptions (e.g. Harcourt, repr. 1972: 100) give a clear idea of its former imposing size. We would like to thank the Thakur Fateh Chand and his family for their kind hospitality. Along the former main road of the village (the present asphalted road is considerably higher up) are three large-scale engravings of three Bodhisattvas ? Avalokitesvara, Maitreya, and a Padmap?ni (the object held in the left hand is awkward for a lotus but I cannot imagine what else it can be). Because of their large size and the foliage no complete picture was possible (Fig. 40). Another indication of earlier Buddhist activity was a manuscript of the Lalitavistara which can [45] 57</page><page sequence="46">Fig. 39 - Gondhla, tower (drawing by Pat Smith). 58 [46]</page><page sequence="47">be tentatively dated ? on the basis of the paleography, orthography, and the style of the images (Figs. 41-42), particularly the Bodhisattva figures, to c. the 11th-12th centuries (see the section on Poo regarding manuscript discoveries). Fig. 40 - Gondhla, rock-engraved Bodhisattva (C. Luczanits). KlNNAUR Due to the time limit of our permit we were only able to spend a few days in Kinnaur. We would particularly like to thank the Deputy Commissioner of Kinnaur, Deepak Sonan for his interest in our research and for assisting us in our work, and also for sharing with us his unpublished manuscript cited above (20). Kinnaur (with various spellings most particularly Kunawar, in the local language Kanauring) is one of the most culturally fascinating regions in northwest India. Despite a number of western travellers since the early 19th century very little is known about this relatively small, and mountainous region with its ancient and complex cultural levels. It lies between 31? 05' 55" to 32? 05' 20" N latitude and 77? 44' 0" to 79? 0' 50 " E longitude, it has a surface of 6,553 sq. km, a population, as of the census (20) We would also like to thank Mr and Mrs Deepek and Dhanu Sonan for their kind hospitality in Kalpa. [47] 59</page><page sequence="48">Fig. 41 - Gondhla, Lalitavistara (C. Luczanits). [48]</page><page sequence="49">of 1981, of 59,547. The hydrological basin of the Sutlej nowhere opens into a broad plain, and Kinnaur consists of a series of rocky and precipitous ravines descending rapidly to the bed of the principal river, the Sutlej (Singh 1990: 244). Both Francke (1908) and Tucci (1935 etc.) briefly passed through Kinnaur (Tucci three times) but both were following the main caravan route and their destination was elsewhere, so that they did not have time to explore the many villages in side valleys that claim to have ancient Buddhist temples. In recent years there have been several surveys and travelogues published in India dealing with Himachal Pradesh. Government restrictions have prevented foreigners from working in the area (21) and until now no single monographic study on any aspect of the Buddhist culture has appeared. However, the first two volumes of Indo-Tibetica published by Tucci in 1932/3 were based on material collected by him in part in Kinnaur and Lahul during his expeditions in 1928, 1930 and 1931 (see map, Fig. 2). Although this isolation has limited our scholarly knowledge of the region it has most certainly assisted the people in maintaining their artistic culture intact. We most urgently hope that once this region is open to tourism the government is able to support its intention to protect the artistic treasures of the region with the most stringent means. Both Francke and Tucci attempted to combine their understanding of Tibetan history and culture based on written sources, with observations of the contemporary culture ? language, art, architectural and archaeological remains. F.A. Peter, a Moravian missionary, lived in Ladakh and Lahul from 1930-1940. During this time he collected information about place names throughout the region and some interesting information can be obtained from his glossary (1975). The considerably different impressions which each of them reported, combined with my own observations, reflect the progressive socio-economic and cultural changes which have occurred during the 20th century. At the beginning of the 20th century Tibetan culture was discernable further westward along the Sutlej than in the 1930's. In recent decades, Tibetan Buddhism is again expanding. The degree of Tibetanization, which was introduced during the period of the 'second diffusion of Buddhism' and which can only be inferred from the archaeological remains, is difficult to evaluate. The extreme cultural-political changes which occurred in Kinnaur, as in Ladakh, in the 16th-17th centuries disrupted the ancient Buddhist culture. Nonetheless, traditional trade contacts with Tibet which were maintained by the Bashahr kings from the 17th century until 1962 (Singh 1990: 245; Petech 1977: appendix B) testify to the economic interconnection between Tibet, Kinnaur, Spiti, Lahul, Ladakh, Central Asia and the plains of India (Singh 1990: 256). The increase in Indianization which characterizes the 20th century has been somewhat tempered by the impact of high ranking Tibetan Lamas which has caused a revival of Tibetan Buddhism, manifested, for instance, in the construction of new temples, such as in Poo and Ropa. (21) Again we thank M.S. Negi and the Lama of Poo for their interest and assistance. [49] 61</page><page sequence="50">However, the presence of non-Buddhist beliefs and deities, some of which can be identified with animistic cults, and the continuing importance of these cults, parallel to the Buddhist cults, does suggest a strong pre-Buddhist substrata, as already described at length by Francke and Tucci. The manner, process and chronology of Tibetan influence in the region thus remains a fascinating and little explored problem. There is no doubt that Poo remains, as already noted by Tucci, a focal point for such a study. Poo Our purpose was to study again the monuments we had first visited in 1989 (Klimburg-Salter 1990). Our emphasis here too was on the 10th-12th centuries. Our comments on the finds from the region are severely limited by the lack of primary research on Kinnaur. A systematic search through the primary literature must begin with a definition of the geographic terms. In Rin chen bzah po's biography the area around Poo (sPu), upper Kinnaur, appears to have been called Ron chun (Snellgrove &amp; Skorupski 1980: 95). Poo, north of the Sutlej river, today consists of a modern center occupied by the Indian administrative buildings, and the ancient villages of Poo, and dKor where the early medieval monuments are located. Today Poo is a thriving trade center which has recently completed an impressive new Buddhist temple financed totally by community contributions and painted by Tibetan artists from Dharamsala. This village must always have been the cultural and economic center of upper Kinnaur. A Moravian mission was located here from 1865-1915. Poo has several important remains from our period which will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming Archive publication. Poo is mentioned in Rin chen bzah po's biography (Snellgrove &amp; Skorupski 1980: 95) where it is written sPu. The same orthography is found on the Ye ses 'od stone inscription from dKor (Klimburg-Salter 1990: 48; 1991). There is also a small Lha khan (Lo tsa ha lha khan) attributed to Rin chen bzah po. Although no original decoration is left, the plan of the temple ? a small inner chapel with an ambulatory placed at the back of the 'Du khan ? is found in all the other early temples of the region. Two of the several stone monoliths in the village called rdo rin by the local Lama are also located near the Lha khan together with a pile of mani stones and prayer flags, and one is built into the back wall of the Lha khan. None of these monoliths, except the one from dKor, has ancient inscriptions. Preserved in the Lo ha ba lha khan, is a Prajn?p?ramit? manuscript of great importance. Lovingly cared for by the community throughout the last millennium it is still in an almost perfect condition. The manuscript is quite large as can be seen in relation to the man holding the covers (Fig. 43). The beautifully carved wooden covers may be contemporaneous or a century later. Similar covers have been published by various authors and usually dated from 12th-13th century. But a systematic analysis of early Tibetan carved wooden covers is yet to be accomplished (Klimburg-Salter 1991). 62 [50]</page><page sequence="51">Fig. 43 - Poo, detail of wooden cover to Prajnaparatnit? (C. Luczanits). The manuscript belongs to the large-size category (Steinkellner in the same issue), having ten lines of text ? on fine beige paper, in a beautiful and very readable dbu can script. Both the style of the images, painted on every page, and the conjunction of paleographic features suggest a c. llth-12th century date. The Poo manuscript is of unique importance. As it is as yet the only complete Tibetan manuscript with illustrations from such an early date known, it assists us in the complex process of chronological attribution: the style of the illuminations is particularly helpful in distinguishing between genuinely early manuscripts, copies of same, or medieval manuscripts written in archaic styles. When all the formal features of the manuscript itself, the calligraphy and images are consistent, and with no trace of error ? misunderstood copying, or anachronistic intrusions ? then we feel safe in proposing an early date. Obviously the larger the number of pictorial features, the greater the analytical possibilities. Thus the date for the Poo manuscript is more secure that the separate folios from Ta pho or even the Lalitavistara from Lahul which has only Buddha and a very few Bodhisattva images. The frontispiece (Fig. 44) is painted on a dark blue rectangle with square paintings to each side on white paper (the relative date of the sketch in the upper left corner is unclear). The title page, the only one to be damaged, is written in silver (?) ink. The painting on one side depicts a preaching Buddha (Fig. 45) and on the other the conquest of M?ra (Fig. 46). They are painted in vivid primary colors. [51] 63</page><page sequence="52">Fig. 44 - Poo, frontispiece of Prajn?p?ramit? (C. Luczanits). There are two more large rectangular paintings of scenes from the Life of the Buddha, and each page is illuminated with small Buddhas. The great variety in skill suggests that several members of a workshop contributed to the manuscript ? with differing results (Fig. 47). The style and individual motifs have numerous points of comparison with the Ta pho JDu khan paintings as well as the Ta pho ms. folios (Figs. 48-50) and folios found by Tucci and Ghersi in mTho glin (which are now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ? Pal 1983: 125, pi. j). Despite the great difference in scale between the Ta pho 'Du khan wall painting and the tiny miniature paintings, points of comparison can be noticed: the same western Tibetan dress ? the women wear a long cape, many necklaces, head ornaments composed of blue stones; the men with their wide-lapelled, tight-waisted chuba over long pants and high felt boots, a large blue stone at the front of the neck; also the drawing of the Buddha figure. It is not possible here to examine the ms. paintings in detail; rather I have elsewhere raised some problems concerning the origin of this western Tibetan ms. painting tradition and its impact on the later school of Tibetan ms. painting (22). These questions are quite important as it is now clear that there was a prolific school of manuscript production in western Tibet and that in every possible way, except the subject of the manuscripts, this tradition was distinct from that known in contemporaneous India or Nepal.

Ropa The list of the foundations in Rin chen bzari po's biography appears to follow a quasi-geographical order and this was one of the guides which Tucci used in attempting to locate the chapels attributed to him. In addition to which, throughout the region, there persists the local tradition that certain chapels were founded during the time of the 'the second diffusion of Buddhism', although the names of Rin chen bzan po's twenty-one smaller temples recorded in the biography, are often difficult to identify with modern names. Ro dpag (or Ro pag) may be the modern Ropa in the Ropa valley (23). (23) We are indebted to our friend Lama bSod nams who told us about Ropa and kindly accompanied us on our visit. [55] 67</page><page sequence="56">N V o OP Oo h~Z?o Fig. 51 - Ropa, Lo tsa ba Lha khan. Plan (C. Luczanits). Ropa is beautifully situated on a mountainside in the Ropa valley. The village appears (like Poo) to have an elder and a newer part. When inquiring for the Lha khan we were first taken to a newly built chapel in the newer part of Ropa. The chapel was chiefly interesting for its plan which included a covered ambulatory around the exterior and for the fact that at the time of our visit the Buddhist temple was serving as the temporary home of the village Devat? (24). Seated in a palanquin, she was covered with several layers of cloth and 4a hairy looking' headdress. The Devat?'s usual resting place, lower down in the old village, was under repair. Below the new village, in the center of the old village, is a small chapel known as the Lo tsa ba Lha khan (plan by C. Luczanits, Fig. 51). The Lha khan consists of two rooms which are actually two separate buildings ? the fore-room, a later addition, is not even completely bonded to the original building, as can be seen from the outside. The original entrance to the small chapel can be seen from the massive wooden door entered from the front chapel. The front chapel has a small shallow porch. The Lha khan is built of stone with wooden intermediate courses and a wooden superstructure. The small back chapel is distinguished by a lower floor level and different masonry. There is also a small window in the side wall. The sKor lam (pradaksinapatha) is found on the outside of this cella. Over the centuries worshippers have built up a massive mani wall along the outside wall of the chapel. The apse has a raised platform on (24) Locally pronounced 'Devta'. We had neglected to ask its name but it may be Candika, who is reported at both Ropa and Yuwaringi (Singh 1990: 249). 68 [56]</page><page sequence="57">Fig. 52 - Ropa, five Tath?gatas with wooden sculptures on altar (C. Luczanits). which are seated five clay Tath?gatas ? three along the back wall, one each along the side (Fig. 52). Each of them is painted in a different color. According to the present color scheme Vairocana is in the center, as is traditional in all the early temples. This follows the preference found in the mandalas of the Yoga Tantras. However, this figure appears to be in dhy?namudr? which might suggest Amit?bha. However, in early Vajray?na iconography Vairocana is often depicted in dhy?namudr? holding a dharmacakra (Klimburg-Salter 1982: pi. 61). In front of the side walls of the apse are a pair of white Bodhisattvas (Fig. 53), both in laltt?sana, between them and in front of the apse is an altar, at present containing nine mainly wooden sculptures in different sizes and belonging to different periods. Three of the sculptures appear stylistically related to the seated clay Bodhisattvas. Two seated Bodhisattvas appear to be in a style already familiar from the 11th-12th century art of Spiti (Ta pho and Lalung). While a six-armed female figure is rather in Kashmiri style as are the spectacular standing wooden Bodhisattvas (to whom we shall return). The date of the clay statues is difficult to determine. The heads often appear to be too awkwardly placed on the necks as also are parts of the hands and arms, which may result from frequent repairs. A more detailed first hand examination is necessary. It may well be that the original statues were medieval in date but often repaired. This is suggested'by the pointed top of the Buddha figure's slender, oval halo, also the [57] 69</page><page sequence="58">Fig. 53 - Ropa, Lo tsa ba Lha khan. A Bodhisattva (C. Luczanits). form of the 'descent-from-heaven st?pa' (mChod rten) at the apex of the halo (Fig. 54). This st?pa shape is found from the 7th century from the Hindu Kush to Kashmir and Spiti. In Ta pho (Fig. 55) a similar st?pa occurs at the apex of the Vairocana sculpture in the 'Du khan. Also the shape and decor of the crown placed on large rosettes above the ears suggests a medieval date. On either side of the door is a guardian figure, a red Hayagriva (Fig. 56) and a blue Mah?k?la. As with the seated clay images the date of the guardian figures is difficult to determine. The fact that they each have only one head and two arms, and a semi-ferocious demeanor suggests an early date. This is also suggested by the structure of the head and torso as well as the shapes of the headdresses which have affinity to Central Asia (25). (25) Hayagriva is one of the oldest of the Tantric figures known in Northwest India, as attested to by the beautiful seated figure from Kashmir, c. 8th century (Klimburg-Salter 1982: 20), in the St. Louis Museum of Art. I thank Prof. John Rosenfield for bringing the Alchi fragment (Fig. 62) to my attention. 70 [58]</page><page sequence="59">Fig. 54 - Ropa, mChod rten on top of halo, clay Fig. 55 - Ta pho, mChod rten above Sarvavid figure (C.

Placed one each against the side walls are two standing Bodhisattva figures. The figures and their bases are made of wood. They are placed rather awkwardly on clay platforms which are lower than the platforms containing the clay Bodhisattvas. Further, as can be seen from the Vajrasattva (Fig. 57) to the right of the apse, they seem to have a provisionary relationship to the clay pedestal ? note the awkward size and the placement of Vajrasattva's pedestal which is precariously balanced on slabs of wood. The two standing wooden sculptures are c. 120 cm high, they are very similar in style and appear to have been sculpted by the same hand or at least workshop. To the left of the apse, Avalokitesvara (Fig. 58) can be recognized by the seated Buddha in the central piece of the tri-partite crown, and by the large lotus which is held in the left hand in abhayamudr?\ the right hand is in varadamudr?. The round face, full cheeks, pointed nose and pointed chin with small full mouth and large arched eyebrows, also the simple jewelry are typical features of Kashmiri art c. 8th-9th centuries (Fig. 59). But the crown, middle part pointed, side parts slightly rounded, placed on a band with side rosettes, the large hips with exaggerated thrust to one side are usually associated with a later period, perhaps the 10th century. Also typical of Kashmiri images ? although also found throughout Himachal Pradesh from Chamba to Spiti valley, is the dhoti with one leg much longer than the other, and the long flower m?l? that falls to the ankles. An unusual feature is the high piled hair that flows out of 72 [60]</page><page sequence="61">Fig. 59 - Ropa, detail of Avalokitesvara (C. Fig. 60 - Ropa, wooden Bodhisattva on a peacock Luczanits). (C. Luczanits). the tall crown and cascades down the back and shoulders in many small thin plaits. This same feature (in an even more exaggerated version) is found in two of the smaller wood statues. The question of the original provenance of these figures needs to be pursued, together with a careful analysis of the style and archaeological context of all the figures which is being prepared by Prof. Maurizio Taddei. The small wooden sculptures on the altar are also extremely interesting and they deserve a more thorough examination and photodocumentation than we could accomplish in the short time available to us. Stylistically, two of the figures can be related both to metal sculptures attributed to either Kashmir or Himachal Pradesh 10th-11th centuries, or to clay images in Ta pho and Lalung. A Bodhisattva figure seated in lalit?sana on a peacock is painted green with a yellow stomach (Fig. 60). It holds a m?l? in its right hand and the left hand rests on the left leg, palm turned downward, index finger curved and raised; the crown is large and tri-partite set on a band with rosettes over the ears. The hair falls down out of the crown in a rush of thin long plaits. The treatment of the torso, the rather flat profile and the shape of the head remind one of the carved wooden Manjusri above the entrance to the [61] 73</page><page sequence="62">Fig. 61 - Alchi, facade of 'Du khan (IsMEO, Tucci Archives).

Fortunately, this beautiful image was photographed by Ghersi when it was still in excellent condition (Fig. 61). Also belonging to this stylistic group is a beautiful wooden fragment preserved in the Fogg Museum, Harvard University, which was bought in Alchi in the 30's (Fig. 62). Most of the walls have mural paintings of a recent date, some (i.e. behind Avalokitesvara) are older but none seemed as ancient as the wooden sculptures. The entire wall surface needs to be examined with a good light. Ropa is important not only for the early dates of the several sculptures, but also because it conclusively demonstrates the intensive inter-regional artistic connections from the 10th-12th century throughout Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh. [62]</page><page sequence="63">Fig. 63 - Chini, Visnu temple (IsMEO, Tucci Archives, Neg. Dep. 6015/33; E. Ghersi). Chini During their 1933 visit Tucci and Ghersi photographed the most interesting Visnu temples in Chini. As this village lies along the old Tibet-Hindustan road quite high above the modern road which is closer to the Sutlej, we were unable to make the time consuming detour during our 1989 expedition. Today there are in fact three complexes: coming from the main road one arrives first at the modern administrative center Rekong Peo, above this is the old administrative center at Kalpa and next to this is the village of Chini (Fig. 63). Comparing the 1991 and 1933 photos one can see that the traditional wooden village is much reduced in size. The temples however appear to be all standing, indeed they have been so completely renovated and enlarged that we had difficulty in distinguishing the original structures and decoration in the short time available to us (Fig. 64). Hopefully the traditional temples here and in the former capital of the Bashar Rajas, Sarahan, will be properly documented before further renovation is carried out. ^ [63] 75</page><page sequence="64">Fig. 64 - Chini, Visnu temple in 1933 (IsMEO, Tucci Archives, Neg.

We have also attempted to document the art works of the later periods, up to the 18th century, as much as possible. However, we were also much impressed with the contemporary culture of the region. As we have noted, since the 1960's there has been a steady expansion of Tibetan Buddhist activity in Himachal Pradesh. Practically all the villages we visited had, within the last few years, initiated ambitious programs for religious buildings complete with new mural paintings sometimes, as in Poo, from artists brought from outside, but in Ta pho a modern school of thangka painting thrives once again. 76 [64]</page><page sequence="65">Fig. 65 - Ta pho, leags mkhar. We were fortunate fo be able to attend the Icags mkhar (iron castle in the form of a torma) (Fig. 65) ceremony at Ta pho, which consisted of three days of ritual preparation and two days of public ceremony held on Oct. 5th and 6th. This ceremony is held every four years (Fig. 66). Not only is this an important event in the life of the monastery but for the whole of the Spiti and upper Kunawar valleys. In addition to the important monastic rituals and 'cham dances which are meant to protect the monastery and the general environment, the two-day festival is also an occasion for the celebration of the local culture. Luczanits recorded all the music. He and Dr Kowar have catalogued it for the Phonogrammarchiv der Osterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. We keenly felt the continuity between the high level of artistic expression represented in the ancient monasteries and the living culture. Will local people and government officials be capable of safeguarding the local culture, despite the short term profits to be gained, now that the region will be open to tourists? Surely the flourishing painting school at Ta pho monastery conducted by the local painter bSod nams sTobs rgyas and his students, all from local villages, whose only inspiration has been the art remaining on the monastery walls, is proof of the importance and possibility of cultural continuity. The Icags mkhar ceremony and festival will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming Archive publication. [65] 77</page><page sequence="66">Fig. 66 - Ta pho, 'cham in 1933 (IsMEO, Tucci Archives, Neg. Dep. 6080/11; E. Ghersi). Concluding Remarks One of the most obvious conclusions to be drawn from our survey is the astonishing richness and diversity of the artistic culture of Himachal Pradesh from the 10th to 12th centuries which was not limited to Buddhism. Although we are only at the beginning of our study of this material several chronological phases are already apparent although not yet clearly definable. On the other hand, the cultural interrelationships ? that is the continuous sharing of a large, but consistent vocabulary of forms, throughout this region and period is also clear. The international and intra-regional trade network as well as shared religious and political institutions were undoubtedly responsible for this intensive cultural exchange. The change in style which seems to occur c. late 12th century may be the result of the emergence of Ladakh as the main political power during this period. As yet, Ta pho is still the only monastery in Himachal Pradesh whose wall paintings can be firmly dated to the 10th and 11th centuries. Sculptures from this period also survive at Gumrang, Udaipur, Lalung, Ropa among other sites. Due to the large amount of paintings and sculptures of often stunning artistic accomplishment as well as contem? poraneous inscriptions, which allows us to attribute the arts to the direct patronage of Ye ses 'od and Byah chub 'od, the Ta pho gTsug lag khan is a priceless historic document which provides a benchmark for the study of the other related arts of the region. 78 [66]</page><page sequence="67">The discovery of numerous painted manuscript folios from Ta pho, Poo and Lahul ? and their obvious relationship to the manuscript paintings recovered from mTho glih by Tucci and Ghersi, indicate the existence of prolific manuscript writing, copying, and illuminating centers in the 11th century. Further, these workshops must have been under some central control because of the uniformly high quality of the manuscripts until now discovered. Not only are the styles of the figures similar to each other but, interestingly, the calligraphy is also (26). The evidence for wide ranging teaching, translating and study at Ta pho suggests that Ta pho might have been one of the centers for manuscript production as well. The manuscript illuminations which we have discussed in this report are considered to have belonged to the 'Kashmiri' phase of painting in western Tibet. What this term 'Kashmiri' means is another question. Every scholar since Tucci has repeated his assertion (based on Rin chen bzah po's biography) that the mural and manuscript painting of western Tibet reflect the lost school of Kashmiri painting. However, no evidence of painting directly attributable to Kashmir has ever been found. Also there has never been any archaeological trace of a Buddhist monastery in Kashmir proper (i.e. the Srinagar valley) built after the 9th century (27). On the other hand, some painting from Alchi and Ta pho and also sculpture from Ta pho recalls stylistic elements and motifs found in sculpture from both Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. As we have seen, Kashmir was not the only center of artistic activity. We have abundant evidence for active artistic schools in all the neighboring regions as far as Chamba and Ladakh in the 10th century. And although we still have no examples of painting which might be understood as the forerunners of the 11th century western Tibetan style of painting, we do have evidence from the Gilgit manuscript covers for other local schools of painting prior to the 10th century. We have seen that the 11th century school of western Tibetan painting was far more extensive than previously expected, and this school had an independent character and a complex heritage. It is already clear that the western Tibetan painting in the 10th-12th century had different subdivisions, which point to different antecedents, none of which have as yet been identified. The contemporaneous artistic production was rich indeed. The sculptural arts also flourished ? not only large-size earthen sculptures and metal sculptures, but wood may have been the most commonly used medium. We have already noted a wide variety of functions ? from architectural decoration (Udaipur is the most spectacular surviving example), to shrines and votive st?pas. (26) Pal's conclusion that the leaves in the mTho glin manuscript belong to one manuscript because the writing is 'identical' is therefore certainly not correct. The slight differences in the size of the pages suggest three or perhaps four different manuscripts. (27) Naudou had confessed that he was unable to identify the location of Kashmiri monasteries listed in Tibetan colophons, but presumed they must have been in Srinagar. [67] 79</page><page sequence="68">In Ta pho we have already noted that the significance of the different stylistic groups within the second phase of painting and sculpture (early to mid 11th century) is not yet clear. We remain to a large degree in the archaeological phase of our study. That is, we are still attempting to thoroughly document and objectively analyse the artistic remains. Only tentatively have we begun to advance explanatory historical models. A major new aspect is a comparative study of the architecture. We have noted that there is a surprising degree of similarity with regard to the plans of the temples so far studied. We will soon be able to address the question of function. The question of the ritual function of the gTsug lag khan is paramount. In Ta pho we have the astonishing good fortune of a structure and its decoration, which has altered little, it seems, since the 11th century. One of the immediate goals of our inquiry is to understand how the gTsug lag khan was actually used, and by whom. Thanks to the multidisciplinary efforts of a number of scholars we are able to attempt to approach the evidence for the culture of the phyi dar in Himachal Pradesh from a number of methodological perspectives. The largest body of evidence remains the arts ? architecture, painting, sculpture. While the evidence is fragmentary in the extreme, it is our hope that from the puzzle of small fragments eventually a complete picture ? the arts in their historical context ? will emerge. 80 [68]</page><page sequence="69">REFERENCES Aryan, S.
