Eighteen sixty-nine, the year in which the Metaphysical Societyl was founded, also marked the beginning, roughly speaking, of the open at- tack from respectable quarters on traditional religion. For over a decade, this assembly of many of the best minds of the age convened in a re- markably genial atmosphere, which was fostered by a faithful adherence to the highest standards of courtesy in debate. Members refrained from flippancy and mockery, seldom came to grips with fundamental issues, and only rarely challenged the integrity of an opponent. When the So- ciety had finally run out of steam and voted its own extinction in 188o, the only common ground occupied by the members was their weariness of discussions that altered no one's views, their mutual respect for one another, and their deep concern with the fate of ethics in an age when Christianity was on the retreat. By 188o, public debates between believers and unbelievers, while they could still arouse great public interest, had ceased to shock. Unbelief had become respectable, and unbelievers faced their opponents (usually in periodicals) on an equal footing, and without fear of social ostracism. In an age which subscribed to the highest moral standards, de- bates on religious belief were conducted with a sense of urgency, for in many minds the survival of morality was directly related to the truth and 1 For an account of the history of the Metaphysical Society see A.

On the subject of conduct, all good men, believers and unbelievers alike, shared a common concern and a common set of values. Unbelievers willingly accepted the challenge and the burden of formu- lating a rational code of ethics that could inspire adherence without the aid of the supernatural. Believers warned that the bonds of society would disintegrate with the evaporation of religious sanctions. Thus the ques- tion of the truth of religion became difficult to separate from the ques- tion of the efficacy and social value of belief. Unbelievers, who were beyond reproach in their own conduct, nevertheless failed to arrive at a scientific theory of ethics that could win general acceptance even among themselves. On this thorny issue, they occasionally assailed one another with all the vehemence characteristic of their theological counterparts. The object of this study is to provide an insight into the religious climate of opinion of the mid-i88o's and into the character and varieties of unbelief and unbelievers, through an examination and analysis of an extended public controversy on the "religion of the future." The chief protagonists were Frederic Harrison and Herbert Spencer. In order to understand their response to religion, especially their different views on the nature of religious form and expression after Christianity had ex- pired and taken its place with other effete mythologies, it will be neces- sary to take into account their individual backgrounds and tempera- ments as well as their expressed, rationally-argued, philosophic positions. It may be said at once that they were alike, and not altogether typical of unbelievers of their age, in their adherence to universal systems (for Harrison, the Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte, and for Spencer, his own Synthetic Philosophy) and in their conviction that their respec- tive "scientific" philosophies would bring down the curtain on the long and futile battle between religion and science, and provide a rational solution to the problem of ethics in an age of unbelief. Despite the weight that each attached to the "scientific" character of his philosophy, they could hardly broach the question of religion without being swept away by their feelings. Neither had the emotional make-up of those agnostics who were content to suspend judgement. The controversy between Harrison and Spencer will offer us an exceptional opportunity to observe in action serious and strong-minded Victorian unbelievers who joined battle before the public not only on the scientific validity of their religious programs, but also on the effective- ness of those programs in motivating human action. It would seem, that in this prolonged controversy, Harrison and Spencer were less preoccu- pied with the niceties of their own arguments or the accurate compre- VICTORIAN STUDIES 34</page><page sequence="3">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER hension of an opponent's views than with making an impact on the minds of the spectators. We should look upon these Victorians, as they tended to look upon themselves, not merely as academic philosophers, but as crusaders and missionaries with philosophic systems designed to save mankind and set the world right. Unbelievers making pronouncements on the religion of the future were in danger of an onslaught both from their own camp and from that of their theological opponents. Harrison and Spencer were victims of what, at times, seemed almost like a joint attack of enemies who were on opposite ends of the religious spectrum. Among those who chose to become involved in this drama, albeit in minor roles, the most significant were James Fitzjames Stephen, a blunt sceptic with a Calvinistic view of human nature and an undisguised contempt for those unbelievers who persisted in clinging to the trappings of religion after they had dis- carded its essential core, and Wilfrid Ward, a brash, young (he was in his late twenties) Catholic apologist (son of the Tractarian convert to Catholicism, William George Ward) whose sentiments toward re- ligiously nostalgic unbelievers were not unlike Stephen's. Both were highly effective controversialists - piercing and merciless in their criti- cism and in their mockery. The spectacle of two unbelievers involved in religious warfare, while disconcerting to other unbelievers, who could not help being re- minded of the theological wrangles for which they had such contempt, was, however, an indication that unbelief (in the broadest sense of the term) had arrived. Both Harrison and Spencer conducted themselves like members of a new establishment, dismissing with impatience the protests of those whom progress seemed to be removing from the center of the stage of history. It is interesting to observe that the controversy on the religion of the future was conducted on all sides by and for laymen, though one hears on occasion the voice of a cleric. The problems of re- ligion and ethics were among the vital issues of the age, reaching deep into the hearts of men. The debate was no mere scholastic exercise to amuse intellectuals. It reflected the passions of the protagonists and the involvement, in spirit, of their audience. I Spencer's writings are, at present, generally held in such low esteem that one feels compelled to apologize for taking him seriously, SEPTEMBER 1968 35</page><page sequence="4">Sydney Eisen and to make some excuse for the generation that accorded him such princely recognition. A perusal of some of the chapters of his massive system will soon reveal the source of his spell. Spencer instinctively sensed the intellectual and moral dilemmas which were plaguing his con- temporaries. He formulated these problems clearly and eloquently, and he generally came up with a solution that was an appealing blend of common sense and scientific hypothesis. Like a skilled pedagogue, he knew when to recapitulate and underline. He amassed an immense body of factual information which in his day was often synonymous with scientific knowledge. But most important, he possessed remarkable powers of synthesis and simplification. Spencer, the prophet of evolu- tion, sought to encompass the behaviour of all phenomena within a single, grand, all-inclusive principle of rhythmic, relentless movement from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous to the homogeneous again - Evolution and Dissolution. He had introduced the first volume of his philosophic synthesis with a discourse on "the Unknowable," in which he attempted to effect a reconciliation between science and religion on the basis of "the deepest, widest, and most certain of all facts - that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable."2 Spen- cer strove to divest religion of anthropomorphism, and science of ar- rogance, in order to establish a mutual respect between them. His hopes that the theory of the Unknowable would shield his philosophy from charges of atheism and materialism were not fulfilled at the time (in the 186o's), though twenty years later, when religion was under heavy fire, the defenders of belief sometimes claimed him as an ally. Frederic Harrison was not as imposing a figure to his contempo- raries as Spencer, though he was more versatile and certainly more en- gaging.3 He was a barrister, labour reformer, historian, and man of let- ters. More important for our purpose, in the last three decades of the century he was the leading spokesman in England for the Positive Philos- ophy and Religion of Humanity of Auguste Comte. Though he never became one of Comte's complete disciples, he followed the master in his rejection of metaphysics as a foundation for philosophy. He accepted Comte's view of intellectual progress as formulated in the Law of the Three Stages (that all thought must proceed through three modes of explanation, the Theological, the Metaphysical, and the Positive or scientific) and his Classification of the Sciences (in the order that each 2 First Principles (London, 1862), p. 46. 3 I have given a sketch of Harrison's response to religion in "Frederic Harrison and the Religion of Humanity," South Atlantic Quarterly, LXVI (Autumn 1967), 574-590, and of Harrison's impact on Huxley in "Huxley and the Positivists," VS, VII (June 1964), 337-358.

Harrison also be- came converted to the Religion of Humanity (though he did not sub- scribe to the details of the dogma and structure as outlined by Comte). He regarded the "worship" of Humanity as a formal means of remem- bering and paying homage to those who had contributed to human progress. The purpose of worship was self-improvement; it was a means of ennobling the heart of the worshipper and directing his thoughts and actions to the service of man. Harrison's life was a reflection of his be- liefs. He championed unpopular causes, waging war on behalf of the legal rights of trade unions, decrying the evils of laissez faire, and ful- minating against the inhumanity of imperialism. For the last two dec- ades of the century he was the director of the Positivist organization at Newton Hall, off Fetter Lane, in London. A remarkably skillful writer and a zealous controversialist, he had no difficulty finding a platform for his views in the best journals of the day. Harrison had the deepest admiration for the author of the Syn- thetic Philosophy who, like Comte, had devoted himself to the cause of developing a scientific philosophic synthesis. Harrison and Spencer were also old friends; they met with some frequency and worked together on a number of occasions on behalf of Church disestablishment and interna- tional peace. While Harrison was a gregarious being, who moved happily and easily in many circles and who loved to engage in public debate, Spencer tended to be something of a recluse, especially in later years. A brief encounter with a friend, or the expression of a difference of opinion, would keep him awake at night and destroy his capacity for work. He therefore husbanded his energy by sheltering himself from outside dis- turbances and public involvements. He had refused to join the Meta- physical Society, of which Harrison was an early and enthusiastic mem- ber. Very few things upset him more than the accusation constantly levelled by Harrison, and occasionally by others less partial, that Spencer owed a major debt to Comte.4 Harrison also chided him for coming to rest in his views on religion with "the Unknowable," which Harrison dismissed as a negative, even a metaphysical, abstraction, devoid of the power to move the human heart or to inspire altruistic behaviour. He pointed out repeatedly that he and Spencer had much in common, but he insisted that the logic of Spencer's own argument must ultimately lead him to the Religion of Humanity. Spencer, on his part, took great pains to extricate himself from the Positivist embrace. It was an exasper- 4 I have discussed Spencer's reaction to Comte in "Herbert Spencer and the Spectre of Comte," Journal of British Studies, VII (Nov. 1967), 48-67. SEPTEMBER 1968 37</page><page sequence="6">Sydney Eisen ating and exhilarating experience for Spencer to cope with so skillful an opponent and one, moreover, who could challenge him as one unbeliever to another. Spencer seems to have been devoid of any religious feeling by the time he was a youth, and it is doubtful that he had ever been deeply moved by religion, even as a child. His parents were Wesleyans, and al- though his mother remained within the fold, his father broke away from the narrow discipline. On Sunday morning, Herbert attended the Quaker meeting house with his father, and in the evening the Methodist chapel with his mother. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Spencer did not have to wage war with his innermost feelings to free himself from the bonds of religion. As a young man he derived no spiritual satisfaction from worship; he could not tolerate commands to obedience; and he was repelled by Christian dogma and by the whole panoply of Christian practice. Thus we may conjecture that Spencer turned away emotionally from the religion of his childhood, even before scientific knowledge ob- literated any hold it might have had on his mind. He grew up without a sense of fear of punishment and without the need of religious comfort. Some aspects of religion thoroughly repelled him: "Owing to the foolish pertinacity with which, as a child, I was weekly surfeited with religious teaching and observances," he wrote to a friend in January 1856, "I have contracted a decided repugnance to the very form in which they were conveyed. I cannot hear scriptural expressions without experiencing a certain disagreeable feeling; and I can no more escape this than the nausea produced in me by particular sweets that were commonly given me after medicine when a child."5 Spencer, thus, was not a likely candi- date for conversion to the Religion of Humanity, which Huxley later characterized as "Catholicism minus Christianity." Spencer's original outline of his philosophic system, drawn up in January 1858, did not include the introductory section on the Unknow- able. It was only after he began preparing the first volume that he recog- nized the need for a preliminary statement on basic questions- "since, otherwise, I should be charged with propounding a purely materialistic interpretation of things."6 He expected that his readers would be grate- ful for his solution of an age-old conflict, and that once they had been won over to his theory of the Unknowable, they would then proceed 5 Letter to Mrs. Richard Potter quoted in David Duncan, Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer, 2 vols.

It has been suggested that Spencer's desire to reconcile science and religion was prompted by a need to appease his readers at a time when it was still difficult to find a respectable publisher for an outspoken rationalist viewpoint.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 38</page><page sequence="7">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER cheerfully to the main body of his philosophy. But the Unknowable did not provide a gate through which those with religious proclivities could pass easily on the way to the promised land; for Spencer had accom- plished the reconciliation of science and religion by stripping religion of theology, dogma, and personal communion with the Deity. Spencer's compromise gave little comfort to believers, and his views on the Per- sistence of Force, and Matter and Motion, left him open to the very charges of materialism and atheism which he had hoped to stave off. Harrison's upbringing and his early response to religion con- trasted sharply with Spencer's. He was born into a warm, pious house- hold with moderate High Church leanings. In his youth, during the Tractarian revolt, he gravitated towards ritualism. He remained a com- mitted Christian until his early twenties, when Positivism and the Re- ligion of Humanity slowly and imperceptibly eroded his orthodoxy. Throughout his life, he carried with him the most tender feelings for the emotional, aesthetic, and ethical qualities of Christianity. As a Posi- tivist, he considered religion the be-all and end-all of his existence, not something to be relegated to an introductory chapter in the manner of Spencer, in order to get on with the main business of philosophy. Harri- son conceived of "religion" as the unifying force in life, bringing into harmony thought, feeling, and action in the service of man. He firmly believed that the older faiths, tied to the false intellectual premises of Theology and Metaphysics, must inevitably give way to the "scientific" Religion of Humanity. Those outside the Positivist fold would have ranked him with the agnostics, yet he felt little kinship with the prevail- ing agnosticism of his day, for he prophesied that just as theology was effete and could no longer satisfy the human intellect, agnosticism was doomed to extinction because it could not prescribe a way of life or a course of action.7 Baiting agnostics in order to expose the weakness of their position became a favourite pastime with him, for it gave him the opportunity to demonstrate that he was in possession of a real, scientific, religion. It was part of Harrison's mission to defend the reputation of the much maligned founder of Positivism and to remind philosophers and men of science, especially Spencer, of their indebtedness to Comte. While most scientists refused to take the Positivists or Positivism seri- ously, Spencer, who was extremely touchy on the subject of intellectual indebtedness, passionately defended his own originality. Harrison, un- like Spencer, sought out a good fight, especially with a distinguished ad- versary. Equally adept at confounding believers and unbelievers, he 7 See his "Apologia pro Fide Mea, 1907," The Creed of a Layman (London, 1907), p. 7; also his Autobiographic Memoirs, 2 vols.

II The debate on the religion of the future may be divided into two distinct phases: the first, in 1884, centering on the intellectual issues themselves, and the second, in 1885, growing out of the republication, without Harrison's permission, of Spencer's and Harrison's essays in book form, along with additional material appended by Spencer and his American disciple, Dr. E. L. Youmans. The second phase affords us an opportunity to observe the behaviour of two high-minded Victorians, angry enough to give vent to their deepest feelings, and driven to their wits' end in a clash involving a gross breach of conduct. It was a splendid performance, though in the end propriety triumphed over candour. The first phase was initiated (probably unconsciously) by Spen- cer. In the latter part of 1883, the subject of religion was much on his mind as he was writing "Ecclesiastical Institutions," the last section (Part VI) of the Principles of Sociology. In the next to last chapter of Part VI, entitled "Ecclesiastical Retrospect and Prospect," he made a prediction that is striking: "Though with the transition from dog- matic theism to agnosticism, all observances implying the thought of propitiation may be expected to lapse; yet it does not follow that there will lapse all observances tending to keep alive a consciousness of the relation in which we stand to the Unknown Cause, and tending to give expression to the sentiments accompanying that consciousness."8 Musi- cal expression and preaching, predicted Spencer, would continue, and duty and conduct would henceforth form the substance and the end of religious teaching and observance. It is worth drawing particular atten- tion to these statements on religion not because this chapter was of direct significance in the controversy, but because it establishes that Spencer was at this time giving thought to the question of an agnostic religion, centered on the Ultimate Mystery as an object of reverence, and that he was even contemplating the survival of some traditional form of religious practice, as a vehicle for expressing religious sentiments that would continue to survive after traditional beliefs and doctrines had lost their hold. It was not this chapter, but the last one on "Ecclesiastical Institutions," that Spencer rushed into print as "Religion: A Retrospect 8 "Ecclesiastical Institutions" was first published separately in 1885.

VICTORIAN STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER and Prospect" in January 1884 (Nineteenth Century, XV, 1-12) because "the question was a burning one" on which he wished to be clearly under- stood.9 Almost at once, he found himself embroiled in a major battle.10 Applying the principle of Evolution to religion, Spencer calcu- lated that the integration of power among deities, which had proceeded from the beginning of time until it evolved into the idea of a single om- nipotent God, would result ultimately in the elimination of all anthropo- morphism, leaving as a residue only the belief in a Consciousness beyond human consciousness. Science does not destroy religion when religion is construed in terms of an Ultimate Mystery, but "enlarges the sphere of religious sentiment" (p. 11). The "Great Enigma" will continue to in- trigue men and to elicit explanations of the unexplainable. "But amid the mysteries which become the more mysterious the more they are thought about, there will remain the one absolute certainty, that he [man] is ever in the presence of an Infinite and Eternal Energy, from which all things proceed" (p. 12). Besides implying a rather unusual degree of familiarity with the Unknowable, these sentiments suggest that Spencer was thinking of enlarging rather than diminishing religious feeling and expression, even while eliminating the worship of a personal God. Curiously enough, before Harrison had uttered a word of criticism, the Spectator, on 5 January 1884, was already comparing Harrison's idea of religion (as expressed in his New Year's Address in Newton Hall) and Spencer's (as presented in his article) in order to damn both as a kind of "make-believe adoration" of objects with no power to move men (LVII, 9-1o). Spencer was both surprised and displeased when he learned from his friend Youmans that the American press had shown very little interest in his paper. In England there had been a considerable amount of comment. "There is, however, a marked absence of bitterness which characterized such notices in the years gone by," he consoled himself to Youmans." True, a number of clergymen terminated their subscrip- 9 Letters to Dr. E. L. Youmans, Spencer's American disciple, 13 and 17 Nov. 1883, quoted in Duncan, I, 337-338. The article also appeared in the Popular Science Monthly which was founded and edited by Youmans. James Knowles, the editor of the Nineteenth Century, had given in, in spite of his policy to the contrary, to Spencer's demand for simultaneous publication in the U.S.A. Of course, at this time, there was no way of pre- venting American publishers from reprinting such material, nor of compelling them to pay a royalty if they chose not to do so. 10 I shall take a chronological rather than a topical approach in discussing the controversy so that we may get a sense of the spirit of this unfolding drama. Various aspects of the debate will not be dealt with, except to the extent that they touch on the subject of the religion of the future. Spencer and Harrison fought with equal fervour about the origins of religion. 11 19 Jan. 1884, quoted in Duncan, I, 338. SEPTEMBER 1968 41</page><page sequence="10">Sydney Eisen tions to the Nineteenth Century, but we need not take this as an indi- cation of the attitude of the whole clerical world. There were some dis- tinctly favourable notices, and Canon H. G. Curteis in an article on "Christian Agnosticism," (NC, XV [Feb. 1884], 337-344) commended Spencer for taking a position that was both sound and honest, and one which was, moreover, a reasonable starting point on the road to faith.12 Spencer enjoyed being held up as a friend rather than a foe of religion. His equilibrium, however, was not destined to remain undisturbed for long. It was Harrison who set off the storm and added the bitterness that had hitherto been absent. His strategy was similar to that which he had employed so effectively against the authors of Essays and Reviews in "Neo-Christianity" (Westminster Review, LXXIV [Oct. 1860], 157- 178), his first important piece of writing. The essayists were devout Christians and honest intellectuals making a plea for the critical investi- gation of the sources of Christianity. Harrison argued that their own logic required that they give up their belief in Christianity altogether, since they had virtually rejected its supernatural basis. He had pushed the essayists further than they wished to go in order to destroy their case and bring them to the threshold of Positivism; and now he was ap- plying the same polemical technique to Spencer who, Harrison insisted, was propounding a new religion, with the Unknowable as its God. There was, to be sure, a modicum of truth in the charge, even though Harrison was deliberately distorting Spencer's position so that he could all the more easily turn his wit on the Unknowable and expose it as a mere bubble. In "The Ghost of Religion" (NC, XV [Mar. 1884], 494-506) Harri- son, after heaping lavish praise on Spencer for his great work in philoso- phy, gave him a lesson on the nature and purpose of the religion of the future. The new religion should not preoccupy itself with impossible questions about the universe, nor could it hope to accomplish anything worthwhile by standing in awe of the Unknowable, which, Harrison as- serted, was simply "the unknown." A real religion must concentrate on the knowable. Its aim must be to bring into harmony thought, feeling, and action, and to unite mankind. No power could accomplish this other than the Human Providence, to which we owe everything, and to which 12 Curteis pointed out that St. Paul had also spoken of the difficulty of fathoming the un- fathomable. He felt that Spencer's argument would inevitably lead from the Unknow- able toward a knowable Intelligent Being. He argued that the symbolic and aesthetic elements of Christian worship were essential for the masses. The Spectator was not pleased with what appeared to be a condescending attitude towards religion for ordinary people (LVII [9 Feb. 1884], 192-194). VICTORIAN STUDIES 42</page><page sequence="11">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER we can look with hope. Harrison made light of the Unknowable as a fountain of religious inspiration or action. Its only appropriate symbol, he gibed, would have to be "Xn": "But where two or three are gathered together to worship the Unknowable, there the algebraic formula may suffice to give form to their emotions: they may be heard to profess their unwearying belief in (xn), even if no weak brother with ritualist ten- dencies be heard to cry, 'O xn, love us, help us, make us one with thee!'" (p. 503). After castigating Spencer for failing to construct a viable and meaningful religion, Harrison then berated him for playing into the hands of the theologians who were using his arguments to prop up their own crumbling edifice. For Harrison, all intellectual roads led to Posi- tivism and the Religion of Humanity, and Spencer was urged to stop floundering about and to move with the current of history towards the inevitable goal. Two agnostics, arguing so passionately on religion, inevitably became objects of interest and amusement to believers and unbelievers alike. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, representing the latter, took both controversialists to task in "The Unknowable and the Unknown" (NC, XV [June 1884], 905-919). He could find no basis for a reconciliation be- tween science and religion and he could see no difference between Hu- manity with a capital "H" and the Unknowable with a capital "U" as objects of worship. Besides, man was an ugly beast and there was noth- ing in his history to inspire devotion. Oddly enough, Stephen did not conclude with a prophesy of doom; for he was not at all certain that man needed a religion: "We can get along very well without one, for though the view of life which science is opening up to us gives us nothing to worship, it gives us an infinite number of things to enjoy" (p. 917). But this was not an invitation to hedonism either. Stephen acknowledged that religion was a beautiful and a powerful moral agent; unfortunately it was not true. He did not foresee a decline in morality with a decline in religious belief: "Ubi homines, ibi mores" (p. 918). Decent people would keep society going very much in the same way; and, as for the ugly beast, the law and the threat of punishment would keep it in check. From the opposite end of the field, in full battle dress, charged Wilfrid Ward, armed with a devastating sense of humour which ex- ceeded the bounds of polemical propriety. In the opening paragraph of the "Clothes of Religion" (National Review, III [June 1884], 555-573), he told a story that was intended to convey the impression that on the subject of religion, Spencer and Harrison, two normally sane individuals, were quite mad. Like Stephen he expressed his sympathy with Harri- son's criticism of Spencer; then he joined Stephen in an attack on both: SEPTEMBER 1968 43</page><page sequence="12">Sydney Eisen "The truth seems to be that these philosophers having conspired together to kill all real religion ... and having, as they supposed, accomplished their work of destruction and put religion to death, have proceeded to divide its clothes between them. By the clothes of religion I mean those ideas and corresponding emotions with which we invested the objects of religious faith" (p. 560). These clothes, he continued, fit shabbily both on the Unknowable and on Humanity because the substance of religion - belief in a real personal God accessible to men - is utterly lacking. On seeing Harrison's "Ghost of Religion," Spencer realized that he had been showered with compliments only to be buried beneath them, and that Harrison had stood on the heap in order to raise aloft the tablets of a Religion of Humanity. Even for a philosopher who offi- cially shunned public debate, a rebuttal was essential.13 Spencer's "Retro- gressive Religion" (NC, XVI [July 1884], 3-26) covered much more ground than was necessary for the immediate defense of his position. He attacked every aspect of the Positive Philosophy, belittled Comte (especially for his anti-evolutionism) and ridiculed the Religion of Hu- manity. Spencer was too much of a misanthrope to grasp the meaning of Harrison's concept of the worship of Humanity, let alone adopt the prac- tice. In the early stages of human development, asserted Spencer, self- ishness rather than altruism spurred human progress, and now, de- spite the advances in civilization, man's failings are all too apparent. Spencer's confidence in the Unknowable was not shaken; he proclaimed that if veneration was to be offered at all, it was due "to that Ultimate Cause from which Humanity, individually and as a whole, in common with all other things, has proceeded" (pp. 22, 24). In attempting to meet Harrison on his own ground, Spencer was adding attributes to the Un- knowable which could only lend substance to Harrison's charge that he was, in fact, trying to found a new religion. Spencer's invective and his levity would have been sufficient to bring Harrison back into the arena, had he needed any encouragement. An extra fillip was added by the support Spencer was receiving from 13 Spencer was less reluctant to join battle than his public utterances would indicate. He had long been waiting for an opening to demolish the Religion of Humanity: "As I think I told you," he wrote to Youmans, "I intended years ago to do this, and it was to form part of an article on 'Religion: a Retrospect and Prospect,' which I have published. But . . . I thought on the whole it might be well not to arouse the animosity of the Positivists. Now, however, that Harrison's article practically challenges me, I feel very much inclined to have my say in the matter" (6 Mar. 1884, quoted in Duncan, I, 336-338). Spencer's reply to Harrison was pretty well complete before he read Stephen's article, and he was acquainted with Ward's only through a reference in the Saturday Review. This would explain why Spencer did not deal with Stephen and Ward in his rebuttal. VICTORIAN STUDIES 44</page><page sequence="13">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER religious quarters. In "Agnostic Metaphysics" (NC, XVI [Sept. 1884], 353-378), Harrison solemnly reminded him of his warning, issued ten years before, to the effect that the philosophy of the Unknowable was bound to land Spencer in the dubious company of theologians.14 Harri- son now pointed out that Spencer had begun, in the course of the con- troversy, to expatiate on the attributes of the Unknowable in a manner that implied that he had become much better acquainted with this Phenomenon since the writing of First Principles. How could Spencer know so much about the Unknowable, asked Harrison in half a dozen different ways in order to drive home his point. Harrison's response was much more effective in humbling the Unknowable than in exalting the Religion of Humanity. Yet he took great pains to make an appealing case for the new form of worship. In order to bring his critics within the ambit of the Religion of Human- ity, he redefined it in terms so vague and innocuous that his new position could logically be construed as a retreat from Positivism, if not a rejec- tion of Comte. He asserted that the worship of Humanity involved noth- ing more than the acceptance of one's obligations to mankind on prin- ciples that were human and not theological; the worship itself was a form of appreciation, which was nothing other than an extension of the affection one feels for one's parents; perfection was no more imputed to Humanity than to parents; the aim of the Religion of Humanity was nothing other than a deepening and broadening of altruism until it would embrace all mankind past, present, and future; Humanity with a capital "H" was not a god, and Harrison was willing to drop the capital in order to mollify his opponents. Harrison would not allow himself to believe that either Spencer or Stephen, whom he knew personally as generous men, were giving vent to their true feelings about mankind when they expounded on human selfishness. Such views he warned - and here was the ultimate threat for both Victorian believers and unbe- lievers alike- would "strike at the root of morality and all estimate whatever of human greatness and merit" (p. 375); they would also undermine patriotism and family devotion. That was sufficient reason for Harrison to reject them out of hand: "All healthy morality as well as all sound philosophy, show us that the sum total of all this mass of life is good, and is tending towards better" (p. 375). The use of the 14 Spencer was amused and pleased by this support (letter to Youmans, 22 July 1884, quoted in Duncan, I, 330-331). Harrison had said in 1874 that he regretted the use of the Unknowable as a means of solving the religious problem: "To do this ... is to reopen the whole range of Metaphysics . . . and the whole apparatus of Theology will follow through the breach" ("Mr. Lewes's Problems of Life and Mind," Fortnightly Review, XVI [July 1874], lo1). SEPTEMBER 1968 45</page><page sequence="14">Sydney Eisen words "healthy," "sound," "good," and "better" speak eloquently for Harrison's world view. Harrison was begging the questions raised by Stephen; by using the threat that a cynical assessment of human nature would impede life and progress, he hoped to bring his opponents to their senses. In the course of defending the Positive Philosophy and the Reli- gion of Humanity, Harrison got carried away; and, in replying to Spen- cer, he seems to have forgotten that he was expected only to unhorse his opponent and not slay him. In their debate on the origins of religious belief, Spencer (who postulated a ghost-theory, i.e., that first notions of the supernatural came from dreams, against Comte's theory of fetishism) had referred Harrison to his Descriptive Sociology where Spencer, with the help of a number of assistants, had classified a mass of information on the customs and manners of about eighty different peoples.15 Harri- son, in the heat of the argument, referred to this work as "a huge pile of cuttings from various travellers of all classes, extracted by three gentle- men whom Mr. Spencer had employed" (p. 363); thus he could not be expected to change his views on the origin of religious belief "on the strength of a pile of clippings made to order" (p. 364). And if these in- sinuations were not enough to knock Spencer's delicate constitution out of kilter, Harrison urged once again that Spencer familiarize himself with Comte "all the more as he owes to him so much indirectly through others" (p. 365). Harrison could hardly have expected to strengthen his case by losing his temper and imputing both dishonesty and unac- knowledged borrowing from Comte to his eminent opponent. The treatment Harrison meted out to Ward was even less re- strained.16 The reply to Ward was made in a "Postscript"-a single paragraph in small print following the signature at the end of the article: "I do not find that Mr. Ward has added much to the controversy except the rather mess-room remark that Mr. Spencer and myself are both mad. I am the less called on to examine his views, inasmuch as his own religious standpoint, I believe, is Catholicism in its most Ultramontane form - the Syllabus of the Papacy. But in whatever form he may care to present it, Catholicism is not, in my opinion, within the field of serious religious philosophy. And, if the thinking world is not yet ready to accept 15 Descriptive Sociology (London, 1873-1934). The first eight parts were published dur- ing Spencer's lifetime. The pressure of time and the lack of funds forced him to suspend publication in 1881. The remaining portions (parts 9-19) were published after his death. 16 Stephen came off rather well. Harrison hailed him as an ally, for Stephen had said that in the future the standard of conduct must be set by men (p. 378). Harrison how- ever, in fine theological fashion, denied that the masses could get along without religion, as Stephen had proposed. VICTORIAN STUDIES 46</page><page sequence="15">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER mine, it has long ago decided to reject his." As for the power of Humanity to give solace and hope: "If it is not the comfort offered by promises of ecstatic bliss and supernatural intervention, it has the merit of being true and humane; not egoist and untrue" (p. 378, italics mine). Harrison's intemperate language is all the more startling, because we know him to have had a very deep respect for Catholicism. Ward replied with a piece called "A Pickwickian Positivist" (NR, IV [Oct. 1884], 222- 237), in which he accused Harrison of reviving the odium theologicum and of surrendering "the essential features of Positivist Worship and religion in all that distinguishes it from mere philanthropy" (p. 222).17 Ward was obviously piqued; however, a warm letter from Cardinal New- man, complimenting him on his articles on Positivism, probably made up in some degree for the snubs and insults that he had suffered at the hands of Harrison.18 Harrison's store of wrath was not yet exhausted, and he now took his quarrel with Spencer from the periodicals to the newspapers. He also diverted its focus from the religion of the future to the question of Spencer's originality and his debt to Comte. He threw down the gaunt- let in an address delivered in Newton Hall on 5 September, the anniver- sary of Comte's death, in which he referred to Spencer as "in all essen- tials ... [Comte's] unconscious imitator.... Had there been no Comte assuredly there would have been no Spencer." The address was sent to The Times and the Standard, where it was reprinted at length. A hot exchange between Spencer and Harrison followed in both papers.19 Despite Spencer's usual public protests that he had no wish to be drawn into battle, he was rather pleased with the opportunity Harrison had given him to present to a wider public his views of the origin of the Synthetic Philosophy, and to be able to disclaim any predecessors what- soever.20 One cannot help wondering how much benefit the readers of 17 This view had already been expressed in a number of journals, e.g. the Spectator, LVII (6 Sept. 1884), 1178-1179, and the Saturday Review, LVIII (6 Sept. 1884), 308-309. 18 Quoted in Wilfrid Ward, Witnesses to the Unseen and Other Essays (London, 1893), p. xxix, n.l. 19 The Times, 6 Sept. 1884, p. lo (Harrison's address); 6 Sept., p. 9 (leader on Har- rison's address); 9 Sept., p. 5 (Spencer's letter); 12 Sept., p. 8 (Harrison); 15 Sept., p. 7 (Spencer); 17 Sept., p. lo (Harrison). The dates for the letters in the Standard are the same. In his last letter Harrison proclaims that he has the highest regard for Spencer and that he does not wish to attack him in the name of Comte, but to reconcile the two. 20 Letter to Youmans, 9 Sept. 1884, quoted in Duncan, I, 342. Spencer sent Youmans his letters to The Times of 9 and 12 Sept., suggesting that Youmans might find some use for them. Spencer's hint was Youmans' command, and the letters appeared in the Popu- lar Science Monthly, XXVI (Nov. 1884), 39-40, along with an editorial comment, 125- 126. By October Spencer was complaining of the drain on his time and was very anxious to bring the affair to a close (letters to Youmans, 15 Sept., 6 and 30 Oct. 1884, quoted in Duncan, I, 342-344). SEPTEMBER 1968 47</page><page sequence="16">Sydney Eisen these newspapers derived from the long, involved, and sometimes highly technical arguments on the relationship of Spencer's philosophy to Comte's.21 Spencer was naive enough to believe that just a few more pages of print could bring order into this tangled affair. He was, however, sur- prisingly perceptive in recognizing the signs of weariness on the part of the public. "Last Words About Agnosticism and the Religion of Hu- manity" (NC, XVI [Nov. 1884], 826-839), was a rather feeble retort to "Agnostic Metaphysics." Harrison's insults, distortions, and misquota- tions were all pointed up. But just as Harrison had watered down the worship of Humanity, Spencer now insisted that he had never proposed making the Unknowable the object of religious emotion; he had not contemplated the establishment of a cult, nor had he claimed that the Unknowable could do all the things that Harrison said it could not do (pp. 832-833). Harrison replied through a letter in the Pall Mall Gazette (18 Nov. 1884 ),22 that he would not answer what he believed was a new challenge from Spencer, for he too had become aware that "the public has had enough" and that he and Spencer were beginning to appear like scrapping children. Perhaps he was also becoming con- cerned with the effect of his words on Spencer's health and spirits. "Some ladies of our acquaintance," he wrote to Pierre Laffitte, the Director of the Positivist movement in Paris, "in whose home Spencer was living during our struggle begged me not to reply to him; Spencer was so violently upset and angry that they feared he would commit suicide."23 For that reason, added Harrison, he had taken to showering him with compliments. The debate on the religion of the future (if not the wrangle on Spencer's debt to Comte) seems to have aroused considerable comment and interest. The Saturday Review had noted in early June that the public was being treated to a "controversy of an unusually picturesque and gratifying kind, upon the matter of the greatest possible interest to everybody" (LVII [7 June 1884], 747-748). As one would expect, both Positivists and Spencerians were deeply agitated because they tended 21 The Saturday Review, somewhat puzzled by all the fuss, put this quarrel in the same newsworthy category as "the giant gooseberry and the shower of frogs." The writer accused The Times of cynically trying to work up some reader interest during a dull season: "An eager public has, we doubt not, been hanging on the utterances of the two philosophic gladiators, and awaiting breathlessly the determination of the question as to how much an English thinker with whose thoughts the majority of them trouble themselves very little owes to a French philosopher with whom they have no acquaint- ance at all" (LVIII [20 Sept. 1884], 361-362). 22 Reprinted in The Nature and Reality of Religion: A Controversy Between Frederic Harrison and Herbert Spencer, ed.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 48</page><page sequence="17">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER to see the affair as a war between two philosophic systems, rather than simply a clash between two views on religion. Portions of the debate and the exchange of letters were reprinted by Laffitte in France and by Youmans in America, each adding highly slanted editorials in favour of his champion.24 A writer in the Contemporary Review commented that this discussion, "intended to influence the minds of laymen," was "the most valuable contribution to the Great Debate... since the posthumous publication of John Stuart Mills 'Three Essays on Religion.' "25 Curi- ously enough, the second phase of the controversy, concerning what Harrison later called "literary piracy," seems to have aroused even more excitement than the debate on the religion of the future, even though it had little intellectual content or significance. A full-scale battle between Harrison and Spencer on this moral issue stirred the minds of contem- porary Englishmen, according to the writer for the Contemporary Re- view, to "an unwonted degree" at a time "when beyond all the experience of our generation the British Empire was surrounded by difficulties, even amid Ministerial crises - in the very moment of preparation for a Gen- eral Election" (p. 200). What higher tribute could one offer? III Youmans instigated the republication, without Harrison's consent, of the articles of the controversy in book form. In early 1885 he informed Spencer that there was a wide demand in America for the publication, and that Appleton, Spencer's American publisher, was ready to under- take it.26 Youmans urged that it was necessary to act at once, in order to forestall other publishers. He also warned that publication by another source would give the impression that the Spencerians in America were not confident of their position. "The Comtists are reviving," he added, 24 Youmans spoke of the "profound importance" of the issue for the relationship between science and religion. For republications and Youmans' comments see Popular Science Monthly, XXIV (Jan. 1884), 340-351; XXV (Aug. 1884), 440-474; XXVI (Nov. 1884), 39-40, (Jan. 1885), 299-323, 407-409. Laffitte commented on the controversy in his 37th Annual Circular (Paris, Jan. 1885), p. 14. Laffitte had no doubt that Spencer was only a poor imitator of Comte. In the next Circular (Jan. 1886), he noted that it was necessary to reprint some of the material "pour miner, surtout en France, une influence philosophique qui a ete vraiment d6sastreuse en s'interposant entre le positivisme et une partie de nos classes cultiv6es" (p. 4).

SEPTEMBER 1968 49</page><page sequence="18">Sydney Eisen striking a dramatic note, "Harrison is coming over to lecture in this country, and much will be made of his brilliant conduct of the contro- versy."27 Spencer swallowed the bait; he sought no corroborating evi- dence either of the Comtist revival (which takes us by surprise), or of Harrison's visit to America (which took Harrison by surprise), or of any other publisher's interest in the debate. Without notifying Harrison, he immediately consented to the reprinting, and soon sent off some notes to be added to Harrison's articles for the purpose of correcting "mis- statements" about his own position. Youmans was given carte blanche to alter the notes and was asked in addition to explain in a preface that the publication of the book was in response to public demand and not Spencer's idea. This slight uneasiness on Spencer's part should not be taken as a sign of an inner sense of guilt, for no man with any guile would have left himself so defenceless before his enemies. Only Spen- cer's obsession with the worth of his ideas, his gullibility in dealing with disciples, and his extraordinary capacity to fool himself, can account for his baffling behaviour. The Nature and Reality of Religion: A Controversy Between Frederic Harrison and Herbert Spencer appeared in the spring of 1885.28 The preface, summarizing the views of Spencer and Harrison in the controversy, and the notes, initialled E. L. Y., were all added in support of Spencer's position and at Harrison's expense. Youmans appended an article written by Count Goblet d'Alviella, Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Brussels, who strongly supported Spencer's stand. Youmans also included a short synopsis of the major principles of the Synthetic Philosophy and a piece from a London newspaper describ- ing, in ludicrous terms, a religious service in Richard Congreve's Church of Humanity.29 Altogether it was a brazen and unscrupulous job of edit- ing, and it is astonishing that Spencer, on seeing the final product, did not disown it at once. Harrison was beside himself when he received a copy of the book. A curt letter (26 May 1885) to Spencer asked for clarification. Spencer's reply (27 May) was an accurate account of the events that had led to the republication. He was not at all contrite, and his tone had a ring of confidence. In a peroration that would have bewildered any judge and 27 Letter from Youmans, 2 Jan. 1885, and Spencer's replies, 14 and 15 Jan., quoted in Duncan, I, 346-348. 28 The "Preface," dated February 1885, was initialled "E. L. Y." The full title includes "With an Introduction, Notes and Appendix on the Religious Value of the Unknowable by Count D'Alviella." 29 This malicious piece of writing was intended to reflect on Harrison by drawing atten- tion to the absurdities of the Religion of Humanity. Congreve had been Harrison's tutor at Oxford, and had led the way in forming a Positivist movement in England. Harrison, unable to tolerate Congreve's dogmatism and his literal acceptance of Comte's views on religion, had broken with him in 1879. VICTORIAN STUDIES 50</page><page sequence="19">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER jury, he exclaimed: "Do you think I was not justified in this course? Do you think I ought to have withheld my consent to the republication by my friends, leaving your friends to republish? Do you think that having assented to republication, I ought to have let pass without cor- rections your misstatements previously uncorrected? If you think either of these things, I imagine few will agree with you."30 Spencer, however, had no desire to gain an unfair advantage; he at once suggested that the book be reissued in England with comments added by Harrison. Harrison came back with a blistering attack, published in The Times, in which he branded the book as "a new and most unworthy form of literary piracy."31 Then in a fit of temper, he punctured his own air- tight case by demanding an account of the profits that would accrue from the sale of the book, thus conveying the impression that personal gain was a factor in Spencer's consent to republication. After a bitter exchange through a series of letters to newspapers, the plates and stock of the book were destroyed by Appleton at Spencer's request. Before it was all over, Harrison had apologized profusely and repeatedly for rais- ing the question of remuneration.32 Harrison's affection for Spencer and his concern for his health were perfectly genuine, as was his constant pleading for a resumption of their friendly relations. Thus it was Harrison, rather than Spencer, who was asking to be forgiven. But Harrison, as Spencer realized, was not even aware of how deeply he had hurt his friend. It was the deroga- tory comments on the compilation of the Descriptive Sociology that Spencer felt most acutely. In a long letter to Harrison, Spencer outlined the history of the work which had involved him in a vast expenditure of time, labour, and funds. As for their personal relations, he added: "The recent incident has of course not tended to further the healing, and you can hardly suppose that I can forthwith establish anything like cordial relations with one who has inflicted on me immeasurably more pain than has been inflicted by any other man. But I will do my best." If Harrison did not shed any tears, he at once set out to make amends. He had, he insisted, no intention of conveying the impression that Spen- 30 Harrison to Spencer, 26 May 1885; Spencer to Harrison, 27 May; Harrison MSS (The British Library of Economic Science, London).

He only objected to "the philosophic method of proof' employed in the work; and he still felt compelled to say that it was not one of Spencer's outstanding con- tributions.33 Thus, when calmness returned, so did more measured and tactful words. The affair was not quite over. Still to come were letters to The Times from Harrison (7 October 1885) on his refusal to accept a royalty cheque from Appleton, and from Youmans (16 November 1885) in a self-righteous defence of his and Appleton's course of action in the ab- sence of an international copyright agreement.34 Before the end of the year another American publisher had brought out a new edition of the controversy, the editor of which was altogether hysterical in her adula- tion of Spencer and in her condemnation of Harrison.35 Spencer and Harrison, however, refrained from any further provocation, for neither wished to fan the smouldering embers. It would not be inappropriate to bring down the curtain on this over-lengthy drama with Harrison extending his hand in friendship and Spencer, albeit reluctantly, about to grasp it. IV It is not altogether surprising that, with the passage of time and the healing of wounds, the similarities in the religious and ethical out- look of Harrison and Spencer became more evident than the differences. 33 Letter to Harrison, 13 June 1885, Harrison MSS, quoted in Duncan, I, 352; Harrison's reply, n.d., is quoted in Duncan, I, 353. 34 7 Oct. 1885, p. 8, and 16 Nov., p. 13.

Gail Hamilton pseud. (S. E. Cassino and Company: Boston, 1885). Mary Abigail Dodge (born in Hamilton, Mass.) was a journalist of considerable reputation. Her reissue of the debate, along with letters on copyright from The Times and the Standard, was prompted by the conviction that the American people had a right to have this very important book available, deplorable as the copyright laws may be. She compared "St. Herbert" with "St. Paul," and she had little use for narrow-minded theologians who quarrelled with the Philosopher who "has given Theology firm standing-ground in science" (p. 171). In proclaiming that there was no difference be- tween Spencer's Eternal Energy and the God of the Hebrews, she confirmed Harri- son's prophecy of 1874 (n. 14). Harrison was castigated as "a reckless logician" (p. 193) and ridiculed as a "pampered, saucy, lively little poodle" who had been fool- hardy enough to challenge "a big sedate Scottish collie" (p. 193). We do not know how Spencer and Harrison received the volume, though there is some indication that Spen- cer was not altogether displeased. In an undated letter, written sometime between September 1890 and March 1891, Miss Dodge noted the following: "I have Herbert Spencer's new book, 'From the Author,' if you please! 'Social Statics,' " (Gail Hamil- ton's Life and Letters, ed. H. Augusta Dodge, 2 vols. [Boston, 1901], II, ioi8). VICTORIAN STUDIES 52</page><page sequence="21">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER Harrison put high value on his friendship with Spencer; and he show- ered him with praise in public and in private. Spencer, who in old age found himself in a world increasingly hostile to many of his cherished views, derived comfort from Harrison's esteem and affection. He did not waver on the originality of his philosophy, nor did he become a con- vert to the Religion of Humanity. But he did examine Harrison's and Comte's religious views in a fresh light, and there are indications that he was becoming more favourably disposed to some form of a religion of humanity (if not the Religion of Humanity), though he preferred to think of it as "ethics" rather than "religion."36 In the early 'nineties Spencer discovered for himself, as if the idea were altogether new, that he and Harrison were thinking along the same lines on certain fundamental issues. On reading an article by Har- rison in December 1892, he was "startled" by the "degree of agreement between your views and my own concerning certain ultimate ques- tions."37 Spencer was at the time completing his Principles of Ethics. In a sickly and weakened condition, he was making notes for the con- cluding chapter of his work, when he was struck by a passage in an article by Harrison, in which he defined the service of Humanity as a higher sense of duty transcending family and country.38 In order to im- press upon Harrison the measure of agreement and to forestall any charges of plagiarism, Spencer reproduced and sent to him three sen- tences from his notes: A transfigured sentiment of parenthood which regards with solicitude not child &amp; grandchild only, but the generations to come hereafter - fathers of the future creat- ing &amp; providing for their remote children. ... May we not say that the highest ambi- tion of the truly beneficent will be to have a share - even but an infinitesimal share - in the making of man.... While contemplating from the heights of thought that far-off life of humanity never to be enjoyed by them, but only by a remote posterity, they will feel a calm pleasure in the consciousness of having aided by conduct or by teaching the advance towards it.39 Harrison must surely have been puzzled as well as pleased, for he had expressed these sentiments on numerous occasions in his writings on the Religion of Humanity, and especially in the debate with Spencer on the religion of the future. Spencer explained in the letter that he regarded these sentiments as "belonging to Ethics," while Harrison thought of 36 A modern writer notes that this was not an uncommon fate for unbelievers: "It is in something like this 'Religion of Humanity', broadly conceived, that probably the major- ity of nineteenth-century sceptics found their home" (Franklin L. Baumer, Religion and the Rise of Scepticism [New York, 1960], p. 166). 37 Letter to Harrison, 4 Dec. 1892, Harrison MSS, also quoted in Duncan, II, 18-20. 38 "Mr. Huxley's Ironicon," Fortnightly Review, LII (1889), 716. 39 Letter to Harrison, 4 Dec. 1892. SEPTEMBER 1968 53</page><page sequence="22">Sydney Eisen them as "belonging to religion - a word which I reserve for another purpose," namely "a belief in a Power as unknown and transcending knowledge. As I say, the difference is after all very much a difference of names, save, indeed, that while I consider that there will be a per- sistent recognition of this unknown power, you apparently do not think the recognition will continue." There was enough fuel in these remarks to have produced an explosion in the mid-'eighties, but the time for such explosions was past. Harrison greeted Spencer's acknowledgement of agreement as a welcome and unexpected concession, to which he made reference on numerous occasions.40 He did not challenge Spencer's dis- torted summary of their differences, nor did he inform him, as he might have, that the source of the sentiments expressed in the notes might very well have been his own writings.41 V Among the advantages of historical perspective is the ability to assess and compare, with a degree of objectivity, assumptions, argu- ments, and entreaties of men of another age who, swept up in the cur- rent of contemporary controversy, viewed one another as antagonists. From the vantage point of a later era, they may begin to look very much alike, as do Harrison and Spencer. Yet, the student of history must also immerse himself in the past to the extent that sharp differences which provoked anger and conflict assume again the clarity and intensity which once characterized them. It is also essential to try to visualize the particular circumstances out of which these divergent views and con- flicts arose. Harrison's and Spencer's clash on the religion of the future had roots that go much deeper than the arguments which they posed. Harri- son's High Anglican background, his pleasant home and warm relation- ship with his parents, his Oxford education, his literary and artistic 40 "Herbert Spencer writes to me to say that I have convinced him that the differences between us on Ethics are more a matter of language than of meaning" (Harrison to an unknown source, 30 Dec. 1892, Laffitte MSS; Harrison, "Spencer's 'Life,' " Positivist Review, XVI [July 1908], 148-149). Harrison was surely indulging in wishful think- ing when he added that Spencer ultimately settled down to "what was practically Faith in Humanity and the Service of Man." 41 There is of course no way of proving this. Spencer in a later letter to Harrison made some interesting comments on the source of his knowledge. After admitting that he seldom consulted the works of others, he noted: "I met somewhere with the remark made by Lewes to Fiske that I must have absorbed knowledge through the skin" (21 Nov. 1901, Harrison MSS). It would not be unfair to suggest that osmosis was also at work in this instance. VICTORIAN STUDIES 54</page><page sequence="23">FREDERIC HARRISON AND HERBERT SPENCER interests, are significant in throwing light on his stand on religion. Emo- tionally, he never broke his ties with his past, and even after he had ceased to believe, he maintained his love for ritual and his respect for the priesthood as a moral force. Thus he was ideally suited for the Reli- gion of Humanity, and he played a semi-priestly role as the leader of the major Positivist organization in England. He did not subscribe to the Positive Philosophy and Religion of Humanity in all its details, but as a follower of Comte he had a strong sense of community and was suspi- cious of excessive individualism. "Order and Progress" was the Positivist motto, and progress meant the growth of altruism over egoism, and cooperation over competition, through the worship of Humanity. Spencer remained at heart an individualist, fearful and resentful of authority. His experience with religion as a youth made repugnant any further association with theological dogmas and creeds; and he rejoiced in his release. His Wesleyan-Quaker background asserted itself in his repect for nonconformists and his antipathy for priestly castes and rituals. Rebellious in his youth and a bachelor throughout his life, he shrank from personal commitments that restrained his freedom. Self- educated, proud, and easily hurt, he became thoroughly upset at the suggestion that he was intellectually indebted to others and absolutely enraged when he was accused of having derived some of his major philosophic illuminations from Comte. Thus Harrison's public invita- tion to Spencer to acknowledge his debt to Comte and to embrace the Religion of Humanity nearly unhinged him at times. Spencer was willing to acknowledge the Mystery behind all phe- nomena and to admit that men in the future would continue to express their awe and reverence in the face of that Mystery, but he was far too hard-headed and unsentimental to worship Humanity which, alas, was no mystery to him. Convinced that rebellion against priests was the hallmark of a progressive society, he recoiled from the prospect of a new priesthood, even a priesthood of philosophers ministering to a "scien- tific" religion. Spencer visualized the religion of the future as an outward expression of man's acknowledgement of a Mystery; he did not foresee religion playing a predominant role, even though it would continue to exist and the orientation of its ministers would be increasingly ethical. Harrison viewed religion as a social necessity; as the world passed through the stages of Theology and Metaphysics it was essential that a "scientific" religion take the place of the old cults, for religion was the source of morality, and the true religion (i.e., the worship of Humanity) was the necessary inspiration for good conduct and human progress. Unlike Spencer, who dealt in an off-hand manner with the religion of SEPTEMBER 1968 55</page><page sequence="24">Sydney Eisen the future, Harrison subscribed to a full-blown secular religion and de- voted much of his life to its propagation. While the debate was a natural outgrowth of genuine tem- peramental, environmental, and philosophical differences, it neverthe- less produced a distorting effect on the religious principles of both pro- tagonists. In order to render the much maligned Religion of Humanity more palatable to his contemporaries, Harrison "decapitalized" Human- ity and reduced the concept to an extended form of parental affection and patriotism; while Spencer, wounded by ridicule for raising aloft as an object of reverence a mere emptiness, puffed up the Unknowable with attributes which brought it dangerously close to the anthropomor- phic Deity he had rejected. Both realized that they had been forced into false positions and were anxious to be allowed to retreat to firmer ground. On the all-important question of ethics there was no way of assessing the relative power of either the Unknowable or Humanity, and a chorus of sceptics and Christians made light of the efficacy of both. For all his respect for religion, Harrison, because he dismissed as useless all meta- physical deliberations, found less sympathy among believers than Spen- cer, who at least left open the continued possibility of a dialogue. The controversy on the religion of the future excited public interest because it raised questions and expressed concerns which were common to the age. We may hasten to add, however, that neither the reading public nor the masses flocked to embrace either the Religion of the Unknow- able or the Religion of Humanity.
