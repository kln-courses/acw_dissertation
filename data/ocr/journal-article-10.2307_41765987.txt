Obstacles to un- derstanding the uses and meanings of body imagery, however, are especially frustrating in the case of pre- historic societies. Unlike literate cultures, prehistoric groups have left us no written texts that might cast light on the purposes of their human representations. What, for example, did corpulent female images mean to early hunter-gatherers of Europe? Why did the people from the Greek Neolithic settlement of Franchthi carve stone figures depicting only the lower half of the human body, or mold a clay figurine with only half a "skirt"? What compelled villagers at a 5,000-year-old site in the Ae- gean to model, and then place with the deceased, small, crude clay figurines? During the past ten years my research has taken me to numerous sites in the Aegean. I have been particu- larly intrigued by the earliest figurines in Greece, which date to the Neolithic period (ca. 6,000-3,000 b.c.), and great goddess was worshiped in Neolithic Greece was based on social and intellectual biases prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One belief was that at an early point in human history women had been socially and politically dominant. The notion was put forth most extensively in the book Das Mutterrecht ( The Motherright ), published in 1861 by Johann J. Bachofen, a Swiss jurist and historian of Roman law. Like other scholars of his day, Bachofen was searching for a theory of social development to explain the evolution of human cultures. Bachofen drew upon a mass of data, including evidence from classical Greece and Rome as well as from published reports by nineteenth-century ethnographers of matriarchal societies in remote parts of the world. Bachofen proposed that, initially, all societies were matriarchal. He argued that the female goddesses of the classical world were vestiges of this earlier matriarchy, which had, at one time, been linked to the worship of an all-powerful female deity. Only later was the power of women and the dominance of a Mother Goddess re- placed by a male-dominated society and male gods. I have become increasingly dissatisfied with traditional interpretations. The first discovery of Neolithic figurines in Greece occurred nearly 100 years ago, when excavations at Knossos on Crete unearthed several anthropomorphic images of clay and stone. Initially, Sir Arthur Evans, director of the excavation, believed that these pieces were associated with the "nether world," perhaps as sub- stitute slaves, retainers, or consorts for the afterlife. Eventually, Evans changed his mind and, along with most Aegean prehistorians, argued that these human images, most of which were thought to be female, were early examples of a much later Mother Goddess known from literary and historical texts of the Near East. The notion of an all-powerful Mother Goddess in the early "religion" of Greece was not, however, a well-con- ceived idea. The arguments rested not on the archaeo- logical contexts of these figurines (none of the contexts readily suggested worship), nor on a careful study of the figures themselves (many of the examples were appar- ently sexless, not female), nor even on a deep understand- ing of early Greek society. Instead, the theory that a Bachofen had both detractors and supporters, spark- ing heated arguments that continue to this day. Modern debate centers on the works of Marija Gimbutas, of the University of California, Los Angeles, who has at- tempted to identify an early matriarchically based pan- theon in Greece and the Balkans. Many archaeologists working in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies embraced Bachofen's views and readily equated the alleged worship of a Mother Goddess with the exis- tence of Stone Age female figurines. Bolstering this be- lief in the early ascendency of an all-powerful Mother Goddess were the writings of Freud and Jung, both of whom believed that devotion to female deities appeared early in the history of human evolution. For at least some schools of thought the influence of Freud and Jung on anthropology still remains strong. Consequently, even though certain scholars were dis- satisfied by the Mother Goddess explanation, the theory remained virtually unchallenged until the 1960s. Only with the emergence of the so-called new archaeology, which demanded more rigorous interpretations of the past, did the field of figurine studies take a critical look July/August 1991 47</page><page sequence="3">ž I at its tenets. In 1968, Peter J. Ucko, of the University of Southampton, published an important book in which he suggested that the Mother Goddess explanation was not defensible for the prehistoric Mediterranean. He outlined a number of weaknesses in the explanation, pointing out that, among other things, the Mother God- dess interpretation did not account for: 1) the number of sexless images in many prehistoric collections; 2) the variety in the types of human representations; 3) the oc- currence of figurines in a bewildering array of archaeo- logical contexts, including rubbish heaps; and 4) the vir- tual absence of prehistoric examples in "ritual" contexts. Ucko suggested, instead, that prehistoric figurines prob- ably served a variety of functions, much as they do among modern nonindustrialized groups in Africa, Australia, and parts of the Americas. Although he could not provide convincing alternative explanations, his work forced archaeologists to rethink the functions of early figurines. Were they, as Ucko suggested, used in initiation rites, as medical figures, or as dolls or toys? Following in the footsteps of Ucko, I have argued that, while some of these early images may represent deities, they more likely served a variety of functions, both sacred and profane. To assume, a priori, that a deity or goddess hides behind every prehistoric human depic- tion is to oversimplify the case. It would be equally erro- neous and simplistic for archaeologists of the future to interpret small plastic images of the Virgin Mary as comparable in function to every small plastic female doll of approximately the same size and stance. Committed to the belief that archaeologists must broaden their interpretations of early human depictions, I turned my attention to the curious case of figurines at Kephala on the Aegean island of Keos. Dating to the end of the fourth millennium (ca. 3300-3200 b.c.), Kephala is a rare example of a Neolithic Greek society whose de- ceased were placed in a formal cemetery apart from domestic living quarters. More commonly in Neolithic settlements, the dead were interred in separate and seem- ingly unrelated locations. Moreover, Kephala is one of the very few communities in the Greek Neolithic where small, anthropomorphic figurines are associated with the dead. The settlement and cemetery at Kephala were exca- vated intermittently between 1960 and 1967 under the direction of the late John Caskey. A final report on the site was published in 1977 by John Coleman of Cornell University. Subject to severe erosion over the millennia, the cemetery, which probably was in use for less than 150 years, sits at the base of a promontory and would have been easily visible to anyone ascending to the small settlement above. Natural clefts and man-made walls clearly delineate the burial area, and at least nine of the 40 burials recovered were marked with small stone platforms. Grave goods were few- ceramic containers, an occasional marble vessel, and, very rarely, a stone tool. Most important, seven anthropomorphic figurines were excavated from the earth near the graves. To understand these figurines and their association with a formal burial ground - a situation that is atypical of the Greek Neolithic, though popular in the ensuing Bronze Age of the Cyclades - I began combing the an- thropological literature on mortuary practices. Upper- most in my mind was thp question: Why would a small Neolithic community choose to build a formal cemetery, particularly when such behavior was unusual? Previously published studies in the field of anthropol- ogy offered one possible explanation. A number of re- ports provided by anthropologists indicated that small- scale, modern, nonindustrialized societies attach very different meanings to placing the dead in a formal ceme- tery, as opposed to disposing of the deceased in separate and scattered locations within a village. Scattered in- humations do not reflect a primary concern, at death, with collective or corporate identity. Rather, it is the in- dividual or personal identity of the deceased that is stressed. On the other hand, formal cemeteries are used to draw attention publicly to a collective or corporate identity, be it familial, political, administrative, or eco- nomic. Such visible and public markers can serve a vari- ety of functions: to delineate territorial boundaries, to symbolize community cohesion, or to mark and reinforce a group's ties with its ancestors and ancestral rights. Most relevant to the evidence at Kephala are the ethno- graphic reports that suggest that small-scale, perma- nently situated settlements intentionally establish and maintain special disposal areas for the dead in order to lay claim to the use or control of local, often critical, re- Rituals associated with these images ensured ties with 48 Archaeology</page><page sequence="4">Formal cemeteries like this one at Kephala are rare for Neolithic settlements in Greece and the Aegean. I Ů sources. The cemetery acts to establish the presence of a group's ancestral ties to the region and, therefore, their rights to the area where these resources are located. If the Kephalans were, in fact, staking their claims to local resources by building a formal cemetery near their settlement, two questions become critical. What, if any- thing, did the figurines have to do with such practices? And, was there sufficient archaeological evidence to identify the possible resources? The answer to the first question was suggested, once again, by the anthropological literature. A survey of re- ports from the past 200 years revealed that figurines placed in and around burials are often associated with ancestor cults. Ancestor images appear among a num- ber of nonurban, nonindustrialized societies, including the Dogon, the Edo, and the Hebbe of North Africa, the Fang and Bokota of Gabon, and the Baluba of Zaire. Most of these groups believe that the soul of the de- parted exerts great power among the living and that those forces continue to live in a specially designed human image. Rituals associated with these images are necessary to ensure ongoing ties with these ancestral spirits and to reaffirm a group's ancestral rights. Both the anthropological literature on mortuary practices and the ethnographic reports on figurines, therefore, seemed to point in the same direction. The cemetery at Kephala was established to legitimize the villagers' control or ownership of the area, and the figu- rines served as ancestor images which chartered Kepha- lan ancestral rights to the region. If this interpretation was reasonable, I needed to re- cover the final piece of the puzzle; namely, what re- sources did the Kephalans perceive as critical to the sur- vival or well-being of their community? This question proved difficult to answer since our current knowledge of Kephalan and Late Neolithic economy is sketchy. Nonetheless, at least three possibilities are viable. First, Kephala is strategically positioned in the Aegean at a convenient crossroads between the Cyclades and the mainland. Moreover, the island is blessed with several good harbors, one of which is just south of the settle- ment. The growing importance of trade, which was to become even more critical in the ensuing Bronze Age, may have led the Kephalans to carefully guard their control of shelter for ships and rights to shoreline an- chorage. Second, Kephala boasts several good sources of marble, though they are less abundant and often less pure than the famous Naxian and Parian types. An im- portant commodity in antiquity, marble may have be- come the focus of local tension and competition on the island. At least two other possible settlements have been identified by surface finds, Paoura and Sykamia. If either of these sites was a settlement of any size, it may have competed with Kephala for local resources, includ- ing marble. Finally, Kephala has produced limited though important evidence of copper metallurgy. Exca- vations recovered a few copper artifacts as well as pieces of slag (the vitreous mass left by the smelting of metallic ore), which testify to the actual working of the metal at the site. Although no local sources of the raw material have been identified, some as yet undetermined aspect of copper production may have been important to the community. Any one of these resources - harbor, mar- ble, or some aspect of copper production - could have been perceived as critical. The cemetery and its associ- ated ancestor images could have been designed to en- sure that the Kephalans maintained restrictive control of, or access to any or all of these resources. Though far from solved, the case of the Kephala figu- rines helps expand and revise our thinking about the use of human images in prehistoric contexts. Clearly, it is no longer acceptable to assume that all Neolithic figurines were sacred or religious, or that, as a group, they served a single purpose. Fortunately, current research is open- ing new avenues of thought. Recent discussions propose that some figurines may have functioned as dolls or toys, as tokens of identification or primitive contracts, and as items used in initiation rites or birthing rituals. The task now confronting prehistoric archaeologists working in the Aegean is to present well-argued interpretations of these early human depictions that take into account: 1) the figurines themselves; 2) their archaeological con- texts; 3) the social and economic concerns of the groups that manufactured these images; and 4) insights gleaned from the ethnographic/anthropological record and judi- ciously applied to the archaeological evidence. As we become more critical and systematic in our analysis of Stone Age figurines, we will approach an understanding of the multiple and no doubt complex reasons that un- derlie the symbolic uses of the human form. ■ July/August 1991 49</page></plain_text>
