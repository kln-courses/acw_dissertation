A complex instance of emendation  comes at Z 5.152, where Schmidt prints the unattested “wandedes” for the manu- script’s unalliterating “mydedes”; Schmidt calls this and other Z emendations  “adventurous” and then explains: Probably the best that can be said by way of defence (or apology) is that each  of these conjectures aspires to what Russell and Kane call “an absolute com- parison between actual readings and abstractions” (II § 219 above). To follow  where angels have not feared to tread is to act, like R-K, in the belief that it is  better to have guessed and erred than never to have guessed at all. (p. 227) (Note that the citation should read II § 129 instead of II § 219.) Schmidt’s state- ment is successfully disarming. An editor who works so transparently, aware of the  element of imagination where science is silent, cannot be faulted for invention,  for ranging a bit in the Zodiac of his own (informed) wit.  Finally, the effect of sole authorship in this edition renders one voice our  companion and guide throughout (will had scores by contrast), and Professor  Schmidt—deeply saturated in the language of Piers, lyrically gifted as a prose  stylist, generous in his learning, and committed to welcoming engagement with  his readership—proves himself a worthy successor not only to Skeat but also to  Holy Church, Conscience, and Patience themselves, as here where he explains  his hopes for his, now complete, edition: [T]he true test of an editorial method’s worth is not in the absolute consis- tency of the theory it exemplifies but the credibility of the text it produces. It is  not the text that is validated by the theory but the theory that is vindicated by  the text. There may be a real, if limited analogy here between critical editing  and experimental science; but the critical question with both is, does it work?  . . . . [T]he determining “test” of the arguments in part IV of this Introduction  and in the Textual Notes must be the edited text in Volume I. In the end a  good edition will meet the needs of a specific readership; a better will serve  several classes of readers; the best will be one that most nearly satisfies the  largest number of different kinds of reader. (p. 32) Schmidt (as with Skeat, the man has now become the book) is a massive treasure- hoard of information about the texts of Piers Plowman and an invitation to endless  adventures in learning and poetry that will keep us all occupied for the next 150  years, at least. Michael Calabrese California State University, Los Angeles The Familiar Enemy: Chaucer, Language, and Nation in the Hundred Years  war. by Ardis butterfield. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. Pp. xxx +  444; 10 illustrations. $99. “It is the continuing argument of this book,” Ardis butterfield observes, “that if  we broaden our attention to English vernacularity and see it as including French  then English precisely changes its shape” (p. 317). Indeed, French became a  fact in England’s linguistic repertoire at the Norman Conquest, and remained  there, in one form or another, for several hundred years. Responding to critical  frames that equate vernacular only with the English language and nationalism  JEGP 111_1 text.indd   130 11/18/11   8:24 AM </page> <page sequence="2"> Book Reviews 131 only with that vernacular, butterfield explores primarily fourteenth- and fifteenth- century materials that illustrate the deep cultural connections between England  and France as well as English and French.  “Nation and Language,” the book’s initial cluster of three chapters, surveys the  sociolinguistic implications of the Hundred Years war as, in many ways, merely  a stage in an ongoing struggle among people sharing religion, literature, and  language. The war has long loomed large in meditations on English and French  nationalism, but butterfield’s interest is in how the shared traditions of England  and France complicate any neat attempts to say when a sense of what it means to  be English does or does not begin. In this vein, she turns to medieval accounts  of premedieval origins: wace’s Brut and the Strasbourg Oaths, which she sees as  (respectively) concerned with “the violence of miscomprehension” and subtle  conciliation (p. 48). This section’s final chapter focuses on “les textes en jargon  Franco-Anglais”—the French fabliaux that turn on Anglophones’ various limita- tions with French, which butterfield regards as linguistic meditations that lead to  a medieval view of English as “a form of French” (p. 99).  The next four chapters—“Exchanging Terms: war and Peace”—begin with  consideration of how aggressive speech acts (like invectives) as represented in  literature undermine the integrity of both French and English. The Knight’s Tale,  she suggests, might well reflect something of the trauma involved in the almost  sibling rivalry of Edward III and Jean II. The following chapter inquires “into the  literary language of trade, especially Chaucer’s, and into the kinds of context  provided by trade for language use” (p. 201). Seeking to conceptualize London  English as a distinct variety, butterfield points to works like London Lickpenny  and Piers Plowman to argue that street cries “functioned as ways of identifying a  particular seller as well as a certain type of goods” (p. 216). The section’s final  chapter illustrates the shared style and literary expressions of French and English  love lyrics.  The Familiar Enemy concludes with three chapters on “Vernacular Subjects.”  Considering Chaucer as well as Charles d’Orléans, these chapters explore the  cultivation of literary authority in the period and the extent to which it might be  considered ethnic or nationalistic. Familiar concepts like a “mother tongue” be- come complicated in such contexts, as does the notion that an English nationalism  must be rooted in the English language alone. Since French continued in England  after the Middle Ages, as did the importance of its significance in English history,  butterfield concludes the book by looking to the representations of language in  the accounts of Joan of Arc and in Shakespeare’s Henry V. In all these ways she  shifts questions about the origins of English unity or nationalism to “what it means  to construct difference” (p. 389).  This is an elegantly written and densely argued book. with impressive detail and  rigor it illustrates just how differently linguistics and literary criticism can approach  the same material. In linguistic accounts of medieval London, for example, the  city’s defining sociolinguistic characteristic is not its multilingual literary culture  but the absorption of Chaucer’s already old-fashioned dialect by a variety that  itself changed in response to immigration from the Midlands and its attendant  sociolinguistic pressures. More generally, when the vast majority of the population  was illiterate (as in the Middle Ages), linguistics approaches the kinds of literary  language discussed here with some skepticism, tending to see them as distinct  from the language itself as an abstract, regular code mapping signifiers onto sig- nifieds. Indeed, the topicalization of linguistic play in fabliaux renders the play  JEGP 111_1 text.indd   131 11/18/11   8:24 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 132 Journal of English and Germanic Philology, January 2012 by its very nature as something marked and separate from ordinary usage and  its implications. In a linguistic frame of reference, what Chaucer or any writer  does with English does not collapse into English, and in the history of English  broadly conceived—English as a language that would grammatically transform  as it spanned the globe within two centuries of the poet’s death—Chaucer’s sig- nificance is arguably minimal.  As an account of the interplay between French and English literary culture, then,  Familiar Enemy is compelling; as an account of linguistic practice, it raises many  provocative issues. For example, while the book speaks of English and French  coming into contact with one another—“English had a competing relationship  with Anglo-French and continental French” (p. 118)—it is not languages but  speakers and perhaps domains that do so. From this view, language contact is less  an anthropomorphic struggle for cultural identity than a series of individuals’  strategic, pragmatic encounters. Instances of this kind of contact are therefore  not always or even often reflective of some larger cultural initiative but, as in the  Strasbourg Oaths, a need to respond to specific sociolinguistic circumstances. It is  this personal, pragmatic view that likewise disrupts the notion that it is “inherently  unlikely that there was very much practical and functional difference between  the two sides linguistically in the fourteenth century” (p. 169). However much  vocabulary and syntax they may share, languages (conventionally understood)  always remain distinct structural entities or it would be impossible for any one  speaker not only to evaluate the well-formedness of any utterance but also to  translate that utterance from one language into another. Conceptually, languages  retain their integrity precisely because—and so long as—speakers want them  to do so. Manuscript treatments of code-switching, the multilingual idiolect of  someone like Gower, the prevalence of macaronic sermons—all these point to the  stability of languages, including varieties of code-switching, within late-medieval  England’s linguistic repertoire. The book’s central claim is “that English needs  revaluing as a far less hard-edged object of study than modern dictionaries lead  us to believe” (p. xxiv). Yet modern dictionaries, in their dialectal, historical, and  national versions, would seem to point to anything but a hard-edged object, even  as the success of communication, modern as well as medieval, points to speakers’  awareness of the practical integrity of the languages they speak.  This is an important book that invites active engagement with its challenging  material. Its general arguments about the interrelations of French and English  literature are cogent and thought-provoking, as are its meditations on what we  mean by nationalism and why it matters. Familiar Enemy will quickly become a  touchstone of future arguments on literature and culture at the end of the English  Middle Ages.
