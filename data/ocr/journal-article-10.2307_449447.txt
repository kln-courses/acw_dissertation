<plain_text><page sequence="1">Statement and Artifice in Thomas Gray PATRICIA M EYER SPACKS THE MAN OF WHOM Adam Smith wrote, "[he] joins to the sublimity of Milton the elegance and har- mony of Pope, and . . . nothing is wanting to render him, per- haps, the first poet in the English language, but to have writ- ten a little more," has been dismissed by Dr. Leavis, relegated by Donald Davie to the limbo reserved for those whose diction is impure, and attacked by A. R. Humphreys for embodying the worst poetic evils of his day. Time has not on the whole been kind to Thomas Gray. One reason for modern dissatisfaction with the poet is the insistent artifice of his diction, its extremity suggested by his own famous pronouncement that "the language of the age is never the language of poetry." Wordsworth and Coleridge were among the first to disapprove. Although they disagreed about which details were farthest removed from true poetry, both used Gray's sonnet to exemplify all those eighteenth- century poems which consist merely of "translations of prose thoughts into poetic language."1 Gray believed that "sense is nothing in poetry, but according to the dress she wears, &amp; the scene she appears in."2 Most modern commentators, following Wordsworth and Coleridge, have thought his muse rather overdressed, seeing in his poetry all the vices of eighteenth- century poetic diction without perceiving that he exemplifies the possibilities of that diction equally well. In 1963, however, F. Doherty provided a new approach. Examining Gray's language in some detail, he concluded that the poet's produc- tions are of two kinds: those dominated by his "public," highly rhetorical "voice," and those in which his "real voice" is discernible.3 The latter category includes most of the poems which seem relatively acceptable (in comparison with, for instance, Gray's long "Pindaric" odes) to the modern reader. Mr. Doherty's analyses of individual passages are highly 'Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, 2 vols.

Some of the poems written in 1742, usually taken as fairly direct expressions of personal emotion, demonstrate not only the artifice in technique in even Gray's most "sincere" poetic statement, but the way in which various sorts of artifice may be deliberately played off against one another. In the "Ode on the Spring," "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College," and "Sonnet on the Death of Richard West," the poet has exploited structural patterns of alternation, passages of direct statement paired with those of highly artificial and indirect suggestion. The combination of a diction which deliberately conceals with a more personal mode of expression is largely responsible for the impact of these poems. The "Ode on the Spring" is the most clearly "Augustan" of the 1742 group. Twenty-five years ago A. R. Humphreys summed up economically the objections that can be made to it: "It is impossible to accept, say, the Ode on the Spring seriously. It has a baroque charm; its warmth of colour, decorative per- sonification, and playful solemnity give it individuality, though hardly perhaps of a different sort than if it were a scene painted on an opulent ceiling."4 Its weaknesses, as defined by Professor Humphreys, are that it is imitative, pedantic, full of "classical pretence" and "anthropomorphic banality." It is clumsy, with "disconcerting hesitations of tone"; and it is totally lacking in personal observation. Most of these objections are valid enough; yet the poem creates its highly individual effect through its exploitation of "classical pretence," its deliberate avoidance of personal observation, in conjunction with its ironic self-revelation. The poem's diction and its "pedantry" are alike most elaborate in the opening stanza, where conventional classical references jostle one another. We are offered Venus and the "rosy- bosom'd Hours," the "Attic warbler," "Cool Zephyrs": the classical paraphernalia of a sort of "nature poetry" which has little to do with nature. The effect of the stanza is to lead the reader's eye awaay from the object: "long-expecting flowers" insists on the flowers' role in the pattern of nature, removing 4"A Classical Education and Eighteenth-Century Poetry," Scrutiny, VIII (1939),204. 520</page><page sequence="3">PATRICIA MEYER SPA CKS stress from their appearance; "purple spring," as Geoffrey Tillotson has pointed out, refers not at all to the actual look of an English spring; even the lovely line, '"The untaught har- mony of spring," about the birds' songs, generalizes rather than describes. One may possibly extract from all this such a scene as is painted on ceilings, but only with effort. The stanza is not really pictorial. It evokes an atmosphere rather than a picture, a delicate, unrealistic, faintly mythological atmosphere, quite remote from actuality. At the beginning of the second stanza, however, there is a shift in language: this sounds more convincingly like the poet's "real voice." The description now is visual as well as "atmospheric"; it sketches a scene with more specificity, more solidity, than that suggested by the poem's opening lines. The scene is, however, hardly less literary in its origins than the panorama which preceded it. The one specific allusion Gray's note here points out is to a native rather than a Latin source: Shakespeare now instead of Virgil. The specific allusion is to A Midsumrmer Night's Dream, but the scene of poet in rural landscape, as well as the reflections the setting immediately inspires, remind us readily too of Jacques in As You Like It. The description seems also to foretell that of the rural poet in the "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard": There at the foot of yonder nodding beech That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high, His listless length at noontide would he stretch, And pore upon the brook that babbles by. (101-104) Both portraits derive indirectly and generally from a more ancient tradition: that of the poet as a figure in pastoral, the swain as poetic orderer of his own experience, in harmony with the world of nature he inhabits. The language of the second stanza is more concrete and direct than that of the first, its images more specific (the "broader, browner shade" of the oak versus "long-expecting flowers"; water with a "rushy brink" as opposed to the vague and evanescent "Cool Zephyrs"), its literary references less exclusively classical. Its tone also demonstrates a radical shift. Metaphorically as well as literally, the first stanza deals with "the clear blue sky." Its tone is elevated; the presentation implies by its concentration on aesthetic pleasure an optimistic view of the natural universe and of man's relation to it. The environment of the second stanza, on the other hand, is a 521</page><page sequence="4">S T A T E M E N T AND A R T I FICE "broader, browner shade." If the first stanza floats away into the heavens, the second remains very much tied to earth; the reflections of the poet who inhabits this landscape are accord- ingly melancholy: How vain the ardour of the Crowd, How low, how little are the Proud, How indigent the Great! (18-20) This is, however, a very easy sort of melancholy, as automatic a response as the optimism which the introductory mythologiz- ing might produce. The reason for its automatic quality is immediately apparent in its source: Gray seems at pains to point out that these ideas about the world are the immediate product of poetic artifice. Beside some water's rushy brink With me the Muse shall sit, and think (At ease reclin'd in rustic state), HIow vain ... (15-18) To stress the presence of the Muse in this setting is to empha- size the deliberate artificiality of the presentation as a whole; the description insists on the actual physical existence of the Muse as well as the poet in the landscape by dwelling on her posture ("At ease reclin'd") and hinting, through the oxy- moron of "rustic state," the faintly humorous overtones im- plicit in the literal presence of this mythological figure in the concrete English setting. She reminds us that these particular lines about the futility of worldly endeavor have little to do with the nature of worldly endeavor. Their source is poetic convention; they represent an attitude rather than a per- ception. The succeeding two stanzas continue the pattern of alterna- tion between different modes of poetic artifice and the atti- tudes associated with them. In the third stanza the images, less emphatically classical (although there is a specific echo of Virgil here), remain conventionally "poetic" and once more stress physical elevation ("The insect youth are on the wing") and the emotional elevation associated with it. The fourth stanza, more closely connected with the preceding one than the second is with the first, shifts, like the second, to a melancholy perspective and an emphasis on earth rather than air ("their airy dance / They leave, in dust to rest"). Its sub- ject matter and point of view, however, are clearly as contrived 522</page><page sequence="5">PATRICIA M EYER SPACKS and as arbitrary as the earlier concern with the way "The busy murmur glows !" The importance of the insistent artifice with which the poet presents his reflections, artifice emphasized by the alterna- tions of mood, theme, reference, emerges fully only in the concluding stanza, where the speaker for the first time con- siders himself not as poet but as man. Until now, the ode has both presented and implied an image of its speaker as poetic contriver, and reminded us, by the nature of the language itself and by Gray's footnotes, how much the poem consists of contrivance. But at the end the artificial, decorative meta- phor of insects which has been manipulated through two stanzas turns on itself and its creator, becoming suddenly strangely real. Artifice has controlled the poem, kept us from taking its insights very seriously; now that artifice reveals something extremely serious about the poet as human being. The conventional "poetic" assertion that insects are like people leads to the forcible realization that people may be like insects-and judging himself as an insect, the poet discovers his limitations as a man ("Poor moralist! and what art thou? / A solitary fly!"). He looks at the reality of his isolated life in terms of his own contrivance; the contrivance now produces fuller awareness of reality. The poignance of the speaker's self-discovery, however, is modified and enriched by the method which produces it. The poem's final effect is of a wry irony which both tempers and reveals the genuine pathos of Gray's sense of himself. If the poet's "voice" is less con- spicuously "public" here than in his grander poems, it is still far from intimate: self-revelation emerges specifically through Gray's awareness of himself as poetic contriver. The poem may, as Lord David Cecil suggests, be one of the utterances of a sensitive spirit in a tragic world,5 but it is more: in a sense its subject is the relation between artifice and reality. Artifice, perceived first as a device for shaping one's perception of reality in arbitrary ways (toward optimism or toward pessi- mism), ultimately helps to provide new insight into reality. The full logical and emotional movement of the poem is in a sense the direct opposite of that in the churchyard elegy, in which the problems of finding a personal role in the world are finally resolved in the figure of the poet. In the "Ode on the 5"The Poetry of Thomas Gray," Proceedings of the British Academy, XXXI (1945), 51. .523</page><page sequence="6">S TATEMENT AND A R TIFICE Spring," on the other hand, the position of poet does not help the man to solve his private dilemma: it only reveals that dilemma to him. In the "Sonnet on the Death of Richard West" the chief tension in the expression is not between two forms of artifice but between artifice and personal statement. Its importance has been recognized by Mr. Doherty ("we are being given an opposition between the 'poetic' presentation of morning and the personal, felt grief," p. 227) and by Geoffrey Tillotson. At the poem's opening, Professor Tillotson points out, Gray "means us to take the 'poetic diction' as dramatic-for though it is himself who is speaking, he speaks by means of quotations from others. ... These things are stock-in-trade, and that is the point of Gray's rejection of them."6 The sonnet's most conventional rhetoric, however, like that in the "Ode on the Spring," serves a double purpose: it exists not simply to be rejected, but also to convey a complex structure of ideas. Five years before his death, West included in a letter to Gray a long poem entitled "Ad Amicos." One section of it sheds light on Gray's later sonnet: I care not tho' this face be seen no more, The world will pass as chearful as before; Bright as before the Day-Star will appear The fields as verdant, and the skies as clear: Unknown and silent will depart my breath, Nor Nature e'er take notice of my death. Yet some there are (ere sunk in endless night) Within whose breasts my monument I'd write: Loved in my life, lamented in my end, Their praise would crown me, as their precepts mend.7 The conjunction between the attitude of "Nature" and that of the friend toward death is here crucial, as it was to be in Gray's sonnet, which supplies an ironic commentary on his friend's poem: for West's assurance that there is value in the lamentations of friendship, Gray substitutes the bitter con- viction that his own isolation emblemizes the futility of mourning I fruitless mourn to him, that cannot hear, And weep the more because I weep in vain.

Its opening quatrain is richest in conventional diction, which functions here, as so often in eighteenth-century poetry, to insist upon the essential tie between man and nature. Mornings, in the universe here invoked, are "smileing," the sun is animated as Phoebus, birds sing an "amorous Descant," fields, "chearful," "resume their green Attire." So emphatic is the insistence that even the inanimate universe partakes of the nature and values of man that it becomes almost painful-which is, of course, pre- cisely the point. In the second quatrain, one's attention is forced to the "lonely Anguish" of the poet. All is red, golden, green, in the opening lines; in the quatrain which follows them, all is bare and comparatively abstract. The hardly perceptible meta- phors are embodied entirely in verbs: the poet's ears "repine" for other notes than those of the birds; his heart "melts"; joys "expire" in his breast. Nouns and adjectives have carried the weight of the figures in the opening picture of joyous nature; in the description of solitary grief, there is no picture at all. The significance of the contrast is fully revealed in the third quatrain, which explains the vital fact-not explicitly recognized in West's poem-that all parts of nature function together, in a union which includes "happier Men," and all has a purpose. Appropriately, Gray here returns to that "poetic diction" so well-adapted to the presentation of optimistic views of the natural world. The lines are less colorful than the opening ones, but as highly figured; they convey also a new poignance (partly the result of the contrast that has been established), which is exemplified in the beautiful line, "To warm their little Loves the Birds complain."8 Here is a fine emblem of the terrible difference Gray perceives between him- self and the rest of the world: the "complaint" of the birds has a function and a value, it participates in the demonstration of love; his own quite different complaint reaches no hearer and produces no positive effect. West maintains that nature and friendship both provide compensations, of different sorts, for death; his point of view is that of the man conscious of his mortality, contemplating the prospect of his own dissolution. 8Mr. Doherty has an interesting discussion of the language of this line in "The Two Voices of Gray," p. 229. 525</page><page sequence="8">STATEMENT AND A R TI FICE Gray, considering death from an equivalent viewpoint in the "Elegy," was to manifest a similar attitude: For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey, This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd, Left the warm precincts of the chearful day, Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind? On some fond breast the parting soul relies, Some pious drops the closing eye requires; Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries, Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires. (85-92) The prospective victim needs to believe in the existence of "some fond breasts," needs to feel that he will not be entirely prey to "dumb Forgetfulness." The "voice of Nature" cries from the tomb to the survivors who may preserve the "wonted Fires" of their departed friends perhaps by the power of their memory; more specifically, Gray's footnote reference to Petrarch and the context of the entire elegy suggest, by the power of poetry to preserve life. But the ultimate faith in the human significance of the poet which dominates the elegy is not so strong in the earlier sonnet, where the artifice of poetry, as in the "Ode on the Spring," reveals its inadequacy to compensate for the ravages of feeling. Gray's viewpoint, in the West sonnet, is that of the survivor; he writes from direct knowledge rather than from observation. And, as the poet-survivor, he contradicts the more speculative conclusion of the passage from West's poem, insisting that nature, through its denial of grief, only intensifies one's solitude in sorrow (solitude more intensely poignant than that perceived by the speaker in the end of the "Ode on the Spring"), and that the monument which West imagines within the breasts of his friends must be shaky indeed, when the natural universe refuses it any real foundation. Wordsworth obviously perceived the deliberate alternation of rhetorical patterns in this sonnet. The five lines that he italicizes as "the only part of this Sonnet which is of any value" include all but one of the lines where Gray deals, in deliberately bare language, with his own isolation in suffering. (The sixth presumably fails to receive Wordsworth's accolade because it includes an "alas!".) Modern readers, however, may more readily see the extent to which Gray here-as often elsewhere-employs contrasting modes of poetry as a technique of cross-commentary. Certainly he does not reject the elaborate 526</page><page sequence="9">PATRICIA MEYER SPACKS diction of his opening lines: he recognizes and exposes its value in conveying the beauty and unity of the natural world. But he recognizes also its limitations, as a mode of insight and of expression. It is not, after all, adequate to express the misery of solitary grief; the poet as artificer cannot merely through convention communicate the sorrow of the poet as man. In the long "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College," rhetorical variations are more complex in technique and in function. Here too Gray's shifts of rhetoric deepen and compli- cate the meaning of his poem; the ode's form directly illumin- ates its content. That content, simply stated, seems to be the glorification of boyhood at the expense of adulthood. Wordsworth praised the child for his supernal widom; Gray envies him his ignorance: "where ignorance is bliss, / 'Tis folly to be wise." But the ironies of this aphorism are so inclusive that they virtually transform the entire poem. Sir Leslie Stephen complained about this ode that it "comes into conflict with one's common-sense. We know too well that an Eton boy is not always the happy and immaculate creature of Gray's fancy."9 Certainly a more unrealistic picture of boy- hood can seldom have been offered. The poem opens with a stanza so highly rhetorical that it might have been designed to provide examples of various figures and tropes. In ten lines we find repeated instances of apostrophe, metaphor, per- sonification, alliteration, inversion, repetition, parallelism. The invocation to the towers of Eton has little reference to real experience, and the elaborate description it introduces of the joys of Eton's inhabitants is hardly more convincing. "Gray thought his language more poetical as it was more remote from common use," objected Dr. Johnson,10 with par- ticular reference to the phrase, "redolent of joy and youth," which Gray here uses to evoke the "gales" that blow from Eton; we may be tempted to agree. Perhaps even more "re- mote from common use" is the description of youthful sport: What idle progeny succeed To chase the rolling circle's speed, Or urge the flying ball? (28-30) 9"Gray and His School," Hours in a Library (London, 1892), III, 118-119. '?Lives of the English Poets, ed. G. B. Hill, 3 vols. (Oxford, 1905), III, 435. 527</page><page sequence="10">STATEMENT AND ARTIFICE The rhetorical tone is maintained, although the language is more immediately evocative, in the succeeding description of boyish enterprise: Some bold adventurers disdain The limits of their little reign, And unknown regions dare descry: Still as they run they look behind, They hear a voice in every wind, And snatch a fearful joy. (35-40) Finally, Gray presents a list of the students' attributes, in- cluding buxom health of rosy hue, WVild wit, invention ever-new, And lively chear of vigour born; The thoughtless day, the easy night... (45-48) In the three-stanza treatment of the denizens of Eton, the movement has been from particularity to generalization, from the concrete to the abstract. It may be hard to feel "particular- ity" in such a phrase as "the rolling circle's speed," but, elevated though it is, it, like all periphrases, refers to some- thing specific (in this case, a hoop). The final stanza of the triad, on the other hand, deals solely with abstractions: "hope," "health," "wit," "fancy," "invention," "chear," "vi- gour." The poet's language now is less pretentious than that which he expends on swimming, bird-catching, and hoop-roll- ing; his nostalgic tone is more marked. But vague nostalgia and pretentious periphrasis have the same general effect: to make the reader acutely aware of the element of distance in this "distant prospect" of Eton. The past is perceived only through a haze; a light that never was on sea or land glows about the blissful young scholars. The persuasive artifice of the presentation, the unrelieved insistence of the rhetorical dis- tancing, force the reader to be always conscious of the poet as manipulator of reality. From the joys of youth the poem proceeds, after a transi- tional stanza, to the evils of maturity. The transition, intensely emotional, concludes, "Ah, tell them, they are men!" In its highly charged bareness, this line foretells the technique of the poem's final stanza; yet immediately after it Gray returns to his more elaborate style. He relies now almost entirely on heavy use of personification, a new form of artifice in this 528</page><page sequence="11">PATRICIA M E YER SPA CKS ode, and one which provides its own kind of "distancing" for the image of adulthood's horrors. The personifications are very good of their kind. Like most such figures in their period, they are strongly traditional in conception, yet Gray individualizes them. The passions are, here as in so many other eighteenth-century poems, "the fury Passions." They are also, however, "The vulturs of the mind": an addition which removes their dignity, makes them more concretely destructive, may recall the tortures of Prometheus, sordid and endless. Despair is "grim-visag'd" and "comfort- less": obvious epithets, but sharply evocative of despair's special qualities: its almost deliberate grimness, its inability either to offer comfort to its victim (like gentler forms of sor- row) or to receive comfort from any source. Infamy is "grin- ning," Madness, "moody"; Poverty "numbs the soul with icy hand." In each case, the relevant detail insists both upon the horror which these qualities have in common and on the special dreadfulness of each specific state. Indeed, the descriptions of maturity-despite the fact that they are allegorical-are on the whole a good deal more con- crete than those of youth. This parade of personifications comprises a metaphorical vision of adulthood to parallel the glamorized vision of youth that has preceded it. Gray seems to feel far more vividly (as is, of course, appropriate enough) the realities of manhood than those of youth, although cer- tainly his nostalgia for childhood is as acute as his horror of the universal fate of the adult. The allegorical presentation of phenomena, however vivid, is not "realistic"; the lack of realism in the description of man's fate is as striking as that in the evocation of childhood. The high rhetorical tone in both cases points to the fact that Gray's rhetoric is often associated with imaginative vision: his elaborations, decorations, heavy use of rhetorical tricks indicate his concern with something other than literal truth. In the sonnet on West, a vision of natural unity is placed in conjunction with the harsh reality of individual pain; in the "Ode on the Spring," two "literary" visions ultimately reveal the actuality of the solitary poet. In the Eton ode, too, there are two visions: of childhood and of adulthood, both deliber- ately removed from actuality, both containing elements of truth. The truth of the vision of manhood is immediately and 529</page><page sequence="12">STATEMENT AND ARTIFICE forcibly apparent; the imaginative and emotional power of the personifications attest the conviction of the author, and one has no doubt of Gray's sincerity. The remoteness of personifi- cations from actual experience, the "distancing" involved in the use of this device, are a way of emphasizing the horror of maturity in reality: one suspects that it is too dreadful to be discussed more directly; the poet must find metaphors to make his perceptions tolerable. This suspicion sheds light back on the earlier vision of childhood, and the way in which artifice makes this poem's intensely personal quality possible. If a man's perceptions about maturity are essentially insights into its horrors, it follows that he may find it necessary to glamorize his perceptions about childhood; if beauty cannot be located in the present, it must be asserted of the past or the future. Gray's clearly artificial presentation of childhood as "paradise" emphasizes the agony of his experience of adult- hood. Mr. Doherty comments that in Gray's "more plangent poems" he reveals himself as "a man whose historical sensi- bility demands of him that the present be always seen as part of a movement of time" (p. 229). A sense of that movement is clearly present in this ode, but it is a movement relentlessly downward. Both visions emphasize this fact. The final stanza of the Eton ode represents a return to the barer style which Gray used so effectively in the sonnet on West. In it there is only one strong metaphor, no striking inversions; the diction, with the exception of one rhetorical "ah !", is such as Wordsworth might approve. But the simpler style in no way denies the validity of the affirmations which the rhetorical sections have made; here emotion derives from vision without conflicting with it. Resignation is achieved as a result of perceptions which provide a more than "realistic" insight into the nature of reality. That resignation, faintly bitter, is summed up in the final assertion of the folly of wisdom "where ignorance is bliss." Although the aphorism has the form of a general statement (and is frequently taken, out of context, to be one), its refer- ence in the poem is particular, to the nature of youth and of manhood. Its fundamental ironies are twofold. First, the en- tire poem has demonstrated that the bliss of ignorance and the folly of wisdom are alike inevitable in human life. The con- cluding statement (like the earlier rhetorical question, "why should they know their fate?") appears to offer the possibility 530</page><page sequence="13">PATRICIA MEYER SPACKS of choice, but in neither case does an alternative really exist. The nature of childhood, the nature of maturity, are fore- ordained: one may perhaps hope to be aware of them, but can do nothing to change them. It is the fate of mankind to move from blissful ignorance to foolish wisdom; it is perhaps the nature of men to coin aphorisms which justify both states. Second, the poem as a whole has defined both "ignorance" and "wisdom" in ways involving built-in ironic overtones. "Ignorance" here is specifically ignorance of the horrors that lie in store for all human beings; "wisdom" consists in awareness of those horrors. A few years after Gray wrote his Eton ode, Dr. Johnson, in "The Vanity of Human Wishes," suggested his scorn of the suppliant for long life who Hides from himself his state, and shuns to know, That life protracted is protracted woe. Scorn was possible for Johnson because he saw his characters in a religious context: it is shortsighted and ridiculous to pray for length of life on earth if one is convinced that a better existence may be the aftermath of human suffering. In Gray's ode, on the other hand, the language of religious hope is re- served for references to departed childhood. That is the state of "bliss," that the "paradise" which thought can only destroy. The wisdom of adulthood is damning; failure to know that life protracted is protracted woe is the best that human existence can offer. The sudden shift to relatively undecorated language in the final stanza emphasizes the despair which awareness of these ironies can produce. The stanza's first line echoes the earlier line which most clearly prepared for the ending. "Ah, tell them, they are men !" the poet cried before, of the schoolboys; now he reminds us, "To each his suff'rings: all are men." Children and adults alike participate inevitably in the miseries of being human. The straightforward language throws into sharp relief the earlier elaboration and reveals the intimate relation of form and content in the ode. For the artifice and formality which controlled the presentation of childhood's joy and maturity's misery reflect a further meaning of "wisdom." To this extent alone does the wisdom derived from experience have power: it can formulate its record of experience so as to make it artistically viable. The suffering of mankind is com- municated no less intensely for being embodied in personifica- 531</page><page sequence="14">S TATEAMENT AND A R TIFl CE tions, but the use of such figures suggests a kind of order and meaning in that suffering. The joys of boyhood are purged of imperfection by being rhetorically described; the conjunc- tion of the two visions, of suffering and of joy, provides a perception of pattern in human life. But this function of wis- dom, too, is merely folly. When rhetoric is virtually abandoned, as in the concluding stanza, and the poet speaks directly of his sense of the ultimate disorder of experience (suggested by the reversal of values in the final lines: the notion that wisdom is a high good is essential to most concepts of an ordered uni- verse), his revelation is the more forceful for its contrast with what has gone before. Once more Gray has demonstrated his extraordinary skill at playing off highly controlled rhetoric against simple, direct statement. The rhetorical oppositions manifested in these poems are, however, by no means characteristic of Gray's later work. They dramatize a sense of tension which was to remain im- portant in his poetry, but in different forms. The poems I have selected for attention here are perhaps experimental in their playing with technique; their manipulation of artifice seems largely responsible for the conspicuous success of the experi- ments. In the relatively direct verse of the "Elegy" and the highly formalized patternings of the 1757 odes, however, Gray does not employ any clear alternations of technique, nor does he point to his own reliance on artifice. Instead, the conflicts of values which both interested and perplexed him as a poet are directly expressed as part of the subject. These later poems pose problems of a very complicated sort, problems best dealt with in terms of other formulations than those which provide perspective on the function of artifice in the poems of 1742.
