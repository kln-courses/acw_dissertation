C est une epreuve qui peut conduire, dans le meilleur des cas, le temps aidant, a la mise en question dun parti pris ou dun choix. -Genevieve Bolleme 1 A n examination of literary histories reveals that scholars often try to convey L' the "development" of literature in terms of a simple and compelling idea or A. interpretation, but in the process sometimes neglect the complexities of the material under consideration. This is certainly true of the way literary histories and critical studies have treated the Japanese popular prose of the early seventeenth century: typically, they have sought out texts deemed to have the characteristics of a "shosetsu" and either ignored or condemned as failures those that lacked such traits.2 Scholars working in this area have held that the "shosetsu-like" prose of this particular period constitutes a specific genre known as kanazdshi . This supposed genre is the subject of this article. Kanazdshi are part of an orderly and clear-cut evolutionary pattern in which rigid literary genres develop and succeed one another. First there were the otogizdshi The author is lecturer in Japanese studies at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom. Her field is early modern Japanese literature. She would like to thank Peter Kornicki for the incom- mensurable help that he gave her with this article from its inception. Her gratitude also extends to the two anonymous referees who read the first version of this article and provided her with valuable comments. 1 "Rereading what has been written, rereading texts about which people have written and reflected, is a critical enterprise in which everyone unconsciously engages. It is an exercise that, in the best-case scenario and with the help of time, can lead to the questioning of preconceived opinions or specific choices." Andries and Bolleme 2003, p. 543. 2 Although almost all Japanese scholars of seventeenth -century popular prose concur with this search for so-called shosetsu, we curiously almost never encounter a clear definition of what they Monumenta Nipponica 65/2: 297-356 Â© 2010 Sophia University</page><page sequence="2">298 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) jo{jj a popular form of prose circulating in the Muromachi period by means of manuscripts and oral narration or performance; at the beginning of the seventeenth century this genre faded away, to be replaced by kanazdshi , which itself is thought to have lasted only until 1682, when publication of Ihara Saikakus Koshoku ichidai otoko fe- * ftf? launched the new genre of ukiyozoshi In this scheme kanazdshi are considered a literature of transition, having little intrinsic value and constituting merely a preparatory phase for the mature prose of Saikaku and later ukiyozoshi writers. Although, as discussed below, some doubts have been raised about these specific categories, they remain the established view both in Japan and in the West of the development of Japanese popular prose in this period. Challenging that view, this article offers a new, alternative perspective. The meth- odological approach adopted here is to consider seventeenth -century popular prose production within its own context, looking for internal and contemporaneous evidence and avoiding any ahistorical discourse that imposes later or foreign concepts, such as "shosetsu" and "novel," or that defines genres in an acritical and retrospective a posteriori fashion. Following this approach, we shall discover that the literary panorama of seventeenth-century popular prose in print and the development of this prose are considerably different from what has been accepted to date. The case for this alternative perspective will be made in several stages. The first stage is a condensed discussion of the scholarship produced to date. While the aim is certainly to provide the context for my arguments, I shall also show that the conception of the "shosetsu-like kanazdshi genre" is an anachronistic and incon- sistent label produced in the Meiji period but nonexistent as such in the Edo period. mean by this term. In a way the shared attitude is the rather tautological one demonstrated in 1942 by Ehara Taizo SRHKiMSJc when he affirmed, "What I call here shosetsu is not an accurate category in scholarship, nor something that I say from a pure literary stance, but rather a general term used for conveniences sake for a shosetsu-like text." Ehara 1942, p. 40. We can gain a somewhat more precise image of what "shosetsu" is thought to mean from an analysis of a pivotal work written by Noda Hisao if EW3I. From the hundreds of pages that Noda devotes to the presentation of seventeenth-century texts, and from his brief comments about the shosetsu-like nature of these texts, we can infer that the requisite qualities are as follows: First, the presence of what Noda calls "setsuwa" - that is, a story or embedded stories - constitutes the watershed between a text that can be labeled shosetsu-like and a text that cannot. A setsuwa usually shows a unitary plot, internal coherence, a touch of realism, and a certain amount of fictiveness. Aoyama Tadakazu WU4&amp;- speaks in similar terms when he values monogatarisei (i.e., narrative nature) as a discriminating element for identifying a good text. The second requirement is the presence of characters who act within the story. The third is a "literary taste" that the story must possess. Even though Noda gives no definition of literature, we can infer that such features as the presence of poetry, the disclosure of the personal experience of the author, and the use of previous literary sources all contribute to a "literary" nature. Teruoka Yasutaka H: is the only scholar who has attempted to define the term bungeisei (literariness), and he insists on three criteria: whether or not a work embodies a literary stance in its structure and its rhetoric, includes an aspect that moves and ennobles the feelings, and has a universal character. See Noda 1986; Aoyama 19 66, p. 41; and Teruoka 1940.</page><page sequence="3">Moretti: Kanazoshi Revisited 299 The outcome of this analytical journey through the secondary literature will be a pro- posal that we abandon the view that the genre named kanazoshi exists or ever existed. This will allow us to recover the original ground against which popular prose litera- ture in print actually came into being at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The proposal to remove kanazoshi as a genre from literary histories might appear at first sight identical to that already made by Konishi Jinichi in 1986.3 Despite their superficial similarities, however, these two proposals lead to different results, particularly with respect to the shaping of a new system to give order to the production of popular literature in the early Edo period. As a second stage, I analyze the real boundaries of the popular prose of this time, when printing techniques were applied in the Kamigata region in order to address a wider public. I identify a much broader target in the "forest of books"4 in Japanese that appeared at the beginning of the seventeenth century, without impos- ing any limitations resulting from the search for "novels," "shosetsu," or "literature." This implies a reflection on the role and effects that nonnarrative texts5 - those that belong to the "library of public information" as defined by Mary Elizabeth Berry - had within this panorama.6 The third stage is an attempt to give a new order to this huge and amorphous tex- tual corpus that does not - and I would like to insist on this point - constitute a genre in itself. The system I propose will be a flexible one that takes into account and com- bines a plurality of parameters, avoiding any Manichaean distinction and valuing hybridism as a positive hallmark. And it will be dynamic, by offering an alternative 3 Konishi 1986, p. 385. Unfortunately, his proposal remained largely ignored by both the Japa- nese and the Western academic worlds. 4 Quotation from a maeku that reads, shokuji yori /fumihayashi wa / habikorite H' 9T (Thanks to the carving of signs / the forest of books / is growing thickly). It is included in the 1703 zappai anthology Fudanzakura and composed on the subject "Their species increases more and more." Fudanzakura , 20a. 5 Throughout this article I employ the definition of "narrative" established by some of the most recent theoretical studies on the subject: the representation of at least two events (actions and happenings) that entail a change, that possess an internal time sequence, and that show coher- ence, occurring in a world populated by intelligent individuals and "existents" (i.e., objects). See Abbott 2002, pp. 12-13; Prince 2003, pp. 58-61; and Ryan 1992, pp. 369-70. "Nonnarrative" implies the negation of these qualities and refers to halts imposed on the story and made up of "extended descriptions, meta-narrative comments, digressions, narratorial and authorial interventions, general considerations, and philosophical meditations." Ryan 1992, p. 375. To these nonnarrative elements I also add others such as practical or enlightening treatises, encyclopedic explanations, recipes, and didactic dialogues. I do not consider narrative and nonnarrative as a binary set, but rather as two poles in between which many nuances are possible. Therefore I make use of another category defined by the most recent theoretical studies about narrative: the concept of "narrativ- ity." Narrativity "assesses the role of the story with respect to the whole of the text" (Ryan 1992, p. 369) and must be considered a matter of "degree" or of "modes" (i.e., narratives that are more or less narrative than others). 6 Berry 2006.</page><page sequence="4">300 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) view of the continuities and of the differences recognizable in the development of popular prose production, namely in connection with the Muromachi period and with the period after Saikaku's debut. As mentioned above, the system I introduce here differs markedly from that proposed by Konishi. I seek not simply to account for the continuation of preexisting Muromachi-period genres, but also to recognize new genres that may or may not have roots in Muromachi prose and to account for the novelties brought about in popular literature as a result of print. In the structure I propose, I do not recognize any substantial change in Saikaku's work. My framework tries to offer answers to the issues left open and considered most urgent by Kikuchi Shin ichi in 1989. 7 It does so using a lens not applied before in this specific literary area and therefore constitutes a preliminary proposal that may be further expanded, enriched, and revised by future research. I should make it clear that this system is not in itself the aim of the present study. Rather, it is proposed here simply to give us a set of new tools with which to under- stand and appreciate what was maintained in popular literature from the Muromachi period until the end of the Edo period and, at the same time, what emerged when this popular literature - which already existed both in manuscripts and in the form of oral narration or performance- was put into print and evolved in the medium of print. This brings us to the fourth and final stage, which consists of a discussion of some of the elements I recognize as constituting novelty in the development of popular prose, in particular the crossbreeding of narrative and nonnarrative parts in the same work, the presence of an unprecedented thematic and generic hybridism within the same textual entity, and a tendency toward textual mouvance - in other words, textual instability or fluidity - dictated by the need to answer the expectations and meet the tastes of new readers. In the course of this discussion, I will take up several specific works and examine them within my revised view of the popular prose literature of the beginning of the Edo period. This study, therefore, constitutes the foundation for a larger research project in the future. Let us start with a critical survey of the existing secondary literature. 7 Kikuchi recognizes as issues six points: (1) the distinction between literariness and lack of literariness, (2) the distinction between novel and nonnovel (here used in the sense of "narrative" and "nonnarrative"), (3) the place of manuscripts, (4) the distinction between kanazdshi and otogizoshi , (5) the treatment of translations of Chinese and Western texts, and (6) the distinction between what comes before and after 1682. See Kikuchi 1989, pp. 34-36. 1 offer answers to the second, fourth, and sixth points without recognizing the need to make any "distinctions," but rather by discussing possible crossbreeding and contaminations. The first point is not an issue since, as I shall discuss in due course, here I apply a general definition of "literature" that encompasses the vast world of the written word. It is my intention to deal with the third and fifth points in future research.</page><page sequence="5">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 301 The Genesis of a Critical Aporia : A Brief Survey of Studies on Kanazoshi Where does the concept kanazdshi come from? Japanese research in the field commonly acknowledges that the first scholar to use kanazdshi as a technical term to describe a specific literary genre was Mizutani Futo in 1897.8 When reading Mizu- tani on kanazdshi , it is important to bear in mind that he worked in the context of Meiji views of literature and the novel. Many of his works were published with the approval of Tsubouchi Shoyo 1*1 Mil, an intellectual partnership with implica- tions that will be immediately evident to the scholar of Japanese literature.9 In his definition of kanazoshiy Mizutani focused on a very specific period of production limited to the Kanbun era: Those booklets ( soshirui H), which were produced in the Kanbun % i era [1661-1673] with the aim of spreading general knowledge, presented adaptations of Chinese works, of Buddhist texts, or of classical literature, converting their verbal texture into easy kana [hiragana] . We generally name these texts kanazdshi. It may seem strange that we apply this term only to works written in kana in the aforementioned era, and not to all books written in kana. Classical works are certainly written in kana, but they belong to the world of ga (elegance) and therefore are not meant to be read by everyone. After the Genroku tc# era [1688-1704], even soshi booklets began to include difficult kanji with furigana added. They were still meant for women and girls, but we must note that the booklets written in the Kanbun era avoided as much as possible any kanji apart from those in daily use.10 In the pages that follow this brief account, he enlarges this limited view by includ- ing works produced from the Kanei era (1624-1644) onward by authors such as Nyoraishi $P AS-?*, Suzuki Shosan Yamaoka Genrin iJLiPtEF^, and Asai Ryoi The criteria upon which he based his definition of kanazoshi include the form of written language adopted in these texts (mainly hiragana with sparing use of the most common kanji) and the didactic function they were thought to play. For Mizutani, the use of kana implied the texts were written in Japanese and there- fore stood on completely different ground from texts written in kanbun. In 1929 Mizutani partially revised his definition, on the one hand reinforcing his recognition of the use of kana as the main parameter and on the other hand acknowl- edging that they had a recreational purpose as well as an enlightening function.11 He wrote of texts that were "literary works" ( bungakuteki sakuhin and that were recreational, almost useless (goraku no kanmoji or gorakuteki kanmoji ^ 8 Mizutani 1897, pp. 12-53. In the West, apart from a passing reference in Keene 1976, p. 164, note 1 ("The first use of kana zoshi as a term designating the literature written between 1600 and 1682 occurs in a work published in 1897"), there has been no discussion of this aspect of the kanazdshi issue in print. The topic was raised briefly on the Premodern Japanese Studies online forum in 2001, but unfortunately no sign of subsequent discussion has been visible to date. 9 In my view, the presence of Tsubouchi's name in Mizutani s work suggests a consonance in their views about literature and, most of all, in their interest in the novel as conceptually developed in the Meiji period, chiefly due to the theoretical contributions of Tsubouchi himself. 10 Mizutani 1897, p. 12. 11 Mizutani 1929.</page><page sequence="6">302 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) It was in 1926 that he had fixed the temporal boundaries of kanazdshi, considering the end of the Keicho SUS era (1596-1615) as the starting point and the Tenna era (1681-1684), when Koshoku ichidai otoko was published, as the end. He noted that in the past Saikaku's works had been considered to be kanazdshi , but without further explanation or justification stated that they were now to be included in a separate genre called ukiyozdshi.13 He took more works into account than he had in 1897, but the number still did not go beyond forty titles.14 What we notice as a constant in Mizutanis work is a curious lack of interest in defining the specific features that might characterize kanazdshi as a literary genre. The choice of "texts written in kana" and "texts written either for the entertainment or for the enlightenment of the reader" as criteria certainly poses many problems and does not clarify the conceptual boundaries. In particular, there has long been perplexity about the literary nature of the texts produced in this great span of time and their relationship with the novel. For example, in 1922 Fujioka Sakutaro claimed that "the novels of this period did not yet stand independently as pure literature (jun bungaku for most of them were rather books of morals or topography and were undergoing a process of novel-ization ( shosetsuka /Mftfb); in other words, they were nothing more than anomalous novels ( hentai no shosetsu ^ ftW'Mft) used for the sake of education (gakumon ^fnj), moral instruction ( kyokun ficfJII), and preaching ( dendo fÂ£)8)."15 That is probably why, as early as 1932, Suzuki Nobuyuki 7^1Â®# felt the need to make a distinction between a broad and a narrow meaning for the term kanazdshi.16 The broader meaning referred to texts written in simple kana, including the monogatari of the Heian period, Muromachi tales, Bud- dhist or Confucian primers, historical works, geographical descriptions, and so on; the restricted meaning encompassed only works that could be defined as shosetsu or textual entities similar to shosetsu, limiting the temporal boundary to works composed after the Keicho era.17 Suzuki unfortunately did not define what he meant by "shosetsu," but the impression that his study conveys is that he shared a view of shosetsu influenced by current ideas of the Western novel.18 Of the two meanings 12 Mizutani 1929, p. 9. 13 Mizutani 1926, p. 1. The distinction between kanazdshi and ukiyozdshi was first established in a series of lectures delivered by Fujioka Sakutaro in 1905 and published in 1917. See Fujioka 1917, p. 14. Fujioka later reiterated the distinction in Fujioka 1922, p. 328. 14 In a 1919 monograph in two volumes entitled Kanazdshi , Mizutani provided bibliographic analyses of thirty texts that he claimed to have selected out of seventy to eighty under study. See Mizutani 1919. 15 Fujioka 1922, p. 290. 16 Suzuki 1932, p. 25. 17 This second meaning was shared almost immediately by other scholars. For example, in the following year Ehara Taizo defined kanazdshi as "a category of literature that appeared at the beginning of the Edo period" and that "followed the Muromachi-period otogizoshi and preceded Saikakus ukiyozdshi " Ehara 1933, p. 3. 18 For further details about the expectations raised by the word "shosetsu," see note 2.</page><page sequence="7">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 303 for kanazdshi , Suzuki chose to work within the framework of the second. He claimed that in order to create a literary history of the Edo period it was appropriate to work only on texts that were related to the world of shosetsu. Recognition of both these meanings presents the intellectual dilemma he and others faced and that we still face today: whether to include as kanazdshi all texts predominantly in kana produced in the Edo period up to Saikaku or only shosetsu-like texts from this period.19 None- theless, subsequent studies have for the most part been preoccupied with the search for shosetsu-like texts produced between 1600 and 1682.20 From the Showa period onward, hundreds of critical works have been published on the kanazdshi issue in Japan.21 All of them perpetuate the ideas that kanazdshi con- stitute a literary genre and that they are shosetsu. In other words, the need shared by these studies is that of constructing a "literary history" of the pre-Saikaku Edo-period novel and of the genre named kanazdshi. What we are left with is a large number of seventeenth-century works subsumed under a genre constructed a posteriori on the basis of a suggestion made by Mizutani: a huge genre entrapped in the chronologi- cal boundaries of 1600 and 1682 and in the ideological boundaries of "shosetsu" and "literature." This "genre," though, is an arbitrary construct. In fact, to date no clear parameters (apart from having been written in Japanese and mainly in hiragana) have ever been evoked to define its characteristics; paradoxically, nothing unequivocally tells us what kanazdshi are or are not. Yet, there is a genre label that can be applied to all texts thought to exhibit the nature of kanazdshi.22 19 For example, in 1969 Noda Hisao underlined the necessity of including in the study of kanazdshi those texts that are not "literary texts" ( bungeisho jt^Hr), even though he himself unconsciously - or consciously, we do not know - contradicted this view in a later work that concentrated on the history of shosetsu. See Noda 1969, p. 318; and Noda 1986. In 1989 Kikuchi Shin ichi posed the problem once more and declared that the time had come to define kanazdshi and decide whether or not they include only shosetsu. See Kikuchi 1989, p. 39. The question remains open to date, and Fukasawa Akio one of the leading scholars in the field of kanazdshi , pointed out in a lecture held at Showa Women's University on 16 February 2006 that "if we consider as normative in the literary history of the novel (shosetsu) a sequence in which otogizoshi were replaced by kanazdshi and kanazdshi were then replaced by ukiyozoshi , it is up to future scholars to decide how to cope with texts that are outside the boundaries of shosetsu." Fukasawa 2006 (transcript kindly provided by Fukasawa Akio). Fukasawa discusses the same con- cern in the afterword to a 2006 anthology of secondary sources on kanazdshi : "Today the domain of kanazdshi is not defined. There is a broader view and a narrow one - focusing on shosetsu - and this is an important issue that must be taken up by future studies." Fukasawa and Kikuchi 2006, vol. 8, afterword, p. 2. See also Fukasawa 1994. 20 See, for example, Noda 1947, p. 25; and Noda 1978, pp. 12-13. 21 In 2004, Fukasawa Akio and Kikuchi Shin'ichi published a complete bibliography of these works, and an ongoing update is accessible at the Kinsei Shoki Bungei Kenkyukai Web site. See Fukasawa and Kikuchi 2004. A selection from the secondary literature is available in Fukasawa and Kikuchi 2006. 22 There have been attempts to detect a common trait in kanazdshi. For example, in several studies Ehara Taizo claims to see in all texts an enlightening ( keimoteki ^ II Eft) and practical (jitsuyoteki nature that addresses a wide public. See Ehara 1932; Ehara 1933; and Ehara 1942.</page><page sequence="8">304 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) Presented to the West for the first time in an article by Richard Lane in 1957, the standard view of seventeenth-century prose discussed above has been adopted in most Western studies of Japanese literature.23 Lanes study is not only the first article to have been written on kanazdshi in a Western language, but also the only one to have appeared to date that focuses on the kanazdshi issue as a whole. Lane relies much on the scholarship of those he calls "modern critics" in order to define what he means by kanazdshi , which he describes as works "written in the easily compre- hensible kana, and in mixed kana and Chinese characters" that were produced in the Edo period up to the early 1680s.24 It is true that the word "genre" never appears in connection with kanazdshi in his long article; nonetheless, the decision to position this literary corpus between the Muromachi otogizdshi and the so-called ukiyozoshi of Saikaku and his successors, which he defines as a "quite new genre" of "realistic novels," suggests that Lane recognized it as such.25 Lane describes this genre as "the first prose literature of the Edo period," written for "popular consumption," that is essentially "romantic, didactic and transitionally realistic fiction."26 He considers that a "didactic strain" ran through all kanazdshi , but he focuses on the presence of fictional elements, even while admitting that "the term kanazdshi , much like the term novel' in seventeenth-century England, embraces a wide variety of material, with essays, guidebooks, philosophical discussion, semi-historical works and practical manu- als also finding their place amidst the fiction."27 After making these rather general observations about the character of kanazdshi as a whole, Lane devotes much of his essay to a close analysis of selected texts, discussing their contents and often their bibliographic features as well.28 Despite the many footnotes referring to titles in addition to those examined in the body of his essay, what Lane offers in practice is a compact "canon," consisting of those A similar view is shared by Fujii Otoo who affirms that kanazdshi are popular ( tsuzokuteki didactic ( kyokunteki ffclW W), and enlightening ( keimoteki ) in their nature ( honshitsu $ K), and that these characteristics differentiate them from other genres (e.g., ukiyozoshi , which are realistic and recreational, and yomihon which are biographical and idealistic). See Fujii 1934, p. 205. Tsugita Jun #cEBi0 argues that what distinguishes otogizdshi from kanazdshi is that the former are written for entertainment and the latter for enlightenment. See Tsugita 1936, p. 716. Similarly, Aoyama affirms that a didactic and enlightening nature can be seen as the hallmark of kanazdshi as a whole. See Aoyama 1966, p. 33. These views of the "nature" of kanazdshi , however, create a paradoxical situation, as they conflict with the need to restrict the analysis to shosetsu-like texts: the majority of works that do possess an enlightening or practical nature are, in fact, precisely those excluded from the literary histories as not being shosetsu-like. 23 Lane 1957a, p. 644. 24 Lane 1957a, p. 650. 25 Lane 1957a, p. 650. 26 Lane 1957a, pp. 650-51. 27 Lane 1957a, p. 652. 28 For this aspect of his study Lane relies on his extensive collection of Edo-period printed books, as I was able to establish when I visited part of the collection in Kyoto in August 2008. About Lanes collection, see Little 2005.</page><page sequence="9">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 305 texts that he considers worthy of being included in a history of literature. Here, too, Lane grounds his work in the orthodox view of kanazdshi among Japanese scholars and organizes the texts into three categories, namely, books written primarily to entertain, to 4 enlighten intellectually," and to "educate or inform in practical matters." Each category is further divided into subcategories (for example, love stories, super- natural tales, or parodies). The idea that the reader comes away with is that these categories constitute tidy boxes within the broader genre of kanazdshi and that each text has its proper place without any ambiguities: there appears to be no hybridity, no instability, no complexity of any sort. In constructing this neat and orderly canon, Lane chooses "realism" as the parameter by which to judge the literary value of each work and as the hallmark that characterizes all the texts discussed.29 This choice has profound implications: realism is what he praises as "new" and "literary" in Saikaku s mature prose, and to search for realism as the only valid criterion clearly implies that kanazdshi were to be considered solely in terms of their relationship to Saikaku s prose work, or, in other words, that they were to be subordinated to them.30 This approach contributes to an image of kanazdshi as a preparatory phase to the literary climax of the Genroku era, a group of works lacking any intrinsic identity of their own. It is astonishing that Lanes work on kanazdshi is still one of the very few Western studies of Japanese seventeenth -century prose literature available and certainly the only one to attempt a far-reaching analysis of this corpus of works as a whole.31 Presumably, the perception of kanazdshi as a "literature of transition," which has its origins in Japanese scholarship and is reflected in Lanes work, as well as the harsher judgment of Donald Keene,32 have not encouraged the pursuit of critical studies in this area. Despite the many attempts made in Japan, and reflected in Western scholarship, to depict the shosetsu-like kanazdshi genre in a simple and coherent way, there remain 29 Already in 1940 Kataoka Yoshikazu identified realism ( shajitsu shugi as the distinctive feature of early Edo-period literature and used it to discuss the path from kanazdshi , which to him was immature in this respect, to ukiyozoshi , which exhibited it to a fully developed degree. See Kataoka 1940, in particular, pp. 62-64. 30 Lane 1952 and Lane 1957b. 31 In the fairly comprehensive bibliography of English secondary sources provided in Shirane 2002, five titles on the subject of kanazdshi are listed, including mainly annotated translations of parts of specific texts. Additional sources are May 1973; May 1983; Elisonas 2001; Elisonas 2002; and Hor- ton 2001. 32 Keene 1976, pp. 149-66. In the rew pages that Keene devotes to kanazoshi he describes Urami no suke as having a "hackneyed plot" (p. 150), and he states that "the interest of most of the kana zoshi is nonliterary. . . . These snapshots of life in the early seventeenth century are equally interesting even if the style or language is inept. Indeed, when the kana zoshi are consciously liter- ary, as in the pastiche of classical phraseology of Uraminosuke , they tend to be almost comically tedious" (p. 155). Further, "we may be disappointed that Ryoi failed to make a novel out of his kana zoshi by maintaining a tone of anger against a society in which men are so cruelly treated, but we must not expect too much of a work intended primarily for entertainment" (p. 157).</page><page sequence="10">306 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) formidable difficulties created by the lack of genre hallmarks, by the arbitrary imposi- tion of chronological boundaries, and by the superimposition of an ideal image of the novel. The lack of genre hallmarks is all too apparent from the constant fluctuation in the number of works recognized as kanazoshi.We have far more than the forty titles rec- ognized by Mizutani in 1932, but we do not have a precise number accepted by all schol- ars. It is curious to note, for example, that in Kanazdshi kenkyu bunken mokuroku 'K which has become the standard reference for kanazdshi , 501 titles are listed, whereas in Kokusho somokuroku SlrltSii there are only 328.33 Moreover, the two lists do not match, for the former contains 290 titles that are not treated as kanazdshi in the latter, which in turn includes 214 titles labeled as kanazdshi that are not included in the former. This complete lack of a common view is confirmed by the choices made in Kanazdshi shusei a multivolume collection of texts that is not yet complete. Notwithstanding the commitment to exhaustiveness trum- peted in the foreword to each volume, in fact the work does not contain all the titles included in other reference materials, even Kanazdshi kenkyu bunken mokuroku , despite the same editor being involved in both publications.34 This is not so much a result of scholarly failings as of the aporia of a genre that lacks defining parameters. It is also due to the imposition at the beginning of the twentieth century of chrono- logical boundaries that were artificially fixed. Scholars have faced constant problems in deciding whether a text can be included in the kanazdshi genre on the basis of the date reported in the colophon or suggested by the bibliographic features of the book in cases where the contents and stylistic features suggest an earlier genesis, usually traceable to the Muromachi period. For example, Koizuka monogatari n is included as a kanazdshi in Kokusho somokuroku because of the existence of wood- block editions dating from the Meireki era (1655-1658), but it is not included in other reference materials because the theme is considered to be typical of Muromachi- period sensibilities.35 A similar quandary emerges when a work published after 1682 appears to be far from the tastes inaugurated by Saikakus prose and subsequently developed by the Hachimonjiya publishing house in the early eighteenth century. Much ink has been spilled in attempts to resolve the question of whether 33 See Fukasawa and Kikuchi 2004; and Kokusho somokuroku (of which there is also an updated version available online, Nihon kotenseki sogo mokuroku Hit). Donald H. Shively gives a different figure on the basis of a study by Akai Tatsuro "Although only 54 [kanazdshi] are known to have been printed by 1655, 178 appeared in the next eighteen years." Shively 1991, p. 730. 34 As claimed in the foreword, "the present Kanazdshi shusei series aims at including all kanazdshi in an exhaustive way (kanazdshi 0 morateki ni shuroku suru 0 mokuteki to shite &amp;Â£llÂ£$&lt;hL"t) and therefore offers transcriptions ( honkoku MM) of them. While a number of kanazdshi have already been transcribed, they do not amount to even half of all titles. This editorial project intends to promote the study of kanazdshi? The first editor in charge was Asakura Haruhiko at present the editing responsibility has shifted to Fukasawa Akio and his collaborators.

Challenged by these many difficulties, we must address some serious questions. The first is very simple, though of the utmost importance: Are kanazdshi really a lit- erary genre? Is it possible to define a genre notwithstanding a complete lack of spe- cific traits? Kanazdshi supporters may claim that the use of kana is the criterion, but can the use of kana be considered a genre characteristic only in the case of a group of texts written between 1600 and 1682, as has been uncritically stated from the time of Mizutani onward? And there is another essential question: Is it 4 convenient" to keep such a genre artificially alive, in the absence of genre features and without any attempt to historicize it as the creation of a Meiji-period scholar?36 More than a few have real- ized the circularity of this procedure and the inadequacy of the term kanazdshi ,37 At the same time, more than a few have emphasized that the category of kanazdshi must be considered to be a modern hoben or an expedient means or "convenience," that should not be abandoned. It is not clear, though, what the real convenience is, except as a label that has become part of the standard language in Japanese literary histories. Is it truly advisable to maintain a genre label that does not refer to a real genre? Is it truly advisable to encourage the existence of a label that forces scholars to belabor the issue of deciding whether a work belongs to this genre or not? In other words, is it worth upholding a problematic genre simply because it is more expedient to do so than to envisage a complete revision? As Antoine Compagnon reminds us, genres have both a heuristic and a constituent (or intrinsic) function.38 When we postulate the existence of genres, we imply that readers develop a whole horizon of attendant expectations and that their reception of a text as well as their discovery of its meaning is "genre-bound." At the same time, we imply that the author is aware of these boundaries and features. If we identify kanazdshi as a genre, we must expect that there were writers who were producing texts in full awareness of that identity and that readers had specific expectations before reading such texts. Once, however, we have recognized that the term kanazdshi was 36 In writing about the production of medical texts during the Renaissance, Maurizio Rippa Bonati notes that Tanacronismo e il peggiore degli errori nel quale pud cadere chiunque intenda comprendere il passato" (anachronism is the worst of the mistakes that one can make when trying to comprehend the past). Bonati 2003, p. 133. Similarly, in discussing Chinese categories such as xiaoshuo /Mft, chuanqi and zhi guai and their historical development, Glen Dudbridge points out that "we should be aware of the temporality of the literary space we inhabit." Dudbridge 2005, p. 14. 37 See, for example, Kondo 1938, p. 90; Teruoka 1940, p. 37 (which calls the label kanazdshi ambiguous and vague); Teruoka 1958, p. 4 (which once more argues that the label is vague, on the grounds that it is based not on content but on the stylistic characteristic of being written in kana); Noda 1969, pp. 312-13; Noda 1978, pp. 8-11; Tanaka 1974, p. 9; and Noma 1979 (which points out the necessity of revising the definition of kanazdshi by going back to its historical etymology). 38 Compagnon 2001.</page><page sequence="12">308 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) nothing more than a general label for texts written in Japanese and acknowledged the complete lack of genre hallmarks, it is clear that the genre kanazdshi is a chimera that owes its origin to a Procrustean framework devised in the Meiji period that has there- after been uncritically accepted by both Japanese and Western scholars. To keep this genre alive just for the sake of convenience not only creates the problems discussed above, but it also stands in the way of an objective view of what literary production really was in the seventeenth century, since it nourishes sterile prejudices and pre- conceptions. If we now move to the putative identification of kanazdshi as "novels," we find ourselves facing other challenging issues. Certain questions need to be addressed if we are to revise our views of prose production in seventeenth-century Japan. Was there in the seventeenth century any awareness of, or even need for, a form of writing that pos- sessed those characteristics that we look for in novels? If we consider kanazdshi to be "literature," do we not need to historicize the concept of literature itself?39 Why should we be troubled by the idea of a literature that includes nonnarrative forms? Is it not true that in European literary history many works, including medical, religious, culinary, and alchemical treatises, travel guidebooks, almanacs, books of prayer, and more, are considered to be "literature" without being forms of narrative?40 In our discussion of these questions we need to move away from the preconceptions nourished by the scholarship on kanazdshi to date. I suggest that we abandon the false convenience of believing in a genre of novels named kanazdshi developed between 1600 and 1682 and place ourselves again at the beginning of the Edo period within the "forest of books" that appeared at that point in Japanese cultural history. Did the word kanazdshi exist then? If so, what did it refer to? This will be the starting point of the second stage in our quest. Beyond Anachronism: Kana Booklets in the Seventeenth Century As Mizutani himself noted, the word kanazdshi was actually already in use in the seventeenth century.41 To understand its meaning then, it is useful to note a study by 39 Suzuki Sadami tries to demonstrate how the concepts of both "literature" and "bungaku" have changed from epoch to epoch and affirms that "there is no other option but to look into the history of 'bungaku.' To do so is to remove the blinkers of convention, to which we have grown so accus- tomed that we no longer notice them." Suzuki 2006, p. 15. 40 1 refer to the studies of chapbooks, of the Bibliotheque bleue (an extended group of popular books published in France from the seventeenth century and distributed in the countryside by peddlers), and, in general, of the origins of popular literature in Europe. See Andries and Bolleme 2003; Brooks 2003; Burke 1994; Cowan and Paterson 2007; Harvey 1903; Kobayashi 2007; Mandrou 1999; McKay 2003; Neuburg 1977; Spufford 1985; Watt 1991; and Weiss 1969. 41 Suzuki Sadami observes, "The history of words shows that when a word used in the past looks the same as one employed nowadays, we fail to notice that its meaning has changed and misread it by projecting our own assumptions onto it; or we ignore it just because it disagrees with them" Suzuki 2006, p. 25. Therefore it is crucial to retrieve the meaning that such a word originally pos- sessed.</page><page sequence="13">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 309 Ichiko Teiji published in 1944, on the basis of an earlier survey by Fujii Otoo made in 1934.42 Citing twenty-six passages taken from primary sources dat- ing from 1468 up to 1849, Ichiko demonstrates that the word kanazdshi has a long history, but that its meaning originally was nothing more than "a booklet written in kana" (in other words, written in Japanese in a mixture of kana and kanji often glossed with furigana).43 Thus it could be, and was, used generically to denote works containing texts that we now consider to belong to quite different genres, including Heian monogatari,44 ukiyozoshi , topographical works (i.e., the guidebooks known as meishoki ^0ffS), and books of moral precepts or of general instruction. Edo-period sources provide further clues to the meaning of kanazdshi at that time. A significant example can be found in the preface to Saikakus posthumous work, Saikaku oritome , which was edited by Hojo Dansui in 1694. Dansui wrote, "Among the plethora of kanazdshi written by Saikaku during his life - so numer- ous that they could be used to make a roof and, if put on a carriage, they would cause the ox to sweat - there are three works, entitled Nippon eitaigura Honcho chonin kagami A$Â£, and Yo no hitogokoro . . . "45 What is striking here is that Dansui describes Saikaku s entire prose oeuvre as kanazdshi. The perceived equivalence between kanazdshi and the prose of Saikaku or Saikaku s contemporaries is further evident in a later work entitled Genroku taiheiki IS, written by Miyako no Nishiki f I lCD$$ in 1702.46 This text employs a narrative frame in which two fictional booksellers, one from Osaka and the other from Kyoto, meet on a boat. Apart from a long, embedded fictional narrative about Saikaku s oneiric journey to hell, it consists of a nonnarrative dialogue in which the contemporary pan- orama of literature and publishing is put under scrutiny. The two fictional booksellers debate who is the more gifted writer, Saikaku or Miyako no Nishiki; they exchange opinions about individual works, groups of texts, and authors; and they talk about the economic enterprise of publishing and bookselling. In this firsthand journey into the culture of the book in the Kamigata region at the very beginning of the eighteenth century, the word kanazdshi is used at various junctures. At the end of the first volume (1:17a), the Osaka bookseller affirms that "as regards kanazdshi , no one surpasses the Osaka writers"; as examples to sustain this statement he refers to Saikaku s work against that of Miyako no Nishiki and Nishizawa Kyuzaemon (otherwise known 42 Ichiko 1944; and Fujii 1934, in particular, pp. 202-205. 43 It is worth noting also that the stylistic feature that Mizutani claims as distinguishing pre- and post- Saikaku texts, namely, the mixture of kana and kanji (provided with furigana), is actually characteristic of most texts printed from the Kanbun era onward and becomes a feature of the majority of texts printed for mass consumption. 44 Note that the Heian monogatari may once have constituted a courtly literature for a closed public, but in the seventeenth century these tales underwent a process of canonization and diffu- sion. On this subject see Kornicki 2005; Mostow 2003; and Mostow 2004. 45 Preface, Saikaku oritome , i:2a-b. 46 Genroku taiheiki.</page><page sequence="14">310 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) as Nishizawa Ippu In this case once more, the word kanazdshi is applied to what critics today would refer to as ukiyozoshi, a perspective maintained later in the text (5:9a) when the Kyoto bookseller speaks about what makes a good kanazdshi. Genroku taiheiki , though, goes beyond the simple use of the word kanazdshi and gives us other useful information to suggest the expectations raised by texts written in kana. Speaking about divination texts, the author puts the following words in the mouth of a man who is sitting in the boat with the booksellers: "These texts [writ- ten in kanbun] do not appeal to beginners eyes ( shoshin no me ^L^g). It would be precious to have good commentaries in hiragana that simply soften the text, that can be read to the illiterate, and that can be understood as they are even by women and children" (6:11b). Implicit in this passage is the understanding that kanazdshi are booklets written in kana so as to make them accessible to everyone. This connection between kana usage and accessibility remained a constant throughout the Edo period, as many sources show. For example, in the preface to Yamato izenroku (1713, written by Fujii Raisai the author explains his decision to write in kana: "as I feared that the lowborn people ( iyashiki v who live in the cities or in the countryside might not understand [these sto- ries] in their original format of Chinese text, I turned them into Japanese ( wago Ip) and illustrated them with pictures."47 Similarly, in the frontispiece ( mikaeshi ;Â§L) of Nichiren shonin ichidaiki BH-h (1858) it is stated that "this text has been written in hiragana [Japanese] and illustrations have been inserted so that it is understandable even to children."48 Again in the frontispiece of the 1800 edition of Ojoyoshu A, it is explained that "this text has softened Eshin's teachings by putting them in hiragana [Japanese] and by inserting illustrations so that even nuns of low social status can read it."49 In a copy of Jitsugokyo sho ^fp fit#,50 we find a list of texts advertised at the end of the book, and among them is Hitogotogusa (the first part published in 1796 and the second in 1802), introduced with a descrip- tion informing the reader that "in order to make it easily understandable for those who have rustic manners ( rizoku this text puts into hiragana facts taught in the past by wise men and sages and makes them interesting thanks to the introduction of illustrations." In the advertisement for the publication of the second volume of Chiyo no jigatame (1789), the editor points out that "this text is in hiragana and gives details about improvements made by the benevolent government, and it is a book of instruction accessible even to children."51 Potentially infinite examples could be given, which lead to the conclusion that kanazdshi was not a specific term for any literary genre, but rather a broad term for texts that were written in Japanese in a mixture of kana and kanji (generally with 47 Yamato izenroku , 1:2b. 48 Nichiren shonin ichidaiki. 49 Ojoyoshu. 50 Jitsugokyo sho. 51 Chiyo no jigatame, 20b.</page><page sequence="15">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 311 furigana added) so that they could speak to everyone, with no distinction in gender, social background, or age. The use of kana certainly functions as a "marker," but not as one signifying a literary genre. It is a marker telling us that the text is intended to be simple, accessible to any person who can read hiragana, and, therefore, suitable for "enlightening" the "masses."52 It tells us that the text speaks to a popular read- ership, and I would like to make it clear that by the word "popular" I refer both to a quantitative aspect- a vast circulation overall53 - and a qualitative one potentially including even the lowest classes.54 The word "kana" is a marker that creates a dichot- omy between two groups of texts - but not two genres: on the one hand, those writ- ten in kana (characterized by the aforementioned aspects) and, on the other hand, those written predominantly or solely in kanji (i.e., works in kanbun or kanbun with kunten flL^Q- Just such a dichotomy was made in the shojaku mokuroku Irilgii (booksell- ers' catalogues) of the time, showing publishers and booksellers were fully aware of it.55 The titles listed in the catalogues are divided into categories, but two dif- ferent calligraphic styles can be found: some titles belonging to certain categories are written in kaisho fit#, and some others, belonging to other categories, are written in sosho ^(r. As we shall see in greater detail in due course, this stylistic distinction accounts for perceived differences in contents and, therefore, in book categories - namely, a difference between works related to the elitist sphere of kan- bun texts and works addressing a wider readership.56 Similarly, in the catalogues using an iroha sequence and subsequently divided into only a few basic categories, Confucian works (jusho fR#), medical treatises ( isho IS#), and Buddhist books ( bussho fA#) are kept divided from all the other books written in kana (which are referred to simply as "kana" Moreover, the first three categories maintain the use of kaisho to record book titles, whereas the kana category uses the sosho style. Kanazdshi can therefore be usefully compared to all those texts that we define as "vernacular" in other traditions. Vernacular texts developed in different European cultures as an alternative to texts in Latin, in China in antithesis to works in classical 52Ichiko 1944, p. 96.

Lise Andries argues in her study of the Bibliotheque bleue that it is dangerous to speak of a "popular culture" because that may suggest a binary opposition between popular and elite culture, whereas, in fact, there is much osmosis between the two. Therefore I use the word "popular" here in the meaning of "larger diffusion" suggested and accepted by Andries herself. See Andries and Bolleme 2003. 55 For an introduction to the shojaku mokuroku see Abe Ryuichi's kaisetsu in Shido Bunko 1962-1964; and Kornicki 1998, pp. 176-77, 429-32. 56 Something similar can be observed in some of the booksellers' catalogues ( catalogi librorum) published in Europe during the fifteenth century. Luigi Balsamo points out that in these catalogues the titles were written either in the Roman or in the Gothic script, mirroring the style used in the whole text and, therefore, allowing the buyer to foresee the different degrees of readability of the book. See Balsamo 1984, pp. 47-48.</page><page sequence="16">312 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) Chinese, and in Japan, similarly, as an alternative to texts in kanbun.57 Thus the best translation for kanazdshi is indeed "books in the vernacular," with the specific nuance of being "popular": it is not a literary genre but rather a huge mass of texts that were written so that potentially everyone could read them. In this regard kanazdshi can be compared to what H. S. Bennett called "lit- erary wares" in the English book trade in the period from 1475 to 1557. 58 William Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, and Richard Pynson were committed to producing books intended for a general audience using vernacular English and not Latin. They included both narrative and nonnarrative texts, texts that exploited the potentialities of both fiction and nonfiction and were loosely divided into cat- egories such as religion, law, education, medicine, popular science, geography, history, and fiction.59 Other plausible parallels are the corpus of texts contained in the Bibliotheque bleue in France from the seventeenth century onward and the English and Scottish chapbooks produced in the same period.60 In Japan as elsewhere, the marketing of books to an ever larger audience led to the growth of vernacular pub- lishing, which constituted a "literature (in print) for the people" and which would progressively evolve into a "literature of the people."61 Once this correspondence between kanazdshi and books in the vernacular for a popular readership is acknowledged, the debate over many of the problems that have 57 David D. Hall affirms that "in some sense books in Latin bespoke a separate culture. But as translations multiplied in the late sixteenth century, and as the classics were redacted in popular formats, Latin lost most of its significance as a carrier of ideas or as a cultural code." Hall 1996, p. 85. Even though it would be dangerous to argue similarly that kanbun lost its cultural significance after books in kana found their place in the Japanese publishing market, we can find a strong equivalence in the couplings of Latin books/vernacular books and kanbun books/books in kana. For a comparison of kanbun and Latin see Mizumura 2008. 58 Bennett 1969; and Feather 2006, pp. 20-21. 59 See also Hotchkiss and Robinson 2008. 60 See note 40. Leon M. Zolbrod draws an analogy between the genre of kusazdshi of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and chapbooks on the basis of their bibliographic formats (see Zolbrod 1968), and a similar point is made by Kimura Yaeko Tfc+t AJt-f (see Kimura 2009). Even though such a correspondence is undeniable, the range of narrativity (some wholly narrative, as in the case of the majority of kusazdshi , and others nonnarrative or mixed) of the popular texts printed at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the variety of books and disciplines covered, and the "usefulness" of these texts made possible by their printing all suggest an even stronger similarity between the texts considered here and the vast production of chapbooks. It is also worth noting that even though most known European chapbooks have formats of octavo or duodecimo size with eight pages, recent studies on chapbooks have shown that during the seventeenth century these formats were actually far from being standard, with, for example, some texts printed in the larger quarto size with twenty- four pages and histories in particular in a range of thirty- two to seventy-two pages. For details see Spufford 1985, p. 50; Cavallo and Chartier 1995, p. 323 (also the English translation, Cavallo and Chartier 2003, p. 274); and the sizes indicated in the chapbooks digitalized in the Nesbitt Chapbook Collection. 61 This distinction is made by David D. Hall about the Bibliotheque bleue and chapbooks. See Hall 1996, pp. 48-49.</page><page sequence="17">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 313 been occupying the scholarly world in connection with kanazdshi is resolved. The anxiety over whether this is literature or not is removed, since we apply a larger defi- nition of literature as a realm that includes "every work which is alive' by being in phase with one or more . . . groups of readers."62 At the same time we would no longer question whether only "novels' should be included, because we are well aware of the literary territory where the novel, in the restricted meaning of the term, did not exist yet (even in the West).63 We also do not need to make any choice between narra- tive and nonnarrative, since what characterizes these vernacular texts meant to be read by a larger public is their ability not only to entertain readers but also to provide them with useful and didactic content - an aspect that I shall examine further below. Finally, we begin to see clearly a continuum in which such popular prose in the ver- nacular developed from the Muromachi period onward up to the beginning of the Meiji period. Working within that continuum, the focus of our attention here will be to understand what happened to this popular vernacular prose once it was put into print. Having identified the significance of the word kanazdshi in the Edo period, let us try to address another question: Should all texts written and printed in kana in the early Edo period be included in our examination of popular vernacular prose? Here I shall draw a distinction between vernacular books produced in the Kamigata region and those produced in Edo. Those printed in the area around Kyoto will constitute the core of my survey, since they best show the features discussed so far. This core of texts roughly corresponds to what in the field of Japanese descriptive bibliography is known as mono no hon $)(D^.64 On the other hand, the kana books primarily con- ceived as amusement for children and published in Edo from the Kanbun era onward (known in the Edo period as akahon and their later offshoots, will not be part of my analysis.65 This is because these prose texts, despite the fact that they cer- tainly constitute popular prose in the vernacular, were conceived as different from those printed in the Kamigata region by the publishers of the Edo period them- selves and because they respond to a different generic logic. Together with joruri and kabuki texts, in fact, akahon and later kusazoshi were named jihon and seen as "fashionable" literature for a "metropolitan" audience. Despite the fact that the boundaries between mono no hon and jihon turn out to be less clear-cut when we study the migration of texts from one bibliographic world to another, what I want to establish here is that the group of texts that constitute the object of my inquiry is the mass of printed books that Japan began to produce mainly in the Kamigata region from the Keicho era onward. 62 Definition given by George McFadden.

What did printed books, and particularly "vernacular books" in print, consist of at the time? Was there any genre consciousness that we can identify? Were there any perceived distinctions of kind? Was there a hierarchy of books? To answer these questions, the primary sources must be our recourse, and two methods suggest themselves. One is the close reading of primary sources, which I shall take up below in selected case studies.66 The other is the "distant reading" defined by Franco Moretti as reading that "allows us to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes- or genres and systems."67 How, then, can we orient ourselves in the "forest of books" that flourished at the beginning of the seventeenth century? Among the tools that we can make use of are booksellers catalogues, which were issued in the second half of the seventeenth century.68 Though produced for commercial purposes, not bibliographic or literary, they afford an invaluable entree to the seventeenth-century world of books as seen by people of that time. Let us begin with the first relevant catalogue, one published anonymously in the Kanbun era, probably sometime during the period 1667-1669. Almost two thousand seven hundred titles are listed in twenty-two categories, and a primary division is identifiable on the basis of the aforementioned difference in the two calligraphic styles used for the titles (i.e., kaisho and sosho). The kaisho style 66 Cf. the method suggested by Margaret Cohen for literature hors d'usage : "Close reading, as it is generally practised, depends on a naturalized set of aesthetic expectations derived precisely from a history of reading the works that have not fallen out of circulation. The great challenge confronting any excavation is to denaturalize these expectations and take forgotten literature on its own terms. What is a works ideological force? Without understanding that forgotten works are shaped by a coherent, if now lost, aesthetics, one simply dismisses them as uninteresting or infe- rior in terms of the aesthetics that have won out." Cohen 1999, p. 21. 67 Moretti 2000a and Moretti 2005. 1 am applying here Franco Moretti's definition of distant reading in a manner that might be judged naive, and which certainly is pragmatic, since I am not renouncing the close reading of the texts and I am not embracing Moretti's most radical position, according to which "if, between the very small and the very large, the text itself disappears, well, it is one of those cases when one can justifiably say, Less is more" (Moretti 2000a, pp. 57-58). 68 The first shojaku mokuroku ( Shinpan shojaku mokuroku kept in manuscript form at the Kanchiin tHH? of Toji is actually dated 1659, but I shall not consider it here since it is a simple list of titles devoid of any clear division into categories. For the main shojaku moku- roku see the facsimiles in Shido Bunko 1962-1964. Those analyzed here are of a type that arrange titles into distinct categories (in contrast to others that simply list titles in iroha sequence with a rough division between Confucian books, Buddhist books, medical books, and kana books): the catalogue dated to 1667-1669, which has no colophon; the 1670 catalogue published in Kyoto by Nishimura Matazaemon and in Edo by Nishimura Mataemon WtXGitrF1!; the 1671 catalogue published in Kyoto by Yamada Ichirohei (possibly Ichirobei) the 1675 catalogue published in Kyoto by Mori Monhachi (possibly Bunhachi) ^ the 1685 catalogue published in Kyoto by Nishimura Ichiroemon MttTfT et al.; the catalogues of 1692, 1699, 1729, and 1754 published in Kyoto by Nagata Chohei (possibly Chobei) et al; and the 1772 catalogue published in Kyoto by Takemura Shinpei (possibly Shinbei) Kftff</page><page sequence="19">Moretti: Kanazoshi Revisited 315 Kyo #1 Sutras Tendai narabi Toshu Hosso Risshu Wtt.

It has been suggested that the distinction between kanbun texts and poetry on the one hand and other prose texts in the vernacular on the other hand might have been perceived not merely as a typological distinction, but also as a hierarchical one (i.e., "elite books" vs. "popular books").70 For this reason, in my analysis I shall take into account only the last two categories, washo narabi kanarui and mai narabi soshi. The group named washo narabi kanarui appears to be a huge melting pot where different kinds of texts are arbitrarily put together and where no distinctions are made: historical chronicles, arithmetic manuals (fourteen titles, starting with the famous Jinkoki JSSJjffi), handbooks for board games (a total of nine titles including those for both go S and shogi #^), four recipe books, twenty-six titles dealing with the noh tradition, four guidebooks for travelers, four guides to etiquette (mainly addressed to women), Buddhist tracts in Japanese and mostly in dialogue form (twenty-seven titles), moral books for women, designs for kimono ( hinagatabon Â§t?F^ ^), texts dealing in a more or less rigorous way with Confucianism, a few jestbooks (among them the well-known Seisuisho SIBi^), four titles dealing with Yoshiwara l=f JÂ® (including courtesan critiques like Yoshiwara tokoiri or Yoshiwara kasen pf Â®â¬Hlll), inventories of things (inscriptions on swords, seals, etc.), books containing kyoka, and, at the end, a large group of texts that are absolutely eclectic in their contents. In this last group we find, for example, the Japanese adaptation of Aesop's fables ( Isoho monogatari as well as a chronicle of the fam- ine that struck Japan from 1634 to 1642 ( Yakushi tsuya monogatari the first guidebook to Kyoto, Kyo warabe mm; and an anthology of fictional tales unified by the protagonist Hyotaro, Ukiyo monogatari Thus washo and kanarui were terms that admitted a great variety of texts with no further subcat- egorization and no distinction between fiction and nonfiction or between narrative and nonnarrative. As a whole what is striking here is, in the first place, the extreme variety of the printed matter included in this group, variety in terms of contents, of textual func- tion, and of narrative/nonnarrative nature. This variety is one of the features that characterize the evolution of popular vernacular prose in print not only in Japan but also in Europe, as shown by recent studies of European popular literature, mainly 70Nakamura Yukihiko has drawn a distinction between a "primary art" (dai ichi bungei i^), including traditional literature (which he defines also as ga bungaku such as waka, kanshi .yokyoku Isffi (noh texts), and the traditional monogatari, and a "secondary art" (dai ni bungei made up of those genres originating in the Edo period, such as haikai, kyoka, joruri, and kabuki, as well as a variety of new prose genres (identified as zoku bungaku ^X^). See Nakamura 1982-1989, vol. 3, pp. 51-52. This hierarchy has become standard (see, for example, Suzuki 2006, pp. 70-71, 115, 217).</page><page sequence="21">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 317 chapbooks and the Bibliotheque bleue.71 What also emerges from the contents of the washo narabi kanarui category is a taste for books that are not simply entertaining but also in many ways "useful." The concept "useful," for our purposes, is that defined by Genevieve Bolleme in relation to the Bibliotheque bleue : it has both the meaning of something practically useful in daily life and that of something offering people secu- lar, religious, or moral knowledge.72 Therefore this mass of popular literature in prose is constituted in part by what Berry has defined as the "library of public information," and, at the same time, it shows how the boundaries of this "library" even exceed the categories (or genres) studied by Berry, which included such texts as maps, rosters (bukan JWE), and guidebooks. What about the second grouping, that of mai narabi soshi ? Unlike with the previous category, here a distinction is made between mai ( kowakamai texts and soshi . Thirty-six titles are listed together and followed by the words "in total thirty-six books of mai ," indicating that this constituted a distinct and almost fixed subcategory.73 When we shift to the soshi subsection, we notice that no distinction whatsoever between pre-Edo and seventeenth-century texts is made and that narrative texts and nonnarra- tive texts are, once more, intermingled. In nineteen of the titles, the word honji ^ appears, and they are in fact examples of that type of narrative structure known today as honjimono Many tales were composed for the first time in the Muromachi period and then put into print in the Edo period: the list includes many titles of works now known as otogizoshi , such as Karaito Shuten doji S#m-F, Saru Genji soshi , Junidanzoshi (today more commonly known as Joruri junidanzoshi ), and Hachikazuki At the same time, books newly com- posed in the Edo period, such as Chikusai Urami no suke t, Usuyuki Sit (better known as Usuyuki monogatari Zeraku monogatari I#, and Wakashu monogatari are also given under mai narabi soshi. A large space is then occupied by critiques of kabuki actors (now known as yakusha 71 Cf. Mandrou 1999 and Weiss 1969 (both divided into sections corresponding to different types of content); Spufford 1985, in particular, pp. 133-47; Neuburg 1964, pp. 6-7; and Neuburg 1977. See also the textual categories proposed in the subject index of the Nesbitt Chapbook Collection. 72 Bolleme 2003. 73 This was an established category throughout most of the Edo period, constituting a genre in itself. In his Gunsho ichiran K (1801), for example, Ozaki Masayoshi includes an entry for mai no hon if describing them as "books including text and music (fuhon If $) of dances (mai) of the medieval and old times ( chuko ^"i)." He then gives a brief history of the genre and some stylistic features, listing thirty-six titles almost perfectly matching those included in the shojaku mokuroku from the Kanbun era onward (the only nonmatching titles are Kamata frttz and Izumi ga shiro which are replaced by Yume awase and Tsurugi sandan f?!l ISP1 in Gunsho ichiran). See Gunsho ichiran, 3:74a-b. Currently mai no hon , or mai no soshi , are better known as kowakamai. 74 Present in different Muromachi-period and Edo-period texts (namely, Muromachi mono- gatari, kojoruri 'Nf-igJS, and sekkyo joruri this narrative structure involves a deity's</page><page sequence="22">318 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) hydbanki including Yard sen IffilHtl] and Yard mushi and cri- tiques of courtesans as well as guidebooks to the pleasure quarters, such as Naniwa monogatari ItrM^Jfp and Shimabara shu Interestingly enough, included in the same list is a book presumably dealing with Christianity and titled Deusu mondo X ilrfcm.75 What is the difference between washo narabi kanarui and mai narabi soshi ? Nakano Mitsutoshi has suggested that the former includes more texts that have a practical or enlightening character and the latter more "literary" texts,76 but such a distinction looks somewhat feeble when we notice that some purely literary texts such as Nise monogatari Hp or jestbooks are in the former category, while some morally edifying texts such as Onnajingi monogatari i%fp are included in the latter. What this shows us, surely, is that around 1670 no single genre within the melting pot of popular prose literature in the vernacular had yet been recognized, that there was no perception of a "new" literature distinguished from that of the Muromachi period, and that there was no division between fictional/nonfictional or narrative/nonnarrative texts. There were indeed distinctions between books in Chinese and Japanese and between poetry and prose, but there were no distinc- tions drawn within the vast field of popular prose.77 What happened to these two categories after 1669? As regards washo narabi kanarui , in the catalogue published in 1670 jointly by the Edo publisher Nishimura Mataemon and the Kyoto publisher Nishimura Matazaemon we perceive an increasing desire to untangle and to impose order on the titles earlier included in this category. Washo narabi kanarui was renamed kana washo with a subtitle identifying the contents as "books on the five virtues {gojosho S##), books on filial piety (kokosho HO, books on shingaku 'L^, and educational books (kyokunsho ifclM#)." The renaming went hand in hand with the removal of texts that were not imbued with the ethical dimensions implied in the subtitle. Expung- ing them required the creation of new categories, where these texts were grouped according to a common element. As illustrated in figure 2, this led to the emergence of specific and independent categories that, in conceptual terms, remained fairly consistent until 1772, although their names underwent numerous changes: texts for women, including texts teaching calligraphy to women ( nyosho ^Clr, nyosho narabi tehonrui nyosho narabi nyohitsu noh texts, often includ- ing books of music ( utaibon utaibon narabi itotakesho utaibon/ itotakeshoy utaisho IS#, shikyoku narabi utai manuals of arithmetic (sansho becoming manifest in the human world, experiencing the same passions as human beings, and developing the will to help men turn back into divine form. 75 Kokusho somokuroku attributes it to Suzuki Shosan. No copies are known to be extant today. 76 Nakano 1995, p. 104. 77 For some titles such as Nendaiki or Toin hiji the original kanbun version is included in the category kana narabi washo together with the counterpart in Japanese, but these are rare and special cases.</page><page sequence="23">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 319 -d Vh Â£ c O o IX 'D 6 o &lt;-Â£ CO &lt;D 3 OG O cd u "c/5 S-H JU &lt;75 o o _c &lt;u c/3 3 C/3 .U "C o OX) &lt;U cd o T3 a&gt; t&gt; jd c/5 &lt;+h O C o "o w ri &lt;u u 3 bp Â£ â Â§ - o Â§ 1 0 '3 ol Â§L |S 3 Â» jf&gt;.g -c ,0;^ ^ Â«is â¢Â§ s (N Â§L Â© 3 -c -c _ ^ Â«is ^ (N ^ Â§L Â© -c 1 ^ | _ J: I ,s Â«is .! s | Â§3 i ^ ^-Â§ 5 Â§ c? $ 3 O i â¢Â© Â«s&gt; .fc g Â§3 1 5 10 8 Â§ c?

In later catalogues, new titles were sometimes added to the original core, while titles of texts no longer in print, out of fashion, or perceived as belonging to a different genre were occasionally dropped or moved from one cat- egory to another - demonstrating the existence of perceived genres in the realm of the popular book. These entities, which we may name "historical genres," made their appearance in the seventeenth century, were consciously perceived as distinct, at least by the publishing world, and continued to develop throughout the Edo period. I shall return to these historical genres later. What happened, meanwhile, to the category of mai narabi soshi ? Up to 1685 it was maintained intact (with the small variation of using the expression maihon instead of simply mai); there was little change except for the addition of some erotic works in the soshi section. In the 1685 catalogue, however, a significant change took place with the addition of two new categories named, respectively, monogatarisho and koshoku narabi rakuji The majority of the titles previously included in the soshi subcategory were transferred to monogatarisho. With only a few exceptions, the distinction between the two seems not to have been grounded on genre issues, but rather on the simple inclusion in the title of the word soshi or monogatari. Moreover, even at this stage, in neither of these categories was any dis- tinction made between Muromachi tales and texts of the seventeenth century, let alone between works coming before or after Saikaku s Koshoku ichidai otoko. The implications are worth pondering. Currently, for example, most scholars con- sider Otogi boko (1 666) and Zoku Otogi boko (Kanbun era) to belong to a different genre from Shin Otogi boko WMilNbQ-f (1683) merely because of their dates of composition - the first two are considered kanazoshi and the third an ukiyozoshi. In the 1685 catalogue, however, all three works were included under monogatarisho. While this certainly alerts us to the artificiality of current genre distinctions, above all it also suggests that we should consider these three texts as belonging to a common literary form, namely, that of anthologies of short stories about supernatural events based on Chinese legends. It is because of this new lens that a common generic thread running through these texts becomes visible and that,</page><page sequence="25">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 321 at the same time, we can detect what changed over time in works that belong to a common group of texts. As regards koshoku narabi rakuji , all texts including in the title the word koshoku - still few in number, as the fashion had been inaugurated only a few years earlier with Saikaku s works - were listed here, as were texts dealing with the pleasure quarters and with the kabuki theater, which means that some of the texts originally included under mai narabi soshi were moved here as well. It is interesting to note that some shunpon (erotic writings) were also included in this category. The division between soshi and monogatari is maintained in the catalogue of 1692. Here it is interesting to note that some texts written by Saikaku- for example Saikaku banashi (a variant title for Saikaku shokoku banashi SKi &amp;L) and Wankyu MA (a variant title for Wankyu isse no monogatari Hp)- were included in the monogatarisho section together with other pre-Saikaku texts.78 On the other hand, Koshoku ichidai otoko and Koshoku ichidai onna ~k were grouped with koshoku narabi rakuji. This indicates that texts now considered to be similar in their literary nature, such as those we would today call ukiyozoshi , were in fact thought to belong to different textual groups and, therefore, repre- sented different literary forms in the Edo period. The contrary is true as well: texts that we now consider to belong to different genres- i.e., otogizoshi , kanazdshi , and ukiyozoshi - were in fact perceived to be of the same category and of a similar literary form. The monogatarisho category in the end remained unstable, for in the 1699 catalogue it disappeared and some of the titles previously included here were reabsorbed into the soshi group, and again new titles by Saikaku, such as Seken munesanyo Eitaigura zlcft/K (a variant title for Nippon eitaigura ), and Budo denraiki were added. In this evolution of mai narabi soshi , it is certainly possible to perceive from 1685 an attempt to allow a further division of books. Nonetheless, the categories are left too undefined to enable us to recognize in them any "genre," as was possible in the evolution of washo narabi kanarui. In 1729 the panorama is subjected to a significant change. Although the number of categories in the catalogue published that year is substantially higher than the twenty-two seen in the first catalogue discussed,79 in the 1729 publication there are no more kana washo , mai narabi soshi , or monogatarisho. We find that one new category, kanamono soshirui has taken their place.80 This name, in a way, merges the two previous categories, suggesting that the texts listed here were 78 This is a significant detail that has been disregarded in previous surveys of the shojaku moku- roku (in particular in Nakano 1995). 79 The number of categories changed over time as follows: there were thirty-six categories in 1670 and 1671, thirty-eight in 1675, forty-six in 1685 and 1692, forty-three in 1699, forty-one in 1729, and forty in 1754 and 1772. 80Dudbridge 2005 points out a similar instability and mutability in the case of the Chinese "classificatory thinking" (p. 197) conceived, for example, in the twelfth century by Zheng Qiao tl. Such thinking, Dudbridge noted, "shows how each of those titles was assigned to various cat- egories in imperial and private catalogues, early and late, and the results are so divergent that they suggest a randomness about the whole enterprise" (p. 195).</page><page sequence="26">322 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) considered to be part of the same tradition - in other words, that they belonged to the same world of popular vernacular literature that was formed at the beginning of the Edo period. But changes are visible in the contents of this new category: apart from texts such as Ukiyo monogatari and Shin Chikusai Sr ft all the works included here reflect the new literary trends that began to emerge after the Genroku era, and most are connected to Ejima Kiseki illlKiif or the Hachimonjiya publishing house. Another prominent difference in the 1729 catalogue is the disappearance of the category koshoku narabi rakuji , due to censorship imposed in the 1720s. It is not clear yet whether the disappearance of texts shown in earlier catalogues is due to inclusion of only newly printed texts- as the English "term catalogues" did from 1668 onward, albeit not comprehensively- or whether the 1729 catalogue actu- ally reflects a profound shift in literary tastes.81 In the two remaining catalogues of 1754 and 1772, even the category of kanamono soshirui disappears completely and new categories take its place, with shosetsu.furyu yomihon kidan pflfc, kyokun, and zassho making their first appearance. Further research is needed to clarify what relationship, if any, exists between these categories and those seen in previous catalogues. It is of course possible to supplement the data provided by the booksellers catalogues with evidence from other primary sources, such as other catalogues ( shomoku # @) produced in the Edo period, catalogues of the holdings of lending libraries ( kashihoriya $11), or works like Gunsho ruiju (1820, written by Hanawa Hokiichi Gozonji no shobaimono (1783, written by Santo Kyoden or Kinsei mono no hon Edo sakusha burui (1834, written by Kyokutei Bakin Nonetheless, for the purpose of the pres- ent study, the survey of booksellers catalogues given above affords us a direct view of prose production in the seventeenth century and of how it was perceived by the book trade. It is clear from this analysis that most of the terms used in modern histories of Japanese literature of the Muromachi and the Edo periods - e.g.,gunki monogatari Â¥ ISt/M, otogizoshU and ukiyozoshi - were nonexistent in the Edo period. I will, there- fore, avoid using these problematic terms and refer in general to Muromachi-period and Edo-period literary forms, texts, and prose. So how are we to make sense of the huge quantity of popular prose in the vernacular that was printed in seventeenth-century Japan? First of all, we need to identify all the titles that are part of this vast popular literature without any a priori exclusions or distinctions between texts based on such qualities as narrative or nonnarrative, fiction or nonfiction, entertaining, useful, or enlightening. Texts of all these types were characteristic of popular literature in print, and to disregard them is to impose anachronistic preconceptions. Our task is indeed a daunting one that requires corre- lation of the titles found in the booksellers' catalogues with modern bibliographic 81 The study of the Edo-period shojaku mokuroku is still in its initial phase, and many aspects await discovery and discussion. For the English term catalogues, see Aber 1905; and Feather 1988, p. 61.</page><page sequence="27">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 323 tools such as Kanazdshi kenkyu bunken mokuroku , Kokusho somokuroku , and Nihon kotenseki sogo mokuroku ft Hit In so as to identify those that were com- posed or published in the seventeenth century. Identifying the "great unread" texts of this crucial first century in the history of commercial print in Japan is obviously a long-term project, and at this juncture I will simply outline the parameters on the basis of which such a systematization of the "great unread" might be possible.82 It is obvious that any attempt at a typology or taxonomy must avoid the limitations that we have identified in the existing studies of kanazdshi. Since the object of our inquiry is popular literature in print, we must place it along a continuum that goes from the popular literature developed in the Muromachi period to the popular literature that began to appear in print at the beginning of the seven- teenth century. The first parameter to consider in bringing this mass of texts into some order has to do with narrative nature, for the corpus includes texts that are purely narrative, those that are purely nonnarrative, and hybrid combinations of the two.83 Recognizing this variety allows us to overcome both the usual Manichaean view that texts have to be either narrative or nonnarrative and the view held by some schol- ars of kanazdshi that every text has a "composite nature" of some kind.84 Moreover, it allows us to take into account one of the novelties that print brought to a popular litera- ture that had been transmitted in other forms until the end of the Muromachi period, that is, the inclusion of nonnarrative passages that were either independent and self-contained or intermingled with narrative elements as well as enclosed within a narrative structure. Print allowed popular prose to be enriched by adding a dimension of "useful" nonnarrative. The second parameter relates to the fictional character of the texts, again admitting three possible modulations: completely fictional, completely nonfictional, and a mix- ture of the two. Another parameter that must be applied is the structure of the text. On the basis of an empirical examination of a number of selected works, so far I have been able to identify the following types of structure: texts organized around a unitary plot, works with a "modular" structure akin to an anthology, Chinese-box structures with narrative or nonnarrative sections embedded within a larger frame, and dialogues. The final parameter to consider is the contents of the text: when there is a dominant theme taken up by a text, that may be significant for detecting a common 82 See Cohen 1999 and Moretti 2000b for a similar methodological approach in the study of Western literature. 83 See note 5 for the definition of "narrative" used in the present study. 84 Against the rigid classifications of kanazdshi elaborated to date (see note 86), the insistence since the early Showa period has been on making the genre work by affirming that there are also exceptions, such as texts that admit of a double or a triple function. This recognition has led some scholars to the opposite extreme, that of declaring that multifariousness (tayosei #Â£S14), compos- ite nature (fukugosei Wii 14), and miscellaneous character ( zattasei 34 #14) must be recognized as features of all kanazdshi. In other words, they see these characteristics as hallmarks of kanazdshi as a genre, an interpretation that is denied by the analysis of primary sources. See, for example, Mizuta 1981 and Fukuda 1996.</page><page sequence="28">324 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) element that constitutes the unitary trait of a specific category or genre.85 It will be noticed that the functions traditionally attributed to kanazdshi (namely, entertain- ing, didactic, and practical) are not being used here as a parameter, for they are surely highly subjective and vary according to the reader and the epoch in which the text is read.86 1 have attempted here to design a system that is highly flexible and respectful of the nature of the texts. Within this system, it is possible to include both "historical genres," those that were perceived as such in the Edo period, and "empirical genres," whenever these can be identified a posteriori. In response to the most recent theoretical approaches to the genre issue, I have also allowed for the inclusion of "mixed texts," in which genres merge together in a process that can be identified in some cases as conscious on the part of the author or editor and in other cases as either subcon- scious or unintentional.87 How do the "historical genres" fit into this system? Let us look at some examples. Hanashibon , which appeared at the beginning of the seventeenth century and constitute a specific genre in the shojaku mokuroku , all share common features: they are antholo- gies of short comic stories having narrative and fictional characteristics that were used both as texts to read and as texts to be narrated by a performer. An analysis of this 85 For the notion of "dominant" in genre theory, see Jakobson 1987. 86 There have been constant efforts to create subcategories of kanazdshi. Noda Hisao's classifica- tion (first outlined in Noda 1947 and further developed in Noda 1960-1962) has acquired the aura of the standard scheme and consequently is found in most reference works, in the introductions to authoritative anthologies, and in Lane's work (see, for example, Nihon koten bungaku daijiten , vol. 1, p. 670; and Maeda and Morita 1965, pp. 9-10). If we compare this classification with the others produced so far, we may be struck by some differences on the surface level. Neverthe- less, a closer analysis shows that the criteria on which all these groupings are based respond to a similar logic: on the one hand, we have the function played by the text and, on the other hand, its contents. When the two criteria are combined, the first (the function of the text) is chosen as a mac- rodivision, and the second (the contents of the text) is used to create further microdivisions. The only functions recognized are those of entertainment, enlightenment, and practical instruction; no hybrid categories are included or even envisaged. The result is an extremely rigid system of classifi- cation in which, for the sake of order, the often composite or hybrid nature of seventeenth -century texts is passed over. From quite an early stage, Japanese scholars have expressed doubts about this classification scheme, although they have never overturned it in order to rebuild it anew. On how the function of a text varies according to its reception, see Rubinger 2007, p- 90, as well as his argument that "in some ways nosho (agricultural manuals) were for farmers what Saikaku s works were for townspeople" (p. 88). On a theoretical level, Roger Chartier claims that "the printed works designed for popular' consumption in early modern Europe reveal a broad range of intentions. . . . But in their reception (certainly difficult for the historian to decipher) these texts were often understood and handled by their popular' readers without regard for the intentions that governed their production or distribution" (Chartier 1995, p. 93), and he supports this argument with exam- ples taken from the Bibliotheque bleue. 87 For a view affirming the coexistence of genres in the same work see, for example, Genette 1979, p. 88, "on pourrait dire plus simplement que le melange . . . des genres est un genre parmi d' autre" (we could say more simply that a mixture ... of genres is one genre among others); Sportelli 2001, pp. 3-9; and Bagni 1997, p. 127.</page><page sequence="29">Moretti: Kanazoshi Revisited 325 genre as such throughout the whole of the Edo period reveals what was maintained of the original generic core and what was changed, eventually leading to the rakugo ?Â£!p of the Meiji period. Similarly, meishoki emerged in 1658 as nonnarrative guide- books to the main urban centers of the time, and their development throughout the period was complex: there were nonnarrative and nonfictional descriptions of famous places that constituted single entries in anthologies either with or without a narrative frame, there were similar kinds of texts in which the illustrations were as important as the text itself and in which long narrative passages relating to famous episodes were inserted in nonnarrative descriptions of places (for example, the series of works known as meisho zue %PJf 0^), and there were also route guides without any narrative dimension whatsoever.88 Finally, kana hogo , sermons written in kana that offered nonnarrative or mildly narrative explanations of the essentials of Buddhism, took shape well before the Edo period and facilitated the diffusion of Buddhist thought to a wider public. Once put into print at the beginning of the Edo period, they exhibited a new literary taste, mix- ing nonnarrative explanatory text within a fictional or nonfictional narrative frame. In the case of kana hogo , too, more research is needed to shed light on the genres further development later in the Edo period. The identification of genres that we can recognize as such retrospectively is a much more arduous task that should probably be undertaken after we have identified all the titles that are part of the vast mass of popular literature. It is not my goal here, though, to treat comprehensively all the genres that it may be possible to determine in the popular literature of the seventeenth century. My aim here, rather, is to demonstrate the potentialities inherent in the proposed system through specific case studies and to leave a more comprehensive survey for the future. In the following section I discuss textual examples that are particularly helpful for understanding both the continuities and the differences that early Edo popular prose literature in print reveals when com- pared with Muromachi-period and later Edo-period literary forms.89 88 For a preliminary analysis of meishoki as a historical genre, see Moretti 2008. 89 The methodological approach that I advocate here is similar to that applied by Dudbridge in his analysis of the tale of Ding Yue and of the work The Four Gentlemen of Liang. Dudbridge notes, "This paper naturally rejects the attempt to establish a definitive category of stories that might give formal substance to the 4 chuanqi' label, or erect some other in its place. It argues the contrary: such categories as these mislead and hinder our efforts to read Tang narrative sensitively. An age of remarkable creative experiment, unrestrained by prescriptions from state institutions, produced a harvest of works which echoed and resonated together in complex ways. To do justice to these interesting works we should let them stand alone, not pack them into pigeon holes" (Dudbridge 2005, pp. 207-208); and "This entirely formal analysis [made by the literary historian Hou Zhongyi about The Four Gentlemen of Liang] accepts the tyranny of one generic term with which to mea- sure the narrative achievements of the Tang period, and it was not even a term [chuanqi] which Tang writers themselves used in a generic sense. While the medieval bibliographers wrestled with interesting complexity, the 1990s sweep everything into one or two simple categories" (Dudbridge 2000, p. 64).</page><page sequence="30">326 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) Hallmarks of Early Modern Japanese Popular Prose Literature in Print The first aspect of seventeenth-century prose that strikes one as new is the inclusion of nonnarrative sections within narrative texts. It is certainly true that the popular prose of the Muromachi period sometimes contains embedded narratives or makes use of setsuwa related to the theme of the main text. It is undeniable that these introduce a more or less prominent pause in the main narrative.90 In the printed prose of the seventeenth century, however, it is not a matter of embedded narratives that force the "main" narration to pause, but rather of nonnarrative sections that temporarily break the narrative. There is, therefore, a considerable difference compared with Muromachi- period popular prose, and this is worth examining in some detail.91 Let us begin with Ada monogatari fp, a text written by Miura Tameharu HiS and published in 1640.92 The protagonists are anthropomorphic birds who fall in love with a beautiful bird-princess named Teriuso hime. Each of the forty-five birds addresses love poems to her, in most cases without obtaining any reply. Meanwhile, Teriuso falls ill and is healed by Fukuro Hoshi (owl monk), who in turn falls in love with the princess and sends her a love letter. After Fukuro falls ill with despair at not receiving a reply, the princess is moved and delivers a message to him through Mimizuku (horned owl). Unfortunately, Mimizuku loses the message, which, in turn, is found by an eagle. So Teriuso now becomes the object of the eagle's desires and, later, those of a falcon. In despair because of the rivalry of the three men/birds, the princess eventu- ally dies. Those who survive her decide to devote their lives to praying for her in the afterlife and to follow the path of Buddhism. The plot is an expanded adaptation of a Muromachi monogatari named Fukuro &lt;6^. In that text the owl is depicted from the beginning as being deeply in love with Uso hime, even though he is aware of the fact that she seldom replies to any of her suitors. Thanks to his prayers to the Buddha Yakushi and the help of an intermediary, he manages to attract the princess's interest, but eventually a jealous eagle kills her, leaving the owl alone and in despair.93 There is also another version of the same tale with slight differences in the construction of the plot: it includes two embedded stories reciting Chinese anecdotes, used by the owls intermediary to persuade the princess to reply, and it depicts the journey of the owl to the image of the Buddha Yakushi revered at Yoneyama.94 90 For a discussion of the possible relationship between Muromachi monogatari and setsuwa, see the entry on "setsuwa" by Asami Kazuhiko HfPÂ® in Tokuda 2002, pp. 77~79 â¢ For a definition of setsuwa in this context, see also note 114. 91 See also Moretti 2009.

A thorough analysis of the text, though, reveals interesting differences when com- pared with the Muromachi text, particularly the interruption in narration as a result of the insertion of nonnarrative or loosely narrative passages aimed at giving infor- mation to the reader. These passages constitute mini-treatises on different aspects of the cultural universe of the early Edo period, and they are generally inserted as part of the dialogue. The first instance is an outline of the history of mirrors ( kagami no iware *&lt;&amp;&lt;7)'^(ifl), where three types of mirrors are described, with detailed information about their origins (i:27a-3oa). Let us consider part of the passage concerning the second type of mirror: In the age of the gods when Sosanoo no Mikoto was in the region of Izumo there was a couple, Tenazuchi and Ashinazuchi. They had one daughter whose name was Inada-hime. A giant snake was minded to swallow the young girl. At that point Sosanoo no Mikoto told the couple that if they made their daughter his bride he would kill the snake. Since the promise was sincere, he soon got rid of the snake and married Inada-hime. As the bride- groom, Sosanoo no Mikoto received a gift of a mirror that measured eight sun in diameter and two shaku four sun in circumference. As a sign of his devotion to Amaterasu he passed the mirror on to Emperor Itoku, and this is the mirror that is kept in the apartments of the ladies-in-waiting to the emperor. This brief story about the so-called nomori no kagami certainly derives from the eighteenth volume of Nihon shoki But what is interesting is that the same passage can be found in certain encyclopedic books - extremely popular at the beginning of the Edo period - dealing with the origins of things.96 This specific passage, for example, is given almost unaltered in Kakkuishu (1668), an ency- clopedic text containing entries that describe the origins and the types of different objects that populated the everyday life of Edo Japan.97 An encyclopedic flavor is also to be found in the list of types of divination, fol- lowed by an explanation of the origin of divination itself, that Mimizuku offers the owl (2:23a-23b). A similar explanatory passage comes when the doctor who visits Teriuso-hime gives the precise names of medications contained in con- temporary herbals (2:41a) and a concise, though highly erudite, speech about the types of pulse (2:28a-39b). The text closes with a long sermon (2:54a-58b) that lacks the narrative character typical of setsuwa, for it consists of a nonnarrative explanation of Buddhist keywords such as Shakuson fKW-.goji hakkyo 2lB#A1$c, and jisshu +tk and gives detailed information about each of the ten Buddhist schools 95Noda 1986, pp. 87-94; and Nihon koten bungaku daijiten , vol. 1, p. 64. 96 The only study on the subject can be found in Kikuchi 1993. 97 Kakkuishu, 2:i7a-i7b.</page><page sequence="32">328 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) in Japan as well as the sutras linked to them. This passage bears comparison with the kana hogo mentioned earlier.98 Thus the chief difference between Fukurd and Ada monogatari consists of various nonnarrative passages that offer an encyclopedic view of the contemporary world. This difference may perhaps best be accounted for by the transformation of an orally transmitted text into a text printed for the commercial market in the early Edo period. Another revealing text from this point of view is Jigabachi monogatari an anonymous work first published in 1665." In the introduction, the author explains that the text collects things he has heard in the course of his life and that it aims at doing for readers just what wasps usually do when taking other insects young to their own nest, that is, raising them affectionately, teaching them good things, and educating them. Further information about authorial intention is provided in the eighteenth section of the first volume (i:2oa-2ib), where the author s voice explains that the anecdotes and poems (not only waka but also renga and haikai), mostly related to love, are intended to teach the way of compassion, which is deeply linked with the five virtues included in Buddhist doctrine; the "way of things" ( dori ilJS); and social obligations {giri HSI). To this he adds that "it is good to give the reader what may be useful, for example information about miraculous medicines and spells" (i:2ia-2ib). The result is a modular text, composed of 138 independent sections, that certainly belongs to the long tradition of zuihitsu PiUfc, but includes, in addition to material that can traditionally be found in such works (e.g., philosophical reflections, brief enlightening narratives, quotations of Japanese and Chinese poetry followed by explanations), humorous short stories taken from contemporary hanashibon (such as the story of the monk Ikkyu urinating on the statue of Jizo in Sekidera, which appears later in Ikkyu banashi &amp;L, published in 1668) and, in particular, highly practical passages that make this text a compact encyclopedia of knowledge for cop- ing with daily life. A few examples will be sufficient to illustrate the sort of nonnarra- tive dimension found here: Among the treatments to remove grease, that of sprinkling lime over oily stains makes it possible to clean off the dirt completely. It seems that the juice of daikon also works well. (2:37a) Spells to cure ringworm ( tamushi ): First of all, cut a piece of paper of the same size as the skin affected by ringworm. Attach the paper to a hackberry tree with adhesive and write three times, with the point of a knife, the magical sign of Abe no Seimei while pronouncing three times, "Abira unken, abira unken, abira unken." Whatever ringworm it is, it will disappear. Once it has been healed, 98 A similar textual nature can be found on a larger scale in Fushinseki (1645); see Moretti 2009 for details.

A certain jester said that when one suffers from ringworm one should dance beating a drum, and while doing so the ringworm will disappear. When asked about the reason for this treatment, he explained that when there are worms in the rice fields ( tamushi ) one can solve the problem by walking on the levee beating a drum. Because the ringworm bears the same name this method should work. (2:39b-4oa) Method for conserving Japanese pepper so that it does not go rotten: If you wrap pepper in a piece of paper imbued with tea and put a cover on top of it, it will remain unaltered forever. One must do this because light is bad for pepper. (3:11a) If you pee on the roots of a yuzu tree while it is young it will bloom and give fruit earlier. (3:18a) Among the 138 sections that compose the text, 41 are nonnarrative passages giving practical teachings about daily life similar to the examples translated above. In other words, almost 30 percent of this text is of the same nature as manuals of popular remedies, collections of recipes, or, more generally speaking, the so-called chohoki fi SIS (records of useful things). Much work remains to be done in order to trace the sources used by the author of Jigabachi monogatari. What must be underlined here is that this text can certainly be considered to belong to the tradition of zuihitsu, but it also renovates this genre through the insertion of practical teachings. Therefore, in Jigabachi monogatari the reader acquires not only a text that provides enlightenment and entertainment through the traditional literary dimension of the zuihitsu, but also a manual that contains practical instruction for everyday life. Another text that poses significant and challenging questions in terms of the coexistence of narrative and nonnarrative is Chikusai ryoji no hyoban written by an unknown author named Enpyoshi HI it-?* in 1685. 100 The text is a critique of one section of Chikusai , a work that includes nine short, humorous sto- ries dealing with treatments provided by a medical charlatan. I shall discuss that text in detail below. At the beginning of Chikusai ryoji no hyoban , the author explains that Chikusai "is indeed a booklet that is a source for tales ( hanashi no tane Oflt)" (1:1a), since it is a travelogue that narrates Chikusais journey from Kyoto to the East and offers hokku and kyoka at highlights along the way and at temples and shrines. At the same time, though, Enpyoshi explains that the part dealing with medicine is conceived as a counterpart to a Chinese medical treatise entitled Xuan- qijiu zhenglun $f RlfclEfra (Jp. Kenkikyu seiron).101 While the Chinese work openly 100 The four extant original copies were all printed using the same set of woodblocks. A critical edition is provided in Moretti 2000. No translations have been published to date. 101 This treatise was written around 1644 by Xiao Jing A copy of the original edition is available in the Naikaku Bunko rt the National Archives of Japan, Tokyo.</page><page sequence="34">330 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) denounces the bad behavior of poor physicians, Chikusai itself conceals this critical perspective beneath the hilarities of the floating world ( ukiyo ??#). Enpyoshi quotes each of the nine stories in the woodblock editions of Chikusai and juxtaposes a nonnarrative interpretation of their hidden medical significance, in particular extrapolating teachings about good and bad physicians.102 As I have shown elsewhere, these nonnarrative passages are based either on kanbun medical treatises translated into Japanese or on treatments from the realm of popular medicine.103 In both cases the reader learns how to behave when dealing with a doctor and acquires some general knowledge of medicine. In one passage, for example, Enpyoshi offers the following practical advice: When facing a complicated birth or a case of difficult afterbirth, one should take a pair of scales, heat them until they become red, put them into sake, and make the patient drink that sake. In doing so the woman will give birth to the baby and the placenta will come out. (1:11b) Here Enpyoshi is adapting a passage from the seventh chapter of Keitekishu H, a medical treatise written by the famous physician Manase Dosan (1507-1595). In describing a way of getting the placenta to come out, Dosan reports in kanbun that one should "take a mallet made of iron, heat it up, put it into sake, and make the patient drink the sake."104 While the comic stories quoted from Chikusai and other inserted sources allow Chikusai ryoji no hydban to be read as a narrative text, the presence of nonnarrative enlightening and practical passages relating to medicine aligns it with popular medical treatises produced at the time. Chikusai ryoji no hydban , however, also belongs to a group of works that are critiques of contemporary texts. Metatexts abound in the popular production of the early Edo period: Gion monogatari WBI%Ip (Kanei era), for instance, quotes and gives supplementary explanations about Kiyomizu monogatari (1638), switching the set of values from a Buddhist to a Buddhist- Confucian one. Kashoki hydban (1660) is another example, offering the reader an interpretation of the zuihitsu Kashoki (1636) with additional commentary and auxiliary teachings. What is striking in the case of Chikusai ryoji no hydban is that the reader cannot avoid perceiving an incongruity between the manifest comic inten- tions of Chikusai and the serious interpretation of its contents suggested by this critique. Enpyoshi manipulates the meaning of the original, bending it to his own didactic purposes and imposing readings that are not necessarily justified by the text itself. To use a term that became fashionable later in the Edo period, what we find here is a form of kojitsuke or "strained interpretation." From this point of 102 The quotations are not verbatim. Nonetheless, Enpyoshi's use of the woodblock editions is clear from his choice of stories (including that of the pregnant woman added for the first time in the Kanei-era woodblock edition). 103 Moretti 2001. 104 Keitekishu, 7:48b.</page><page sequence="35">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 331 view, the creative vein that permeates the text is no different from that which can be recognized in a later work such as Kojitsuke Momotard banashi (1788). If Chikusai rydji no hydban exploits Chikusai in order to conduct a discourse on the quality of physicians and allow the author to present a selection from medical treatises, Kojitsuke Momotard banashi offers an unnatural reading of the Momotaro story on the basis of the teachings of shingaku thought and makes clever use of the original tale to present the authors philosophical convictions. In both cases, the narrative substratum of the original is distorted in order to make possible a nonnar- rative discourse at variance with the nature of the original work. The fusion of narrative and nonnarrative elements dealing with the world of medi- cine is also found in another text contemporary to Chikusai rydji no hydban , Bokusai banashi isha hydban W (1695). 105 This narrates the story of the social climb of Chikusaburo (Chikusai s son, who takes the name Bokusai as a physician), a poor, incompetent doctor who manages to change his social and financial status by becoming erudite and skilled. If the plot appears quite simple and straightforward in summary, a detailed analysis of the text reveals its complexity. The plot, in fact, breaks up into smaller independent or semi-independent narratives that allow the narrative dimension to multiply, and among these we find the insertion of long nonnarrative passages about medicine. The short fictional narratives deal with Bokusais treatments, each time with a new patient. To these nine independent stories are added two semi-independent episodes that are part of the main narration: the first depicts a happening in Chikusais life - a humorous encounter with the god of poverty - and the second recounts the comic dialogue that takes place when Chikusaburo meets his master Hakokusai for the first time and makes fun of his name. The presence of these short stories justifies the use of the word "banashi" in the title: in this respect, Bokusai banashi does not differ much from the hanashibon discussed earlier. It is worth noticing that the two semi-independent episodes are actually rewritings of two short stories included in a hanashibon entitled Seisuisho.106 Bokusai banashi also includes nonnarrative passages on traditional medicine, and the main theme that pervades them could be summarized as "the image of the ideal physician." This aspect of the text certainly justifies the use of the expression "isha hyoban" in the title: in this case hyoban indicates a critique about what a doc- tor should or should not do or be. As in Chikusai ryoji no hyoban , these nonnarra- tive passages rely on existing medical texts. Different, though, is the way the parts are inserted into the text. They take the shape of a mondo fni^ (dialogue) between a patient and Bokusai: the patient s questions allow Bokusai to enlighten his interlocu- tor, as well as the reader, with erudite discourses. 105 The only extant copy of the original edition is kept in the Kyoto University Library. For a critical edition see Moretti 2002. No translations have been published to date. 106 Seisuisho , vol. 1, pp. 100, 125.</page><page sequence="36">332 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) At the end of the last of these speeches, the narrator describes Bokusai s lessons as "identical to tsuji dangi Â£ tl&amp;iif (5:15a), in other words, identical to the entertain- ing and educational lectures on different subjects delivered by street performers. This short comment made by the narrator sheds light on the role played by a text like Bokusai banashi within the panorama of the development of Edo-period popular prose. Inheriting and further refining the hybrid nature of Chikusai rydji no hyoban by being both a hanashibon and a collection of nonnarrative dangi WM about medi- cine, Bokusai banashi constitutes one stage of the development of a kind of text - perhaps one could even say a "genre" of texts - that, to borrow Fukuda Yasunori s terminology, are both "texts to be read for entertainment" ( yomimono !%&lt;&amp;%) and medical treatises ( isho ).107 Among other examples, we can cite Kensai monogatari (Kanbun era), Isha dangi (1759), Kyokun shuho kiku (1762), Shodan isha katagi (i774)&gt; and Tosei ishafurige (the first part published in 1821 and the second in 1822). 108 It is worth stress- ing here that only after erasing the current view of genres in Edo-period literature- regarding not only kanazoshi but also the similarly problematic so-called genres of ukiyozoshi , dangibon and kokkeibon to which these titles are usually assigned - and only after appreciating the coexistence of narrative and nonnarrative elements in a text can this genre at last be identified. The four works that I have chosen to discuss here give us valuable clues toward detecting a second aspect that became prominent once popular prose in the vernacular was put into print, namely, textual hybridism. Let us consider this feature by examining two further texts, Zeraku monogatari and Chikusai. Zeraku monogatari is a hybrid text where the main narrative frame tells the love story of the wealthy Tomona and his mistress Kisa, but at the same time constantly dissolves into potentially independent embedded narratives completely at variance with what we might define as a "love tale."109 The love story timidly makes its appearance in the first volume. After a brief description of Tomona and his loyal servant Zeraku, the narrator describes a dream that Tomona has during a brief doze on a summer afternoon: 107 Fukuda 1996. 108 Such a link between these works is suggested by the annotations made by an anonymous reader on the back of the cover of the Kyoto University copy of Bokusai banashi: together with Bokusai banashi the reader listed Isha dangi , Shodan isha katagi , and Tosei ishafurige , hinting at a shared identity. 109 According to Kokusho somokuroku , only two complete copies of the work are thought to be extant, one at the Toyo Bunko in Tokyo (available in facsimile; see Zeraku monogatari) and the other, whose whereabouts are currently unknown, formerly held by Yokoyama Shigeru Htlll Jt; incomplete copies can be found at the University of Tokyo and at the Tobacco and Salt Museum in Tokyo. A critical edition is available in SNKT 74, pp. 197-270. For a complete list of the few critical studies available on this work, see Kikuchi 1994. No translations have been published to date.</page><page sequence="37">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 333 Suddenly a woman came to him, aged about sixteen years and endowed with a graceful appearance and a refined perfume. They exchanged words as if they were old acquaintances, and at that point he woke up. (1:1a) This encounter becomes the cause of profound despair for Tomona. Albeit brief, this allusion to a potentially painful love story is sufficient to create a "horizon of expectations" in the reader: the reader expects to find the master plot of a type of love tale that had already been exploited in Muromachi-period popular prose, as we have seen with Fukurd , and continued into the Edo period (e.g., in Urami no suke).no Soon after this passage creates literary expectations (love at first sight at a temple, epistolary exchange, brief encounter, death of one of the two lovers, death or tonsure of the other lover), the love story is virtually abandoned, however, and Zeraku replaces Tomona as the real protagonist of the story. He takes part in a medical consultation in which the fundamentals of traditional medicine are described; he quarrels with his wife over his wish to follow Tomona, who is ill and about to embark on a journey to some hot springs in search of a cure; and he meets his lover, arousing his wifes anger.111 Thus, although at the outset Zeraku monogatari might have appeared to be a tale written in a mode of "simple narrativity," it progressively shifts into a mode of "complex narrativity" where "the micro narratives do not create their own semantic universe, but expand the universe of the main plot."112 In this specific case the text presents the parallel narrative of the co-protagonist Zeraku. The remainder of the first volume covers the journey of the two travelers, Tomona and Zeraku. The two protagonists almost disappear, and the narrative texture turns into a travelogue where place names become the real protagonists. These place names function as "narrative occasions" for either the composition of poetry or the inser- tion of an embedded story.113 It is not simply that the places visited by Tomona and Zeraku are described in detail; rather, there is a different form of narration, tran- sitioning into embedded stories that have their own logic. The type of story varies, with an account of the foundation of the temple Mimizuka, for example, embodying the mood typical of meishoku while other accounts display a greater degree of com- plexity. This is what happens in the passage devoted to Kiyomizudera. In answering a question about the origins of this temple, an unidentified character becomes the narrator of an embedded story containing information that can be verified with ref- erence to other contemporary primary sources (such as Kiyomizudera engi If Â®). This passage leads the reader into another, completely autonomous narrative 110 For the plot of Urami no suke see Lane 1957a, pp. 655-56. 111 Lane 1957a, p. 662, states, "it should also be noted that in the present title, 'Zeraku' is not the name of the hero but of the secondary male character, who assists him in his adventures," but a closer reading of the text shows a clear choice on the part of the author to make Zeraku the de facto main actor in the story. 112 For these terms see Ryan 1992, pp. 371-72. 113 Moretti 2008.</page><page sequence="38">334 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) world, inhabited by new characters and focused on the extraordinary facts that made the creation of the Kiyomizu temple possible: Among the many merciful things [related to Kiyomizudera], here is one. In the village of Fushimi there was a person who sought to make a pilgrimage to Kiyomizudera, having desired to do so for a long time. Since it was the eighteenth day that of the Ox, of the fifth month, a large crowd with all kinds of people- from Kyoto and from outside the capital, rich and poor - were walking or moving on to the temple. A woman of about seventy years called that man and began to talk to him. (1:22b) Functioning as a fictional Buddhist tale aimed at enlightening the reader, the episode seeks to show how awesome the power of the bodhisattva Kannon is.114 The dialogue between the man from Fushimi and the old woman reveals that her son had by mis- take sold a dangerous poison to an unknown woman who just happens to be the man's wife, and thus disaster is averted. This seemingly happy ending is crowned by a quotation from the Lotus Sutra. But here the narrator introduces an unexpected twist. We learn that the man goes back to his home in Fushimi only to realize that his wife had tried to use the poison to kill him but had herself become the victim of her own cunning plan. So Kannon is still to be praised, but now for the mans survival. It is only after this insertion that the reader is taken back to the main story, to discover Tomona and Zeraku standing in the precincts of Kiyomizudera and lis- tening to the story that the reader has just read. Here the reader realizes that the two main characters of Zeraku monogatari have been reduced to the role of passive listeners throughout this long passage. Now they resume their role as travelers. It will be clear, then, that in this first volume the reader moves within a complex narrative space where the love tale is supplanted by the travelogue and the travelogue becomes fertile ground for the insertion of embedded stories through which the reader encounters the coexistence of different genres. The first volume thus lacks unity or coherence and is rather a celebration of genre hybridization: what at the outset might have seemed like a simple love tale turns into a text that allows the reader to enjoy multiple literary traditions in the limited space of thirty folios. This narrative technique is further amplified in the second volume, which is taken up with the sojourn of Tomona and Zeraku at the hot springs. It is interesting to note that although Lane discusses Zeraku monogatari , he does not mention the exis- tence of a second volume.115 What happens in this section of the text? Surprisingly, no information is given about the activities of the two characters or about Tomonas cure; in other words, the main story is ignored. Instead, Tomona and Zeraku are 114 We may use the term "setsuwa" to describe this passage, choosing another of the meanings given to setsuwa by Noda Hisao when describing Edo-period collections of Buddhist tales such as Inga monogatari HSr^ln: short educational tales that narrate a brief story (fictional or not) and that are intended to provide the reader with religious or moral instruction.

The conversation immediately assumes the form of a dialogue ( mondo ) in which Zeraku performs the role of an informed narrator and skilled storyteller.116 In answer to a question about the famous Tang beauty Yokihi # JtiE (Ch. Yang Kueifei), which is prompted by a reference to Chinese hot springs, Zeraku narrates the whole story of the Chinese empress and her love for the emperor, including elements that had been part of the Yang Kueifei legend from the Muromachi period onward as well as features found in the Taiheiki version of the story.117 The second question that Zeraku is asked concerns the meaning of a proverb that was well known in the first half of the seventeenth century.118 The question is formulated in the following terms: "It is generally said that wealthy men know no second generation.' In the majority of cases the sons of the well-to-do become poor. Can you explain why this is?" (2:14a). Zeraku once more chooses a Chinese legend: this time he retells the story of Toshuko (Ch. Tao Zhugong), a prosperous man of the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 bce). This functions as an exemplary tale, and it is deeply imbued with the concerns about economic prosperity that were beginning to characterize urban life in Japan in the mid-seventeenth century. It once more obliges the reader to move to another genre: short didactic stories that serve as ethical admonitions for those who aim at obtaining economic stability and wealth, like the tales that can be found mixed with nonnarrative passages in Chojakyo italic and those that abound in Nippon ei- taigura and Saikaku oritome. After Zeraku finishes the second tale, the main narrator brings the reader back to the main story: some women invite the men to take their baths. As a result, we are told, Tomona recovers and, together with Zeraku, begins his journey back to the capi- tal. The genre hybridization found in the last part of the first volume thus recurs in the second, and what we face here is an example of multiple narrativity, a trait that also characterizes works such as The Canterbury Tales , The Decameron , and The Ara- bian Nights. The story of Tomona and Zeraku staying at a hot-spring resort becomes the "frame story," in other words, "a story which serves to motivate a series of other tales."119 The insertion of these "other tales" allows the reader to enjoy a text that, 116 It is not surprising that in the illustration (2:2a) Zeraku is depicted in the act of narrating and in the posture typical of a storyteller. 117 See Taiheiki 37, pp. 386-96. In her history of the reception of the Yang Kueifei legend in Japan, Masako Nakagawa Graham briefly refers to Zeraku monogatari (misidentifying it as Sera monogatari) and, on the basis of Kikuchi Shiriichi's work, affirms that "the story is based on the Chogonka-shdy medieval annotations on [Li] Pos poem, and consequently includes an account of Yang Kuo-chungs search for Yang Kuei-Fei s spirit." Nakagawa Graham 1998, p. 241. See also Kiku- chi 1981. The similarity with the content of the Taiheiki version allows much ground on which to discuss this theory, and future research about this point is desirable. 118 It is included, for example, in the second volume of Kefukigusa (section entitled "Sewa" â ffirlS) as chdja nidai nashi v&amp;L (wealthy men have no second generation).

It is only in the third volume that the main story is finally developed. The dream that Tomona saw at the beginning of the story turns out to have been a premonition, for at Shichijo in Kyoto he catches sight of a woman who looks like the one he had seen in his dream. The horizon of expectations raised at the very beginning of the text and set within the boundaries of the Muromachi-monogatari love tale is thus reaffirmed at the beginning of the third volume. Tomona now asks Zeraku to find out about the woman, and she (Kisa) and Tomona exchange love letters without having any chance to meet. At this point the master plot that can be found in other love tales is altered and complicated by the insertion of family dynamics: Zeraku persuades Kisas aged mother to allow the lovers to meet, and in order to keep this relationship secret from his wife, Tomona entrusts the woman to a certain Kyusuke, in a place he has easy access to. Kyusuke, however, turns out to be a dishonest man in search of economic gain, and together with his own wife he causes deep suffering to the young woman, eventually driving her to think of taking the tonsure. Zeraku inter- venes in time to prevent this and escorts the woman to his mistress's place; but the insatiable greed of Kyusuke and his wife and the ferocious jealousy of the wives of both Tomona and Zeraku lead to the separation of the two lovers and, in the end, to the woman's death.120 The ending is tinged once again with the colors of a Buddhist narrative aimed at the reader s enlightenment: Kisa appears in the dreams of all the persons related to Tomona and Zeraku in the guise of one who has attained buddha- hood, and she brings them to enlightenment. This conclusion gives, retrospectively, a new meaning to the whole text, as a love story rich in dramatic events turns out to be a well-constructed Buddhist tale that aims at the enlightenment of the reader. All the threads that had been outlined at the beginning of the text and then lost in the prolif- eration of embedded narratives are drawn together in the third volume. The human instincts sketched in the embedded stories of the second volume are employed to explain the behavior of the characters of the main story in the third volume.121 It is important to stress, nevertheless, that the unity restored in the third volume should not be taken as a basis for a positive judgment about this work or for the definition of its textual nature. The reader is provided with a text that is both unitary and multiple; the love story is embellished with various developments that allow het- erogeneous narrative fragments to multiply and diversify the pleasure of reading. As Katharine Slater Gittes has noticed with respect to the Arabic literary tradition, in particular in connection with the production of framed stories, there is no virtue in 120Mizutani Futo has advanced the hypothesis of an allusion to a real event, but unfortunately, to date no evidence has been found to confirm his conjecture. See Mizutani 1929, p. 133. 121 Even though such a correlation between the second and the third volumes is evident, I do not think it possible to speak about a real mise en abime (defined as "an internal reduplication of a lit- erary work or part of a work"; see Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms), as Kikuchi 1981 tentatively suggests.</page><page sequence="41">Moretti: Kanazoshi Revisited 337 imposing the concept of unity and wholeness formulated in Aristotle's poetic theory upon non-European literary traditions: fragmentation, lack of unity, and boundlessness can become positive elements in different literary cultures.122 Certainly a work like Zeraku monogatari presents an episodic plot that enables hybridity to play a central role in the text, simultaneously adopting elements of many genres and literary motifs. This specific aspect of the text can be appreciated only when we adopt a system that admits and values hybridity, and certainly not when we try to study the work from the standpoint of the "novel" or when we attempt to label it according to the prepackaged categories recognized by current kanazoshi theory. It is not by chance that the conclusions reached here differ consistently from the canonical view of this text. Lane, like his Japanese counterparts,123 pigeonholed this work so as to make it fit existing categories, and he did so disregarding the existence of the second vol- ume. Zeraku monogatari is thus included in the subcategory of "entertaining texts," described as a "love tale," and considered to be a work that introduced the "semi- realistic love theme."124 It is because of the "sense of realistic tragedy" Lane identified in this work that he claimed that Zeraku monogatari should be positively judged as "an important advance in the direction of the modern novel."125 He considered that the links with the "literary traditions of the time," the interest in describing the places visited by the two protagonists, and the "weaving of traditional elements" were all hindrances for the creation of a "new type of novel." The outline that Lane presented of the plot demonstrates his attempt to give coherence to this text: he included in his account only those parts of the work that deal with the love story. In order to make the " kanazoshi system" work, he distorted the real nature of the text. It must be emphasized that the novelty displayed by Zeraku monogatari , when compared with the Muromachi love story, does not consist of much "realism"; rather, it is a product of the extremely complex fragmentation and multiplication of the story into narratives belonging to different genres (i.e., love story, travelogue, mondo , and so on). Moreover, examination of the relationship between Zeraku monogatari and the texts mentioned above - such as Nippon eitaigura or Saikaku oritome - will also show how some of the elements found in this text were inherited by and brought to maturity in subsequent literary traditions, even after the age of Saikaku. Much work needs to be done to determine whether this kind of hybridism characterizes the prose of the seventeenth century and fades away in the following centuries, or remains a feature of the Edo period as a whole. A similar case in seventeenth-century popular prose is Chikusai.126 Chikusai dis- plays a symmetrical shape. The first and fifth parts mirror each other, depicting the 122 Slater Gittes 1983. 123Noda 1986, pp. 408-13. ^4Lane 1957a, p. 663. 125 Lane 1957a, p. 664. 126 Chikusai has survived in many copies that can be divided into six editions: two roughly iden- tical movable-type editions printed in Kyoto and four different woodblock editions, one of the</page><page sequence="42">338 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) protagonist Chikusai and his servant Niraminosuke in their wanderings in Kyoto and in Edo; the second and fourth parts work in a similar way, placing the two main characters on the way first from Kyoto to Nagoya and then from Nagoya to Edo; and the third part narrates the adventures of Chikusai as a quack doctor in Nagoya. The diversity of the contents incorporated in this structure becomes clearer when we examine each part more closely. The first section describes Chikusai strolling in Kyoto and visiting a few major highlights, but this portion of the text is not a guidebook, for the place names func- tion either as occasions for kyoka composition or as opportunities for inserting an embedded story.127 Here I shall focus on the system of stories inserted from the point at which the Kitano shrine is mentioned. In this part of the text, the narrator s point of view coincides with Chikusai s, so that Chikusai functions as a camera that shows us what is going on within the precincts of the shrine. As he looks first in one direc- tion and then another, he sees a group of beautiful women, a renga gathering, a game of kemariy a party at which fashionable songs are being sung, a noh performance, some gambling, an incense competition, a sumo tournament, and several young women who have decided to go to a temple to pray for spiritual enlightenment. At this point, the narrator ceases to be characterized by a limited degree of focalization and becomes instead omniscient, with the use of so-called zero focalization, which allows him to overcome any temporal or spatial barriers. Through the narrators words, the reader is guided to a temple, then into the bedchamber of a lustful monk, into the lascivious past of this monk evoked through a detailed description of his outfit, and, finally, into a conversation that takes place between him and his female guests within the private, enclosed space of his bedroom. The reader is thus absorbed in a brief independent story, one that is at first marked by a pronounced Buddhist or didactic character, but then slides into a tale of debauchery. When the women part from the monk, the reader is brought back to the Kitano shrine, with Chikusai look- ing in another direction. Chikusais gaze now leads the reader to another scene: a young man is falling in love with an older man. Once again, the use of omniscient narration allows the reader to follow the young man to his private dwelling, read the love letter he writes - a let- ter that follows the epistolary conventions to be found in other love stories written Kanei era, one of the Kanbun era, printed by Urokogataya in Edo, one of the Enpo era, again printed by Urokogataya in Edo, and one produced in 1683 in Edo as a kabusebori facsimile of the Enpo-era edition. Facsimiles of one of the movable-type editions and the Kanei- era edition are available in Chikusai 1970, and facsimiles of one of the movable-type editions and the Kanei-era, Kanbun-era, and Enpo-era editions are available in Chikusai 19 78; a critical edition of the Kanei-era edition is included in Maeda and Morita 1965, pp. 91-159. An almost-complete translation of one of the movable-type editions is provided in Bresler 1975, and a partial translation of one of the woodblock editions in Putzar i960. A complete Italian translation of the Kanei-era edition is available in Moretti 2003b. 127 For further details, see Moretti 2008.</page><page sequence="43">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 339 from the Muromachi period onward - and participate in his love sorrows. When the scene ends, the reader is returned once again to the Kitano shrine precincts, meeting once more with Chikusai, who had been rendered invisible in the course of the two embedded stories, despite the stories being told, at least initially, from his point of view. In the limited space of a few pages, the reader is thus confronted at the same time with one story - that of Chikusai s visit to Kyoto - and a brief didactic dialogue about Buddhism with a satirical ending and a tale of homosexual love with elements typical of an epistolary account. It is interesting to note that in the passage in which Chikusai arrives at the Kitano shrine, there is a significant divergence between the movable-type editions and the woodblock editions. While the former simply give a concise description of the temple, the latter use the Kitano shrine as a pretext to introduce a long and independent story of homosexual love that I shall discuss in detail below.128 As already mentioned in connection with Zeraku monogatari , what we today may perceive as a lack of unity was apparently something highly appreciated during the Edo period. Evidence for the penchant for hybridism lies in the fact that this story first appears in the Kanei-era form of the text and is then retained in sub- sequent editions. The hybrid nature of Chikusai described above is not restricted to the first section of the text. Rather, it is reinforced throughout the remainder as well. The second part is constructed as a michiyukibun ilfr ~X (i.e., the narration of a journey composed on the rhythmic alternation of phrases in five and seven syllables often linked by kakekotoba #|p|) that respects the rhetorical conventions found in many Muromachi- period texts and in yokyoku ISÂ® (noh texts); the third part is structured as a brief hanashibon , with nine short comic stories in which the main focus is on Chikusais appalling medical procedures; and the fourth part describes Chikusais journey from Nagoya, abandoning the michiyukibun style in favor of an intertextual rewriting of the "Azuma-kudari" section of Ise monogatari which continues in the fifth part, when Chikusai arrives in Edo. Both Japanese scholars and Lane include Chikusai in the subcategory of kanazdshi of a practical nature, characterizing it as a guidebook. Lane defined the text as a "fic- tional guide-book," claimed that "the novel consists principally of a description of the various sights and scenes along the Tokaido highway, with kyoka verses composed by the two characters inserted at appropriate intervals along the way," and added that "considerable interest is evinced in the local color and the realistic depiction of the scenes along the journey, together with the difficulties experienced by the impe- cunious protagonists."129 As we have seen above, to describe Chikusai as a "fictional guide-book" is to misrepresent it and to obscure the hybridity of the text. What is more, it is evident from the continuing impact Chikusai had on subsequent texts that 128 See Iwata 2002, p. 350. 129 Lane 1957a, pp. 677-78.</page><page sequence="44">340 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) it was popular and struck a chord, and that it had an intertextual life that by no means ended with the publication of Saikakus prose works.130 There is a further aspect of Chikusai that is worth considering here, since it exemplifies another characteristic of popular prose - textual mouvance.131 Scholars of Muromachi-period prose may object that textual mouvance is also character- istic of the oral and scribal transmission of Muromachi monogatari. As we have noted above when dealing with Fukurd , the same plot may be narrated in texts that are slightly different, and it is not by chance that the most influential anthology of Muromachi monogatari provides many versions of the same text as extant in man- uscripts and printed books.132 When dealing with printed popular prose, though, the same phenomenon can be ascribed to different motivations. In particular, it seems to have been commercially driven: it may be that publishers, whose goal was to sell as many books as possible, would have been willing to revise a text accord- ing to the changing tastes of their readers if that was a means to high sales. There- fore, when popular prose entered the commercial dimension of print, texts did not need to be fixed entities; they were, rather, protean constructs that could mutate in accordance with the perceived needs of the public and/or marketing decisions taken by the publisher. In this connection let us consider Chikusai once more as an interesting case study. As briefly mentioned above, a significant revision in content takes place when Chikusai shifts from movable- type edition to woodblock edition in the Kanei era. The major change is the inclusion of a new embedded narrative about homosexual love ( nanshoku , or danshoku J?fe), which takes up more than a quarter of the text. The protagonists of this embedded story are two samurai, a man of Harima and the young Sasaki Uneme. The former goes to the Uzumasa temple to pray to the Buddha Yakushi, where he catches sight of a boy about seventeen years old and immediately falls in love with him. Resolved to show this young man his affection, he follows him to the Kamo shrine, manages to deliver to him a love letter, and then waits for an answer. One night the boy comes to his house, and they spend the night together. Unfortunately, their duties and the social constraints of the period force them apart, until the man of Harima hears that his beloved has died of an illness. He resolves to commit suicide and goes to the Kurodani temple, first to pray over the grave of his beloved and then to carry out his intentions. On the point of killing himself, he is stopped by his lord. Obeying his master s words, he decides to become a monk. When life in Kyoto becomes unbear- able, he finally moves to the East. This long embedded story creates a break in the main narrative of the incompetent doctor Chikusai and reinforces the genre hybridism analyzed above, thus making Chikusai also a nanshoku text. The story additionally 130 For first studies of the intertextual serialization that emerged from Chikusai , see Moretti 2001 and Moretti 2003a. 131 For a theoretical discussion of textual mouvance (also referred to as textual variance, textual instability, and textual fluidity) see Cerquiglini 1989; Zumthor 1972; and Bryant 2002. 132 Cf. Muromachi jidai monogatari taisei.</page><page sequence="45">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 341 works as an appropriative rewriting of the love story that constitutes the master plot evident in Fukurd and Ada monogatari and partly in Zeraku monogatari : the appro- priation takes place in reenvisioning this plot from the point of view of homosexual love. The question we now face is why, at a certain point in the publishing history of Chikusai, the text changed in such an abrupt way Following the suggestions that we find in studies by Ishii Yuko and by Ishikawa Ryo Sill 7, it is possible to justify this textual variation as a commer- cial response to the popularity that the theme of male homosexual love was gain- ing in the Kanei era as a literary motif.133 As Iwata Junichi gEBip- has shown in his detailed survey of nanshoku in Edo-period literature, the Kanei era can be seen as "the age of wakashu ?r^."134 Among the texts wholly devoted to nanshoku and printed in the seventeenth century we can mention Inu tanka (Keicho/Genna jufP eras), which advises against bad wakashu ; Wakashu monogatari (Kanei era), which repeats Inu tanka with slight variations; Chigo kyokun jfilfcffll (date unknown), which uses, again, some passages from Inu tanka; Shudo monogatari (1661), which gives a series of examples of homosexual love taken from the Japanese and the Chinese traditions, pointing out that love should be central in this kind of relation- ship; Mokuzu monogatari (Kanei era), which reports a real-life event that occurred in 1640; Denbu mono Â± +ari (Kanei era), which is structured as a quarrel between an advocate for heterosexual love and a supporter of homosexual love; and Kenmotsu soshi SÂ£^^7(Kanei era), which reports events that occurred in connection with the death of Matsudaira Tadayoshi and the consequent suicides of his followers. The editors choice to graft a nanshoku tale onto the new edition of Chikusai can no doubt be attributed to a desire to appeal to potential readers by inserting a passage that follows contemporary literary trends.135 A similar commercial motivation sustains the variations seen in the physical aspects of the book from one edition to another. In the specific case of Chikusai , consistent changes in the bibliographic format occurred when the text was reprinted in Edo. The first Edo edition was published by Urokogataya Â§lÂ®It.136 For this work Urokogataya abandoned the cumbersome obon size for the handier chubon ^ 133 Ishii 1998 and Ishikawa 1990. 134 Iwata 2002. 135 Ishii 1998 and Ishikawa 1990 have also advanced the hypothesis that this textual graft might be the literary reply to a real event that occurred a few years before the publication of this new edi- tion of Chikusai , but to date no convincing evidence has come to light. 136 This edition of the text is also known as Kudari Chikusai banashi TWSfti&amp;L (the exter- nal title of the copy in the Richard Lane Collection), Chikusai kyoka banashi 1 (the external title of the copy in the Toyo Bunko) and Chikusai shokoku monogatari ft Srif Hlfefn (the external title of the copy previously held by the Akagi Bunko but now available only in facsimile form in Chikusai 1978, vol. 30, pp. 275-407). The copy in the Richard Lane Collec- tion contains a colophon reading "Odenmacho sanchome / Urokogataya kaiban" and is therefore earlier than the other copies that are known to have survived. Asakura Haruhiko states that the copy possessed by Lane, about which he merely heard from</page><page sequence="46">342 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) ^ (18.9 x 13.3 cm).137 In order to squeeze the whole text of the Kanei edition into this new size, the publisher adopted a format of three volumes, instead of two, as well as a calligraphic style that was similar to the one it used in joruri booklets and that served to "compress" the kana and kanji as much as possible.138 There were changes to the illustrations, too. The Kanei-era edition contained twenty-six illustrations, each of which was confined to either the recto or the verso of a leaf and offered a crude ren- dering of human figures and landscapes. The Urokogataya edition, on the other hand, reduced the number of illustrations to fifteen, but allocated two facing pages to each. This choice allowed a more meticulous rendering of the details of each illustration, resulting in higher artistic quality. The realistic portrayal of action scenes (such as the party enlivened by music and songs in the Kitano-shrine scene, i:iob-na), the depic- tion of specific social/human categories (for example, the wakashu in the nanshoku story, i:i9b-2oa, i:24b-25a), and the imitation of the style found in meishoki for the depiction of famous sites (such as the Kyoto Daibutsu, i:6b~7a) render this edition of Chikusai highly enjoyable as an illustrated book. This new dimension of the text is suggested also by the choice of a distinctive cover, which can be seen on the copy in the Richard Lane Collection: stylized lightning bolts with images of dragons inserted in circles ar scattered against a blue back- ground. This is a type of cover traditionally lir'jd with illustrated books ( ehon $) and with the first examples of the texts later known as akahon .139 The mouvance displayed in the bibliographic dimension of Chikusai allows a form of re-genreing of the text itself, making it part of the world of the illustrated book.140 This new generic dimension of the text is further amplified in the next edition issued by Urokogataya, in which the illustrations are made by one of the leading art- ists of the time, Hishikawa Moronobu HillÂ® |T.141 In this edition, the illustrations Yokoyama Shigeru, is of the 1683 edition. See Asakura 1961. This is a mistake probably caused by the presence of a misleading annotation in red on the cover and on the mikaeshi of the first volume, which says, "edition of the third year of the Tenna era." 137 When this edition was republished as Chikusai kyoka monogatari and Chikusai shokoku mono- gatari , the text appeared to be larger (22.2 x 15.5 cm), simply because of the size of the paper used. 138 In later reprintings, the text is split into four volumes, even though the page numbers remain the same. 139 Kyokutei Bakin recognized the link between this kind of cover and ehon/ akahon in his Enseki zasshi ^^5" Jt/S (1811). For further details, see Kimura 2009, pp. 30-33. 140 As D. F. McKenzie and Roger Chartier have demonstrated, "forms affect meaning" (McKenzie i999&gt; P- 13). Therefore it is necessary to study "the space between text and object" (Chartier 1992, p. 10) and to understand how "variations in the most purely formal aspects of a texts presentation can thus modify both its register of reference and its mode of interpretation" (Chartier 1992, p. 11). In Chikusai's case, the new form allows the reader to consider this text as belonging to a different genre, i.e., that of illustrated books. 141 One copy with no date in the colophon is available in facsimile form in Chikusai 1978, vol. 31, pp. 111-203. In the later facsimile ( kabusebori ) woodblock edition produced in 1683, the colophon</page><page sequence="47">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 343 decrease to twelve, but they display one of the typical devices used by Moronobu - a decorative frame consisting of clouds.142 The textual mouvance that characterizes Chikusai can also be detected in other texts produced at the beginning of the Edo period- Urami no suke , Chojakyo, Jinteki mondo and Fufu shuron monogatari among others - and in their evolution throughout that period. Further study is needed to develop a better understanding of how Edo-period textual mouvance depended upon the commercial strategies of publishers. Conclusion In this study I have sought to demonstrate that the supposed genre label kanazdshi , long used to denote the fiction of the seventeenth century up to but not including the works of Ihara Saikaku, is actually no more than an anachronistic concept formulated in the Meiji period and uncritically inherited by literary historians up to the present day. Furthermore, I hope to have shown that the search for a presumed but undefined genre of "novels," chronologically trapped between the beginning of the seventeenth century and Saikaku s works and seen as of inferior literary value to those works, has in fact been detrimental to the study of seventeenth-century printed prose literature. Following a critical review and rejection of the established consensus on this subject, I have tried to redefine the vast realm of popular prose literature in the vernacu- lar through the analysis of contemporary sources such as Genroku taiheiki and the shojaku mokuroku. This process has demonstrated that the distinction between the three genres of otogizoshi , kanazdshi , and ukiyozoshi did not exist in the Edo period. It has also proved that there existed other historical genres about which we are not yet fully aware.143 In addition, we have seen that many texts were not organized into categories, but instead were part of a literary space that shares much of the "sea imagery" applied by Glen Dudbridge in his definition of Tang literature: a literature that is "fluid, restless, unstable, pervasive, irregular and rich. Above all . . . generically unstructured."144 In order to allow a certain organization of this generically unstructured literary space, I have discussed the theoretical parameters of a new literary system that is highly flexible in enabling the recognition and evaluation of hybridism at many levels (such as narrative/nonnarrative/mixture of narrative and nonnarrative; fictional/ nonfictional/mixture of fictional and nonfictional) and dynamic in imagining the remains the same apart from the addition of the date "propitious day of the third month of the third year of the Tenna era." See the copy in Katei Bunko University of Tokyo Library. 142 For details see Iriguchi 2009. 143Nagashima 1999 and Nobuhiro and Nagashima 2005 have tried to address a similar meth- odological issue by pointing out the need to transcend established genres when dealing with Edo- period literature as a whole. 144 Dudbridge 2005, p. 6.</page><page sequence="48">344 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) possible development of groups (or kinds, or genres) of texts throughout the whole Edo period. I have limited myself here to applying this new lens to selected case studies of works that do not share anything with the novel and that are open to a nonnarrative dimension, and I have identified three elements that I consider charac- teristic of printed popular prose in seventeenth-century Japan. The first element that becomes widespread once popular prose moves from the oral transmission of the Muromachi period to print at the beginning of the seventeenth century is the appearance of nonnarrative text in the context of narrative text. On the one hand, we encounter texts that are entirely nonnarrative and that are per- ceived in the shojaku mokuroku as a valid part of prose production in the vernacular. These include dialogues about Buddhism, medicine, Confucian ethics, and so on; guidebooks; elementary manuals of Chinese traditional medicine, moxibustion, and acupuncture; and handbooks for the education of women. On the other hand, we find within the microcosm of individual texts the coexistence of narrative and non- narrative, as seen in Ada monogatari , Jigabachi monogatari , Chikusai rydji no hydban, and Bokusai banashi isha hydban. The second element of novelty is the presence of a more complex textual discourse in which genre hybridism plays a central role, as seen in Zeraku monogatari and Chikusai. The third element is the phenomenon of textual mouvance applied to printed texts as a response to the commercial motives of the publishers. This study is a first step toward a reconception of Edo-period popular literature. Much work remains to be done in order to understand how popular prose in print evolved later in the Edo period. What is clear is that Saikaku does not constitute any turning point per se. Our questions, therefore, should not focus so much on the realm of ukiyozoshi, but rather be directed toward a more complex view of Edo- period prose. How do the three elements mentioned above evolve? Does the mix- ture of narrative and nonnarrative pervade Edo-period literature, or does it apply to certain texts and not to others? What about genre hybridism and textual mouvance ? How do the historical genres evident in the shojaku mokuroku develop throughout the Edo period? When, in what way, and why do they change? When do new histori- cal genres emerge, and what are these genres? What empirical genres can we detect a posteriori? How do these empirical genres develop? Is there a clear difference between the popular prose of the Kamigata region and that printed in Edo, or is the relationship between these two more blurred and complex than has been considered here? Once we are free of the obsessive search for novels, of particular genre labels, and of artificial chronological boundaries, new horizons of research open up within the great unread mass of Edo-period popular literature. Works that existed in the Muromachi period but were rewritten during the Edo period pose questions about textual changes made to fit the needs of new readers. Jinteki mondo is a good exam- ple in this respect: It circulated in manuscript form in the Muromachi period as a didactic dialogue centered on philosophical issues related to the Shingon tradition</page><page sequence="49">Moretti: Kanazdshi Revisited 345 and written in a learned language with a mixture of kanji and katakana. Those who put it into print at the beginning of the seventeenth century retained much of the original text, but made a number of changes, providing a more easily accessible mixture of kanji and hiragana, expunging any emphasis on Shingon doctrine, and adding new content that turned the text into a treatise on the origins of things.145 Further, some texts produced during the seventeenth century were inserted in works published later. For example, Okashi otoko JÂ§, which is both a minimal parody of Ise monogatari and a guidebook to the pleasure quarters, is included in Nanshoku kasho haori JÂ§feU: of 1704. Others were reprinted in new editions (often with physical changes in size, binding, page layout, and so on, in response to new trends) or in kaidaibon (reprints with new titles).146 Edo popular prose production also encouraged the creation of intertextual serializations of previous texts (for exam- ple, those developed out of Chikusai ); each such instance forces us to consider how the source text is reappropriated, as well as how it may or may not undergo a process of re-genreing.147 These are but some of the questions and some of the research pos- sibilities that come into prominence when we begin to 4 confront the primary texts as best we can in their own environment and accept all the complexity that may face us there"148 145 For an introduction to the literary trend of texts dealing with the origins of things, see Kiku- chi 1993. 146 On kaidaibon , see Noma 1942. 147 See Moretti 2001. 148 This quote from Dudbridge 2005, pp. 197-98, made in connection with the study of Tang prose, perfectly fits the case of Japanese seventeenth -century popular prose.</page><page sequence="50">346 Monumenta Nipponica 65:2 (2010) References Abbott 2002 Porter H.
