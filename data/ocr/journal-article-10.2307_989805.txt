Bianconi's "Elogio storico del Cavaliere Giambattista Pira- nesi," in the Antologia Romana of February I779. This was sharp, not altogether accurate and surprisingly irreverent. It is still worth reading. At the turn of the century J. G. Legrand, brother-in-law to C. L. Cleris- seau, a close friend of Piranesi, wrote a longer and more circumstantial account of his life, "Notice historique sur la vie et les ouvrages de J. B. Piranesi. .." There was, as one might expect, a strong French bias to this. The manuscript was discovered more than a hundred years later by Henri Focillon, but was not published until 1921, and then in Italy by G. Morazzoni; in France it was to appear only in 1969 in the roneo format of the Nouvelles de l'Estampe. Legrand knew Piranesi's sons and prob- ably based his account on a memoir written by one of them, no doubt the eldest Francesco, which was to serve again as a source for a summary, but reliably informed "Life of the Chevalier Giovanni Battista Piranesi," published in 1831 in the Library of the Fine Arts, by James Kennedy, a barrister and later MP. Francesco's manuscript then disappeared with- out trace. The only other printed records of a contemporary kind- Piranesi's works and catalogues apart-were the anecdotes and the transcript of a letter from Piranesi to his sister included in Pietro Biagi's 333</page><page sequence="2">334 JSAH, XLI:4, DECEMBER 1982 "Sull'incisione e sul Piranesi .. ." of I82o. Thereafter, throughout the I9th century there were a great many notices on Piranesi and his works, biographical entries in reference books and pioneering articles, but not much of import. The first significant studies were Arthur Samuel's parochial compilation Piranesi, of 9Io0, and Albert Giesecke's more methodical dissertation "Studien uiber G. B. Piranesi" and his related articles, all of I911. The seminal work however, was Henri Focillon's life and catalogue of I918, reprinted in 1928 and i963, translated into Italian in I967 and, even today, though often held in question, still the standard work of reference. The counterpart, though scarcely the equiv- alent, in English, is Arthur Hind's critical study of 1922, reprinted in 1968, which has served especially to date and to classify the plates of Piranesi's most popular etchings, the Vedute di Roma. Hind, though valued still, is now thought to have relied rather too uncritically on the catalogue published in 1792 by Piranesi's sons. Aspects of Piranesi's activity were illuminated subsequently by a range of scholars: Werner Korte first charted his architectural career in 1933; Rudolf Wittkower dealt with the dispute concerning Greek and Roman architecture in 1938, and in 1961 unfolded the history of Santa Maria del Priorato with a meticulous analysis of the building accounts. Pira- nesi's drawings were first revealed as worthy of serious study in 1948, in Felice Stampfle's description of those in the Pierpont Morgan collec- tion, to be followed in 1954 by Hylton Thomas' sensitive, if stylish book on most of the Piranesi drawings identified at that date, though not all of those in the German collections, with which he was unfamiliar. The interaction between Piranesi and the French pensionnaires in Rome was first explored, in Danish, in 1943, by Christian Elling, then by John Harris, in English, in 1967. Piranesi's predecessors and his heritage were the subject of a small but vitally informed exhibition arranged by Ed- ward Croft-Murray at the British Museum in 1968. There have, of course, been other discoveries, other summaries, but in all this exegesis there has been very little attempt to interpret Piranesi's work, to explore its meaning. Only the Carceri has attracted inquisitive minds. Aldous Huxley skirmished with a psychological study in 1949; in 1958 Ulya Vogt-Goknil and, four years later, Patricia May Sekler, showed just how ambiguous and irrational were the architectural ar- rangements depicted in the plates. But the first subtle apprehension of the mental approaches and attitudes that animated those extraordinary interiors was provided by Maurizio Calvesi in 1967, in the introduction to the Italian edition of Focillon's work and in a catalogue of an exhibi- tion held in that year in Rome. Calvesi saw them as springing from a consciousness of history derived from Vico and others, interpreted with reference to Livy's accounts of the Rome of Nero. The germ of this idea was contained in an article by Herman Bauer in the Kunstchronik in 1959, but Calvesi made it his own and elaborated it with brilliance and daring. He was, however, thought too adventurous by far and his specu- lations were soon cut down with scholarly punctilio by Silvia Gavuzzo Stewart and shown to relate, sensibly, to no more than three plates- three plates belonging to the revised edition of the Carceri alone. In the same year, 1971, Manfredo Tafuri presented the first in a series of even more idiosyncratic studies of the Carceri, seen as a "negative utopia." He is still pursuing this theme, not greatly regarded by scholars, though greatly admired by architects of intellectual pretension. Another field of investigation that has now become something of a cult is the analysis of masonic themes in Piranesi's work. But the real spate of Piranesi publications in the past two decades has related rather to a succession of remarkable exhibitions culminating in those designed to commemorate the second centenary of his death-in Northampton and Turin in 1961, Paris in 1962, Bologna in 1963, Rome in 1967, London in 1968, Princeton in 1971, New York in 1972, Rome, Dijon and Paris in 1976, London, Venice and Washington in I978, and Rome yet again in I979. Piranesi might be thought to have been over- exposed. But, in addition, there have been reprints of most of his works and two full scale biographies not to mention lesser studies. More are announced. The literature is now formidable and precision has been brought to bear on much of Piranesi's history. What is extraordinary, however, in view of the perfervid display of interest, is how little we still know, how feeble is our understanding of Piranesi's passion and the intensities of thought and feeling of the world within which he moved. There is a dreadful sameness to the recent catalogues and books, with their compendious and redundant annotations, each referring to the next, with the errors, mainly of a bibliographical kind, dutifully tran- scribed. Focillon's account remains virtually intact. One might take this as a sign of consensus were it not all too evident that we are still in need of a great deal of essential information. Very few of Piranesi's admirers are looking hard enough at his work or undertaking the new research needed to explain it. Constipation has at least prompted a purge-of a minor sort. There has been a determined effort to reject the compounded histories that have been handed down and to return instead to the early printed sources for illumination. A facsimile of Bianconi's obituary is offered in the catalogue of the Roman exhibition of 1976, Grafica grafica 11:2, together with a thoughtful commentary by Carlo Bertelli. Roberto Pane, though not reproducing the text, devotes several pages of his Paestum nelle acqueforti di Piranesi to a discussion of Bianconi's assessment of Piranesi. J. G. Legrand's life has been republished no less than three times in recent years, with fulsome glosses on each occasion: once, by Marina Miraglia, in Grafica grafica 11:2, together with the supple- mentary notes usually credited to E. Q. Visconti, using the text of the Morazzoni edition of 1921, but with emendations derived from the Nouvelles de l'Estampe publication; once in Piranese et les francais, colloque ..., by Gilbert Erouart and Monique Mosser, who have returned to the original manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris and with some confidence claim the supplementary notes for Legrand. Visconti, it appears, was no more than the keeper of the manu- scripts. Erouart and Mosser's footnotes are useful, if suffocating, but they cannot always be relied on for exactitude; they assume, for in- stance, that Morazzoni translated Legrand into Italian and in dealing with Pierre Patte's copying from the Prima parte they fail to mention the example of his Etudes d'architecture of I755. Roberto Pane, once again, includes a full, if capriciously edited version of Legrand's life in his study of Paestum, where it serves, somewhat surprisingly, as a prime feature of the book. His footnotes and comments are extensive, perhaps excessive. He accepts the supplementary notes as the work of Legrand. Biagi's and Kennedy's lives of Piranesi have not been reprinted, but Piranesi's dedicatory letter of 8 July 1743, addressed to Nicola Giobbe, surviving in no more than a handful of copies of the Prima parte, is included in Dorothea Nyberg's catalogue of the drawings and etchings exhibited at Columbia University in 1972, where it is also translated into English; it appears in facsimile in Grafica grafica II:2, with a pointed but tactful commentary by Carlo Bertelli; and also in Jorg Garms's article on the Prima parte included in the catalogue of the exhibition of Piranesi etchings held in Venice in 1978. Piranesi's irate letter to Mengs, of 1772, on the subject of a proposed monument to Pio Balesta, is reproduced in Grafica grafica II:2, once again with a commentary by Carlo Bertelli, while the inventory drawn up after Piranesi's death, first discussed by Franco Borsi in I972, is the subject of an entire chapter in Pane's book on Paestum. This widespread interest in the early sources has been accompanied by an intense concern to date the etchings ever more precisely, especially the early etchings. This was the prime aim of at least two exhibitions, that held in Rome in 1976 and that in Washington in 1978, though it was clearly a matter of high import also for the organizers of the exhibitions arranged at Columbia University in 1972 and at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini in Venice in 1978. Indeed, the history of Piranesi's views for the guide books of Rome is more comprehensively and more concisely sum- marized in Alessandro Bettagno's note in the catalogue to this last ex- hibition than anywhere else, though even his summary needs to be ad- justed with reference to Werner Oechslin's entry on the subject in the catalogue Piranese et les francais (182-183) and, more relevant per- haps, Henry Millon's paper "Vasi-Piranesi-Juvarra" delivered at the accompanying conference. Millon's is a brisk and purposeful attempt to</page><page sequence="3">summarize Piranesi's activity as an etcher up to the time of his quarrel with Vasi, postulating, among other things, that several of Vasi's plates in the Della magnificenza . . . should be credited to Piranesi and that Piranesi may be assumed to have carried off others on which he was working at the time, to be incorporated into his own Antichita romane de' tempi della repubblica.... Millon's account of Vasi's early activity requires, now, to be adjusted with reference to Luisa Scalabroni's Giu- seppe Vasi (1710-1782), published in 1981. The fullest discussion of the early history of the Prima parte is pro- vided by Jorg Garms in Piranese et les francais colloque . . . and, in lively fashion, in the catalogue of the exhibition of etchings held in Venice in 1978; but for the most extensive (if short) catalogue entries on the various states of these etchings one must refer to Grafica grafica II:2. Indeed, as must now be evident, for all matters of exactitude and precision relating to primary sources this catalogue is an essential ref- erence-the Capricci, the Caduta di Fetonte and the Carceri, in addition to those suites and sources already cited, are catalogued there, though to appreciate the full significance of this accumulation the exhibition must needs have been seen. The history of Piranesi's plates in the i9th century, one might add, is also summarized in the catalogue in an article by Onofrio Speciale and numerous tables are appended recording the sales of individual etchings and suites from the Calcografia Nazionale from 1839 onwards. The best years for sales were I84 1 and 1844, with almost no demand after I847. The most popular plates were the columns of Marcus Aurelius and Trajan, with various views of Rome to follow. The 9th-century estimation of Piranesi, like that of the i 8th century, clearly does not accord with our own. Other attempts to bring precision to bear on the dating and analysis of Piranesi's early work may be cited-especially the notes on the etchings included in the catalogue of the exhibition at Columbia University in I972, which are enhanced by excellent reproductions not only of a number of the early etchings, but also by the 23 drawings relating to the design for the east end of San Giovanni in Laterano, given to the Avery Architectural Library in 1971 by Dr. and Mrs. Sackler. Here, inci- dentally, Piranesi is revealed at his most baroque, carefully relating his surface articulations to those of Borromini and attempting in one of the five variant designs for the apse to ensure an indirect source of light for the altar in exactly the same way as proposed by Soufflot in the same year, 1764, for the east end of Sainte Genevieve, Paris. But for the most persuasive and convincing analysis of the many difficulties involved in any investigation of Piranesi's early activity there can be no doubt that the writings of one scholar are to be preferred above all others. Andrew Robison's "Giovanni Battista Piranesi: Prolegomena to the Princeton Collections," included in the Princeton University Library Chronicle of Spring 1970 and his catalogue of Piranesi's early fantasies shown at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, in 1978, inspire confidence in an unparalleled way. Robison is averse to any discussion of the meaning or context of Piranesi's themes. Neither from the Grotteschi nor the Car- ceri are any overtones or intricate explanations to be teased; the former "are best understood in terms of the general theme of decay set in con- texts of deliberate ambiguity," the latter represent an exploration of texture and scale alone, with aspects of psychological or other incarcera- tion to be observed only in one or two plates of the revised version. Even then these plates depict no more than the ancient prisons of Rome being rediscovered by Piranesi's contemporaries, the spectators being shown in contemporary dress, the phantoms of the past as classical nudes. This is a reassuring picture, without disquiet, without any real concern for the creative springs of Piranesi's mind. To many it will seem an evasion. But for a careful inspection of Piranesi's methods and techniques and for the sharpest observation of how they might change from one print to the next and how they might serve to establish the pattern and chronology of Piranesi's development, there is no one to equal Robison. He is extra- ordinarily sensitive to the nuances of surface and line and is able to explain with the utmost clarity how he arrives at his conclusions. He is a master of a kind. His catalogue raisonne of Piranesi's early works, so long and so expectantly awaited, will no doubt resolve many of the BOOK REVIEWS 335 difficulties and complexities of Piranesian interpretation, which must, inevitably, be founded on an exact chronology; until it appears the National Gallery catalogue will serve as the surest guide on all such matters concerning the Prima parte, the Grotteschi and the Carceri. Life and Works Piranesi's career has been recounted in four recent studies, the first in English since Alpheus Hyatt Mayor's Giovanni Battista Piranesi of 1952. Those by Roseline Bacou and Nicholas Penny are intended as no more than summary if provocative introductions to his achievement, while those by Jonathan Scott and John Wilton-Ely are offered as stan- dard works of reference. All, it should be said, though useful, are essen- tially conventional, based neither on significant new research nor fresh perceptions. Indeed they provide very little more by way of a history or stimulus than Peter Murray's lecture "Piranesi and the grandeur of an- cient Rome," of I971. Bacou's study, published first in 1974 in French, consists of a text of 12 pages in which Piranesi's life is recalled, altogether sensibly, closely following Legrand's biography, with one or two sharp observations, relating in particular to his craftsmanship and technique, followed by a three-page chronological table and 68 plates of drawings and etchings. Bacou favors the more crumbling ruins and the more complex decora- tive compositions, those in which the scent of decay is already redolent. The four Grotteschi and the SADG "Crowning in glory" are better reproduced here than anywhere else and constitute the raison d'etre of the whole enterprise. More's the pity, therefore, that she has overlooked the so-called Caduta di Fetonte in both her text and amongst her plates. Nicholas Penny aspires to a virtuoso performance and his text, though no longer than Roseline Bacou's, is brisker and more pointed, reinforced and extended by lengthy captions to his illustrations, go in all. These too are chosen with an alertness and an unusually heightened sense of the artistic qualities not only of Piranesi, but of those artists and architects who were his contemporaries. The range is admirable, the reproduction indifferent. Penny too, omits the Cadute di Fetonte. In commenting on the SADG drawing he makes the startling suggestion that it might be that presented by Piranesi to Jacques Saly in 1746, on his recovery from an illness, last recorded at the sale of Saly's goods in I776. The representa- tion is more full blown than one might expect of a get-well card, but this disclaimer might be no more than a failing in our own emotional re- sponsiveness, and Penny might well be right in his surmise. Other issues have not always engaged him to such stimulating effect. He is not always as well-informed as he might be and on occasion is too cavalier in his judgements; there are inconsistencies in his text and on several issues, such as Legeay's activities, he is muddled, indeed wrong. Ultimately, the book must be judged as too short and derivative to be of more than passing interest. The two larger biographies are, in their own way, even more disap- pointing, though both are serviceable and likely to remain the best avail- able for many years to come. The first to appear was Jonathan Scott's Piranesi, of 1975. This has something of the thrust and independence of a pioneering work, for though the new documentation it provides is marginal, it clearly involved a most thorough reassessment of all avail- able information relating to Piranesi and a hard look at his works. John Wilton-Ely, the author of the second study, The Mind and Art of Gio- vanni Battista Piranesi, of 1978, has worked with equal diligence, per- haps more, but he has less sense of the gusto and variety of Piranesi's performance, less awareness of the forces and influences that shaped Piranesi's career. Here Jonathan Scott would seem to come into his own. He has tried with more determination than most recent authors to find out about Piranesi's contemporaries and the context he thus provides gives to his study an added dimension. He has though, not done enough. Inevitably, the two books must be compared. Both are no more than biographies, whatever enhanced interpretation might be hinted at in the title of John Wilton-Ely's. Their chapter headings offer the most direct means of comparison. There are ten in Jonathan Scott's: Early life; Views of Rome; The Capricci; The Antiquities and Lord Charlemont;</page><page sequence="4">336 JSAH, XLI:4, DECEMBER 1982 The Antichita Romane; The Greek controversy; The archaeological works; Works of architecture and design; The last years; Piranesi the artist. John Wilton-Ely has seven chapters: Apprenticeship: Venice and Rome, 1720-1750; The Vedutista; The artist and archaeologist; Con- troversy; The fever of imagination; Freedom in design; The closing years. Both works are well-illustrated throughout, Jonathan Scott's with more visual discernment, but John Wilton-Ely's has the advantage here. Scott includes both states of the Carceri in full page reproductions and although Wilton-Ely illustrates only the second state, he has as well the Vedute di Roma in full, the title page, the frontispiece and all 13 5 plates. This might not be the most stirring of Piranesi's suites, but it has been the most constantly admired. Jonathan Scott's writing is livelier and more easily read; at times his style may be judged a little too easy. He is especially good at recounting quarrels, that with Lord Charlemont in particular. He has not com- pacted quite as much information between his covers as John Wilton- Ely, but he has been more judicious in its selection and he has attempted, as noted already, to provide more than the usual amount of information on Piranesi's contemporaries. But here, as already noted, neither author has done enough. Wilton-Ely is decidedly shaky. On the first page of his text he refers to Carlo Lodoli as Pietro and calls him a Dominican priest; two pages later he recounts that Piranesi went to Rome in 1740 in the retinue of Marco Foscarini, whereas Professor Haskell, to whom he refers in the relevant footnote, correctly records that Foscarini's embassy dated from 1737 to 1740. Piranesi, as Alessandro Bettagno has noted, was probably a member of Francesco Venier's embassy, lasting from October 1740 to the winter of I743. The mistakes do not come quite so thick and fast in the rest of John Wilton-Ely's work. Jonathan Scott also has an array of errors, tedious to recount, though one or two, even of the minor sort should be noted. The Chinea, for example, did not stop in 1776; it was not recorded in engravings in that year, but it was staged and recorded in both 1777 and I778. More relevant is the consideration of the role of Legeay, which is yet again wrongly interpreted, with far too much reliance on John Harris' wilful deductions, though these have often enough been thrown in doubt. One of the cornerstones of John Harris' dating of the Legeay etchings is a handful of sketches relating to them in Sir William Chambers' Italian sketch-book. These, as a visit to the Victoria and Albert Museum would have revealed, are pasted into the sketch-book together with much other matter long post-dating Chambers' Italian visit and cannot be used as proof of an early date for the compositions of the engravings. It is fair to note that Gilbert Erouart, the authority on Legeay, has been equally remiss in making the pilgrimage to the Victoria and Albert; but he is not guilty in assuming, as Jonathan Scott does, that the trunk of drawings, probably by Legeay, which were in Francesco Piranesi's possession at the time of his flight from Rome, are a legacy from Legeay's early stay in Rome. Indeed, Erouart has shown in an addendum to the published papers of the colloquium, Piranese et les francais, that Legeay returned to Rome just before he died, as he intended, and suggests that the trunk of drawings came only then into the possession of the younger Piranesi; a conclusion he has reinforced with even more evidence in his L'archi- tecture au pinceau: Jean-Laurent Legeay. Un piranesien franqais dans l'Europe des lumieres, of 1982. Omissions of pertinent information are often of even greater import than errors of fact. Neither Scott nor Wilton-Ely is familiar with the world of litterati and scholars in the Veneto, in particular with the details of Scipione Maffei's and Matteo Lucchesi's ideas as to the origins and activities of the Etruscans, which might be thought of relevance to Pira- nesi's later controversy. Nor is mention made of the fact, recorded by Andrea Memmo, that Piranesi sent to Lodoli a copy of the Della mag- nificenza ed architettura de' Romani, a work that Jonathan Scott con- siders to have been aimed specifically at Winckelmann. Manlio Bru- satin's penetrating analysis of some of the intellectual preoccupations of the period, Venezia nel settecento: stato, architettura, territorio was published only in 1980. The catalogue of the exhibition on which it was based, however, Illuminismo e architettura del '700 veneto, appeared in I969, and there were enough indications in that to suggest that further research was required on Piranesi's Venetian background. Piranesi's Roman milieu is likewise blithely neglected. The attribution by Werner Korte and Hans Volkmann of 7 via de Prefetti in Rome to Piranesi is ignored. The authors' knowledge of archaeological investigation in I7th- and i8th-century Rome is all too obviously inadequate to the task of assessing Piranesi's contribution. This is the more surprising, in the case of Wilton-Ely, in that he is much concerned to establish Piranesi's importance as an archaeologist. Both authors, however, seem still to believe that artists do not think; they hold to the old belief that Piranesi was neither a scholar nor a thinker, that he was the dupe rather of a group of Roman bigots who used him as a mouthpiece to further their own ends. This will not do, as Werner Oechslin and others have recently demonstrated. In fact it has for some time been an untenable point of view. Piranesi might often have been misguided, but he was active and enthusiastic in his investigations and quite determined to propagate his own strongly held beliefs. And his beliefs were part of a long tradition of archaeological exploration in Rome. Not only intellectualism, but speculation too, seems to be profoundly disturbing to both Scott and Wilton-Ely. Scott deals summarily with Piranesi's early works, largely, one suspects, because he will have nothing to do with psychological interpretations. He abhors, sensibly, any no- tion that there might be a connection with drugs, and wants no part of Piranesi's hermetic associations, though he is prepared, grudgingly, to concede that the Grotteschi and the Caduta di Fetonte might be poetic images related to the musings of the Arcadians in the Bosco Parrhasio. Wilton-Ely, almost as fearful of explorations of the mind and extended meanings, had, whatever his animadversions, at least made a brave attempt to deal with the issue of masonic symbolism in an article, pub- lished in Apollo in I976, "Piranesian symbols on the Aventine." He seems though, in retrospect, to have been taming the theme then in preparation for his book, rather than enlarging it. These two works, it must be evident, are summations of established knowledge and approved interpretations; they do not extend under- standing of Piranesi or enhance sensibilities. Centenary Exhibitions, 1978 In this last respect the spate of Piranesi centenary exhibitions was more successful, in that they focused attention on his works. The only compre- hensive one was that organized by John Wilton-Ely himself, in London, in I978. This was wonderfully broad in its scope, comprising 357 items in all, providing a survey not only of Piranesi's activity in its many different forms-drawings, etchings, buildings, furniture and fake an- tiques-but including also the works of those artists by whom he was influenced and those, in turn, who were inspired by him, from Giuseppe Valeriani to Victor Hugo. Piranesi was presented as a lode-star of the Enlightenment, who impinged on the Romantic movement. The selec- tion of exhibits was careful and balanced and strangely predictable. There were no surprises, unless it be the sheer vigor of Piranesi's output- especially in his fantastical furniture for Cardinal Rezzonico-set in comparison with that of a whole array of his contemporaries, many of whom one might have expected to appear no less vigorous and exu- berant. The energy of Piranesi was overriding. The catalogue, though sparsely illustrated and now of limited interest, was commensurate with the judiciousness of the enterprise; there was no proselytizing, no new interpretations offered, all was thoughtful and measured and, on the whole, accurate. The importance of English patronage in Piranesi's career was made quite evident, serving to counteract the recent dominance accorded to the French connection. It was in London, as Piranesi con- fided to his sister late in life, that he would choose to settle if he were allowed the choice. More restricted in range, but scarcely less comprehensive in their own way, were the two exhibitions (and a ritual conference, yet unpublished) organized by Alessandro Bettagno at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini in Venice, also in I978-"Piranesi: incisioni, rami, legature, architetture," and "Disegni di Giambattista Piranesi." The aim of both, quite simply,</page><page sequence="5">was to show that the touchstone of all Piranesi's creative endeavour lay in Venice; that though Rome might have provided the substance for his vision, his interpretation of it can be understood only in relation to his Venetian inheritance. His language remained essentially Venetian. And this heritage Piranesi himself recognized and grasped only after he re- turned to Venice from Rome and saw in the work of Tiepolo, in particu- lar, that fluency and transparency of style that is so much a part of the vision of the Veneto. The argument is persuasively put. But the real impact of the exhibitions was made rather by the formidable array of Piranesi's work on display, especially the 85 drawings, which were as- sembled from collections the world over, including elusive examples such as those belonging to Sven Gahlin at Bath and the Earl of Verulam at St. Albans. The catalogues, profusely illustrated, if poorly printed, are altogether useful records of the events and were clearly designed to maintain their usefulness long after the ending of the exhibitions. They were designed moreover to complement one another: the catalogue re- lating to the drawings has a good bibliography, arranged alphabetically; that relating to the etchings has a more extensive one, well-nigh compre- hensive, compiled by Marina Magrini, arranged chronologically. The first of Piranesi's drawings to enter a public collection was that acquired in 1840 by the British Museum. As late as I961, when an exhibition of Piranesi's drawings was first assembled, at Turin, it was still assumed that they were of interest primarily as preparatory studies for his etchings. Now they are regarded as works of art in their own right. The first intimation of this came for many-and certainly for himself according to Alessandro Bettagno-when in 1948 Felice Stampfle published an article in the Art Bulletin on the drawings in the Pierpont Morgan collection. Though most of the drawings were discussed at that time barely a third were illustrated. It was only four years ago that a fully illustrated catalogue of this extraordinary collection of Piranesi draw- ings was published; the author was once again Felice Stampfle. This catalogue, like the author's earlier study, will no doubt serve as the basis for all future study of Piranesi as a draughtsman. The collection, over zo drawings in all, is the largest in the world, and extends from his earliest work to his latest, including both sketches and finished draw- ings in the full range of media he is known to have employed. The reproductions in the catalogue are relatively good, the price most rea- sonable. Another early admirer of Piranesi's drawings to whom Bettagno makes acknowledgement is Hylton Thomas, who published his book on Pira- nesi as a draughtsman a few years after the appearance of Stampfle's article. The Venice exhibition is by way of a tribute to both these schol- ars. But though Bettagno might admire the artistic qualities of Piranesi's drawing, he offers a caveat, and one that is seriously intended; the draw- ings are essentially those of an architect, not those of an artist, and must be judged accordingly. Perhaps, it is hinted, this limitation was accepted by Piranesi himself, who continued through life, doggedly, to sign him- self architetto veneziano. But there are more significant implications to this steadfast concern with architectural invention, and they are care- fully explored in the exhibition, starting with a rude recording of Theo- doric's tomb in Ravenna, from the Courtauld collection, through the Venetian fantasies, on to the spatial evocations of the Carceri, on through the years of the Roman ruins to the stiff and harsh depictions of Pompeii. The great drawings of the Paestum temples could not be borrowed from Sir John Soane's Museum, but those from the Rijksmuseum and the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris were included. What the catalogue reveals is something of the history of the collecting of Piranesi drawings. One that belonged to Piranesi's friend Bartolomeo Cavaceppi is now in Berlin; the six in the Earl of Verulam's possession were bought in Rome from Piranesi by the earl's ancestors Edward Walter and his wife. Slightly later collectors of Piranesi's drawings were Ernst George Harzen (I790o-863) and Ludwig Hermann Philipi (I848-I909), whose collections are now in museums in Hamburg and Berlin. The drawings that once belonged to Bishop Gott also have some- thing of a provenance. But not enough of the history of the thousand- odd drawings now attributed to Piranesi is known, though just enough, BOOK REVIEWS 337 one might think, for something of a critical appraisal to have been at- tempted. There are several drawings in established collections that must raise doubts as to their authenticity. An investigation of that nature was not, however, Bettagno's concern. The catalogue remains thus a medley. The exhibition of Piranesi's etchings that Bettagno arranged at the same time was similarly wide if not conclusive. There were over 400 etchings on display, including some of the more famous early suites- such as the Capricci, the Prima parte and the Carceri-in their entirety, and a generous selection from all other established suites. In addition there were a number of less well-known oddities and rarities-no less than six catalogues, dating from 1761 to 1778, of Piranesi's publica- tions; his view of the Villa dell'Ambrogiana from Giuseppe Allegrini's collection of Tuscan villas, dating from I744; his contributions to the Nolli maps of the Tiber and of Rome of I744 and I748, his etchings for Robert Mylne and Robert Adam, and more besides. The catalogue, in which the items are arranged more or less chronologically, is made up of no less than 33 introductory notes or essays written by a most formid- able assembly of Piranesi scholars-Carlo Bertelli, Bettagno himself, Maurizio Calvesi, Maria Catelli-Isola, Jorg Garms, Alvar Gonzalez- Palacios, Katharina Mayer-Haunton, Augusta Monferini, Roberto Pane, Andrew Robison, Manfredo Tafuri, John Wilton-Ely and Silla Zamboni-each of whom provides a summary history and a bibliog- raphy for the particular etching or suite of etchings they are presenting. Most of Piranesi's output is thus expertly and deftly handled, including even the engravings after Guercino, though not, surprisingly, that late enterprise, the survey of the Villa Adriana. The result is a useful source of reference with much new precision in dating, reinforced by almost 500 illustrations of Piranesi's work or documents closely related to them. Seven portraits of Piranesi are illustrated. At the end are nine contempo- rary bindings of Piranesi's works, designed in the main for members of the Rezzonico family, and an array of illustrations relating to an essay by Manfredo Tafuri on Santa Maria del Priorato. This is the longest and most sustained of all the essays, and it is also one of the most surprising, for Tafuri aims at judiciousness rather than enterprise. The liveliest of the essays are those by Maurizio Calvesi on the Caduta di Fetonte and Augusta Monferini on the Antichita Romane. Calvesi expands on the interpretation he offered when the unfinished plates were first exhibited in Rome in I965. The allegory depicted, he believes, derives from the writings of Mario Guarnacci, in particular from ideas contained in his Delle origini italiche, published only in 1767, but outlined in an earlier publication of I747. Phaeton, it seems, comes to earth in the Po valley, but though he might imagine himself the harbinger of the glories of Greek civilization he is overwhelmed by the greatness already in evi- dence in this realm of the early Italians. The lesson is clear. Italian civilization preceded and was independent not only of that of Greece, but also of Egypt and Babylon. The Caduta di Fetonte is thus to be seen as yet another element in Piranesi's visign of the primal glory of Rome. Augusta Monferini takes up this theme yet again, relating it to the pro- paganda aims of Piranesi's protector Bottari in her note on the Anti- chita Romane, which serves also as an excursus on the history of early archaeological activity in Rome. This should be read in conjunction with Werner Oechslin's several writings on the subject. Mention should also be made of two essays in this catalogue by Alvar Gonzalez-Palacios, one concerning the Diverse maniere . . ., another on the Vasi, candelabri, cippi, sarcophagi, tripodi, lucerne ..., which offer an analysis of Pira- nesi's taste in interior design, in strong contrast, it is suggested, to that of Winckelmann, though no proper discussion of the respective influences of Winckelmann and Piranesi in the fashioning of the rooms of the Villa Albani is entertained. This is a vexed problem and one on which it is perhaps unwise to speculate. The documents included in the recently published II Cardinale Alessandro Albani e la sua villa (prefaced by Giulio Carlo Argan) add no new information on the genesis of the villa; they all date from I790 and later. P. C. Bol and H. Beck's Forschungen zur Villa Albani is not yet available. The only newly published evidence to indicate a direct connection between Piranesi and the Albani, are drawings for two bookplates by Piranesi for an Albani cardinal, included</page><page sequence="6">338 JSAH, XLI:4, DECEMBER 1982 in Felice Stampfle's catalogue of drawings in the Pierpont Morgan Li- brary. What Alvar Gonzalez-Palacios does draw attention to, once again, as a putative interior by Piranesi, is that depicted in a painting by Laurent Pechaux, signed and dated Rome 1777, first identified by Mario Praz as that designed for the Marchesa Gentili Boccapaduli. The furniture shown is certainly sufficiently curious to have been conceived by Piranesi, but that is all one can say. The last of the Piranesi centenary exhibitions of 1978 was that of the early architectural fantasies, displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. This carefully selected and surely commented exhibition, arranged by Andrew Robison, has been noted already. Rome 1979 The Piranesi extravaganza staged in Rome in 1979 was of a wide- ranging and imaginative kind. No attempt was made to offer a compre- hensive survey of his work; instead five separate exhibitions dealing with aspects of his activity were set up in different locations that seemed most appropriate, hence, Piranesi nei luoghi di Piranesi. The plates from the Carceri and the panoramic views from the Vedute di Roma were displayed in the Castel Sant-Angelo; the Diverse maniere d'adornare i cammini in the cloister of the Istituto di Studi Romani, just behind Santa Maria del Priorato, which was made freely accessible for the occasion; Piranesi's representations of archaeological excavations, selected largely from the Antichita Romane, were shown in the Orti Farnesiani, adjoining the Campo Vaccino; the copper plates for the Caduta di Fetonte and other such examples of technical experimentation or prowess, were on show at the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica- Calcografia; while the etchings of the antiquities of the Lazio were to be seen, most suitably, in the buildings of the old convent of S. Oliva, now the library of Cori. There were in addition, no less than two conferences, one held in Rome on the theme "Piranesi e la cultura antiquaria," the other at Cori, on Piranesi's activity as an architect. These are yet unpub- lished. The five catalogues that were published for the exhibitions have since been issued together in a single volume, now with a table of con- tents, but without the catalogue of a sadly lacklustre exhibition of latter- day architectural fantasists-Ugo La Pietra, Paolo Portoghesi, Aldo Rossi, et al.-held at the same time at Cori. The whole is somewhat daunting. Apart from prefaces, introductory niceties and catalogue notes, there are no less than 45 essays by zz different authors. Each has something of interest to say, though sometimes not enough to warrant yet another compilation of facts on their several themes. The least rewarding of the catalogues is that from the Calcografia, which does include some intriguing photography showing enlargements from Pira- nesi's plates, but is made up for the most part with a tendentious essay by Luca Maria Patella on the composition of the Caduta di Fetonte, to- gether with an Italian rendering of the article "Gravure" from the Encyclopedie. The catalogue of the Aventine exhibition, though it includes some excellent illustrations of Santa Maria del Priorato, is simi- larly disappointing. But not so the other three catalogues, each of which has something special to offer. The Lazio catalogue provides a great deal of information not readily available elsewhere. The full text and plates of L'Emissario del Lago di Albano; Di due spelonche ornate dagli antichi alla riva del Lago di Albano; Le antichita d'Albano e di Castel Gan- dolfo and the Antichita di Cora are reproduced, together with detailed photographs of the sites and most of the antique fragments depicted by Piranesi, which are still scattered around them. Piranesi's curious com- bination of accuracy of representation and dramatic enhancement is at once made apparent. The wonder of his vision is here laid bare. No further explanation or analysis is needed and none is provided. Onofrio Speciale's four factual and terse essays on the history of the sites are models of tact, reinforced (perhaps with wry intent) by a diagram and a short note on the exploration of the outlet of the Lago di Albano, repro- duced from the Notiziario del Circolo Speleologico Romano (I959). Mention should be made here of another recent publication that reveals the essential verisimilitude of Piranesi's etchings, Herschel Levit's Views of Rome, then and now, 41 etchings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, corresponding photographs and text, (I 976). The etchings were selected from the Antichita Romane, the Opera varie and the Vedute di Roma. Levit found that the span of Piranesi's views was all too often 80?, and also that Piranesi's detailing was throughout extraordinarily accurate. He concluded that Piranesi must have made many more detailed draw- ings than have survived or than he is usually credited with. Sadly, none of the photographs was taken by moonlight, an effect much favored, ac- cording to Legrand, by Piranesi. The last two catalogues from the Roman exhibitions, more specula- tive in tone, offer interpretations of some of Piranesi's work based on new studies. That commemorating the Orti Farnesiani exhibition in- cludes an unpretentious but altogether compelling account by Patrizio Pensabene on that late-I7th century, or rather I8th-century taste for assembling and composing groups of antique sculpture and architec- tural fragments in the entrance courts of Roman patrician palaces which was to be given a new focus with the excavations conducted on the Palatine for the Farnese family by Fausto (?) Bianchini, the details of whose finds were recorded by Piranesi in the Trofei di Ottaviano Au- gusto and in various plates of the Magnificenza e architettura dei Ro- mani before being dispersed in the Farnese collections. The other essay of note, by Werner Oechslin, is also concerned with Francesco Bianchini and his excavations, or rather with that daring and influential recon- struction based on his excavations that was published, posthumously, in 1738 as Del palazzo de Cesari. Oechslin reproduces not only a number of Bianchini's plates but also a number of his original sketches, made on the site. His study is something of a revelation on the method and scope of early I8th-century archaeology, and though skill in representation might have been failing in the case of Bianchini, it is clear that he and others like him influenced Piranesi positively and largely. Oechslin's essay, rather too hurriedly written, may be read in conjunction with a more circumstantial essay on 8th-century archaeology in Rome, in the same catalogue, by Luisa Musso; though it is best read as an appendix to his own paper on the subject delivered at the conference Piranese et les francais in Rome, I976. The catalogue of the Castel Sant'Angelo ex- hibitions contains a series of five related essays on the Carceri by Mau- rizio Calvesi, one by Sabino Iusco on Piranesi's etchings of the Castel Sant'Angelo, a short but sharp review by Augusta Monferini on the state of current research on the dating of the Vedute di Roma, followed by a flurry of i i essays by Paolo Marconi on particular sites in Rome re- corded by Piranesi, some more than once. These last commentaries, as one might expect from the author of the standard monograph on Giu- seppe Valadier, are concerned rather more vitally with Valadier's pro- posals for the transformation of the sites than with Piranesi's recordings, though the projects of other planners and architects are also dutifully and most usefully illustrated. The real contribution however, is that of Maurizio Calvesi. Returning to the theme he first explored in I967 in the introduction to the Italian edition of Focillon's work, he demonstrates, altogether convincingly, that the plates of the Carceri are to be interpreted not as drug-induced hallucinations or simply as dream architecture, but rather in relation to contemporary notions on the origins of Roman justice and law. They are very much part of Piranesi's vision of ancient Rome and are thus an aspect also of his belief in the primacy of Rome rather than that of Greece. They require to be considered in conjunction with the text of Della magnificenza. The spur to their inspiration, Calvesi believes, is to be found in the writings of Mario Guarnacci, secretary to Carlo Rez- zonico and one of the Arcadians, who in turn resorted to the writings of Gravina, and in particular to his Origines Juris Civilis of 1713. Both authors, of course, derived their notion of Roman history from Livy. Two at least of the inscriptions that appear in the revised version of the Carceri relate to episodes of Roman justice as recorded by Livy (including the building of the Mamertine prison and the Tullianum); another group of names, also appearing only in a plate from the revised Carceri, refer to those men named by Tacitus as having plotted against the tyranny of Nero, including amongst them Seneca's brother. Nero, of course, was not only mindless of the traditions of Roman justice, but</page><page sequence="7">also a philhellene. Calvesi acknowledges Silvia Gavuzzo's contribution in furthering this analysis, but he disregards and thus implicitly dismisses her suggestion that Piranesi's intellectual explorations are embodied in the revised state of the Carceri alone. Whether made explicit or not, Calvesi believes, the Carceri are from the first concerned with a vision of antique Rome. Equally important in the evolution of this vision are the writings of Montesquieu, his Considerations sur les causes de la grandeur des romains et de leur decadence (1734) and De l'esprit des lois (I748), in which Gravina is cited again, and also, one might scarcely be surprised to learn, the works of Vico. Ideas contained in the Principii di una scienza nuova and II diritto universale on the origins of Roman institutions-especially as they were interpreted and vigorously defended by that follower of Vico, Bernardo Tanucci, who from I743 at least was in close contact with Piranesi's protector Giovanni Gaetano Bottari and was also a founder member of the Accademia Etrusca di Cortona-are vital not only to Piranesi's concept of Roman justice as it was explored in the plates of the Carceri; they are also crucial to an understanding of his polemical stance in the Greek and Roman controversy. Tanucci, Calvesi further notes, was responsible for persuading Charles III of Naples to appoint as his librarian another founder of the Accademia Etrusca, Marcello Venuti, brother of Ridolfino Venuti, superintendant of the antiquities of Rome and a close associate of Piranesi. Under Tanucci's influence Marcello Venuti furthered the excavations at Herculaneum, in particular from 1738 to 1740, just before Piranesi's visit, and advised on the publication of the finds. Tanucci was to be vigorously attacked by Winckelmann in his Sendschreiben an den Reichsgraven von Briihl of 1762 and by Baretti in the Frusta letteraria of 1763, to which Piranesi responded in 1769 in that notorious tailpiece in the Diverse maniere in which he also, and more conspicuously, made his thrust against Cap- martin de Chaupy's archaeological pretensions. Another example of Piranesi's scatological jibing recently recognized and more directly con- cerned with the Carceri should, perhaps, be noted here. In a footnote in his Venezia nel settecento: stato, architettura, territorio, (I980), Manlio Brusatin reveals (368 n.z) that Piranesi was not, as has been so often and unconvincingly suggested, unable to spell his print dealer Bouchard's name when he chose to sign some of the early plates of the Carceri with the name Buzard; he was rather saying what he thought of him. Buzard in Venetian dialect means "bugger." Piranesi was clearly concerned in the Carceri with a great many issues, not least with contemporary parallels to the tyranny of Nero (whether in the form of injunctions against the freemasons in Rome, as Silvia Ga- vuzzo has suggested, or with simple injustice in Naples, as Calvesi opines), set in contrast to the virtues of the associates of Seneca, whose De clementia was certainly of interest to the Arcadians even before it was acclaimed, most notably, in Cesare Beccaria's De delitte e delle pene of I764. But though Calvesi explores intellectual preoccupations of this kind at some length he is not concerned simply to pin-point the ideas that might have sparked off Piranesi's visions. Rather he shows how the etchings may be related to the remains of those buildings which were regarded then as the focus and embodiment of Roman law and order, the Tullianum and the Mamertine prison, surviving in part in the crypts of SS. Luca and Martina and more especially San Giuseppe dei Falegnami, on the edge of the Campo Vaccino, beneath the Capitoline hill. Calvesi first made this proposal in I967; now he demonstrates its significance most forcefully with a series of comparisons between carefully com- posed photographs of the small chapels under San Giuseppe dei Fa- legnami and selected plates from the Carceri (from both the early and the revised states). The scale of the architecture depicted in the etchings is, of course, far greater than that of the real buildings, but there is a remark- able concordance between the forms and the elements depicted in both. Calvesi's case can be taken to have been proven-though Brusatin will no doubt continue to prefer to associate the Carceri with the arsenal in Venice. Calvesi also proves by photographic comparison another of his postulates (and there has been many a doubting Thomas) that the lion relief shown in plate V of the revised state of the Carceri is an illustration of a Roman relief excavated at the Villa Adriana and recorded in Ri- BOOK REVIEWS 339 dolfino Venuti's guide of 1766 as being in the Palazzo Barberini, where it still is. Similarly, other reliefs included in this same etching are shown to have been copied from those on the columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. The romanita of the Carceri can no longer be in doubt. Separate Studies: The Carceri and Paestum Something of Calvesi's Roman exploration is attempted also in William MacDonald's Piranesi's Carceri: Sources of invention, the text of a lec- ture delivered at Smith College in 1978. Professor MacDonald's range of reference to Roman remains is wider than that of Calvesi. However, his interpretation is altogether more restricted, though it is fair to note that he does provide yet another set of comparative illustrations linking the Carceri and the Tullianum. Neither author has explored later associa- tions that might have concerned Piranesi in his evocations of the Mamer- tine prison. The prison was, in the 8th century, thought to have harbored both St. Peter and St. Paul and an annual pontifical mass, attended by the mem- bers of the Collegio dei Prelati, was initiated in the church of San Gui- seppe dei Falegnami to commemorate their incarceration on the sixth day of Ottavario 1743, just when Piranesi might be thought to have conceived the series of the Carceri. The second church that was thought to incorporate elements of the Mamertine prison, SS. Luca e Martina was the church of the Accademia di San Luca, of which Piranesi became a member in 1761, and at that time gave to the academy a set of plates of the Carceri. But these are no more than slivers of information that must be further explored if they are to mean anything. In view of the evident relationship between the etchings of the Carceri and the surviving embodiments of Roman justice and law it is surprising to find that so alert and sensitive an observer as Mario Praz should have declined to take up either Calvesi's provocative proposals of 1967 or Silvia Gavuzzo's reworking of them, in his otherwise altogether well- informed and intelligent introduction to the Rizzoli edition of the Car- ceri of 1975 in which all the plates from the two key states are well reproduced at a remarkably low cost. Praz, even more surprisingly, though he recognized that Piranesi was in all things an enthusiastic upholder of the myth of ancient Rome, thought that there were no veiled references, no mysteries to uncover in his art. Piranesi's vision was, he claims, direct and self-evidently expressed in his etchings. Praz did how- ever have lively interpretations of his own to offer. Piranesi, not Goya as Hans Sedlmayr has proposed, should be regarded as the true representa- tive of the loss of center; a man obsessed with the detritus of a destroyed world, conjuring it up endlessly with an infinity of spaces and forms, all without focus. There are other asides in Praz's introduction that require consideration, but its attraction lies rather in the fact that throughout, however wayward he might seem, he is concerned primarily with the quality of the works he is discussing. Erudition is sometimes secondary to this concern. Roberto Pane's book Paestum nelle acqueforti di Piranesi appears as a coherent and extended study of the Paestum etchings but is, in effect, a series of disparate investigations only indirectly related. There are six chapters in all; the first and by far the longest-it comprises half the book-includes the first Italian translation of Legrand's biography, slightly amended, together with the supplementary notes usually attrib- uted to E. Q. Visconti, here, as already noted, ascribed to Legrand. Pane provides a great number of footnotes by way of commentary, some redundant though some sharp and to the point, such as the suggestion that Piranesi's death might have been brought on by acid poisoning from the fumes of his inks and varnishes. This chapter is concerned also with the history of the Piranesi plates after his death and with the subsequent activities of his sons and daughter. Maria Catelli-Isola's essay "La cal- cografia Piranesi: rami originali" in the catalogue to the exhibition of etchings held in Venice in I978, together with an article by G. Pucci on Francesco Piranesi, published in Prospettiva in 1979, serve as the basis of Pane's account; but he adduces much else besides, including newly discovered documents in the Archivio di Stato in Naples that reveal that when Piranesi's sons fled from Rome to Paris in 1799, their boat was</page><page sequence="8">340 JSAH, XLI:4, DECEMBER 1982 captured by the English who returned them to Civitavecchia and seques- tered the zo precious crates of Piranesi plates, dispatching them to Rome and thence to Naples where they were inspected to ensure that nothing from the Stamperia Reale was being exported. The plates were returned to the Piranesis in Paris only in the second-half of i8oI. For two years the plates were thus not used, which suggests that the chronology of the first Paris printing needs revision-though how many of the plates were involved in the confiscation Pane does not specify. Francesco Piranesi's career in France-the opening in particular of his pottery manufacturing in I803-is also pursued. His career is much enlarged. The range of his works even is extended, at the expense of his father. Pane, reverting to an earlier attribution of Hind, on which he expands, suggests that the 1 drawings of Pompeii claimed by Hylton Thomas for Piranesi (six of which were exhibited in I978 in Venice, catalogued there as the work of Piranesi), together with three of the same kind in the Pierpont Morgan collection are in fact by Francesco-whatever Alessandro Bettagno or Felice Stampfle might think. Pane makes other suggestions for a revision of authorship-a drawing thought to be by Piermarini in the Biblioteca Civica at Foligno he credits to Piranesi; two drawings of theatrical pri- son interiors in the library at Caserta, usually thought to be by Vanvi- telli, he ascribes also to Piranesi. On another issue of identification, he is more uncertain. Though he correctly relates the etching "Veduta di un sepolcro antico, esistente in una vigna, per la strada di Tivoli ...," in the Antichita Romane, to the drawing in the Uffizi, sometimes thought to represent a mausoleum on the Via Appia, he seems unaware of Michael McCarthy's article "Sir Roger Newdigate: some Piranesian drawings" in the Burlington magazine of 1978, in which the drawing is identified as a view of the entrance to the site of the Villa Adriana before the "mausoleum" was converted by Piranesi into a house for himself. Pane's second chapter is similarly based on an extensive analysis of early documentation, in this instance the inventory of Piranesi's house and studio in Rome, drawn up after his death, from i to 3 December 1778. This inventory was the subject of some commentary by Franco Borsi in his notes to a reprint of the Campo Marzio in I972, but Pane's detailed enumeration goes further and elicits, among other items of information, the fact that Piranesi, like Carlevarijs and Canaletto, pos- sessed a "camera ottica," which he no doubt used. The inventory also reveals that though z views of Paestum are mentioned, only 8 plates are listed as the property of Piranesi, the remaining three, it is to be assumed, being regarded as the property of Francesco. The claim that Francesco was largely responsible for the engraving of two of the plates and the frontispiece to the suite was already advanced in Pane's note on the subject in the catalogue of etchings exhibited in Venice in I978; his fifth and sixth chapters are further and fuller explorations of this same theme. They serve, in effect, as a catalogue to both the Piranesi etchings of Paestum and 5 of the surviving drawings of the views, those in the Sir John Soane's Museum and that in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. The I6th drawing, that in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, though it is mentioned by Pane on page 124, is not reproduced and the plate in the suite to which it corresponds, plate XIX, is surprisingly captioned "manca il disegno." Pane has detailed suggestions as to which parts of which plates were engraved by Piranesi and which by Francesco. Pira- nesi is held to be responsible for virtually all the drawing, though Fran- cesco is credited with the etching of the frontispiece and most of plates X and XIII together with the figures throughout. The discussion on this subject is much complicated by reference to a sheaf of figure drawings by Piranesi, many of which relate directly to the Paestum etchings, recently found in the Biblioteca Estense at Modena, the subject of a paper by A. Cavicchi and S. Zamboni delivered at the Piranesi collo- quium in Venice in October 1978, but not yet published. Six of these drawings are reproduced by Pane. The conclusions offered, though they seem sufficiently firm, are clearly open to further inspection. It is fair to note though, that in the third and fourth chapters of his book Pane attempts a very careful and altogether thoughtful analysis of Piranesi's and Francesco's etching techniques, using as his starting point, as is his wont, a contemporary document, in this instance Abraham Bosse's Traite des manieres de graver en taille douce sur lairain, which, as he notes, was available to Piranesi only in French. Piranesi's marvellous technique of enhancing a view consists, he believes, not so much, if at all, in the distortion or magnification of elements depicted, rather in their dramatization by means of shading, especially by giving a strong, dark accentuation to the foreground and principal features. The book, though full of stimulus, is a mixed offering, neither a de- finitive analysis of the Paestum etchings, nor a full study of their posi- tion in relation to the earlier controversy concerning the primacy of Greece and Rome. Pane skirmishes with the affair. He notes Winckel- mann's reaction to Paestum in a letter to Bianconi, after a visit in 1758; he regards Piranesi's attack on Greek art as a thrust against Winckel- mann even more than an attack on Leroy and the French; he is mindful of Piranesi's dilemma-Piranesi's etching a perspective view and a care- fully drawn elevation of the Temple of Concord at Agrigento (which he had not even seen) for the Magnificenza . . .in 1760, providing an accompanying text which might seem in strong contrast to his sympa- thetic recording, yet continuing for years after to vent his spleen on the Greeks. Pane draws special attention to a letter on this subject, sent to Bernardo Tanucci in Naples in February 1762, which was published in 1979 in Le arti figurative a Napoli nel settecento, but which has not been much remarked. He records other pertinent items and argues that the Paestum etchings must be regarded as evidence of a profound change in attitude on Piranesi's part, a change from a baroque sensibility to a nobler, classical vision (even Piranesi's figures having ceased to have overtones of Magnasco; they cease even to gesticulate). Pane reproduces in full the French texts from the Paestum plates, but he provides no reading of them, nor does he note Piranesi's evasions there. Altogether he fails to grapple convincingly with the issue. Piranesi and the French Piranese et les francais, 1740-1790 is the catalogue of an exhibition devised by Georges Brunel and held, in I976, first at the Academie de France in Rome, then in Dijon and finally in Paris, for which were assembled almost zoo works by a range of French artists, both painters and architects, 50 in all (with Panini enrolled as an honorary French- man), set in comparison with a select range of Piranesi's drawings and etchings. The whole was stunning, the choice both judicious and enter- prising, and the catalogue, arranged by artists in alphabetical order from L. P. Baltard to Joseph Vernet was, when it first appeared, one of the most comprehensive and useful of references to these artists, in particu- lar to the works of such elusive provincial painters as A. Manglard from Lyon, L. F. Cammas from Toulouse and L. Chays from Marseilles (where he painted the decorative panels for Clerisseau's Chateau Borely). Many of the summary biographies and critical notes in the catalogue were written by scholars already actively researching their subjects, the more ready therefore to distinguish clearly and forcefully what mattered from what might be considered no more than com- pounded information. Care conditioned every entry. A measure of the intensity of I 8th-century studies in France is the extent to which many of the entries have already been superseded by more recent publications, usually of a fuller kind and more often than not by the author of the original notice. Thus the entry on L. P. Baltard, with which the catalogue begins, has been overtaken by articles by Therese de Puylaroque (Bulletin de la Societe de l'Histoire de l'Art Francais, Annee 1976, 1978) and Dominique Bertin (Travaux de l'Institut d' Histoire de l'Art de Lyon, no. 6, 1980), while to that on Barbault one must append Pierre Rosenberg's own notes, published with the papers delivered at the col- loquium accompanying the exhibition. Knowledge of Charles de Wailly is now focussed in the catalogue of the exhibition that Monique Mosser and others organized in Paris in I979; publication of Michel Gallet's recent book on C. N. Ledoux (Paris: Picard, ig8o) has rendered most earlier summaries of that architect's activity redundant, even mislead- ing; similarly Pierre Rosenberg has now provided an outline for the whole of L. J. Le Lorrain's career (Revue de l'Art, 40/4I, I978) that makes all other partial sketches, illuminating though they might once</page><page sequence="9">have been, irrelevant. Gilbert Erouart's notes on Legeay, though still an essential reference and of particular value in serving to demolish the myth of Legeay's exaggerated status, adducing amongst much other evidence that J. F. De Troy's oft quoted expression of praise-"de feu et du genie"-was no more than a cant phrase, used impartially of even lesser talents; these notes have been overtaken both by Erouart's presen- tation to the colloquium and by his recent monograph on Legeay, al- ready noted. But the lustre of the catalogue is little diminished. The notes on J. C. Bellicard and G. P. M. Dumont by Gilbert Erouart and Werner Oechslin, on B. M. Hazon by Erouart, on E. de Lavall&amp;e-Poussin by Pierre Ariz- zoli, on J. H. A. Pernet and J. J. N. Servandoni by Marianne Roland- Michel, and on L. F. Petit-Radel and B. Poyet by Monique Mosser retain their brilliance still and will ensure that the catalogue is consulted again and again. There are other excellencies, the most useful perhaps the bibliography-though it is surprising to find that Gianni Mezzanotte's chapter on E. A. Petitot in L'architettura neoclassica in Lombardia, of I966, has been overlooked-while the most enjoyable is the array of illustrations, including a number of the more lively Clerisseau draw- ings from Leningrad. One drawing by J. D. Dugourc is, unfortunately, reproduced upside down. There are disappointments, some unavoidable. Not much evidence of P. F. Duflos' activity has been adduced, nor have any of M. A. Challe's paintings of ruins come to light. The significance of Edme Bouchar- don's presence in Rome from 1723 to 1731 is noted, but his influence is not recorded to any resulting effect. Other lapses might have been avoided. For instance J. P. L. Hoiiel's wonderfully ingenious and mar- vellously convincing representations of underground excavations in Si- cily ought to have been displayed-though Hoiiel was not otherwise underplayed, one of his beautiful gouache and water colour studies of the fragments of the temples at Agrigentum being reproduced in colour on the cover. Hoiiel's archaeological representations might be judged to be independent of Piranesi's, but the refined and elegiac style that F. Hutin and L. F. J. Saly cultivated at the Academie de France in the i740s, however different it might be from that of Piranesi, is an integral part of any investigation of the relationship between these artists, and more might have been offered by way of an analysis of the Frenchmen's imagery. Several years after seeing the exhibition, while recalling the delight it aroused, and having confirmed by constant use the basic soundness of the catalogue, it is yet possible to suggest that the enterprise might have been more effective yet if fewer artists had been represented and the interaction between them and Piranesi more forcefully demonstrated. There are indications in the notes that any French painter who recorded ruins in Italy in the i8th century, any architect who indulged his fancy (even J. J. Lequeu whose actual copying from Piranesi is not in fact charted) was to be regarded as yet another actor in a great Piranesian saga. Many of the artists whose works were exhibited had little to do with Piranesi, and even less-the ruins apart-in common. The springs of their imaginations might have been stirred in much the same way as Piranesi's, but he should not thereby be thought to impinge on their creative endeavours. Piranesi was certainly the most powerful recorder of ruins in Rome, but he was not the only one. Nor was he always admired. Evidence is steadily emerging to demonstrate that whatever our estimation of his work might be, it was not that of the i 8th century. Many disliked the forcefulness of his representations. As Georges Brunel writes in his well-considered introduction to the catalogue, Winckel- mann preferred the mundanities of Clerisseau, while the Comte de Caylus, a man of fashion to his fingertips, writing to Pere Paciaudi on 24 February 1765, remarked, "Je pense absolument comme vous sur l'exces de l'encre et du foin de Piranesi; mais que voulez-vous? c'est sa maniere...." The French liked most the Prima parte. The effective Piranesian interactions have yet to be isolated with sub- tlety, though one of the contributors to the catalogue, Marianne Roland- Michel did demonstrate altogether effectively at the colloquium held at the time of the exhibition, how fine distinctions might be made between BOOK REVIEWS 341 those who had learned from Piranesi and those who had not. More of that sensitivity should have been brought to bear on the choice of exhib- its. This, of course, is to carp. The very real advantage of the breadth and range of the exhibits was the image conveyed of a sensibility shared, for a number of years, by both painters and architects in France-and indeed, in Italy. The architects, it is clear, gained most. And the painterly vision that they embraced, that grasp of the effect of qualities of light and shade on built forms, serving to establish a character and conjuring up moods, all this profoundly altered the nature of the architectural ideal that took shape at the end of the century. More than anything else, it is the trans- ference of the painterly vision to the realm of fantasy architecture that the exhibition triumphantly celebrated. Piranese et les franaais is the record also of a conference held in Rome, in May I976, at the time of the exhibition. The book contains z8 papers profusely illustrated, though the plates are arbitrarily cropped and badly reproduced. The papers are all of a serious and studied kind, each de- manding, indeed deserving of the fullest attention, though a number of the essays are no more than reworkings or updatings of episodes already explored by their authors on other occasions-John Wilton-Ely on the Graeco-Roman controversy, for instance; Thomas McCormick on Clerisseau; Jean-Marie Perouse de Montclos on the nature of i8th-cen- tury classicism; Pierre Rosenberg on Barbault; or Richard Wunder on the work of the French pensionnaires and Challe, in particular, whom he continues to regard as subservient, in all respects, to Piranesi. Other papers are very much in the nature of conference offerings, designed to stimulate thought and stir discussion and serve, as it were, as a commen- tary on a particular point of issue, without investigating it too far or fully illuminating the theme proposed. And here one might include Roseline Bacou on Piranesi's figure drawings (a theme followed up, equally in- conclusively, in Roberto Pane's book on Paestum), Allan Braham on Piranesi's influence on the French pensionnaires, Angela Cipriani on French influences in the Italian academies (where the long standing of the French connection with the Accademia di San Luca is not noted), Michel Gallet on the firework displays in the Place de la Greve in Paris, Johannes Langner on the view under the bridge, Sylvia Pressouyre com- paring the staccato application of ornamental details on Santa Maria del Priorato and the elements of the adjoining piazza with the devices ofJ. C. Delafosse, or Carlos Sambricio on Piranesi's influence in Spain. Yet other articles are independent studies, self-contained almost and only at some remove pertinent to Piranesi-though this is not to imply that their interest is marginal, only that they do not greatly enhance our under- standing of Piranesi. Two of these articles concern Roman villas, three explore French themes. Pierre Arizzoli-Clementel offers a meticulous reconstruction, based on drawings by Charles Percier and P. A. Paris and documents in the Vatican, of Antonio Asprucci's Stanza Egizia at the Villa Borghese as it was before the statuary was sold in 1807 to Na- poleon. Another attempt at the reconstruction of a Roman villa with the aid of drawings by P. A. Paris is Alain Gruber's evocation of the Villa Albani. But though the Paris drawings are indeed evocative and inspiring (and evidently not studied by Joachim Gaus for his Carlo Marchionni of 1967), they were never intended as faithful renderings, rather as fanciful reinterpretations which were reworked over a period of time and most probably in Normandy, where Paris was in hiding after the Revolution, not in Rome. Gruber offers little more than a commentary on a visual panorama. No new documentation of the forces and influences that conditioned the forms of the famous villa is presented. The remarkable fusion of different visions that make up the Villa Albani-conceived, as Gruber notes, as a counterpart to the Villa Adriana so much admired by Piranesi-and in which the Piranesian chord is struck again and again so that his influence seems immediate and palpable, remains as enigmatic as ever. We still do not know what part Piranesi might have played in its inspiration, indeed if his name need be mentioned even in that connec- tion. Two of the papers on French themes-perhaps the most provocative in the collection-certainly stir expectations, even if they do not fulfill them. Daniel Rabreau, investigating the relationship between stage set-</page><page sequence="10">342 JSAH, XLI:4, DECEMBER 1982 ting and town planning in late I8th-century France, shows himself mi- nutely informed and altogether knowledgeable, but equally, wilfully disdainful of any influence other than that of the theatre-and the French theatre specifically-when it comes to propounding his thesis, which is that the architectural vision imposed on French towns in the late I8th century and developed with even greater fluency in the drawings of those utopian architects whose works characterize the end of the period, was evolved first on the stage. It was a world conceived in impermanent form. The intermediaries who realized the vision were thus readily influ- enced by Piranesi. But clearly not by Piranesi alone. For some of the more potent designs that Rabreau discusses, such as one by Oppenord, dated 1734, owe nothing at all to Piranesi or to his influence. The thesis re- quires more complex analysis. More maverick are Serge Conard's specu- lations on a possible relationship between the anthropomorphic features in some of Piranesi's plans and the zodiacal figures that Conard discerns in the layouts of C. N. Ledoux's ideal town at Chaux-which connect, of course, with the Vitruvian account of the proper establishment of a town. Though much of Conard's discussion may be dismissed with good humored tolerance-or even intolerance-there are undoubtedly con- cerns in common in Piranesi and Ledoux, shared hermetic beliefs and underlying assumptions which need to be more fully explored. Our knowledge and understanding of the i8th century will have to change greatly though before we will be prepared to accept any such findings. The failings are in part those of traditional scholarship, not Conard's. On a different, decidedly more mundane level, is Olivier Michel's account of the Roman activity of J. B. Lallemand, an artist who was first brought to conspicuous attention in an exhibition arranged by Pierre Quarre at Dijon, in 1954, though one who has been recognized always as the principal draughtsman for J. B. de Laborde's Description generale et particuliere de la France (later the Voyage pittoresque de la France). Michel has new information to offer. Lallemand, it is now established, married an Italian girl in 1748 and had ten children by her; together they moved in 1758 into the Casa Tomati, into which Piranesi himself moved in 1761, but in that same year Lallemand returned to France. Lallemand, it seems, instructed Robert Adam in landscape painting in Rome-a fact, if true, is unrecorded by John Fleming, Adam's biographer. Several of the remaining papers presented at the colloquium in Rome have been mentioned earlier in this review-Gilbert Erouart's instruc- tive and useful account of J.-L. Legeay's activities; his presentation, together with Monique Mosser, of J. G. Legrand's life of Piranesi; Jorg Garms's determined attempt to date the Prima parte and Henry Millon's equally purposeful analysis of the making and the issue not only of the Prima parte but also of the early plates of Roma antica e moderna and the Antichita Romane. Yet another article may now be by-passed thus brusquely: Christian Elling's "Le sejour romain de Nicolas-Henri Jar- din," first published in Danish in 1943 as Jardin i Rom and though piously quoted since in serious bibliographies, clearly not often con- sulted. This was substituted for his own contribution by Svend Eriksen, by way of tribute to his mentor. Though dated and somewhat flawed the article emerges now as a perspicacious and surprisingly firm account of the interaction between Piranesi and the French pensionnaires in Rome in the middle years of the century. Christian Elling knew very few indeed of the Chinea designs by J. L. Le Lorrain, yet his assessment of the significance of the activities of French artists in those years is sharp and convincing still. There remain six articles to be considered, two by Werner Oechslin, "Le groupe des 'Piranesiens' francais (1740-1750): un renouveau artistique dans la culture romaine," and "L'interet archeologique et l'experience architecturale avant et apres Piranese"; one, alto- gether appropriately, by the editor of the whole, Georges Brunel, "Re- cherches sur les debuts de Piranese a Rome: les freres Pagliarini et Nicola Giobbe"; another on early visual influences on Piranesi, by Paolo Marconi, "Ricerca sulle fonti della cultura d'immagine piranesi- ana: la scala gigantesca e l'ornato allegorico degli anni '6o," yet another which relates to this discussion, Marianne Roland-Michel's "De l'illu- sion a 'l'inquietante etrangete': quelques remarques sur l'evo- lution du sentiment et de la representation de la ruine chez les artistes franqais a partir de 1730," and lastly, Madeleine Barbin's investiga- tion of the pattern of activity of French collectors of the works of Pi- ranesi. Together these artcles serve as the raison d'etre of the whole volume. Werner Oechslin's first article is perhaps best regarded as the latest in a series on its subject that begins with Christian Elling's account of N.-H. Jardin in Rome, is fuelled by the misleading asides on J.-L. Legeay made by Emil Kaufmann in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society in 195 , and continues with the work of John Harris and Svend Eriksen, recounting the myriad activities of the French pensionnaires in Rome. Oechslin has more information to offer than any of his predeces- sors, much of it apposite and vital, much of it redundant and repetitious. He begins, with due caution, by announcing that he intends to restrict his footnotes to new points of issue, studiously avoiding those that are repeated again and again by all other contributors to the colloquium. But he turns out to be more repetitious than any of them, not only in his footnotes but in his text. He is wordy and undisciplined. He labours to prove established facts. He notes the obvious and explores the cul de sac. Indeed he is intensely irritating to read and cannot always be relied on. But there can be little doubt that he knows the ground of his study better than anyone else and that he has done a great deal of painstaking and independent research. Moreover, he has a thesis to present. He regards the activities of the artists and architects in Rome in I73os as representa- tive of a change from a straightforward professionalism-painters aim- ing to paint pictures, sculptors to carve marble and architects to erect buildings-to a more complex culture in which aims and roles were not so clearly defined and were in any case overtaken by intellectual and academic aspirations. An elite of taste was seen to replace a cluster of professional elites. The thesis is not altogether convincing. And Oechs- lin's analysis of this process of change is, as already suggested, by no means simple. At times it is muddled. He tries, for instance to pursue his theme by tracing the evolution in design of a number of separate ele- ments-fountains, vases and window surrounds-but his analyses, far from serving to define the nature of taste at the time, merely obscure it, making it progressively less and less distinct. Nonetheless he says much that is pertinent and provides a gallimaufry of facts and illustrations that will serve to resolve many puzzles that others have merely remarked. He is able, for instance, to suggest Bouchardon's contribution to the devel- opment of taste by ascribing to him 14 drawings of vases in the Victoria and Albert Museum, previously credited to E.-A. Petitot. He demon- strates Legeay's debt to Lepautre. He illustrates what would appear to be the chapel G.-P.-M. Dumont designed for Consul Digne, outside Rome- though there is a problem of dating yet to be resolved. There are more details of this kind, and in this respect Oechslin's lapses are few-he seems not to have noted Fabia Borroni Salvadori's article on Markus Tuscher in the Miscellanea di studi in memoria di Anna Saitta Revignas of 1978, nor to have seen M.-J. Peyre's drawings for fountains in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. Oeschlin's second article is similarly by way of a continuation of a theme already explored, though in this instance he is his own precursor. His investigation into archaeological knowledge and attitudes in the Rome of Piranesi is a reinforcement of his own Bildungsgut und An- tikenrezeption des friihen Settecento in Rom, of I972. Once again he is overburdened with knowledge and writes with a compulsive frenzy that admits of little sustained thought, only brilliant asides. But he does demonstrate that there was a tradition of intelligent archaeological in- vestigation in Rome, dating back a century and more before Piranesi- Piranesi, for instance, could rely confidently on F. Nardini's Roma antica, published first in I665-that culminated in Francesco Bian- chini's spectacular restoration study, Del palazzo de'Cesari, published posthumously in Verona in 1738 (and dedicated, incidentally, to Louis XV). The manner of construing and delineating the buildings of antiq- uity that was so marvellously displayed there were soon taken up by Piranesi as his own. Like Bianchini he conceived of the ancient buildings</page><page sequence="11">of Rome as large and symmetrical, though he developed an ever greater concern for archaeological exactitude and an enhanced appreciation of antique forms. His conceptions were both more correct and more imag- inative. And this creative archaeological tradition, Oeschlin shows, suffused and influenced deeply the designs of such architects as M.-J. Peyre, J.-F. de Neufforge and J.-N.-L. Durand. Oeschlin's is a rich and disordered survey, at its best when he can bring his extraordinary range of knowledge to bear on a particular point, though even on matters of detail he is erratic-I am referred to in a footnote, for instance, as Robert Middleton and thanked for informing him of the fact that Jacques Gon- doin gave his measured drawings of the Villa Adriana to Piranesi, a fact noted as recorded by A.-C. Quatremere de Quincy in the Encyclopedie methodique, but appearing rather in his encomium on Gondoin read to the Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts in I821, to be published in a Recueil de notices historiques ... only in I834. Georges Brunel's contribution is, in contrast, limited in scope and modest in its aims, but altogether sound and greatly enlarging of our understanding of Piranesi's early Roman background. Brunel is con- cerned with the interconnections among Piranesi, Nicola Giobbe (to whom Piranesi first and fulsomely dedicated the Prima parte), and the publishers of that work, the brothers Nicola and Marco Pagliarini. He shows, altogether convincingly, that this youthful and enterprising group were anti-jesuit in their outlook, perhaps even jansenist in spirit, and under the protection of Cardinal Passonei. Giobbe has long been a mystery figure, characterized in many different and misleading ways, largely because information about him has been lacking. Brunel has now found his will, which he reproduces in full. Giobbe was born in 1705 in Rome, he died in I748. During Piranesi's early years in Rome he was, as Focillon has accurately recorded, an important contractor in the service of the Camera Apostolica. But he was no simple mason, rather a man of learning and taste, well-off if not affluent. He collected works of many contemporary painters, many of them veduta painters-G. P. Panini, Sebastiano Conca, Jan van Bloemen, Andrea Locatelli, Gaspare Vanvi- telli-and had a library of over 200o books, remarkable in its range, including most of the Greek and Roman classics and many modern French works. He owned most of the great i6th- and I7th-century architectural treatises-the works of Alberti, Palladio, Pirro Ligorio, Serlio, Vignola, Scamozzi, Borromini, Perrault, Desgodetz and Daviler- and many recent archaeological studies-works by Bianchini, Ficoroni, Fontana, Santi Bartoli, etc. though not Fischer von Erlach's history. He clearly enjoyed radical philosophical and scientific tracts-the Gram- maire de Port Royal, books by Galileo, Descartes, Leibnitz and Newton. All are listed in the will and have been carefully indexed for ease of reference by Brunel. The library gives evidence of Piranesi's possible early intellectual excursions. The Pagliarini brothers, it is now evident, provided an equally vital stimulus. Brunel has also discovered Nicola Pagliarini's will and repro- duces that too. The Pagliarinis were editors of the only literary journal in Rome, the monthly Giornale de' Letterati. They published a lot more besides, much of it of an enthusiastic kind. In 1760 Nicola-who lived, incidentally, in a house sited between the churches of SS. Luca e Martina and San Giuseppe de' Falegnami-was imprisoned and soon after exiled to Naples and then to Portugal for issuing a violently anti-jesuit tract (should this not, one is bound to ask, be linked to Calvesi's interpreta- tions and be connected with the overt attack on injustice evident in the plates added to the Carceri in 176I ?). In all this activity there are strong links with Winckelmann and C. G. Bottari. Brunel is disinclined to draw conclusions and is reluctant even to pursue the consequences of his discoveries, but his is a most revealing article-the most illuminating, one might opine, in the whole collection-that is demanding of further investigation and interpretation. It provides the first firm basis for any study of the intellectual context of Piranesi's early works. Paolo Marconi is more intent to explore the realm of meanings and suggestions, which he does altogether successfully in linking the her- metic symbolism of Tintoretto's paintings and one of Pianta's carved figures in the Scuola di San Rocco in Venice with that evident in Pira- BOOK REVIEWS 343 nesi's early Capricci and also in the decorations at Santa Maria del Priorato. The study is soundly based and has the added distinction of relating Piranesi's visual vocabulary and spatial compositions to those developed earlier by painters and other artists rather than to those of etchers alone. Far too many scholars consider Piranesi's works only in comparison with those of other engravers. Marianne Roland-Michel too shows herself more than usually sensi- tive to the relationship between Piranesi's imagery and that of other artists, painters especially, and in pursuing her study manages to distin- guish Piranesi's direct influence on other artists from that of his con- temporaries and predecessors. The painters of ruins did not all, by any means, derive their inspiration from Piranesi. His vision, the feelings he stirred, can be discerned and can be identified in some of their works, not in others. Amongst the French-and this is the tradition Marianne Roland-Michel investigates, though she surprisingly omits the works of the 17th-century artist, Jacques Rousseau in her summary history- Pierre Demachy is demonstrably not affected by Piranesi; Hubert Robert is influenced only to a very limited extent, his subject matter and compo- sitions owing more, as Herbert Burda has already indicated, to Panini. There is only rarely a sense of anguish or Piranesian disquiet in Robert's compositions. Similarly Fragonard, though his drawings might often appear to resemble Piranesi's, remains untouched by his spirit. And it is the power and nature of Piranesi's spirit, above all, that distinguishes his works from that of all his contemporaries. Very different, but equally thoughtful and precise in its estimation of French i 8th-century taste is Madeleine Barbin's systematic study of the catalogues of sales in Paris from I743 to I8zo. Piranesi's works were auctioned on at least 92 occasions during that period. His etchings first entered the Cabinet des Estampes in I754. One hundred and three owners can be identified. Financiers are amongst the most notable of collectors of his work; the greatest of all was Pierre-Jean Mariette. Dela- fosse owned most of Piranesi's etchings; other artists who held them were J. F. de Troy, J. Saly and C. M. A. Challe. Clerisseau seems to have owned only a handful of Piranesi's views of Rome. The choice of plates is perhaps of even greater significance. The most popular works collected were the Varie vedute di Roma and the Antichita romane de' tempi della repubblica. The Prima parte was included in z collections, the Carceri in about the same number. Piranesi's plates were not, on the whole, framed separately, but were bound together as books. He was viewed largely as an antiquary and archaeologist, his works only rarely being classified amongst those of artists. And the works of Bartoli and Barbault were preferred to his. The conclusions that may be drawn from evidence of this kind are, of course, limited-the information is derived almost exclusively from the records of sales, not from the catalogues of those who kept and handed down their Piranesis-but it is nonetheless representative of French habits and attitudes and is supported by the recorded opinions of French critics and connoisseurs. The 8th-century French estimation of Piranesi was very different indeed from our own. Piranesi has for long now been greatly admired; in recent years his works have been more diligently studied and catalogued than ever before. Re- search is just beginning to reveal something of his own tastes and con- cerns, and the Italian background to his activity is being tentatively- very tentatively-investigated. But it is clear that we still know very little indeed about him. No fully convincing analysis of his work and its context has yet been made. Interpretations, even of a very general kind, are rare. Indeed, the only one to have been published during the latest round of scholarly activity is Bruno Reudenbach's G. B. Piranesi: Archi- tektur als Bild-unless one is to consider also Norbert Miller's informed but tortuous exploration Archdologie des Traums: Versuch uber Giovanni Battista Piranesi of 1978, or Manlio Brusatin's thumb-nail sketch of the serious artist and archaeologist descending to the role of purveyor of kitsch for the rich bourgeoisie. Reudenbach regards Piranesi as the central figure in that change in architectural vision that marks the I8th century, a change from a professional concern for the built work to an overwhelming concentration on the architectural image itself; an</page><page sequence="12">344 JSAH, XLI:4, DECEMBER 1982 architecture of the mind to be given form, if at all, only in representations of fantastic and sublime splendor. He explores this theme with a certain brisk and brash confidence, starting, as one might expect, with Fischer von Erlach's Entwurffeiner Historischen Architectur and Giuseppe Gal- li-Bibiena's Architetture e prospettive, demonstrating how it is focussed early in that series of monuments Piranesi contrived for the background to the ancient circus that serves as the second frontispiece for the third volume of the Antichita Romane of I756. The evolution of this archi- tectural language in Piranesi's earlier works is investigated in subsequent chapters, as also is the theoretical stance that Piranesi came to adopt to support it; the whole to be modified and reinforced in turn in his encounters with the French pensionnaires, Louis-Joseph Le Lorrain in particular; but this extended too into the work of Charles Michel-Ange Challe and Hubert Robert (and also that of the Scotsman, Robert Adam), to emerge most effectively in the later years of the century in the con- trivances of Charles Delafosse (a number of whose drawings, both from the Musee des Arts Decoratifs and the RIBA Drawings Collection he reproduces for the first time), and also in the designs of Jean-Francois Neufforge; and so to C.-N. Ledoux's so-called "architecture parlante" and E.-L. Boullee's art of the overscaled image, both of which are accorded a chapter. The central chapter in the book, the longest and most serious (it is unillustrated), is concerned with attitudes to taste in the 8th century, especially attitudes to ornament. Piranesi's and Winck- elmann's writings are analyzed and contrasted, though, as Reudenbach shows, there are points in common. Piranesi's written beliefs do not, however, accord with his practice. The historical context for these be- liefs is provided first by the quarrels of the "ancients" and the "mod- erns," the establishment of custom as the only real criterion for taste, with Voltaire's famous Essai sur les moeurs et l'esprit des nations serving to provide a comprehensible and universal framework for the new atti- tudes. Surprisingly, Lodoli is not mentioned in this connection; nor, indeed, are any other Italian critics. This hints of one of the shortcomings of Reudenbach's work. It is all too general in its approach. His text was completed in 1977, before much of the research reviewed here had been published, so that many references that one might expect to find are not in evidence, but it is rather the summary approach of the author that has occasioned the bland and generalized tone of the whole. Remarks of an enveloping kind can certainly be made about I8th-century attitudes towards architecture, but Piranesi can be understood only if he is set first, carefully, within the context of the history of ideas expanding in Rome at that period, and it is doubtful if any transition can be made swiftly, and meaningfully, to Ledoux and Boullee (neither of whom went to Rome), unless their attitudes to architecture are also pains- takingly analyzed first within the context of French thought, from at least Claude Perrault onwards. A broad philosophical approach is in the spirit of the German critical tradition and it has often served its illu- minating purpose, but Reudenbach's essay-for that is what it is-can be regarded as no more than a gallant and creditable endeavour, rather like the work of some clever and well-informed student that demon- strates the range of his knowledge, but reveals little new. Piranesi's transposition of the baroque heritage into a tragic vision of the past, specifically Roman antiquity, that could be readily grasped and transfused by his contemporaries into their own work has not yet found its interpreter. Scholars as different as Andrew Robison, Maurizio Calvesi and Georges Brunel will have to work ever harder before anyone is able to make a convincing assessment.
