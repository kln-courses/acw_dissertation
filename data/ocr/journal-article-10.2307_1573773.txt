Printed in Great Britain A COMMENTARY ON KIRALYFALVI'S BOOK THE AESTHETICS OF GYORGY LUKACS Forrest Williams* 'Marxist theory of art' may mean either of two somewhat different things. Sometimes it stands loosely for any theoretical treatment of art that has been significantly affected by Marxist ideas. Treatments of this kind are numerous and include those by such thinkers as Arnold Hauser, Lucien Goldmann, Jean-Paul Sartre, Frederick Antal and even John Dewey. Or it may bear the stronger meaning of a treatment that emphatically aspires to extrapolate and develop Marx's philosophical originality in the realm of art and criticism. To further in this way an aspect of Marx's frame of reference, which was indicated only sketchily in the body of his writings, is the more difficult project. In his specifically theoretical discussions, most notable in Die Eigenart des Asthetischen (1963), Gy6rgy Lukacs was certainly a Marxist contender in the latter, strong sense. An initial difficulty, of course, is that Marx's writings are a living tradition, subject to varying interpretations. And even within a given interpretation, to elaborate or further a specific theme cannot be a simple mechanical extension of Marx's concepts. And there are, moreover, some typical ways to fail by now only too familiar, unfortunately. One is to politicize artistic norms, with a consequent automatic elevation of works that may be proletarian in content or origin. This is to conceive political activity in a pre-Marxist sense, as in Hobbes and other formal versions of social power. It is also, in its critical implications, to invite such counter-intuitive judgments as might rank 'Waiting for Lefty' above 'Midsummer Night's Dream'. Another way to fail is to attempt to reduce artistic activity to the social and economic base, purporting to understand works of art as mere epiphenomena. Yet another way is to simply add sociological or economic "filler" to the tradition of aesthetics that extends at least from Kant to the present. Each of these failures is common enough in the literature. Only if these failures are avoided is it possible for would-be Marxist theory of art, in the strong sense defined above, to face the really interesting and significant challenge: to recognize the validity of aesthetics, a pre- Marxist tradition of concepts, without lapsing into its traditionally idealist principles.From Kant to Croce, what we have come to know as 'aesthetics' has been a brilliant offspring of Enlightenment epistemologies. The consuming issue of theory of knowledge was to analyse how an individual conciousness succeeds in conceptualiz- ing the properties or laws of a given object of experience. Turning to the analysis of the art, these philosophers were preoccupied with an analogous moment: the individual *Aesthetician, Dept. of Philosophy, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80302, U.S.A. (Received 17 Jan. 1977). consciousness at the peak of its contemplative enjoyment of a sensuously and formally entrancing object. Within this epistemological inquiry, aesthetics dealt with the perspective provided by an ideal critic reflecting on and discoursing about a private, yet-given an ideal sensibility-authoritative appreciation. Its fundemental assumptions were perfectly ahistorical and asocial. The contrasting originality of Marxist thought, of course, derives from a basic change of perspective; the shift it proposes is from isolated and autonomous subjectivities to human activities involving cooperative, socially instituted work. The Lukacs who stands out in B&amp;la Kiralyfalvi's The Aesthetics of Gy6rgy Lukacs [Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, N.J., 1975. 164 pp. $11.25] is, correctly I think, the Lukacs who consciously struggled to recognize the validity of such notions of traditional aesthetics as the interpenetration of form and content, the self-enclosed 'world' of the artwork, the imaginative departure from resemblance, and so on, without falling into its traditionally idealist theses. Lukacs did so on a number of ways. He saw, of course, as a Marxist, that art springs out of and returns to the needs of social life. Its essential content, therefore, is neither some subjective pleasure nor the merely utilitarian, but the 'ethical-human'; not in the moralistic sense of the good rather than the bad, but in the encompassing sense of the human dynamics of purpose and frustration, of good-and-evil, (cp. pp. 45, 105). Through its consciousness of itself as related to, yet not the same as, objective (i.e., socio-historical) reality, art as 'aesthetic reflection' escapes the delusory belief-systems of magic and religion (cp. p. 50). This 'aesthetic reflection'-'the framework and backbone of Lukacs' entire aesthetic system' (p. 54)-which is in effect Lukacs' category of realistic imitation that is neither literal nor rhetorical, involves the imaginative adoption of a perspective, and the selection of typical traits, characters or events, as contrasted to the reporting of statistical averages or common denominators. What finally 'aesthetically reflects' socially wrought objectivities is the total work of art, not elements that must match particular facts. Reflected in this way is not some universal human condition but the changing conditions in which lived Sophocles, Moliere, Balzac and other great artists (cp. p. 84). Art is thus both anthropomorphic and anthropocen- tric: mankind's needs and accomplishments through history are the essential content, and content, in this sense, necessarily leads to form, though the two in- terpenetrate in the best works (cp. pp. 103-104). The aesthetic reflections are created by use of a language of art that is neither abstractly particular, like the signals of the conditioned reflex, nor abstractly general like common or 320</page><page sequence="2">A Commentary on Kiralyfalvi's Book The Aesthetics of Gyorgy Lukacs scientific discourse but 'specific' or 'special', a synthesis of the particular and the universal through what Lukacs termed a 'primary-plus signalising system' (p. pp. 72, 88-95). Clearly Lukbcs contributed immensely to our understanding of great works, especially of literature and drama, by means of his rare critical gift for uncovering and characterizing what is at once social and realistic in the artistic quality of major works. His was a genuinely Marxist sensibility of art. One might speak here, in an entirely positive and admiring sense of the word, of a consistently 'Marxist bias' in his descriptions and critical evaluations. Much less clear is how well Lukacs was able to meet the really challenging problem of a Marxist theory of art, which cannot simply be an aesthetics, or merely juxtaposed with aesthetics. This is not to imply that any other author has succeeded any better to date. The difficulty is that the concepts familiar to us from the tradition of aesthetic theory seem to appear at appointed places, dressed for their logical roles, without having been properly introduced by the key Marxist principles that underlie Lukacs' thought, e.g., his philosophic realism, his historical sense of dialectical change, the work process that generates social relations and human sociotypes, and so on. The outcome is a somewhat 'materialised' and 'socialised' modification of enlightenment aesthetics, with some ingenious retrievals from Aristotle. Kiralyfalvi echoes Lukacs' thought that 'many people, including communists, are astonished to find that Marxist art theory is deeply rooted in classical traditions' (p. 55). Nothing, in fact should be less surprising, since Marxism is nothing if not closely attentive and responsive to the past. (The subtitle of Capital is, most significantly, 'Critique of Political Economy'.) The danger is not in this rootedness but in merely refurbishing the past in Marxist language, rather than thoroughly criticising and thereby transforming it, as Marx did. One would then no more need to speak of the 'aesthetics' of Gy6rgy Lukacs than one speaks of the 'political economy' of Karl Marx. Kiralyfalvi's exposition is straightforward. In its brief compass, it does not attempt to do much more than recount the development of Lukacs' ideas on art. The style, unfortunately, is often flat, even dissertional. Since the scheme of the book is developmental, each of the footnote references to Lukacs' writings (well located at the bottom of the page rather than later) ought to have carried the relevant data as an aid to the reader. For the same reason, the bibliography, which is subdivided according to language and then alphabetically, ought to have been arranged in chronological order, regardless of language and with an English translation adjoined to each title. The most exploratory chapter is the penultimate one, in which the author discusses what appears to be his own major interest, the relevance of Lukacs' thought to drama. 321</page></plain_text>
