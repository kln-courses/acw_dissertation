<plain_text><page sequence="1">exhibition preview B A M A N A The Art of Existence in Mali JEAN-PAUL COLLEYN * LAURIE ANN FARRELL The Museum for African Art, New York, and the Museum Rietberg, Zurich, have mounted related but separate exhibitions on the Bamana peoples of Mali. The Museum for African Art's "Bamana: The Art of Existence in Mali" (September 13, 2001-May 19, 2002) is curated by Jean-Paul Colleyn and Catherine De Clippel. Frank Herreman, Deputy Directorfor Exhibitions and Publications, Museum for African Art, selected approximately 120 artworks from public and private sources in the United States and Belgium; the exhibition also includes 26 black-and-white photographs taken in thefield by Catherine De Clippel, a photographer and producer and director of documentary films, and 4 video segments. At this writing, the Milwaukee Art Museum is scheduled to host the exhibition in spring 2003, and other venues are under consideration. The selection for the Museum Rietberg presentation, "Bamana: Afrikanische Kunst aus Mali (September 9-December 9, 2001), was made by Lorenz Homberger, Deputy Director and Curator of Exhibitions, Museum Rietberg, who drewfrom works in European collections and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The two museums have collaborated on an exhibition catalogue, co-published by Snoeck-Ducaju &amp; Zoon, Ghent. Edited by Jean-Paul Colleyn, it includes contributions by Mary Jo Arnoldi, Rene A. Bravmann, James T. Brink, David C. Conrad, Catherine De Clippel, Kate Ezra, Barbara E. Frank, Salia Male, and Patrick McNaughton, as well as Colleyn himself. Bamana: The Art of Existence in Mali (256 pp., 230 color photos, 50 b/w field photos; $45 softcover, $75 hardcover) is also available in German (Bamana: Afrikanische Kunst aus Mali; 48 SF softcover, 90 SF hardcover); a French edition isforthcoming. Each edition includes photographs of works from the two exhibitions. This preview is based in part on the catalogue text. Illustrations have been selectedfrom both the New York and Zurich exhibitions. BAMANA IDENTITY _T~ he issue of ethnic identity is complex, but it can be scrutinized by pos- ing a simple question: "Who is classifying whom?" When French col- onizers interrogated their Fula, Arab, and Berber informants about the people living in the central Western Sudan, they were told that they were "Bambara."' This name was widely adopted after the French conquest in 1898, yet it was never used by the people in question as a term of self-reference. The local name was "Bamana," and it has had shifting meanings. From precolonial times to the 1960s, the Bamana were distinguished from other Mande peoples such as the Soninke and Mandinka by their resistance to Islam. French colonial ethnography linked the name "Bambara" and the peoples of the Segou kingdom, who incuded Bamana, because of their opposition to the Fula Islamic state of Massina (1818-62) and to the holy war waged by al Hajj Umar Tal between 1852 and 1862. For these historical reasons, Segou developed a distinctive cultural and political consciousness that has to a certain extent continued to the present day.

The connection can be seen in mosques and in Bamana monuments such as ancestral gates and sanctuaries. condition of being Bamana-refers not to a particular people but to certain religious rep- resentations and practices, to a way of explaining the world and acting on it through rit- uals in order to achieve a state of well-being. Bamana believe that elements of ordinary life-the shape of a cloud, the song of a bird-are signs that must be interpreted. Diviners and priests prescribe ritual actions and sculptures, for use in public or in pri- vate, to deal with the problems of everyday existence by eliminating negative conditions or forces, improving one's luck, or appeasing powerful deities. In rural Mali, the people who claimed (and still do) to be Bamana refer only to the fact that they do not perform the prayers to Allah but remain faithful to the religion of their ancestors. Generally speaking, then, people who belong to initiation societies (jow, sing. jo; the plural may be indicated by a terminal w), who sacrifice animals upon "power objects," or boliw (Fig. 1),2 and who communicate with ancestors through masked or possessed dancers may be called Bamana. It is this simplified meaning of Bamana that the Museum for African Art and the Museum Rietberg have chosen to adopt for their exhibitions and accompanying catalogues. We are aware, however, that the larger reality is far more complex, and that being Bamana is often a process of self-identification. For example, practicing Muslims in and winter 2001 ? african arts 19</page><page sequence="5">7. Vessel. Koulikoro region. Ceramic, glaze; diam- eter 50.8cm (20'). Simmons Collection (MAA). As Barbara Frank notes in her essay for the exhi- bition catalogue (2001:50), Bamana potters have a clear conception of what makes a good pot: most important, a high-pitched ring when one raps one's knuckles against the side of the vessel indicates that the pot has been properly shaped and fired. Potters devote the greatest attention to the surface design of water jars and vessels, as these are intended for public dis- play and are an essential purchase for a young woman's trousseau. In older examples, like this one, molded images with anthropomorphic fig- ures, serpents, or lizards make their way around the body or are splayed across the shoulders. 20 around Segou may identify strongly as Bamana. For them, Bamanaya is located not just in the initiation societies and associated objects but more broadly in language, elements of secular culture, ways of looking at life, and shared lineages and community histories. Indeed, the fact that Bamanaya can be generally seen as a marker opposed to Islam does not mean that it has not been deeply influenced by it. Trimingham (1962) compares the process of conversion from the local religion to Islam to the embellishment of a textile with embroidery. Although Bamanaya-a religious system based on initiation societies- is what remains non-Muslim, it cannot be considered, in the form to which scholars have access, as a pure pre-Islamic religion. Indeed, in many places Bamana have mixed with Islamized populations (Bazin 1985:104; Tauxier 1942:33-35, 54-57; Raffenel 1856, vol. 1:363-65; Imperato 1977:48-52). Two contributions to the exhibition catalogue, by David C. Conrad and Rene A. Bravmann, establish the basis of the Islamic presence and its his- torical importance in shaping Bamana culture. Conrad traces the spread of Islam in what is now Mali and shows how the very principles of acquiring secret knowledge, notably the magic recipes (daliluw), are associated with the idea of pilgrimage to a sacred site. Many boliw are claimed to have been brought from Mecca by a famous hero called Fajigi, a claim which appears to be based on Mansa Musa's pilgrimage in 1324. This legend expresses the accommodation between indigenous religious practices and Islam. Bamanaya also goes far beyond the relatively arbitrary boundaries of ethnic identi- ty. Symbolic representations and art forms of the Bamana initiation societies are found among the Soninke (including the Marka), the Mandinka, the Bozo, and other neigh- boring peoples. The New York and Zurich exhibitions cover a large area of Mali where jow are encountered and where a common language, Mandinka-Bamana, is spoken- although in different dialectical forms or as a second language (among the Minianka and Senufo3). atrlcan arts ? winter 2001</page><page sequence="6">Top: 8.

The Ngon (male monkey) mask comes forth on many occasions to introduce humor and satire, elements that have a key place in Bamana cul- ture. The appearances of the Ci-wara society's antelope masks, the puppets, and the Kor6 soci- ety's Sula masks are preceded by the eccentric- ities and obscenities of Ngon, which mocks everyone and makes sexual gestures. The mask walks through the village and enters family com- pounds, where it playfully steals objects or food. 21</page><page sequence="7">Clockwise from top: 10. Duga, the Vulture, in performance. Kirango, 1980. Photo: Catherine De Clippel. The character of the Vulture makes an explicit link to hunting and to the hunter as hero. The name Duga is itself a praise name for a master hunter. The song for Duga reads: Vulture, Old King, where are you going He says I am wandering I am wandering in search of good fortune You find only good fortune You land on something, but nothing lands on you. The song's opening line includes the praise name Old King, and its final line incorporates a hunter's proverb that speaks of the vulture's invincibility (Arnoldi 2001:80). 11.

This mask walks through the village and enters family compounds to announce a ritual or a pup- pet masquerade. The early ethnography on this part of Africa is French, based on the work of Marcel Griaule (1898-1956) and his followers, who saw in a codified mythology the foun- dation chart for Sudanese cultures (Dieterlen 1957; Zahan 1974). Later, Claude Meillassoux, Jean-Loup Amselle, and Jean Bazin called into question many of the early categories of mythology and cosmology and pointed the way toward a more prag- matic anthropology. Since the early seventies the Mande-Bamana world has been stud- ied by American scholars, often trained in disciplines in addition to or other than anthropology, such as linguistics (Charles Bird), Islamic studies (Nehemia Levtzion), history Uohn 0. Hunwick, David C. Conrad), and art history Uames T. Brink, Rene A. Bravmann, Kate Ezra, Patrick McNaughton, Mary Jo Arnoldi, Sarah Brett-Smith). These scholars have enriched anthropological research by paying close attention to the contextualization of oral texts and recognizing a more flexible cosmology than that described by the French school of ethnography. Several of them have contributed to alrican arts * winter 2001 24</page><page sequence="10">the exhibition catalogue, to which anthropologist and Bamana initiate Salia Male brings his specific expertise. THE EXHIBITION The New York and Zurich exhibitions are conceptually the same, following the organi- zation of the catalogue. With the videos, Catherine De Clippel's photographs, taken in Mali over the last twenty years or so, provide a context for the art objects and convey the vitality of the culture. Visitors walk through sections on social and religious aspects of Bamana culture. The journey progresses from the public arena to the most sacred and secret levels, from the clear to the obscure. Public Life When entering a Bamana village, one is immediately confronted with an array of striking visual images seen in architecture, sculpture, and applied arts. Both exhibitions begin with photographs of the architecture, including houses and community structures (Figs. 4-6), and examples of household arts, among them doors with figural locks, stools, hed- die pulleys, and ceramics (Fig. 7). These are open to public view. This section also includes various representations of leadership through photographs of secular and religious offi- cials along with symbols of authority, such as hunters' jackets and staffs (Figs. 2, 3). Masks and Puppets of the Village Association The village association (ton) comprises female and male divisions and is organized according to age groups (flan-bolow). One enters the ton after circumcision and leaves it at 25</page><page sequence="11">MAGGIE NIMKIN 26</page><page sequence="12">the age of about thirty-five. Every year the ton organizes a festival of theatrical perfor- mances in the village square. These include koteba and the puppets known as sogo bb in a succession of light-hearted sketches that satirize aspects of Bamana social and religious life. Prior to the public performances, ton members parade through the village streets accompanying masks (sogow) such as Ngon and Ntomo (Figs. 8, 9). Sogobaw (big beasts) resemble small, mobile theaters with a head and a wood-frame body (e.g., Fig. 10). Small puppets, expertly manipulated, emerge from the back of this "beast" (Figs. 11, 12). The exhibition presents Ngon (monkey) masks, a selection of puppets, and pho- tographs of performances. The visitor may also watch a puppet performance on large- screen video monitors. The footage includes the audience's reactions and interactions during the entertainment. The Sacred and the Secret Bamana jow have a tremendous importance in social and religious life. The exhibitions in both New York and Zurich explore the role of these initiation societies (some winter 2001 atrlcan arts Opposite page, counterclockwise from top left: 18.

Dr. Marshall and Caroline Mount (MAA). authors have called them brotherhoods) through a wide range of objects used in their rituals, including wooden masks, iron staffs, and power altars. In jow like Kbm, Kbnb, Nama, and Ci-wara, among others, one gains access to secret knowledge by traveling and working for a reputed master (soma). Some villages may not have even a single jo, while in many others several societies may coexist and compete with one another. Although jow are considered men's organizations,4 in numerous cases women may make offerings to and even seek help from one of the jo deities. Furthermore, each jo has one female official who may perform important ritual functions, though she is not supposed to know the society's secrets. Bamana rely on their jow for social interaction and as a means to address such problems as sickness, misfortune, and mystical aggres- sion. While these societies are influential in political and judicial matters, today most of their power is overshadowed by state institutions and Islam. The Jo Society The Jo (a specific society, not to be confused with the generic name for these organizations) has become a sort of framework for other initiation societies, like Ci-wara, Namakoro, and Nya. Until a few decades ago, initiation was obligatory for every young male.5 As with the Kore, Jo initiations take place every seven years, after candidates receive six years of special training. During this time, the young men go through a ritual death and live one week in the bush before returning to the village. There they publicly perform the dances and songs they have learned in the bush, and receive small presents from spectators. After a ritual bath that signals the end of their animal life, the new initiates become "Jo children." Among the sculptures in the exhibitions are those called Jomooni (small person of the Jo) and Jonyeleni (small, beautiful young lady of the Jo). Representing beautiful young women, they often display decorative motifs on the face and body that were fashionable as scarifications before 1930 (Figs. 13, 14), and some are dressed and deco- african arts ? winter 2001 28</page><page sequence="14">rated with jewelry. Numerous washings and applications of oil have imparted a lus- trous black color to some of these sculptures. This section also exhibits crest masks and musical instruments used during Jo rituals. The Ntomo and Kore Societies Ntomo and Kore societies exist throughout the Niger Valley.6 Initially Ntomo, which leads to Kore, was a society for uncircumcised boys. Today it closely resembles various Western associations in its bureaucratic structure and its administrative and member- ship fees. The exhibitions feature Ntomo masks whose thin mouths underscore the virtue of silence and the importance of controlling one's speech (Figs. 15, 16, 17). In general, during their time in Ntomo the boys lear to accept discipline. They do not yet have access to the secret knowledge related to Kore and other initiation societies. Bamana people perceive Kore as the "father of the rain and thunder." Every seven years a new age-set of teenagers experiences a symbolic death and rebirth into the Kore society through initiation rituals whose symbols relate to fire and masculinity. JERRY L. THOMPSON winter 2001 ? atrican arts 29</page><page sequence="15">Initiations take place in the sacred wood, where the youths are harassed by elders and the clown-like performers called koredugaw.7 Until the 1940s, initiates practiced a form of ritual dueling with whips. Today, how- ever, the rituals are less severe. Furthermore, while many original types of Kore masks have been phased out and distinctions between ritual groups made less evident, initi- ates traditionally belonged to a several different groups, each having its own masks (Figs. 18, 19). In their general form and detail, a group of Kore masks in the two exhi- bitions conveys concepts such as knowledge, courage, and energy through the repre- sentation of hyenas, lions, and other animals. The Kbmb and Kbnb Societies This page: Left: 25. The "wearer of fibers" dresses for the Ci-wara dance. Dyele, 1987. Photo: Catherine De Clippel. Right: 26. Crest mask: Ci-wara.

Crest mask: Ci-wara. S6gou region. Wood; 81cm (31.9"). Dr. B. Kofler, Riehen (MRZ). The model for the male mask is the roan ante- lope (hippotragus). Vertical forms of this mask are encountered in eastern Bamana country. 30 Komo and Kbno are other secret societies that can be found in Bamana regions. These jow form political networks that transcend the limits of the village. Their masks and boliw are said to symbolize an association, or marriage, with the supernatural entity.8 In contrast to Kbmo masks, which are covered with feathers, horns, and teeth (Figs. 21, 22), those of the Kbno society are elegant and simple (Figs. 23, 24). Komo sanctuaries have spread throughout present-day Mali as well as Guinea, southern Mauritania, eastern Senegal, western Burkina Faso, and northern C6te d'Ivoire. Their style strongly reflects the influence of Arab mosques, palaces, and other types of Sudanese architecture. Traditionally led by blacksmiths, each sanctuary once exerted significant political influence, using the voice of a masked dancer to commu- nicate messages to villagers. Again, Kbno and Kbmo masks and boliw figures on view in both exhibitions are contextualized by video footage and photographs. The Ci-wara Society Ci-wara is a society related to agricultural fertility. Its performance, which incorporates the characteristic antelope headcrests and other sculpture, is based on the Bamana respect for the union of male and female. Just as human reproduction is the result of the sexual union between man and woman, so agricultural fertility is attributed to the union between the sun, an expression of the male principle, and earth and water, an alrican arts ? winter 2001</page><page sequence="16">R. WOLFSBERGER expression of the female principle (Brink 1981:25). Through farming, the man manip- ulates the sun and brings "him" to inseminate the earth. According to Dominique Zahan, "This union is the model for the association between the man and wife and for their reproduction" (1960:34). A large ensemble of Ci-wara figures in the exhibitions, presented with video footage and field photographs, illustrates the creative range of their Bamana makers in representing antelopes, anteaters, chameleons, pangolins, and hybrid zoomorphic creatures (Figs. 25, 26, 27). We hope that the exhibitions at the Museum for African Art and the Museum Rietberg, and the accompanying publication, will offer insight into the practices and representations used by the Bamana to face the problems of daily life. The exhibition catalogue brings together the research of African, American, and European scholars, and while modest in light of the range and complexity of the subject, it nonetheless permits us to measure the distance we have come since the pioneering work of Robert Goldwater (1960) in his land- mark exhibition and catalogue for the Museum of Primitive Art.

Her research into Marshall's iconography and materials and her analysis of his political and social engagement are carefully balanced with references to his sophisticated formal language. The traditional chronological presentation is well justified by the historical content of the narratives and the sense of stylistic progression. Fragments of the conversation between Jaffa and Marshall are interspersed throughout the color plates and presented in thematic sequences. Their candid exchange about impor- tant themes in Marshall's work-the legacy of the Civil Rights movements, social and racial violence, the use of metaphors and allegories in the paintings-is an interesting counterpart to Terrie Sultan's essay. It clarifies Marshall's phi- losophy about art as product, process, and phi- losophy and further explores the references to American history. Past events are never evoked with nostalgia, but reveal the tension with the present, a dynamic integral to the paintings. History is posited as a shifting paradigm, a per- spective that allows the artist to constantly revise his own approach to art making. The his- tory of art, for example, is seen as a collection of ideas and concepts from which one is free to borrow and which can be transformed. Marshall's "Notes on Career and Work" mixes biographical information with analytical statements, and reviews some of his most important series of works: The Garden Project, Mementos, The Lost Boys. Recollections of the artist's early childhood highlight his extraordi- nary focus and dedication during his formative years. Marshall also talks about Charles White and the older artist's impact in terms of Marshall's artistic choices, his classical train- ing, and his emphasis on content-based work. Particularly interesting is Marshall's ac- count of how he came to create his archetypal image of a black person, a highly stylized image that recurs in works from different periods but appeared first in a 1980 self-por- trait, A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self. Its sources are Ellison's Invisible Man, vaudevillian black-faced characters, and a 1961 horror film, Mr. Sardonicus, from which the artist borrowed the large toothy grin. In regard to recent polemics about the reclama- tion and use of stereotypical images of African Americans, particularly in the work of the artists Kara Walker and Michael Ray Charles, Marshall here demonstrates the process of multiple encoding inherent in identity and thus warns us implicitly against any form of essentialism. As Kerry James Marshall claims his place in the history of art, he embraces both visual and narrative complexity and deft craftsman- ship as keys to uncovering truths about the human experience. The book allows the read- er to participate in his search and offers a vision of lastingness and perseverance. Besides being attractive to those who share the artist's passion for art making and sensual intellectu- alism, Kerry James Marshall is valuable to readers who are engaged in understanding historical constructs and who search for a sense of proportion-and beauty-in the midst of their chaos. O notes COLLEYN &amp; FARRELL: Notes, from page 31 1. The term "Bambara" is also the French name for a local dialect of Mandinka, the language of the people from "Mande," which was widespread in the Empire of Mali between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. Since Mali's independence, Bamana (bdmana kdn) has become the nation's vernacular language. 2. McNaughton (1979a) and Bazin (1985) use this expression to designate these objects which embody the powers of deities. 3. The Minianka, too, had their name imposed by the French administration, but they call themselves Bamana. In Mali, Senufo who are not Muslim and are affiliated with the jow rather than the Poro religious complex consider themselves Bamana. 4. Because of their capacty to give birth, women are suspected of having secret knowledge, and thus are feared. According to Bamana legends and myth, women originally owned all boliw, but they were unable to maintain and control them. A principal func- tion of male initiation societies is to protect members against witchcraft, an area where women are thought to excel. When one speaks of an individual who has betrayed the secrecy of the cult, one says that "he has given himself (as prey) to the women." Allusions are made to female initiation societies, the most famous being the Gwan or Nyagwan (hot eye) that existed within the Jo. 5. In some parts of the Bamana area, the Ntomo and the Kore do not exist. They have been replaced by the Jo society, a glob- al structure that incorporates other jow such as Ci-wara and Namakoro but excludes the Komo. Between 1950 and 1970, the Jo society was located in a large area bounded on the east by the Bagoe River, on the south by the city of Odienne in Ivory Coast, on the north by the town of Dioila, and on the west by the Baould River. Today a strong concentration of villages still practices Jo initiation in the Baninko region south of Dioila. 6. Identifying the institutions that compose the jow is not a straightforward process. Much of the literature excludes Ntomo and Kore, apparently because they do not sacrifice to a boliw (Arnoldi 1995:192; McNaughton 1979a:5). 7. The koredugaw form a special class by themselves. They often belong to groups distinct from the Kore. These ritual buffoons participate in public events and imitate hunters and warriors with pretend guns and wooden horses. As powerful people, the latter are expected to tolerate the mockery. 8. Boliw, with their strange forms, attracted the attention of Western modem artists in the 1930s; a photo of a boli was included in the important avant-garde journal Minotaure. The aesthetic value of these objects, currently so fascinating to artists, psychologists and anthropologists, has long been denied. Boliw have rarely been exhibited, as their ritual power is deemed too secret to allow their public display. References cited Amoldi, Mary Jo. 2001.

RUSH: Notes, from page 47 This article was acceptedfor publication in March 2001. The data presented here is based on predissertation research conducted in Benin in 1993, supported by the Social Science Research Council; and on dissertation research conducted in Benin from 1994-1996, supported by Fulbright IIE and various University of Iowa fellowships, with special support from PASALA (Project for the Advanced Study of Art and Life in Africa). Some follow-up work was carried out from December 1998 to March 1999, supported by a J. Paul Getty Postdoctoral Fellowship. Thanks to Prita Meier, Allen F. Roberts, Mary Nooter Roberts, and the African Arts reviewers for thoughtful comments. Special thanks to Eileen Moyer, Alissa Rossman, and Jay Sosa for ongoing support and encouragement. 1. This idea of an ever-changing aesthetic system was pursued in an ACASA-sponsored panel I chaired for the 89th Annual College Art Association: "The 'Unfinished Aesthetic' in African and African Diaspora Arts," held in Chicago, March 2, 2001. 2. The festival was supposed to have been held at the end of 1992 but was postponed. Because all of the publicity and other mate- rials had already been printed with "Ouidah 92," the name stuck. 3. In 1991 Soglo became president of the first freely elected demo- cratic government in more than twenty years. He succeeded Mathieu Kerekou, who, during his presidency (1974-1991) of what was then called the People's Republic of Benin, had unsuc- cessfully attempted to restructure the government, economy, and society along Marxist-Leninist lines. Kerekou defeated Soglo in the 1996 election. 4. See Herskovits (1938) for the important role of the Abomey kings in precolonial artistic patronage. 5. 1 was denied permission to photograph this mask. The image is known to have been mass-produced on a calendar (ten to twenty years ago), but I have not yet located a copy. 6. The cosest English translation of the Fon word aze is "witch- craft." An azeton, "the one with aze," or a "witch," is a person who can change into a bird (usually an owl) during his or her sleep and cause great harm to others. To say that "someone has a bird" is to call that person an azeton. Thus the human figure with angel's wings on the Gelede mask is regarded as a person in the process of transforming from a bird into a human, or vice-versa. 7. The Beninese artists discussed in this article have participat- ed in intemational exhibitions which are highlighted in a vol- ume of Revue Noire: Contemporary African Art (1995) dedicated solely to Beninese artists. They are also included in the book Contemporary Art of Africa (Magnin 1996). 8. Recycling is not a new idea in Africa. See Roberts 1992; Cemy &amp; Seriff 1996. 9. The Dakpogan brothers and Biokou were initially impressed, however, by the recycled artworks of Romuald Hazoume, who has come to be known in the international market. Hazoume is best known for his masques bidon, which he makes out of plastic jugs and other recycled objects (see Magnin 1996:132-33). 10. There are also striking similarities between this rendering of Legba and an Exu shrine in Salvador, Brazil, illustrated in Galembo (1993:134); that Exu image is also homed and phallic. 11. "Fa" (from the Yoruba "Ifa") expresses at least two different ideas in Fon. Its literal meaning, "coolness," in turn conveys ideas of mildness, softness, gentleness, or peacefulness and equi- librium. Du comes from the Yoruba odu, the innumerable verses associated with the 256 possible combinations resulting from throwing 16 cowries or an 8-seeded divination chain. 12. It is worth noting that Robert Farris Thompson illustrates a cement "Eshu Boi" with cowries inserted into his chest. This figure, in the Museu de Policia in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was probably made before 1941. Thompson notes that in "Dahomean Yorubaland there are freestanding images for Elegba with mystic signs of the divina- tion deity marked in inserted cowries on the chest of the image," which he compares to the cement Rio Elegba (1983:26, pl. 13). 13. "Syncretism" is a term used commonly in Benin. As a prac- tice, it is generally frowned upon and resolutely denied by most devout Catholics and Muslims. Vodun practitioners, however, are very open to syncretism, and daim that Beninese Catholics and Muslims blend their foreign faiths with Vodun. For example, Catholics claim that the veneration of dead twins (hohovi) is not Vodun worship, and they often maintain twin shrines in their homes. Vodun Priest Joseph Guendehou receives guests from all over west Africa and from overseas to attend his "Vodun Mass" every Sunday in Cotonou. 14. There are stories of people who had cakati so badly that they could not be cured through traditional methods. In one case in particular, it is caimed that a man went to a Western hospital, and the surgeon found broken glass, razor blades, and nails inside his afrlcan arts ? winter 2001</page></plain_text>
