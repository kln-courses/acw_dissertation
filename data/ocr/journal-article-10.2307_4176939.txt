(? 2005 Cambridge University Press doi:Io.IoI7/Soo22226705003282 Printed in the United Kingdom The zoom-on-possessee construction in Kam (Dong): the anatomy of a new construction type1 MATTHIAS GERNER Johannes Gutenberg Universitdt, Mainz (Received 6 December 2003; revised 6 December 2004) Kam, a Kadai language spoken in Guizhou province (People's Republic of China), has a family of intransitive possessive constructions with the word order 'Possessor-Verb- Possessee'. (The basic word order in Kam is SV and AVO.) While two recent papers have featured this unique construction type for an array of other Southeast Asian languages, they fail to acknowledge its distinct semantic value in contrast to the related construction type 'Possessee-Possessor-Verb'. The former construction type displays a so-called 'zoom-effect': the possessor is predicated IN, AT or THROUGH his/her/its possessee; the predication zooms from the possessor on his/her/its possessee. The latter construction, in contrast, views the possessee as an entity separated from its possessor, and the predicate as applying solely to the possessee. After illustrating the 'zoom- effect' for a representative sample of Kam constructions, I demonstrate that 'zoom- effects' do not merely exist when the possessee-possessor compound has the zero-role (= intransitive subject) as above, but also when it assumes other semantic roles (e.g. patient, force, etc.). A general definition of this construction type, called 'zoom- on-possessee construction', is proposed; it enables us to unify and account for an array of hitherto disparate construction types that run in the literature under labels such as 'proprioceptive state expressions', 'body part locative constructions', 'dative of affect', etc. Furthermore, I discuss in some detail whether zoom-on-possessee con- structions are better accounted for within a multi-stratal or a mono-stratal framework and, finally, whether the concept of noun-incorporation has any relevance. [i] I wish to warmly thank Wu Shihua, a native Kam from Sanjiang county, who spent con- siderable time with me in Kunming (P. R. of China) in 2002-2003 to discuss the empirical basis of this and other works. Special gratitude also goes to Noel Johnston for comments on an earlier version of this paper. I am also grateful to two anonymous JL referees for their constructive criticism leading to a greatly improved version of the paper.

INTRODUCTION The very numerous studies on the notion of possession and the grammatical expression of possessive noun phrases have evolved in two directions. First, various scholars have looked at the structural strategies by which languages encode the conceptual difference between inalienable possession and alien- able possession. Second, another category of papers has been preoccupied with the study of diverse possessive construction types. A possessive con- struction in its most general outlet can be defined as a (simple or complex) clause integrating two nouns that, in addition to their potential participant role, stay in a mutual possessor-possessee relationship. The current paper is a contribution to the second line of research. Kam (Dong)2 exhibits a host of intransitive stative and dynamic predications taking the structure Npor-V-Npee, where Npor and NPee are two nouns with an independent possessor-possessee relationship. These predications treat Npor and Npee syntactically in the same way that a monotransitive3 action encodes its agent and patient: AVO (see footnote 5 for a definition of the semantic macro-roles A and 0). The main claim of this paper is that the Npor-V-Npee predications are special cases of a quite general construction type that I term ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION. The characterization offered in this paper is sufficiently abstract to unify and account for a variety of hitherto disparate construction types that run in the literature under the labels of 'proprioceptive state expressions', 'body part locative construc- tion', 'dative of affect', and so forth. The presentation proceeds as follows. In section 2, I introduce the terminology we need to speak about the phenomena under examination precisely. In section 3, a corpus of zoom-on-possessee constructions (hence- forth, ZoP-constructions) in Kam is established by paying special attention to those that display a metaphorical relationship between the possessive noun phrases and the verb. In section 4, a number of more theoretical issues concerning ZoP-constructions are discussed (their formal definition, a dis- cussion of the proposal to analyse ZoP-constructions as cases of possessor ascension, active zone profile or noun-incorporation, and an explanation [2] Kam (autonym), or Dong (Han-Chinese appellation), belongs genetically to the Kam-Sui language group, which is part of the Kam-Tai branch belonging to the Kadai language family. Kadai, alongside the Miao-Yao language family, is one of the components of the Austro-Tai language phylum (cf. Benedict 1975; Edmondson &amp; Solnit I988, I997). There is an ongoing controversy as to whether Kadai and Miao-Yao languages should be joined with the Austronesian language family into an Austro-Tai phylum. The Austronesian-Tai connection was pioneered by Benedict (1942, 1975) and this link is accepted by a number of historical linguists working on Kadai and Miao-Yao. However, Austronesian linguists remain skeptical about the reconstructions made and have characterized them as 'too loose' (Ross 1994: 96). [3] In this paper, I take the terms 'intransitive', 'monotransitive' and 'ditransitive' as equivalent to 'one-place', 'two-place' and 'three-place'. 308</page><page sequence="3">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) of their metaphorical productivity). Not every intransitive verb may be involved in ZoP-constructions of the kind examined in section 3. The ability to appear as the predicate of ZoP-constructions is a property attached to the lexical entry of the verb. We have tried to do justice to this fact in the forthcoming dictionary (cf. Gerner et al. forthcoming) by treating each complex V-Npee as an independent dictionary entry. In the appendix to this paper, I offer a representative inventory of ZoP-expressions, notably the metaphorical ones. 2. TERMINOLOGY In section 2.1, I will acknowledge a number of typical possessor-possessee relations on a two-dimensional cognitive map, which is structured by two axes: the 'conceptual-distance' coordinate axis and the 'durability' coordi- nate axis. In section 2.2, I sketch a working definition of the notion of ZoP- construction and embark on a quick tour of the relevant literature (a full definition of ZoP-constructions follows in section 4.1). 2.1 The in/alienability parameter and the notion of possession role The aim of this section is to capture the principal features of possessor-possessee pairs. Although the concept of in/alienability has no significance for the grammar of Kam (as I will demonstrate shortly), I found the concept helpful for the organization of the rather amorphous possessor- possessee pairs. The raison d'etre for this subsection is thus to support the empirical part of this paper (especially the appendix) by providing a prin- cipled naming system for the possession pairs. Scholars tend to sketch the notion of in/alienation as a prototypical category clustering around the following four features (Velazquez-Castillo I996: 39): (i) CONCEPTUAL DISTANCE between possessor and possessee: it is smaller for inalienable possession types and greater for alienable possession types (Haiman I985: 130; Croft I990: 174-176; Chappell &amp; McGregor I996a: 4f.) (ii) INHERENCY of relationship between the possessor and possessee: it is essentially relational for inalienable possession types and non- relational or established for alienable possession types (Fillmore I968: 6i; Hyman et al. 1970: 85; Kliffer i983: 759; Seiler I983a: 5, I983b: 93; Nichols I988: 568) (iii) INSEPARABILITY of relationship between the possessor and the possessee: it is inseparable for inalienable possession types and separable for alienable possession types (Chappell &amp; McGregor I989: 25; Velazquez- Castillo i996: 36f.) (iV) DURABILITY (or 'permanency') of relationship between the possessor and the possessee: it is permanent for inalienable possession types and tem- porary for alienable possession types (Velazquez-Castillo I996: 36f). 309</page><page sequence="4">MATTHIAS GERNER Two of the above four gradable features may serve as the coordinate axes of a cognitive two-dimensional map: the features of conceptual distance (small+-+great) and of durability (permanent+-4temporary).' Similar to the well-known participant roles of verbal predicates (e.g. agent, patient),5 possessive noun phrases also exhibit a number of what I call possessive roles. These diverse possessive roles may be subsumed under the two (abstract) macro-roles of POSSESSOR and POSSESSEE. In (i), I locate a representative number of possessor-possessee pairs with regard to the two features singled out above (compare the labels in this diagram with those in Langacker iggia: I69; Riegel I984; Taylor I989). ( I ) LINK permanent DURABILITY temporary person-body part owner-belongings person-body substance small animal-body part animal-body substance plant-plant part plant-fruit/plant-leaves object-part mass-constituent CONCEPTUAL person-kin person-social contact DISTANCE family-member social group-member set of objects-object container-contents collection-collection of parts (e.g. people-their legs) great entity-attribute entity-state agent-action/patient-action thinker-idea [4] Tsunoda (I996: 576) proposes a possession cline, i.e. a one-dimensional understanding of the organization of possession types: body part &gt; inherent attribute &gt; clothing &gt; kin &gt; pet animal &gt; product &gt; other possessee. The relevance of this cline is justified with data from Japanese honorific expressions. Native speakers tend to accept the higher-placed items of this cline in honorific expressions, while those placed at a lower position are rejected as odd. [5] In this paper I will use the following labels to denote semantic participant roles of a verbal predicate (see Dik (1997: II8-122) for the definition of most of the semantic roles presented here): S = tagent (the entity controlling an intransitive action), processed (the entity that under- goes an intransitive process), zero (the entity involved in an intransitive state)}, A= {agent (the entity controlling a transitive action), positioner (the entity controlling a transitive positional state), force (the non-controlling entity instigating a process)}, and 0= {patient (the entity affected by an agent, positioner or force)}. S, A and 0 are the macro-roles used by Dixon (1979, 1994) and I will adopt them in this paper because of their pervasiveness in the typological literature. They neither denote semantic roles (agent, patient, etc.) nor are they equivalent to the syntactic (i.e. gram- matical) relations of subject and object. Rather, they represent some intermediate notion between semantic role and syntactic relation. They are universal in the sense that every language has them - just as semantic roles are universal - but they stand in contrast to the syntactic relations of subject and object, which are not universal. S, A and 0 are best understood as an EXTENSIONAL lumping together of semantic roles. This presentation is in line with Role and Reference Grammar (Van Valin &amp; LaPolla 1997). 310</page><page sequence="5">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) As alluded to in the introduction, languages may choose different morpho- syntactic strategies to encode the difference between inalienable and alien- able possession, for example, through the use of two sets of possessive affixes (found in certain Austronesian languages): one set for inalienable and one set for alienable possessor-possessee pairs. It is correct to say that the con- cept of in/alienability has left almost no footprint in the grammar of Kam. Kam does not involve any marking particle indicating the distribution of possessive roles. Instead, possessive roles are encoded through the word or- der Np,e-Npor, independently of the question of in/alienability. As the ex- amples in section 3 will demonstrate, ZoP-constructions do not exhibit any particular restriction on the type of admissible Npee-Npor pair - with the exception perhaps of the kinship type - thus reducing the relevance of the in/alienability criterion in Kam. In Gerner (2003: 59f.), I show that the passive in Kam does not discriminate between inalienable and alienable possession either, in contrast to other East and Southeast Asian languages (e.g. Mandarin, see Chappell I986 for details). Kam in fact admits a passive of inalienable and a passive of (certain forms of) alienable possession. 2.2 A preliminary definition of ZoP-constructions In the languages of Southeast Asia (including Kadai languages, Miao-Yao languages, Mon-Khmer languages and Vietnamese), it is a well-established fact that stative predications expressing sensations and emotions project the experiencer in a preverbal position and the body part, where the sensation or emotion is felt, in a postverbal position (cf. Matisoff I986 and Clark I996 for a comparative study of the phenomenon in Southeast Asian languages; Huffman 1970 for Khmer; Liem 1970, among many others, for Vietnamese; Clark I989 and Jaisser I990 for White Hmong; and Iwasaki 2002 for Thai): (2) Person - Stative Verb - Body Part (3) SV (the basic word order for intransitive clauses) (4) AVO (the basic word order of monotransitive clauses in these languages). The labels given to the structure in (2) are 'Stative-verb-body-part con- struction' (Clark I996: 535) and 'Proprioceptive-state expression' (Iwasaki 2002). In my opinion, the existing approaches suffer from two shortcomings. First, in Southeast Asian languages the structure in (2) is not restricted to body part nouns (though body parts are the most prominent group), but is also available for other possession types (i.e. possessor-possessee relations). In Kam, for example, there are many impersonal possession types configur- able with structure (2), such as 'sky-ascend-cloud = the sky has clouds rising up' or 'stove-dead-fire =the stove has its fire extinguished' and so forth. Secondly, scholars have not paid enough attention to the semantics of (2) in contrast to that of the structural variant in (5). 3"1</page><page sequence="6">MATTHIAS GERNER (5) Body Part - Person - Stative Verb Let us consider an example from Kam. The lexical components of (6a) and (6b) are the same, but (6a) follows the word order of (2), while (6b) is an exponent of (5).6 (6) (a) mau33 it323 pup323 3P SG ill, ache lung PERSON BODY PART 'He is ill in the lungs (e.g. pneumonia).' (b) pup323 mau33 it323. lung 3P SG POSS ill, ache BODY PART PERSON 'His lungs are ill (e.g. pneumonia).' There is also a clear semantic difference between (6a) and (6b). In the former version, the person appears as the entity that is ill and the lungs are the locus of that ailment. One could paraphrase (6a) as He is ill AT, IN or THROUGH his lungs. In the latter version, (6b), the lungs appear as an entity separate from the rest of the body. The illness is principally a matter of the lungs, not of the person. For this reason, I have found it suitable to call the former structure 'zoom-on-possessee construction' (ZoP-construction), since it zooms from the possessor onto the possessee. (I will define and discuss this construction type in more detail in section 4.) ZoP-constructions thus diverge from constructions such as (6b). The name I adopt for the construction (6b) iS POSSESSEE-POSSESSOR-CONSTRUCTION (Npee-Npor-construction). In addition to these two constructions, we have to acknowledge another variant, re- cognized in the literature as the 'double-nominative construction', 'double- subject construction' or 'double-topic construction'. Consider the following example from Kam: (6) ('c) mau33 pUp323 it323. 3P SG lung ill, ache PERSON BODY PART 'As for him, his lungs are ill (e.g. pneumonia).' Here, the possessor appears as topic in initial position, while the body part and the predicate constitute the clausal comment. Iwasaki (2002: 39) rightly remarks that 'double-subject' and 'double-topic' are inappropriate labels for (6c), since there is exactly one topic and one subject involved. I adopt therefore the neutral label POSSESSOR-POSSESSEE-CONSTRUCTION (NpOr-Np,,- construction). [6] The superscript numbers 5 13, etc. are tone markers and indicate relative pitch on a scale from I (lowest) to 5 (highest). The first number represents the beginning and the second number the end of the tonal contour. 312</page><page sequence="7">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) 3. ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTIONS IN KAM Zoom-on-possessee constructions in Kam have the structure Npor-V-Np,e and communicate the meaning that the possessor is evaluated through the possessee or that the possessee is the locus of where the possessor is predi- cated. ZoP-constructions in Kam are mainly simple clauses where neither possessor nor possessee exercise control over the predication. From the point of view of situation type, ZoP-constructions in Kam consist of states and processes, but not of actions or positions (see section 4 for more discussion). Stative ZoP-constructions constitute a particularly productive subtype and it is possible to further divide them into objective states (section 3.I) and subjective states (section 3.2). Process ZoP-constructions are frequent in Kam too, and are examined in section 3.3. Whenever different construction types are contrasted in this section, I will display them in the following order (the main opposition is between (b) and (d) and not between (c) and (d) in spite of similarities in the notation): (a) Possessor-possessee NP (b) ZoP-construction (c) Npo0-Npee-construction (d) Npee-Npor-construction 3.1 Objective or observable states Objective or observable states are states that can be evaluated by a person independent from the entity that is described by it. They correspond roughly to Iwasaki's notion of 'external state' (Iwasaki 2002: 38). Objective states stand in contrast to subjective states which are experienced by the entity depicted by it. As for objective states, we discriminate further between those that involve a metaphorical relationship between the adjective and the possessee and those where this relationship is literal. 3.I.I Literal ZoP-constructions Literal ZoP-constructions express a straightforward relationship between the stative predicate and the post-verbal possessee, i.e. the meaning of their interaction is not derived through a metaphorical process. Most of the possessor-possessee pairs listed in 2.1 admit a predicate that transforms them into ZoP-constructions of this type. With body parts (= possessees), these constructions simply describe observable characteristics of these parts. (7) (a) ta55 mau33 eye 3P SG POSS BODY PART PERSON 'his eye' 313</page><page sequence="8">MATTHIAS GERNER (b) mau33 lat11 ta55. 3P SG protruding eye PERSON BODY PART lit. 'He is protruding at his eyes.' (c) mau33 ta55 lat" 3P SG eye protruding PERSON BODY PART 'As for him, the eyes are protruding.' (d) ta55 mau33 lat". eye 3P SG protruding BODY PART PERSON 'His eyes are protruding.' The ZoP-construction in (7b) conveys literally the meaning 'He is protruding at his eyes' (or in a more colloquial form 'He has protruding eyes'). The inner-sentential focus slides from the possessor to the possessee, which explains the name of this construction, 'Zoom-on-possessee construction'. The possessee-possessor construction (7d) presents the eyes as if they were an entity separated from the rest of the body. Example (8) constitutes a ZoP-construction whose possessee is a human body part, very similar to (7b). The best approximation in English is to translate the body part as a locative depicting the locus where the descriptive state holds. (8) mau33 ,iu13 na323. 3P SG wrinkled face PERSON BODY PART 'He has wrinkles in her/his face.' In Kam it is possible to combine certain pairs of body parts (e.g. 'face' and 'nose', 'foot' and 'hand') and to involve them with a predicate that is reduplicated and intercalated between them, see example (9). This morpho- logical process is very productive in Kam. In the forthcoming dictionary (Gerner et al. forthcoming), I have counted ca. 200 'double-ZoP-construc- tions' involving about io pairs of body parts.7 In the appendix to this paper, I present a representative sample of these 'double-ZoP-constructions'. (9) mau33 pelg33 na323 peU33 nu55. 3P SG swollen face swollen nose PERSON BODY PART BODY PART 'He is swollen everywhere in his face.' [7] Not every pair of body parts may appear in 'double ZoP-constructions', but only those that form the edges of a range of body parts, e.g. 'eye-ear' = 'the sensory organs from sight to hearing (possibly including the sense of smell)', and those where one body part functions as a container of the other, e.g. 'face-nose' = 'the face including all the facial body parts'. 314</page><page sequence="9">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) In the following example, the possessee is not a body part but represents the ideas or thoughts of someone, the possessor, who is the 'thinker' of these ideas. The ZoP-construction in (iob) admits an English translation that renders well the nature of the ZoP-construction: 'be good at having ideas'. (io) (a) Li53 mau33 (b) mau33 lai55 t53. idea 3P SG POSS 3P SG good idea IDEA THINKER THINKER IDEA 'his idea' 'He is good at having ideas.' (c) mau33 Li53 lai55 (d) Li53 mau33 lai55 3P SG idea good idea 3PSG good THINKER IDEA IDEA THINKER 'As for him, his ideas 'His ideas are good.' are good.' Fish in a pond turn their white belly upwards just moments before they die. This fact is captured in Kam by the following ZoP-construction: (II) pa55 pak31 an55. fish white body ANIMAL BODY PART 'The fish is white in its body (i.e. it is about to die).' Plants and plant parts constitute another productive type of possessor- possessee pairs. Example (12) involves the colour green and states that the locus of where the tree is green is its leaves. (12) m;i3l su55 pa53 tree green leaf PLANT PART 'The tree is green in its leaves.' Kam differs from Thai in that for almost every ZoP-construction it is also possible to derive a double-NP-construction with a difference in meaning. In Thai the ZoP-construction seems mainly restricted to what Iwasaki (2002) terms 'proprioceptive states', which portray (human) sensations and emo- tions, whereas the Npor-Npee-construction is attached to what I call in this paper 'objective or observable states'. In Kam, on the other hand, there is no such division of labour ('objective states' encoded as 'Np0,-NPe,- construction', 'proprioceptive states' encoded as 'ZoP-construction'), but a stative predicational frame can be, in principle, realized through both constructions with a difference in meaning. In addition, a predicational frame may also be encoded as a Npee-Npor-construction. Sometimes there are colloquial preferences such as in the following example, where speakers prefer (b) and (c) over (d), although all three versions are acceptable constructions. 3I5</page><page sequence="10">MATTHIAS GERNER (I3) (a) ain11(ti323) kor323 year, age grandfather ATTRIBUTE ENTITY 'grandfather's age' (b) koj323 mak323 a,in1 lieu31. grandfather big year, age DP ENTITY ATTRIBUTE 'Grandfather is advanced in age.'

(d) ain11(ti323) korj323 mak323 lieu31. year, age grandfather big DP ATTRIBUTE ENTITY 'Grandfather's age is advanced.' In the next example, the possessor-possessee relationship is between a container and its contents. All the construction types (b), (c) and (d) are equally used in communication, each with a different meaning nuance. (I4) (a) num31 m3n53 (b) man53 lu35 n Bm31. water spring spring clear water CONTENTS CONTAINER CONTAINER CONTENTS ' spring water' 'The spring has clear water.' (c) m;n53 num31 lu35. (d) nLm31 man53 lu35. spring water clear water spring clear CONTAINER CONTENTS CONTENTS CONTAINER 'As for the spring, its water 'The spring water is clear.' is clear.' Below I list a number of ZoP-constructions displaying various types of non-human possessor-possessee relationships. Again, they share the mean- ing that the possessor is predicated through or in its possessee. (15) khwa35 srUn11 s;t55. dog straight tail ANIMAL BODY PART 'The dog has a straight tail (lit. The dog appears stiffened in its tail).' (I6) ma55 sik13 jim11. dish tasteless salt, salt percentage MASS CONSTITUENT 'The dish lacks salt (lit.

The wine is fragrant with regard to its odour).' The ZoP construction (i8) involves the adjective eV55 'unripe, unfamiliar' imposing a reciprocal reading and requiring both the possessor and the possessee to be interpreted as plural nouns. The type of the possessor- possessee relationship is therefore that of collection-collection of parts, i.e. collection of people-collection of faces. (I8) ta33maU33 oeij55 na323. 3P PL unripe, unfamiliar face COLLECTION COLLECTION OF PARTS 'They are alien to each other (lit. they are unfamiliar in their faces).' 3.1.2 Metaphorical ZoP-constructions Several body part constructions fall in this category, where the body part stands in a metaphorical relationship with the stative predicate. This meta- phorical relationship is in general only available for the ZoP-construction, not for the Np0r-Npee-construction and not for the Np,,-Npor-construction. Since the seminal work of Lakoff &amp; Johnson (I980), it is commonplace to assign to every metaphorical expression (e.g. 'You waste my time') a meta- phorical principle or equation (e.g. 'TIME is MONEY') according to which the expression is derived. Sometimes the metaphorical principle is a subtype of an even more general metonymic principle. In example (igb) below, the adjective jai323 'long' combines with sai323 'intestines' to form the metaphorical expression 'forbearing, long-suffering'. In the Kam ontology, the intestines constitute the seat of a person's emotions and attitudes, similar to the heart in other cultures. The general metaphor at work in the expression in (igb) is therefore 'PATIENCE is (like) the LENGTH OF INTESTINES'. The amount of patience a person has is equated with the length of his intestines. This general metaphor belongs to the even more general metonymic principle 'THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY PART THAT REVEALS AN ATTITUDE STANDS FOR THE ATTITUDE'. I will offer an account of the metaphorical productivity of ZoP-constructions in section 4.7. Any permutation of the order in (Igb) breaks up the metaphor and leads to a literal statement about the length of a person's intestines, resulting in pragmatic oddity, cf. (I9c) and (igd). (I9) (a) sai323 mau33 (b) mau33 jai323 sai323 intestines 3P SG POSS 3P SG long intestines BODY PART PERSON PERSON BODY PART 'his intestines' 'He is forbearing.' 317</page><page sequence="12">MATTHIAS GERNER (c) ?mau" sai121 jai323 (d) ?sai323 mau33 ai323 11 1 mau jai gurj 3P SG intestines long intestines 3P SG long very PERSON BODY PART BODY PART PERSON ('As for him, the intestines ('His intestines are very long'?) are long'?) The next three examples involve metaphorical ZoP-constructions centred on the eyes, the nose and the mouth. Example (20) is a 'double-ZoP- construction'. It combines the colour 'white' with 'eye' and 'nose' to deduce the metaphorical meaning of 'immature'. The idea behind this metaphorical deduction is that young children preserve a bright complexion because they are not exposed to the scorching effects of sunlight (and, by extension, to the hardships of life). The metaphorical principle behind (20) may be sketched as 'MATURITY is (like) the COLOUR OF COMPLEXION'. This metaphor is an articulation of the general metonymic principle 'THE APPEARANCE OF THE BODY PART THAT REVEALS AN ATTRIBUTE STANDS FOR THE ATTRIBUTE'. Again, any permutation of the order of con- stituents would upset the metaphorical relationship between the stative predicate and the possessee and produce a literal statement. (20) mau33 pak3' ta55 pak31 niuj55. 3P SG white eyes white nose PERSON BODY PART BODY PART 'He is immature (lit. he is white at eyes and nose).' In the next example, the degree of abstraction in the metaphorical expression is relatively low. The shape of a person's mouth is taken as an image or indication of his attitude to the activity of speaking (e.g. constant speaker, occasional speaker). The underlying metaphorical equation can be outlined as 'SPEAKING HABIT is (like) the SHAPE OF MOUTH'. This metaphor in turn is associated with the more general metonymic principle 'THE SHAPE OF THE BODY PART THAT REVEALS A HABIT STANDS FOR THE HABIT.' (21) mau33 pie323 3P55. 3P SG flat, spread mouth PERSON BODY PART 'He is a constant speaker (lit. he has her/his mouth spread).' In (22), the shape of a person's mouth is an indication of a person's inner attitude to conflict situations (e.g. conciliatory). Here the mouth is involved in depicting an attitude. The metaphorical principle in operation in (22) iS 'CONFLICT ATTITUDE is (like) the HARDNESS OF MOUTH'. This general metaphor is related to the metonymic principle mentioned above, 'THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY PART THAT REVEALS AN ATTITUDE STANDS FOR THE ATTITUDE.' 318</page><page sequence="13">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) (22) mau33 ma"' ;p". 3P SG soft mouth PERSON BODY PART 'He is always yielding (lit. he is soft in her/his mouth).' 3.2 Subjective or experienced states (sensations and emotions) In contrast to objective states, subjective or experienced states cannot be independently observed, but are experienced only by the animate entity depicted by the state. They correspond to Iwasaki's 'proprioceptive' or 'internal states' (Iwasaki 2002: 34). Without exception, these states involve body parts. There are again two subcategories: literal ZoP-constructions and metaphorical ZoP-constructions. 3.2.J Literal ZoP-constructions Literal ZoP-constructions do not draw on metaphorical processes, but imply straightforward readings of the predicational frame (i.e. Npor-V-Npee). This category includes mainly sensations (e.g. 'pain', 'wellness'), rather than emotions (e.g. 'anger', 'envy'). Literal ZoP-constructions of this type again admit permutations of the constituents that lead to Npor-Npee-constructions and Npee-Npor-constructions. In (23), the feeling of thirst (Kam: 'dry throat') is a sensation subjectively experienced by some animate being. The meaning of 'dry throat' interpreted as 'thirsty' represents a straightforward deduction.

Enjoying good eyesight is primarily a subjectively experienced state (although it can also be made observable or objective through tests). In Kam, this situation is expressed in (24) by 'person-good-eye'. In (25), the heaviness of the body (Kam: 'person-heavy-body') is a subjective sensation or even a pain that is experienced, for example, during fever infections.

In (26b), the ZoP-construction con- strues the metaphorical sense of 'angry' out of the components 'short' and 'breathe'. As in previous examples, the Npor-Npee-construction in (26c) and the Npee-Npor-construction in (26d) cannot convey any metaphorical meaning, but only a literal meaning, which happens to be pragmatically odd. There is again a metonymic formula underlying the ZoP-construction in (26b), which is 'ANGER is (like) the BREATHING CONDITION'. This metaphor is, in turn, associated with the more general metonymic principle 'THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AN EMOTION STAND FOR THE EMOTION' (see also Kovecses I986: 12).

In (27), the adjective sau 323'warm combines with the noun sai323 'intestines' to yield the metaphorical meaning 'be comforted'. The emotional expressions evolving from the Kam noun for 'intestines' are numerous (see the appendix for more examples). The general metaphor associated with (27) is 'COMFORT is (like) the TEMPERATURE OF INTESTINES'. This metaphor belongs again to the metonymic principle 'THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AN EMOTION STAND FOR THE EMOTION'. (27) mau33 sau323 sai323. 3PSG warm intestines PERSON BODY PART 'He is comforted (lit. be warm in one's intestines).' The metaphorical expression 'be red in one's eyes' is a common idiom in Kam, other Kadai languages and even in Mandarin and other Chinese 320</page><page sequence="15">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) dialects to portray the internal emotion of envy. The metaphor underlying this concept of envy is 'ENVY is (like) the COLOUR OF EYES'. The red- ness of eyes is again a physiological effect of the emotion of envy belonging to the general metonymic principle 'THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AN EMOTION STAND FOR THE EMOTION'. (28) mau33 ja453 tas. 3P SG red eye PERSON BODY PART 'He is envious (lit. be red in one's eyes).' Heat in the abdomen is the metaphor to express regret or pity about some state of affairs. The associated metaphorical equation is 'PITY is (like) HEAT OF BELLY'. This metaphor is also an articulation of 'THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AN EMOTION STAND FOR THE EMOTION'. (29) mau33 tun55 1orj11. 3P SG hot belly PERSON BODY PART 'He feels pitiful (lit. be hot in one's belly).' The gall is an internal organ that is positioned in the depths of the belly. When involved with the colour pha35 'grey', it expresses intense fear and fright. It is therefore associated with the metaphorical formula 'FRIGHT is (like) COLOUR OF GALL'. Like all emotions in this section it is also related to the general metonymic formula mentioned above. (30) mau33 pha35 tam323. 3P SG grey intestines PERSON BODY PART 'He is frightened to his inmost being (lit. be grey in one's gall).' 3.3 Processes A process differs from a state in that it expresses a dynamic situation. It differs from an action in that its arguments do not exercise control or volition over the situation. In Kam there are a number of dynamic ZoP-construc- tions. They essentially express that the possessor develops (or is processed) in, at or through its possessee. These ZoP-constructions consist mainly of literal statements or statements with low idiomatic input. In example (31), the possessor-possessee relationship is that of container-contents. In ad- dition to the ZoP-construction, the two other construction types, i.e. Npor-N-Pee-construction and Npee-Npor-construction, represent alternative renderings with sense nuances. 321</page><page sequence="16">MATTHIAS GERNER (31) (a) ma323 mon55 'cloud sky CONTENTS CONTAINER 'cloud (in the sky)' (b) mon55 ha453 ma323. sky ascend cloud CONTAINER CONTENTS 'The sky has clouds going up.'

(d) ma323 man55 0ha453 ljeu31. cloud sky ascend DP CONTENTS CONTAINER 'The clouds have gone up.' Example (32) is similar with regard to the nature of its possessor-possessee relationship. The stove functions here as a container of the fire that gets extinguished. (32) sa1" t3i55 pui55. stove die fire CONTAINER CONTENTS 'The stove has its fire extinguished.' The next example is the normal way in Kam to express that a woman has a miscarriage. It combines the verb 'crumble' with the (holistic) body part 'body'. The body in question does not belong to the aborted infant, but to the woman. (33) mau33 pLnj55 ns55. 3P SG crumble body PERSON BODY PART 'She has a miscarriage (lit. she crumbled in the body).' Example (34) involves the adjective mak323 'big', which has a stative interpretation ('big') and a dynamic interpretation ('become big'). Both interpretations are possible for the ZoP-construction. The potato plant plays the role of possessor and the fruit the role of possessee. (34) mrn'1 mak323 nunss potato plant big fruit PLANT FRUIT 'The potato plant has big fruits (lit. is big in its fruits)/ The potato plant has grown big in its fruits (lit. is big in its fruits).' 322</page><page sequence="17">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) The next example exhibits the possessor-possessee relationship of plant- part ('rice' - 'bud'). It describes the process of sprouting. (35) kau3u peu53 re11. rice crack bud PLANT PART 'The rice has sprouted (lit. The rice has cracked in its buds).' 4. ZOP-CONSTRUCTIONS AND THEORETICAL ISSUES In this section I want to discuss a number of theoretical issues related to ZoP- constructions. In section 4.1, I argue for viewing the possessor and possessee nouns of ZoP-constructions as belonging to one unique noun phrase. In section 4.2, I propose a general and abstract definition of ZoP-constructions that is able to unify a number of constructions with 'zoom-effects'. Furthermore, I discuss whether the phenomena of possessor ascension (section 4.3), active zone (section 4.4), external possession (section 4.5) and noun-incorporation (section 4.6) constitute appropriate concepts to account for ZoP-constructions. Finally, there are interesting features in the structure and the semantics of ZoP-constructions that make them the ideal environ- ment for the development of metaphorical expressions (see section 4.7). 4.I The one-NP and two-NPs hypotheses All the Kam examples investigated so far involve intransitive verbs. A number of interesting questions now arise concerning the relationship between the verb on the one hand and the possessor and the possessee nouns on the other. Should Npor and Npee be accounted for as a single NP or two NPs? Since they appear in different syntactic slots of the ZoP-construction, one is tempted to view them as two distinct NPs. If they are, then it is reasonable to conclude that they must also have different relationships with the verb. What would be their participant roles? The problem is that the intransitive verbs explored in section 3 can only have one participant role, i.e. zero or processed (for a definition of these participant roles see footnote 5). Generally speaking, a verb can allocate at most one participant role of each category: one zero, one agent, one patient, etc. It is possible to have a zero (or an agent, or a patient, etc.) that is complex, such as a noun modified by a relative clause or a possessive compound noun, but it would only count as ONE NP, as ONE participant role. However, there are languages, such as English and Kam, whose lexicons are full of verbs with intransitive and monotransitive uses (e.g. 'narrow': 'the channel is narrow', 'the road narrows ', 'he narrows his view'). The monotransitive uses are related to the intransitive ones through a causative valency increase in the verb (cf. Dixon &amp; Aikhenvald 2000: 12f.). The problem with this explanation is that the 323</page><page sequence="18">MATTHIAS GERNER Kam examples of section 3 do not have a causative meaning. They do not really increase the valency. Let us again consider (27). (27) mau3 sau323 sai323 3P SG warm intestines PERSON BODY PART 'He is comforted (lit. be warm in one's intestines).' In (27), the person is not the causer of the comfort or of the feelings in the intestines. Instead, both the person and the intestines share the same state of warmth. It seems therefore more appropriate to allocate the participant role of zero to both the person and the body part. However, it follows from this that both must form ONE NP, because each verb can only assign one par- ticipant role of each category. I suggest that the ZoP-construction be viewed as integrating one split-NP composed of the possessor and the possessee rather than as giving separate NP status to both the possessor and the possessee. The two-NP interpretation would lead us to a conflict with theories of semantic roles, which assume that every simple clause admits no more than one participant role of each category. A tentative solution to the problems posed by the two-NP interpretation would be to say that one of the NPs does not bear any relationship to the verb. This path was followed witlin the Relational Grammar framework, which adopted the notion 'ch6meur relation' (cf. Perlmutter &amp; Postal 1983: 6if.). However, it is not the case that one of the NPs has been 'fired' by the verb. As example (27) shows, both nouns share a semantic relation to the verb, i.e. the role of zero. 4.2 Formal definition and major subtypes Having taken a position on the issues concerning the one-NP and two-NPs hypotheses, we can now consider a general definition of ZoP-constructions. The ZoP-constructions explored in section 3 assign to both the possessor and the possessee either the role zero or the role processed. The characterization I propose will relate to 'zoom-on-possessee' in other participant roles (e.g. patient). My characterization comes close to the system of constructions proposed by Anderson (I974), which he calls 'the part-whole squish'. I will first redefine the notion of Npee-Npor-construction (cf. section 2.2). Let V be a verb or a compound verb with m participant roles (in general, m = I, 2 or 3). We suppose that the m participant roles of V are ordered: X1, ..., Xk, . . ., Xm (e.g. X1 = agent, X2 = patient, X3 = instrument). We may represent a predi- cation involving V by the formula V(N1, ..., Nk, ..., Nm). A POSSESSEE-POSSESSOR CONSTRUCTION IN THE XK-ROLE (henceforth, NPee-Npor-Xk-construction) is a predication such that one of its arguments is a compound noun with a semantic possessor-possessee relationship: V(Ni I... Nk =Npee-Npor, , Nm) 324</page><page sequence="19">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) In section 3 above, one portion of the (d)-examples are Npee-Np0r--Zero- constructions, while another portion concern Npee-Npor-Processed- constructions. The following example is an Npee-Npor-Patient-construction, since the possessee-possessor noun phrase occupies the participant role of patient: (36) The dog bit Cliffs ankle. We come now to the definition of ZoP-constructions. A ZOOM-ON- POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN THE XK-ROLE (henceforth, ZoP-Xk-construction) is a simple clause with the following features: (i) there are two nouns, Npor and Npee, that stand in a semantic possessor- possessee relationship; (ii) Npor and Npee are not grouped together as one single compound noun in the clause but are morpho-syntactically distinguished (e.g. they are in different word-order slots); (iii) the construction conveys the meaning that the possessor Npor is predicated (i.e. affects, is affected, processes, is processed, is evaluated, etc.) IN, AT or THROUGH its possessee Npee; (iv) there is a Npee-Npor-Xk-construction, V(N1, ..., Nk = Npee-Npor, ... Nm), with an almost equivalent meaning, where the sole difference between the two constructions is that the Npee-Npor-Xk-construction does not have a 'zoom-effect', i.e. the entity which is predicated is Npee independent from Npor, while in the ZoP-Xk-construction the predi- cated entity is Npor IN, AT or THROUGH NPee. Concerning (iv), I have carefully avoided stating that one of the two con- structions is more prominent than the other or that one construction is derived from the other. This issue will be carefully discussed in section 4.3. The above definition generates a family of ZoP-constructions, each based on a particular participant role. 4.2.1 ZoP-constructions in the zero-role This type of ZoP-construction in Kam was explored in sections 3.I and 3.2. As the present section shows, it is not unfamiliar in European languages. Consider the following example from French: (37) (a) Sylvie est jolie des yeux. (ZoP-Zero- NAME OF GIRL COP pretty of-the eyes construction) PERSON BODY PART Sylvie is pretty in the eyes.' (b) Les yeux de Sylvie sont jolies. (Npee-Npor-Zero- the eyes of NAME OF GIRL COP pretty construction) BODY PART PERSON 'The eyes of Sylvie are pretty.' 325</page><page sequence="20">MATTHIAS GERNER The (a) version constitutes a ZoP-construction in the zero-role and (b), a possessee-possessor construction in the zero-role. It is clear that in the (b) version there is no 'zoom effect'. In English there is an array of similar ZoP-expressions, such as 'be advanced in age', 'be tall of stature', etc. English expressions like 'be long-haired' and 'be blue-eyed' are probably also ZoP-constructions. They all share the characteristic that the state or the property holds both locally at the possessee, and globally at the possessor through the possessee. 4.2.2 ZoP-constructions in the processed-role The Kam examples in section 3.3 are representative of this ZoP-construction type. Expressions like 'have one's hair growing quickly' and 'have one's hand bleeding' are the English counterparts of the Kam examples. Both the possessor and the possessee share the same participant role of processed. The possessor is processed IN or THROUGH its possessee. The verb of the English examples takes the structure 'have + ... + V + ing'. 4.2.3 ZoP-constructions in the positioner- and agent-role A ZoP-construction in the positioner-role would be a construction in which the possessor holds a position IN, AT or THROUGH its possessee. Consider the following examples: (38) (a) John stands there on one leg. (b) ?John's one's leg stands there. (39) (a) Peter holds a book in his hands. (b) ?Peter's hands hold a book. (40) (a) Mary keeps this event in her heart. (b) ?Mary's heart keeps this event. It appears that the (b) versions are slightly odd. In an anthropomorphic view of body parts, however, both (a) and (b) would be acceptable. An anthropo- morphic view of body parts is a perspective where human-like properties (e.g. 'volition') are imputed to the body part. The reason for the oddness of (38b), (39b) and (4ob) is that positional verbs require a positioner that is capable of volition and control. Body parts are controlled but do not exercise independent control. Consequently, it is not possible to establish the existence of an Npee-Npor-Positioner-construction that would be parallel to the (a) version, the putative ZoP-Positioner-construction. Since the existence of a parallel Npee-Npor-Positioner-construction is required in the definition of ZoP-construction, it appears that ZoP-constructions in the positioner-role are not grammaticalized in English. A language that allows its positional verbs to integrate both a volitional and an unvolitional positioner in their predication frame would probably admit this type of ZoP-construction. I am 326</page><page sequence="21">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) not aware of any language that exhibits ZoP-constructions in the positioner- role. Agents are the prime arguments of actions. Agents resemble positioners in that they are capable of volition and control. A ZoP-construction in the agent-role is a construction in which the agent acts IN, AT or THROUGH its possessee. Let us again contemplate two examples from English: (41) (a) John kicked him with his leg. (b) ?John's leg kicked him. (42) (a) The cat bit him with its teeth. (b) ?The cat's teeth bit him. Again, the (b) versions sound odd, because the action verbs require an agent that is capable of volition and control. The body parts of animate beings lack critical properties of volition and control. As a result, it is not possible to posit the existence of an Npee-Npor-Agent-construction that would be parallel to the (a) versions. Again, this entails that in English there are no ZoP-constructions in the agent-role. I also have no knowledge of any language that has grammaticalized this form of ZoP-construction. Positioner and agent are the only entities that do not permit ZoP- constructions. In contrast with all the other participant roles examined in this section, positioners and agents exercise control over the situation, while the other roles do not. Thus, the impossibility of exercising control is a sufficient condition for the existence of ZoP-constructions. 4.2.4 ZoP-constructions in the force-role A force is the non-controlling entity instigating a process. Forces do not manifest the same restrictions as agents (see section 4.2.3). Consider the following examples: (43) (a) The oak has raised the house through its dense roots. (b) The dense roots of the oak have raised the house. (44) (a) The engine drove us crazy with its noise. (b) The engine's noise drove us crazy. In the (a) versions, the force affects the patient through the possessee. The (a) versions admit parallel constructions (b) where the possessee is viewed as if it was an entity separated from the possessor. In all the versions, the possessor and the possessee share the participant role of force. Thus, examples (43a) and (44a) satisfy all the criteria of ZoP-constructions in the force-role. 4.2.5 ZoP-constructions in the patient-role ZoP-constructions of this type have been widely discussed in the literature, mainly in the context of possessor ascension (see section 4.3 below). They 327</page><page sequence="22">MATTHIAS GERNER relate to simple clauses whose patient NP consists of a possessee-possessor compound ( = Npee-Npor-Patient-constructions), illustrated in (45) and (46). (45) (a) The dog bit Cliff on the ankle. (ZoP-Patient-construction) (b) The dog bit Cliff's ankle. (Npee-Npor-Patient-construction) (46) (a) I kicked him in the leg. (ZoP-Patient-construction) (b) I kicked his leg. (Npee-Np0r-Patient-construction) Superficially, in (45a) and (46a) English encodes the possessor as a patient and the possessee as a locative noun phrase, but from a strictly semantic viewpoint the possessee also functions as patient. The possessor and the possessee are both patients. There is again a 'zoom effect' incorporated in the semantics of these examples. The possessor is affected IN, AT or THROUGH its possessee. In (45b) and (46b), this 'zoom effect' is absent. The affected entity is the body part, which is presented as if it was an entity separated from its possessor. In languages such as French, the possessor of the ZoP-construction is marked as a dative and the possessee as a patient. Wierzbicka (1979: 316f.) paraphrases the 'zoom-effect' of the ZoP-construction in (47a) below in the following way: Though the speaker recognizes that something happens to that part of the body, he emphasizes, by his choice of syntactic construction, that he views the event as concerning the entire person: the act of washing the person's head is viewed in this case as washing this person -'with respect to the head'. (47) (a) Pierrei luij a lav6 la t&amp;tej. (ZoP-Patient- NAME OF BOY 3P SG:DAT has wash the head construction) PERSON BODY PART 'Pierre has washed him the head.' (b) Pierrei luij a lav6 saj tete. (Npee-Npor- NAME OF BOY 3P SG: DAT has wash 3P SG Poss head Patient- PERSON BODY PART construction) 'Pierre has washed him his head.' The dative personal pronoun lui in (47b) cannot be omitted, otherwise the possessive pronoun in sa tete would be coreferential with Pierre. In (47b) the head is viewed as something separate from, albeit related to, the person. In Kam, this type of ZoP-construction is not attested. Speakers would choose a possessee-possessor construction to express the meaning of affect- ing a person's body part. A permutation of the order of the possessor and the possessee results in ungrammaticality :8 [8] In Mandarin, there is a construction, called 'retained-object construction' (cf. Thompson 1973), involving the coverb bd, a preverbal possessor noun and a postverbal possessee noun, as in ta pao-qu bd da men shang-le dd shuan 'He ran and secured the big bolt on the front 328</page><page sequence="23">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) (48) (a) *khwa"S kit3" mau33 pa55 dog bite 3P SG leg PERSON BODY PART ('The dog bites him on the leg.'*) (b) khwa 3 kit3' pa55 mau33. dog bite leg 3P SG BODY PART PERSON 'The dog bites his leg.' Kam does not admit ZoP-Patient-constructions, but it permits passive constructions derived from active constructions with a patient. As we will see in the next section, these passive constructions show the 'zoom-effect' of ZoP-constructions. 4.2.6 Passive of in/alienable possession In a recent paper (Gerner 2003), I have demonstrated that the passive in Kam (and related Kadai languages) occupies a unique position on the worldwide map of passive constructions. In contrast to the passive in other regions of the world, Kam involves a matrix verb as sole marker of passive (the matrix verb tOU33 'touch, encounter'). Passive constructions in Kam are, technically, complex clauses. One requirement of ZoP-constructions is that they constitute simple clauses. Passives therefore do not form ZoP- constructions. Nevertheless, there is a 'zoom-effect' for a passive subtype that I call 'passive of in/alienable possession' (Gerner 2003: 59-6I). Consider the following examples: (49) (a) mau33 tau33 khe35 0p55 ho53. (Passive of alienable 3P SG DOUH 3P PL collect goods, things possession) OWNER BELONGINGS 'He endured the collecting of his things by others.' (b) ho53 mau33 tgu33 khe3s top55. (Possessee-possessor goods, things 3P SG douh 3P PL collect passive) BELONGINGS OWNER 'His things were collected by others.' (49a) constitutes a passive of alienable possession. The meaning is that someone is affected through his belongings. This exhibits the same 'zoom effect' as in the ZoP-constructions introduced in the preceding sections. door'. In this example, the possessor is underlined with a single line and the possessee with a double line. The retained-object construction constitutes a ZoP-patient-construction. However, not all the examples of retained object in Thompson's paper are acceptable for Mandarin speakers. While checking the sentences with a native speaker of Mandarin, we found several sentences odd, such as ta bd juzi bdo-le pi 'He peeled the orange' (cf. Thompson 1973: 210). 329</page><page sequence="24">MATTHIAS GERNER (49b) groups the possessee and the possessor together in sentence-initial position. It presents the goods as something separate from the owner. (See Gerner (2003: 59-6I) for further examples, especially of the inalienable possession type.) 4.3 Multi-stratal approaches.* the issue of 'possessor ascension' Multi-stratal approaches treat differences among synonymous or near- synonymous forms by allocating them to different levels of representation and by stipulating syntactic inheritance rules between the levels.9 In contrast, mono-stratal approaches do not introduce a hierarchy between two formally different, (near-)synonymous constructions. They handle form variance as a combined matter of syntax, semantics and pragmatics. In this and the following section, I will look at ZoP-constructions from the standpoint of two approaches: Relational Grammar (multi-stratal, this section) and Cognitive Grammar (mono-stratal, next section). The paper is intended to be theory-neutral and its main objective is to present original empirical data and to show how they support or undermine existing linguistic theories. However, the spirit in which ZoP-constructions have been introduced in 4.2 certainly reveals affinities with a construction-based (mono-stratal) approach. In section 4.2, I posited the existence of a parallel Npee-Npor- construction as central to the notion of ZoP-construction. A number of scholars have claimed that for one particular ZoP-construction type (i.e. ZoP-Patient-constructions) the Npee-Npor-construction is the basic or underlying one from which the ZoP-construction is derived (e.g. Davies I98I; Fox I98I). This derivation is called 'possessor ascension' and involves two phenomena that I have exemplified in section 4.2.5. The first ascension phenomenon sees the possessor as arising from its modifier position to the position of patient (or direct object), while the possessee is demoted to the status of oblique, cf. (45a) and (46a) above. Concerning the second ascension phenomenon, the possessor moves from its position of modifier into the position of benefactive or indirect object, while the possessee remains intact in the patient position. The French examples (47) is of this type. Scholars working in the Relational Grammar framework (RG; mainly Blake i984: 444-448, 1990: 99-103) have objected to the idea that the above structures constitute ascension phenomena. Following the work of Perlmutter &amp; Postal (i983), ascension phenomena are captured through the [9] Generative frameworks may differ in the extent to which they require strict synonymy. Many earlier generativists thought that complete synonymy was not required to postulate a deep structure (e.g. Partee I965, 1971). A theory that makes explicit mention of identical semantics is Relational Grammar with the UNIVERSAL ALIGNMENT HYPOTHESIS ('There exists some set of universal principles which will map the semantic representation of a clause onto the initial grammatical relations' (Perlmutter &amp; Postal I983; see also discussion in this section)). 330</page><page sequence="25">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) application of laws. According to the Relational Succession Law, the ascendee assumes within the clause in which it ascends the grammatical relation of its host NP, while according to the Stratal Uniqueness Law, the host moves into a chomeur position. Blake remarks that this analysis works reasonably well for the possessor-to-direct-object cases (e.g. The dog bit Cliff on the ankle)."0 The same analysis, however, fails for the possessor-to-indirect-object instances (e.g. French: Ili luij lave la tetej 'He washes him the head'). Here the ascendee does not move to assume the grammatical relation of its host; the host also retains its grammatical status and does not move to ch6meur. The Relational Succession Role works well for the ZoP-Zero-construc- tions and ZoP-Processed-constructions explored in section 3. Consider example (50), where the (a) version is a Npee-Npor-construction and the (b) version is a ZoP-construction. (50) (a) ko11 mau33 so 323. (b) mau33 so323 koll throat 3P SG POSS dry 3P SG dry throat BODY PART PERSON PERSON BODY PART 'His throat is dry.' 'He is thirsty (lit. be dry in the throat).' In (b), the possessor ascendee assumes the grammatical relation that was occupied by the host possessee in (a), while the possessee in (b) loses the grammatical status it had in (a). This fits well in the possessor ascension scheme so far. The main objection of Relational Grammarians to the possessor ascension analysis is semantic. An assumption in RG is that there is no semantic differ- ence between the 'clause before ascension' and the 'clause after ascension'.11 As is clear from the preceding sections, there is a semantic difference between ZoP-constructions and Npee-Npor-constructions, which I have termed 'zoom-effect'. The former construction expresses a 'zoom-effect', while the latter does not. However, the assumption underlying RG about the synonymity of the clauses before and after ascension seems to be question- able. ZoP-constructions and Npee-Npor-constructions offer different con- ceptualisations of the same situation. It is not clear why absolute semantic conformity is required in order to call a phenomenon an ascension phenom- enon. Indeed Blake acknowledges that some Relational Grammarians do not take this assumption as an axiom of the framework (Blake I990: 103) and allow alternative semantics for unascended and ascended clauses. [io] The example The dog bit Cliff ON THE ANKLE iS complicated because it admits other prep- ositions, such as The dog bit Clifj under the ankle. This would pose problems for the interpretation of the ankle as chomeur. We will not go deeper into this problem here. [ii] The prototypical example often cited is 'subject ascension': It happens that I am leaving (clause before ascension) and I happen to be leaving (clause after ascension). The assump- tion of semantic synonymy is implied by the Universal Alignment Hypothesis (see footnote 9; see also Blake I990: 102). 33I</page><page sequence="26">MATTHIAS GERNER Consequently, it seems possible to view ZoP-Zero-constructions and ZoP-Processed-constructions as being derived from Npee-Npor-Zero- constructions and Npee-Npor-Processed-constructions, respectively, through a process of possessor ascension. Concerning ZoP-Patient-constructions, there are syntactic problems as detailed above and one should be more cautious about viewing them as products of possessor ascension. For this reason, in the general definition of ZoP-constructions (section 4.2), I have not posited any construction as more basic, from which the other would be derived. 4.4 Mono-stratal solutions: the notion of 'active zone' Many mono-stratal approaches attribute linking, i.e. the mapping of par- ticipant roles onto syntactic functions, directly to the lexicon or to lexical constructions, in contrast to universal semantic assignment mechanisms (see Pinker I989; Langacker iggib; Goldberg 1995; Davies &amp; Koenig 2000). The notion of construction adopted in this paper comes very close to that elaborated in those works. I have chosen the Cognitive Grammar framework (CGJ; Langacker I987, iggia) with its notions of 'alternate construal' (Langacker I987: 138ff.) and 'active zone' (Langacker 9ggib) to profile ZoP- constructions. Although CG has not been tested with the set of data pres- ented in this paper, there are clear hints as to how this model may be applied to ZoP-constructions. Langacker (IggIb: I8gff.) points to the pervasiveness of whole-part discrepancies in ordinary linguistic expressions. In many circumstances entities are predicated as wholes (e.g. your dog bit my cat), even though, strictly speaking, only parts of them are involved or affected (e.g. the dog's mouth and the cat's leg). Langacker introduces the notion of 'active zone', which refers to those portions of a trajectory and/or a land- mark that participate directly in a given relation. The aim is to obviate derivation rules of the type introduced above and to account for parallel structures such as the ZoP/Npee-Np '-constructions by postulating that the dichotomy is merely a matter of perspective or - in the CG vocabulary - a matter of relative prominence of substructures (Langacker I99Ib: 195). Let us illustrate this line of application by considering (5o) again. (50) (a) ko1l mau33 so323. (b) mau33 so323 ko1 throat 3PSG POSS dry 3PSG dry throat BODY PART PERSON PERSON BODY PART 'His throat is dry.' 'He is thirsty (lit. be dry in the throat).' The domain of both predications is the same, i.e. the concept 'a rate scale of humidity'.12 This scale has an 'entrance region' (e) beyond which values are [12] To simplify the representation, let's suppose that this scale is linear. 332</page><page sequence="27">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) evaluated as dry. This 'dry' region functions as landmark. The trajectory of (5oa) is the throat as part of a person, while for (sob) it is the whole person. The active zone (AZ) of both predications differs also. In (5oa) only the throat is highlighted (thick black line), whereas for (sob) both the whole and its part are prominent. The two situations are illustrated in (5i). (5') throat throat 4 QAZ (AZ) S A i1 ~~~Im I|ll Person e Person (tr/AZ) e (a) (b) In a similar way, it is easy to conceive how the other ZoP-constructions defined in section 4.2 may be characterized by the CG apparatus. The CG framework with its 'active zone' notion appears to be adaptable to account for the whole range of ZoP-constructions. 4.5 ZoP-constructions and external possession The notion of ZoP-construction is quite reminiscent of what has been called 'external possession' (EP) in the literature, e.g. Vergnaud &amp; Zubizarreta (1992), Haspelmath (I999), Payne &amp; Barshi (iggga), Konig (2001). I want to show in this section that EP-constructions, as defined in the literature, are properly included in the class of ZoP-constructions. Payne &amp; Barshi (i999a: 3) mention three criteria for EP-constructions. These are constructions in which a semantic possessor-possessee relation is expressed by (i) coding the possessor as a core grammatical relation of the verb (i.e. as subject or in/direct object but not as oblique), (ii) coding the possessor in a constituent separate from the one which contains the possessee, and (iii) excluding the possessor from the argument frame of the verb root itself. By placing these properties in contrast with the defining features of ZoP- constructions, it is evident that property (ii) easily falls in line with the requirements of section 4.2 above. As for (i), EP-constructions restrict the number of grammatical relations the possessor may occupy, while this issue is left deliberately ambiguous for ZoP-constructions. In fact, nothing is required of ZoP-constructions themselves; rather, the issue of grammatical relations is made explicit (though not restricted) for their twins, the possessor-possessee constructions. Moreover, the grammatical relations con- sidered there do not concern the possessor alone, but the possessor-possessee 333</page><page sequence="28">MATTHIAS GERNER complex as a whole. In spite of this, the semantic zoom requirement of ZoP- constructions,13 which does not feature prominently in the EP literature,14 virtually ensures that the possessor is encoded as a prominent grammatical relation. The really problematic criterion is (iii), which would deny most ZoP- constructions the status of EP-constructions. Not only would none of the Kam examples considered in this paper count as EPs (since for these ZoP- constructions the possessor occurs as the core argument), but also many others would fall out off the picture, such as John punched Peter on the nose (which I have called ZoP-construction in the patient role). This situation is intended by the idea of EP, as external possessors typically constitute 'extra-thematic' arguments. Typical examples that are accounted for by the concept of EP include dative constructions such as the German example in (52) (see also section 4.2.5 for French examples). (52) (a) Ich habe meine Haare gewaschen. (Npee-Npor-Patient- IP SG have my hair washed construction) PERSON BODY PART 'I have washed my hair.' (b) Ich habe mir die Haare gewaschen. (EP-construction) IP SG have me :DAT the hair washed PERSON BODY PART 'I have washed me the hair.' In (52b), mir (IP SG DAT) is an extra-thematic argument of the mono-transitive verb waschen 'wash'. Clauses such as (52b) were featured in section 4.2.5 as matching the semantics of ZoP-constructions, since the action of washing is presented as affecting the whole person at the locus of the hair. In summary, we may say that the concept of EP is narrower than that of ZoP in the sense that the class of EP-constructions is properly included in the class of ZoP-constructions. 4.6 The noun-incorporation analysis In this section I discuss whether it is possible to interpret the Kam ZoP- constructions described in section 3 as cases of noun-incorporation, as pro- posed by Clark (I996: 541-544) for a number of Southeast Asian languages. The phenomenon of noun-incorporation was historically first described for American Indian languages (Sapir I9II). Noun-incorporation is generally defined in the literature as a morphological process by which a noun (stem) is [13] That is to say that the possessor is predicated IN, AT or THROUGH the possessee. [14] Occasionally one can read statements like 'External possessor constructions typically imply that the possessor is strongly affected by the action or event denoted by the rest of the sentence' (e.g. Konig 2001: 972). 334</page><page sequence="29">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) compounded with a verb (stem) to yield a derived verb. The properties acquired by the derived verb are multi-layered and can be one or several of the following (most of these characteristics have been observed in synthetic or polysynthetic languages): I. Phonological characteristics (Mardirussian 1975): vowel assimilation or loss of segments in the incorporated noun phonological changes in the verb 2. Morphological characteristics (Mardirussian I975): loss of bound morphemes in the incorporated noun the incorporated noun may be intercalated between bound mor- phemes of the verb 3. Syntactic characteristics: in verb-initial languages the incorporated noun attaches to the right of the verb, while in verb-final languages it attaches to the left of the verb (Mardirussian I975) the verb becomes intransitive (Mithun's type I) or maintains transi- tivity by admitting a new category of objects (Mithun's type II) (Mithun 1984) secondary semantic roles (e.g. instrument, locative, benefactive) are unlikely to (Perlmutter &amp; Postal 1974: 'cannot') be incorporated the incorporated nouns cannot be modified by plural morphemes, adjectives or other determiners (Mardirussian 1975) TAM (tense, aspect, modality) morphemes cannot intervene between the verb and the incorporated noun, but must be placed outside the unit (Mithun 1984: 850) 4. Semantic characteristics: the incorporated noun becomes non-referential (thus pronouns and proper nouns cannot incorporate) (Mardirussian 1975: 386f.; Mithun I984: 856) the derived verb tends to be idiomatic (Mardirussian 1975: 387). Clark (I996: 541-544) cautiously analyses certain, notably metaphorical, ZoP-Zero-constructions of Southeast Asian languages as cases of noun- incorporation. She acknowledges that almost no 'morphological indicator' of the kind displayed in the list above is available to sustain this claim. Yet she views the morphological process of compounding in itself, especially if revealed by a metaphorical derivation, already as a defining feature of noun-incorporation. In addition to morphology, she regards the syntactic property of valency-shifting in the ZoP-constructions as another indicator of noun-incorporation. The ZoP-Zero-constructions fit Mithun's noun- incorporation type II (Mithun 1984: 856) because the incorporated noun 335</page><page sequence="30">MATTHIAS GERNER loses its syntactic status, while the derived verb creates a new subject (i.e. zero) position, which is filled by an oblique element, the possessor, through a process of possessor ascension (see section 4.3). I think that these are two valid arguments (one morphological, one syntactic) in favour of the noun-incorporation analysis. The fact that none of the phonological and morphological features mentioned above can be observed in Southeast Asian languages is to be explained by their analytic-morphological type. In these languages most words consist of one or two morphemes. Processes such as assimilation or loss of segments are generally rare phenomena in these languages, independently of the question of noun-incorporation. Yet there are also strong arguments against the noun-incorporation analysis. In many of the body-part cases, the body part is referential, in contrast to one of the features in the above list. Consider again (sob), where the possessee is referential, pointing to a specific body part of a definite person. 33 32333 33 1 (50) (a) koll mau so (b) mau33 so323 koll throat 3P SG POSS dry 3P SG dry throat BODY PART PERSON PERSON BODY PART 'His throat is dry.' 'He is thirsty (lit. be dry in the throat).' This characteristic is valid even for many of the metaphorical examples. In addition, there are cases where it is possible to modify the possessee by a count expression or a demonstrative. Consider the following example: (53) man55 tha453 sam35 ta323 ma323. sky ascend NUM: 3 CL cloud CONTAINER CONTENTS 'The sky has three clouds going up.' In Kam, aspect particles occur at the end of the clause after the direct object or after the possessee in ZoP-constructions. It is therefore impossible to test with aspect particles the degree of inseparability of the verb-possessee compound. This quick tour yields a mixed picture. There are factors in favour of the noun-incorporation analysis and also factors in favour of its irrelevance. The balance probably tips towards its irrelevance. 4.7 Explaining the metaphorical productivity of ZoP-constructions In this section I first establish an inventory of the principal metaphor types and principles involved in the ZoP-Zero-constructions presented in section 3 and in the appendix. I then examine the question of why these metaphors uniquely emerge from ZoP-constructions and why Npee-Npor-constructions are unproductive in this regard. 336</page><page sequence="31">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) Probably the first systematic exploration of the role of metaphor in the colloquial language was the influential work of Lakoff &amp; Johnson (I980). According to them 'the essence of metaphor is understanding and experi- encing one kind of thing in terms of another' (I980: 5). The order of the understanding is significant, since it is always the more complex, the more abstract which is understood and experienced through the less complex and the less abstract (cf. Claudi &amp; Heine I986: 300). The principal merit of Lakoff &amp; Johnson's approach is the assignment of each metaphorical expression to an abstract formula-like equation type, which indicates how this expression is derived from a literal statement. For example, the metaphorical expression My mind is a little rusty today is derived from the literal statement the machine is rusty through the metaphorical formula or principle 'the MIND is (like) a MACHINE' (cf. Lakoff &amp; Johnson I980: 27). One can often assign the metaphorical principle to a metaphor class defined by a metonymic principle. For example, the general metaphor above belongs to the metaphor class 'PHYSICAL OBJECT STANDS FOR SPIRITUAL ENTITY'. In section 3, I spelled out metaphorical equations and general metonymic principles for each (metaphorical) Kam example. These equations and principles are set out in the following list: A. Attribute I. THE APPEARANCE OF THE BODY PART THAT REVEALS AN ATTRIBUTE STANDS FOR THE ATTRIBUTE (i) MATURITY is (like) the COLOUR OF COMPLEXION B. Attitude II. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY PART THAT REVEALS AN ATTITUDE STANDS FOR THE ATTITUDE (ii) PATIENCE is (like) the LENGTH OF INTESTINES (iii) CONFLICT ATTITUDE is (like) the SOFTNESS OF MOUTH C. Habit III. THE SHAPE OF THE BODY PART THAT REVEALS A HABIT STANDS FOR THE HABIT (iv) SPEAKING HABIT is (like) the SHAPE OF MOUTH D. Emotion IV. THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AN EMOTION STAND FOR THE EMOTION (v) ANGER is (like) the BREATHING CONDITION (vi) COMFORT is (like) the TEMPERATURE OF INTESTINES 337</page><page sequence="32">MATTHIAS GERNER (vii) ENVY is (like) the COLOUR OF EYES (viii) PITY is (like) HEAT OF BELLY (ix) FRIGHT is (like) COLOUR OF GALL Some brief remarks are in order. Among the metaphors in the list, the emotion-related ones are the richest and the most numerous. Thus, emotions seem to present a greater need to be represented by palpable concepts than attitudes and habits, which tend to be more overt and explicit in nature. It thus makes sense to see for emotions a greater need to be rep- resented by more palpable concepts. This explains the relatively high number of emotion-related metaphors. Furthermore, it is obvious that almost all, if not all, of the Kam metaphorical ZoP-constructions involve body parts. Body parts constitute one part in the explanation of the meta- phorical productivity of ZoP-constructions, but there are also other factors involved. In ZoP-constructions, the possessor and the possessee have the same semantic relationship to the verb (cf. section 4.I). The essence of the 'zoom- effect' is to view the relation that the possessor has to the verb through the lens of the relationship that the possessee has to the verb. This corresponds exactly to the way metaphors work: view something complex through the lens of something simple. It is quite plausible that the possessor, and also its relationship to the verb, is the more complex, the more holistic entity, while the possessee (and its relationship to the verb) constitutes the simpler entity. Thus, given its general semantic structure, every ZoP-construction has a natural tendency towards metaphor, though it can also opt for not out- putting idiomatic meaning. In Npee-Npor-constructions, on the other hand, only the possessee entertains a relationship to the verb, while the possessor is in a kind of ch6meur-role. There is no 'zoom-effect' in these constructions. It is not possible to express the possessor's relationship to the verb by the possessee's relationship to the verb. The structural settings of Npee-Np0r-constructions do not allow them to develop metaphorical reinterpretations. A final word about the productivity of the ZoP-constructions in section 3 may be appropriate. As for unidiomatic 'zoom-effects' (see sections 3.I.I and 3.2.1), productivity is controlled by the semantics of the predicate. As long as a possessor-possessee compound can appear in the frame of the predicate (or in other words, as long as a possessor-possessee construction exists), a corresponding ZoP-construction is available too. Concerning metaphorical 'zoom-effects', though there are abundant examples in the Kam lexicon (see appendix), productivity is limited in the sense that native speakers cannot freely make new additions to the already large inventory. Zoom- constructions have been established over time and are recognized socially. This is not to postulate that ZoP-constructions are idiomatically unpro- ductive (the contrary is probably true), but productivity would have to be 338</page><page sequence="33">ZOOM-ON-POSSESSEE CONSTRUCTION IN KAM (DONG) measured as a long process over time. Unfortunately few comparative data of this type are available today. 5. CONCLUSION This paper has considered a form of intransitive possessive construction in Kam in which the possessor occurs in preverbal position and the possessee occurs in postverbal position. This construction type exhibits a so-called 'zoom-effect': the possessor is predicated IN, AT or THROUGH his/her/its possessee. I have demonstrated that 'zoom-effects' exist not only for subjects of intransitive constructions, but also for a number of other participant roles in mono-transitive constructions. This leads to a general concept of zoom- on-possessee constructions that is able to handle an array of construction types explored in the literature: possessor ascension (multi-stratal), Cognitive Grammar's active zone (mono-stratal), external possession and noun-incorporation are all concepts which have been advanced by various scholars. I demonstrate that possessor ascension is not a concept that can account for all the types of ZoP-constructions, but only for certain types. The ZoP-constructions in the participant role zero fit well the possessor ascension theme, while those in the patient role suit less well. On the other hand, the active zone concept appears to play a much better host for the 'zoom-effects' discussed in the paper. The notion of external possession constitutes a much narrower concept than that of ZoP-constructions. Furthermore, I have shown that the Kam ZoP-constructions in the zero-role exhibit features that are commonly attributed to the phenomenon of noun- incorporation. At the same time, however, ZoP-constructions also display features that are opposed to the concept of noun-incorporation. Finally, ZoP-constructions constitute the ideal semantico-syntactic environment for the development of metaphorical expressions. The essence of metaphors is to understand a more complex entity through a simpler one. ZoP-construc- tions predicate a complex entity IN, AT or THROUGH the simpler possessee. 339</page><page sequence="34">MATTHIAS GERNER APPENDIX List of ZoP-expressions in Kam ordered by the type of possession There are fourteen possession types admitting ZoP-constructions.
