<plain_text><page sequence="1">Indigenous Agronomics and Agricultural Development in the Indus Basin RICHARD KURIN Symbolic anthropology, often preoccupied with expressive systems or classificatory schema, has generally been regarded as having little to contribute to development issues. Here, the symbolic analysis of Punjabi agriculture in Pakistan's Indus Basin reveals an anthropomorphic humoral agronomy used by farmers to make crop production decisions. This agronomy is found to be systemic, coherent, and empirically constituted. Innovations of the green revolution, while productively and conceptually accommodated within this system, have led farmers to consider contervailing hot, crop-centered and cool, soil-centered production strategies. Findings suggest ways in which seed, fertilizer, and water resource development and extension servicing may be pursued, and lead to a general discussion of the uniqueness of the anthropological contribution to development studies and its consistency with par- ticipatory approaches. The pologists increasing in development involvement issues of has anthro- intensified pologists in development issues has intensified debate concerning the substantive contributions to be made by the discipline (e.g., Foster 1969; Arensberg and Niehoff 1970; Sanday 1976; Thompson 1976; Cochrane 1979; Vivelo 1980) and the types of strategies to be encouraged by its profes- sionals (e.g., Brokensha and Hodge 1969; Cochrane 1971; Pitt 1976; van Willigen 1979; Shimkin and Tax 1979; Schwartz 1981). Here it is argued that symbolic anthropology, directed toward the analysis of cultural systems, offers a contribution that is distinctly anthropological and at the same time well- suited to those development programs and projects that seek to incorporate appropriate or participatory strategies in their design and implementation. In this case, the cultural analysis of the system of agronomical knowledge used by Pakistani peasant farmers reveals the rationale for agricultural practice and for the ways in which inputs of the green revolution have been accepted, modified, or rejected. Based on field research in Chakpur, a Punjabi village, and performed under the auspices of the UNDP and the Government of Pakistan Indus Basin Master Planning Project, the paper explicates the in- digenous conceptual scheme for agronomical decision making and discusses its use in allowing for the cognitive participation of those "being developed' ' in the agricultural development planning process.

Basin agriculture is supported by the Indus and the five major rivers of the Punjab, all of which begin in India and flow through Pakistan on their course to the Ara- bian Sea. In 1960, after years of negotiation, the two countries signed the Indus Basin Waters Treaty. This treaty, presently in its final stages of implementation, calls for the cooperative division of Basin water sources, with Pakistan obtaining the water of the three western rivers and India retaining use of the eastern ones (cf. Michel 1967). For Pakistan, a country receiving scanty rainfall, losing farm acreage to salinity and waterlogging, and experiencing rapid population growth, the reduced supply of surface water necessitated some means of enhancing agricultural production.1 The Indus Basin Master Planning Project was organized and funded as an organizational mechanism to meet this goal. In order to increase productivity, its planners, drawn from the government of Pakistan (WAPDA, Ministry of Agriculture), the United Nations (UNDP, IBRD), the United States (AID), and private companies, foundations and universities, empha- sized infrastructural investment and the utilization of the in- puts and technology of the "green revolution.,,2 The success of the latter has depended on Pakistan's farmers to effectively use high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical fertilizers, and new production techniques, to invest in such items as tube- wells, and to be responsive to market constraints and incen- tives (Papenek 1967). 3 While the response to the new agriculture was encouraging to development planners during the late 1960s and early 1970s (cf. Johnson 1979), recent government data (Government of Pakistan 1978) and agricultural economics surveys (e.g., the WAPDA 1977 Agricultural Economics Survey of the Indus Basin) indicated that the use of innovative inputs was leveling off (HYV wheat at 70% of potential, HYV rice at 50% of potential), and in some cases not making much of an impact at all (e.g., chemical fertilizer use among small peasant farmers).4 To advocates of innovation, Pakistani farmers were not behaving as could be expected, given the high benefit-to-cost VOL. 42, NO. 4 WINTER 1983 283</page><page sequence="2">ratio of the new agriculture. For Indus Basin planners respon- sible for formulating accurate projections and viable long-term development strategies, the reasons for this had to be ascer- tained. Theoretical Orientation Throughout the Third World the tendency has been to deem as 4 'irrational' ' those peasant farmers who have failed to re- spond adequately to the new agriculture. The source of this "irrationality" is often taken to be "culture," "local beliefs," "traditional practices," "superstitions," or "general ig- norance," all of which, according to modernization theorists, have to be overcome if development is to occur (cf. Rostow 1960; Schultz 1964; Myrdal 1972). A problem with such a view is that farmer "irrationality" becomes a gloss for a wide vari- ety of behaviors and beliefs that are, in the particular terms of the analyst, not explicable in terms of economic maximization. The result is that "culture," "beliefs," "traditions," etc. become residual categories with no positive or systemic significance for model building. Assessments of the impacts and effects of the green revolu- tion have challenged the notion of peasant "irrationalité' (e.g. Moerman 1968; Popkin 1979; Nair 1979). A most useful position, illustrated by Brokensha et al. (1980) and Hill (1970), suggests that modern agricultural practices based on Western systems of knowledge constitute an alternative to practices based on indigenous systems. Indigenous systems of knowl- edge, though different in content from Western ones, may be quite systematic, coherent, and rational, and are likely to define particular types of skills and abilities as well suited to their application. Analyses of innovation and social change based on the premise that rational knowledge replaces rational knowledge, not ignorance, have yielded impressive results (cf. Kuhn 1962; Wallace 1978). Singer's (1972) exploration of modern indus- trial and traditional Brahminic systems of knowledge in south India and Leslie's (1976) survey of Asian medical systems point to the existential integrity of such knowledge systems as well as the ways they may be synthesized with, compartmental- ized from, or delegitimated by exogenous systems. The use of a knowledge systems approach in social plan- ning, based on the premise that the definition of the situation and information used by participants are relevant for under- standing project outcome, is a relatively recent development in the United States (cf. Forester 1980; Bolan 1980), although it has deep roots in the work of Weberian sociologists, psychol- ogistic economists, and cognitive anthropologists. Interna- tionally, concerns for cognitive participation (cf. Berger 1976) or "appropriate" strategies have been posed as correctives to the impositional qualities of ethnocentric schema that have either ignored or denigrated indigenous resources, specialists, institutions, and knowledge systems. Freire (1970) conducting literacy training in Brazil, Fathy (1972) designing housing in Egypt, and Schumacher (1973) planning village technology in India have all viewed indigenous systems of knowledge as an appropriate resource that can be applied to practical problem solving. Planners knew very little about the indigenous agronomical system of Punjabi farmers and how it was related to inno- vation in the Indus Basin. The study reported on here sought to discover how agricultural production is conceptually orga- nized and how this organization provides a framework within which peasant farmers form purposes, feel motivations, pur- sue intentions, and posit explanations for what they do. Assuming that social action is meaningful and voluntaristic (i.e., negotiated, decisioned) and not merely mechanical, the indigenous agronomy of Pakistani farmers is investigated as a cultural system- a system of symbols and meanings (cf. Schneider 1975). The study does not attempt to either validate or invalidate Punjabi agronomical assumptions and principles, but rather, following the ethnographic applications of cultural analysis (cf. Schneider 1968; Geertz 1973; Marriott and Inden 1977; Silverman 1971; Inden and Nicholas 1977; Varenne 1978), seeks that shared transmitted system of knowledge taken by farmers to represent the "natural" conditions of their lived-in reality. Viewing agronomical knowledge as a system of symbols does not suggest that Punjabi farmers, or any other farmers, are more motivated by the symbolic than the practical. What is suggested is that the farmers' practical- ity, the hard facts of life, and the business of producing food are, from the analyst's (but not the actor's) point of view, sym- bolically constituted (cf. Sahlins 1976). The Setting : Chakpur Chakpur, a village of 1,200 people, is located in Sahiwal District, Punjab. It is one of scores of villages established in the 1930s by British authorities as part of the Sutlej Valley Canal Colony. While the main canal is miles from Chakpur, one of its distribution channels terminates on the village border and presently offers seasonal irrigation to about 300 of the village's 2,600 hectares. Most village land is watered by some two dozen electric- and diesel-powered tubewells in- stalled in the late 1960s. Additional irrigation is offered by animal-powered shallow Persian wells. The main staples in Chakpur are wheat and rice, and the main cash crops, cotton and sugarcane. Surplus grains and cash crops are marketed in nearby mills and processing centers for regional distribution and consumption. One farmer, an absentee landlord owning 120 ha, markets vegetables for ex- port to the Middle East. The largest group in Chakpur is the Nunari, with 104 house- holds. The Nunari obtained their land in the original settle- ment, and while they claim to be descendants of a Rajput chief who converted to Islam some six centuries ago, the Nunari have been farming in the district for at least 100 years (cf. Ib- betson 1974 [1883]:235). More than 60% of the Nunari house- holds own land, with the average holding being 13 ha and the largest nonjoint holding being 77 ha. With one or two excep- tions, the remainder of the Nunari households are dependent on sharecropping and agricultural labor for their livelihood. Chakpur's second largest group is the Bhatti, with 17 house- holds. Though also claiming to be converted Rajputs, Bhattis include a variety of service groups. Nunari landowners engage other Nunari and Bhatti households in a system of barter called seipi in which services provided by contracted share- croppers, carpenters, smiths, porters, barbers, cobblers, etc., are exchanged for traditionally stipulated amounts of harvested produce. 284 HUMAN ORGANIZATION</page><page sequence="3">Chakpur is within a short walking distance of a metalled road on which crops are transported to market. Electricity lines from tubewells power a cotton gin, the village mosque loudspeaker, and its one light bulb. In addition, the village supports an elementary school and is served by hakims (in- digenous physicians) of various levels of training. Most village homes are made of dried mud, but some are of baked brick. No home has either indoor plumbing or a latrine. Several villagers have portable radios, a handful have bicycles, and one has a tractor. The Chakpur i Construction of Agronomical Knowledge Chakpuris have very clear ideas about how crops grow and how various inputs and operations are related to that growth. Such ideas were elicited from discussions with many Chakpuris and through formal intensive interviews with and observation of 15 Nunari farmers over a nine-month period. In seeking in- digenous agronomical variables, relationships, and principles, Chakpuris were first treated as informants and later as respon- dents. Farmers were basically asked why they did the par- ticular things they did and what they thought they were doing. Only after a framework for decision making was revealed were farmers subjected to more rigorous and formalized data collection instruments. This is not a method often used by macrosociologists and economists who rely on survey tech- niques that a priori formulate specific variables and relation- ships and then attempt to reconstitute, as it were, the decision making, through the analysis of statistical correlations of the farmers' responses to questions that may or may not have been relevant to the framework used by the farmer in arriving at his decisions. The Agronomical Domain. In indigenous terms, the pro- cess of crop production is a model of and for other naturalistic processes, most popularly that of the human life cycle. The agricultural operations of (1) readying the seed and soil, (2) planting the seed, (3) raising and tending the crop, and (4) harvesting the produce are spoken of as analogs to stages of human life, that is, (1) conception, (2) birth, (3) nurturance and maturation, and (4) death. Similarly, units within both the agricultural and human domains are metaphorically related. Equations are made between seed and sperm, soil and womb (e.g., bii-zamiin ), irrigation water and mother's milk, and fer- tilizer and food. This is carried into the realm of actions, so that anthropomorphized crops and soils may "eat" fertilizer, "drink" water, "struggle," "feel discomfort," and even become "intoxicated." As with descent in the human domain, species (nasi) con- tinuity is "patrilineal" and provided through the seed. While the seeds of a species all strive toward the same nature, in- dividual variation is thought to occur as a direct result of the effects exerted by contact objects (e.g., soil, water, fertilizer) on a particular crop. As human persons are said to develop specific characteristics through the manipulation of diet, residence, and regimen, so too are crops thought to be subject to purposive and directed manipulation. In Chakpur, the characteristics of crops and the dynamics of such manipula- tion are conceived of in terms drawn from classical and folk humoral theory. Humoral Agronomy. The humoral system used by Chakpuri farmers derives from Greco-Arabic sources with Persian and Indian influences.5 In this system, all material ob- jects are composed of varying quantities of earth, air, fire, and water. Associated with these basic elements are qualities or dispositions (mazaaj) described in terms of hot (garm, taa), cold (Thandy sard), dry (xushk), wet (tar, gil lii), and moderate (mot°adil). For Chakpuris these categories refer neither to temperature nor to moisture levels. Rather, as articulated by Shah (1966), an allopathic physician trained in indigenous medical traditions, hot and cold respectively refer to the ex- penditure and conservation of energy and wet and dry to the receptivity and resistance of matter.6 In all animate forms, energy and matter are related through the life process. Initially, life (jaan) in plants, animals, and humans can only exist if sufficient levels of innate heat and wetness occur. As heat is expended, growth and development occur - matter is transformed from more amorphous and mal- leable wetter forms to more rigid drier forms. As heat expendi- ture continues, matter eventually dries, becoming less recep- tive to further development. Life continues until the store of innate energy is completely expended and matter is no longer animated. Hence, say villagers, though some wetness is necessary if heat is to be expended, wetness generally slows heat expenditure, and if it is in excess may "dampen" it com- pletely. Similarly, dryness may accelerate heat expenditure, and if in excess, may cause "burn out," making further development impossible. All life forms share the same general process although the time it takes for different species (nasi) to complete this pro- cess varies (see Figure 1). Species also vary as to their quantities of innate heat and wetness, as well as with regard to how rapidly heat is deployed and how resistant matter becomes. Those species or "breeds" having relatively great stores of innate heat, or deploying their heat rapidly, are said to be of a hot disposition. Those having relatively limited sources of innate heat, or conserving its deployment, are said to be of a cold disposition. Species ex- hibiting neither characteristic in the extreme may be said to be relatively moderate. Parallel criteria are said to underlie judg- ments concerning the relative dryness, wetness, or moderate- Hot X species ' species x. Moderate N.

THE LIFE PROCESS IN THE HUMORAL SYSTEM VOL. 42, NO. 4 WINTER 1983 285</page><page sequence="4">ness of different species with regard to the resistance and receptivity of matter. The natural disposition and process of development of any living thing can be altered by the heating, cooling, drying, wet- ting, and moderating effects ( tasiir ) of contact objects, or in the case of crops, agricultural inputs. The proper realization of the species nature of a crop would require such effects to re- inforce the disposition of that crop at the appropriate stages of the life processes. Inconsistencies - excessive heating or ex- treme cooling, for example- may either accelerate or check the progress of a crop's development. Such effects on plant life may be consciously manipulated by human beings to achieve certain desired results. For the Chakpuri farmer this is what agronomy is all about. Given a particular crop, Chakpuris choose their inputs in such a way as to accord with its disposi- tion or to deviate from it in diverse goal-directed ways. They also consider the effects of such inputs, and of the crop itself, on the soil. In their considerations, farmers attempt to ac- curately assess the species nature of the chosen crop seed in order to predict its normal growth, and then undertake those actions which will allow both the crop and the land to attain desired humoral states. Dispositions of Crops. In human beings blood is seen as the primary bodily constituent and its disposition used as an indicator for that of the body. For plants, Chakpuri farmers generally use the exploitable (i.e., edible) portion of a crop as an indicator of its disposition. The normal dispositions or humoral characteristics of crop species familiar to Chakpuris are given in Table 1. Farmers were asked to judge each crop in terms of both hot-cold and dry- wet properties. Response choices allowed for judgments concerning the degree to which a property was thought to be present. Response choices for both scales were scored for each farmer, summed, and then averaged to arrive at a group judg- ment. These scores were then converted back into ordinal cate- gories consistent with the terminology and procedures of in- digenous physicians and pharmacologists. Hence, the disposi- tions of crops are given in terms of grade distinctions for hot- cold and dry- wet properties; the higher the grade the more ex- treme the characteristic. Farmers had little difficulty in making judgments about the humoral properties of the 45 crops listed in Table 1. Only less than 5% of the time did farmers find themselves unable to make a judgment concerning the hot-cold characteristics of a crop. Inability to judge the dry-wet characteristics was more common, but still well below 10%. These findings indicate that the terms of reference- judgment of crops in terms of humoral properties - are indeed meaningful to Chakpuri farmers. Variation in the judgments of farmers was computed on the basis of scored responses. For 80% of the crops the standard deviation indicated a variation in hot-cold and dry-wet attribu- tions of less than one response choice rank. That variation in judging the disposition of crops is quite small indicates that the humoral system is commonly shared among those interviewed and that they may be using the same criteria for assessing crop disposition. The basis for judgments of crop disposition rests on subjec- tive and objective types of observations. Subjective observa- tions include the way the crop, as a food, affects farmers who eat it. Crops are commonly judged in terms of their effect on bodily humors and attendent human processes of digestion, perspiration, metabolism, and sexuality. In this sense, the farmer's body, and perhaps those of his family, are used as the measuring devices for arriving at attributions of the humoral qualities of the crop. Chakpuris note that such attributions may be faulty. First, the disposition of a food derived from a crop may be different than that of the harvested produce. Refining, grinding, mill- ing, and cooking operations may all affect the disposition of the crop. Second, human humoral configurations are them- selves varied. A food perceived as "cold" by a teenager (who is relatively "hot") may be perceived as "hot" by a sep- tuagenarian (who is relatively "cold"). Although Chakpuri physicians (hakim) conventionally grade objects relative to a youthful disposition, farmers note that differences in the human body limit the reliability of its use as a measure of crop disposition. Farmers tend to put greater stock in the growth pattern of the crop itself as the basis for making humoral attributions. To TABLE 1.

Nine grade distinctions (following indigenous pharmacological practice) for each scale were made at .44 intervals to reconvert average assessments to dispositions given in the table. H4 is the hottest disposition assigned, followed by H3, H2, HI, M (moderate), CI, C2, C3, and the coldest, C4. Similarly, for the dry-wet scale, D4 is the driest disposition and W4 the wettest. 286 HUMAN ORGANIZATION</page><page sequence="5">Chakpuris, a good farmer is one who carefully observes how a crop affects and is affected by its immediate environment. Farmers observe how crops are either adversely or beneficially affected by hot and cold weather, dry spells, rain, and dif- ferent types of soils and fertilizers. Farmers may note the con- dition of trees and brush that surround a field and ascertain the types of weeds that may sprout within a cropped plot of land. Chakpuri farmers do not formally record or quantify these objective observations any more than they do their sub- jective ones. They do, however, specify relevant criteria and formulate generalizations that allow for the interpretation of those observations. As with subjective assessments, farmers recognize problems in attributions of crop dispositions. The same crop may be dif- ferentially judged because its interaction with the environment is perceived at two or more different points along its lifetime. The disposition of a crop as a seedling is different than that when ready for harvest. Second, assessments of a species may not involve comparable units. Subspecies and breeds may vary considerably in their dispositions- as for example HYV and traditional varieties of wheat and rice. Despite multiple factors that may lead to differential assess- ments, Chakpuri farmers exhibit general agreement as to the dispositions of various crops. Furthermore, these attributions seem to be relatively consistent with those made for crop foods by Shah (1966) and Awan (1973), authorities on in- digenous medicine and pharmacology in Pakistan. The simi- larities between village attributions and those made by inde- pendent professional sources indicate not only the likely systematicity of the humoral framework but also its relatively wide geographic and societal distribution. Dispositions of Other Inputs. As with crops, farmers in Chakpur have notions about the hot-cold and dry-wet proper- ties of other inputs. Assessments of the characteristics of those inputs that affect crop growth are commonly made and generally reveal high levels of agreement. Soil. Chakpuris classify soil texture (zamiin) on the basis of clay-sand content and divide soils into those of clay (mehraa), mixed (ghusaa), and sandy (retalii) categories. Numerous distinctions are made by farmers to further specify soil texture. Frequent adjectives prefixed to these category labels include "good" (changii), "weak" (kamzoor), and "powerful" (taq- tii). An alternative taxonomy classifies soil texture as either heavy (baarii), medium (darmiyanii), or light (halkii). The humoral properties of soils are primarily dependent on texture, secondarily dependent on seasonal conditions, and also influenced by contact with crops, irrigation water, and fertilizer. Lighter soils are generally thought to be drier than heavier soils. They are also more seasonally variable, so that while the heaviest of soils might stay fairly close to moderate through the year, lighter soils will exhibit extreme variation - becoming cooler in the winter (haarii) and hotter in the sum- mer (saunii). The humoral properties as determined by farmer responses (following the procedure described for crops) for the cold season (September to February) are heavy soil, CIDI; medium soil, C3D3; and light soil, C4D4. In the hot season (March to August) the disposition of heavy soil is H IDI, of medium soil, H3D3, and of light soil, H4D4. Heavier soils are said to be more fertile and possess more "power" - often attributed to moderate wetness. In this view, the land is powerful when it has a great deal of potential energy, but expends that energy in a slow or dampened man- ner. Water. For Chakpuris, canals, tube wells, shallow wells, and rain provide water for irrigation. Coolness and wetness seem to be equated with heaviness; heat and dryness with lightness. For Chakpuri farmers, canal and shallow well water tend to be judged as heavier than tubewell and rain water. As with soils, heaviness is said to be indicative of power and fertility. Farmers explain that canal and shallow well water have a high content of soil, manure, minerals, and organic matter, while rain and tube well water are light, purer, and cleaner. Water from various sources is subject to seasonal changes that alter its humoral properties. According to farmers, canal water is MW2 during the summer and C2W3 during the winter. Tubewell water is thought to be relatively cooler (H1D1) during the summer than during the winter (H2D1) because the lower levels of the land are thought to retain the winter's cold. Rainwater is judged to be H1W2 during the hot season and CIDI during the cold season. The water from shallow wells is accorded the humoral properties MW2 during the summer and C2W3 in the winter. Fertilizer. Bovine manure, a traditional fertilizer, is relatively cool and wet (C1M). Although Chakpuris were not asked about other types of organic fertilizers, there is evidence that other organic fertilizers are also accorded humoral dispositions (cf. Government of India 1904:89). Chakpuri farmers also use chemical fertilizers and have little trouble in discerning their properties with high levels of agree- ment. All chemical fertilizers used in Chakpur are thought to be hot and dry. To allow for the verbal judgments of farmers (e.g., "very very hot") and so as to adequately represent the significant differences in the heat and dryness levels of fer- tilizers apparent to Chakpuris, the hot-cold and dry-wet scales were expanded to include the scoring of responses indicating extreme attributions. Urea, the hottest aiïd driest fertilizer, is judged to be H6D6, ammonium sulphate and superphos- phate, H4D4, nitrophosphate, H3D4 and DAP H2D2. Agronomic Production Concepts. From the indigenous agronomical perspective, sound farming entails choosing in- puts that will not create adverse conditions of heat, cold, dryness, or wetness for a given crop. Similarly, such inputs, in- cluding crop-seed, may be chosen so as not to adversely affect the land on which Nunaris continually depend for their liveli- hood. Crops generally require inputs that do not, as farmers say, "fight," "war," or "struggle" (laRaaii) with their species nature. Moderately cool crops, for example, should not be ex- posed to very hot inputs or to extremely cool ones. Rather, say Chakpuris, inputs should either conform to the species nature or deviate from it in relatively moderate ways. This notion of inconsistency is expressed in anthropo- morphic terms by Nunari farmers. Crops and soil may "eat fertilizer" and "drink water," but sometimes they may "not get enough." The fertilizer and water they do receive may cause problems with "digestion" and may still leave the soil and crop "hungry" or "thirsty." A crop may become "intoxi- cated" (nashaa) by a fertilizer, as in the case of being exposed VOL. 42, NO. 4 WINTER 1983 287</page><page sequence="6">to overly hot chemicals. Crops whose 4 'thirst" is not quenched may remain dry and "unhappy," or may 4 'burn up." Inputs that do not "satisfy" the crop may "confuse" it by creating situations it is "not used to." Farmers distinguish several types of crop growth situations. "Correct," "balanced," or "moderate" growth is achieved when a crop is exposed to inputs that accord with its species nature. When inputs are much hotter than normal, they spur energy expenditure, creating a situation of "rapid" or "expan- sive" hyperactive growth. When inputs are abnormally cool, limited or hypoactive growth results. Chakpuris note that dry inputs tend to accelerate the effects of hot inputs, that is, hyperactivity, while wetter inputs tend to retard their effect. The pursuit of various types of growth strategies bears on soil fertility. As soil fertility is associated with wetness and coolness, Chakpuri farmers note the importance of choosing inputs that do not excessively dry the land. Soil "tiredness," "weakness," or depletion occurs when inputs excessively dry the soil. Conversely, soil fertility is "strengthened," or en- hanced, when inputs increase the wetness of the land (but not to such an extreme as to result in waterlogging). Soil fertility is maintained when neither excessive conditions of wetness nor of dryness occur. Consistent with the often cited phrase, "what- ever is hot will dry out, whatever is cool will stay wet," heat tends to promote soil depletion and coolness tends to retard it. Concerns for crop output and soil fertility may often be at odds. Crop hyperactivity, if not extreme, may mean both higher yields and soil depletion; crop hypoactivity, smaller yields and soil enhancement. Crucial for Chakpuri farmers is the ability to recognize production interactions of inputs, to choose in- puts that accord with goals, and to avoid pathological humoral states that can be harmful to either or both crop and soil. Input Production Relations. When asked to specify how they produce various crops (i.e., wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane), Chakpuris include what they take to be relevant inputs and appropriate measures. Planting is described on the basis of area - a kilaa (1 acre) or do kanala (a 40-yard-square plot). Irrigation water is quantified on the basis of the number of floodings or inundations of a plot of land. Chemical fer- tilizer usage is described in bags (100 kg) or half-bags, and manure usage in terms of tralliis or cart loads, (approx. 1,400 kg). The amount of time from sowing to harvest is described in months, and yields in maunds (37.3 kg). The disposition of the crop output is taken to be a function of the humoral properties of the different quantities of the various inputs. Crop yield, described in quantitative terms, is said to be a function of this disposition. According to Chak- puris, the disposition of a crop output may be reached in a variety of ways. The way in which the final dispositional state is reached, as well as the state itself, gives an indication of the yield. For example, a humoral state may be achieved by inputs all consistent with the species nature of the crop, or it may be reached through a mix of very extreme inputs that offset or balance each other. Farmers find that certain crops (e.g., wheat) "enjoy" and "prosper" in situations of "comfort" or limited humoral dynamism, while other crops (e.g., tobacco) are better suited to intensive struggle. Hence, yields are thought to vary among particular crop outputs even though they may have the same final or resultant dispositional states. Soil output, also a function of the production mix, is often described in humoral anthropomorphic terms. Chakpuri farmers do not quantify soil output in any way that would be analogous to crop yield, although soils too are said to ex- perience various types of "struggle." The interrelationships between inputs and output situations with regard to crop growth and soil fertility are expressed through various "rules of thumb" applied by Chakpuri farmers. In cold season production, Chakpuri farmers note several principles for combining inputs if balanced crop growth and soil fertility are to be preserved: 1. As soil texture becomes lighter, and therefore cooler, a hotter fertilizer input is called for. 2. As soil texture becomes lighter it also becomes drier. Hence an increased (wetter) water input is required. 3. As the fertilizer input becomes hotter and drier, addi- tional increases in water input (cooler and wetter) are needed. 4. More tubewell water than canal or shallow well water is needed if the soil and crop are to be cooled and wetted ade- quately. The relationship between variation in the humoral disposi- tions of inputs and perceived crop and soil output states is il- lustrated in Figure 2 for the production of winter wheat. Traditional wheat may be optimally produced, according to Nunaris, by sowing it in heavy soil, using manure and canal water. Such is said to assure balanced growth and soil fertility maintenance. Because of a variety of situational factors, Chakpuris sometimes plant in lighter soils. They note that lighter soils will exert cooler and drier effects on the crop than usually preferred. To overcome the effect of the added cool- ness, farmers indicate the need for relatively hotter fertilizer inputs, that is, to use chemical fertilizers instead of manure. To overcome the effect of the accentuated dryness of both the soil and chemical fertilizer, additional cooler and wetter water is called for. Since tubewell water is not as effective a cooling and wetting agent as canal and shallow well water, relatively more floodings are needed if it is to perform its function. The relationships depicted in Figure 2 have, according to Nunaris, direct bearing on crop and soil outputs. Farmers may I ix "&gt;C/. %f 1 _ vx "&gt;C/.

For example, traditional wheat may be grown in heavy soil with the use of urea. To farmers, it takes only two or three bags of urea (when not offset by an increased water input) to create a situation for hyperactive crop growth. In such a situa- tion, farmers suggested that yield would be quite abundant- greater than in a ' 'balanced' ' growth situation - but the soil would be depleted of its fertility due to the adverse heat and dryness generated by the chemical fertilizer. Inversely, lacking chemical fertilizer, a farmer might have to use manure to fertilize his wheat crop in light soil. In such situations, say Chakpuris, the manure will not provide the amount of heat necessary to spur crop growth. Or as several farmers put it, "the sand will completely eat the manure and still be hungry." Hypoactivity is thus expected - yields will be low, but the soil will be enhanced by the effect of the wet manure. The systematicity of these principles was tested by eliciting the responses of 15 farmers to specific production situations. Farmers were asked to decide what quantities of three types of fertilizer - manure, DAP, and urea - would be appropriate to produce a balanced crop of wheat and maintain soil fertility in heavy, medium, and light soils. Farmers were then asked to judge how many floodings of canal water and tubewell water would be needed for each specified situation. The results, given in Table 2, indicate the means for the various responses. Individual and group attributions concerning production situations accord consistently with explicitly stated principles of humoral agronomic relationships. Since urea is a hotter and drier fertilizer than DAP, somewhat lesser amounts are needed to cause the same humoral effect. Greater amounts of water are seen to be necessary to offset the increasing dryness of soil as it becomes lighter in texture, and the increasing dryness (and heat) of the chemical fertilizer. More tubewell water than canal water is consistently deemed necessary to do this. The application of these principles is evidenced in actual production situations- that of HYV wheat, for example, which is grown in a wide enough variety of soil textures to allow for comparative analysis. Fifteen plots of land on which HYV wheat was about to be harvested were considered. Details of the production situation were elicited from the farmers of those plots of land, and are indicated in Table 3. Patterns of humoral relationships seem to hold for actual production situations involving HYV wheat. As soil texture lightens, greater quantities of hotter and drier fertilizers are used. Concomitant with this, water inputs are increased. Although Nunari farm production may tend toward situations of balanced growth and soil fertility maintenance, yield estimates for the different production mixes indicate that for farmers "too much struggle" is not good for wheat, reducing the quantity of crop output. That is, growing the moderately hot and dry HYV wheat in a very dry light soil using extremely dry fertilizer (urea) results in too much struggle for the crop output to be abundant. Hot season production principles follow those of the cool season save for one major difference. During the hot season soils are hot, not cold, and the lighter the soil texture the hotter the soil. Hence, during the hot season "there is no advantage in using chemical fertilizers on hotter and drier soils." Such use would "burn out" or "exhaust" the soil and, according to farmers, call for inordinate amounts of manure and water in order to temper the soil and preserve its fertility. Thus in the hot season it is ««necessary to apply increasingly hotter and drier fertilizer inputs to increasingly lighter soil. Increased cooler and wetter water inputs for lighter soils would be ex- pected. And if more chemical fertilizer were to be used, even greater amounts of water would be required. This pattern of relationships is ilustrated in the hot season production of rice. Farmers were questioned on the details of their HYV rice production after the rice harvest. The results for various production mixes arranged by soil type are given in Table 4. TABLE 3.

In accord with humoral agronomic principles, there is a pat- tern of increasing water usage as soil texture lightens. Unlike the case for the use of chemical fertilizer and manure with wheat, there does not seem to be a distinct pattern of overall fertilizer usage with rice, nor a correlation of particular fer- tilizers with soil texture types. Noteworthy, however, is the covariance of urea and manure use, indicating perhaps the at- tempt to temper hot and dry crop nutriment with cool and wet fertilizer in order to avoid what are perceived as the dangers of "burn out" in hot season soils. Investigation of cotton and sugarcane production reveals similar patterns of interacting humoral relationships to those specified for wheat and rice production. In questioning farmers about their reasons for altering inputs the way they do, they are quite explicit about such principles- citing them as obvious, generally known, "natural" conditions of farm- ing. Hot and Cold Agriculture Traditional wheat and rice are both cooler and wetter than improved high-yielding varieties. Traditionally used manure is cooler and wetter than newer chemical fertilizers. Water from more traditional sources- shallow wells and canals - offers cooler and wetter effects than that from more modern tube- wells. Differences between what might be termed the cool- wet and hot-dry forms of agriculture are apparent in the optimal productipn recipes of traditional and HYV wheat and rice as elicited from Chakpuri farmers. The modal recipes for the production of traditional and improved staples are given in Tables 5 and 6. Comparison of the production recipes for traditional and HYV staples reveals a cooler and wetter production mix for the former and a hotter and drier mix for the latter. The pro- duction of traditional staples tends toward hypoactive growth resulting in lower yields, as farmers readily acknowledge, but such production is also perceived as resulting in the main- tenance, and even enhancement, of soil fertility. The produc- tion of HYV staples tends toward hyperactivity, allowing for far greater yields, but also soil fertility depletion. Chakpuris see advantages and disadvantages in both the cool and hot agriculture. The advantages of producing tradi- tional varieties of staples are lack of risk, the soil fertilizing function, and their perceived nutritional values. Cool agricul- ture is viewed as stable, nondynamic, nonhyperenergized, and TABLE 5.

Very little can go wrong, according to Nunaris, in traditional staple production mixes of this type. The seed and the cool-wet inputs associated with traditional production provide power and strength to the soil, supposedly performing therapeutic functions. In fact, Chakpuri farmers find applications of manure, cooler and wetter seeds, and cool-wet water to be advantageous in nursing back saline soils subjected to the debilitating effects of excessive heat and dryness. In addition, Chakpuri farmers and their wives argue that traditional wheat and rice are long-lasting energy givers - they are relatively cool and wet - providing nutritional power or strength over long periods of time. Several farmers claimed that in "the old days," they had to partake of only two meals a day, if made from these staples. "Nowadays," several lament, three meals a day are required as the new HYV staples do not have the long-lasting power of the traditional varieties. Consistent with this view of the humoral properties of foods made from traditional and HYV grains, housewives note that the new grains are hard to work with. Dough made from HYV wheat is seen as relatively less malleable (drier) and as requir- ing more kneading. HYV wheat bread is thought to be more apt to burn when cooking. Additionally, Chakpuris note that bread and rice made from traditional grains do not dry out as fast as that from HYV grains, and hence may be reheated for eating as 4 'leftovers' ' without adverse effects or loss of taste. Flat breads made from HYV grain are often judged to be in- capable of being reheated, and are broken up and commonly fed to birds and other animals on the morning after their preparation. Finally, foods made from traditional grain are commonly said to be tastier than those made from HYV grains. In contrast to traditional grain production, the use of newer hotter and drier inputs to produce hotter and drier improved wheat and rice involves greater dynamism. Accordingly, Chak- puri farmers claim that HYV grains mature much faster than traditional ones - wheat one month faster, rice about two weeks faster. While the HYV grains are apt to result in greater output in terms of quantity, they are thought to be more risky to produce because of the agronomical potency that goes into their production. There are "more chances of error,' ' accord- ing to Chakpuris, as miscalculations in assessing input inter- actions can result in crop "burn out." The growing of hotter and drier crops is thought to deplete the soil's fertility. The use of chemical fertilizers is said to pro- vide quick, intensive energy (heat) to the soil, which spurs pro- duction, but over the long run may wear out the earth "like a woman who becomes old before her time as a result of having too many children." In order to prevent such "burn out" as a result of chemical fertilizer "intoxication," Chakpuri farmers speak of and act to temper the fertilizer input. This is done by several means: (1) restricting the use of chemical fertilizer, (2) mixing chemical fertilizer use with manure application, and (3) using additional water. In attempting to temper the effects of chemical fer- tilizer, farmers face several problems. Large quantities of manure may not be available. Additional water costs money. Even if additional floodings are arranged, more problems may result. For example, Chakpuris say that floodings mean more standing water, and hence more insect pests. In order to com- bat such insects, farmers must spray with pesticide. But, for Chakpuris, pesticide is accorded an extremely hot and dry disposition: "A can [ister] of pesticide is equal to one bag of urea." Hence crops and land become even hotter and drier as a result of the pesticide input. Therefore, say farmers, it is then necessary to add more water to cool and temper the crop, but this results in greater quantities of standing water and more pests. Hotter inputs do, however, offer some advantages as Chak- VOL. 42, NO. 4 WINTER 1983 291</page><page sequence="10">puris see it. The greater yields of HYV wheat and rice offer Nunaris more grain for market as well as for intravillage seipi exchanges. Chemical fertilizer opens up lighter cold season soils for cultivation and to some degree can substitute for manure when the latter is in short supply. And tubewell water makes available irrigation to land that otherwise would not have it. The hot agriculture is more energy and investment intensive, and as one farmer put it, the 4 'new agriculture is like fire," ex- pansive, dynamic, and risky. It is oriented toward hyper- activity and crop output. The cold agriculture is more conser- vative, both agronomically and economically. It is more stable and more oriented toward soil conservation. There are specific local conditions in Chakpur that would seem to promote such conservatism. Chakpur has a predominance of sandy soils- even those considered heavy are relatively sandy compared to other regions. Chakpuris also are heavily dependent on tube- wells for irrigation. Furthermore, Chakpuris continue to have an adequate supply of firewood to fuel their hearths, and hence make full use of bovine manure as a fertilizer. Though they are sensitive to the perceived dangers of the hot agricul- ture, Nunaris do not see themselves as resisting it. Rather, they view its advantages and disadvantages in the context of their own agronomical framework and seek to exploit what seems to be beneficial. Chemical fertilizers, new HYV seeds, tube well water, and pesticide are all accorded humoral dispositions, and their generally hot and dry properties provide a means by which they are conceptually accommodated, assessed, and utilized in purposive ways. In Chakpur those ways indicate a temperance of the new by the old, the hot-dry agriculture by the cold- wet agriculture. Quite importantly for Chakpuris, the temperance involves the offsetting concerns of crop output and soil fertility. The farmers who served as informants in this study were a relative- ly homogeneous group of small landowners, hence it is not possible to compare how landowners would compare to tenant farmers with regard to the prioritization or means of dealing with these concerns. Similarly, none of the farmers in Chakpur are at just a subsistence level of production, hence the pressures for short-term crop production may not supersede more long-term interest in soil fertility. Implications While farmer production strategies may differ and nor- mative orientations diverge, they do so in terms of a concep- tual framework defined in terms of the indigenous agronomy. This cultural system is not predictive in itself, although predic- tions may be generated in its terms. Farmers may pursue a wide variety of actions that make sense (to them) in terms of the meanings and relationships defined by this system. Attractive to Indus Basin Project planners aware of this was the idea that attempts at innovation could be designed in con- cert with the indigenous agronomy to the extent that such in- novation required the understanding by and participation of Pakistani peasant farmers. Lacking comparative studies, it is difficult to generalize beyond the Chakpuri data. Yet, given the statements of Pakistani agronomists and another anthro- pologist associated with the project, the Chakpuri case is not atypical, and served to indicate several ways in which the in- digenous agronomy may be utilized for development purposes. Given the findings, new strains of HYV seeds that are per- ceived as being cooler and wetter in effect might be expected to have greater adoption rates than those currently available. Similarly, the development of chemical fertilizers that may, in indigenous terms, cool and wet the soil might be expected to have greater and more popular impact than those hot and dry fertilizers currently available, especially for summer crop pro- duction. And water resource development might, if the Chakpuri case is any indication, more popularly succeed if tubewell water was perhaps channeled through canals or distys in order to pick up the coolness and wetness that would give it ' 'power." The availability of such powerful water to temper hotter and drier inputs might stimulate the use of both HYV seeds and chemical fertilizers. In short, programs may be ra- tionally developed so as to allow for the promulgation of in- novations in a form and substance that accord with the mean- ings farmers attribute to their activities. While institutional participation in the master planning pro- cess was unlikely for relatively poor illiterate peasant farmers, consideration of their agronomy could at least achieve some level of cognitive participation. Ignoring or dismissing the reality of farmers being planned for does not aid in the forma- tion of decision-making models that attempt to understand agricultural behavior. The economic planners on the project thought it advantageous to take into consideration the infor- mation systems of farmers and the terms of their agronomy in order to construct models and programs that account for the motivation, intention, and goal-directed purposes of those in- volved. In short, the indigenous agronomy offered a frame- work for the analysis of decision making that could be ar- ticulated with other systems bearing on farmer behavior. Predictions about use and marketing patterns of fertilizer in relation to soil type could be made in the terms of the in- digenous agronomy. Analyses of market incentives and re- straints could be made in relation to shifting production strategies cast in terms of the humoral agriculture. The use of the humoral agronomy as an indigenous system of knowledge also had consequences for agricultural extension programs. To Chakpuri farmers, extension workers spoke a strange language- the language of Western biochemistry - that was meaningless in the context of the humoral agronomy. Several incidents in Chakpuri indicated that Nunaris thought extension workers and scientists ignorant about the "facts of nature." Chakpuris recognized such persons as powerful, but not necessarily knowledgeable. Perhaps, as has been the case with pharmacology in Pakistan (Said 1969), syntheses of in- digenous and exogenous agronomical models are possible. If such is to be the case, extension personnel may be able to bet- ter communicate if they know the language of the farmer, understand his agronomy, listen, and disseminate knowledge in its terms. Finally, cultural anthropology has a role to play in such ef- forts by investigating systems of meaning - such as the Chakpuri agronomy - that bear on development issues. The analysis of such cultural systems as systems of symbols and meanings would appear to be a particular contribution of the anthropologist, one that would not normally be made by any other social scientist. Such investigations, unlike perhaps those made by natural or applied scientists, are not made for the purposes of either validating or invalidating indigenous knowl- 292 HUMAN ORGANIZATION</page><page sequence="11">edge systems. Rather, the cultural anthropologist aims at elucidating the shared understandings by which members of a society act. Anthropologists have been relatively successful in doing this for systems of ritual (e.g., Turner 1969), mythology (e.g., Lévi-Strauss 1969), kinship (e.g., Schneider 1968), and state drama (e.g., Geertz 1981). In this case, such an attempt is directed toward understanding the cultural construction of the more mundane but no less symbolic domain of agronomy. That agricultural activities are symbolically constituted does not rule out economic, political, demographic, and other forms of analysis; to the contrary, it requires them, for a cultural understanding of any phenomenon is not the only goal of its investigation. Yet it is a unique form of analysis that cultural anthropologists have to offer, and it is one that con- cerns how action makes sense to those who engage in it - whether that action be worshipping a spirit or growing a plant. An anthropology of development that reduces "culture" to the mechanical reflection of "actual," "real," or "practical" behavior does so at the risk of both promulgating ethnocen- trism and denying one of the more important concepts that an- thropology can uniquely claim as its own. NOTES 1 Pakistan's population grew from 47 million in 1961, to 62 million in 1971, to an estimated 84 million in 1981, representing average an- nual increases of approximately 3.2%. At the same time, loss of sur- face water due to the Indus Waters treaty accounted for 32 thousand million m^ or about 16% of Pakistan's available surface supply. Average rainfall is mainly in the 100-600-mm range in the Basin, and offers an undependable irrigation supply. In addition, fully 46% of canal command area suffers the effects of waterlogging and 64%, the effects of salinity (cf. Johnson 1979:14, 53, 75, 88; Government of Pakistan 1978:5). 2 Prior to the green revolution era Pakistan's outlays for agricul- tural development were relatively small, representing 6% to 7% of the budgets of the six-year (1950-56) plan and the first five-year plan (1955-60). The proportion of funds for agriculture doubled in the sec- ond (1960-65) and third (1965-70) five-year plans. Expenditures for infrastructural development - water, power, transportation, and com- munication-have remained relatively high at between 35% and 45% of budget. While total funds for agricultural and infrastructural development continued to increase in absolute amounts through the 1970s, the percentage of funds devoted to agriculture had declined to between 8% and 10% by the end of the decade (cf. Johnson 1979: 42-45; Akhtar 1976:326-342). 3 The emphasis in agricultural development expenditures has been on government subsidies for the use of modern innovations, par- ticularly chemical fertilizer. In 1976, for example, subsidies for the purchase of chemical fertilizer accounted for almost half of an agricultural budget of 770 million rupees. Almost 23% was budgeted for plant protection and 7% to storage facilities. Less than 4% was devoted to research and less than 3% to enhance agricultural credit funds. Seed development is included in the research budget and tube- well subsidies in the water budget. Funding for agricultural extension activities was miniscule (cf. Akhtar 1976:335-342). 4 Advances from 1965-66 to 1972-73 in the adoption of HYV seeds, use of fertilizer, and overall productivity of staples were much more dramatic than in the ensuing seven-year period. Quite revealing is the lack of change in the yield of HYV crops themselves since the mid-1960s. Average yields of HYV rice (at 1,950 kg/ha) and HYV wheat (at 1,650 kg /ha) have remained relatively stable since they were first introduced (cf. Government of Pakistan 1978, 1972). 5 In Pakistan most writers on the humoral system regard Ibn Cinna (Avicenna) as its master, and his book, the Qanoon [Canon] of Medicine , as its text. Both English (e.g., Shah 1966) and Urdu (e.g., Qarshi 1974) commentaries refer to Roman (Galenic) and Greek (Hip- pocratic, Ionian) sources. There are linkages with Ayurvedic systems of medical diagnosis and pharmacological treatment (cf. Said 1969; Leslie 1976). The nonmedical application of humoral theory in south Asia is evidenced in the fields of magic, astrology and exorcism (Shur- reef 1973), metallurgy (Mahdihassan 1976), and political sociology (Fazl 1975). Further afield, humoral theory was applied to architec- ture by Persians (cf. Ardalan 1973) and to anthropology by Europeans (cf. Kant 1974). Foster (1967) and others have reported its use in Latin America, and atomized vestiges continue in American folk usage. 6 Pakistani and Western physicians have suggested various cor- relates of humoral properties in terms of Western biology, chemistry, and physics. In one view, heat is regarded as a substance, akin to the medieval European notion of caloric. Of ten allopathically trained physicians in Karachi, six identified cholesterol as the heat substance, and two suggested a form of distilled semen. Other general views associate hot with protein, wet with the presence of fats and oils, dry with their absence, and cold with citrus fruits and green vegetables. Siddiqui (1969) associates nitrogen-based alkaloids with heat and dry- ness, sulphur compounds with heat and carboxyls, and terpanics with coolness. The interpretation adopted here is more consistent with Chakpuri discourse and is closer perhaps to notions of energy and matter in Western physics. As such, the calorie, as a unit of energy ex- penditure, is also somewhat associated with heat levels in the humoral system. Humoral properties are not generally associated with temperature. An ice cube, for example, is commonly said to be hot. Nor should humoral heat be confused with the "heat" of spiciness. The hot spices used as a popular seasoning mixture in south Asian cuisine are con- sidered hot because of their humoral properties, not because of their spiciness.
