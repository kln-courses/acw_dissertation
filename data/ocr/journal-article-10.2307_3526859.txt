<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shai Held THE PROMISE AND PERIL OF JEWISH BARTHIANISM: THE THEOLOGY OF MICHAEL WYSCHOGROD* Michael Wyschogrod is Maimonides' worst nightmare. For the medieval philosopher and legist, the unity and incorporeality of God, estab- lished incontrovertibly by philosophy, are foundations of the Jewish faith. Not surprisingly, then, The Guide of the Perplexed opens with an extended attempt to undermine the initial impression created by scripture-that God has a physical reality and is given to a range of intense and dramatic emotions. To believe this about God-in other words, to read the Bible literally-is, for Maimonides, to be guilty not merely of wrongheadedness but also of out-and-out idolatry. Idolatry can be avoided only by reading scripture through the lens of philo- sophical metaphysics. Wyschogrod will have none of this. To suggest that the God of Israel is somehow equivalent to the God of metaphysical speculation is to commit a crime against scripture and authentic Jewish thinking. The God of Israel is a "specific person . . . [who] . . . does not hesitate to assume a proper name" (p. 40), and the Bible itself "does not hesi- tate to speak of him in personal and anthropomorphic terms" (p. 42). The Bible shares none of Maimonides' discomfort with divine corpo- reality and mutability; only "improperly understood" can the God of Abraham be turned into some kind of"metaphysical Absolute" (p. 30). Maimonides is thus a kind of tragic figure for Wyschogrod, a Jewish thinker who "stakes his Judaism" on a set of philosophical concerns entirely alien to the heart of Jewish theology. All of Maimonides' tor- tured theologizing leaves us, according to Wyschogrod, with little more than "an overly rarefied God who is so beyond all conception that he cannot be distinguished from no god at all" (p. 177). The divide between the two theological projects could not be more stark. For Maimonides, to speak of God in biblical terms unrefined by philosophical reflection is to flirt with idolatry; for Wyschogrod, to *Michael Wyschogrod, Abraham's Promise: Judaism and Jewish-Christian Relations, ed. with an introduction by R.

Wyschogrod is this generation's most eloquent and emphatic critic of Maimonides; he is at his most compelling in insisting upon the irreducible tension between scrip- tural, covenantal monotheism, on the one hand, and abstract, philo- sophical monotheism, on the other. No amount of creative (i.e., destructive) Maimonidean exegesis, Wyschogrod insists, will ever be able to bridge the unbridgeable divide between philosophy's God and revelation's. Thus, for example, Wyschogrod demonstrates quite con- vincingly that the Shema is not a philosophical formulation of God's metaphysical oneness but, rather, an impassioned declaration of cove- nantal fidelity-"Adonai Echad" means not that "God is one" in His inner nature but that "God alone" is to be worshiped. If philosophical monotheism is concerned with abstract truths about a transcendent deity, its scriptural counterpart is concerned with the concrete interac- tions of a personal God and His people. Wyschogrod's theology is fundamentally a theology of election. The God of Israel has "fallen in love" with Abraham and elected his seed as his own nation, seared his covenant into their flesh, and given them an array of commandments that they must obey. God loves and seeks to redeem all of humanity, but Israel is God's favorite child, and God "loves it as no other, unto the end of time" (p. 28). The nations are understandably jealous of Israel's status, but they must learn to accept it and to discover that "non-election does not equal rejection" (p. 172); Israel, in turn, must learn that election is intended as the basis not for vain pride but for universal responsibility, since, as God tells Abraham in their very first encounter, all the nations of the earth must receive blessing through him (Gen 12:3). Israel can disobey God's word but only with "the most disastrous consequences" (p. 26), both for itself and for the larger world. Israel's God is a God of love but also a God of wrath, and though love will ultimately win out over wrath, in this world Israel can be-and indeed has been-punished with dramatic severity for its iniquities. Wyschogrod readily admits that from the perspective of "human religious consciousness" there is much here that is very troubling. Why is divine election a function of birth rather than of "religious sen- sibility"? Why, in other words, does God choose a family rather than a church? Isn't a robust theology of election blatantly chauvinistic and "inexcusably arrogant" (p. 26)? Wyschogrod responds that indeed it would be, "were it the self-election of a people. As it is, it is a sign of God's absolute sovereignty which is not bound by human concep- tions" (p. 26). In other words, from a human perspective, Israel's elec- tion is quite disturbing. But what we have in scripture, according to Wyschogrod, is not a human but a divine perspective. The task of the</page><page sequence="3">318 ShaiHeld Jewish theologian is neither to dilute the biblical proclamation nor to subject it to human moral standards; the Jewish theologian must unapologetically affirm the absolute, unconditioned freedom of God and the choices God makes. Israel (and, as we shall see, the entire world) must accept God's decision in love and obedience. To the theologically educated reader, the echoes of Karl Barth should not be difficult to hear. For the giant of twentieth-century Protestant theology, a true encounter with the Bible reveals truths both strange and unexpected. The truths of revelation are not avail- able elsewhere and certainly not through purely human philosophical reflection: "We have found in the Bible a new world, God, God's sovereignty, God's glory, God's incomprehensible love. Not the his- tory of man but the history of God! . . . Not human standpoints but the standpoints of God! . . . It is not the right human thoughts about God which form the content of the Bible, but the right divine thoughts about men.'' Barth serves as a kind of mentor-hero for Wyschogrod: the former's consistent emphasis on God's freedom and sovereignty, his unabashed fidelity to scripture and to divine revelation, and his refusal to be cowed or rendered "helpless before the mighty technol- ogy of 'scientific' biblical scholarship" are all models the latter seeks to emulate. Wyschogrod's faith, like Barth's "is not grounded in some alleged eternal verities of reason or on some noble and profound reli- gious sensibility that is shared by all men or by a spiritual elite, but on a movement of God toward man as witnessed in scripture" (pp. 214-215). At core, Wyschogrod tells us, Barthian theology shares a common foundation with Jewish theology-an unwavering commitment to "obedient listening to the Word of God" (p. 216). Wyschogrod's goal, then, is to articulate a Jewish Barthianism, a Jewish theology unremit- tingly committed to the "data" revealed by scripture. But there is ultimately something incongruous about aspiring, as Wyschogrod does, to be both an impassioned Barthian and an Ortho- dox Jew (let alone an Orthodox Jewish thinker). With his relentless focus on scripture and its authority, Barth is perhaps the quintessen- tially Protestant theologian. But contra Wyschogrod, Jewish theology has never been based on a direct encounter with scripture but, rather, on an encounter with scripture as read and interpreted by the Jewish tradition; sola scriptura is, Jewishly speaking, an utterly alien idea. A theology that takes the oral Torah seriously is, in some critical sense, necessarily more Catholic than Protestant-in other words, it takes tradition at least as seriously as it takes scripture. Put differently (and perhaps more traditionally), a Jewish "theology of the Word of God" must emphasize that the Word of God includes both the Written and the Oral Torah and that the former is consistently read in light of the</page><page sequence="4">The Promise and Peril of Jewish Barthianism 319 latter. At some level, Wyschogrod is aware of this, and he periodically gestures toward the Oral Torah or emphasizes its continuities with scripture. But his theology is, almost exclusively, a theology of scrip- ture; it is scripture, and not its rabbinic commentators, that ultimately interests him. This is, to put it simply, Jewishly unorthodox-and, quite obviously, Jewishly un-Orthodox. Wyschogrod's readings of scripture are often striking in their dar- ing and originality, but his work as a whole suffers from a critical lack of methodological reflection. Thus, despite his commitment to biblical theology, Wyschogrod pays no attention at all to the plurality of texts and voices within scripture and offers no guidance as to how a con- temporary theologian might choose or prioritize among them. Thus, for example, Wyschogrod eloquently criticizes right-wing religious Zionism, insisting that "a high degree of nonviolence" is ultimately more important than exercising the Jewish right to live anywhere in biblical Israel: "Nonviolence rather than residence in Hebron," he tells us, "is the deepest layer of messianism" (p. 106). One can share many of Wyschogrod's moral and theological commitments (as I do) and yet still be struck by the lack of hermeneutical thinking here: On what basis does Wyschogrod prioritize peaceful prophetic visions over the genocidal impulses of Deuteronomy? By what criteria does he establish that nonviolence represents a "deeper layer" ofJewish messi- anism than some other, like the restoration of biblical lands to Jewish sovereignty? Of course, one could argue this point either from the weight of Rabbinic tradition-by the time the Rabbis are done with the book of Deuteronomy, parts of it are simply unrecognizable-or from what we might call extrascriptural moral intuitions, but Wyscho- grod has seemingly closed himself off to either avenue. He is, after all, fundamentally a scriptural theologian (in other words, a Protestant rather than a Catholic Jew) who wants to de-emphasize the ways the Rabbis read scripture creatively and even rebelliously, and he expresses repeatedly his concern that secular moral thinking runs the risk of compromising the absolute sovereignty of God and his com- mandments. But despite his protestations to the contrary, I suspect that Wyschogrod's reading of the Jewish tradition is influenced both by Rabbinic tradition and by a basic commitment to moral universal- ism. Wyschogrod is, in some sense, a better theologian than his meth- odology (or lack thereof) would dictate. Like any responsible and creative Jewish thinker, he chooses to prioritize some biblical texts over others, centering some values and ideas while marginalizing oth- ers. Although he claims otherwise, his theology is no mere "obedient listening to scripture"-and it is the better for it.2 Theologians traditionally expend vast quantities of time and effort in exploring the nature of God language-but not Wyschogrod. As a</page><page sequence="5">320 ShaiHeld self-proclaimed Jewish Barthian, Wyschogrod feels no need to pass his theological categories through any sort of philosophical crucible or fil- ter. If the Bible tells us that God is a personal being who cares for all humanity but has "fallen in love" with Abraham and eternally elected his seed, then Wyschogrod will simply affirm these claims without either hesitation or elucidation. If scripture attributes emotion to God, then God is an emotional being; if it tells us that the human being is created in the image of God, then indeed, God's being must have some "physical aspect." More than almost any other contemporary Jewish thinker (David Blumenthal is a possible exception), Wyschogrod is both courageous and relentless in his refusal of what Heschel won- derfully called the "anesthetization" of God. But I wonder whether his uncompromising dichotomization between philosophy and reve- lation leads him, at times, to unnecessary extremes: Are there no alternatives between Wyschogrod's extreme personalism (revelation) and what he regards as the Maimonidean abyss (philosophy)? Does sustained reflection on whom and what we mean when we say "God" necessarily compromise our commitment to affirming the Word of God? Wyschogrod seems to fear that any sustained reflection on the nature and meaning of God language would represent an unaccept- able compromise of his scriptural commitments, when in fact such reflection might well serve to deepen and sophisticate his theological thinking. A rarity among Orthodox Jewish thinkers, Wyschogrod has spent a great deal of his career in theological dialogue with Christians and Christianity.3 Wyschogrod is aware, of course, that many in the Ortho- dox world consider dialogue with Christianity misguided at best and dangerous at worst: "There is perhaps no more efficient method of committing Orthodox Jewish suicide," he writes, "than admitting that any part of my interpretation of Judaism is the result of contact with Christianity" (p. 205). But Wyschogrod is undeterred by this cultural threat. Jews who take seriously God's promise that all of humanity will be blessed through Abraham cannot possibly be "ultimately isolation- ist"; they must "maintain a vital interest in the spiritual life of the nations with whom [they are], in a sense, jointly embarked on the path to redemption." But if the Jewish theologian must therefore take an active interest in the religious life of all humanity, she or he must take particular interest in Christianity, which "has mediated the vocabulary of the God of Israel to all parts of the earth." A Jewish theologian can- not help but perceive that "something wonderful is at work" in the spread of Christianity, "something that must in some way be con- nected with the love of the God of Israel for all his children, Isaac as well as Ishmael, Jacob as well as Esau" (pp. 212-213).4 It will not do simply to dismiss Christian ideas as idolatrous, since Jews are expected</page><page sequence="6">The Promise and Peril of Jewish Barthianism 321 to teach the world the Noachide Laws, which include a prohibition on idolatry: "If I, as a Jew, believe that the Trinity and the Incarnation are false doctrines that either border on or constitute idolatry, then it is my duty as a Jew to persuade my Christian friends to abandon these teachings" (p. 158). Moreover, an engagement with the extraordinar- ily rich tradition of Christian theological reflection can help to deepen Judaism's own theological thinking-provided, Wyschogrod hastens to add, that we are not thereby led to exchange the "scriptural" for the "philosophic." Wyschogrod forcefully dismisses the claim that Jewish theology must reject a priori Christian notions of divine incarnation, "as if the Jewish philosopher can somehow determine ahead of time just what God can or cannot do, what is or is not possible for Him, what His dig- nity does or does not allow." If Judaism denies the incarnation, it is not because there is something intrinsically idolatrous about it but, rather, because Israel "does not hear this story, because the Word of God as it hears it does not tell it and because Jewish faith does not tes- tify to it" (p. 215). But Wyschogrod attempts to narrow the gap between Jewish and Christian theology even further. Scripture reports that God dwells both in a particular place-the Temple and the Tabernacle-and, as a result of God's intense love, amid a particu- lar people-the children of Abraham. Of course, Wyschogrod recog- nizes that there is a crucial distinction between God dwelling in Israel's flesh and God actually becoming flesh," but nevertheless, he insists, "My claim is that the Christian teaching represents an intensifi- cation of the teaching of the in-dwelling of God in Israel by concen- trating that in-dwelling in one Jew rather than leaving it diffused in the people of Israel as a whole" (p. 187). Conversely, Wyschogrod writes that he "detect[s] a certain diluted incarnation" in the Jewish idea of God dwelling in the Temple and the people (p. 177). Wyschogrod is engaged in a delicate theological dance here, seeking to "narrow" the gap between Jewish theology and Christian without "eliminating" it.5 If the Christian idea of divine incarnation is ultimately a theological "mistake" (but note well, a mere "mistake" is a far cry from the sin of idolatry), it is one from which Jewish theology can learn much about its own "incarnational elements." I would quibble with Wyschogrod's less-than-careful use of language-I am not sure how much we gain by referring to God's immanence as "diluted incarnation," and the move from the former to the latter strikes me as more than a mere "intensification"-but the general thrust of his argument is undoubtedly correct: educated Jews should move beyond facile and self-serving dismissals of Christian theology and should be open to the ways in which exposure to Christianity can lead them to rediscover crucial ele- ments of the Jewish tradition. To allow God's love and immanence to</page><page sequence="7">322 ShaiHeld be the sole property of Christian theology, for example, is to perpetu- ate a crime against the very heart of Jewish theology and practice. But if Judaism must be more generous in its understanding of Christianity, Christianity in turn must rethink some of its most cher- ished and deeply held assumptions. First and foremost, Christian the- ology must take seriously Paul's assertion that "the gracious gifts of God and his calling are irrevocable" (Rom 11:29) and realize that "God's election of Israel is not just an historical curiosity but a contem- porary reality." Christianity, in other words, must jettison the idea that the election of Israel has been superseded, "leaving Israel out in the cold" (p. 208). Gentile jealousy over the election of Israel is under- standable, but it must not be allowed to obscure the fact that even after the coming of Jesus, God's covenant with the Jewish people endures. Similarly, Christian theology must reexamine its relationship to Jewish Law. Christianity has often derided Jewish Law as a "potent poison" that bestows guilt, and therefore death, on those who seek to adhere to it. Turning away from the Law and the damage it inflicts, "Christians place their trust in Jesus, and are saved because they know that faith saves and law condemns." But fortunately, another, very dif- ferent approach to the Law can also be found in the New Testament. Wyschogrod goes to great lengths to develop a revisionist reading of Paul, according to which the latter affirms the continuing vitality and validity of Jewish Law for Jews. Acts 15 describes a dispute brought before the Jerusalem church over whether gentile Christians need to be circumcised in order to be saved. Paul argues that circumcision is unnecessary; his opponents disagree. After lengthy debate, Paul's position is vindicated, and the church teaches that the legal burden placed upon gentile Christians should be limited to the Noachide Laws. Wyschogrod places a great deal of stock in his Talmudic read- ing of this story: From the fact that the early church was divided over whether gentile Christians were obligated by the Law, we can deduce that it was clear to everyone involved that Jewish Christians remained so obligated: "The possibility of the Torah not remaining binding for Jews never occurred to anyone in Jerusalem" (p. 194). Paul's negative comments about the Law must now be read in a new light: His goal was "to dissuade gentile Jesus-believers from placing themselves under the obligations of the Torah. Were he writing to Jews, his eval- uation of Torah observance would have been different" (p. 163). Paul was thus, in a sense, continuing the Rabbinic tradition of discouraging potential converts to Judaism; for Paul, the Christ event rendered such conversion superfluous. According to Wyschogrod's Paul, then, the Christ event achieved different ends for Jewish and gentile Christians: The latter are</page><page sequence="8">The Promise and Peril of Jewish Barthianism 323 brought into the house of Israel as "associate members" (p. 191) or "adopted sons and daughters" who are welcomed without needing to undergo circumcision, while the former "are freed from the danger of punishment if they disobey the Torah because God is all mercy now" (p. 197). Christ's coming did "narrow" in very dramatic ways the distinc- tion between Jews and Gentiles, but it did not "erase" it (pp. 189-190). Thus, since God's covenant with Israel has not been superceded, Christians must recognize that the "disappearance of the Jewish peo- ple from the world cannot be an acceptable development." But much more radically, they must encourage Jews who convert to Christianity to resist intermarriage (presumably, Wyschogrod wishes them to marry other Jewish Christians) and thus "to maintain their identity as the seed of Abraham" (p. 197). Further, and still more radically, since "neither Jesus nor Paul taught that any portion of the Law of Moses had become outmoded for Jews" (p. 209), Jewish Christians "must also remain loyal to the Torah and its commandments, with their faith in Jesus Christ as the only characteristic differentiating them from other Jews" (p. 198). Wyschogrod goes so far as to write a letter to Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris, encouraging him, a born Jew who has insisted that "in becoming Christian I did not intend to cease being a Jew" (p. 204), to return to the observance ofJewish Law. Lust- iger's Christian faith, Wyschogrod suggests, requires no less of him. Of course, his best intentions notwithstanding, Wyschogrod leaves himself open to the charge that he has grossly understated what it means for a Jew to convert to Christianity; there is something almost bizarre about describing faith in Christ as "the only characteristic" separating one from mainstream Judaism-this "only" contains a great deal. Apostasy is not merely a sin in Judaism like some other (some of us violate the Sabbath, others worship Christ), it is in many ways the sin. This, then, is Wyschogrod's theology of the Jewish Christian real- ity: God's election of Israel is eternal, but God has made use of Chris- tianity to spread word of Him throughout the globe. Paul sees Christ as opening the house of Israel to Gentiles, a claim that Jews should not dismiss lightly; the reality of Christianity should force Israel to "ask itself how it envisages the relation of the nations to its God" (p. 171). Put even more starkly, it is "particularly important for Judaism to examine what Christ is alleged to have accomplished, even if Judaism maintains its dissent that it is he who has accomplished it" (p. 199). In other words, a particularistic Jewish theology must avoid the tempta- tion to obliterate its universal horizon; if all the nations of the earth are beloved of God, Jews must not deny the possibility that God reaches out toward them as well. There is much about Paul's theology that Jews can and must reject. But "the non-election of the gentiles</page><page sequence="9">3 24 Shai Held cannot be as deep and permanent as Judaism has often assumed. This is," according to Wyschogrod, "the truth of Paul" (p. 200). A chauvin- istic exclusivism is Jewishly-because biblically-unacceptable. Strangely, Wyschogrod rests his reading of Paul on an interpreta- tion of the book of Acts, a New Testament text authored by Luke, rather than on actual Pauline writings. Such an approach to Paul is untenable, since, as Paula Fredriksen has noted, "Luke's Paul, c. 100, and Paul's Paul, c. 50, are two different people," and one cannot reli- ably learn about the latter from the former." Wyschogrod would have been on firmer-though still controversial-ground had he chosen to rely on revisionist readings of Paul's own writings (such as Romans and Galatians), according to which the latter did not regard the Law as obsolete for Jews.' But historical reconstructions of Paul may well be beside the point. In other words, Wyschogrod's reading of Paul may well be historically wrong but theologically right. In his Barthian fervor, Wyschogrod needs his suggestions (prescriptions?) for Christian theology to be firmly grounded in scripture (in this case, obviously, the New Testament). But, contra Wyschogrod, Christianity's ability to reform itself does not rise and fall with divergent interpretations of Paul. Despite Barth and Wyschogrod's claims to the contrary, theol- ogy can learn crucial truths from sources other than scripture, and there will therefore undoubtedly be many Christians who reject supersessionism and anti-Judaism whether or not Paul would have agreed. Such revisions of Christian theology-authentically Pauline or not- are imperative, since, as Wyschogrod puts it, "Jews cannot view with much sympathy a Christianity that adheres to the teaching of contempt for the Torah of Moses" (p. 163). One final note: Wyschogrod is trained in philosophy rather than history, and at times it shows. We have already seen that he implausibly conflates Paul himself with Luke's portrayal of him. Similarly, Wyschogrod's suggestion that Christianity raised Jesus to the status of divine being as a response to Israel's rejection of him as messiah lacks any historical foundation. Third, he fails to reckon with the creativity and originality of Rabbinic Judaism and with its many discontinuities with biblical religion; the claim that the Rabbis were "essentially obedient to the voice of scripture" (p. 227) requires, to put it mildly, some defense and elaboration. Finally, Wyschogrod uses the terms Orthodox and Orthodoxy in astonishingly ahistorical ways. Let one example suffice: Wyschogrod's suggestion that "Paul was, after all, an Orthodox Jew" (p. 234) is at once wildly misleading about Paul and woefully anachronistic about Orthodoxy-just what was orthodox (let alone Orthodox) in first-century Judaism? As Jacob Katz long ago demonstrated, Orthodoxy is a thoroughly mod- ern phenomenon; it seems strange, to put it mildly, for Wyschogrod</page><page sequence="10">The Promise and Peril of Jewish Barthianism 325 to simply retroject it into antiquity-and to describe the father of Christianity no less! As we have seen, there is much in the work of Michael Wyschogrod that is extremely problematic-the ultimately impossible marriage of Judaism and Barthianism, the methodological and hermeneutical naivete, and the utter lack of sophisticated historical thinking. But despite all this, Wyschogrod remains one of the most interesting and theologically pro- vocative Jewish theologians of our time. His unapologetic affirmation of the God of Israel, his dialectical embrace of covenantal particularism and theological universalism, his courageous explorations of the very heart of Christian theology, and his often arresting readings of scripture render him a thinker worth reading and rereading. Our time is not blessed with an abundance of substantive and important Jewish religious thinkers; in Wyschogrod we have one for whom we ought to be most grateful.

It is quite striking, of course, that Wyschogrod's collected essays are being brought to print by a Protestant Christian publishing house (Eerdmans). One has the impression that Wyschogrod has had a much wider readership and has enjoyed a much greater influence among Christians than among Jews. 4. In an important essay unfortunately not included in this collection, Wyschogrod goes so far as to declare: "Basically, I suppose, I am motivated by a feeling that in some sense Christianity is part of Greater Judaism. Christian- ity is not just another faith, as far as Judaism is concerned. . . . Christianity is, in a sense, the Judaism of the Gentiles" (Michael Wyschogrod, "A Jewish Per- spective on Incarnation," Modern Theology, Vol. 12, No. 2 [April 1996], p. 205, pp. 195-209. Here, as often in Wyschogrod's writings, the reader wishes for expansion and elaboration upon a provocative claim: Are Christians part of</page><page sequence="11">326 Shai Held God's covenant with Israel, or are they part of a new, second covenant? How do Wyschogrod's views compare with those of Christian theologians who have struggled with single and double covenant models for understanding Jewish- Christian relations? For a useful summary of recent Christian positions on these questions, see John T. Pawlikowski, "Single or Double Covenant? Con- temporary Perspectives," in Peace, in Deed: Essays in Honor of Harry James Cargas, (ed.) Zev Garber and Richard Libowitz (Atlanta, 1998), pp. 147-162. 5. Wyschogrod's commitment to narrowing the theological gap between Judaism and Christianity without eliminating it is reflected in his approach to the trinity as well: "In the final analysis," he writes, "the Jewish understanding of God is intact as long as no power or structure is posited that is equal to God and that is in a position to oppose successfully the will of God. In spite of all the difficulties Christian trinitarian teaching poses for Judaism, the absence of the theme of conflict among the persons of the trinity maintains trinitarianism as a problem for rather than a complete break with Judaism" (p. 42). Unfortunately, Wyschogrod does not develop or expand upon his fascinating attempt to soften the scandal of trinitarianism for a Judaic understanding of monotheism. It should be noted that Wyschogrod is in some important sense unique among Jewish theologians reflecting on Christianity and Jewish-Christian relations. While other thinkers-Franz Rosenzweig, for example (following, to some extent, Maimonides and Halevi)-will similarly emphasize Christianity's role in bringing the gentile nations to God, they will make no attempt at all to mitigate what they see as Christianity's dilution ofJudaism's core truth. They are thus left with the somewhat paradoxical claim that news of the God of Israel is brought to the nations of the world by a religion that at once propagates and dilutes genu- ine monotheism. As we have seen, Wyschogrod, too, sees trinity and incarnation as "mistakes," but he still works hard to show that these mistakes are less severe than they might appear at first glance. In this latter project, Rosenzweig would surely not have joined him. For the latter's views on Christianity and on its rela- tionship to Judaism, see Leora Batnitzky's seminal essay, "Dialogue as Judgment, Not Mutual Affirmation: A New Look at Franz Rosenzweig's Dialogical Philoso- phy,"Journal of Religion, Vol. 79, No. 4 (October 1999), pp. 523-544. 6.

For such revisionist readings of Paul, see, for starters, Lloyd Gaston, Paul and the Torah (Vancouver, 1987); and, more recently, John Gager, Reinventing Paul (Oxford, 2000). The literature on Paul and the Law is immense and grow- ing. A useful bibliography (covering the years 1980-1994) may be found in James D. G. Dunn, ed., Paul and the Mosaic Law (Grand Rapids, MI, 2001). The approach represented by Gaston, Gager, and others is surely a minority view but nevertheless a defensible one held by respected scholars; the view that Paul's theology can be accurately reconstructed based on the book of Acts, in contrast, is totally implausible and would be rejected by virtually all critical scholars. In general, Wyschogrod seems to lack any real awareness of the find- ings of critical research, either on the Hebrew Bible or on the New Testament.</page></plain_text>
