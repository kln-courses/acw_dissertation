<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LYRIC PLANET: CHAUCER'S CONSTRUCTION OF SUBJECTIVITY IN THE COMPLAINT OF MARS by Carolynn Van Dyke Our understanding of lyric poetry has changed greatly since the days when Ruskin could call it confidently "the expression by the poet of his own feelings."1 The New Critics taught us not to assume that any text expresses its writer's own feelings. From Leo Spitzer and later from Judson Boy ce Allen, we learned also that the medieval lyricist speaks as "a representative of mankind" who achieves "the displace ment of particular self-hood into truth."2 And in a brilliant new book, Gregory Stone virtually inverts Ruskin's formulation: "The courtly love singer cannot appear as anything other than they, a subject with out a name, a plural or collective rather than an individual ego."3 Cogent as they are, those attacks on the association of lyric with individual self-expression leave the genre without clear definition. As Jonathan Arac writes in summarizing a recent collection of essays on lyric poetry, "The most common sense among those who have used the notion [of 'the lyric'] is that lyric expresses pure subjectivity."4 Of the other features often cited, brevity is an accidental feature, and the original association with music has blurred beyond usefulness. When Stone and others deconstruct its first-person subject, they seem to subvert the lyric's own identity as well. I propose not to resolve the conundrum over definition but to enshrine it within the genre. Lyrics are short poems mainly in the first person singular?/, not we or they. On the one hand, therefore, lyrics inevitably evoke biographical particularity. Raymond Oliver notes that even medieval lyrics, which may be impersonal, "must be understood as spoken from a point of view."5 Nearly all of Chaucer's short poems, for instance, use the first person, and even the handful of relatively unlyrical exceptions?The Former Age, Truth, Gentilesse, Lak of Stedfastnesse?betray themselves through tags and exclamations as the reflections of a particular speaker. On the other hand, lyrics counteract the illusion of particularity repeatedly, almost continu THE CHAUCER REVIEW, Vol. 31, No. 2, 1996.

In medieval lyric the / often sounds collective or even univer sal, as Spitzer, Allen, and Stone note, for it governs conventional or authoritative predicates. Comparably though differently, the "appar ently autonomous voice[s]" of more modern lyrics are "haunt[ed] or inhabit[ed]" by "traces of alien voices or texts."6 Originating from an individual subject that it perpetually undermines, lyric discourse is at odds with itself. The tension between unique and general subject balances quite dif ferently in different medieval lyrics. In some religious poems, for instance, a particular subject shines through a timeless paradigm, "annihilating"?to borrow the phrasing of R. W. Frank, Jr., from an other context?"the chasm . . . between individual psyche and moral abstraction."7 In others, a specific observer almost vanishes into ortho dox observations, leaving only a faint, annoying flicker of particularity. Love-lyrics notoriously articulate unprecedented desire in clich?s; the results may sound like insincerity, paradox, or parody, depending in part on the reader's assumptions. In contrast, the spare particularity of such short lyrics as "Western Wind" almost fuses the personal with the elemental. That example should indicate that I do not mean to attribute overt conflict to all lyric discourse. But even lyrics justly celebrated for simplicity achieve their intensity, their poignancy, by not quite merging opposed standpoints?immediacy and timelessness, in dividuality and anonymity. If, then, complexity and irony are by no means alien to the lyric, as earlier critics claimed,8 we need not be surprised at the genre's attrac tion for a poet seldom associated with simple self-expression. Several recent critics suggest that Chaucer characteristically embeds lyric in other forms, such as narrative;9 I submit that his self-contained lyrics are more profoundly complex, for they expose the genre's own con trary impulses. Nowhere is Chaucer's lyric genius more evident than in his most undervalued short poem, the bricolage of lyric subjectivity usually known as the Complaint of Mars.10 Clemen compares the opening of the Complaint of Mars to "a whole series of rooms" through which readers must pass "before reaching what the title had promised."11 In the first two stanzas, commands and warnings evoke a first-person narrator: Gladeth, ye foules, of the morowe gray. Lo, Venus, rysen among yon rowes rede. . . . But ye lovers, that lye in any drede, Fleeth, lest wikked tonges yow espye. (1-2, 5-6)</page><page sequence="3">166 THE CHAUCER REVIEW But the thirteenth line attributes those utterances to a bird, overheard on Valentine's Day by an unnamed "I." This outer narrator speaks only two lines before yielding again to the bird, which continues its dawn-song for another rhyme-royal stanza and then decides to honor St. Valentine by singing "The sentence of the compleynt, at the leste, / That woful Mars made atte departyng / Fro fresshe Venus in a morwenynge" (24-26). Next comes an eighteen-stanza story of Mars and Venus, which the bird narrates so unobtrusively that readers probably forget him (or her). Then, midway through the poem, the bird proposes to repeat Mars's complaint and then to depart, wishing "every wyght joy of his make" (154). The complaint proper is spoken by Mars with no trace of avian or human narrator. By no means could this narratorial relay be "the expression by the poet of his own feelings." At the same time, what Jay Ruud calls the "manipulation of different speaking voices"12 foregrounds the essen tial feature of all lyric, first-person discourse. Forced repeatedly to reassess the speaker's identity, we see the poem initially through a prism of Is. Nor does the perspective stabilize within the two major sections, the Story and Complaint. Nominally, those sections center on Mars. Thus several critics regard the Story as Mars's retelling of the Ovidian myth and read the Complaint as a dramatic monologue. To be sure, those crit ics find the viewpoint ironic: they argue that Chaucer expects us to see Mars as emasculated by lust,13 misguided by self-interest,14 and trapped in pre-Christian moral blindness.15 But despite his limitations?rather, by virtue of them?Mars shapes the poem, for such critics, much as do the personae of Romantic and Victorian lyrics. The difficulty with that approach is that the Complaint of Mars repre sents Mars himself as a compound and even incoherent subject. "Whilom," the bird begins, the thridde he venes lord above, As wel by hevenysh revolucioun As by desert, hath wonne Venus his love, And she hath take him in subjeccioun, And as a maistresse taught him his lessoun, Commaundynge him that nevere, in her servise, He nere so bold no lover to dispise. (29-35) The lines admit at least four paraphrases, each based in a different realm of discourse: the goddess of love has subjugated the god of war, or a noble suitor has both conquered and yielded to his lady, or the planets Mars and Venus have moved within 7V2 degrees of one</page><page sequence="4">CAROLYNN VAN DYKE 167 another, or a "platic" planetary conjunction has let Venus's "benevo lent [astrological] influence [temper] Mars's evil effects."16 Pledging "perpetuall obeisaunce" (47) and love, Mars and Venus then agree to meet soon in Venus's "nexte paleys" (54); such behavior is natural for human lovers, of course, but scholars note that in 1385, the two planets moved into exact conjunction in the sign of Taurus, Venus's next astrological domicile.17 In fearing his "myschef in that place" (58), Mars refers presumably to his astrological disadvantage while he awaits Venus "in the opposite of his chief domicile Scorpio";18 alterna tively, we can say simply that the faithful lover will be in mortal danger while separated from his "hertes lady swete" (57). Fortu nately, his compassionate lady hurries to meet him?or, as the as tronomers would have it, Venus now moves about eighty minutes of arc a day to Mars's forty-four.19 Alas, Phebus later enters Venus's "paleys," forcing her to flee?perhaps representing jealousy, perhaps only signaling that Mars and Venus move out of conjunction as the Sun approaches.20 This juggling of referents may be, as J. M. Manly alleged a century ago, "a mere exercise of ingenuity in describing a supposed astronomi cal event in terms of human action and emotion."21 More recently, several readers have recast the same judgment more favorably, associ ating the poem's incongruities with Metaphysical wit.22 I would argue that the wit goes beyond play to serve at least as literary parody: the characters' radical ambiguities caricature the divisions in the ostensibly singular subjects of love-lyrics. The congruence of courtly discourse with Ovidian myth, planetary mechanics, and astrological patterns confirms unmistakably that, as Stone says, "The voice of medieval lyric is not the voice of an autonomous ego or self-determining subject that masters language but rather that of a fragmented ego mastered by language, the site at which converge various alien and conventional voices."23 But as in so many of his works, Chaucer's wit does not simply de flate. Rather, his deconstruction of subjectivity in the Complaint of Mars is also a powerful reconstruction. To explain, I turn now to a reading of three key passages in which Chaucer simultaneously splits and forges a lyric subject. The first comes from the unhappy climax of the poem's earlier, narrative half. When Phebus comes to reveal the lovers and burn them "with his hete" (88, 91), Venus weeps and embraces Mars. As for Mars, the narrator tells us, In stede of teres, from his eyen tweyne The firi sparkes brosten out for peyne,</page><page sequence="5">168 THE CHAUCER REVIEW And hente his hauberk that ley hym besyde. Fie wolde he not, ne myghte himselven hide. He throweth on his helm of huge wyghte, And girt him with his swerd, and in his hond His myghty spere, as he was wont to fyghte, He shaketh so that almost hit towond. Ful hevy was he to walken over lond; He may not holde with Venus companye But bad her fleen lest Phebus her espye. (95-105) After treating Mars most recently as planet and courtier, Chaucer here foregrounds his identity as god of war. Simultaneously, he presents this deity as singularly helpless?"a god who fails to be god-like," in James Dean's words;24 Chaucer shows here his debt to Ovid, who "reduce[s] heroic figures to the status of amorous exemplars" and "make[s] fun of them for their crudeness and epic solemnity."25 Thus some readers find Mars ridiculous or contemptible.26 Unlike his counterpart in the Metamorphoses, however, Chaucer's god of war is still demonstrably a planet, and therefore?paradoxically? more eligible for pity than for contempt. Within a few lines ( 1 lOff.), the narrator recasts the lovers' parting as the ending of their astronomical conjunction, which of course Mars can't prevent. That is, Mars can't help being helpless. The opposing implications of myth and astronomy not only coexist but comment on each other. Mars's unwieldy armor is a metaphor for cosmological law; his frustrated spear-shaking anthropo morphizes that law as constraint. Superimposing god and planet, Chau cer shows us what it would be like to be a self trapped in a planet.27 In a second passage, midway through his Complaint, Mars contem plates his own entrapment. Somewhat like Troilus in Book IV but with more justification, he decides that his suffering was predestined. In particular, Mars declares that God constrains "folk" to love, "maigre her hed" (218?20). He elaborates in two similes: like a fisher, God baits men with "som plesaunce" (238), only to let the line break and leave the fish wounded (237-44); or again, God has made Venus as beauti ful as the notorious Brooch of Thebes, which inspired insane pursuit and equally mad fear of loss (245-56). The fault lay not in the Brooch itself, Mars says, for "in the worcher was the vice, / And in the cove tour that was so nyce" (261-62). Those allegations have earned Mars stern rebukes from several mod ern readers.28 As Gardiner Stillwell writes, to blame God for one's own amorous pain "from the Boethian point of view is altogether witless."29 But to criticize Mars implies that he might have behaved differently, an</page><page sequence="6">CAROLYNN VAN DYKE 169 implication that rebounds against the very constraints that he laments. One wonders, for instance, how a pagan deity could have "subordi nated] [venereal love] to the greater glory of God"30 and what it would mean for a planet to make proper use of free will31 or to see his "life" without "self-interest."32 Granted, Mars himself sometimes speaks as if he had chosen his course, as his critics note. But his assumption of responsibility is no more valid than his blasphemy. Only on the astro nomical level is Mars's story literally true, and on that level, he has neither free will nor grounds for complaint, for he has no subjectivity. Nonetheless, most readers find his plight somehow poignant.33 Mars moves us not because we take him to be human but because we are amazed that he might be. That is, the poem's central meaning lies in its unexpected anthropomorphism. Thus when Mars tentatively blames God for his pain, the appropri ate response is neither to reject his blasphemy nor to condone it but to acknowledge its possibility?to recognize that certain planetary events, conjoined with eponymous myths, mimic the situations in which peo ple blaspheme. More broadly, when Mars and Venus speak like autono mous subjects, Chaucer surely intends us not to decide whether or not planetary Intelligences have free will but to marvel with him that our mythic and astrological accounts of Mars and Venus, when com pounded, model the entanglement of necessity and freedom in human narratives. Miraculously, the cosmos mirrors our subjectivity. Even stronger cosmic reflections illuminate my third passage, the poem's masterful conclusion. Abandoning his inconclusive specula tions about causation, Mars appeals for pity: But to yow, hardy knyghtes of renoun, Syn that ye be of my devisioun, Al be I not worthy to so gret a name, Yet, seyn these clerkes, I am your patroun; Therfore ye oghte have som compassioun Of my disese, and take hit not a-game. (272-77) As before, his very remoteness from us produces fellow-feeling. Em barrassed about his superhuman powers, anticipating the response of critics who find his helplessness incongruous with his divinity, Mars bridges the ontological gap between us and him by acknowledging it. Mars further merits compassion by showing it himself. He reserves his most eloquent complaint for Venus, whom he last saw frightened and grief-stricken. Naturally piteous ladies should mourn with Venus, he says, "Sith that youre emperise, the honurable, / Is desolat" (285 86). And lovers should complain, "al-infere, / For her that with</page><page sequence="7">170 THE CHAUCER REVIEW unfeyned humble chere / Was evere redy to do yow socour" (290?93). As he has just done with Mars, Chaucer emphasizes Venus's astrologi cal identity rather than fully anthropomorphizing her. And he invites us not just to cross but to reverse her ontological distance from us: the avatar of Love and Beauty needs our pity. Compleyneth her that evere hath had yow dere; Compleyneth Beaut?, Fredom, and Manere; Compleyneth her that endeth your labour; Compleyneth thilke ensample of al honour, That never dide but al gentilesse; Kytheth therfore on her sum kyndenesse. (293-98) Readers who remember the poem's opening may associate the cos mic empathy here asked of us with the cross-species narratorial relay that frames the Complaint of Mars. Mars, we may recall, here ad dresses knights and ladies only in apostrophe: his solitary complaint has been overheard by a bird, relayed to other birds, overheard yet again, and finally conveyed?presumably through another interspe cies translation?to his intended audience. We are probably meant to take those fabrications lightly, but even if we forget most of them, we perceive that Mars's complaint issues not from a solid persona but from an / refracted across the universe. The rays ultimately converge. Throughout, the poem's subjects and voices?planets, pagan deities, astrological powers, courtiers, birds, pre sumably even the poet?have seemed to unite in the experience that they share with the audience, the experience of love. I say "seemed" advisedly: Chaucer's irony concedes that most of his subjects love only figuratively. And the poem's final line acknowledges the need for our assent to that figure. "Kytheth therfore on her sum kyndenesse," Mars pleads (298): not just "show kindness" to Venus, but "acknowledge common nature" with the poem's whole gallery of nonhuman lovers. Jonathan Culler notes that for Paul de Man, lyric writing depends on prosopopeia and apostrophe, figures that "give a face to nonperceptual entities."34 De Man thus suggests that the lyric ego is not transparent, as we have assumed; it looks most genuine through a mask and speaks most strongly to the nonhearing. The lyric subject of the Complaint of Mars, split among incongruous masks and voices, might seem to be even further attenuated. But what shines through all the masks, what hears all the nonhuman speakers, is of course the implied audience. Chau cer's lyric subject is a reader or hearer discovering empathy with a distant /, one that, like us, both is and is not an autonomous self.
