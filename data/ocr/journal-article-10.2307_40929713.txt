<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lexical Discontinuities between Generations: Recent Inuit Cases from North Baffin Island Guy Bordin Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales Abstract. During recent fieldwork in North Baffin Island, I came across several Inuit terms well known by elders but fading into oblivion among young people. In an apparent paradox, these more or less forgotten words among young Inuit generations designate objective situations that in most cases still belong to the contemporary world, at least as possibilities. It is argued that the loss of these words is the result of the obsolescence of the social practices and cultural understandings that the words reference. 1. Introduction. According to a widespread notion, languages are born, live, and die. Although this biological metaphor of a life cycle applied to languages - that is, languages seen as "living organisms" - is rarely questioned, since it has been taken for granted for centuries,1 it is far from being soundly grounded. However, languages are dynamic systems in the sense that their phonology, lexicon, morphology, and syntax are not fixed forever, but evolve over time. As regards the lexicon, the topic of this article, one is faced with two main phenom- ena. On the one hand, the reasons leading to the incorporation of new words into a language are most often self-evident - to name new objects, notions, concepts, fashions, and trends, brought about by socioeconomic, political, religious, or technical changes. New realities affecting a society imply that the terminology must be adapted accordingly. This is done by various modes of lexical extension: lexicalization (or coinage), borrowing, semantic extension, or calquing. In Inuk- titut, the language spoken by Inuit of the eastern Canadian Arctic, neology is very active and the first mode is currently by far the most widely used (Therrien 2000; Teveny 2003; Bordin 2003; Berge and Kaplan 2005) and applies to all fields of experience. On the other hand, words also stop being used by linguistic communities, more or less gradually disappearing from current and shared lexicons or, in the case of polysemic terms, losing some of their meanings. The reasons for the disuse and loss of words or meanings are not always as easily identifiable. For languages with a deep-rooted written tradition, old texts and dictionaries may keep track of today's forgotten words and meanings. In the case of languages that were long purely orally transmitted, the establishment of lexical reposi- tories is much more challenging and often highly dependent on the history of the contacts of native speakers with outsiders who may have at one stage introduced writing. Whether in the Americas, Africa, or the Pacific, and regardless of the different time periods, the writing of many oral languages often started through 191</page><page sequence="2">192 Anthropological Linguistics 51 nos. 3-4 the translation and printing of the Bible and other religious books. This was the scenario among Inuit societies between the first half of the eighteenth century in West Greenland and the first decades of the twentieth century for some groups of eastern Arctic Canada (Harper 1985; Dorais 1996:l8l-200).2 Most of the early bilingual dictionaries for the Inuit were indeed written by missionaries,3 and it is only recently that monolingual Inuit dictionaries have been produced, often by elders or under their guidance. From a diachronic perspective, one may consider the disuse and loss of current words and the process of generation and integration of new words or new meanings of existing words as mirroring the state of being of a linguistic group, this state being in turn deeply affected by the socioeconomic, political, cultural, and sociolinguistic context of the time. As pointed out above, finding out why a word has disappeared or lost its meaning(s) is not always straightforward. To cite some readily understandable cases, one can mention the many terms designating common objects, tools, weapons, or techniques that once were used in Europe but were abandoned centuries ago, and that have consequently disappeared from the usual contem- porary vocabulary of languages such as English or French. As Aitchison points out, "Unneeded words drop out: items of clothing which are no longer worn such as doublet or kirtle are now rarely mentioned outside a theatrical setting" (2001: 146). Similarly, Dorais (1996:133) notes that few contemporary Inuit know what an umiarluk is: a raft boat used to cross lakes and rivers during summer inland migrations. But there are much less obvious situations, as illustrated by the Inuit cases that constitute the core of this article. I happened to be confronted with the topic of Inuit word loss during recent fieldwork in the Inuit community (village) of Mittimatalik (Pond Inlet), in the north of Baffin Island (Nunavut, Canada), above the Arctic Circle. My research there did not deal originally with this matter as such, but rather was aimed primarily at the collection of ethnographic and linguistic data pertaining to the description and representation of the night among people living in this high- arctic community (Bordin 2002, 2008). However, during my stays I came across several words4 that nowadays display a distinct stratification between genera- tions; briefly, they are all known by elders, but have faded into oblivion among the younger adults (about forty years old and younger) who were randomly asked about them, even though they are all fluent in their mother tongue and use it in many aspects of daily life. It is important to note that the rate of speak- ers of the Inuit language is very high in Mittimatalik, as in all other North Baffin communities. According to the 2006 Canadian census, 92 percent of the 1,315 inhabitants of Mittimatalik were Inuit; 100 percent of those had Inuktitut as their mother tongue and for 94 percent Inuktitut was the most widely used language at home (Statistics Canada). However, most Mittimatalik Inuit are, in fact, bilingual (only about one hundred people, the oldest ones, do not know Eng- lish), and have been schooled largely in English (Dorais and Sammons 2002).</page><page sequence="3">2009 Guy Bordin 193 In this article, I look at the following terms: unnuattak 'bright night of spring', unnuijuq 'seal hunter at breathing holes at night in winter', sinnaaq- taujuq 'one who is the victim of an aggression while asleep', itinngitainnaqtuq 'one who never wakes up, i.e., dies in his sleep', and taulittuq 'someone who is moving but not getting any closer to his destination'. For each word, I first dis- cuss its meaning and provide examples of its use, then try to ascertain what could have led to its recent disuse and, in most cases, replacement by more generic words and expressions. The quotations used to illustrate my analyses are extracted from interviews carried out in Inuktitut with Inuit inhabitants from Mittimatalik in 2003, 2005, and 2006; hence, they are first given in Inuktitut and then translated into English. A morphological analysis of terms is proposed and commented upon whenever it provides added value to the discussion. 2. The bright night of spring. Throughout the Inuit linguistic continuum, unnuaq designates the night. Besides this term, another word is attested in North Baffin Island (from Iglulik to Mittimatalik) to refer specifically to the bright night that reigns in spring and early summer at those high latitudes: unnuattak (MacDonald 1998:202; Quassa 2000; Bordin 2002). An elderly man explains: Taaqsiqattanngiliqtilluguli unnuangujuq taanna qaumainnaqattalisuungu- gattali maani siqinniinnaliqpak&amp;ulalu, siqiniq talittinaililluni maani, unnuangugaluaq taanna siqiniq attisijaraangat unnuattaunirasuungujavuL Taanna ukiukkut unnuangunirasuungullutigu unnuaq taaqsijuq taimannatuaq, ii qaumainnaqattaliqtillugu unnuattaunirarunnaqtavut unnuangujugaluaq. [Isimaili Katsak p.c. 2003] 'When the night does not get dark any more, when we have continuous light, when the sun is present all the time and does not set, it is nevertheless still the night when the sun goes down, and we call it unnuattak. We call the night unnuaq in winter when it gets dark, it is like that, when there is light all the time, we call the night unnuattak and it is still the night.'5 The morphological analysis of the word itself demonstrates that although there is no darkness during the period called unnuattak, the bright night is not to be confused with the day - the root unnua- expresses that it is a nocturnal episode. However, it is not the ordinary dark night, hence the correction by the means of the postbase -ttak, which most likely expresses the notion of 'being like'. It is worth emphasizing that unnuattak is used strictly to designate the night when the sun never sets below the horizon. As soon as the night starts to include some darkness - around mid-August in Mittimatalik - it is referred to as unnuaq. This nocturnal darkening, at first very limited, but then lengthening and deepening throughout summer and early fall, is also designated by a specific term, ijujuq. The phenomenon is described as follows:</page><page sequence="4">194 Anthropological Linguistics 51 nos. 3-4 Ijujuq taima aagiisimi ijuttalirniarmijuq. Manna siqiniq uijjaatuinnaqtaqpuq, aagiisiuliruni siqiniq nipittaalirluni taaqsirujuqattaliruni, taw a taaqsirujuk- tuq ijujuq, taallattaanngittuq taaqsirujuktuq, ijujuq. [John Tuurngaq p.c. 2005] 'Ijujuq will occur in August. Right now [i.e., early July, the time of the meeting], the sun is always present but when August arrives the sun will start to set and it will begin to get slightly dark, not yet full darkness, only light darkness; this is ijujuq/ In North Baffin, there is a continuum from unnuattak 'bright night of spring' to unnuaq 'dusk then dark night' by way of ijujuq 'progressive night darkening*. The term unnuattak is piujuq 'good, accurate', as it was characterized by an elderly woman. However, despite its being a perfectly good lexical item, my investigation shows that it has tended to fall into disuse. Elders know the word, but only some of them mark spontaneously the semantic distinction between unnuaq and unnuattak, anticipating that their interlocutor - unless this were another elder - would most likely not grasp the meaning of the latter. Indeed, many younger people from Mittimatalik do not know it, and have never heard about it; for them, the time segment starting roughly around midnight is called unnuaq whatever the degree of darkness of the night.6 John MacDonald (p.c. 2009) made similar observations in Iglulik. It should also be noted that the word ijujuq follows an evolution similar to that of unnuattak. The origin for this lexical impoverishment did not at first appear obvious to me. A middle-aged woman suggested, however, an interesting point of view about the disuse of unnuattak. According to her, it may be linked to the fact that present-day younger Inuit generations no longer practice the large-scale spring and summer migrations for which night provided the best traveling conditions - in spring, lower temperatures, better ice conditions, and greater comfort and safety for their dogs, and in summer, the absence of mosquitoes. For these rea- sons, traveling in the bright season, especially in late spring, often meant travel- ing at night, i.e., unnuattakkut. One has to be aware that the word "traveling" used in this context meant first, migrations of entire groups of people from winter camps to spring and summer camps, and second, unceasing spring and summer journeys to hunting grounds, often over long distances. The settlement into permanent communities that took place in the 1960s in the Canadian Arctic virtually put an end to this way of life. When I presented several young people from Mittimatalik with this explanation linking the knowledge and the use of unnuattak to past spring and summer traveling through the land, which I myself find quite convincing, they all found it relevant. Similarly, elders from Iglulik point out quite simply that Inuktitut is the language of the land, not of the settlement, and as the younger generations proportionately make less and less use of the land, such lexical erosion can only be expected (John MacDonald p.c. 2009). The need to have a specific designation for the night in spring and early summer (bright night) most likely resulted - at least in part - from the</page><page sequence="5">2009 Guy Bordin 195 significant advantage provided by traveling and hunting during this segment of the twenty-four-hour cycle in those seasons, and not merely on the existence of this astronomical phenomenon per se. Otherwise, there would be no relevant reason for the present-day loss of the designation. 3. Seal hunting at breathing holes at night. The second term I want to discuss here, unnuijuq, is also linked to 'night' and its expression in Inuktitut. According to elders throughout the eastern Arctic (Nunavut and Nunavik),7 unnuijuq designates a person engaged in a very specific type of hunting. Taannali unnuijuq tukisijara unnuakkut nikpaqtuq. Unnuiniraqtauvalaur- mata unnualimaaq nikparnialiq&amp;uniuk qailaunnginnilimaangani. [John Tuurngaq p.c. 2005] 'In my view, unnuijuq designates a person who is hunting seals at breathing holes at night. Hunters called unnuijut spent the whole night waiting at breathing holes and did not come back until they had caught a seal.' The morphological analysis of this term reveals that the nocturnal aspect of the activity it designates (the fact that the event takes place at night) is crucial, as it constitutes the lexical basis of its etymology (from unnuaq ' night'). How- ever, the relation of the term to hunting is not straightforward, as it contains no lexical reference to hunting or sealing. It seems most likely that over time the word acquired a specialized meaning in the language used in the eastern Canadian Arctic ('spending the night sealing'), whereas it kept a more general meaning in other parts of the Inuit linguistic continuum. The latter is the case in Kalaallisut (West Greenland), as well as in Tunumiisut (East Greenland), where unnuijuq is applied to someone who 'spends the whole night somewhere' (Berthelsen et al. 1997; Tersis 2008). Night sealing is a highly demanding physical activity that has for long been necessary to the life of Inuit families during winter and early spring. Hunters often spent many hours on the ice, in the cold and the dark, waiting for a seal to show up at its breathing hole where it would be harpooned. The term unnuijuq stresses the fact that a hunter frequently had to stay the whole night at his sealing spot. But this is not the case anymore. This type of hunting is no longer vital and consequently not commonly practiced. Those who still enjoy hunting seals at night in winter spend much less time waiting at a breathing hole. Calling such a hunter unnuijuq would probably sound quite inappropriate to elders who still remember the necessity and hardship associated with this hunt- ing technique. Nowadays, some people extend the use of unnuijuq to designate 'a person who has to do the same thing all night'. On the whole, however, the term is rarely heard, is often not understood by young people, and appears ready to be replaced by the widely used generic word unnuoqsiuti 'somebody who is active - for whatever reason - all night' {unnuaq 'night', -siuti 'something or somebody</page><page sequence="6">196 Anthropological Linguistics 51 nos. 3-4 linked to'). A woman in her fifties told me explicitly that it was indeed in past times (immakallak) that Inuit hunters could be called unnuijut? 4. Victim of an attack while asleep. The third word to be considered is sinnaaqtaujuq and it takes us into the state of sleep. This term in the passive form designates generically 'a person who while asleep is the victim of some sort of aggression by a third party', human or otherwise (sinnaaq- 'be a victim of aggression while asleep', -taq- 'passive marker', -u- 'existence', -juq 'nominal- ization'). Here is the explanation given by the late John Tuurngaq. Suurlu sinaanganii&amp;&amp;unga nattiqutialukka maktaaqutialukka niqiqutialukka majjautillugit, siniktillunga nanuq tikinniruni niqiqutikka nirirujuujarnirlugit imanna tavua sinnaaq tauvunga. Siniktunga qaujinnginakku sunauvva niqi- qutikka piugarujuujaqtangit. Inukpaluunniit piqutinik pigaluarniqpat siningmut qaujinnginnama tavva sinnaaqtauvunga. [John Tuurngaq p.c. 2005] 'I am, for instance, on the ice edge, and I have with me seal meat, or maktaaq [skin of narwhal or beluga], or some other food; when I have fallen asleep, if a bear comes and eats my food, then I will be sinnaaqtaujuq. Being asleep, I was not aware of my food being stolen. If my belongings are stolen by another person during my sleep, I am also sinnaaqtaujuq/ The most frequently cited meaning for the term is also the most dramatic, where the person who is sinnaaqtaujuq is killed in their sleep (sinnaaqtaujuq siniktillugu tuqutaujuq), either by an ordinary person or by a shaman (anga- kkuq).9 To illustrate this situation, the late Timuti Kalluk recalled one episode of the epic story Atanarjuat10 in which the men of another family attack the heroes Atanarjuat and his elder brother while they are sleeping in their tent after returning from a long and tiring hunt. It has also been related that, in former times, evil tuurngait 'helping spirits of shamans' could take advantage of people's sleep to make them sick (Salumi Ka&amp;&amp;ak Qalasiq [Kolb and Law 2001a:149 (Inuktitut), 2001b:123 (English)]). Aggression against somebody in his sleep is certainly not an Inuit specialty. It is nevertheless worth noting that this malevolent act has a specific designa- tion in Inuktitut, consisting of a term built on a lexical root (sinnaaq-) most likely linked to that used for sleep (sinik-fsinnak-), and not on a root that would, for instance, relate to the notion of 'harming somebody'. What matters to the victim is that he was robbed, assaulted, or even killed, and not so much that it happened during his sleep. I have suggested elsewhere (Bordin 2008; Galinier et al. in press) that the motivation of the term sinnaaqtaujuq, taken into account together with a number of other ethnographic elements, tends to show that, for many Inuit, sleep itself has never been a state accorded much value. But that is another issue. One should also note that although the base sinnaaq- can most logically be used in the active mode, as in the example below, in the other few references</page><page sequence="7">2009 Guy Bordin 197 where I found mention of it (Quassa 2000:538; Uuttuvak, Tuurngaq, and Nutaraq 1990:7, 1991:115), as well as my own collected data, it is always in the passive form, expressing the victim's point of view, so to speak. Taissumani ukpirasuaqqaatinnagit ilaminik tuquttinasukpanirmata sinili- raangata taakkua, taakkua tuqutlinasuktut siniliqsiillutik, sinnaarumallugu. [Timuti Kalluk p.c. 2005] 'In the past, before Christianity, some people tried to kill other people in their sleep; they waited for people to be asleep to kill them, they wanted to kill them in their sleep.' Although this term is known by all the elders and adults who were inter- viewed on the matter, none of the several younger Inuit who I asked had ever heard of it, nor were they able to understand its specific meaning. One wonders about its near demise, since the offending acts of violence against sleeping people have not disappeared, although nowadays they may present a different face. Once again, in order to understand the present situation, one should con- sider changes of social and cultural context. When elderly Timuti Kalluk evokes sinnaaqtaujuq in the quote above, he takes his audience backwards into the past (taissumani), before Qallunaat 'white people' settled permanently in the Arctic and brought Christianity to the Inuit. In those times, blood feuds and family retaliations were quite normal ways of avenging murders, adulteries, or kidnap- pings, or simply of venting jealousy (Bennett and Rowley 2004:99-105), as is illustrated in the story of Atanarjuat. Killing people in their sleep was not an uncommon practice. A young woman, who since has become one of the first Inuit lawyers in Canada, declared in 1995: A man (Iqalugaq) murders another (Inuksiaq). Inuksiaq's son or one of his relatives will then kill Iqalugaq. Imagine how Iqalugaq would feel knowing that he will probably be killed, perhaps when he is sleeping or waiting for a seal during the dark season. [Inuaraq 1995:256] Nowadays, shamanism as a social institution, and vendettas as a means of settling various types of conflicts, have ceased to rule collective life. One may assume that these major changes have played a large part in the disuse of the word sinnaaqtaujuq by contemporary Inuit other than elders. 5. One who no longer wakes up. I heard the next term for the first time during a dream narration by an elderly woman.11 The story goes as follows: she enters a big house in which there are many rooms and doors. She wants to get out but she cannot. Each time she opens a door hoping it would lead outside, she finds herself in a new room. She starts to be scared and then awakes. She said she had had a dream like this several times since she was a teenager. The very first time she had it, she told it to a young woman slightly older than her.</page><page sequence="8">198 Anthropological Linguistics 51 nos. 3-4 Uqautilauqsimangmaanga itinngitainnakasaktungaguuq, apiriliq&amp;ugu 'qanuqV itinngitainnakasaktungaguuq iqqummanngitainnakasaktungaguuq.

[Aani Pairngut Putaluusi p.c. 2005] 'She told me that itinngitainnakasaktungaf so I asked her: 'What?' and she said itinngitainnakasaktunga meaning that I was almost on the point of not waking up anymore, i.e., not coming back to life. She went on to say that those who dream of not being able to get out may never wake up again and they are called itinngitainnaqtut. She said that I almost went there. I was very young, maybe seventeen. I have a similar dream every now and then, where I am in a house and I try to get out but I cannot make it. ' The term itinngitainnaqtuq is built on the verb root itiq-, from the Proto- Eskimo form *atdr- 'wake up' (Fortescue, Jacobson, and Kaplan 1994)- Thus, itinngitainnaqtuq means literally 'someone who will no longer wake up' (itiq- 'wake up', -nngit- 'negation', -tainnaq- 'at last, finally', -tuq 'nominalization'), a striking euphemism to designate a person who dies while asleep. The woman had apparently had a premonitory dream or an omen of a sort. Other elderly interviewees confirmed that this word is used to describe someone who will not recover consciousness from sleep, that is, who will die - perhaps from being too deeply asleep, as suggested by one woman: "Siniluarnikumut nukiqarunniirami uummatingalu nuqqaq&amp;uni tuquinnaq&amp;uni, taimanna itinngitainnarniraq- tauuuq [Because of sleeping too deeply, the person has lost their energy and the heart stops beating, the person dies; this is called itinngitainnaqtuqY (Anguili- anuk Qijuapik p.c. 2005). I noticed also that young people from Mittimatalik who were asked about the word were not aware of it and did not grasp its meaning. One may wonder about the reasons that led to the disuse of this word, even though it was probably never used very often. The lexical loss could be related to the current infrequency of dream narration and sharing, which used to be widespread (Bordin 2008, 2009). Indeed, it was while recalling a dream that Pairngut Piitaluusi first heard of the existence and meaning of itinngitainnaq- tuq. But there might also be a more linguistic reason for the loss of the term, as a deeper look at the base itiq- suggests.12 Interestingly, this base is still quite productive in Greenlandic, both in Kalaallisut and Tunumiisut. For instance, we find for the latter itiqpuq 'he wakes up', itiaaqpuq 'he wakes up early', or itiqsaqpaa 'he wakes him up' - all phrases that are no longer found in Inuktitut; instead, in present-day Inuktitut the notion of 'waking up' is expressed with the roots iqqumma-13 and tupaq-. The only other term derived from itiq- 'wake up' still used in Inuktitut is itillimajuq 'sleepwalker'. Although iqqumma- (and</page><page sequence="9">2009 Guy Bordin 199 iqqima- in Tunumiisut) is also derived from the same Proto-Eskimo base *dtdr~, most contemporary Inuktitut speakers probably do not make any semantic link between iqqumma- and itiq-. The fact that itiq- is only residual in Inuktitut might also explain the disuse of a term built on it, such as itinngitainnaqtuq, which furthermore, because of its very meaning, could hardly belong to everyday speech. 6. Traveling but no longer moving forward. The last word I discuss here is also one that refers to a most enigmatic phenomenon. This word is taulittuq, which is defined as follows: Taulittuq: ingirrajuq upagasuktaminut sivumu- gunnaillijuq tavvanitainnaaqquujiliqtuq taulippuq 'Taulittuq designates somebody who is traveling towards a chosen destination but cannot move forward any longer, he seems only to stay in the same place' (Quassa 2000). Let me first relate how I came to hear about this term. When I asked a number of people about their understanding of the word taujuq (Bordin 2002: 63), all of them replied rather similarly, focusing on the environmental notion of 'darkness of winter days*.14 However, two elderly interviewees added unex- pected statements such as the following: Imanna taulittualuuniraiuannirmingmataikua ingirragaluaq&amp;utik tavvani- tainnaanginnaujaqtualuuliq&amp;utik ingirragaluaq&amp;uni avunngaqpallia- junniiq&amp;uni taulittugguuq tukiqaqtuq, [. . .] taulinniraiqattalaurmata taimanna pisukkaluaq&amp;uniguuq taimanna atausitainnarmiinginnaq- tualuullutik taulittualuuniraqtauvalaurmata., taimmanali isumagijara. [Aani Pairngut Piitaluusi p.c. 2003] 'People were said to be taulittut when, although they were traveling, it was like they were staying in the same place, although they were moving they could not head to their destination anymore, this is called taulittuq, that is what it means, [. . .] people were said to be taulittut when, although they were walking, they seemed to be stuck in the same single place, I think that is what it means.' Further investigation sheds more light on this experience. All of the elderly people interviewed described taulittuq in ways rather similar to those given above. The common use of the morpheme -gunnailli- 'no longer able to' indicates that the phenomenon occurs when the person is already on the way and at a certain point something prevents him or her from continuing. This experience is thus labeled pituinnanngittuq by some people, which we may translate as 'ex- traordinary', literally, 'it is not just a simple phenomenon' (pi- 'do', -tuinnaq 'only, just', -nngit- 'negation', -tuq ' nominal ization'), and it appears hard to explain. Possible causes of the phenomenon taulittuq lie outside tangible percep- tion, unknown to most contemporary Inuit. Maybe what is called taulittuq originates from the will of a third party, such as a shaman, as suggested by John Tuurngaq15 from Mittimatalik, or the ijirait, a category of nonhuman beings living inland,16 according to the testimony of an elder from Iglulik published in</page><page sequence="10">200 Anthropological Linguistics 51 nos. 3-4 Uqalurait: An Oral History of Nunavut (Bennett and Rowley 2004:155). Mark Ijjangiaq relates that, one day in summer, he was walking inland with two com- panions. After a break, he started out again and while he was still close, the other two got up and started to follow him. He slowed down so that they could catch up with him, but each time he looked back, he saw that they were not getting any closer even though they were walking. It took a long time for them to catch up with him and the three men could resume walking together at a normal pace. Later on, one of the pair told him that while he was walking so slowly, they tried to go as fast as they could to reach him. Ijjangiaq suspected that they had experienced taulittuq, since in normal conditions his compan- ions would have caught up with him very quickly. According to him, they could have been controlled by ijirait. Some places were actually said to be dangerous because they were considered to be inhabited by "beings," and someone who de- cided to go to such a place on purpose would lose his strength (George Agiaq Kappianaq [Oosten and Laugrand 2001a:91-95 (Inuktitut), 2001b:80-83 (Eng- lish)]). Mark Ijjangiaq also adds in his testimony that he does not know where the word taulittuq comes from, but he points out that in the specific language that was used by shamans and supposedly by nonhuman beings in particular (often referred to as shamanic language), the word tau designated the Inuk (singular of Inuit), the human being (see, e.g., Rasmussen 1930:79). Tau is the 'shadow', referring to the fact that human beings have an invisible and im- mortal component (free-soul or shadow-soul) called tarniq in current Inuktitut. Hence, the elder from Iglulik seems to suggest implicitly that taulittuq could be linked to tau, i.e., to the notion of humans being perceived as carrying shadows. The experience taulittuq appears to be part of the wide semantic field of taaq 'darkness* to which the terms taujuq, tarniq, and tau also belong (Bordin 2008). Most people who know about taulittuq mention it as belonging to bygone times, a situation indeed labeled inullariksiuti by one adult woman, meaning literally 'which is tied to genuine Inuit'. In this case, inullarik 'genuine Inuit' refers to when nomadic Inuit still depended on hunting and fishing as their main resources, prior to the major changes that took place in the 1950s and 1960s. None of my interlocutors from Mittimatalik ever went through taulittuq personally, but they have all heard stories about it. As an elderly man explained, he was told about taulittuq so that he would not be surprised if he were to experience it. In contrast, my fieldwork shows that both the term and the phe- nomenon are unknown to younger people. The demise of the word is here proba- bly connected to that of the phenomenon, itself receding from the field of possible experiences with the reduction in long-distance travel, the end of shamanism as a ruling system, a reduced knowledge of both the land and of its nonhuman beings. 7. Sociolinguistic perspective. One must be aware that the lexical discon- tinuities presented here are not taking place in a monolingual Inuktitut-</page><page sequence="11">2009 Guy Bordin 201 speaking environment - far from it. Hence, we may think that the functional arguments proposed, whatever their merits, are perhaps not sufficient in them- selves to explain the whole phenomenon. Nunavut, like other Inuit territories today, constitutes a multilingual society in which most people can choose be- tween at least two languages, Inuktitut and English, to express themselves, depending on circumstances (at home, at school, at work, on the land, in church, dealing with administration, etc.) and on identity of interlocutors (parents, grandparents, children, siblings, friends, colleagues, persons in authority, etc.). Although the vast majority of eastern Canadian Arctic Inuit have Inuktitut as their mother tongue (see table 1), Dorais and Sammons (2002:5) recall that for historical and social reasons, it is not the Inuit language but English that constitutes the lingua franca of the Canadian Arctic, including Nunavut. Table 1. Use of Inuit language among Canadian Inuit Populations (by Inuit Region) Inuit region Inuit Inuit is mother Inuit is Able to population tongue language most converse in used at home inuit language Nunatsiavut 2,160 22% 7% 27% [Labrador] Nunavik 9,656 97% 94% 99% Nunavut 24,635 83%) 64% 91% Inuvialuit 3,115 14% 3% 20% [Inuit from the NWT] SOURCE: Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami 2008 (citing data from the Canadian census 2006, Statistics Canada). This is the case even in the Baffin Island region (Qikiqtaaluk), where the Inuit language has kept its strongest position compared to the two other regions of Nunavut (Kivalliq and Qitirmiut) - not to mention most parts of Alaska and the westernmost regions of Arctic Canada and Nunatsiavut (Labrador), where the Eskaleut languages are generally no longer or rarely transmitted to children (Dorais and Krupnik 2005). On Baffin Island, the only fully (or almost fully) monolingual inhabitants are found among two groups: most of the Inuit elders, who are monolingual in Inuktitut; and most of the Qallunaat, who came from southern Canada and are monolingual in English.17 Inuit communities are quite clearly diglossic. In the school system, it is only from kindergarten through grade 3 that children are taught in Inuktitut; after that instruction is conducted in English and Inuktitut is only a subject. In the Inuit communities, then, Eng- lish is clearly compulsory for anyone wishing to complete primary and secondary grades, read most books, watch most television programs, find a good job, com- municate with most authorities, etc. (Dorais and Sammons 2002:80).</page><page sequence="12">202 Anthropological Linguistics 51 nos. 3-4 This pervasive bilingualism is the core of the present-day sociolinguistic situation in the Canadian Arctic and hence, represents a background against which other language-related phenomena have to be appreciated, including the lexical discontinuities discussed here. 8. Conclusion. Understanding what may have happened to explain the present status of the terms recorded in Mittimatalik and presented and analyzed in this article implies taking into account the social practices in force at the time these words were still commonly known - actually not so long ago - and comparing them with those of today, including the sociolinguistic dimension. These terms display a rather similar diachronic evolution: they are still known by elders even though they hardly employ them, whereas younger people with whom I discussed the words had never heard them and could not figure out their meaning. However - and this appears paradoxical at first sight - as a mat- ter of simple description, the facts, acts, or events that each of them designates respectively still exist in contemporary society, at least as options: the bright night of spring is an astronomical reality and will always be there; seal hunting at night at the breathing hole, although no longer widespread, is still practiced by hunters who wish to do so; becoming a victim of aggression during sleep is always possible and, unfortunately, occasionally takes place, and people passing away in their sleep is still a fact. Only the experience represented by the last word, taulittuq, constitutes a more complicated case, since it does not refer to a "straightforwardly observable" phenomenon. On the other hand, what I call the "social stage" on which the habits and situations described above were experienced and perceived has changed pro- foundly: large-scale spring migrations no longer take place; seal hunting at night is no longer essential to ensure food provision in winter, and those who still hunt seals do not spend the whole night at the breathing holes; knowledge of the land has diminished; shamanism and vendettas belong to the past; and dream narration and sharing are not very common now. The great cultural changes that Inuit people have faced during the last fifty to sixty years caused them to engage in certain practices less and less, or to abandon them all together. The result has been the nontransmission between generations of the lexicon relevant to these practices and, consequently, the high level of its loss among today's younger people, who tend to use generic terms and paraphrases instead.18 One may speak of a cultural gap or discontinuity between generations (Utatnaq 1988). Dorais (1996:141) even states that some elders find it unacceptable and ridiculous that young people sometimes use terms related to formerly common techniques or activities of traditional culture that are no longer practiced. The poor lexical transmission is further increased or even fed by differences in knowledge and use of languages among generations. Whereas elders are monolingual Inuktitut speakers, younger people jump continuously between Inuktitut and English, depending on the context, in a setting where the pressure of English is very strong.</page><page sequence="13">2009 Guy Bordin 203 The older generation itself might actually be affected by word loss. For instance, working with elders to compile a dictionary in Utkuhiksalingmiutitut, the language of Utkuhiksalingmiut Inuit who used to live in the Chantrey Inlet region (the mouth of the Back River),19 the anthropologist Jean Briggs noted in 2002 that "elders forget the meanings of words they used to know - even words that they knew and explained to me in 1997 and 1998. They recognize the words when I read them out, but as the life that required those words recedes farther and farther into the past, people can't always remember what situations or objects a word applied to. Some, at least, regret forgetting" (Briggs 2002:70-71). My research confirms that the process of lexical oblivion can be quite rapid. The striking point of this whole process is that, for instance, the existence of a physical state as obvious as the brightness of the spring night in high latitudes is not enough to cause a particular word to be retained to describe it. More generally, this process demonstrates that what is perceived as objective descrip- tion is not always sufficient to cause specific designations to be developed or kept. The objective situation is necessary but not enough, and a social or cultural application is needed as well. Otherwise, the term may first gradually stop being used and then disappear from everyday speech. These Inuit cases from North Baffin confirm how deeply language and social practices are entwined with each other. But loss of vocabulary is not the whole story. The extreme vitality of neology in Inuktitut is a phenomenon that sup- ports the same conclusion from the opposite direction: younger Inuktitut speak- ers indeed know a whole range of new terms, most of which tend to be unknown to their parents or grandparents.

Transcription. The transcription of Inuktitut used in this article follows the official standardized Roman orthography adopted, together with the syllabic orthography, by Inuit Tapirisat of Canada in 1976 (Inuit Cultural Institute 1978). Note that the symbol &amp; is a voiceless alveolar fricative, ng a nasal velar, and; a voiced palatal. 1. The practice of characterizing languages as being born and dying largely began during the Italian Renaissance. See Heller-Roazen (2005) for an interesting reflection on the concept of language as an "organic body." 2. This does not mean that words were not recorded before the language started to be written by newcomers and native speakers. For instance, for the Inuit language, the</page><page sequence="14">204 Anthropological Linguistics 51 nos. 3-4 British explorer Parry (I824) collected about eight hundred terms from the north of Hudson Bay covering various fields of knowledge. 3. Among the first bilingual Inuit dictionaries, one can mention those by the Danish missionary Egede (1750), by Father Petitot (1876), and by the Anglican missionary Peck (1925). 4. In the Inuit language, typologically classified as polysynthetic, the word, a phono- logical unit that cannot contain a pause, often corresponds to a phrase (syntactic con- stituent) in, e.g., Indo-European languages. There is also structural identity between the phrase and the clause. For instance, igluliulauqtuq 'he (who) has built a house' is formally a word (it is a phonological unit), and also a phrase at the syntax level. This shows that the notions of "word/ "phrase," and "clause" cover different linguistic realities from one language to another, as is clearly the case between Inuit and Indo- EuroDean languages. 5. Translations from Inuktitut are by the author. 6. Once, in 2003, I asked a woman in her sixties whether she knew the word unnuattak and she said she did. Two of her daughters in their thirties were visiting at the time and I witnessed the mother explaining unnuattak to the young women, who did not know the term. 7. For instance, a definition of unnuijuq very similar to that from North Baffin Island is provided by the late Taamusi Qumaq from Puvirnituq, Nunavik, in his dictionary of Nunavik Inuttitut (1991). 8. Immakallak inullariit unnuiniraqtauqattalauqsimaqquunirmata tusaaqattaq- simagama angunasuktiit taikkua suurluguuq tavva nattirasugiaruni nikpainna- alukkuni unnuijuq 'I have heard that long time ago Inuit hunters were called unnuijut; the hunter waiting for seals at breathing holes was called unnuijuq' (Rosie Kalluk p.c. 2006). 9. Uuttuvak, Tuurngaq, and Nutaraq provide the following entry for sinnaaqtaujuq: sinnaaqtaujuq: 1) kinatuinnaq siniktillugu tuqutaugiaqtuq tuqutaujurluunniit angakkurmut sinnaaqtauniraqtauvuq; 2) inungmit qanuiliuqtuqarniqpat inungmut siniktillugu qaujinngilluni, taima sinnaaqtaugivuq. [1991:115] '1) Anyone who is killed in his sleep by a shaman is called sinnaaqtaujuq; 2) if a person acts against another while asleep and unconscious, one says that the latter is sinnaaqtaujuq.' 10. Atanarjuat is a mythical-historical epic from the Iglulik region. It tells the story of the two brothers, Atanarjuat and Aamarjuaq, who, after various events, are victims of an ambush. The elder brother, Aamarjuaq, is murdered in his sleep, but Atanarjuat manages to escape by running naked for his life across the spring sea ice. He later succeeds in getting his revenge (see Boas 1901:328-31; Saladin d'Anglure 2006:316-36). This story is at the origin of Canada's first feature-length fiction film written, produced, directed, and acted by Inuit (Atanarjuat / The Fast Runner, 2001). 11. This dream can be heard in the film J ai reve/Smnaktulauqpunga [1 have dreamt] by Guy Bordin and Renaud De Putter (2006; Gsara [www.gsara.be]). 12. The base itiq- 'wake up* (from Proto-Eskimo *dtar-) is not to be confused with the similar-looking base itiq- 'enter' (from Proto-Eskimo *itir-). In some dialects, such as North Baffin Inuktitut, the latter form has evolved into isiq- (isiqpuq 'he enters'); in others, such as Nunavik Inuttitut, it has remained itiq- (itiqpuq 'he enters'). 13. Besides the notion of 'waking up', that of 'being awake' is expressed by the root iqquma- in Inuktitut, iqqima- and iqiiq- in Tunumiisut, also deriving from the Proto- Eskimo *dtdr-.</page><page sequence="15">2009 Guy Bordin 205 14. The generic term for 'dark' is taaq, whereas taujuq applies specifically to the darkness of the winter days when the sun never sets above the horizon. 15. Pituinnanngittuq, qanuittukiaq amma nalunairunnanngikkillugu qanuingmat taulimmangaat, angakkumilluunniit taimaititaungmangaat qanuingmangaat nalu- nairunnanngikkillugu uqausittanga taanna kisiani taulittuq taimanna uqausiujuq taulittuq upagasuktaminut tikittunnaillijuq ingirrajualuuqquujilluni 'It is not an ordinary experience, but I do not know what it is and I cannot explain what taulittuq is, maybe it is caused by a shaman, but I cannot explain it; the word itself means that the person cannot reach his destination anymore although he looks like traveling at full speed' (John Tuurngaq p.c. 2005). 16. Ijirait are one of the many categories of nonhuman beings that share their territory with Inuit. Among their main characteristics, they are anthropomorphic but can take the form of caribou, they are strong and fast runners and can overtake caribous, and they are only visible to shamans (see, e.g., Rasmussen 1929:204-8; Evic-Twerdin 1991:17; Oosten and Laugrand 2004:100-103). 17. The sociolinguistic situation in Iqaluit, the capital city of Nunavut, is relatively different from that in the rest of Baffin Island. The Inuit represent 60 percent of the 6,085 Iqaluit inhabitants, but only 52 percent of the city population has an Inuit dialect as a mother tongue. Moreover, there are a significant number of native French speakers (about 5 percent), most of them bilingual in French and English (2006 Census, Statistics Canada). 18. A study carried out in Iglulik in 1975 revealed that young Inuit speakers aged eighteen to twenty-two were not aware of, or understood badly, the sense of about 20 percent of a sample of 224 common words (Dorais 1976). 19. Nowadays, Utkuhiksalingmiut Inuit live mostly in two communities, Uqsuqtuuq (Gjoa Haven) in the Qitiqmiut region of Nunavut and Kangiq&amp;iniq (Rankin Inlet) in the Kivalliq region of Nunavut.
