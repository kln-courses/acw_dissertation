<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians * By Vera Penteado Coelho This paper describes some of the results of my research undertaken at the village of the Waura Indians in the Xingu National Park during the months of August and September of 1978. On arriving at the village to undertake an investigation on pottery, my first intention was to learn the techniques by making a few pots, but, on being confronted with my lack of skill, my informants assigned to me only simple tasks, such as mixing clay with temper, smoothing pots or applying red paint. I did not acquire more specialized knowledge, such as that required to mold whole pieces or even zoomorphic appendages. (Of the latter, the few pieces I did make were undone by one of my teachers.) Only a certain inclination towards music saved me from total discredit. In spite of my lack of knowledge of musical theory, and of being incapable of transcribing music in pen tagrams, I managed to repeat the songs they taught me, thus affording my teachers a cer tain amount of satisfaction. I had already acquired a small repertory, when they decided to teach me a song which represented considerable innovation with regard to everything I had learned previously. One of my informants, Kamaya, indicating the various pots of her home would say the words "Kamalu hai" (Kamalu in Waura signifies clay) very loudly and in a bass tone, gradually reaching higher notes when pointing to pots of medium size. While indicating the smaller pots, the voice became softer to a point that the words were pronounced in a whisper which was barely intelligible. To make the lesson clearer, various circles were drawn on the floor and each, in accordance with its dimensions, would correspond to a kamalu hai, deeper and stronger or higher and softer according to a gradual musical scale. The classification of pottery among the Waura is as complex as any other primitive classification. I managed to compile long lists of names used to designate pieces of pottery, but I would not be capable of designating any pot by its correct name. I was able, however, to "sing" pottery series in a manner deemed fairly acceptable. As an archaeology student, I had the opportunity of examining more than one criterium for the classification of ceramics, but it was among the Waura that I learned a ' 'musical" division for the pieces used in a household, with which, I must say, it is much more fun to work than the phases, sub-phases, traditions and sub-traditions with which archeologists work the greater part of their time. It was only after this preliminary lesson that I was told the myth of the origin of clay, which has a close relationship to music. Before starting her narration, the informant drew various circles on the floor, beginn ing with a large one, followed by medium-sized ones until she arrived at a circle of quite reduced dimensions. The names were given in descending order: "Nukain, kamalupe, nukaantsain, nukaantsain pupuko, makula, makula puko, makulatain, alua kana, yalatu kana, itchiu kana, mayuwd kana, akuma kana, wasaikiana, tsake tsake, kupd kana, yapy kana, muluta kana, talapi kana, araukuma kana, puitchiana, * The original version of this article was written in Portugese to be published in a Festschrift in honor to Professor Doctor Egon Schaden.</page><page sequence="2">236 Vera Penteado Coelho suld kana, kuyuy kana, yutd kana, itsd kana ...

The first four refer to the larger pots and are followed by the names of zoomorphic pots, as is explained further on). Then she began to narrate: "First nukain goes in front. Kamalupe comes after. Nukaantsain comes after. Everything small pot come after. Then sang Kamalupe: ?

The myth of the origin of clay has two very distinct parts which were emphasized in the narration through a pause of the informant: the first refers to the appropriation of the clay by the Waura and the second to the transfer of clay, originally kept secret by the men, to the sphere of the women, connecting this passage to the Yamurikuma feast. This rever sal of the male and female roles is closely related to the Yamurikuma feast, an occasion when the tasks pertaining to each of the sexes are inverted. It is interesting to compare this myth, in which the Indians take possession of the raw material, learning through ex perience how to use it, with another Waura myth in which the Sun places at the disposal of the various tribes of the Xingu the goods which are the monopoly of each tribe in inter tribal commerce. (Schultz, 1964:33) (Agostinho, 1974:19). As can also be seen through the myth of origin, clay is an element which has strong mystical implications. It is therefore normal that precautions are taken with respect to it. Thus, both pregnant women and parents of very small children are forbidden from making pottery. A young woman, the mother of a child approximately three years old was strongly criticized for making pots: this would certainly cause the death of her child, it was said in the village. The same criticism was directed at the father of a small child who used to make pottery. In view of this, most of the potters whom we saw working were older people: almost all young people (men and women), although familiar with the technique of making pot tery, for magical reasons were barred from using it. The other important point with respect to the making of pottery which must be stress ed, is that both men and women dedicate themselves to this task. This represents a change from what was observed by anthropologists who had visited the Waura on previous occa sions. Lima (1950:10) indicates that pottery is an exclusively feminine task, and Schultz (Schultz and Chiara, 1968) - who visited the village in 1964 - records that the Chief Waura and one of his brothers were potters. In 1978,1 found that among the 93 inhabitants of the Waura village, 14 were potters, of which 7 were men and 7 women. It is possible that the increased contact with whites (through the Posto Indigena Leonardo Villas Boas) and with other tribes of the Xingu has created the need for greater production of pottery (which is overly important in inter-tribal commerce) and that men have begun this activity a relative ly short time ago. The painting which decorates the pots also has its origin explained by a myth, the Arakoni myth, which is not new in Waura literature, as Schultz (1964:76,80) had already collected and published it under the title of "Incest". The story of Arakoni was told more than once to me by my informant Wayeru. In comparison with the version collected by 6) Capy - Capy was another informant of mine.</page><page sequence="5">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians 239 Schultz, there were several variations, among which the most important is the connection of this personage with the origin of painting. A connection which was textually mentioned to me. Let us allow our informant to speak: "Arakoni was the first one to draw Ualamd neptako, Kulupeiene, Kupate ndbe, Sapalakd, Kuarrdta, Uene Uene Suco, KunheKunhe Rule Kana. (These are names of the patterns used in paintings: see explanations further on). It was him who drew. Arakoni had a sister, Kamayulalo. Arakoni had no woman. Still single. Sister was confined. Then mother went to field, came back, asked sister to help. (When they return from field carry ing on their heads a basket of manioc, the women ask the girls to help unload). Then saw that young girl was with paint. It was Kamayulalo. It was Kulupeiene. Then mother went to bathe. Saw that all boys were without paint. So mother understood that Arakoni had made love to sister. Then mother beat sister, beat Arakoni. Did not give food anymore to sister. Did not give food anymore to Arakoni. Then Arakoni went to field with friend. Then monkey whistled: ? Arakoni made love to sister! ? What is monkey saying? friend spoke. ? He is saying Arakoni made love to sister! Then Arakoni spoke: ? I go away. When he go away spoke to his friend: ? I go away, then you make Kwarup, mother does not want to give food anymore, burnt my arrow, burnt my necklace. I go away. Then Arakoni painted himself in order to become "bicho" (7). Then Arakoni become "bicho". Went away there in Morena. This happened there old Waura village [ called ] Tsarwapuhe (points to the South). Then mother cried a lot. Asked Arakoni to return. ? Come back Arakoni! You can make love to your sister. But Arakoni does not hear anymore [ he ] is there in Morena. He was the first who drew Ualamd neptako, Kulupeiene, Kupdte ndbe, Sapalakd, Kuarrdta, Uene Uene Suco, KunheKunhe, Rute Kana. It was Arakoni who taught music of "Kwarup". On another occasion I asked to be told again the same myth. It was repeated to me in an almost identical manner, but the ending did vary: "Then the Waura knows how to draw. Other tribes do not know. Because Arakoni is Waura. Others don't know make "mayako" (basket). Only Waura know make "mayako". My informant advised me to ask other Waura to draw me Arakoni's drawings; at that time I had already asked several people to draw mythological personages, and, according to Wayeru, the drawing would make me understand the story better. And this really did happen: thanks to the drawings of Arakoni I could distinguish the various motifs of Waura painting. Two informants (Laptauana and Apyka) drew very enlightening figures (plates 1 and 2). The relationship of the personage of Arakoni to the painting motifs becomes quite clear when the matter in which he is represented in drawings is analysed (plates 1 and 2). First of all, we find a repertoire of the painting motifs known to the Waura, which reduces to the simplest expression the depiction of the body of the personage. 7) "Bicho" (Apapaatae in Waura) - refers to both creatures of the animal and supernatural worlds. Sometimes also referred to as "espirito" (spirit).</page><page sequence="6">240 Vera Penteado Coelho Each of the different painting motifs is designated by a specific name, as is indicated next to the figures. Although I did not obtain a detailed explanation with respect to the question, and although the inventory of motifs which I have started to make is far from complete, I nevertheless do not believe it is possible to make a distinction between the geometric and representational patterns of painting among the Waura. In my view, there is always a relationship between the series of figures (which to our eyes are only geometrical) which the Waura draw and the forms of the natural world, such as: fish bones, "sucuri" snakes' head, or with objects which are used, such as the uluri. (8) Plate 1 - The mythological personage of Arakoni, drawn by Apyka. In the lower plane can be seen an anthropomorphic figure and in the upper the personage after his transformation into a "bicho". His body is covered by a part of the decorative motifs known to the Waura. From left to right are depicted: Kupdte-Ndbe (Fish Bones), Kunhe'Kunhe' Rute (Butterfly Wing), Kupdte Rdta (Curitama Fish Scales), Kulupeiene (Translation Unknown), Eptakui (Translation Unknown), Kupdte Rdta (Fish Bones), Eptakui (Translation Unknown), Sapalacurtana (Uluri), Karrurrote Tapaca (Macaw's Eye), and last, Temepi-And (Snake Motif). Some of the motifs have names which could not be translated (Kulupeiene, for exam ple), but before we classify them as geometrical it is useful to verify that if the Waura do not see in them a correspondence with any of the forms of the objective world. In analysing the paintings found in a small collection which I gathered, and in com paring them with the drawings, one may find under the same designation, indifferently, lines, triangles or diamonds. What distinguishes one motif from another is not the occur rence of one or another of these figures, but the rythm of their repetition and the manner in which they are placed within a previously circumscribed space. Thence stems the fact that in Arakoni's drawings we find each of the motifs repeated once or more times: a single 8) Uluri - Small triangular ornament used on their belts by the women of the Upper Xingu.

As an example, in plates 1 and 2 can be seen different motifs constituted by a series of triangles: Temepi-and (pain ting of snake (Figure 1) and Kupdte rdta (fish scales or curimatd fish scales - as translations vary), Temepi-and is drawn twice and consists of friezes of triangles joined at their vertices (Fig. 1) whereas in Kupdte rdta (Fig. 2) the vertices of the triangles of the lower series touch the base of the triangles of the upper series. The principle which governs the Kupdte rdta pattern is that of suggesting the idea of imbrication, which characterizes the curimatd fish scales. Fig. 2 - Kupdte-Rdta (Curitamd Fish Scales) Fig. 3 - Ualamd Neptakd (Sucuri Snake's Head) In the small sampling of painting motifs which I managed to gather, the Ualamd nep takd pattern (sucuri snake's head) (Fig. 3) is represented few times: it could be seen in two ceramics pots and in drawings. Thus the interpretation which I am suggesting is provi sional and its confirmation will depend on light to be shed by new materials to be obtained in field work. It would seem that this motif is intimately related with Temepi-and. As in the Temepi-and, the triangles are adjacent to each other and we will find that in the intervals between four adjacent triangles the figure of a diamond will appear. The figure therefore consists of triangles, whereas the background is formed by a diamond. In Ualamd neptakd we have the same motif of the Temepi-and, but, here background and figure are inverted: it is the diamonds which form the figure, while the triangles become the background. With the result that we have a motif composed by various diamonds joined by the vertices. This interpretation was suggested by Shepard "Ceramics for the Archeologist" who studied the visual effect of background and figure in the decoration of ceramics pots (Shepard, 1971:286,7).</page><page sequence="9">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians 243 There is still another couple of motifs which also are distinguished by the use of triangles: Kinkerre tiand (Fig. 4), also called KunheKunhe Rute kana, (painting of the but terfly) and Sapalacurtana, also called Sapalako (uluri) (Fig. 5). In these two patterns the triangles are not disposed in friezes, but constitute groups: in Sapalacurtana we have groups of triangles apposed by the base and in Kinkerre tiand the line of juncture is given starting at the right angle: in both motifs the triangles are apposed two by two, in such a manner that the line between them is that which forms the right angle. In Karrurrote tapaca (painting of the macaw) the analogy to the real model is of great interest: this pattern of painting does not, in a general manner, reproduce the figure of the model which inspires it, but is limited to one of its characteristics which is, in this case, the reproduction of the parallel lines that macaws have around their eyes. This pattern can, therefore, be defined as " a series of parallel lines going in different directions". Fig. 4 - Kinkerre Tiand or Kunhe'Kunhe' Rute Kana (Painting of Butterfly) The translation of the expression Kupdte ndbe, the name of a very frequently used painting pattern, is fish bone. Some examples of objects decorated with this motif appear, in fact, to reproduce this figure. In its simplest expression Kupdte ndbe can be seen as a series of parallel lines forming obtuse angles in relation to a common bisector, (see Fig. 6). In other words, there is a straight line dividing the decorative area in two equal halves. In the upper half there is a series of parallel diagonal lines, directed towards the top, to the right of the decorative area; in the lower half there is another series of lines directed towards the bottom, also to the right of the decorative area. These are not, however, the only ways to paint the Kupdte ndbe. In other figures we can see more clearly the principle which defines this pattern; in these we find a line which divides the decorative area in a horizontal direction, where the figures shown above this area are reproduced in the lower half in an inverted manner (Fig. no. 7). The definition of Kupdte ndbe as a painting pattern</page><page sequence="10">244 Vera Penteado Coelho appears therefore to be the inversion of figures placed in adjacent decorative areas. None of my informants knew how to translate the expression Kulupeiene, the name of one of the motifs used most frequently among the Waura. In the collection which I gathered, the decorative pieces showing this motif, happily, were very numerous, there being examples on pottery, as well as on wood (paddles to flip "beiju", sticks to dig manioc), a basket and several drawings of baskets, as well as photographs of young men showing the pattern in body painting. The principle of this pattern appears to be that of symmetry between two equidistant figures in the decorative area. The figures which comprise it can either appear in horizontal friezes, within a quadrangle, or in radially symmetrical patterns (Figures 8, 9, 10). Fig. 9 - Kulupeiene (Translation Unknown) Fig. 10 - Kulupeiene (Translation Unknown) I will not attempt an exhaustive analysis of all the motifs collected on this field trip; however, it is possible to note through the above examples that in order to distinguish these, the rhythm with which they are ordered and the order in which they are placed within the space are more important than the figures themselves. As can be seen through these examples, there is a certain relation, although very slight, among the patterns used in Waura painting and nature. In the paintings with names related to the animal world, one of the characteristics of the model is chosen in order to represent it (in the majority of cases it is only a detail). A typical case is that of the macaw, represented by the black lines around its eyes. We did not find a single depiction of a zoomorphic figure showing an entire body and had we not had an explanation regarding</page><page sequence="11">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians 245 each of the painting motifs, we would have never been able to connect them with a being of the real world. One finds in painting several examples of the reformulation of parts of the figures of the real world by always geometrizing the body of animals or by focusing only on the geometrical portion of their body, and then repeating it at regular intervals within a circumscribed space. In light of more thorough studies of decoration motifs, it would be interesting to cast in a different frame the question of Waura art in particular and Xingu art in general. Up to now, the discussions around this theme have been permeated by one dominant question: whether or not one is dealing with figurative art and what is the meaning of the constituent elements. Special attention has been paid to the question of knowing whether the triangle or the diamond represents an uluri and/or a pacu fish. Gerbrands (1957:32-35) summarizes the discussions and places them in a theoretical perspective within the history of anthropology. In order to arrive at more conclusive results, it seems to me that one should turn to a deeper formal analysis of decorative patterns. Wolfflin has stated in connection with western art that "a picture owes much more to other pictures than to the observation of nature on the part of the artist" (cited by Hauser, 1978:412), and Malraux expands this line of thought by suggesting that "art is not merely a rival of nature, but the very source of artistic inspiration and the main content of the work to be created." According to Malraux, an artist is interested only in his work: a composer does not seek to reproduce the song of the nightingale, but bases himself on other songs; the poet does not concern himself so much with dusks as with the beauty of verses, and "he who paints is not a lover of landscapes but of pictures" (cited by Hauser, 1978:412). Similar reflections are likewise applicable to the arts existing outside the western world. A treatise on Chinese painting sums up the teachings to the young by emphasizing the need to first study the works of the great masters and, afterwards, embark on an obser vation of nature, and only then depict what has been seen, transposing to the work of art the objective world through the prism of the tradition inherited from the art of predecessors. The relationship between art and the objective world is too complex a problem to be dealt with in a brief paper such as this. The observation of the objective world does not always provide the key to understanding the artistic repertory of the Waura. Finding in spiration in the figures of the real world, Waura art represents them in a highly sophisticated and conventionalized manner, departing significantly from its models, with which it retains few similarities. So far, I have concerned myself with the motifs used in Waura painting. The same conventionalization is also found in the animal figures appearing on pottery: the tri dimensional rendering of a certain animal and the adaptation of its figure to the shape of a pot requires, first of all, that it be reduced to a simpler expression - which means, in most cases, that the body will be omitted and that only the head, the tail and sometimes the legs will appear in the piece. The key to distinguish which animal is being represented will be (as is the case in painting) a small distinctive detail of its appearance. The representation of a coati, for instance, is characterized by a striped tail, that of the acari fish by a small cir cular depression beneath the head, that of a bull by horns, and so forth. This type of convention can lead to numerous ambiguities and misinterpretations: the representation of an animal with a protruding snout may be interpreted either as an anteater or a tapir; it is difficult to tell for sure the representation of a water turtle from</page><page sequence="12">246 Vera Penteado Coelho that of a land turtle, just to give a few examples. When this happens (and ambiguities com monly occur in zoomorphic representations), the artist's opinion will provide the final ver dict on the meaning of the representation. By the way, when I was observing the potters of the village modelling their pieces and other Waura approached to watch and comment on the work, their first question was: -Katsa kana kataha? (literal translation: What (suffix designating zoomorphic vessels) this?). In other words: -Which animal are you depicting? This question would not come up if the language of the shapes were absolutely clear. The need to seek clarification with the potter goes to prove that even to the Indians of the same tribe a given figure may cause doubt. In order to clarify certain aspects of the question of the identification of zoomorphic figures, I asked several informants to draw animals which are depicted in pottery. Even when new and diverse resources were available-such as, for instance, several colors-the animal figures drawn by the Waura were as difficult to identify as the ones molded in clay, and posed the same ambiguities I had noticed in ceramics. During my stay in the field, I us ed to keep the drawings in a folder which everyone liked to open and handle, and in this situation the question of what they represented inevitably was asked. At one time, when I was visiting the house of one of my pottery teachers, Makit sapaielo, she asked me to see the drawings the others had made. She became enthusiastic over two representations of tapirs drawn by Atamai ((plate 3) and asked me what drawing was that. I answered and she then borrowed it as a model and copied it on a vessel (plate 4). Plate 3 - Drawing of two tapirs made by Atamai. When this drawing was shown to Makitsapaielo, one of the most experienced potters of the village, she used it as a model for one of her pots. As occurs in ceramics, drawings do not constitute a self-sufficient language and always must be explained by the author in order to be identified. At this point, a parenthetical remark would be in order, for some confusion exists among scholars regarding the graphic representations of primitive peoples, specially representations of the animal world. Undeniably, there exists among such peoples a very profound knowledge of nature and they have developed classification systems much more</page><page sequence="13">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians 247 refined than ours~a question brilliantly handled by Levi-Strauss in the first chapter of the classic "La Pensee Sauvage". But confusion arises when one wants to see in Indian art a faithful reflection of the knowledge of nature, as if scientific knowledge entailed an ac curate ability for graphic or plastic representation. Faithful representation of nature and scientific knowledge do not always go hand in hand. By way of illustration, one may con sider the drawings made by adults with a scientific background reproduced by Herskovits (1963:208-209). The clearly primary character of the figures reveals that there is an enor mous gap between the knowledge of an object and the ability to represent it in an accep table manner. Plate 4 - Ceramic pot representing a tapir (in Waura Teme-Kene) executed by Makitsapaielo in ac cordance with the model shown on Plate 3. And if the work of art is many times executed in the presence of a model, this does not substantially alter the conventional nature of representation. I was able to verify this fact in the field when one of the potters, Muri, made a pot with the figure of a coati {plate 5). As I had done before, I asked other informants to draw coatis so that I could compare the various representations. One afternoon when several Indians had gathered in the men's house, Ualama offered to draw a coati (plate 6). As usual when this type of work was to be started, he sat on a trunk serving as a bench and drew on the ground with his finger the outline of the figure. He then picked two pencils from the set of colored pencils~for this project he selected two colors: pink for the body of the animal and black for the outline of the figure and details. After he had already begun his drawing, he remembered that there was a recently caught coati in his house; he interrupted his work which was half done to fetch the model. The animal had already been grilled (the Waura like to eat their meat very well done) and, to a certain extent, had been twisted out of shape by the heat of the fire, with the surface totally blackened. This, however, did not alter the designer's original in tention to use pink as the predominant color for the figure. As the drawing progressed, all men present helped themselves to bits of the model, so much so that when the drawing was completed there remained only some bones scattered here and there on the ground. The result was a zoomorphic figure with a protruding snout, four paws and a striped tail. If one were to ask me to identify the animal without knowing the intention of the artist, I certain ly would say it was an alligator, due to the long projecting nose. But the striped tail and, above all, the intention of the designer determined a different interpretation of the figure.</page><page sequence="14">248 Vera Penteado Coelho This episode called to memory a plate from "Art and Illusion'' by Gombrich (1956: 78-79) which shows the figure of a lion and a porcupine drawn by Villard de Honnecourt. The figure, which has little in the way of realism, was, according to the author himself, drawn using a live model, which did not add a trace of veracity to it.

Its most remarkable characteristics from the Waura point of view, the alongated shape of the snout and the lines painted on the tail, should be noted. The shape of the pot is also of interest, as it is a native version of the aluminum pots used by whites. Plate 6 - Drawing of a coati made by Ualama. The colors used were pink for the body and black for the details. I do not mean to say that no comparison with the objective world should be made when one studies the zoomorphic repertory of Waura pottery. But more than a model to be copied, the figures in the real world constitute a point of reference to be reinterpreted, abbreviated and, in many cases, presented in a way beyond the recognition of people who, like us, are used to dealing with a particular set of conventions. Therefore, if it is necessary to make a comparison between the figures and their models, it is even more important to compare the figures depicted in several objects made out of different materials. It will then be noticed that the same principles of simplification and stylization of zoomorphic figures govern the different representations; they will be found in the paddles to flip beiju, in the sticks to unearth manioc and in the drawings made by the Waura. In the artifacts made of wood (as for instance paddles and sticks), the reper tory is different from that of pottery; here one also sees that the zoomorphic figures con stitute only a small appendage which does not interfere with the shape of the instrument.</page><page sequence="15">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians 249 In the drawings, the bodies of the various animals are represented in very similar ways: the animals are represented in pairs and the colors follow, mutatis mutandis, the same recurr ing patterns prevailing in pottery painting. The interpretation of the zoomorphic figures which appear in pottery is related to the repertory of animals that can be represented. When asking a potter which figure he is molding, a Waura, even if he ignores the answer he will get, will know beforehand that it will be given from among a certain number of limited possibilities. In the first place, there are certain animals that play a major role in mythology and, for this reason, are never the object of representation in pottery. As interesting as the list of animals that can be represented is the list of animals whose representation is seen with repulsion. One after noon I was talking with Atamai, one of the few Waura who could speak Portugese very well and who, therefore, was in a position to provide information of great interest. I started to ask him why one could not make pots with the figures of certain animals of the local fauna, when he seemed to feel quite uncomfortable. Although he did not refuse to answer my questions, he became evasive and always dodged the real answers by skillfully changing the subject whenever the conversation took a turn he thought undesirable. Without ever ceasing to smile and maintaining his courteous manner, he gave answers which lacked the objectivity always present when less compelling subjects were being discussed. Thus, for instance, when I asked why one could not represent a hummingbird on pottery, he answered that it was impossible because it is such a small animal; obviously, this is not a very plausible answer, since beetles are a rather frequent motif. (On a later occasion, another informant, Tauapa, told me that Captain Malakuyawa was once attacked by the spirit of a hummingbird, which made him ill for a very long time, and he only escaped death because he was such a great shaman and had powers to ward off the evil. According to FUNAI workers, Malakuyawa's illness was measles, which at the time had become epidemic in Xingu, causing serious trouble to everyone.) When I asked why one could not represent the figure of a jaguar, Atamai, instead of answering me, went on to list the animals which can be represented in pottery and right after that explained how dangerous tobacco is to women, with the clear intention of avoiding a sub ject which was becoming embarassing to him. I did not press the matter too hard so as not to gain a forced entrance into a domain in which my curiosity certainly was not welcome. Anyhow, it is possible to see clearly that there are reasons far moreserious than mere technical requirements and aesthetic preferences to pre vent certain representations. I was able to put together a small list-certainly not comprehensive~of animals whose representation is forbidden in pottery. In addition to the hummingbird, one may not make pots depicting jaguars, snakes, wild pigs and dogs. According to Atamai, these are the animals the Waura do not find beautiful; as he put it, there are many ugly animals and only when the Waura consider an animal beautiful do they reproduce its figure on pots. The word for "beautiful" (aurrepdi in Waura) designates those objects which are technically well made and well finished. Krauere, one of the three best flutists in the village, only considered a flute (which I had received as a gift from a friend of mine) to be aurrepdi after he had carefully remodelled it, widening the holes with a penknife and altering the &lt;&lt;cerol,,(9) that surrounded the mouthpiece. In other words, aurrepdi is the quality of the 9) "cerol" - wax paste used, among other things, to close the mouthpiece of flutes.</page><page sequence="16">250 Vera Penteado Coelho well-tuned flute which is ready to be played on. When used to designate a "quality of a per son", the word aurrepdi indicates good-tempered, jolly individuals, particularly those who never become cross or angry-which for the Waura is an ideal one must seek to attain. The op posite of aurrepdi in this context is nukapai or peyetepei (angry)~a character type undesirable and detestable par excellence. I have an incomplete list of animals deemed to be "beautiful" by the Waura and which can be represented in pottery. In the words of Atamai, the beautiful animals that can be modelled are the following: crab, cascudo fish, deer, tapir, armadillo, dove, toad (aiussi in Waura), anteater, "a fish with a long bill like duck's bill" (sic), water turtle, land turtle, ray, rooster, coati, "a white bird like a hawk with a tail like this (forked) but is not a hawk" (akuna in Waura),pacu fish, alligator, paca, capuchin monkey, lizzard (mayuwd in Waura), bat. As mentioned earlier, this is a partial list. The verbal information of the Waura is not always very precise and, going over the museum collections or even the sets of works in progress in the village, one realizes that the repertory of the Waura is much broader. There are a couple of important omissions in Atamai's roll: cattle {plate 7)-undeniably a recent innovation for it is neither mentioned in previous papers nor represented in any of the museum collections I examined--, beetle, curassow, owl, cotia, Brazilian otter, just to name a few examples. Plate 7 - Ceramics pot representing a bull. There is no Waura word to designate it. This shape is an in novation in the Waura repertoire of pottery and was introduced recently. Curiously enough, Atamai added to his list of animals the canoe~the sole inanimate object found in the pottery repertory. It is perhaps possible to relate this fact to the myth of origin of the Waura (Schultz, 1964: 21-38), in which a bat engages in sexual intercourse with the daughter of a jatobd tree. The union gives rise to several events, the most signifi cant being the origin of the Waura. The importance of the jatobd tree must be great indeed for its trunk is used to make canoes, which, to all indication, are not included in the category of common objects. The other important innovation which was introduced in Waura pottery not long ago is called makulatain yerepuekana (plate 8), an expression that can be translated as "little pan from grandpa's time." This motif reproduces in a more or less accurate manner the pottery fragments which are being discovered at Ipavu lake, next to the village of the Kamayura, in the Xingu National Park.</page><page sequence="17">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians 251 In a subsequent paper, I intend to compare the animal repertory of the various collec tions gathered among the Waura at different points in time: it will then be possible to determine if certain animals?such as bats and alligators?are the object of constant preferences, whereas others-such as parakeets and parrots-constitute a momentary predilection and are forgotten later on. The taste for novelty among the Waura is remarkable: the photographs of the pots collected by von den Steinen, Pedro Lima and Schultz (which had almost completely vanished from memory) aroused great interest; in fact, these pictures were the subject of long conversations and were many times reinter preted by my informants. Plate 8 - Ceramics pot called makulatain Yerepue-Kana in Waura. An expression which was translated as "pot of the time of grandpa" and which was visibly inspired in the archeological fin dings at the Ipavu lake, near the Kamayura village. By way of illustration, I have listed the animals which Tauapa, one of the experienced ceramists of the village, knew how to make, as well as the innovations he introduced after he saw the photographs of the Waura pots with which I was working before my trip. Tauapa said he could model the following shapes: water turtle, tapir, bat, land turtle, dove, akuna (a bird similar to a hawk), pacu fish, alligator, ray, toad {kartukalo in Waura), capibara, monkey (pahu in Waura), jaguar, another monkey (kapulo in Waura), anteater, fox (awaulu in Waura), yula (translation not available), lizzard (mayuwd in Waura), deer, horse, another animal that looks like a horse and which does not exist in Xingu (he saw it in Sao Paulo when he was there undergoing medical treatment-its name in Waura is yutakumakana, which translates approximately as "pot in the shape of deer ancestor or deer spirit,,)&gt; bird (makana kana in Waura), curassow, hen, another bird (malahli in Waura), another bird (kuyuy in Waura), a fish that looks like a ray (tupaiu in Waura), pirarara fish, a fish like the acari fish (wakd in Waura), a bird that looks like a duck (upi in Waura), another duck (upikuma in Waura), cat, toad (aiussi), macuco bird, bird (macucawa in Waura), another bird (ulusd in Waura), another bird like ulusa (unkard in Waura), another bird like a duck (kapu-kapu in Waura). What draws one's immediate attention in this list is the fact that it includes an animal which Atamai said the Waura do not like-the jaguar-as well as other animals which I never came across at the village or in the pottery collections in the museums, namely, cat,</page><page sequence="18">252 Vera Penteado Coelho horse and yutakumd. Perhaps, as is the case with the information given by Atamai, there are small discrepancies between the verbal reports and the empirical reality. In addition to that, the taste for novelty is enormous and Tauapa always seemed to be very much in terested in expanding the limits of his repertory. Therefore, at the time of my departure he asked me to give him as a gift some photographs of pots belonging to museum collections. I complied with his request but suggested that he pick the ones he liked best, as it was im possible to give him the entire collection. To my surprise, he chose five zoomorphic pots out of which only one was not in his repertory. I believe he was not so interested in reper tory as in the manner in which the animals were represented. He chose the following pic tures: von den Steinen collection VB 2974 (tick), VB 2999 (bat)k; Schultz collection RG 11608 (curassow), RG 11630 (curassow), RG 11600 (monkey). The idea that it had once occured to a Waura to represent in a pot the figure of a tick seemed to Tauapa exceedingly ludicrous. However, instead of rejecting what to him was a considerable innovation, he preferred to adopt it and incorporate it to his repertory. On this and on several other occasions, Tauapa displayed in high degree what, among us, is known as "scientific mind". This example clearly illustrates that there are variations in repertory in the course of time and that the memory of some zoomorphic pieces is lost after a few generations. In this case as well as in others, I was able to observe that the identification of photographs of animals represented in pottery is quite variable. Since conventions are not clear-cut, the figures are reduced to their most distinctive features and there are numerous discrepancies between the identifications collected by anthropologists who worked among the Waura on previous occasions and those I obtained for photographs of the same pieces. Here one must take into account a problem much too complex to be dealt with in this paper, but which cannot go unmentioned: the question of knowing to what extent the Waura understand the reality that is distorted by the limitations of photography. This pro blem cannot be investigated in a brief work such as this, but it should be mentioned that, since a photograph cannot record the entire volume of a pottery piece, it omits the very detail which, for the Waura, is fundamental to characterize the animal represented in the piece. The flexibility with which zoomorphic figures and painting patterns are interpreted leads to a number of reflections on questions which go beyond the scope of the present paper; I have in mind, particularly, the question of archaeological materials. During my stay at the Waura village, I was able to verify on a great many occasions that I should not attempt to interpret the representations of the figures I saw, because my standards of inter pretation were totally different from those prevailing among the Indians. Fortunately, they corrected my mistakes and always explained what the true interpretation was. These am biguities posed by representations should be taken into account by scholars who work with extinct cultures for it is often seen that one wants to apply to such cultures a code of inter pretation that is only meaningful within the context of our culture.</page><page sequence="19">Some Aspects of the Pottery of the Waura Indians 253 Acknowledgements Field work for this paper was made possible by the following: a grant from the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), which contributed half of the cost of the expedition; the help of the then Commander of the Fourth Aerial Zone of Sao Paulo, Brigadeiro Clovis Pavan, the Brazilian Air Force which provided transportation to the Posto Indigena Leonardo Villas Boas and delivered packages and correspondence during the stay; the then Director of the National Park of the Xingu, Pro fessor Olimpio Serra and his wife, Dr. Zelia Serra, whose hospitality and precious infor mation regarding the Waura were invaluable. The drawings which illustrate the paper were made by Pedro Vaz de Arruda, a student at the Fundagao Armando Alvares Penteado, and were based on the decorative motifs of the ceramics pieces, wood and drawings made by the Indians, as well as on the field notes of the author. The photographs were taken by Mr. Romulo Fialdini. The necessary leave of absence to carry out the field work was granted by the Paulista Museum of the University of Sao Paulo. Ms. Irene Feldman and Mr. Manoel Vidal are responsible for the English translation of the original version of this paper. Dr. Monte Kenaston, from Memphis State University made interesting suggestions about this paper. Dr Gunther Hartmann provided me a com plete set of copies of von den Steinen's drawings of Waura pottery. To these persons and institutions our sincere thanks are hereby extended.
