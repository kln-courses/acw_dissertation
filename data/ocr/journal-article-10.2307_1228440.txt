But I also believe-and this is the implicit theme of every page of this essay-that the topic of corporate social responsibility cannot be debated except against the background of a general political theory. The resolution of nearly every issue of cor- porate social responsibility depends heavily on one's beliefs about how our political process operates and one's convictions about the ideal political process.

The assumptions that generate this model, and my reasons for believing it is worthwhile to write an essay based on them, should be identified immediately. I am going to assume a legislative process that is politically legiti- mate-except insofar as legitimacy is thrown into question by the political role of the particular corporation itself.7 I will assume that the measures coming out of the legislative process either accurately reflect the political will of the relevant constituencies-on the basis of facts known-or may be taken to reflect that will because of a widely shared acceptance of legitimacy. What is perhaps more extreme, I will assume that, at least in the long run, even legislative inaction should be taken to reflect political consensus-a consensus that noth- ing should be done about a particular matter. Only in terms of shortrun lags will I question this assumption. While I will thus, arbitrarily, be excluding from consideration a variety of real imperfections in lawmaking, I do not propose to ex- clude consideration of the difficulties that may hamper the legisla- ture's effort to attach an effective remedy to any given rule. Such difficulties will in fact be a large part of my topic. But even here, I will adopt the restrictive assumption that the only reliable indicator of legislative will is legislative adoption of, or failure to adopt, reme- dies. Unavoidable remedial costs or failures may well make this indi- cator itself imperfect; but no other reliable indicator is available. This essay may, therefore, be viewed as a kind of abstraction of the topic of corporate social responsibility. The reader who traces the impact of these assumptions through the essay should emerge wondering how Messrs. Nader and Stone, and for that matter their direct antagonists in the corporate social responsibility debate,8 can pretend to discuss corporate social responsibility without having ar- ticulated an underlying political philosophy. If the essay leaves most of its readers wondering this, I think I will have been justified in taking off from such an artificial starting point. Such further justification as I have lies in two related observa- tions. First, my assumptions are, we will see, if anything less artificial than those implicitly adopted by a number of writers about corpo- rate social responsibility; insofar as my assumptions actually accord with one's view of the political process, some of the analysis that fol- 7.

Second, this essay may be viewed throughout as simply an illustration of just how political as- sumptions shape one's thinking about corporate social responsibility. Different assumptions would unquestionably produce different ana- lytic results; but only assumptions so radically different as to be cer- tainly a minority American view need produce a different kznd of analysis.9 I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY The people who say they are discussing corporate social responsi- bility are by no means all interested in the same questions, and they often seem to be talking past each other.'0 It seems to me, for reasons I will develop in a moment, that the basic question of corporate so- cial responsibility is not whether we wish to compel or forbid certain kinds of corporate conduct by legislative command, for example, but rather whether it is socially desirable for corporations organized for profit voluntarily to identify and pursue social ends where this pur- suit conflicts with the presumptive shareholder desire to maximize profit. I will, simply as a convention, refer to any such corporate activity as a form of voluntarzsm or altruism. I will not, quite, be trying to answer the question of whether cor- porate altruism is socially desirable-much less whether it is desira- ble enough to warrant the costs of, for example, the much debated proposals for public interest director systems intended to encourage it.11 I will be satisfied if I can provide a clarifying framework through which to approach the question. Indeed, what I hope my suggested framework will make clear above all is that the question of whether corporate voluntarism is desirable cannot be answered in general terms.12 Rather, the question to ask, analytically and empiri- cally, is whether corporate voluntarism in particular areas of substan- tive conduct has the potential on net to be socially desirable.13 9. Among other things, this refers to the fact that I will assume continued private own- ership of the means of production. 10.

One of the greatest failings on both sides of the corporate social responsibility debate so far seems to me to be that, even when the social desirability or undesirability of corporate voluntarism is not merely assumed, it tends to be treated as an all-or-nothing question. 13.

Phelps ed. 1975).</page><page sequence="4">4 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 What I hope to provide in this essay, then, is a framework for asking this particularized question. The cumulative answers to this question, across a range of types of substantive conduct, can ulti- mately define the net benefits one might hope to gain from encourag- ing corporate voluntarism. The various possible means of encouraging voluntarism-such as a system of public interest direc- tors-would each in turn impose institutional and other costs that would need to be weighed against these net benefits. But we should not engage in a discussion of means until we are clear that the ends are desirable, and we will get nowhere if we do not ask the question of ends with some precision. If we do ask it precisely, our results will illuminate not only whether a public interest director system in par- ticular would be likely to justify its probable costs, but will illuminate also the potential value of any proposed institutional reform in- tended to spur corporate voluntarism-and, indeed, the potential value of the corporate voluntarism that is already engaged in by managements as now constituted.14 My attempt at constructing an analytic framework will occupy Parts IV through VIII of the essay. In Part IV, I will identify and try to defend a starting proposition for the analysis: Any act of corpo- rate voluntarism should be based on a broad, and clearly signalled, social consensus. Starting from this foundation, and from my more general assumptions,15 I will suggest in Parts V through VIII that corporate voluntarism seems unlikely to be socially desirable outside three particular areas of corporate conduct: (1) voluntary obedience of the law; (2) in a very few situations, probably most often at times of temporary social emergency, the voluntary sacrifice of operating profits when it is obvious that the gain to third parties will far exceed the loss of profits to the corporation; and (3) certain kinds of volun- tary corporate disclosure-and closely related to this, voluntary for- bearance from certain kinds of "interference" with government 14. If one defines corporate voluntarism as I will-to exclude all actions motivated by longrun corporate self-interest-then it is impossible for an outsider to judge how much of it now occurs. See text accompanying notes 30-32 zn/Ea. There are probably, at the very least, some cases of public corporations donating money to pet charities of the Chief Executive Officer or of his or her family. See Wall St. J., Apr. 13, 1979, at 4, col. 2 (describing Ford Motor Co. shareholder proposal to do away with all charitable contributions that do not further company's business interests). But the primary reason for proceeding with our analy- sis is not to evaluate such current cases; it is to help evaluate the proposed institutional re- forms meant to spur more voluntarism.

See text accompanying notes 7-9 supra.</page><page sequence="5">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 5 processes. 16 After an examination of each of these three most promising areas in turn (Parts VI, VII, and VIII of the essay), I think it will appear that, at least as things stand today (and working always from my starting assumptions), only the last of the three has any promise of justifying the social costs of compulsorily reforming corporate gov- ernance structure to spur more corporate voluntarism. That is, the proposals for mandatory public interest directors, or any other simi- lar reforms, can justify themselves, if at all, only by the contribution such reforms may make to spurring either (a) desirable, voluntary corporate disclosures, or (b) desirable, voluntary corporate absten- tions from interference with lawmaking processes. The social and economic desirability of these two subspecies of corporate voluntarism-disclosure, and abstention from interference with lawmaking-is an extremely complicated question and, again, the answer may vary with different types of disclosure and different 'ypes of interference with lawmaking. But since the essay will suggest that this is the question on which the corporate social responsibility debate should begin, I will try in Part VIII at least to identify some of the issues that are likely to arise in analyzing and empirically ex- amining this question.17 Finally, with the suggested framework set out, Part IX of the es- say will attempt to use that background to review and criticize the two most widely discussed books of recent years that purport to call for "more" corporate social responsibility-Christopher Stone's Where the Law Ends"8 and Taming the Giant Corporaton, by Ralph Na- der, Mark Green, and Joel Seligman.19 II. DEFINING THE AREA AND THE CENTRAL QUESTION: THE DESIRABILITY OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY A. Definzng the Area I think it would be helpful if there came into general use a limit- ing convention about the scope of the corporate social responsibility topic: The term is most useful if taken to denote the obligations and inclinations, if any, of corporations organized for profit, voluntarily 16. On the further question, also closely related, of corporations affirmatively and altru- istically lobbying for restrictive legislation, see text accompanying notes 302-04 bfira. 17.

Various parts of the framework I will develop have been suggested, with one or another degree of precision, by a number of other people. See, t.g., H. MANNE &amp; H.

PROB., Summer 1977, at 3; sources cited note 87 in/a. A number of writers have recognized the value of maintaining a precise definition of corporate social responsibility as corporate voluntarism. See, e.g., H. MANNE &amp; H. WALLICH, supra, at 3-8, 39-43 (lecture of Professor Manne; lecture of Professor Wallich); C. STONE, supra note 5, at 72-73, 113-16, 232-33, discussedat text accompanying notes 379-423 infra; Henning, Corporate Social Responsibitity: Shell Came for the Seventies?, in CORPORATE POWER IN AMERICA 151, 170 (R. Nader &amp; M. Green eds. 1973); Rostow, To Whom andfor What Ends Is Corporate Management Responsible?, in THE CORPORATION IN MODERN SOCIETY 46, 64 (E. Ma- son ed. 1959). Indeed, this is, in effect, the definition that framed the seminal debate almost 50 years ago between Professors Berle and Dodd. See note 26 infra. But we shall see that such a definition is by no means universally adhered to-even by those writers who seem to say that they endorse it. See, e.g., text accompanying notes 379-423 infra. 21. On the prevalence of this confusion in the writings of the proponents, see text ac- companying notes 343-423 infra. As a somewhat parallel example from the work of the oppo- nents, see Business Roundtable, The Role and Composition of the Board of Directors of the Large Publicly Owned Corporation, 33 Bus. LAW. 2083 (1978). This document starts with the following statement of its own purpose: "to analyze [the proper role of the board of directors] from the perspective of managers responsible for the effective performance of the economic functions of an enterprise andfor meeting other responsib'lities. Our objective is to discuss the board's role in carrying out both of these functions." Id. at 2085 (emphasis added). But the statement con- cludes that the board's only obligation to consider social impact-beyond obligations of obe- dience to law, id at 2101-02-"arises out of the responsibility to act primarily in the interest of the share owners-particularly their long-range interest." Id at 2100. For another exam- ple of such confusion in the work of the opponents, see Investment Company Institute, Corpo- rate Responsibility and Mutual Funds (Oct. 14, 1971). 22. A. BERLE &amp; G.

Shareholders in publicly held corporations, as a body and in their capacity as shareholders, show little inclination to give away any part of the store.25 In fact, the relationship between the two issues is more one of conflict than of overlap:26 Social voluntarism by corporations 23. 15 U.S.C. ?? 78a-78kk (1976) (original version at ch. 404, 48 Stat. 881 (1934)). 24. For evidence of the continuing attraction of scholars to this issue, see, e.g., M. EISEN- BERG, THE STRUCTURE OF THE CORPORATION (1976); Cary, Federalism and Corporate Law. Rejflctions Upon Delaware, 83 YALE L.J. 663 (1974); Winter, State Law, Shareholder Protection, and the Theoy ofthe Corporation, 6 J. LEGAL STUD. 251 (1977). 25. Even the strongest proponents of "more" corporate social responsibility admit that shareholders invariably and overwhelmingly vote down proxy proposals opposed by manage- ment-including proposals that purport to seek a greater degree of corporate voluntarism. See, e.g., Dahl, Governzng the Giant Corporation, in CORPORATE POWER IN AMERICA 10, 15 (R. Nader &amp; M. Green eds. 1973); Schwartz, Towards New Corporate Goals: Co-Existence With Soci- et, 60 GEO. L.J. 57, 63-64 (1971); Investor Responsibility Research Center, Inc., The 1978 Proxy Season: How Institutions Voted on Shareholder Resolutions and Management Pro- posals 3-4, 103-05 (Sept. 1978). But see Soderquist &amp; Vecchio, Reconciling Shareholder's Rights and Corporate Responsibilty: New Guidelznesfor Management, 1978 DUKE L.J. 819, 837-40, 841. (However, while Soderquist and Vecchio present survey data that purport to show share- holder agreement that corporate decisions should reflect a balancing of "client-group" inter- ests, their questions addressed to the shareholders do not seem to have made clear that the shareholders were being asked about sacrificing even long term profits. See id at 840 n.98, 844). Even when the proponents wish to point to "astounding" electoral successes, they come up with examples of percentage votes that would hardly be deemed encouraging in any other political context. See, e.g., B. LONGSTRETH &amp; H. ROSENBLOOM, CORPORATE SOCIAL RE- SPONSIBILITY AND THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR 14-15 (1973); Schwartz, supra, at 75. But see Wall St. J., Apr. 24, 1979, at 4, col. 2 (shareholder proposal to halt all construction and design of nuclear plants by Detroit Edison Co. receives nearly 10% of annual meeting vote in wake of Three Mile Island accident). The proponents frequently claim that the receipt of any substantial percentage of proxies, or even publicity in the absence of proxies, can be a kind of victory because of public pressures ultimately generated to modify corporate conduct. See, e.g., Schwartz, supra, at 82-84, 97. But such a claim neither constitutes nor is intended as an argument that shareholders themselves behave altruistically. See note 36 in.fa. Finally, some proponents hint on occasion that evidence of shareholder voluntarism might be stronger if institutional investors were forced to pass voting rights through to benefi- cial owners. See, e.g., R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp; J. SELIGMAN, supra note 6, at 128-29. But see Schwartz, supra, at 74 (disclaiming any literal passthrough device as impossibly cumbersome). But there seems to be little evidence to support this belief; and a passthrough of rights could not, realistically, turn the small minority votes now obtained by almost all public interest proxy proposals into anything more than slightly larger minority votes. Indeed, the peculiari- ties of centralized institutional voting are more often seen as the best hope than as the worst enemy of public interest proposals. See, eg., Chirelstein, supra note 10, at 63-64. 26. Yet a third possible relationship is also sometimes suggested. This is that the pas- siveness of the shareholder in the typical publicly held corporation "place[s] the community</page><page sequence="8">8 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 may quite reasonably be viewed as a specialized class of suboptimiza- tion by professional management.27 And once the relationship be- tween the two issues is thus viewed, it is so far from an identity28 that one senses something disingenuous, on both sides of the debate, about the way the two subjects keep getting confused with each other.29 in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not alone the owners or the con- trol [group] but all society." A. BERLE &amp; G. MEANS, THE MODERN CORPORATION AND PRIVATE PROPERTY 312 (rev. ed. 1967). See, e.g., C. STONE, supra note 5, at 232-33; Hether- ington, Fact and Legal Theory: Shareholders, Managers, and Corporate Social Responsibi/qy, 21 STAN. L. REV. 248, 274 (1969). The divorce of ownership and control is seen as somehow releasing us to consider issues more properly described as questions of corporate social responsibility. The argument is at best vague. See Demsetz, Socal ResponsibiAlt zn the Enterprise Economy, 10 Sw. U.L. REV. 1, 10-11 (1978). Moreover, even though the argument is generally traced to an origin in Berle and Means, Professor Berle himself, in his famous debate with Professor Dodd, refused to endorse any change in the legal or economic order based merely on the argument. See Berle, For Whom Corporate Managers Are Trustees. A Note, 45 HARV. L. REV. 1365, 1367-69 (1932). And despite what was widely heralded as his later conversion to Pro- fessor Dodd's view, see, e.g., A. BERLE, THE 20TH CENTURY CAPITALIST REVOLUTION 169 (1954), Professor Berle never seemed comfortable in the enemy camp. See, e.g., Berle, Foreword to THE CORPORATION IN MODERN SOCIETY at ix, xii (E. Mason ed. 1959). For a general discussion of these points and of the Berle and Dodd debate, see Katz, Responsibilit' and the Modem Corporation, 3 J.L. &amp; ECON. 75, 76-78 (1960). For the Berle and Dodd debate, see Berle, Corporate Powers as Powers zn Trust, 44 HARV. L. REV. 1049 (1931); Dodd, For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?, 45 HARV. L. REV. 1145 (1932); Berle, For Whom Corporate Manag- ers Are Trustees. A Note, 45 HARV. L. REV. 1365 (1932); Dodd, Is Effecve Enforcement of the Fiduciary Duties of Corporate Managers Practicable?, 2 U. CHI. L. REV. 194 (1935). In any event, even if there is anything to the argument that the divorce of ownership and control frees us to ask for corporate social responsibility, it can Qnly raise the issue. It throws no light on the desirability of corporate social responsibility. Therefore, this rather special relationship between problems of corporate social responsibility and problems of dis- franchised ownership need not concern us further. 27. Professional management may be management either as now constituted or as re- constituted after structural reforms intended to increase management's tendency towards al- truism. See texts accompanying notes 37-44, 93-100 znfra. 28. See Chirelstein, supra note 10, at 48-49. While a large part of our own inquiry will necessarily concern the apparent conflict between the two plausible social goals mentioned in text-management sensitivity to shareholder wishes and management's inclination to pursue social ends even when in conflict with profit maximization-the facts remain that (1) most instances of management suboptimization are not and could not very well be disguised as any kind of altruism; and (2) many of the problems raised by the topic of corporate social respon- sibility, although they could not arise if managements of public corporations were perfectly sensitive to shareholder preferences, are unique to that topic and have no counterparts when management suboptimizes in more mundane ways. In short, the topic of corporate social responsibility is best defined and examined as a subject quite distinct from that of general management insensitivity to the profit motive. 29. Proponents of corporate voluntarism often seem to be seeking the respectability of the very different Berle and Means "responsibility" tradition. See Winter, supra note 24, at 291. And opponents seem on occasion to enjoy the pretense that they have taken some action in response to the cries for voluntarism, when in fact the only action they are ready to take involves management accountability to investors. See note 21 supra. However, the opponents are more often rigorous about keeping the two subjects separate than are the proponents. See,</page><page sequence="9">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 9 My suggested definition of the corporate social responsibility topic is intended also to exclude a number of other, related issues, which are frequently mixed together under that heading-with re- sults primarily of confusion. Most obviously, a corporate action taken because of management's belief that it will maximize profits in the long run even if it may damage them this week or this year is not an action of social responsibility as we are using the term.30 Simi- larly, a public decision through the political process to modify the likely longrun consequences to the corporation of some action or in- action that management may be considering-as, for example, by making it illegal, so that management's calculus must include at least the odds and longrun detriment of getting caught-cannot be viewed as a political determination that we want "more" corporate social responsibility. It is merely a decision (whether wise or unwise) to enlist the profit motive in the service of a modified set of social goals.3" Similarly, a political decision by a particular constituency to exert some form of direct pressure-as by a boycott-on a corpora- tion to change its behavior is not a decision to press for corporate social responsibility. It is rather a private political attempt to enlist the profit motive in the service of new goals.32 e.g., H. MANNE &amp; H. WALLICH, supra note 20, at 3-5 (lecture of Professor Manne). But see note 93 zn.fra. On the relationship between the two issues as they show up in the pronounce- ments and actions of public officials, see note 58 znfra. 30. It is, of course, a question of degree whether a given corporate action, not justified in terms of short term profits, is motivated, in whole or in part, by an expectation that it will augment long term profits, or solely by a desire to do the right thing in the society even at some risk to long term profits. Certainly it is often impossible for an outsider to distinguish between these two classes of cases. See text accompanying notes 50-52 zn.fa. And, as a practi- cal matter, even management itself probably tends to believe that the two motivations are convergent. See note 93 zn.fa. But surely there are cases that clearly belong to one class or the other; and, even more surely, the two classes are conceptually distinct. This distinction is also drawn in H. MANNE &amp; H. WALLICH, supra note 20, at 4-5 (lecture of Professor Manne), in a passage that goes on to make in large part the argument I suggest in this paragraph of text. Other writers have also noted this obvious distinction. See, e.g., C. STONE, supra note 5, at 135-38; Dodd, For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?, supra note 26, at 1156. However, Professor Stone does not adhere rigorously to his own analytic catego- ries. See text accompanying notes 394-423 infra. 31. See, e.g., Baumol, supra note 20, at 49-52 ("change in the rules of the game . . . nothing voluntary"); Dodd, For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?, supra note 26, at 1152-53. In slightly different form, the same point can be made about legal rules or sanctions directed at "key" individuals within the corporation rather than at the corporation as a whole. See C. STONE, supra note 5, at 29. 32. See, e.g., Mundheim, A Comment on the Social Responsibilities of LVe Insurance Companies as Investors, 61 VA. L. REV. 1247, 1250-51 (1975).

The prime ex-</page><page sequence="10">10 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 Again, certain proposals to compel changes in corporate structure to increase corporate sensitivity to longrun profits-and more partic- ularly to the longrun profit consequences of substantive regulations, liability rules, and social pressures33-do not raise issues of corporate social responsibility as I have defined the term. Insofar as the pur- pose of such structural proposals is simply to protect shareholders against management shortsightedness-even if arguably it is a shortsighted- ness peculiarly prevalent in management's responses to regulatory measures or social activism34-the proposals are squarely in the Berle and Means tradition and are not part of our own topic. But beyond this, even where the proposals are conceived with the broader social purpose of giving bite to a variety of regulatory measures, consumer boycotts, and so forth, still the proposals have nothing to do with corporate voluntarism. Rather, they are suggestions of (a) compul- sory changes in structure, designed to make the corporation more aware of (b) a variety of external compulsions concerning particular substantive decisions.35 ample of such a hybrid is the mounting of a credible threat, by an individual constituency or by a coalition, to use governmental processes to change liability rules or regulatory prohibi- tions. If a corporation decides to "give" such constituencies some of what they want rather than to risk the results of their efforts in the political arena, there is no element of corporate social responsibility in that decision. See, e.g., Bronfenbrenner, supra note 20, at 177; note 263 inra; cf Chayes, The Modemn Corporahon and the Rule of Law, in THE CORPORATION IN MOD- ERN SOCIETY 25, 43-44 (E. Mason ed. 1959) (viewing automobile-dealer franchise legislation as example of "a more fruitful and complicated interaction between public authority and private response than the positivism of an undiluted regulatory approach"). 33. See note 36 infra (discussion of Professor Schwartz); text accompanying notes 346-423 bifra. 34. See C. STONE, supra note 5, at 39-46. 35. But see text accompanying notes 37-42 znfia. Even if a structural change were voluntarily adopted by the corporation to increase its sensitivity to its own longrun profit interests-and in particular its sensitivity to the effect on profits of regulation and social pressure-this would not be a matter of corporate social re- sponsibility. It would be, rather, just the kind of self-interested response to longrun external pressures that we have discussed. Indeed, the question quickly comes to mind: Once substan- tive external regulation or social pressure is applied, why cannot society safely leave it to the corporation itself to adopt the governance structure most likely to produce a profit-maximiz- ing response to the pressure? The more sophisticated of the proponents of compulsory struc- tural change, such as Professor Stone, raise this question on their own, and advance a number of plausible answers to it in defense of compulsory reform. See C. STONE, supra note 5, at 37-57, 137, 189; text accompanying notes 384-89 znfra. But, in any event, the superimposi- tion of a layer of structural compulsion, on top of layers of substantive regulation or social pressure, plainly does not convert a self-interested response into altruism. All these distinctions should be borne in mind when considering the particular topic of corporate disclosure. In a whole range of situations, the corporation must decide whether it should reveal, to the public or to shareholders, various data, experiences, and opinions avail- able in the first instance only to the corporation. Such corporate decisions whether or not to disclose-analyzed in conjunction with another closely related set of questions-will consti-</page><page sequence="11">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 11 I intend to be as rigorous as possible in confining this essay to the single issue of corporate voluntarism.36 tute the single class of corporate conduct that will be of most acute concern to later portions of this essay. But decisions whether or not to disclose are no different from other classes of corporate conduct in that, if we want them made differently than they are made today, we must decide to what source we will look for the desired modification of corporate behavior: corporate voluntarism (ic., disclosure, by someone within the corporation, even where long- run profit-maximization calls for secrecy, see C. STONE, supra note 5, at 213-16 (proposals for protecting "whistle blowers"); Weiss, Disclosure and Corporate Accountabzlty, 34 Bus. LAW. 575, 602-03); legal sanctions (zie., disclosure required by laws backed by adequate and enforceable sanctions, see R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp;J. SELIGMAN, supra note 6, at 141, 144, 173-77; Muel- ler, Corporate Secrecy vs. Corporate Disclosure, in CORPORATE POWER IN AMERICA 111, 123-27 (R. Nader &amp; M. Green eds. 1973)); or nonlegal social or political pressure on the corporation to make disclosures. Increasing the scope or accuracy of corporate disclosure, in itself, is not any more necessarily a matter of corporate social responsibility than is a reduced level of pollution or an increased level of minority hiring by the corporation. Of course, disclosure does differ from many other kinds of desired corporate conduct, in that we rarely seek it for its own sake. More likely, we hope that increased disclosure- whether voluntary or triggered by external pressures-will itself facilitate the process of bringing new external pressures to bear on the corporation to modify its substantive conduct. See, e.g., Weiss, supra, at 602; note 36 znfra (discussion of Professor Schwartz). But see Weiss, supra, at 600. This peculiarity of the disclosure issue does not, however, reduce the value of making the distinctions I have been suggesting. 36. The various distinctions I have just drawn in text have been drawn by other com- mentators as well, and certainly there is no mystery about them. See, e.g., Coffee, Beyond the Shut-Eyed Sentgy. Toward a Theoretical Vziw of Corporate Misconduct and an Effctive Legal Response, 63 VA. L. REV. 1099, 1115, 1275 (1977). Closely related to this, a number of writers have explicitly explored the possibility of lengthening corporate planning horizons. See, e.g., Bronfenbrenner, supra note 20, at 184-85; Likert, The Injfence of Social Research on Corporate Responsiility, in A NEW RATIONALE FOR CORPORATE SOCIAL POLICY 20, 37-38 (1970); note 93 infra. More generally, none of the distinctions I have been exploring in text seems to cause great trouble in the writings of opponents of corporate social responsibility. See, e.g., H. MANNE &amp; H. WALLICH, supra note 20, at 4-6 (lecture of Professor Manne); sources cited note 87 zinfra. And even among the current proponents, Professor Stone, for example, is very con- scious of at least the basic distinction between voluntarism and conduct legislatively com- pelled (or encouraged). See C. STONE, supra note 5, at 27-29, 35-57, 71-73, 134. Nevertheless, some of the most publicized of the current proponents blur or ignore the various distinctions I have been discussing in ways that tend to cause great confusion. This is particularly striking in the work of the Nader group and, at important junctures, in Professor Stone's book-both of which are discussed at some length at text accompanying notes 343-423 znfra. But other prominent proponents, such as Professor Donald E. Schwartz, seem to suffer from similar confusions-sometimes despite apparently acute awareness of the dan- ger of confusion. In Professor Schwartz's case, these confusions so blur what he has to say that I find it hard even to articulate what I think happens to his analysis. This therefore seems the appropriate moment to give at least one important illustration of the problems with his ap- proach-without pretending to any kind of organized critique of his work. In Towards New Corporate Coals: Co-Existence With Socicty, supra note 25, Schwartz describes the "strategy" of Campaign GM as having "asked that shareholders take the lead in prevent- ing or correcting harmful social implications of corporate conduct." Id at 83. Schwartz, who was a director of Campaign GM's sponsoring organization, the Project on Corporate Respon- sibility, urges that "the corporate democratic forms be invigorated" in public corporations</page><page sequence="12">12 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 B. The Central Question The fundamental question of corporate social responsibility is when, if ever, it is socially desirable that a corporation organized for profit forego profit because some decisionmaking body or process within the corporation purports to identify a social need that pursuit of the profit motive will not fill. The centrality of this question be- comes apparent if one thinks briefly about a number of related and much discussed questions, and observes that these either: (1) are questions of the organizational or other means to be used within the area of corporate social responsibility, and are not usefully consid- ered until after deciding whether we want corporations ever volunta- rily to forego profits, and if so in what circumstances; or (2) are just not very important. 1. Issues of means. Compulsory corporate structural reform-which is sometimes more generally, to serve ends similar to those sought by Campaign GM. Id at 104. But the interesting question is just why and in what form revitalized shareholder democracy should or would be likely to broaden the categories of social cost and benefit given weight in corporate decisionmaking. In answering that question, Professor Schwartz seems unable to decide which way to turn. On the one hand, he urges us to "begin by accepting the notion that there is a legitimate and necessary shareholder concern and responsibility with the social impact of corporate con- duct." Id at 93. At this juncture Professor Schwartz seems to have in mind a moral obliga- tion on the part of shareholders, and seems to consider shareholder democracy a route to corporate altruism-an altruism we can legitimately seek from shareholders because of the moral significance of their financial position. See id at 93 (citing J. SIMON, C. POWERS &amp; J. GUNNEMANN, supra note 20, at 18-25). In other portions of the same article, however, Professor Schwartz seems to have in mind a very different link between increased shareholder participation and socially enlightened corporate decisionmaking. He argues that an enlivened shareholder electoral process may "provid[e] the occasion and the machinery for cranking up larger political processes." Id at 83; see id at 93, 97. On this view, shareholder democracy, and accompanying disclosure, are most important as they influence the "political climate" outside the corporation, id. at 91, in the society at large. This climate in turn determines what management actions are in the corporation's own profit-maximizing interests. Shareholder democracy becomes no longer a route to corporate altruism; it is rather a route to modifying-by external political means- the likely longrun profit consequences to the corporation of a given corporate policy. Strictly speaking, it is not impossible to view revitalized shareholder democracy as a route both to increased corporate voluntarism and to increased political and social pressures for corporate "responsibility." Professor Schwartz may be saying simply that the morality of shareholder altruism legitimates the use of corporate democracy in the ways he urges; but that as a practical matter the triggering of external pressures is the only means by which shareholder democracy can modify corporate conduct. However, Professor Schwartz's reluc- tance to commit himself fully to one or the other view-or to some defined mixture of the two-constantly interferes with his analysis. For another expression of Professor Schwartz's views, see Schwartz, A Case for Federal Chartering of Corporatzons, 31 Bus. LAW. 1125 (1976).</page><page sequence="13">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 13 suggested as a method of increasing corporate sensitivity to the long- run profit consequences of law and social pressure37-is also often proposed with the additional purpose of stimulating corporate vol- untarism.38 This purpose may be closely related to the goal of in- creasing corporate awareness of outside pressures-as when the voluntarism sought is solely that of compliance with substantive legal norms that are wholly or partly unenforceable by external means even in the long term.39 In fact, the occasional fuzziness of the line40 between increasing corporate sensitivity to legal penalties and en- couraging corporations to obey laws regardless of the penalty level, may partly account for the tendency in the literature to apply the corporate social responsibility label even to issues of the former kind.41 But mandatory structural reform may also be intended to stimulate corporate voluntarism across a broader front than obedi- ence to unenforceable legal norms. Much of the writing of the pro- ponents of "more" corporate social responsibility is apparently devoted to advocating structural reforms of just such broad intent.42 However broad or narrow the voluntarism sought by compelling structural changes, I find it difficult to understand how one can start advocating a particular means of expanding corporate voluntarism, before one has an intelligible theory of when it is destrable that corpo- rations forego profits.43 This particular form of placing the cart 37. See text accompanying note 33 supra. 38. This certainly seems to be true of the Nader reform proposals, for example, and at least to some degree of Professor Stone's as well. See text accompanying notes 343-423 zn/a. I cannot agree with Professor Manne that any substantive conduct triggered initially by compulsory structural reform is by its nature outside the area of corporate social responsibil- ity. See H. MANNE &amp; H. WALLICH, supra note 20, at 6 (lecture of Professor Manne). 39. See Chirelstein, supra note 10, at 52-53. 40. See note 30 supra. 41. See text accompanying notes 33-35 supra. 42. See note 38 supra. 43. The debate about means is extensive and often heated. Moreover, it does not make a division merely between proponents and opponents of "more" corporate social responsibil- ity-two contending forces who are in any event divided by their ideas about the ends of the public corporation, and who are probably not divided further by questions of means but rather retreat sometimes into the rhetoric of means so as to curtail more intractable debates. The means debate also turns the proponents against one another. See, e.g., R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp; J. SELIGMAN, supra note 6, at 124 (criticizing Stone's proposals for general and special public directors, see text accompanying notes 403-09 zbfra); C.

The most prominent issue in the means debate is that of the relative and absolute mer-</page><page sequence="14">14 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 before the horse seems the most pervasive and most critical failing of the corporate social responsibility proponents.44 2. Legal permzsslbilzty. an unnmportant 'ssue or an zssue of means. Even under current legal standards, as a practical matter and within the range of cases of primary concern to this essay, there are probably no substantial statutory or judicial barriers to corporate voluntarism. In 48 states and the District of Columbia, one or an- other form of generous statutory language purports to authorize traditional sorts of corporate charitable contributions.45 Even if its-even on the assumption that some corporate voluntarism may be desirable-of the vari- ous proposals that have been put forward for adding "public interest directors" to the boards of large corporations. See, e.g., Conard, supra note 10. But the debate hardly ends there. Other familiar strands include: (1) the role that mandatory disclosure can or cannot be ex- pected to play in encouraging corporate altruism, see, e.g., note 36 supra (writings of Professor Schwartz); (2) the extent to which "voluntary" disclosure by "whistle-blowing" employees within the corporation should or should not be encouraged by giving them legal protection against reprisals, see note 307 zn/fa; compare R. NADER, P. PETKAS &amp; K. BLACKWELL, WHIS- TLE BLOWING (1972), and C. STONE, supra note 5, at 215-16, with C. STONE, supra note 5, at 214 (quoting former General Motors chairman James M. Roche on whistle-blowing as "an- other tactic for spreading disunity and creating conflict"); (3) the degree and way in which one's selection of means to encourage corporate voluntarism must take account of the current (although somewhat diminishing) subservience of corporate boards to senior executives, see R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp; J. SELIGMAN, supra note 6, at 94-102; see generall M. MACE, DIREC- TORS: MYTH AND REALITY (1971); see a/so Investor Responsibility Research Center, Inc., 1978 Analysis G, Corporate Accountability and Corporate Governance 8-11 (Feb. 10, 1978); and even, at least on the periphery of the debate, (4) the ways in which one's selection of means to encourage voluntarism (or other desired corporate conduct) should take account of the personality types of corporate executives, see generally M. MACCOBY, THE GAMESMAN (1976). The only direct concern of this essay with questions of means will arise where changes of means might arguably enhance the social desirability of corporate voluntarism, as by provid- ing political legitimacy to altruistic management decisions. See text accompanying notes 93-100 zn/fa. 44. See texts accompanying notes 93-100, 379-423 znJfa. The single outstanding excep- tion to this general shortcoming on the part of the proponents, of which I am aware, is the serious undertaking by Messrs. Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann to develop, from general theoretical principles, a set of "Suggested Guidelines for the Consideration of Factors Other than Maximum Return in the Management of [a] University's Investments." J. SIMON, C. POWERS &amp; J. GUNNEMANN, supra note 20, at 171. But their ultimate focus is shareholder re- sponsibilities in particular-and, more particularly still, the responsibilities of university en- dowment funds as investors. Although I will later draw heavily on the approach taken by this group, the authors themselves acknowledge at the outset this restriction on their work. Id at 5-6. 45. Actually, the category of traditional charitable contributions will not be a primary focus of this essay. But the question whether such contributions, as a practice, are socially desirable does constitute part of our topic. See text accompanying notes 225-37 infra. A highly usable survey of the state statutes on traditional contributions, although in numerous details an outdated one, appears in Blumberg, Corporate Responsibilty and the Social Crisi, 50 B.U. L. REV. 157 (1970). By far the most common categories of authorized contri-</page><page sequence="15">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 15 there were no such statutes, straight gifts to charity, within broad limits, would most likely be upheld today.46 The situation is somewhat more complicated with respect to the voluntary sacrifice of profits in the course of operations-a more central focus of this essay-but the end result is much the same. Cer- tainly corporate management cannot rely with assurance or con- sistency on authorization of this kind of altruism by the specific language of the charitable donation statutes.47 Nor should this lack of assurance be viewed merely as an accident of language: Sacrifices in the course of operations are "open-ended," and are potential bur- dens on administrative resources, in ways that straight donations are not.48 Nevertheless, the pure legal question of a corporation altruisti- cally foregoing potential operating profits probably does not matter bution, today as when Blumberg wrote, are those contained in ? 4(m) of the Model Business Corporation Act: "Each corporation shall have power: . . . . (m) To make donation for the public welfare or for charitable, scientific or educational purposes." ABA-ALI MODEL Bus. CORP. ACT ? 4(m) (1979). Often the state statutes add categories to those of the Model Act. California, for example, adds references to "community fund," "hospital," "civic," and "simi- lar purposes." CAL. CORP. CODE ? 207(e) (West 1977). Among the additional categories most commonly joined with those of the Model Act are "religious," e.g., ILL. ANN. STAT. ch. 32, ? 157.5(m) (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1979); MASS. ANN. LAWS ch. 156B, ? 9(k) (Michie/Law. Co-op 1979), and "aid of war," e.g., DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, ? 122(9) (1974); ILL. ANN. STAT. ch. 32, ? 157.5(m) (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1979); MASS. ANN. LAWS ch. 156B, ? 9(k) (Michie/Law. Co-op 1979). See a/so ABA-ALI MODEL Bus. CORP. ACT ? 4(n) (1979) ("Each corporation shall have power: . . . . (n) To transact any lawful business which the board of directors shall find will be in aid of governmental policy"). Section 4(n) has been enacted in several states. See, e.g., DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, ? 122(12) (1974) (similar to ? 4(n)); FLA. STAT. ANN. ? 607.01 1(1 (West 1977); OR. REV. STAT. ? 57.030(14) (1977); TEX. Bus. CORP. ACT ANN. art. 2.02(A)(15) (Vernon Supp. 1978-1979). 46. See, e.g., A.P. Smith Mfg. Co. v. Barlow, 13 N.J. 145, 98 A.2d 581, appeal dismzssed, 346 U.S. 861 (1953); Union Pac. R.R. v. Trustees, Inc., 8 Utah 2d 101, 329 P.2d 398 (1958). Moreover, as long as a corporation's charitable contributions fall within the definition contained in I.R.C. ? 170(c), they are deductible for federal income tax purposes up to a limit of 5% of taxable income. See I.R.C. ? 170(b)(2). Of course, it should not just be assumed that the state statutes authorize gifts in "unreasonable" amounts or to "pet" charities, see Theo- dora Holding Corp. v. Henderson, 257 A.2d 398 (Del. Ch. 1969); but with respect to public corporations (which will be our primary concern, see text accompanying note 69 zJi#a), while there is always the possibility of a conflict of interest, the gifts that are actually made do not press close to the explicit quantity limit of the Internal Revenue Code or the (largely) implicit quantity limits of the state statutes. See Baumol, Enlightened Se/f-Interest and Corporate Phi/an- thropy, in A NEW RATIONALE FOR CORPORATE SOCIAL POLICY 3, 10 &amp; n.6 (1970). In short, traditional charitable gifts by public corporations, as long as in good faith, are in effect un- restricted by law. 47. See Blumberg, supra note 45, at 174, 195. 48. See Mundheim, supra note 32, at 1254. Professor Mundheim then continues, in fur- ther highly relevant remarks: "[T]he company may become subject to the almost irresistible pressure of trying to save a floundering project by investing additional funds. . . .

Section 501(c) specifies those organiza-</page><page sequence="16">16 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 very much.49 This is because management will generally have a suc- cessful defense of the action in question, vis-a-vis shareholders,50 on other grounds: management's (putative) belief, as a matter of busi- ness judgment, that the shortrun sacrifice of some profits would oper- ate to the shareholders' longrun benefit. Judicial review of either the bona fides or the reasonableness of such a management judgment is quite narrow. As a practical matter, the business judgment defense is unlikely to fail in the absence of conflicts of interest, extraordinary amounts of profit foregone, or some other affirmative suggestion of bad faith.5" And all this is no less true because the defense is disin- tions which society has designated through the political process as serving the public welfare sufficiently to warrant special treatment." Id 49. The pure legal question also does not arise very often-for much the same reasons that are about to be discussed in the text-and so there is not a great deal of authority on it. Probably the best that can be said about it substantively is to make just three observations. First, even in theory, the question would not today be best viewed in general as involving technical ultra vires doctrine (whatever language courts may use), but rather as essentially a question of management fiduciary duties. Cf. note 52 infra (duty to creditors). Seegeneral'y H. HENN, HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF CORPORATIONS ?? 183-184 (2d ed. 1970); Note, Corporate A/truism. A Rational Approach, 59 GEO. L.J. 117, 124-35 (1970). Second, and quite narrowly, if the altruism in question were to consist exclusively of voluntary adherence to legal rules unenforceable by external means even in the long term, see texts accompanying notes 33-35, 39 supra; text accompanying notes 113-209 infra, there is little question that management would be within its discretion to sacrifice operating profits. See J. SIMON, C. POWERS &amp; J. GUNNEMANN, supra note 20, at 32, 144-45, 152-56. But finally, the leading decided case on the more general issue, although hardly disposi- tive even of that general issue much less of particular applications, purports to announce that the board of directors in general lacks power to pursue "primary" purposes other than share- holder profits. See Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., 204 Mich. 459, 170 N.W. 668 (1919). The Dodge court stated: "A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end. The discretion of directors is to be exercised in the choice of means to attain that end, and does not extend to a change in the end itself, to the reduction of profits, or to the non-distribution of profits among stockholders in order to devote them to other purposes." Id at 507, 170 N.W. at 684. As contrary authority to Dodge, Professor Blumberg suggests State ex rel. Sorensen v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R.R., 112 Neb. 248, 199 N.W. 534 (1924). Blumberg, supra note 45, at 170-72, 202-04. Though Professor Blumberg finds that Sorensen approved "corporate charity for charity's sake without reference to benefit or self-interest," id. at 171, it takes considerable effort to read Sorensen that way. The Sorensen court did not deal with any argument that an alleged reduction in net earnings would violate shareholder rights. If a corporate manage- ment ever explicitly had to defend altruistic sacrifice of operating profits, its best authority would probably rather be occasional language in traditional donation cases. See, e.g., A.P. Smith Mfg. Co. v. Barlow, 13 N.J. 145, 154, 98 A.2d 581, 586, appeal dismissed, 346 U.S. 861 (1953) ("[M]odern conditions require that corporations acknowledge and discharge social as well as private responsibilities as members of the communities within which they operate."). The question whether such language should be read as having import beyond the donation cases can at least be argued both ways. 50. Cf. note 52 znfra (duty to creditors). 51. The leading case is Shlensky v. Wrigley, 95 Ill. App. 2d 173, 237 N.E.2d 776 (1968). The lesson of ShAensk,y is that unless management insists on making altruistic motives painfully</page><page sequence="17">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 17 genuous in any instance of corporate social responsibility as we have defined that term.52 Even given all these reasons that corporate altruism, particularly by public corporations, is for our purposes essentially free of legal restrictions in practice, the question of the theoretical legal standard to be applied to management decisions might still be of interest in another way: A case might conceivably be made for explicit legisla- tive promulgation of a public interest standard for directorial ac- tions.53 This standard might operate either as a replacement for the legal duty to maximize longrun profit, or merely as an alternate de- fense of management decisions that were not well calculated to maxi- explicit-as Henry Ford apparently did, see Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., 204 Mich. 459, 170 N.W. 668 (1919); note 49 supra-any arguable longrun benefit to the corporation will do. See Mundheim, supra note 32, at 1253 n.60; cf Union Pac. R.R. v. Trustees, Inc., 8 Utah 2d 101, 329 P.2d 398 (1958) (on facts a traditional charitable contribution case). See a/so Sylvia Mar- tin Foundation, Inc. v. Swearingen, 260 F. Supp. 231 (S.D.N.Y. 1966) (dictum); Kelly v. Bell, 254 A.2d 62 (Del. Ch. 1969), aj'd, 266 A.2d 878 (Del. 1970). 52. See text accompanying note 30 supra. An instance of corporate altruism is also un- likely to be held to violate the corporation's general duties to its credttors-and is therefore unlikely to trigger any remedies on the part of those creditors that they would not otherwise have. See generally Clark, The Duties of the Corporate Debtor to Its Creditors, 90 HARV. L. REv. 505 (1977). Individual creditors might negotiate for contractual prohibitions of management altru- ism. More to the point-because of management's generally broad discretion to deem any given action not purely altruistic, but rather an instance of enlightened self-interest--debt instruments might bar specific, anticipated actions that the creditors considered bad business. For example, a loan agreement might require that the debtor's plant use the lowest-cost avail- able fuel, even if management purported to reach a judgment that the pollution produced in burning this fuel had grave costs to the corporation's good will. However, even if such cove- nants were consistently enforceable, presumably management could avoid making them in any given instance by paying a higher interest rate. Thus, in the sphere of creditors' rights, the likely legal obstacles to altruism will often reduce to an outlay of additional shareholder assets (te., interest payments). This may make the cost of a given altruistic acitivity higher than it looks, and even more difficult than it would otherwise be to keep account of accu- rately. But the possibility that altruism will raise the corporation's cost of debt capital does not qualitatively change either the legal or the policy analysis of corporate voluntarism. Indeed, a similar analysis would apply to equity capital as well. Investors in new equity, or indeed some or all of the original investors in a corporation, could demand an agreement, or even a charter provision, that, say, the corporation's plant would use the lowest-cost avail- able fuel. Here again, either management or those stockholders who favor the use of a cleaner fuel could avoid any such limitation at the price of a somewhat higher cost of capital. A nice question arises here, particularly with respect to publicly held corporations: On an assumption of full disclosure of instances of corporate altruism, will the securities markets operate to raise the corporation's cost of capital when management engages in altruistic activ- ities? We will return to this question in the final portion of this essay, in connection with the discussion of disclosure. See note 330 rnifa. 53.

Its purpose would be to try to force (if it replaced current fiduciary standards) or encourage (if it operated solely as an alternate defense) some managerial sacrifice of shareholder interests-within whatever spheres of corporate activity the new standard was promulgated to cover. Those who have thought seriously about the problem of adopting such a standard for all managerial decisions have been justifiably pessimistic about its usefulness.55 On the other hand, I would not be ready to say offhand that its promulgation with reference to partzcular corporate activities, and solely as an alternate management defense, might not occasion- ally be useful.56 Rather, the point for our purposes is that such modi- fication of management's theoretical duties, to encourage some sacrifice of shareholder interests, can only be viewed as yet another means of getting corporations altruistically to pursue nonshareholder concerns.57 And once again, I do not see how one can turn to such questions of means before one has an intelligible theory on the more fundamental issue: When is it desirable that corporations voluntarily should seek social goals beyond those effected by profit-maximiza- tion? My ambitions in this essay do not extend beyond the casting of some dim light on this one, most central question of corporate social responsibility. III. IS THE CENTRAL QUESTION WORTH DEBATING? As a final introductory matter, let me defend the proposition that 54. See Vagts, supra note 53, at 46. See a/so Conard, supra note 10, at 949. 55.

No attention seems to have been given in the literature to the possibility of such narrow scope for a public interest fiduciary standard. Yet consider the case of a public policy area in which the legislature: (1) is uneasy about the types of conduct being encouraged by corporate pursuit of profits; (2) feels the need of more information before acting to modify corporate incentives through new liability rules or regulatory measures; and (3) believes that corporate managements themselves have considerable case-by-case information about the so- cial costs of the profit-oriented conduct in question. Without presentation at this stage of the general view of corporate social responsibility from which this example arises, one might make a case in such a situation for a temporary legislative measure to encourage some corpo- rate voluntarism, pending legislative resolution of the general policy issue. Such a temporary measure would be a signal to corporate managements that the legislature saw the need for some voluntarism in the particular policy area. And a possible example of such a temporary measure might be explicitly to "loosen" the theoretical fiduciary obligation of profit-max- imization as it bore on the policy area in question. 57.

Certainly there is infact a substan- tial literature, and a substantial public debate, about whether society should compel corporate structural reforms to engender more volun- tarism-particularly in the case of the public company.58 But the 58. The literature in favor of and opposed to such reforms is cited throughout this essay. See, e.g., note 36 supra; note 87 and text accompanying notes 343-423 rnfra. Moreover, if one believes what corporate leaders say about such matters, they themselves present by no means a monolithic opposition to at least the result of corporate altruism. See, e.g., Brenner &amp; Mo- lander, Is the Ethics of Business Changing?, HARV. Bus. REV., Jan.-Feb. 1977, at 57, 68-70 (methodologically a very unpersuasive survey); Holmes, Executive Perceptions of Corporate Social Responszbzzty, Bus. HORIZONS, June 1976, at 34 (somewhat better methodologically, although still not good). See also L. SILK &amp; D. VOGEL, ETHICS &amp; PROFITS: THE CRISIS OF CONFI- DENCE IN AMERICAN BUSINESS 236 (1976); sources cited note 93 rnfra (on "managerialism"). However, most corporate institutional reforms endorsed by organizations of businessmen or their lawyers have been primarily directed not at spurring altruism, but at most at protecting shareholders. See Business Roundtable, supra note 21. See genera4'y Subcommittee on Func- tions and Responsibilities of Directors, Committee on Corporate Laws, Section of Corpora- tion, Banking &amp; Business Law, American Bar Association, Corporate Director's Guidebook, 32 Bus. LAW. 5 (1976). In many ways the most interesting question is whether any public officials favor using the force of government to restructure corporate governance toward the end of increasing corporate altruism. While there is certainly not an overwhelming movement in this direction, the evidence is somewhat mixed. There does not seem to be any trend at the state level toward mandatory restructuring to encourage corporate altruism. Cf The Role of the Share- holder zn the Corporate World Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Cztizens and Shareholders Rzghts and Remedzes of the Senate Comm. on theJudziiay, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977) (corporate governance hearings of Senator Metzenbaum's (then) Subcommittee on Citizens and Shareholders Rights and Remedies likewise directed, at least immediately, toward shareholder protection rather than increased corporate altruism). See a/so SEC. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) A-I to -2 (May 16, 1979). However, some of the federal agencies have occasionally shown interest in the possibil- ity of structural reforms with this sort of purpose. For one thing, this is true of two agencies without the most direct concern in the corpo- rate governance area; but nothing much seems to have come of these expressions of interest so far. See TRADE REG. REP. (CCH) 10 (Oct. 24, 1977) (FTC announces establishment of task force on corporate accountability, under direction of Office of Policy Planning, to explore a variety of governance proposals); J. Kreps, Speech to the Chief Executive Officers Confer- ence, Duke University, Oct. 19, 1977 (announcing multipart Commerce Department pro- gram on corporate social responsibility, including establishment of a special task force and of a project to develop and publish a "Social Performance Index" applicable to the efforts of each corporation). Beyond this, the speeches of some SEC Commissioners, and especially of Chairman Williams, frequently contain implications, and occasionally are explicit, that mandatory restructuring to trigger more voluntarism might prove desirable. In particular, in two speeches during the past year, SEC. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) A-20 to -21 (Apr. 25, 1979) (speech before New York Legal Aid Society); SEC. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) A-II to -13 (Oct. 11, 1978) (speech at Columbia University/McGraw-Hill Lectures in Business and Society), Chairman Williams seems to be suggesting that, unless corporations voluntarily respect "in- ner normative restrictions . . . based on ethics and morality," id. at A- 13, government may be expected to compel changes in corporate behavior; and that such compulsion may be ex- pected to include the indirect measure of forcibly modifying internal corporate governance processes so as to engender "moral" or "ethical" external conduct. These two speeches should</page><page sequence="20">20 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 current debate would nevertheless not be worth entering on its own be read in conjunction with other things Chairman Williams has said. See, e.g., Williams, Corporate Accountability and the Law.yer's Role, 34 Bus. LAW. 7, 9-10 (1978); SEc. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) AA-1 to -5 (Mar. 7, 1979) (interview with BNA); SEc. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) A-14 to - 16 (Jan. 24, 1979) (speech before Sixth Annual Securities Regulation Institute); SEC. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) A-22 Jan. 25, 1978) (speech before Fifth Annual Securities Regulation Insti- tute). Chairman Williams's views are certainly not unanimously held by the Commissioners. See, e.g., SEC. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) A-3 June 13, 1979) (speech of Commissioner Karmel before American Stock Exchange Wharton School Conference on Mid-Ridge Companies). Moreover, most of the Commission's concrete "corporate governance" initiatives, and cer- tainly those of the Exchanges, have not gone nearly so far as might be suggested by the tone of some of Chairman Williams's remarks. Indeed, it is not altogether clear they could do so as a matter of statutory power. Most significantly, however far-ranging public testimony at the Commission's 1977 corporate governance hearings, the proxy rule amendments and proposals that have emerged thus far from those hearings are not directed to spurring corporate altru- ism. See Securities Act Release No. 34-16104 (Aug. 13, 1979), reprinted in [1979 Transfer Binder] FED. SEC. L. REP. (CCH) 1 82,176; Securities Act Release No. 34-15384 (Dec. 6, 1978), reprinted in SEC. REG. &amp; L. REP. (BNA) E-1 (Dec. 13, 1978) (with arguable exception of modification of shareholder-proposal procedures under Rule 14a-8). Similarly, most Com- mission enforcement actions seem exclusively actions of shareholder protection-even where the remedies sought and obtained include the addition of independent directors and the es- tablishment of an independent audit committee. Indeed, in a couple of substantive areas, the Commission has adamantly resisted specific petitions to extend disclosure requirements be- yond the dictates of material shareholder economic interests and has recently been upheld in that resistance by the District of Columbia Circuit. See NRDC v. SEC, 19 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. 724 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 20, 1979) (environmental and job-bias disclosure). Nevertheless, there are two prominent substantive areas in which surprising reluctance on the Commission's part to limit disclosure requirements to the usual instances of direct material shareholder economic interest might suggest a desire to make corporations respon- sive to something more than the profit motive. These are the areas of management perqui- sites and of foreign and domestic payments. Even in these two areas, however, the SEC has not been willing explicitly to premise regulatory actions or proposals on the proposition that corporate altruism ought to be encouraged. As to management perquisites, the Commission's disclosure requirements have not con- sistently respected an economic materiality limitation. Seegenerally Securities Act Release No. 33-6003 (Dec. 4, 1978), reprinted in 5 FED. SEC. L. REP. (CCH) 1 70,962; Securities Act Release Nos. 33-5904, 34-14445 (Feb. 6, 1978), reprinted in 2 FED. SEC. L. REP. (CCH) ? 23,019A. One might argue that such broad disclosure requirements must reflect a desire to protect the social interest in corporate morality even where significant shareholder financial interests are unaf- fected. But it seems more plausible that the Commission's concern with minor perquisites grows out of its perception of a shareholder concern with management's systematic ability to keep track of and limit such unauthorized expenditures in general. See generall n re Hycel, Inc., Securities Act Release No. 14981 (uly 20, 1978), reprinted in [1978 Transfer Binder] FED. SEC. L. REP. (CCH) 1 81,676. The area of illegal foreign and domestic payments is more complicated. Even before the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-213, 91 Stat. 1494, the Commission had some success in court arguing that questionable payments to promote business might be material matters for disclosure though the payments were not large. The Commission suc- cessfully argued that such payments were material either because the integrity of manage- ment is inherently a material question, or because of contingent liabilities (or threats to future revenue) suggested by the fact of the payments.

A. Corporate and Individual Altruism Whether a corporation organized for profit should voluntarily forego profit in the pursuit of some social goal it has identified sounds like a question more about social conduct in general than about cor- porate conduct in particular. That is, is it sensible, or even possible, to ask about the social desirability of corporate altruism without also asking about the desirability of individual altruism? I do think that the desirability of corporate voluntarism is to a significant degree a distinct topic.59 The fundamental reason for this-in very oversimplified form60-may be thought of as the neces- sity that corporate altruism rest on a narrower social justification (CCH) 1 96,485 (E.D. Wis. 1978). See also Berkman v. Rust Craft Greeting Cards, Inc., 454 F. Supp. 787 (S.D.N.Y. 1978); Cooke v. Teleprompter Corp., 334 F. Supp. 467 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). It seems, at best, no easier to take such "materiality" rationales at face value in this area than to suggest they may mask a regulatory desire to push corporations toward more "responsible" substantive conduct, see Weiss, supra note 35, at 598, by raising the possibility of either: (1) adverse shareholder reaction to questionable payments (in which case the disclosure require- ment would be intended to trigger more corporate social responsibility in our sense); or (2) adverse outside reaction (in which case the disclosure requirement would be essentially an enforcement technique for laws or social norms unrelated to the SEC's usual functions, see note 36 supra). See Coffee, supra note 36, at 1247 &amp; n.527, 1252, 1253-55 (citing much evi- dence in SEC words and actions that "materiality" rationales here are disingenuous). Since neither of these two "extra-materiality" rationales for Commission interest in the payments area was easy to square with the SEC's statutory authority, see id. at 1250-52 &amp; n.546, 1253-55; note 147 infra, it is not surprising that the "materiality" rationales were the ones explicitly advanced in court. But the early history of Commission involvement on the pay- ments question could easily be viewed, in part, as an attempt to use mandatory disclosure to shareholders so as to modify-in the direction of more voluntarism-internal corporate think- ing about substantive behavior. As it happens, the books-and-records and internal-accounting requirements added by ? 102 of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as ? 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. ? 78(m)(b)(2) (West Supp. 1972-1978)-while raising questions about Congress's intentions (and, indeed, additional questions about the Commission) not altogether different from those I have just been asking about the SEC-change the focus of and partially moot these particular questions about the agency. See notes 152, 153 &amp; 155 znfta. 59. We will not be able to proceed without asking some questions, and reaching some tentative conclusions, about the role of altruism in social organization generally. But I be- lieve we can confine our larger inquiries to certain matters bearing directly on the problem of the corporation. Thus, for example, while the tenets of the sociobiologists have numerous points of apparent tangency and some points of apparent tension with the arguments ex- amined in this essay, see Wilson, A/truism, HARV. MAGAZINE, Nov.-Dec. 1978, at 23, it will not be necessary for us to explore them. 60.

Consider, for exam- ple, the case of cash gifts to organized charities.61 Any social justifi- cations one might advance for the making of such gifts by for-profit corporations would almost surely apply as well to donations by indi- viduals. But if all such common rationales for both corporate and individual donations were to prove unpersuasive, there would remain one vitally important justification applicable only to individual giv- ing: the pleasure taken from it by the donors themselves-the aspect of charitable giving that resembles any consumption expenditure.62 The analogous rationale, with respect to corporate donations could not, as a practical matter, rest on any pleasure taken by the share- holders.63 Rather, it would have to involve the gratification felt by management. And as soon as the matter is put that way it becomes apparent, as a question of both law and policy, that this "consump- tion" justification64 just does not work with respect to corporate do- nationS.65 61. Again, this is not a central focus of this essay, but it is a part of our topic, and provides a useful illustration in the current context. See note 45 supra; text accompanying notes 225-37 zn,fa. 62. For a much fuller articulation of this justification, see notes 64, 66 znpfa. 63. See note 25 supra. If nothing else, any argument in terms of shareholder pleasure runs up against the large proportion of institutional ownership in large, publicly held corpo- rations. See, e.g., R. POZEN, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT-CASES, MATERIALS AND PROBLEMS 11-12 (1978). 64. To term the pleasure-in-giving justification one of "consumption" is not in any way to denigrate its moral content. I would guess that a great deal of charitable giving arises from the donor's perception of what is right, and for many of the donors of whom this is true, it is enough that charity is right; without any consideration of rewards or punishments after death, for example. But as a society we do not have generally shared views about how much, or which, charitable giving is "right"; at least we have no such generally shared views other than those reflected in politically enacted tax expenditure programs. Therefore, when a particular do- nor directs to the support of a particular charity so much of our social resources as that donor is able to control, it is difficult to see the economic significance of this action-from the society's viewpoint-as distinguishable from a consumption decision by the donor. See note 66 znfra. 65. Legally, this justification runs up against perhaps the most basic principle of corpo- ration law-management's "duty of loyalty" never to favor personal interests over corporate interests. See H. HENN, supra note 49, ? 235. As a question of policy, it would hardly seem conducive to capital formation under centralized management for the law to allow such man- agement to do as it will with corporate profits. While one answer to this is that a manage- ment will not long hold office if it does things with the profits that are unsatisfactory to shareholders, the practical limitations of the proxy system substantially undercut this re- sponse as applied to public corporations. See notes 22-24, 26 and text accompanying notes 21-24 supra. (Nor, although this carries us far beyond the scope of this essay, is the availabil- ity of the outside takeover a complete alternate response. See text accompanying notes 72-74 infta.) Of course, pleasure-in-giving may be viewed as one aspect of executive compensation; it may help with the recruiting and retention of executive talent, and permitting management</page><page sequence="23">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 23 The conclusion that there is good conceptual reason to treat al- truism by corporations as a distinct topic66 is reinforced by some to experience it may therefore further the corporation's longrun self-interest. But corporate charitable gifts justified in this particular way are not altruistic at all. Indeed, except as a means of avoiding fully candid disclosure, it is difficult to imagine that executives would prefer discretionary control of a dollar to be given to charity over a straight salary increase of the same dollar-which could either be given to charity or spent in any other way. See notes 222, 223 bnfa. (Neither dollar is taxed to the corporation, and the salary dollar is taxed to the executive only if not given to charity.) 66. It might well be argued that the "consumption" justification is less of a distinction between corporate and other charity than at first appears. It might be suggested that all private charity must justify itself by its contribution to a pluralistic or democratic process of making ultimate distributional decisions. Under this argument, charitable giving by for- profit corporations might be justified not because corporate giving is distributionally "right" in any one instance, see text accompanying notes 225-37 ih,fra, but just because, like all char- ity, it spreads the franchise on such questions. See J. SIMON, C. POWERS &amp; J. GUNNEMANN, supra note 20, at 43-45. Put the other way around, the suggestion is that if the social contri- bution of a particular charitable gift is questionable, then it is questionable no matter who makes the gift; it does not save the gift's social virtue to term it a "consumption" decision by a donor or settlor. See note 64 supra. I find this argument less than persuasive. For one thing, it seems peculiar to perceive an increase in pluralism from anything that augments the power of for-profit corporations in our social decisional processes. See Kaysen, The Corporation? How Much Power? What Scope?, in THE CORPORATION IN MODERN SOCIETY 85, 99-103 (E. Mason ed. 1972); Manning, Book Review, 67 YALE L.J. 1477, 1494-95 (1958); note 288 znfa. But beyond this-and granting the desirability of pluralistic means of reaching distributional decisions-the argument re- quires us to assume that such pluralism is better served simply because we have more power centers thinking about altruism. I suggest that additional decisional centers would help only if they were so positioned as to enable their personnel to think with especial accurag about such matters; or if they introduced into the process considerations otherwise underrepresented; or if their personnel were either unusually well suited or trained for the apprehension of social straws in the wind. But the latter two arguments obviously do not apply persuasively to for- profit corporations. See, e.g., Kaysen, supra. And while the first argument may apply to a particular for-profit corporation, as it may to a particular individual, it does not undercut the distinction between corporations and individuals that rests on the "consumption" justifica- tion-nor does it in any other way suggest that all corporations should be allowed or en- couraged to engage in charity in our pluralistic system. The question of when a corporation can think with special accuracy about opportunities for voluntarism will in fact be much of the subject of this essay. At the same time that the general argument from pluralistic decisionmaking thus fails to justify corporate altruism in general, its difficulties do not undercut the "consumption" justifi- cation for individual altruism; indeed, the desirability of pluralism only reinforces the "con- sumption" case at the individual level. If we are to have decentralized bases of ultimate distributional decisions at all, then we must have charity either by individuals or by the vehicles (trusts, foundations) that they set up to exercise their individual wills. While, neces- sarily, most such charity in dollar terms will come from the very rich, who also have a number of other sources and implements of power, there are no categorical reasons to believe that the very rich will not have a variety of tastes in charity, nor that they consistently will fail to select as executives of their charitable foundations persons with interest and training in identi- fying "insufficiently" supported charitable objects in the society. Above all, we want to live in the kind of society where individuals-as individuals, or through whatever personally estab- lished legal vehicle they may choose-decide how much of their income they will consume</page><page sequence="24">24 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 closely related practical considerations. The debate about compul- sory structural reform to stimulate corporate voluntarism67 does not come from nowhere. There is a widespread perception that corpora- tions, as currently structured, are less likely to behave altruistically than are individuals. Since corporations in general, and publicly held corporations in particular, dominate the economic life of the country, this implies that most economic activity in the United States is conducted without the leavening of even an occasional generous act. Moreover, if all this is true and if it is undesirable, publicly held corporations have the additional, special feature that society may be in a position to change these behavioral inclinations on their part. By both philosophical and legal tradition, the separation of ownership from control gives society an entering wedge-if we choose to use it- to compel structural reforms of the ways public corporations govern themselves, in the hope of increasing their inclinations to altruism.68 and in what way, and how much they will donate to others and in what way. We want this as a matter of process even in general; with regard to altruistic spending, we also want it because of what we believe it does to the character and sensibility of the giver. The "consumption" argument is in fact a shorthand for this last set of considerations. As we will discover shortly, this set of considerations does not have much force at the corporate level-and indeed, even the corporate social responsibility proponents do not try to rest on it. See text accompanying notes 81-85 inhfa. This makes corporate giving and individual giving very different from one another, and makes it desirable that we find our pluralistic founda- tion for wealth distribution in the decisions of individuals rather than in those of corpora- tions. (The question of tax exemptions and deductions in connection with individual gifts and individually established charitable organizations is beyond the scope of this essay.) 67. See note 58 supra. 68. On the philosophical tradition, see note 26 supra. The legal tradition of compulsory structural reforms in the governance of public corporations is at least 45 years old, see note 23 supra and accompanying text, but it has never been as strongly in evidence as in the recent corporate governance initiatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission. See note 58 supra. Certainly society as a whole, and government in particular, can and do influence the amount of "altruism" practiced by individuals. But devices such as the charitable deduction from federal income taxes or social pressures in the workplace to contribute to the United Fund (or similar umbrella charities) are directed at how much we give, not at the internal process by which we decide how much to give. In the language of econonlists, such devices seem primarily meant to move us along our demand curve for the pleasures of giving rather than to shi/2 this curve. While some of the advertising intended to spur individual charitable gifts may indeed be directed to shifting our demand for donative pleasures, we would find it philosophically troubling if much of such "taste-shifting" advertising-or similar activities-were engaged in by the government. (Possibly the government may use the content of public education to work such shifts in individual demand curves. But to many this zs philosophically troubling; and to many more it would be troubling if they believed that public education could domi- nate home influence in this respect.) Being urged by the government (with no, or limited, sanctions) to conserve gas, or to ask for a smaller raise next year, is not troubling to all of us (though it is to many) as long as we perceive that the government's purpose is to identify the</page><page sequence="25">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 25 B. Economzc Feasz:zlzly It is (somewhat loose) first-year economics that "in competitive markets, a sustained commitment to any goal other than profitability will lead to bankruptcy unless collusion is permitted."69 But since most large public companies compete, at least in large part, in oligo- polistic markets, this principle does not in any case throw much light on the debate about altruism by public corporations.70 Rather, the essential economic limit on the kinds of voluntarism we are discuss- ing is the level of altruistic activity at which, were an outsider to try to wrest corporate control from the current managers and eliminate the altruistic practice, his expected gains from so doing would exceed his costs. 7 While this observation has been frequently made, two related ones have not. First, the degree of competitiveness in the product market is significant even where the outer limit on corporate altruism is the threat of takeover rather than of bankruptcy: The less compet- itive the product market, the more the costs of altruism will be borne by the firm's customers rather than its shareholders,72 and so the higher the level of altruism that can be practiced before it is worth- while for an outsider to attempt to displace current management. Second, even monopolistic product markets would not seem to en- able a firm to pass on to customers any of the costs of voluntarism if those costs are unrelated to volume of production. That is, a flat, one-time altruistic expense will not shift the firm's marginal cost social importance of these particular charitable objects-that is, to let us know we should feel we are doing significant amounts of giving when we further these ends. But if we once be- lieved that the government were trying to influence how much pleasure we get out of each "un:t" of giving to whatever object-that is, that the government were trying (with some possibility of success) to alter the degree to which we are altruistic people (or worse, the degree to which our children are altruists)-I submit that most of us would see the issue in terms of dangerous thought-control, or something of the kind. It is here that our view of the public corporation is very different from our view of indi- viduals. To repeat the proposition with which I started, there is both a philosophical and a legal tradition (although by no means is there universal approval) in support of government steps to change how public corporations "think." See text accompanying notes 37-42 supra; text accompanying notes 343-423 rnfta. At least, we cannot automatically assume-as we traditionally do in the case of individuals-that such steps are harmful. 69. R. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW 310-11 (2d ed. 1977).

What is most striking out of all this is that, in the case of a large, publicly held corporation-the very kind of corporation at whom the corporate social responsibility proponents have in fact directed their proposals for structural reform-conditions allowing substantcal man- agement voluntarism in the course of operations are likely to be pres- ent even today. Many such corporations do compete in oligopolistic product markets; most forms of voluntarism in the course of opera- tions73 may be expected to raise marginal (and not just fixed) costs to at least some degree; and, above all, it is generally very expensive to displace the management of a publicly held corporation. It is not surprising, then, that a broad range of people perceive the current managements of public corporations as having substantial "discre- tionary funds" at their disposal. And if public corporations were somehow restructured, so that an increased tendency toward altru- ism would be not just an isolated leaning by one management but rather a general and unavoidable phenomenon-a phenomenon not to be dispelled in any given corporation merely by taking control of, say, the inside directorships-then this perceived room for manage- ment discretion could only be increased.74 C. Summary and Limitations In short, the social desirability of corporate altruism is a concep- tually distinct topic; it raises questions of corporate governance struc- ture on which there is a substantial current public debate; and there is no reason in economic theory to believe that corporate voluntarism is impossible, or that it must be restricted to trivial dollar values. Because this defense of the significance of our central question has been strongest as aDDlied to the larae. n,ubliclv held comnanv- and 73. Voluntarism in the course of operations, and not traditional charitable contribu- tions, will be the primary focus of this essay. See text accompanying notes 225-37 infra. 74. That is, to the degree that evey public corporation had to have, say, some public interest directors, and to the degree that these directors might have the power to implement some degree of corporate voluntarism on their own (as by disclosing unfavorable information about the corporation, see notes 35, 43 supra; note 307 zpfra), the practice of some such volun- tarism by a given corporation would not necessarily make that firm an attractive takeover candidate: New management might not be able to look forward to any increase of return on investment through reduction of (the irreducible) voluntarism. When the opponents argue that economic considerations largely preclude corporate vol- untarism, see, e.g., R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 310-12, they invariably omit reference to this point.</page><page sequence="27">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 27 because that is the type of corporation usually targeted for proposals of mandatory structural reform, I will confine my analysis of whether corporate altruism is a good thing to the case of the public firm.75 I will also impose several other limitations, rather arbitrarily, so as to keep the inquiry within manageable bounds:76 I propose to fo- cus on operating, industrial corporations rather than financial insti- tutions;77 not unrelated to this, I propose to ignore the very special problems raised by regulated industries;78 and, insofar as I will be discussing particular substantive areas of corporate conduct, I pro- pose to concentrate on the domestic rather than the foreign effects of corporate behavior.

THE STARTING PROPOSITION I start from the proposition that any social goal to be pursued by public corporations should have two closely related characteristics: first, a broad social consensus79 should support corporate pursuit of the particular goal in question; and second, some kind of reasonably clear social signal should be available to help each corporation figure out what actions are in furtherance of the goal.80 For reasons that I 75.

Mar.-Apr. 1971, at 37. See also Mundheim, supra note 32. 78. See, e.g., Blumberg, supra note 45, at 181-86. Related to this, in turn, are the special problems raised by the possibility of a consortium of corporations joining together for altruis- tic purposes. It is easy to make the case that significant categories of voluntarism will not occur in the absence of such consortia because of competitive economic pressures, see text accompanying notes 69-72 supra; or because some projects, like cleaning up a polluted river, simply cannot be pursued individually, see, e.g., H. MANNE &amp; H. WALLICH, supra note 20, at 31 (lecture of Professor Manne); or, closely related to this, because the "ethical" thing to do often cannot even be defined without explicit cooperation, see note 92 rnfra; or for other re- lated reasons. See McKie, The Issues, in SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE BUSINESS PREDIC- AMENT 1, 10-11 (J. McKie ed. 1974); note 303 infra and accompanying text. See also Baumol, supra note 46, at 11-19. On the other hand, the notion that such consortia should be permis- sible under the antitrust laws raises obvious and significant difficulties of its own. See, e.g., H. MANNE &amp; H. WALLICH, supra note 20, at 31-33 (lecture of Professor Manne); Bronfenbren- ner, supra note 20, at 187-88; TRADE REG. REP.

These issues, too, are arbitrarily excluded from the scope of this essay. 79. See note 288 rnfta. 80.

But I do not mean, by the mere statement of my initial premise, to exclude the possibility that some goals quite apart from profit-maximization may fulfill the two suggested criteria-nor even to exclude the possibility that the criteria may be fulfilled on occasion by goals that are in some sense ''noneconomic.55 Nevertheless, my starting proposition excludes two possible kinds of goals for public corporations-and one of these two has been widely advocated as appropriate and desirable. Specifically, I mean to exclude at the outset the possibilities that: (1) corporations, and the internal political processes that they offer, may serve as an instru- ment in the essential social process of chooszng our direction when we lack consensus-or perhaps, in rare and delightful instances, of dis- covering or coming to a consensus we did not know that we shared; and (2) the process of corporate governance might be so reformed that, quite apart from having the outcome of the process serve broadly shared or otherwise appropriate social goals in particular instances, the process itself in some symbolic way would serve to affirm and rein- force general values and attitudes that those designing the reforma- tion wished to foster in the society. This section of the essay is intended to justify these two exclusions-which is to say, to justify my starting proposition. The two exclusions will be more easily han- dled in reverse order. A. Process To my knowledge, no one has seriously argued that the institu- tions of corporate governance should be designed with a primary fo- cus on matters of process for their own sake. In particular, no one has argued explicitly that "process values" would be served by having corporate managements, either as now constituted or as constituted after any proposed structural reform, engage as part of their internal functions in some kind of ordering of social priorities.81 Such an ar- 81. Actually, the Nader group and other proponents occasionally seem to imply some- thing not far from such an argument. See, e.g., R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp; J. SELIGMAN, supra note 6, at 183 (employee relations); note 82 infra. See a/so Epstein, Societal, Managerial, and Legal Perspectives on Corporate Socia1lResponstibilt-Products and Process, 30 HASTINGS L.J. 1287, 1303-04 (1979). But the theme is not general in the Nader book (nor is it elsewhere) and is not articulated there. While there is something metaphysical going on through much of Tam- ing the Giant Corporation, see note 368 and text accompanying notes 361-68 infra, this theme is not it.</page><page sequence="29">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 29 gument would presumably point to the contribution made to soci- ety's general moral tone every time anybody tries to estimate and value all the consequences of his actions.82 It would point specifically to the threat posed to society's moral tone if a major sector of activi- ties-those engaged in by corporations-were never thought about by the actors in such a way.83 But the argument would run up against at least two serious objections. First, the argument cannot be made independently of the alternative argument we are about to ex- plore-that internal corporate processes, either as now constituted or as reconstituted, can contribute effectively to society's choice of direc- tion when there is no consensus. At least, one would want some as- surance that corporate voluntarism would do no great harm in terms of substantive results before one would be likely to advocate its prac- tice on grounds of moral tone. Second, and more to the point, it is far from clear that all the values and attitudes implicitly affirmed by a process of corporate voluntarism would be desirable. For example, it could be argued that such a process would tend to undercut our sense of management's fiduciary role in general,84 or of the obliga- tions of all fiduciaries, or, to the extent that this has not long ago disintegrated,85 of what it means to own property. In any event, the corporate social responsibility proponents do not explicitly rest the case for management independence of social consensus on pure ques- tions of process, and it would be a work of folly to try to put the case there for them. B. Choostng Soczal Goals The validity of my starting proposition therefore comes to turn on the following question: What substantive contribution can we ex- pect, from internal corporate governance processes, to our choice among social priorities in the absence of consensus? And again, the answer seems easy-at least so long as the structure of corporate gov- ernance remains what it is today. For the opponents of "more" cor- porate social responsibility have made a persuasive case-although they do not pursue nearly all its implications86 that corporate man- 82. See C.

While government is, we are assuming, legitimated (and given fact-gathering and opinion-gathering capabil- ity) to make distributional decisions,88 and while the distributional impact of each zndzv:dual's consumption and investment and almsgiv- ing choices has a very special legitimacy of its own,89 it is persua- sively argued that corporate managements, at least as now structured, are altogether ill-suited to the job of distributing society's riches.90 Nor is there available-however much we might wish there were 91 any system of corporate "ethics" with which a given man- agement can somehow legitimately and competently (but altruisti- tional reconciliation of [shareholder and public] interests rested on the assumption that the general rules of law can be given such form that an enterprise, by aiming at long-run maxi- mum return, will also serve the public interest best.

Id at 104-05 (emphasis added). 87. The core of this case cannot be stated better than by Milton Friedman: "If business- men do have a social responsibility other than making maximum profits for stockholders, how are they to know what it is? Can self-selected private individuals decide what the social interest is? Can they decide how great a burden they are justified in placing on themselves or their stockholders to serve that social interest? Is it tolerable that these public functions of taxation, expenditure, and control be exercised by the people who happen at the moment to be in charge of particular enterprises, chosen for those posts by strictly private groups? If businessmen are civil servants rather than the employees of their stockholders then in a de- mocracy they will, sooner or later, be chosen by the public techniques of election and ap- pointment."

While the opponents sometimes add an argument that current share- holders were promised profit-maximizing behavior when they bought in, this notion is prob- lematic at best, see C.

The wish for guidance from some system of corporate "ethics" is, perhaps surpris- ingly, common ground between the proponents of Nader's stripe, see, e.g., R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp; J. SELIGMAN, subra note 6, at 122 ("avoid exploiting consumers or communities"), and the particular element in the opposition camp that goes under the name of "managerial- ism."

Although this matter is difficult to discuss at a theoretical level without lapsing into jargon, those who have thought most seriously in theoretical terms about the potential contri- bution of business "ethics" to defining a useful role for corporate voluntarism are justifiably pessimistic. See, e.g., Arrow, supra note 20, at 313-17; McKean, Collective Choice, in SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE BUSINESS PREDICAMENT 109 (J. McKie ed. 1974); McKean, Eco- nomics of Trust, A/truism, and Corporate Responsibility, in ALTRUISM, MORALITY, AND ECONOMIC THEORY 29 (E. Phelps ed. 1975). See generall Arrow, GV2s and Exchanges, in ALTRUISM, Mo- RALITY, AND ECONOMIC THEORY 13 (E. Phelps ed. 1975). This pessimism rests on the belief that the substantive areas in which corporate social responsibility is generally demanded tend not to lend themselves to the kind of unambiguous rules necessary for ethical systems to arise; and that these areas tend to change rapidly and to involve conflicts of social interests rather than common social interests, both of which tendencies further reduce the fertility of these areas for the growth of ethical systems. See McKean, Collective Choice, supra, at 124, 132; Mc- Kean, Economics of Trust, A/truism, and Corporate Responsibiioty, supra, at 38-41. See a/so Arrow, supra note 20, at 315. Moreover, beyond these substantive considerations, there is an additional reason for pes- simism about the potential contribution of business "ethics" to our analysis: Even though we are interested in voluntary or altruistic adherence to ethical precepts by some particular cor- poration, an ethical system cannot be expected to arise at all unless generally it is backed by incentives that play on self-interest. See, e.g., McKean, Collective Choice, supra, at 121 ("Unless the rule becomes virtually compulsive, producing social responsibilities in this way is precari- ous-like producing national defense on the basis of voluntary contributions."); McKean, Economics of Trust, Altruism, and Corporate Responsibility, supra, at 32, 35. Certainly, there are substantive areas in which adherence to business "ethics" is encouraged (or compelled) by self-interest, such as performance of most oral, or even merely implicit, promises; and in such areas businessmen do develop effective ethical rules. See, e.g., McKean, Co//ective Choice, supra, at 122-23. See generally Macaulay, Non-Contractual Relations in Business. A Prelitmnay Study, 28 AM. Soc. REV. 55 (1963). But in such areas the self-interested mechanisms of enforcement tend to be so efficient that altruistic adherence to the ethical scheme is not even an important topic for discussion. But see McKean, Economics of Trust, Altruism, and Corporate Responsibility, supra, at 31. By contrast, in those substantive areas where the corporate social responsibility debate tends rightly to focus, general enforceability-and therefore formulation-of any ethi- cal system is undercut by free-rider problems. In fact, the presence of such problems is per- haps the salient characteristic of the substantive areas in question. Thus, however enthusiastic one particular corporation might be about voluntarily adhering to ethical norms in such an area, there are likely to be no norms to which to adhere. See id. at 40-41. And this problem is only aggravated by general social trends that may reduce the likelihood of enforce- ment-and therefore the likelihood of formulation-of ethical systems. See McKean, Co//ective Choice, supra, at 124-25, 132. While it would be an exaggeration to rule out all possibility of one corporation volunta- rily following an ethical precept that most corporations follow by compulsion, see, e.g., Arrow, supra note 20, at 313-17; McKean, Collective Choic, supra, at 125, it is difficult to imagine important situations conducive to such altruism which would not involve either: (1) the spe- cial problems of explicit intercorporate cooperation, which may be required for the formula- tion of a reasonably precise ethical rule absent general enforceability (these special problems are mentioned at note 78 supra); or (2) sufficient imprecision in the rule-arising from its partial unenforceability, if nothing else-that voluntary "obedience" could only be viewed as a specialized case of management indulging its own taste for charitable acts. See, e.g., Arrow, supra note 20, at 315-16; McKean, Collective Choice, supra, at 132-33; McKean, Economics of Trust, A/truism, and Corporate Responsibility, supra, at 32. See also Vagts, supra note 53, at 46-47.</page><page sequence="32">32 STANFORID LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 and certainly the case most prominently made today93-is that the structure of corporate governance can and should be reformed in such a way that either individuals or processes within it wilI be able and inclined to make substantive contributions to our choice among so- cial priorities in the absence of consensus.94 The range of structural proposals that have been suggested to this end is as broad as the cor- porate social responsibility literature itself. The board (or other cor- porate organs) might be composed of directors selected by, and 93. One also hears the argument that management as currently structured can contrib- ute to the choice of social goals. But, unsurprisingly, this argument is not made by the propo- nents of reform in the name of corporate social responsibility. Rather, it is advanced by the "managerialist" school of apologetics for current management structures-and in particular of apologetics for whatever "balancing" of social interests is engaged in by current manage- ments. See note 91 supra. See generally note 14 supra and accompanying text. James McKie has described the core of managerialist philosophy as follows: "If one word can describe the conception . . . it is 'trusteeship.' The large corporation is thought of as aptermanent institution, not merely an extension of its proprietors, and is assumed to have a life and purpose of its own, involving both its internal constituencies and the groups with which it must deal. The manager/trustees believe that they should not (and in fact cannot) run these large organizations in the interests of only one of those constituencies-the (largely absentee) owners. Employees, customers, suppliers, and other parties have rights in the organization that are not merely contractual claims." McKie, Changing Views, in SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE BUSINESS PREDICAMENT 17, 30 (I. McKie ed. 1974). See generall RESEARCH AND POLICY COMMITTEE, supra note 91. See a/so L. SILK &amp; D. VOGEL, supra note 58, at 144-46. The philosophy is subject to all the criticisms we have been exploring. See Kaysen, supra note 66, at 99. Even so and rather astonishingly, the management of Control Data Corpora- tion, for example, has invoked "managerialism" in proxy soliciation materials as a justifica- tion for antitakeover corporate structural changes meant to exclude profit-maximizing outsiders. Control Data Corp., Notice of 1978 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 4 (Mar. 20, 1978), quoted in Small, The Evolving Role of the Director in Corporate Governance, 30 HASTINCS L.J. 1353, 1362-63 (1979). Defenders of managerialism frequently argue that in the long enough run it always amounts to the same thing as profit-maximization. See, e.g., RESEARCH AND POLICY COM- MITTEE, supra note 91, at 25. See a/so note 314 infra. Certainly, any lengthening of manage- ment's time horizon is likely also to broaden the interests management considers as bearing on each decision it must make. Indeed, structural reforms to lengthen time horizons may well be the most significant improvement that could be made in corporate governance. See generally note 36 supra. But to suggest that the management time horizon can ever be long enough to make shareholder interests identical with some "balanced" mix of constituency interests is to wish for a world with less real conflict than ours. See note 30 supra. Revealingly enough-and precisely as with the nostalgic wish for some system of corpo- rate "ethics," see notes 91-92 supra-the pretense that a lengthening of time horizons is the same thing as increased voluntarism is shared by some of the managerialists with less-than- candid utterances from some of the corporate social responsibility reform proponents. See generally text accompanying notes 343-423 infra. See also note 314 infra. While one may de- bate the frequency or level of importance with which the distinction matters operationally to management, see note 30 supra, the blurring of the two issues in theory seems to me simply avoidance (by each side) of a hard theoretical question.

(4) Will members of specialized constituencies, or those they tend to choose as representatives, have manage- ment skills relevant to serving on the corporate board?

C. The Pro/t-Maxzmzza on Proxv As I started the previous section by suggesting, public corpora- tions should pursue only goals whose pursuit by corporations is sup- ported by broad public consensus. The goals incorporated in the profit-maximization proxy are the ones most obviously likely to fulfill this requirement. In the absence of market imperfections, this could quite plausibly be argued even without resort to our general assump- tions about legislative legitimacy. That is, absent market imperfec- tions, pursuit of maximum profits would be the corporation's well- directed contribution to society's search for Paredo-op mahiy'?'-one social goal whose pursuit by corporations presumably has consensus support if anything does.102 Whether or not this would be persua- sive, the argument must be refined slightly because of the imperfec- tion of markets; but, so long as one accepts the general assumptions of this essay,103 the argument remains forceful: Insofar as the profit- maximization proxy fails at any time to direct corporate energies down routes supported by social consensus, the legislature has the power, at least in theory, to modify the profit consequences of any given corporate action, so as to nudge corporate behavior in the di- rection society prefers.104 The initial failure of the profit-maximiza- that their differences be worked out in the relative privacy of the board room rather than in public confrontation and accommodation?

The general difficulties of the other types of proposals-government or shareholder selec- tion of "constituency" or "public interest" representatives, see notes 96-97 supra-are ex- plored in some detail, in the particular context of the Nader and Stone proposals, at text accompanying notes 343-423 nfia.

Pareto-optimality is the economist's description of any social situation in which no person could be made better off without some other person being made worse off. Thus, a situation is not pareto-optimal if one member's lot in the society could be improved suffi- ciently that he would be willing to compensate all other members for costs imposed on them by improving his situation. See P. SAMUELSON, ECONOMICS 462 n. 12 (10th ed. 1976). 102. See text accompanying notes 212-14 znfra. 103. See text accompanying notes 7-9 supra. 104. See text accompanying note 31 supra. In the abstract, this would be true of any precisely defined proxy-goal-not just profit maximization-that corporations were in- structed and structured to pursue. It does not seem to me arbitrary, however, to single out this trait of profit maximization at the outset of our analysis. Most fundamentally, a gener- ally shared assessment that zndivzduals tend to try to maximize their own economic welfare makes the economic-maximization proxy the usual mode of implementing rules of general application. While corporations could be given a different goal to pursue, and every new</page><page sequence="35">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 35 tion proxy would most likely be due to market imperfections, but conceivably also might result from society's wish to use corporate mechanisms to redistribute wealth, or perhaps even to accomplish goals that are in some sense "noneconomic.5"'05 Whatever the source of the perceived shortcomings in the profit-maximization proxy, the. legislature can enact liability rules, regulatory provisions backed by criminal sanctions, or other measures, to correct the shortcomings. At least as a first, rough presumption, the profit-maximization proxy at any given time may be taken to reflect-with more or less appro- priate relative weights-the complex of social goals that society through its chosen representatives has decided that corporations should pursue. Moreover, the profit-maximization proxy communi- cates to corporate managements with relative clarity information about which available corporate actions are and are not likely to fur- ther society's chosen goals. Certainly management may try to maxi- mize profits and yet fail; and certainly the legislature may try to reflect a given social goal in the profit-maximization proxy and fail at that.106 But in a broad range of situations, it is not hard to argue that the idea of profit-maximization gives corporations a reasonably accurate and clear signal of what society wants them to do. A corporation that unremittingly pursued maximum profits would not, of course, be practicing social responsibility in our sense of the phrase. Therefore, given my starting proposition that public corporations should pursue only those social goals clearly signalled to them as supported by a social consensus, the central question of this essay-whether and when corporate voluntarism may be socially de- sirable-reduces to this: Are there other social goals, besides (or more accurately, instead of) those reflected in the profit-maximiza- tion proxy, whose pursuit by corporations is supported by broad so- cial consensus, and whose dictates as applied to particular corporate decisions are signalled to management with reasonable clarity? While questions not unlike this have occasionally been posed in substantive social policy could carefully be fed by the legislature into that goal as well as into the economic goals typically sought by individuals, this does not seem intuitively to be the simplest way for the legislature to do things. Moreover, the long history of government acting through the profit-maximization proxy suggests-even apart from the possibility that that proxy may have some inherent merits-the enormity of the initial job of infusing some new proxy-goal with all the information now conveyed by the profit signal. Finally, at least one of the frequently noted inherent merits of the profit-maximization proxy is worth explicit men- tion: At its best, it is a very precise method of communication.

V. OUTLINE OF THE INQUIRY Two problems arise immediately when one sets out to find social goals, not incorporated-or not given some particular weight-in the profit-maximization proxy, whose pursuit by corporations is sup- ported by public consensus. First, one has to ask why any given goal, if in fact the object of a social consensus, has not been placed or given sufficient weight by the legislature in the profit-maximization proxy. One cannot persuasively claim to have found an extra-profit goal that society wants corporations to pursue, unless one can offer at least a plausible explanation of why the legislature did not long ago enact liability rules, regulations, or other measures, to implement the goal in question quite independently of any management practice of so- cial responsibility.108 Second, even if plausible explanations of legis- lative oversight or failure are forthcoming-and even if the argument, that a social consensus exists on which the legislature has not (yet) acted, is in other respects persuasive-the question arises how the corporation is to know at any given moment what actions on its part are or are not justified by the social goal in question.109 The most promising arguments with which the corporate social responsibility proponents might try to obviate these two problems, would have to run in terms of some kind of implicit legislative "ap- proval." The proponents' best case would seem to be a situation in which, despite legislative failure-or at least failure to date-to have reflected a particular social goal in the profit-maximization proxy, 107. See, e.g., notes 20, 44 supra; text accompanying notes 217-20 znfra.

If this construction of the facts were persuasive in a given situation, then voluntary corporate pursuit of the goal in question would in- deed seem to be a socially desirable instance of corporate altruism. Part VI of the essay 1O will explore the possibility of implicit legis- lative approval of a given piece of corporate voluntarism before the corporation takes the voluntary action at issue. Part VIlll' will ex- plore the possibility of subsequent legislative ratification of an altruistic decision by management. I believe that parts of the subsequent-rati- fication argument might provide the proponents' strongest case, al- though they have not made it in these terms. As a crucial transition between these two inquiries, and an equally crucial issue in its own right, Part VIIPI2 will ask whether cases ever arise in which, despite the absence of any argument of prior or subsequent legislative ap- proval of corporate voluntarism, an altruistic corporate act may be reasonably clearly called for by a consensus social goal. I will suggest that such cases are rare at best, and are most likely to arise at times of temporary social emergency. VI. LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL BEFORE THE FACT If the legislature has purported to attach civil or criminal liability to (or to retain such liability for) a particular piece of behavior, then there is, under our assumptions, a public consensus that such behav- ior should be reduced. It might be argued that the nominal level of liability the legislature chooses to attach to the behavior represents the estimated cost to society, not otherwise visited on the actor, each time the behavior is practiced.' 13 That is, if there were a law on the books saying I owed each of my two next door neighbors $50 each time I lit a cigarette, then it might be argued that the public had decided each cigarette ignition was costing the society $100 beyond the expenses borne by the smoker himself. (The expenses borne by the smoker himself are likely to include some loss of good will in his 110. See text accompanying notes 113-209 rnfra. 111. See text accompanying notes 271-342 zn/ia. 112.

As I have already mentioned, see text accompanying note 7 supra, and as will be- come increasingly apparent in the immediately succeeding pages, this essay will generally assume that there is no reliable indicator of legislative will other than the legislature's adop- tion of or failure to adopt remedies.</page><page sequence="38">38 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 community.1 14) If it turned out, further, that as a practical matter my neighbors could not be aware of most of the occasions on which I smoked, or could not prove most such occasions, or could not prove them without considerable expense, or could not collect on them from me because I was insolvent-in any of these cases the legislature would not have imposed on me the full $100-per-cigarette social cost ostensibly identified by the statute or rule of law. Unless I were to practice some degree of altruism, the statute's presence on the books would not cause me to take into account, in deciding whether or not to smoke at any given moment, the full $100 of cost I would presum- ably be imposing on others. Rather, the costs I would need to antici- pate having charged to me under the statute (even assuming I were solvent) would be $100 multiplied by some fraction representing the average probability that a neighbor will catch a smoker, be able to prove the incident, and bother to spend what it takes to go to court." 15 Now if the liability rule did in fact represent a legislative judg- ment that the social cost of each of my cigarettes (beyond my own expenses) was $100, then I would be in a position to identify an altru- istic act on my part that would be reasonably clearly called for by a consensus goal. The altruistic act would be, each time I was consid- ering lighting a cigarette, to ask myself not "Is this worth the chance of getting spotted by a neighbor, hauled into court, and held liable for $100?", but rather "Is this cigarette worth $100 to me?"1"6 If one then merely substitutes a corporation's factory smokestack for my cigarette, and a board of directors for myself, one might claim to have a case where legislatively ordered social priorities reasonably clearly call for a particular act of corporate altruism. That is, the board should deem the legally imposed cost of each furnace ignition to the corporation to be fully $100, rather than whatever fraction of $100 is represented by the actual chance of getting caught and held liable. 17 114. What is more, embodiment of a social norm against imposing smoke on others into a criminal or tort rule is likely to increase the amount of good will lost by each violation. See note 144 inoa. But the $100 would presumably be the external costs net of all this. 115. I have been casual in text about the difference between being pursued by one neighbor or by both, and about my own transaction costs in defending a lawsuit. I trust the basic point is clear. 116. Moreover, even if my answer to this second question were "yes," there would still be a possible altruistic act on my part arguably sanctioned by the legislative enactment-to smoke the cigarette but to give my neighbors the $100 voluntarily.

Actually, analysis along these lines seems more directly in</page><page sequence="39">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 39 To make the argument in this form is, of course, to glide over a number of severe difficulties. Exploration of these difficulties will be best conducted separately for each of two types of liabilities. We will first consider liabilities whose dollar levels are set (at least ostensibly and approximately) by legislative fiat for whole classes of cases- whether the fixed dollar amounts be criminal fines (which are typi- cally more or less of this nature'18), or civil penalties such as the ciga- rette example just mentioned or the commonly discussed schemes for taxing pollution.119 Second, we will consider liabilities whose levels explicitly depend on the amount of damage caused in each in- stance-as is the case with most ordinary civil liabilities. Under either of these two categories of liabilities, there are three primary reasons that nominal penalty levels for corporate violations may in fact not be fully visited upon the stockholders: (1) the corpo- rate acts may not be detected; (2) the transaction costs of establishing liability may exceed the amount nominally due successful private plaintiffs or the potential benefit perceived by the public prosecutor; or (3) the nominal liability may bankrupt the corporation, in which case the rule of limited liability will protect the shareholders. The case of civil liability for a polluting smokestack is illustrative. If the penalty for pollution were solely that of liability for damages, then the significance of that penalty would be reduced by the possibilities that: (1) the pollution might not be detected; (2) the damage to each of the factory's neighbors might be too slight or too difficult to prove to warrant a lawsuit, and a class action might be too cumbersome to pursue or might have other problems;120 and (3) if the only harm done by the smokestack's pollution would be the imposition of a risk that several million people would die of a rare disease (or that the ionosphere would be destroyed), then the legal protection of share- holders from unlimited liability might prevent the board from taking full social costs into account. 121 Each of these three possible sources point for a corporate actor than for an individual-since the individual's decision whether to behave altruistically involves crucial considerations not captured by the example, such as the amount of pleasure he may take in self-sacrifice. See note 66 and text accompanying notes 59-65 supra. 118. The same can be said, in effect, of prison terms. 119. See, e.g., W. BAXTER, PEOPLE OR PENGUINS, 73-110 (1974). 120. See generally L. Goldman, Environmental Pollution and Voluntary Corporate So- cial Responsibility (1978) (unpublished paper on file with author). 121. Even in theory, the limited liability rule would not prevent the board from consid- ering direct physical danger from the contemplated pollution to the shareholders themselves or, realistically, to the board members themselves. Nor could the board members help but consider the professional damage to themselves from any such disaster-in effect, a personal loss of good will not limited to the firm's capitalization. See note 114 supra and accompanying</page><page sequence="40">40 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 of shareholder insulation from nominal penalty levels will require some separate consideration-as it bears on each of the two general categories of fixed and unfixed liabilities. In light of all this, the remainder of this part of the essay will most conveniently be organized into four subsections: (A) nondetection or nonprosecution in the case of flat-amount liabilities; (B) nondetection or nonprosecution of ordinary civil liabilities; (C) limited shareholder liability as insulation from any type of penalty; and (D) tentative conclusions whether any case for corporate voluntarism made out in the first three subsections is strong enough to provide any justifica- tion for governance reforms of public corporations-such as the mandatory introduction of public interest directors. A. Nondetection or Nonprosecution of Flat-Amount Liabilities The cigarette-ignition hypothetical with which I began this part of the essay-and the argument based on it122-has most direct ap- plication where the legislature sets an arbitrary level of penalty meant to apply, at least in theory, to each instance of a given type of conduct without explicit dependence on the amount of damage actu- ally caused in a given case.'23 Whether such a flat-amount penalty is criminal'24 or civil,125 it provides an ostensibly unambiguous dollar amount of liability for a given action. This makes it possible to argue that society, through its elected representatives, has reached a collec- tive judgment that the damage from each such action shall be deemed text. But legislative imposition of a criminal or tort penalty suggests a judgment that a larger social cost needs to be communicated clearly to the board, and it then becomes relevant that the legislated penalty would not be visited fully on the shareholders. 122. See text accompanying notes 113-17 supra. 123. Various parts of the legal system retain considerable discretion to temper such an arbitrary penalty in most situations. Even so, the explicit penalty level may be significant; indeed, a given statute may seek to deny discretion over penalty in a given substantive area. And even short of a total denial of discretion, various regulatory schemes-such as statutory restrictions on judicial sentencing discretion-try in various ways to give real significance to the statutory level of penalty. Punitive or treble damages appended to civil liabilities cause an analogous severance of the level of punishment from the level of damage imposed in a particular instance. See R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 142-43; text accompanying notes 128-29 infra. However, punitive damages do not inform the potential "wrongdoer," before the fact, of an arbitrary level of penalty that can be counted upon. 124. See note 118 supra and accompanying text. 125. See note 119 supra and accompanying text. The usual criminal/civil line between publicly and privately prosecuted actions will not be altogether irrelevant for our purposes. See text accompanying notes 142-59 znfra. On the relationship between this criminal/civil line on the one hand, and the line between flat-amount and damage-related liabilities on the other, see R.

It could be argued that this legislative effort sanctions an altru- istic decision by corporate management always to deem $X a cost of the relevant conduct-even if the conduct might well escape detec- tion or prosecution. 27 Even in the case of flat-amount liabilities such as a pollution tax or criminal fines, the argument in this form is not persuasive. For the argument ignores, among other things, the likelihood that the nomi- nal level of X will be set above the external social costs of the conduct at issue,128 because of the possibility of nondetection or nonprosecu- tion. If one accepts the purely economic model of the criminal law129-which surely contains significant insights for our purposes- then the legislature's estimate of external social costs is the product of $X and the probability of detection and conviction.130 Manage- ment's knowledge of the level of X, without also knowing the legisla- ture's estimate of this probability, tells the corporation nothing. More extremely (and indeed indefensibly131) put-and ignoring the problem of variations in degree of risk aversion 132-the legislature has presumably set X high enough so that the average manage- 126. See text accompanying note 7 supra. The level of X, in theory, could be set high enough to approximate not only direct damage from each criminal act, but also, at least in an appropriate case, various costs to the system caused by the defendant's substitution of a legal battle for what could have been a market transaction. See R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 165-66; Calabresi &amp; Melamed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienabilit: One View of the Cathedral, 85 HARV. L. REV. 1089, 1125-26 (1972). These costs arise both from the difficulty of putting a price on some things other than through the market, and from sheer administra- tive expense. They could also conceivably be calculated to include social costs from perceived flouting of the criminal law. See Calabresi &amp; Malamed, supra, at 1103-04, 1126. See generally text accompanying notes 157-59 infra. 127. On the applicability of this argument where $X exceeds the corporation's net worth, so that the penalty will never be fully exacted from the shareholders, see text accompa- nying notes 201-07 infra. 128.

Man- agement should not disregard the probability of nondetection or nonprosecution, because the legislature, in setting the level of X, as- sumed that management would consider these things. 135 Fortunately for the proponents of corporate social responsibility, however, this economic model of the criminal law is itself far from totally persuasive. 136 For one thing, it is disingenuous to accept the legislature's enactments as an accurate benchmark of appropriate be- havior, while at the same time assuming deliberate corporate con- cealment of conduct whose public announcement might lead to more severe or different legislative reaction. Nondetection of a corporate violation of law may have two effects: First, the particular corpora- tion whose conduct escapes detection cannot be prosecuted for it under current law; but second, concealment of the conduct may cause the legislature to underestimate the general level of the unde- sired activity in the society. Even if one were persuaded that the escape of some corporate conduct from prosecution never calls for corporate altruism because the legislature factors it into the penalty, the second effect is precisely one of legislative error, and may well be a basis for asking for some corporate voluntarism. However, at least as an initial matter, the form of voluntarism thus called for would seem to be altruistic dzsclosure137 rather than substantive abstention from disfavored conduct.138 As it happens, if a corporate manage- ment were persuaded to practice some voluntarism by this kind of case for altruistic disclosure, they would very likely end up practicing 133. See note 135 tnfra. 134. See text accompanying notes 151-55 infra. 135. This argument seems forceful enough to destroy any notion that management would automatically be justified in altruistically considering legislative flat-amount penalty levels as costs of the burdened conduct. But I certainly do not present the argument as a model of suggested corporate behavior-even less as a model of individual behavior. See note 66 supra. If so presented, the argument would justify firms with comparative advantages in secrecy in spending less on, say, control of employee crime than firms whose conduct is some- how more visible. The various flaws in the argument, about to be discussed in text, demon- strate that it cannot carry us nearly that far. But the core insight about meaning attributable to an explicit penalty level remains. The matter would be more complicated still if corporations did regularly practice some of the kind of voluntarism we are discussing here, and if the legislature counted on that in setting the penalty level. 136.

And because altruistic disclosure is different from substantive obedience to the dictates of legislative rules, I will post- pone discussion of it to Part VIII. 140 It is rather a different failing of the economic model of the crimi- nal law that may be thought to support a case for substantive corpo- rate voluntarism: Whatever the maximum level to which we are willing to raise the probability of detection and conviction of a given crime or, for example, instance of pollution, we may refrain, for a variety of reasons, from then setting the penalty for violation high enough so that its product with the detection/conviction probability accurately reflects external social costs.141 The general reluctance of many individual actors in the society to commit (particularly) 139. See note 263 infra. But see notes 200, 318 rnfra. The relative cost to the corporation, as between substantive abstention and after-the-fact altruistic disclosure, depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of generic disclosure. See text accompanying notes 308-1 1 znfra. And, in fact, such factors bear also on the question of which form of corporate altruism is more productive from society's viewpoint. See note 264 znfra and accompanying text. 140. See texts accompanying notes 271--82, 294-342 infra. 141. Legislative reluctance to set criminal penalties as high as would be required by the pure economic model could arise for any of a number of reasons. There is, first, the intracta- ble problem of ex post fairness, and the concomitant problem of judge, jury, or prosecutor nullification. See note 149 infra. Closely related, there is also the problem of social and eco- nomic adjustment, after the fact, of those violators unfortunate enough to be caught and penalized to the full extent of the statutory authorization. Third, as we will note later, see note 149 infra, it may be necessary to limit the penalties for minor offenses, so that the law will have some incentive in reserve to discourage minor offenders from expanding to major crimes. See R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 170-71. And finally, problems of risk aversion, see M. Polin- sky &amp; S. Shavell, supra note 136, and, I might add, of enormous interpersonal variations in degree of risk aversion, vastly complicate the proposed economic analysis. It also seems to me that the proposed reform usually advocated as an outgrowth of such economic analysis-catching fewer criminals and punishing those caught much more se- verely-puts inordinate pressure on the accuracy of the government's projection of its appre- hension rate for a given category of crime with a given investment of law enforcement resources. If the proposed policy approach were pursued, a small absolute (percentage-point) error in the projected apprehension rate would be an enormous percentage error, and could have terrifying consequences. All these observations-and the likelihood that the level of criminal penalties will not be as high as called for by the economic theory-are reinforced if the criminal penalty needs to be calculated with an eye to the indirect, see text accompanying notes 157-59 infra, as well as the direct, harms of each violation.</page><page sequence="44">44 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 crimes42 -a reluctance not fully explicable in terms of probability of detection/conviction and explicit penalties-somewhat compensates for this shortfall in punishment. It might well be argued that we need some equivalent compensation by corporate actors in their own spheres of operations; that is, that we want them-at least some- times-to obey, for example, substantive criminal laws-or to spend money to keep lower-echelon employees within the laws 143 -beyond the point dictated by profit-maximization.144 But this just brings us back to the recurrent question: How is management to know when voluntary law-obedience is called for-or how much to spend beyond profit-maximizing investment on internal audit systems? One can imagine three possible responses from the proponents of corporate voluntarism-the first two of which are largely restricted to cases where the flat-amount penalty is criminal. Each of the three requires separate treatment. 1. Optimal level of zero. First, the proponents might argue that we criminalize only those acts that we do not want performed in the society at all-regardless of cost. It is probably the perceived force of this argument, more than any other single factor, that explains why pleas are so much more common for voluntary corporate obedience of the criminal law than for any other particular form of corporate social responsibil- ity. 45 Yet the argument is even more extreme than the one based on the cigarette-ignition hypothetical;146 and indeed, as a matter of ob- servation, the argument is simply not right.147 142. This argument may apply also to flat-amount civil liabilities, but it is most forceful as applied to crimes. 143. See text accompanying notes 151-55 inJfa. 144. Of course, to a significant extent we obtain corporate law-obedience beyond that called for by the expected value of penalties to be imposed, simply because it may be unprof- itable in the long run to acquire a reputation as a law-breaker. See note 114 supra and accom- panying text. Such a reputation may hurt the corporation in consumer markets, employee (particularly executive) recruiting, and dealings with the government. But in order for the argument to raise a question of corporate social responsibility, it has to mean something more than this. 145. Even Milton Friedman believes that the "social responsibility of business" includes "stay[ing] within the rules of the game, which is to say, engag[ing] in open and free competi- tion, without deception or fraud." M. FRIEDMAN, supra note 87, at 133. 146. See text accompanying notes 113-17 supra. 147. To the degree that the SEC's approach in the questionable payments area, see note 58 supra; note 155 rnfra-and to a much lesser extent in the area of management perquisites, see note 58 supra-has tended toward an assumption that all lawbreaking by corporate em- ployees is both bad and worth trying to stop, see text accompanying notes 151-55 infra, the</page><page sequence="45">November 1979] CORPORA TE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 45 It is not right, first of all, even as applied to an individual actor cold-bloodedly contemplating a violation of the criminal law. In an emergency, or where the costs of law-obedience are otherwise high enough, we do not view the laws against trespass or larceny or bur- glary or even homicide as absolutes whose generalized prohibitions should never be violated. And while we may try to enumerate many of the instances of anticipated justified "violation" as explicit, sub- stantive exceptions to the criminal liability at issue, we do not expect such enumerations to be exhaustive.148 We supplement such enu- merations by keeping the punishment for criminal violations finite. While we might refrain from imposing capital punishment for tres- pass for other reasons as well,149 one important reason for variable punishment among crimes is precisely the likelihood of unenumer- ated justifications. 150 But what is more, the argument that the socially optimal level of crime is zero seems particularly infirm in the corporate context. For there, except in the rare case where the board of directors systemati- cally sanctions a criminal act or pattern of action by the corporation, every attempt by top management to reduce corporate crime in- volves the rather special costs of internal policy-promulgation, moni- toring, and enforcement. It is not plausible to argue that every substantive crime represents a legislative judgment that every corpo- ration should spend an infinzte amount on an internal auditing system to ensure that none of its employees engages in the prohibited con- duct. And yet as soon as the argument is diluted at all from this proposition, a moralistic approach to the meaning of substantive criminal law gives no guidance as to how much a corporation should spend to reduce lower-echelon crime.151 As it happens, these special characteristics of corporate crime also give the legislature a special opportunity to convey information about desired conduct. In addition to establishing criminal penalties for substantive behavior (such as discrimination in employment), the conclusion I am suggesting in text throws real doubt on the sense of the Commission's ap- proach. 148. See R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 166. 149. For example, if most unjustified trespassers are not detected, imposition of the death penalty on those who are caught might strike us as unfair in result-or might strike juries that way, so that they would simply refuse to enforce the law. See note 150 infra. Again, if trespass carried the death penalty, the trespasser who had been spotted would have little incentive to avoid murder while trying to effect his escape. See note 141 supra. 150. The likelihood of unenumerated justifications may also help to explain pros- ecutorial discretion. 151. But see note 135 supra.</page><page sequence="46">46 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 legislature can seek to define explicitly the appropriate amount of ef- fort that corporate managements should put into the attempt to eliminate such behavior by employees. This is precisely what new section 13(b) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act sets out to do.152 But, again, it is hard to read sections such as 13(b) (2) independently of the penalties that the legislature establishes for cases where the section is violated.'53 While one could argue that passage of section 13(b)(2) represents advance legislative approval of all management expendi- tures-including altruistic ones-to control employee wrongdoing up to the level of expenditure explicitly defined in the section, the argu- ment is not very helpful. For it amounts to a claim that section 13(b)(2) is one law whose violation is never socially desirable-a law whose scope of coverage is so precisely "enumerated" that the level of penalty attached to its violation conveys no additional information about the legislature's substantive intent.154 And this claim is refuted by the section's language and legislative history.155 152.

Indirect social costs of criminal viola/ion. The corporate social responsibility proponents might therefore turn in a second direction in their attempt to give management some guidance as to how altruistic it should be on account of the likely shortfall of (especially) criminal penalties from their socially optimal level. They might argue that the costs to society of each criminal violation exceed those associated directly with the conduct at issue. The costs may include, for example: (1) costs to the system when the legislative will is visibly flouted; and more generally, (2) costs to the system by virtue of defendant's having substituted a legal battle for what could have been a market transaction.157 The argument might conclude that management should altruistically take at least these special costs into account in deciding how much effort to make against corporate crime.

And this suggestion is signifi- cantly reinforced by examination of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as a whole; for even within the Act itself, the substantive antibribery provisions, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, ? 103(a), 15 U.S.C.A. ? 78dd-1 (West Supp. 1979) (amending Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. ?? 78a-78kk (1976)), were accompanied by new and unusually severe criminal penalties, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, ? 103(b)(2), 15 U.S.C.A. ? 78ff(c)(1) (West Supp. 1979) (amending Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. ?? 78a-78kk (1976)), while the accounting provisions were not.

To be sure, the argument is rather persuasive that the optimal level would be high enough to take account of the indirect as well as the direct harms of each violation. And this observation rein- forces the conclusion that the actual level of criminal penalties is likely to be lower than the optimum.'58 But it is hard to see how such a refined qualitative analysis of the shortfall in penalty helps a given corporate management to quantify that shortfall. The legisla- ture would seem much better suited to estimating the indirect harms of criminal violations than private economic actors such as corpora- tions.159 And the mere fact that the legislature may then be to some degree disabled from acting on its own estimates does not enhance the ability of corporate managements to assess indirect harms. The most graphic suggestion of the flaws in the argument that management should consider indirect social costs of crime-as well as the flaws in the more extreme argument that preceded it, that the legislature criminalizes only that which it does not want done at all- is probably provided by an observation that gets too much weight in the public debate, but is still worthy of mention: Some substantive criminal prohibitions may be "honored in the breach" and the legis- lature may be well aware of this. Legislative failure to act on such knowledge may raise considerable doubt that the current level of penalty understates the legislature's substantive intentions at all. 3. Altrusztic itnernatizatzon of ditect social costs. The corporate social responsibility proponents might finally ar- gue-no longer restricting themselves to the criminal context-that management's guidance as to how far penalty levels fall short of the social optimum must come from management's own estimate of the direct social costs of each instance of corporate lawbreaking. The existence of a criminal or flat-amount civil liability rule would not be irrelevant in this connection; but we will see that its relevance would come from its explicit substantive content rather than from the osten- sibly unambiguous level of its penalty provision.160 Once manage- ment is estimating costs for itself, the argument of the proponents has pulled loose from any anchor in legislative establishment of an un- 158. The argument also increases the danger, at least insofar as the indirect harms may be generalized across various types of crimes, that the optimal level of penalty for violations of a section like 13(b)(2) may exceed the level that the legislature feels able to enact.

This final argument of the proponents will, therefore, be considered in the next section.'63 In sum, there does not seem to be any persuasive class of cases, peculiar to situations where the legislature sets a flat-amount (or in particular a criminal) liability, in which corporate management re- ceives a clear signal that it should practice altruism in the form of particular voluntary expenditures on obedience'64 of substantive'65 legal rules. B. Aondeleclion or Nonprosecution of Ordinary Ctivl Liabib/iahs Where the level of liability explicitly depends on the amount of damage caused by each violation-as is the case with most ordinary civil liabilities'66-it seems even plainer that the only quantitative signal corporate management may be said to receive, as to the desira- bility of altruistic adherence to substantive legal norms, is its own estimate of the social costs of each violation. For one thing, in the absence of criminalization it seems almost impossible to argue that the existence of a liability rule represents a legislative judgment that the optimal level of the disfavored activity in the society is zero.'67 And, obviously, any information arguably conveyed to corporate management by the level of a legislated flat-amount penalty'68 is un- available where the penalty depends on damage caused.

Once management is estimating social costs for itself, has the argu- ment pulled loose not only from any anchor in flat-amount (or par- ticularly criminal) liability rules,170 but from any connection with the presence of a legal rule at all? Has it become a general argument that the explicit goal of corporate management should be not profit- maximization, but maximum contribution to social welfare? I do not believe that the argument for management assessment of direct'7' social costs of law violation needs to go this far; the presence of a rule of law does make a difference. Nevertheless, the argument for altruistic adherence to liability rules does not seem generally per- suasive. I will try to develop in turn my reasons for each of these two views. 1. Presence of a /abihzy rule. Legislative enactment or toleration of a liability rule, whether civil or criminal, may give management two kinds of help in any endeavor to modify corporate behavior in accordance with perceived social costs. First, the rule may represent a judgment by society that, within the area of conduct governed by the rule, it may be appropri- ate for private parties to make, in a sense, what an economist would call interpersonal utility comparisons. The rule may be thought to give legislative sanction to the notion that, in some particular sphere of activity, it can make social sense for actor X in some manner to weigh harms to bystander Y against his own benefits before deciding how to behave. In the simplest case, if the rule is a straightforward one of liability for damages, and if the probability of detection and successful prosecution of any violation is 1,172 the legislature has de- cided and successfully established by law that the conduct in ques- tion should be practiced only when the actor's dollar benefits exceed the bystander's dollar costs.'73 When the penalty level is not simply mating social costs, see text accompanying notes 160-63 supra, the argument so far suggests that the discussion to follow is in fact dispositive of both categories of cases-flat-amount pen- alties and those variable with damage caused. 170. See text accompanying notes 160-63 supra. 171. See text accompanying notes 157-60 supra. 172. I am omitting consideration of transaction costs. 173. Similarly, if the rule is one of flat-amount liability to members of a given plaintiff class, as in my cigarette-ignition hypothetical, see text accompanying notes 113-17 supra, and</page><page sequence="51">November 1979] CORPORA TE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 51 that of damages caused, or when, as always, the probability of detec- tion and successful prosecution is less than 1, it may become much harder to say what kind of interpersonal utility comparison the legisla- ture may have thought appropriate.174 But the presence of the rule may still be thought to suggest that some such comparison is deemed sensible by a legislatively expressed consensus-that the society would not deem it incoherent for management to say, "We're going to pass up a possible profit here, because the harm we would do to others in earning it would in some sense exceed our gain." In the absence of a legislative rule, it would be necessary for the corporate social responsibility proponents to make out some other case for the coherence of this kind of analysis.175 Second, and closely related to this, the rule of law seems to sanc- tion an approach by management to cost estimation, for the particu- lar class of conduct, that excludes all costs and benefits other than those experienced by (1) the corporation itself, and (2) the classes of persons protected by the rule.'76 Proponents of voluntarism might argue that the presence of a legal rule much simplifies the task of estimating social cost, by telling management that if it takes into ac- count Y's costs in particular, either these will be an effective proxy for total external social costs or the other external social costs do not matter very much. Consider, for example, the situation under this reasoning of a corporation contemplating the introduction of an im- proved product line that will: (a) infringe a patent held by Y'; (b) in open competition drive competing producer Y2 out of business; and (c) bring a great deal of pleasure to millions of purchasers and their friends. The structure of legal rules in our society may suggest a leg- if the probability of detection and successful prosecution of any violation is 1, then the legisla- ture has decided (and successfully established by law) that the conduct in question should be practiced only when the actor's dollar benefits exceed the flat-amount liability figure multi- plied by the number of members of the plaintiff class. In any case like the one described in this footnote or the one just described in text, at least if the liability includes the possibility of private damage actions, the legislature has made and successfully implemented an additional judgment beyond the one that a prospective ac- tor should make interpersonal utility comparisons: Even if the actor decides to go ahead with the contemplated activity, some compensation should be paid to those harmed, as a pure distrzbuutional matter. On the implications of this additional judgment for the question of al- truistic corporate attention to liability rules, see note 200 iJfra. See a/so note 116 supra; note 1 78 i,tna. 174. See text accompanying notes 128-59 supra. 175. See, e.g., text accompanying notes 210-20 info. 176. In the case of a civil liability rule, these classes are presumably those who could be plaintiffs under the rule. In the case of criminal liability, the question is a bit more difficult, but it is essentially familiar from the long line of cases on implied private rights of action. See, e.g., Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975); J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426 (1964).</page><page sequence="52">52 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 islative judgment not only that it is useful for the corporation to take consideration (a) explicitly into account in some way,'77 but also that considerations (b) and (c) are adequately conveyed to the corpora- tion by market signals and can be omitted as separate factors in any calculus of desirable conduct. In an area untouched by legal rules, the corporate social responsibility proponents would have to give management some other kind of guidance as to which categories of external social costs and benefits should go into the estimated to- tal. 78 2. Altruistic adherence to liabiliy ru/es tn general. Despite these two forms of assistance that a liability rule gives to a management that wants to practice corporate social responsibility, I do not believe that any general notion of altruistic adherence to lia- bility rules gives management the kind of clear guidance we are seek- ing`79 as to how it should behave substantively in particular cases. First of all, where the liability rule is unenforceable because of nondetection of violations, it seems probable that management will be ill-equipped to estimate external social costs at all-even though the legislature may have helped by narrowing the classes of bystand- ers whose costs should be included. Typically, it is difficult for a cor- poration to know how many people are likely to be damaged how much by, for example, its undetected pollution. Undetected conduct tends not to generate any experience about even the nominal amount of liability it should be deemed to entail under, for example, a civil 177. See text accompanying notes 172-74 supra. 178. See text accompanying notes 210-20 bfira. Similarly, even in an area governed by specific legal rules, if the proponents wished to argue for explicit management consideration of external costs and benefits to persons not tied to the contemplated conduct by the relevant rules (such as competitor Y2, and the purchasers and their friends, in my text example), then the proponents would have to justify inclusion of these additional factors in (and perhaps the exclusion of still other factors from) management's cost-benefit calculus on some basis other than the content of the legal rules themselves. Again, if the proponents wished to argue for voluntary corporate adherence to the distri- butional mandate of a liability rule, when the corporation decided to go ahead with some particular activity even after considering external costs, see notes 116, 173 supra, it is the rule that would identify the persons who should be recipients of the voluntary distribution. See note 200 infta. In the absence of a rule, or the absence of a proposed distributee from the class of persons protected by that rule, the proponents' distributional argument would become difficult to make about any significant class of cases. See notes 200, 252 and texts accompany- ing notes 244, 252 in.fra. 179. See texts accompanying notes 79-80, 109 supra. Again, the idea of voluntary law- obedience by an individual need not involve such a search for clear signals of social desirabil- ity. See note 66 and text accompanying notes 59-65 supra. See also text accompanying notes 150-55 supra.</page><page sequence="53">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 53 damage rule. 80 This lack of information does not eliminate all possi- bility of well-directed altruism by the undetected, polluting corpora- tion. But, at least in the first instance,'8' the only altruistic act that seems likely to be called for with reasonable clarity is to disclose the undetected pollution; and again,'82 because such altruistic disclosure is very different from substantive adherence to the dictates of rules of law, I will postpone discussion of it to Part VIII. Where, on the other hand, unenforceability is a result of expenses related to litigation,'33 it seems a shade more likely to be accompa- nied by some management information about external social costs. Nevertheless, the information will not typically be good enough to constitute a clear signal'84 of the socially desired substantive conduct. For one thing, it is unlikely even in this situation that data on exter- nal social costs will be at all precise; any such precision owes to some- thing more than the presence of a liability rule.185 But even more 180. Admittedly, cases may arise in which the corporation's information is sornewha/ better than this analysis has supposed-for example, a case of high employee incidence of cancer at a given plant. But if in any such case the corporation's information about damage inflicted is really good enough to allow choice of substantive corporate actions on the basis of minimizing social costs, then: (1) what distinguishes such a case is not merely the presence of a liability rule, see text accompanying notes 172-78 supra, but rather precisely the extraordi- nary endowment of knowledge on the part of the corporation; and, as I am about to discuss in text in another connection, (2) the liability rule will not itself tell management how it should use its precise information. See text accompanying notes 186-91 unfra. On the question whether such guidance is available to management from sources outside the liability rule, see text accompanying notes 210-70 bnfra. See a/so note 185 unfra. 181. See note 139 and text accompanying notes 136-40 supra; note 264 infra and accom- panying text. 182. See text accompanying note 140 supra. 183. Where a liability rule is enforceable in court, but (some) corporate employees are not (and perhaps cannot be) given sufficient incentive to consider that fact in making opera- ting decisions-that is, where the rule is unenforceable within the corporation although en- forceable against the firm as an entity-the problem is not one of corporate social responsibility at all, as I have defined the area. See texts accompanying notes 21-29, 33-35 supra. 184. See note 179 supra. 185. See note 180 supra. Again, this is so even though the presence of a rule may at least narrow the class of bystanders whose costs should be considered. See text accompanying notes 176-78 supra. Doubts about the quality of the data that management is likely to have on external social costs are reinforced by the necessity in the corporate context, particularly, that these costs be rather precisely quantifiable. In the typical case, management needs a dollar figure to bal- ance against what it would cost to achieve a certain level of compliance by lower-echelon employees. See text accompanying notes 150-51 supra. On the other hand, however impre- cise management's knowledge, there is one special group of cases in which I can imagine an argument that the mere presence of a liability rule, partially unenforceable for reasons of remedial failure, represents legislative approval of a specific form of corporate altruism. I have in mind cases of what I would call "inherent" remedial failure, unrelated to expense of</page><page sequence="54">54 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 generally, while a liability rule may well represent a legislative judg- ment that some kind of interpersonal utility comparisons by manage- ment are appropriate in a given substantive area, 186 as soon as conviction (or for that matter detection) becomes less than certain it cannot just be assumed that a straight dollar-for-dollar cost-benefit comparison is what the legislature would have had in mind.'87 That is, where nondetection or nonprosecution is possible, the legislature's failure to raise the ostensible penalty above, for example, actual dam- ages may represent a judgment that the prospective corporate actor should weigh each dollar of its own potential benefit more heavily than each dollar of the bystander's cost.'88 And so again, if a social consensus does call for straight dollar-for-dollar comparison in a given class of cases, it will take more than the presence of a liability rule to demonstrate this.'89 In short, whether in the case of nondetection or that of non- prosecution, if management's data about external social costs are good, and if it is clear what kznd of interpersonal utility comparison a social consensus would ask management to make with those data, then all this would seem to be for reasons largely apart from the mere presence of a liability rule. In fact, it will turn out that the major category in which it seems plausible that nondetection or non- prosecution of liability rule violations might call for substantive al- truistic corporate adherence to the rule, is no different from the most persuasive category of cases for corporate altruism in the absence of any legislative rule.'90 Hence, this category of cases will be discussed in Part VII.'9' litigation. These might include, for example, inherent shortcomings of the incentive structure under either a negligence or a strict liability rule, see R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 138-41; S. Shavell, Strict Liability vs. Negligence (Feb. 1979) (unpublished paper), and questions of the muting of incentives when insurance is available, see generall4 S. Shavell, Accidents, Liability, and Insurance (Harvard Institute of Economic Research Discussion Paper No. 685, Feb. 1979).

The argument I have pursued in this section is particularly de- pendent on the artificial assumptions I have chosen to adopt for the whole essay.'92 On those assumptions, however, it is hard to suggest at all generally'93 that, where management can escape a liability rule'94 because of nondetection or nonprosecution, it should guide its substantive conduct by its own estimate of the social costs of viola- tion-even as these costs are in effect categorically defined by the substantive rule itself.'95 Nondetection or even nonprosecution'9" may well call in the first instance for altruistic dzsclosure. And though cases may arise in which nonprosecution, in particular, calls for sub- stantive altruism, they will not be cases defined by the substantive rule itself. Rather, they will be similar to cases calling for substantive altruism in the absence of any liability rule. For all the (presumably carefully considered'97) legislative judgments that go into adoption of any liability rule,'98 and that would seem to help in any management endeavor to determine substantive corporate conduct by estimating social costs,'99 the fact is that the presence of a legal rule in itself does not-on the assumptions adopted in this essay-in any general way endorse such a management endeavor.200 192. See genera/4y text accompanying notes 7-9 supra. For example, and certainly with- out limitation, the treatment of altruistic disclosure as a very special category, see note 190 and text accompanying notes 181-82 supra, turns on the assumed legitimacy of the legislative process. 193. See note 185 supra (inherent remedial failures). 194. I am speaking now of any liability rule, whether civil or criminal, and whether flat- amount or variable with damage caused. See note 169 supra. 195. See text accompanying notes 176-78 supra. 196. See note 190 supra. 197. See generally text accompanying notes 7-9 supra. 198. I have in mind, for example, the judgments that: (1) interpersonal utility compari- sons by private actors are in some form appropriate in a given substantive area; and (2) certain categories of costs and benefits can be omitted from explicit consideration in such a comparison in a given area. See text accompanying notes 172-78 supra. 199. See note 185 and texts accompanying notes 179, 186 supra. 200. The proponents may also argue that the presence of a rule-at least if the rule provides for private damage actions-suggests the appropriateness of a slightly different form of corporate altruism. It may be suggested that corporations should, under such a rule, volun- tarily pay persons within the protection of the rule should the corporations go ahead with conduct burdened by the rule. See notes 116, 173 &amp; 178 supra. The amount paid would be whatever sums the rule purports to say are due the protected persons, e.g., actual damages caused or flat-amount penalties. Such a case could arise only if the sum voluntarily paid to injured bystanders would be less than the benefit otherwise experienced by the corporation. If the sum to be paid would exceed the benefit, then the corporation would prefer altruistic abstention from the contem- plated conduct. Thus, any corporation contemplating practice of the form of altruism here in</page><page sequence="56">56 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 C. Lzmited Shareholder Liability As Insulaton from Any Type of Penal The case against asking corporations voluntarily to behave as if the shareholders' personal assets stood behind all corporate civil or criminal liabilities, whether flat-amount or variable, does not rest pri- marily on the inadequacies of management's information.20' Rather, question has presumably already considered and rejected voluntary abstention. (I shall ig- nore the complexities added if the after-the-fact voluntary compensation might be paid only to some of those injured, or to each for only part of the injury caused.) Moreover, the pure distributional argument cannot be made at all if the impediment to recovery by injured par- ties is neither nondetection nor nonprosecution, but rather the rule of limited liability. See generally text accompanying notes 201-07 tnfra. For if the damage caused exceeds the corpo- ration's resources, it cannot compensate the victims voluntarily any more than it could do so under compulsion. (As a practical matter, it does not seem worth inquiring whether manage- ment should ask its disappointed shareholders in such a case to send in contributions to be used for compensating outside victims of the disastrous corporate conduct.) Where the impediment to plaintiff recovery is nondetection, the pure distributional ar- gument seems to me particularly vulnerable to the objection that management will ordinarily not have enough information to practice the suggested form of altruism. See text accompany- ing notes 179-82 supra. For in the case of the distributional argument, although the presence of a rule again at least defines the class of potential distributees of corporate largesse, see note 178 and text accompanying note 179 supra, management would need to know not only how much damage it had caused but also exactly who had suffered it. See text accompanying note 180 supra. At minimum, this means that management would have to publicize its offensive conduct to gather information (this would likely happen in any event as injured bystanders were paid ofl). Since management cannot reasonably be asked to invite lawsuits against the corporation, cases for this kind of corporate voluntarism thus could probably arise only when additional remedial failures beyond nondetection would be expected to bar judicial relief even after disclosure. More to the point, in order to practice this form of voluntarism without defending voluminous litigation, management would have to go into a-surely expensive- claims-evaluation business. The voluntary expenditure of corporate funds on such adminis- trative transaction costs does not seem to be sanctioned by the existence of a legal rule on the substantive questions of the case. Finally, if a case did arise in which management had sub- stantially better information than I have so far supposed, there would remain the question whether the legislature had really sanctioned voluntary full compensation of the victims (i:e., compensation at the putative statutory level), or whether legislative awareness of the possibil- ity of nondetection might suggest the contrary. See a/so text accompanying notes 186-89 supra. Despite this last question, the rare case of fairly precise management information in this context, see text accompanying note 180 supra, might conceivably present a reasonable argument for purely after-the-fact distributional altruism. The situation seems quite similar when the impediment to plaintiff recovery is non- prosecution-except that cases of good management information may be a bit more frequent. See text accompanying notes 183-85 supra. Thus, plausible cases for purely distributional altruism may be a bit more frequent in this situation. Finally, on the possibility that such a pure distributional argument can be made even without reference to a legal liability rule-a possibility that I do not believe encompasses a very significant class of cases-see notes 252, 253 zn/fa. 201. Indeed, where the rule of limited liability is the only obstacle to visiting on the shareholders the full social costs of corporate conduct, it seems more likely that management will be able to estimate social costs than would be the case where valid lawsuits or criminal prosecutions against even the corporation itself were barred-whether by remedial failures, or by the undetectability of the relevant corporate conduct. While undetected conduct will not</page><page sequence="57">November 1979] CORPORA TE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 57 the fundamental difficulty with asking a corporation altruistically to disregard the limited liability doctrine in establishing its level of ef- fort against rule violation,202 is that the doctrine itself is not a mere remedial failure. The doctrine represents a substantive legislative policy-however wise or unwise. And therefore it cannot be said that the presence on the books of some substantive liability rule in itself sanctions an altruistic management decision to act as if the share- holders might have to pay judgments under that substantive rule in excess of corporate assets. If the legislature felt this strongly about the particular substantive rule, it could simply provide for consistent piercing of the corporate veil in cases arising thereunder.203 Again, this is not to say that no case could arise in which a con- sensus social goal would call with reasonable clarity for manage- ment's planning of its conduct as if shareholder liability were unlimited. For example, it might be argued that a management that is considering taking even a very small risk of destroying the ozone layer should attempt to weigh the expected social costs and benefits of that action without regard to limited shareholder liability. And, again, this argument might even be facilitated by the existence of substantive liability rules that would be triggered by destruction of the ozone layer.204 On examination, it may turn out that most such arguments are less likely to justify our asking corporations to make altruistic decisions about substantive conduct (e.g., whether to manu- facture aerosol cans) than to justify our asking them altruistically to disclose all such problems to the legislature or to the society at large.205 But the point for now is that, wherever they may end, argu- ments along these lines must proceed despzie the total mix of signals that the legislature has given to the corporation. The fact that one or another liability rule might call for theoretically infinite liability for destruction of the ozone layer is not, a priori, any more clearly an expression of public consensus about appropriate corporate behavior than is the rule of limited liability itself. The perception of a public consensus that, for example, the ozone layer should be preserved at all costs, must therefore rest fundamentally not on the legislature's generate a track record on amounts of liability, and while conduct not actionable because of remedial failures is likely not to generate such a record, detected and (practically) actionable conduct may well produce relevant quantitative experience-up to and including a final law- suit that bankrupts the firm and produces an unsatisfied judgment. 202.

Conclusion Experience in particular fields of corporate activity-and experi- ence under section 13(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act208 may generate an awareness of whole classes of cases in which voluntary corporate substantive law-obedience at some level is much more clearly desirable than my abstract formulation of the issues has sug- gested.209 But under the assumptions I have chosen to adopt for this essay, it is surprisingly difficult to construct a general case that sub- stantive corporate voluntarism, at fairly precisely defined levels, is called for with any clarity by the presence of a legal liability rule. And it seems particularly difficult to argue that any such case is strong enough to justify significant governance reforms of public cor- porations-such as the mandatory introduction of public interest di- rectors. 206. See text accompanying notes 210-70 rnfra. 207. In the case of employee injuries, workmen's compensation statutes may cut off en- forceable liability long before corporate assets are exhausted. Other such examples also read- ily come to mind. Corporate social responsibility proponents might argue that a corporation should voluntarily disregard this particular limit on liability in selecting its level and tech- nique of production. See a/so note 200 supra. This argument is similar to the suggestion that corporations should disregard the protection of limited shareholder liability in planning their conduct. As with the latter suggestion, the argument for disregarding the workmen's com- pensation liability limit may well run up against legislative policy in imposing that limit. Moreover, it is not clear that the typical public corporation would need to be altruistic at all in order to take into account, in making production plans, expected and detectable damage to workers above the workmen's compensation liability limit. Rather, it may well be that the union contract negotiation process would operate as a market mechanism compelling such a corporation to take this damage into account.

The Kew Gardens Prznciple Can management ever tell without clear legislative guidance that a particular, altruistic corporate act is reasonably clearly called for by a consensus social goal?2"0 I think no one would claim we have any very satisfactory ways-whether by philosophical inquiry or so- cial scientific research-of ever saying with certainty that "Society wants this done, even though the legislature hasn't gotten around to it.""'' As I mentioned earlier,212 we may well all agree on at least the following proposition: It is always socially desirable that the lot of person A be improved (by his or her own lights) if this can be done without negatively affecting anyone else's lot (by his or her own lights). But when the subject is the desirability of corporate altruism, this narrow proposition carries us nowhere. Absent a relevant con- sumption component on the part of the giver,2 3 the distinctive trait of altruism is that the giver's lot is depreciated-by his or her own voluntary act.214 However great these difficulties, the search for clear, extralegisla- tive signals of desirable corporate altruism is so central to the propo- nents' case that it seems appropriate for us to explore at least one moderately promising route they might travel in that search. If we are largely unpersuaded by the strongest case we can construct that such extralegislative signals are available, and if the proponents themselves do not offer us a persuasive case along these lines,215 then the scope of any argument for corporate social responsibility will 210. As we have seen, if our concern is substantive altruism and not voluntary disclo- sure, the question posed in text is essentially dispositive of our issue regardless of whether the legislature has purported to speak in an area. See text accompanying notes 113-209 supra. That is, the presence of a legal liability rule, while exerting an influence over the analysis, see text accompanying notes 169-78 supra, does not generally provide clear guidance for substan- tive voluntarism. 21 1. At least, I think no one would make such a claim, in light of the high standard of certainty about social consensus that should be applied when a corporate management is considering disregard of profit-maximization in pursuit of greater social good. A high stan- dard of certainty is appropriate in this context precisely because of the inability of corporate management, as now structured or as proposed to be restructured, to make decisions on its own about social priorities.

But it does have an intuitive appeal, and I am aware of no stronger case for a consensus social goal (other 216. Specifically, unless we are persuaded by an argument from extralegislative signals, the proponents' case must center on voluntary disclosure and related matters.

Again, I have modified the authors' original statement significantly. This asserted principle is, on its face, somewhat broader than the desirability of Pareto- optimality. 219. As described briefly by Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann, "the public was shocked by the news accounts of the stabbing and agonizingly slow death of Kitty Genovese in the Kew Gardens section of New York City while thirty-eight people watched or heard and did nothing [including telephoning the police]." J. SIMON, C. POWERS &amp; J. GUNNEMANN, supra note 20, at 22. One might question whether this public reaction accurately reflects our views of how people ought to behave. First, one might ask why, if we all subscribe to the principle Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann suggest, the vast majority of our states do not have laws against behavior like that of the Kew Gardens onlookers. However, the absence of such laws does not seem necessarily to undercut the principle: for example, anticipated enforcement difficulties alone might explain the lack of general legislation. One might also well ask whether public reaction to the Genovese case after the fact is a more accurate measure of our social beliefs than the behavior of the witnesses themselves during the event. I have no answer to this question. I simply believe an affirmative response to be sufficiently plausible that the Kew Gardens principle is worth exploring as a possible basis for the proponents' case. 220. Cf J. RAWLS, A THEORY OF JUSTICE 136-42 (1971) (the veil of ignorance). This is not at all the line of reasoning explicitly offered by Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann.

It therefore seems worthwhile to ask how far the suggestion carries us. Two sets of background observations about the suggestion are worth making preliminarily. First, the Kew Gardens principle is broader than the argument, not unheard of in the literature, that it is good for management, however structured, to engage in altruism, be- cause the money so directed is precisely the kind of discretionary as- set221 that would otherwise end up in management's own pocket.222 The corporate social responsibility proponents do not even implicitly rest their case on this better-charity-than-theft notion, and indeed they could not. The argument is questionable in its factual premise, and in any event provides questionable support for mandatory struc- tural reforms such as the introduction of public interest directors.223 (Similarly, theoretical analysis under the Kew Gardens principle in particular, or of corporate social responsibility in general, does not seem much affected by the likelihood that some of what management gives away would come from customer rather than shareholder pock- ets.2'4) Second, if the Kew Gardens principle offers the strongest avail- able case for substantive corporate social responsibility, it follows that traditional charitable contributions225 constitute a particularly questionable form of corporate voluntarism. For none of the factors that specially well suit the corporation to give money to organized charities seems of a kind to signal a social consensus in favor of par- 221. See text accompanying notes 69-74 supra. 222. Discretionary assets may end up in management's pocket in various forms: for example, excess salaries, straight theft, leisure time on the job, and leeway for sloppiness on the job. Corporate charity itself may amount, at least in part, to management consumption and appropriation of corporate assets. See note 65 and text accompanying note 27 supra. 223. There is no reason to believe that corporate altruism will consistently displace rather than be piled on top of excess management remuneration of more direct sorts. Cer- tainly if every public corporation had to have some public interest directors, and if these direc- tors on their own could implement some level of voluntarism, then at least that level of voluntarism might well be additional to direct excess management compensation. See note 74 supra and accompanying text. Moreover, insofar as the proponents' arguments are directed in the end to mandatory structural reform to promote voluntarism, see texts accompanying notes 11-14, 37-42 supra, it seems peculiar to combat rnanagement theft by, for example, putting public interest directors on the board to give away the store. Absent an independent justification for corporate altruism, surely mandatory structural reforms could be more pre- cisely directed at limiting excess management compensation. 224. See text accompanying notes 72-73 supra. It nevertheless seems odd that most of the commentators never pause to wonder whether this point might make some difference. But see R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 311-13. 225. See note 45 and text accompanying notes 45-46 supra. I am, of course, concerned with such contributions only insofar as they are genuinely altruistic, and not directed at long term corporate self-interest.

Moreover, while it somewhat undercuts the general assump- tions of this essay229 to dismiss any legislative provision as a mis- take-even a provision contained within the morass of the Internal Revenue Code-the corporate charitable deduction does not in itself give management any guidance how much to give or to whom.230 If there is a consensus on these questions, it must be discovered from sources outside the Tax Code-presumably from comparative ad- vantages of corporate giving that exist independently of any tax de- duction. A possible advantage of this kind is sometimes said to be the greater willingness of each stockholder to "give"-pro rata through the opportunity foregone of greater dividends-if he or she knows the gift will be matched (pro rata) by all other stockholders in at least the 226. Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann themselves premise their Kew Gardens principle partly on the far greater moral and social force of "negative injunctions" (to avoid imposing harms) than of "affirmative duties."

The opponents tend, not without reason, to see this shortcoming of tax structure as a further indictment of corporate double-taxation in general. See, e.g., M. FRIEDMAN, supra note 87, at 135. But even among the proponents, one encounters the view that corporate funds available for charitable giving either should be paid out in dividends so that sharehold- ers can choose their own charities (or other uses for the money), or should be taxed away by the government so that the political process can select the appropriate donees. See C. STONE, supra note 5, at 111 n.*. See generally note 66 supra. What is more, any argument that the statutory limitation of deductibility to 5% of corporate taxable income, see note 46 supra, reflects a consensus in support of corporate giving at that level, is further undercut by Con- gress's tolerating the provision's failure to stimulate corporate charity in anything like the suggested amount.

In fact, arguments in favor of traditional corporate philanthropy that are ostensibly grounded in principles of comparative advantage frequently seem to rest more on an a priori belief in the need for more charitable donations.234 Such an approach not only abandons any attempt to proceed from neutral principles,235 but also fails to give weight to the frequently voiced fear that corporate domination of philanthropy will mean corporate domination of the recipient charities.236 It is not surprising that, among the participants in the corporate social responsibility debate at a general level, the propo- nents are not far behind the opponents in their reservations about traditional charitable gifts in particular.237 231.

In the exploration of the Kew Gardens principle that follows, we will not find it helpful to characterize a particular altruistic act as directed toward (a) "efficiency," or (b) "redistri- bution," or (c) goals that are in some sense "noneconomic." It is in the nature of all corporate voluntarism to redistribute power over goods and services. See text accompanying notes 88-90 supra. While the social justification for various redistributions may be of differing kinds, it will generally be more useful to explore these variations in a somewhat particularized fashion than to categorize them as matters of "efficiency," "fairness," or "noneconomic goals." Whenever A's lot can be improved at a cost to B that is vastly less than the gain to A- that is, whenever the Kew Gardens principle is implicated-and when there is therefore a consensus that B should act to A's benefit, it would seem to follow that someone would (much more than) compensate B for his charity if there were no special obstacles to such compensa- tion. These obstacles may be legislative ignorance, see text accompanying notes 259-69 znfa; transaction costs in enforcing liability rules or bargaining about property rules, see text ac- companying notes 241-58 znfra; the impecuniousness of prospective beneficiaries; transaction costs in distributing government largesse, see notes 244, 252 and text accompanying note 244 rnfta; or some combination of these obstacles.

Reasonzng from the Kew Gardens Princzple. Remedial Dicullies and Legzslative Ignorance On the assumptions I have adopted for purposes of this essay,238 the value of the Kew Gardens principle to my analysis seems to de- pend in any given case on what explanation can be offered by the corporate social responsibility proponents for legislative failure to force or encourage an action called for by the principle. The two most likely explanations available to the proponents are: (1) that corporate conduct, which happens to escape the net of all existing general liability rules, is not known to the legislature or has not been known to the legislature very long-either because it escapes detec- tion, 239 or because it represents a newly proposed course of action by the corporation;240 and (2) that remedial failures which would be costly to eliminate have prevented the legislature from taking effec- tive action in the area. These remedial failures may include case-by- case failures of detection ,241 the difficulty experienced by many small neighbors would band together if they could, and pay the corporation to stop polluting), and in other cases might be imagined as necessarily coming from the public treasury (i.e., the legislature would pay me to save the life of a beggar on a winter's night). But this difference does not affect application of the Kew Gardens principle, and the distinction between effi- ciency and redistribution seems without much point for our present purpose. But see note 252 l#fra. Similarly, I think it adds little to the analysis to characterize the goal served by a given piece of corporate altruism as "noneconomic." There may be goals the preservation of the ozone layer, some minimum level of human dignity to which we refuse to attach a "price." From the corporate actor's point of view, this might mean that these goals should be fur- thered at whatever cost to the corporation, and even though the corporation will not be compensated for its cost. But, again from the corporate actor's point of view, the problem is to know with reasonable certainty when such a goal exists and is being offended by profit- maximizing conduct-precisely the same problem that the corporation would have in the case of a goal to which we simply attached a "very high" value. The suggestion of "noneconomic goals" seems neither to throw a new light on my variant of the Kew Gardens approach, nor to suggest an independent argument for particular instances of corporate vol- untarism.

Remedial dzfccultzes. Remedial difficulties are not often likely, in themselves, to suggest a potential altruistic act with sufficiently vast disparity between costs and benefits to trigger the Kew Gardens principle. At least, such difficulties are not likely to trigger the principle except when the other potential explanation for legislative failure-legislative igno- rance-is also in point. Moreover, even in the occasional case where remedial difficulties alone may explain a legislative failure so severe as to trigger the Kew Gardens principle, the form of corporate altru- ism most likely to be called for is, once again, disclosure rather than substantive voluntarism. Each of these observations requires some development. If the legislature's information is good, it should almost always be able to design remedies sufficiently effective that the altruistic acts for which room remains will not be certain to contribute vasly more than they cost-the requirement of my version of the Kew Gardens principle.245 The pollution case is illustrative. Given sufficient infor- mation about the damage done by each unit of each pollutant in each location at each moment, there is no reason in theory that the legislature (or its delegatee) could not design a pollution tax (or pol- lution rights auction) system that would largely overcome the trans- action cost problem of private enforcement of environmental goals.246 More generally, penalties could be directed against individ- uals within the corporation as well as against the firm itself;247 penal- ties could be triggered by management failure to exercise sufficient 242.

Usually, when a result of private conduct so appalls us, the legislature can force or encourage private conduct that is at least considerably less appalling.252 And rare cases make a weak argument for wholesale reform of corporate governance structure.253 Moreover, even in the occasional case where remedial problems alone might explain so severe a legislative failure as to trigger the 248. See text accompanying notes 151-55 supra; S. 1437, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. ? 403(c) (1977) (misdemeanor of "reckless failure to supervise" may be dropped from revised bill, see note 155 supra). 249. See note 244 and texts accompanying notes 201-07, 244 supra. 250. See text accompanying notes 33-36 supra. 251. The legislature would be particularly willing to assign stiff penalties in any area where our goals are "noneconomic"-of such importance that we would refuse even to put a price on them. See note 237 supra. And if drastic penalties were not enough to discourage a particular piece of terrible conduct, presumably it would not be realistic to expect altruistic abstention from such conduct by corporations. 252. This conclusion is not undercut by the real possibility that goals of efficiency and those of equity will conflict in designing legal remedies. To be sure, a given wealth redistribu- tion may be expensive or cumbersome to effect through government channels. See Polinsky, supra note 214, at 1676-80; text accompanying note 244 supra. And it follows that the rules and remedies of private law may have to be designed partly with an eye to the distribution that they will produce-since if this distribtion is not satisfactory, it may be too expensive to correct it. See Calabresi &amp; Melamed, supra note 126, at 1098-101, 1110, 1114-15; Polinsky, supra note 214, at 1676-80. But the fact is that private law is designed partly with an eye to distributional considerations; and it is significantly supplemented by government redistribu- tional programs. If the legislature is really appalled in some situation-if there is a vast dis- parity between potential costs and benefits of a reform or a transfer, so as to trigger the Kew Gardens principle-then the legislature almost surely has not done all it could with the weap- ons at its disposal to reconcile the demands of equity with those of efficiency. See generall note 253 u/fra. See also note 200 supra. 253. See note 14 and texts accompanying notes 11-14, 37-44 supra. Most of the cases that come to mind in which a piece of substantive corporate voluntarism might seem called for by the Kew Gardens principle, involvepecu/zar situations-e.g., an employee with a partic- ular emotional sensitivity-that the law cannot be expected to deal with by general rules. And it is in the nature of such unusual situations that, unless they portend social catastrophe, we cannot design general governance structures-including corporate governance struc- tures-to take account of them.</page><page sequence="67">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 67 Kew Gardens principle, the most likely single reason for this would be that (a) detection difficulties would render the remedial system inadequate except at very high levels of penalty, and (b) considera- tions outside the extreme economic model of the criminal law would make it impracticable to raise penalties to the necessary height.254 And again, in any such case, at least analytically and in the first in- stance, 255 the corporate altruism called for would seem to be in the form of disclosure rather than of substantive voluntarism;256 it is therefore part of a topic on which, again,257 I postpone discussion until Part VIII. In short, where the legislature has good information, it is to be expected that the law will give the corporation self-interested reasons not to behave so outlandishly as to violate the Kew Gardens princi- ple. Particular instances of substantive corporate voluntarism are unlikely then to be required or justified by the principle-however precise may be management's own information on social costs.258 2. Legzslatve zgnorance. The search for extralegislative consensus social goals, not reflected in the profit-maximization proxy, whose substantive dictates are clear in particular corporate situations, must focus then on cases where: (1) the Kew Gardens principle is in point; and (2) the expla- nation for legislative failure is legislative ignorance or too-recent learning of the corporate conduct at issue. While many such cases should be covered by general liability rules, it is quite plausible that a given case might not be. For example, the posing of material danger to the ozone layer might violate the Kew Gardens principle in almost all circumstances. Yet a legislature that did not know of such a dan- ger might not have in place any general liability rule adequate to cover the case, if only because of the problem of limited liability. A general rather than a particular rule might be the best way to handle the problem even after one became aware of its specifics. For exam- ple, some form of piercing of the corporate veil and strict liability might be appropriate for all acts causing damage in fact to the ozone layer.259 But if the legislature had not been aware of some danger to 254.

But if the corporation is aware that it is doing or is about do something that may offend the Kew Gardens principle and that the legislature does not know about, then, absent severe time pressures, it would not seem necessary for the corporation to go to the extreme (in analytical terms) of voluntarily abstaining from the conduct in ques- tion (e.g., abstaining from posing even an infinitesimal threat to the ozone layer). It would suffice to tell the legislature or relevant agency about the problem26 -and we are back to the question of disclosure to be discussed in Part VIII. Of course, again,262 the corporation might prefer to engage in some substantive voluntarism, rather than to risk the full effectuation of social consensus that the legislature would seek after disclosure.263 And in fact, this kind of halfhearted corporate response might even be socially justified-if disclosure it- self would carry unjustifiably large social costs.264 But since the case for voluntarism in this situation is again in the first instance onefor disclosure, and since any theoretical case here for substantive volun- tarism rests on the social costs of disclosure, postponement of our analysis remains appropriate. In short, in order for the suggested Kew Gardens principle to jus- tify corporate altruism other than disclosure (at least in the first in- stance), the argument must be (a) that the substantive problem is a new one, and (b) that the Kew Gardens principle will be offended by profit-maximizing corporate conduct before the legislature will have a chance to act. Such a temporary social emergency might arise, for example, in a pollution emergency of unanticipated severity, in which the pollution tax levels set by the legislature or agency were 260.

I have in mind here a corporate management persuaded by the Kew Gardens principle to practice some kind of altruism, but selecting what may be the less costly to the firm of two alternative altruistic acts-substantive absten- tion as opposed to disclosure. The case is therefore distinguishable, at least in theory, from a situation in which a purely profit-oriented management abstains from substantive conduct just because of long term (individual or collusive industry-wide) self-interest in not arousing a legislative response.

But if it did not, substantive corporate voluntarism would seem appropriate. If-on the assumptions of this essay and even if one accepts the Kew Gardens principle-the case of the temporary social emergency is the only one of desirable substantive corporate voluntarism,266 then the question becomes whether this case can justify mandatory changes of corporate governance structure so as to increase the likeli- hood of altruistic response. While I do not propose to try to answer this question,267 my manner of posing it suggests a leaning toward a negative view. Even beyond all the usual costs so often discussed in connection with a public interest director (or other similar) system,268 one wonders whether a system designed exclusively for rare and dis- crete emergencies would not have rusted by the time such an emer- gency arose. The case of temporary social crisis can add to an argument for public interest directors based primarily on other grounds. But if that argument is to carry the day, it would need to be grounded on week-to-week public interest work.269 Yet we have just seen that, even if we reason from the Kew Gar- 265. See L. Goldman, supra note 120. Mr. Goldman's paper is a rigorous and helpful attempt to apply to the pollution area this essay's general approach to corporate social re- sponsibility. His conclusions are not identical with those of this essay. But among the things that particularly appeal to Mr. Goldman about "temporary or seasonal" pollution situations as cases for corporate voluntarism, is that the unlikelihood of timely legislative or administra- tive response makes irrelevant the danger-otherwise of concern in the pollution area-that substantive corporate voluntarism may mislead the agency as to the effects of its own actions. 266. One type of corporate social responsibility we have not so far mentioned that has been frequently demanded over the years-particularly in inflationary times-is the volun- tary restraint of prices to less than profit-maximizing levels. Even apart from a great deal of political rhetoric and misuse of the word "voluntary," the vocabulary of these demands has included references to "fair pricing," see Katz, supra note 26, at 79-81, and to pricing and production "[a]s if the firm were a pure competitor with no monopoly or oligopoly power whatever, either in the short run or (especially) in the long run." Brofenbrenner, supra note 20, at 169 (emphasis in original). Of course, here as elsewhere, see text accompanying note 69 supra, the demands are of questionable coherence absent elements of monopoly or oligopoly. See, e.g., Katz, supra note 26, at 79-80. But even where the firm has some discretion over pricing and production levels, the opponents make out a mostly persuasive case that "socially responsible" price restraint will lead primarily to resource misallocation. See, e.g., M. FRIED- MAN, supra note 87, at 134-35; Katz, supra note 26, at 80-81; Rostow, supra note 20, at 64-68. 267. See text accompanying notes 11-14 supra. 268.

The proponents' case-and in particular their case for mandatory structural changes to promote corporate altru- ism must turn to forms of voluntarism that are not fundamentally substantive. VIII. LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION AFTER THE FACT The case for voluntary corporate consideration of civil or crimi- nal liabilities271 that might never be imposed because of nondetec- tion, nonprosecution, or the rule of limited liability, was a case that the legislature implicitly endorses certain kinds of corporate voluntarism before the fact. I have argued that legislative endorse- ment before the fact provides little support for acts of corporate vol- untarism. However, a considerably stronger argument-although still by no means a clearly persuasive one-can be made that certain other kinds of altruistic corporate acts are inherently sanctioned by the legislature after the corporation performs them. Indeed, this ar- gument, with all its weaknesses, may provide the strongest case avail- able to the proponents of corporate social responsibility-although they have not employed it in this form.272 In particular, this argument would attempt to justify corporate altruism of either of two kinds: (1) voluntary disclosure, by someone within the corporation, to the legislature, relevant agencies, or the public, of harms being done or possibly about to be done by the cor- poration, even where such disclosure is against the corporation's 270. See also notes 139, 264 supra and accompanying texts. 271. See text accompanying notes 113-209 supra. 272. However, some of the proponents have perceived one of the end points of this argument-that voluntary corporate disclosure is a particularly appealing case for corporate social responsibility. This perception is particularly apparent in Professor Stone's work. See text accompanying notes 379-423 nfrta. More generally, a number of those who have written about corporate social responsibil- ity have made suggestions not unlike those I am about to pursue-that the strongest cases for corporate voluntarism concern either disclosure or the nature of the corporation's participa- tion in the political process and related matters-although they have reached these sugges- tions in rather different ways than my own. See, e.g., Baumol, supra note 20, at 55-56; Chirelstein, supra note 10, at 64-67; Malkiel &amp; Quandt, supra note 77, at 47; McKean, supra note 20, at 131-33; Rothenberg, supra note 20, at 211-12, 215 (pollution issue in particular).

This suggestion of a focus is in fact the main point of this part of the essay. The issues that surround disclosure and corporate political participa- tion, even in our particular context, are too complicated for me to do anything more than engage in some initial speculations about their merits. But in the interest of making some small contribution to what I believe should be the center of the corporate social responsi- bility debate, most of this part of the essay will comprise some specu- lations on these subjects. The arguments for corporate altruistic disclosure and for forbear- ance from political participation would be quite similar to one an- other-although the argument for forbearance from "interference" with lawmaking is probably the more difficult. Consider, first, the question of voluntary disclosure. It is credible that the legislature may have failed effectively to compel desirable disclosure by corpora- tions. Insofar as precisely drafted data requirements are in at least some circumstances more productive of disclosure than would be sole reliance on generally worded rules,275 it is the very nature of the areas in which corporate social responsibility proponents want more disclo- sure276 that the legislature may not have the kind of information it needs, when it needs it, to draft effectively. Beyond this, most viola- tions of disclosure requirements will probably never bear fruit in a serious substantive harm, and so-to a greater degree even than with other types of legal violations-a very small percentage of illegal nondisclosures is likely to be detected and punished. While in theory the level of punishment for each detected offense could nevertheless be raised high enough so that any socially desired pace of corporate disclosure could be achieved,277 the general limits on compensating 273. The harms or prospective harms disclosed might or might not constitute violations of law. See texts accompanying notes 308, 318 znfra. 274. See general'y note 288 in/a.

The legislature may hesitate to expend on nonsubstantive offenses some of our limited resource of stiff fines and sentences;279 and, whatever the legislature may decide, prosecutors and juries may refuse to hit white collar offenders with stiff sentences for nondisclosure on top of other stiff sentences for the substantive offense that likely brought the nondisclosure to light.280 In short, any alleged legislative failure to import into the profit-max- imization proxy sufficient incentives to spur socially desirable disclo- sure might be rather persuasively explained. Moreover, however unclear it might be before the fact what effect a particular, voluntary corporate disclosure would have, it could be argued that once the disclosure had been made and the legislature had the information, any legislative action or inaction on the basis of the information would, on the assumptions of this essay, reflect a so- cial consensus as to how the substantive problem at issue should be handled. Management's initial altruism in disclosing would thereby be indirectly ratified.28' The ultimate substantive result in the par- ticular case-a result triggered by the relevant action or inaction by the legislature-would apparently have broad public approval, and so the initial corporate disclosure would end up reasonably clearly serving a consensus social goal.282 While the argument for voluntary corporate forbearance from "interference" with lawmaking would run more or less parallel to this, it has a bootstrap quality283 that the disclosure argument avoids. 278. See note 141 supra and accompanying text. 279. See C. STONE, supra note 5, at 103-05; text accompanying note 251 supra. Further- more, because so low a percentage of nondisclosure offenses is likely to be detected and these would have to be punished so severely, the problem of cx post fairness, see note 141 supra, might operate here as a particularly acute limit on the imposition of effective sanctions. 280. See genera/ly note 141 supra. Still less is it realistic to expect imposition of a stiff sentence should the nondisclosure somehow come to light without any substantive harm hav- ing ensued. Indeed, the only case where stiff sentences for nondisclosure seem a realistic possi- bility is one where substantive harm has ensued and been detected but cannot itself be characterized as any kind of legal offense. 281. I am assuming here that the legislature, deterred by considerations such as those outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph of text, has not passed a relevant disclosure requirement. If such a requirement is on the books and the asserted need for voluntagy corpo- rate disclosure arises rather from perceived inadequacy in the penalty level prescribed by the legislature for nondisclosure, then the proponents might also try to justify voluntary disclo- sure as an instance of voluntary compliance with unenforceable legal norms.

The suggestion that corporations have too much power might well itself explain why the legislature does not strip corporations of such power. The suggestion therefore carries its own refutation of the argument (or the assumption) that, if society wanted it, the legislature would have done it.285 Moreover, if the suggestion means that a legitimate political process would be one with sharply reduced corporate participation, then a corporation which will be affected by a given piece of proposed legislation, and which voluntarily limits its participation in legislative consideration of the legislation, can point to the substantive legislative results as presumptively legitimate. As in the case of altruistic disclosure, man- agement's initial act of altruism is arguably ratified after the fact.286 The ultimate substantive result reached by the legislature apparently has broad public approval, and so the initial corporate abstinence ends up reasonably clearly serving a consensus social goal.287 What is more, in the hands of proponents of even moderate ambition, this argument might be directed to justifying corporate "political absti- nence" far broader than forbearance from lobbying on a particular bill.288 284. See text accompanying note 7 supra. See also note 288 i-fra. 285. But see text accompanying note 290 sufra. See also note 288 infra. 286. Again, if management abstains from political participation because it is not clear that the (always uncertain) results of such participation will be worth the out-of-pocket costs, or for fear of a backlash should the firm's political hand be overplayed, or for any number of other perceived profit-maximizing reasons, then the abstinence is outside the bounds of corpo- rate social responsibility as we have defined it. See text accompanying note 30 supra. 287. But see text accompanying note 290 nftia. See also note 288 infra. 288. It is a vast oversimplification to think of corporate political participation as consist- ing of the lobbying for or against particular pieces of legislation. Seegenerally First Nat'l Bank v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978). Even in the political arena proper, the corporate role has always gone far beyond this, see generally E. EPSTEIN, THE CORPORATION IN AMERICAN POLITICS (1969), and indeed has taken on new dimensions in recent years. See S.F.

One group of difficulties bears almost exclusively on the political absti- nence case; the other bears most directly on disclosure issues, and will be discussed in that context here, although it carries some implica- tions for the political abstinence argument as well. A. Problems with the Polti'cal Absttznence Argument The most obvious problem with the political abstinence argu- ment is its bootstrap quality. The argument must assume that cur- rent corporate participation is excessive. Further, the argument gives the corporation no good extralegal signal as to how much it should participate in politics. Admittedly, the absence of such a signal is not much of an argument for profit-maximizing corporate political par- ticipation to the limits allowed by (enforceable) laws; much of the point of the proponents' political-abstinence case would be that these laws in particular289 are questionable reflections of a consensus view. Nevertheless, the proponents' political-abstinence argument would have to suggest that the excesses of corporate political participa- tion-more than other forms of arguably offensive corporate con- duct-are better evaluated by, for example, public interest directors case by case, than by the legislature or by an agency in making a general rule.29 propose to ask generally whether the pervasive influence of all corporations (or of other pow- erful institutions) in society undercuts the legitimacy of our political process. See text accom- panying note 7 supra. And indeed, it could well be argued that my restrictive assumptions also exclude a more specific argument by the proponents, along the lines of the one I have just outlined in text, but purporting to demonstrate that it would be desirable for individual corporations altruistically to restrict their general political and social influence. See text ac- companying note 290 infra. (Indeed, my assumptions might exclude as well the narrower argument in text on lobbying, see text accompanying note 290 znfa-and perhaps also any argument for voluntary disclosure as well, see text accompanying notes 334-36 n/fra.) But in any event, it is not necessary now to explore at length any proponents' argument for voluntary restriction of general corporate influence. Any such argument would encounter not only all the difficulties I am about to discuss in text in connection with the narrower type of question represented by lobbying, but further difficulties as well, because of its sheer breadth of subject matter. In accordance with my general approach of examining the proponents' best case, the abstention argument in text will therefore be explored only in its narrowest domain-as it bears on lobbying or otherwise influencing particular political decisions-where we shall see that it encounters problems enough.

See generally text accompanying notes 113-209 supra.</page><page sequence="75">November 1979] CORPORA TE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 75 Such an argument is not inconceivable if one grants the underly- ing premise of excessive corporate political activity in general. Per- haps, while corporate participation in the political process is not so excessive as to undercut our assumption of legitimacy generally,291 the one area where the process cannot be trusted is in regulating the participation itself. Perhaps corporate lobbyists are uniquely sensi- tive-and, the argument would run, uniquely overzealous-in pro- tecting their own political rights against legislative incursion. Perhaps public interest directors therefore could regulate corporate political participation, in particular, "better" than the legislature. This of course raises the question of how legislation imposing public interest directors-expressly to limit corporate political participation from within would itself ever be passed. More fundamentally, even if corporations might be particular(y overzealous in lobbying against restrictions on their own political activity, the argument's initial as- sumption of legislative illegitimacy seems to be in some tension with the general assumption of legislative legitimacy on which this essay is built.292 But conceivably the political tactic of limiting corporate po- litical participation from inside rather than externally might be the more likely to succeed; and conceivably a real distinction of degree can be made that the legitimacy of corporation-in-politics laws is more questionable than that of other rules affecting corporations. I suggest only that these questions-as well as the underlying as- sumption that corporate political participation in general is currently excessive-should be among the initial foci of any corporate social responsibility debate.293 B. Problems Bearing Most Directly on the Voluntary Dziclosure Argument The suggested argument for some level of voluntary corporate disclosure also hides a number of severe difficulties.294 In particular, my presentation of the argument ignored the questions: (1) how much it would cost the corporation to collect the data to be disclosed; (2) whether systematic collection and dissemination of such data on a much broader or more intense basis than practiced today might have adverse side-effects within the corporation; and (3) whether public disclosure might lead to responses by other interest groups, outside 291.

Out-of-pocket collection costs. It cannot be argued that consensus social goals are necessarily served by a corporation's voluntarily295 spending money to gather data, with a view toward disclosure, on problems associated with its operations. Even if the ultimate decision to disclose might be viewed as legitimated by whatever action the legislature did or did not take in response to the disclosed information,296 the corporation's decision to spend its resources altruistically on data-gathering would not be sanctioned by the legislature's response. However, there are almost surely broad classes of cases, involving matters of major social impact and intense legislative interest, in which the out-of-pocket costs of a corporation's collecting at least some information will be de minimis.297 The debate about the desirability of corporate govern- ance reforms intended to spur altruistic corporate disclosure should probably focus, at least initially, on the prevalence and nature of the cases in which out-of-pocket information-gathering costs are triv- ial.298 A proponent might attempt to argue further that the introduc- tion of public interest directors is necessary and desirable precisely so as to spur substantial data-collection expenses with an eye to altruis- tic disclosure. The argument would be that, since the legislature can- not know ahead of time how important it will be to get some kind of 295. See notes 35, 273 supra. 296. See text accompanying notes 281-82 supra. But see note 316 and texts accompany- ing notes 316, 334-35 znfra. 297. Much information is surely already in top management's hands, or readily avail- able to it. Moreover, if altruistic disclosure is socially desirable and can come-or can come cheaply-only from lower levels, the proponents will be ready with schemes intended to in- fuse those lower levels, as well as the board, with the spirit to disclose voluntarily. See, e.g., C. STONE, supra note 5, at 213-16. Seegenera/Il zi. at 184-98.

Even in such cases, there may be a nontrivial cost of potentially drowning the recipient in information. See note 326 znhfa and accompanying text. However, in the case of altruistic disclosure to the government, see notes 334-36 znfra, this does not seem an immedi- ate danger.

And this conclusion together with other general difficulties of the suggested proponents' disclosure ar- gument that I am about to discuss, and with the difficulties of the political-abstention argument discussed earlier302 suggests that the proponents similarly should not emphasize at the outset the case for a kind of hybrid voluntarism that includes both disclosure and politi- cal action: the frequently voiced notion that corporations individu- ally or cooperatively303 should, at least under some circumstances, lobby affirmatively and altruistically for restrictive legislation or reg- ulation.304 Again, if corporate governance structure should be re- formed to spur altruistic disclosure and related activity, the proponents are most likely to make this case, at least initially, where the out-of-pocket costs of the altruistic act would be trivial. 2. Adverse efect on zntracorporate incentives. Even when out-of-pocket costs are likely to be trivial, voluntary corporate disclosure of information almost surely tends to deter, to at least some degree, upward flow of future information within the firm.305 Particularly if the disclosed information was gathered from intermediate levels, this effect may inhibit the future percolation of information even while it is still far from top management. And again, though the mere decision to disclose may be ratified by legisla- tive action or inaction, the decision to incur the costs imposed by the deterrent effect is not legitimated by the legislature. 299.

A highly relevant question for discus- sion in the corporate social responsibility debate which in general, in ways far beyond the scope of this essay, must concern itself in- tensely with intracorporate information flows306 -is the extent to which the danger of such deterrence should make us hesitate to try to encourage altruistic corporate disclosures.307 And if we did have, for example, public interest directors in public corporations to spur al- truistic disclosures, they (and the whole board) would have to con- sider in any proposed case of voluntary disclosure whether the worth of the information to the legislature would be likely to exceed the cost to the corporation and society from the deterrent effect engen- dered by disclosure.

As portions of Professor Coffee's ambitious piece make clear, all the organizational questions that bear on or are affected by problems of in- trafirm information flows-problems familiar from their labels of "subgoal pursuit "span of control," and so forth would be of prime concern in structuring corporate governance to achieve any particular set of goals. See, e.g., id. at 1131-47. Where the goal is some practice of altruism in general (not one of Professor Coffee's concerns), or of altruistic disclosure in par- ticular, these problems might well be so severe that the game would not be worth the candle. See note 307 infra. But I choose to exclude any detailed exploration of this territory from the scope of this essay, since it can be viewed as encompassing primarily questions of the means available for getting corporations to do whatever society selects as their proper job. See note 43 and text accompanying notes 37-44 supra. 307. For example, the danger of deterring information flows might be a persuasive ar- gument against introducing or systematically encouraging "whistle-blowers" within the firm. See, e.g., Coffee, supra note 36, at 1146 &amp; n.176. Seegenerally notes 43, 306 supra. It might be argued that so long as any disclosure represented a discretionary decision by someone of authority within the corporation particularly the board of directors it could have less deterrent effect than would compulsory publication. Although Professor Coffee is not primarily concerned with voluntarism in general or with voluntary disclosure in particu- lar, see, eg., Coffee, supra note 36, at 1115; note 36 supra, he makes a somezwha/ analagous suggestion. See Coffee, supra note 36, at 1181-82. Finally, as debate focuses on deterrence of future information flows by current disclo- sure-or on information-flow questions more generally, see note 306 supra it will inevitably become embroiled in the specialized questions of professionals' roles, and especially lawyers' roles, in corporate disclosure (and related conflict-of-interest problems).

Qua/i'y of external response. In discussing this final question, it is useful to start with a theoret- ical distinction between disclosure to the legislature or agency and disclosure to the public at large. Admittedly, the distinction has little ring of reality on first statement material disclosed to the govern- ment may quickly become public.313 I would nevertheless like to in- dulge for a moment in the assumption that disclosures to the legislature and to the public can be distinguished from one another (zie., that confidentiality is a realistic possibility in significant classes of cases). I do not think that it can be argued generally that consensus so- cial goals are necessarily served by voluntary public-extralegisla- tive-disclosures of problems with corporate operations.314 For reasons I am about to explore, the substantive results of extralegisla- tive reaction to one corporation's disclosure will not presumptively 308.

While, in accordance with the assumptions I have followed throughout this paper, it could be said that any such publication by a legitimated government body is presumptively in the service of a consensus social goal, this particular artifice of my argument seems strained beyond usefulness in the context of publicity decisions. 314. The belief that more public disclosure can only improve the precision with which externial pressures move the corporation toward socially desired conduct, see note 36 supra (discussing Professor Schwartz); seegenerally Coffee, supra note 36, at 1277-78, amounts almost to a variant of the "managerialist" suggestion that, in the long enough run, profit-maximiza- tion and astute "balancing" of constituency interests are exactly the same thing. See note 93 supra.</page><page sequence="80">80 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 legitimate the initial disclosure decision.3"5 Indeed, complexities of the kind I am about to discuss that arise in connection with volun- tary public disclosure by a given corporation, may substantially weaken any argument that, if the legislature itself takes no action in response to the information, such inaction is a ratifying substantive result. Rather, the substantive result may in some sense be "skewed" by the additional element of one corporation's voluntary disclosure beyond legislative channels.316 And it also seems difficult to argue that public interest directors, for example, could evaluate on a case- by-case basis the weight to be given the problems of public disclosure that I propose now merely to sketch.317 These problems are not so much ones of possible retrospective liability from public disclosure a possibility largely taken care of, even should the disclosed matters touch on past criminal acts, if ge- neric disclosure is available318 as the dangers of some kinds of "bad" prospective responses by interest groups outside the legislative process. For example, while in the case of "plant-specific" informa- tion (say, about the incidence of cancer319), it might seem to make sense for a corporation to disclose to its labor union320 rather than to 315. See note 333 infra (question whether, on other hand, secrecy of deliberations would undercut legislative legitimacy). 316. Compare text accompanying notes 322-23 nfira wi/h text accompanying notes 334-36 infra. What I have in mind is that the problems of legislative action that arise in any case where one corporation voluntarily discloses, see text accompanying notes 334-36 1nfra, even if not severe enough in themselves to undercut my general assumption of legislative legitimacy, might be severe enough to make us question legislative ability to correct any inap- propriate (first-instance) extralegislative response to the disclosure. But I obviously must ad- mit considerable tension between this suggestion and my general assumption of legitimacy. See text accompanying notes 291-92 supra; text accompanying note 335 infra. 317. Compare texts accompanying notes 290-93, 300 &amp; 311 supra. 318. See sources cited notes 308, 309 supra; text accompanying notes 308-09 supra. While the proponents might go on to argue the desirability of having criminal or privately actionable acts (voluntarily) disclosed with specificity what Professor Coffee (rather dispar- agingly) calls "confessional disclosure," see, e.g., Coffee, supra note 36, at 1255-56-this is best analyzed as part of the question of altruistic obedience to legal rules. See note 200 supra. Again, while more specific disclosure may be required whether or not the requirement is always enforceable under the federal securities laws, the only question of corporate social responsibility thus raised would be one of voluntary compliance with (partly) unenforceable legal norms. See notes 281, 300 supra. 319. Even apart from the problem of workmen's compensation laws, see note 207 supra, general liability rules may well not apply to situations where plaintiffs entire proof consists of a slightly higher incidence than normal, in groups affected by behavior (like that) of defend- ant, of a particular disease or condition. See R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 152, 276. This might, therefore, seem a particularly attractive area for some corporate voluntarism. 320. The work forces of the public corporations on which this essay is focused, see text accompanying note 75 supra, are of course in large proportion unionized. The problem of how much information the union should ideally receive obviously cannot be solved by the</page><page sequence="81">November 1979] CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 81 the government, the substantive result of such disclosure in the first instance321 would be an indeterminate question, the answer to which would depend, for example, on relative union/management bargain- ing skills. There is no a priori reason to believe that this result will be superior, in any sense that has consensus social support, to that achieved absent disclosure; and indeed, if the information may also be specifically relevant to a number of competitors' plants, but if they are unlikely to practice similar voluntary disclosure,322 then it seems plausible that nondisclosure by all may be socially desirable as a second-best result.323 Similarly, while disclosure to consumers of everything the com- pany knows about its products, or to the securities markets of every- thing it knows about its financial status, might seem, intuitively, all to the social good324 (assuming again that data-gathering is a trivial expense), here dissemination itself is expensive,325 and there is, possi- bly, the danger of drowning the recipient in information.326 More- over, as in the case of labor union disclosure, it is not clear in the consumer case, for example, that society would prefer voluntary dis- closure by one offending firm while others remain silent, to a (per- haps partly self-cancelling) silence by all offenders.327 And finally, expedient of giving the corporation a property right in the information and letting the union bargain for it: You cannot shop for what you do not know. 321. See note 316 supra. 322. See note 327 znfra. 323. On the possibility that this problem also infects the argument for voluntary disclo- sure to the government, see text accompanying notes 334-36 zfra. Again, questions of voluntarism by corporate consortia-for example, an industry band- ing together to tell the union about all the health problems specific to each company's plant-are beyond the scope of this essay. See notes 78, 303 supra. I also omit from mention in text a number of further difficulties with disclosure to the union, beyond the game-theory and second-best questions just raised: for example, problems of trade secrets, and of "tailoring" the disclosed information precisely enough so that the union is told only what it need know. Cf. note 336 rn/fa (possibility of similar problems with voluntary disclosure to the government). 324. See Arrow, supra note 20, at 307-09 (consumers). The role of a well-informed se- curities market in the efficient functioning of the economy is a familiar enough theme to require no comment here; no less familiar by now, however, is the notion that allocative efficiency does not require that everyone with a dollar to invest receive every piece of informa- tion applicable to every available investment in the country or the world. See note 326 infra and accompanying text. 325. Cf. note 298 supra (disclosure to government). The dissemination problem in con- sumer markets is aggravated by the tendency of different consumers to want different infor- mation emphasized. 326. See, eg., TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 448 (1976) (Marshall, J.) (proxy rules); cf. note 298 supra (disclosure to government). 327. See A.

But the "auto- matic" legitimating effect, that arguably might make disclosure so appealing a case to us for corporate voluntarism, does not apply at least topublz/c confessions.33' Even if it can be assumed that some pub- lic disclosure would be desirable, the social merits of each confession would necessarily be a matter for the unguided discretion of, for ex- ample, the public interest directors and the rest of the board. And the board's task in evaluating the desirability of each voluntary pub- lic disclosure would be complicated by the presence of generalized and immeasurable costs from deterring future information flow customers, so that corrective mechanisms can have time to operate in situation of monopolis- tic or imperfect competition). See a/so note 316 supra. 328. This is standard practice, however, in the securities markets. See A. HIRSCHMAN, supra note 327, at 26-27 (arguing, in effect, that the desire to sell its own product may among other things deter a firm even from disclosing what is bad about competitors' products); R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 274. 329. See genera/ly R. POSNER, supra note 69, at 81-82. 330. A related question is whether full disclosure of corporate altruism itself-whether voluntary or otherwise-would automatically raise the firm's cost of capital in the securities markets. See note 52 supra. (Under current federal securities law, if ever there were a firm that did not choose to boast of its "altruism," disclosure presumably would be required when the dollar amounts involved were material or the expenditures were not business-related.) The effect of disclosure on the cost of capital does not seem altogether clear, even on the assumption that investors who themselves favor corporate altruism are relatively rare. See note 25 supra. At any given level of current profitability, the answer would seem to turn on whether a purely profit-oriented investor would take the altruism as (1) a sign that more bad things can be expected from this management in the future, or as (2) an opportunity for profitability to increase as soon as this management gets the message that (or gets ousted because) shareholders oppose voluntarism. See A. HIRSCHMAN, supra note 327, at 14 (value of "slack" more generally); R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp; J.

Thus, it seems more profitable for the cor- porate social responsibility debate to focus at least initially on dis- closure to the legislature or properly constituted administrative agencies. This conclusion puts all the pressure on the assumption with which we started: that systems exist, or can be devised, for corpora- tions to disclose operational problems to the government in the se- cure belief that the information will not become public-absent a deliberate government decision that publication is in the public in- terest. (Such a deliberate decision to publish might, or might not, come in connection with a substantive government response to the disclosed information.) I suggest that our ability to turn this assump- tion into a fairly general reality-and a reality recognizable, when it exists, by an altruistically inclined management-should be (on the general assumptions of this essay) one of the foci of the corporate social responsibility debate. If the strongest case for public interest directors, for example, may be that they will make voluntary disclo- sures, and if that case is most persuasive with regard to disclosures to government, then it becomes essential to decide whether there is a significant class of cases that can even sensibly be termed "disclosure to the government."333 Moreover, even if such a class of cases exists, the speculations we just engaged in about public disclosure force us-now that our issue is at last clearly joined-to reconsider the assumption of this essay that fully informed government action carries an automatic social legitimacy.334 Again, I do not mean to suggest that the corporate social responsibility debate is utterly incoherent as separate from a general discussion of political theory (although it is certainly not easy to separate it).335 But even if one comes at the matter solely through the issue of corporate social responsibility, one cannot help but raise 332. See text accompanying notes 305-12 supra. 333. If such a class of cases does exist, then, under the terms of the argument we have been exploring, at least the initial secrecy of legislative (or administrative) deliberations need not undermine their political legitimacy. It might be argued, for example, that: (1) if the government takes no action on the information, any weaknesses in the justification we have been exploring for altruistic corporate disclosure become inconsequential, both for the corpo- ration and for the society; and (2) if action is taken (even just by deliberate publication in a proper case, but see text accompanying note 314 supra), it will be public at that time and subject to reversal by the full political process. But see note 316 supra. Among the other difficulties of this argument, of course, is its considerably oversimplified taxonomy of possible legislative responses to a disclosure. 334.

Summarn In short, among the appropriate initial concentrations of the de- bate about corporate social responsibility-and, in particular, of the debate about compulsory reform of corporate governance institutions to engender more corporate voluntarism-seem to me to be the fol- lowing questions, raised by the speculations in which I have just in- dulged:337 Is it desirable to reduce the role of public corporations in the po- litical process to at least some degree?338 Is it realistic to think this might be done by mandatory reforms of corporate governance struc- ture, even when legislation apparently cannot be passed to do it through external sanctions? Is there some sense in which, for exam- ple, public interest directors might be "better" equipped than the legislature to evaluate in specific those aspects of corporate conduct that constitute political participation? In light of the potential availability of generic disclosure, might we trust, for example, public interest directors to spot and weigh, on a case-by-case basis, the danger that voluntary corporate disclosures might inhibit future information flows? Is it realistic to think that, in broad classes of cases, either government agencies or the legislature would and could keep voluntarily disclosed corporate information confidential unless they had reached a deliberate decision that publi- cation was in the public interest? Could a corporate management, presumably restructured to be more altruistic, spot in advance the cases where material disclosed to an agency or the legislature would 336.

Similarly, questions arise whether the disclosed information-particularly if not matched by the firm's competitors-can be "tailored" to the legislature's needs, see note 323 supra; whether it might include trade secrets, see id.; and at some point even whether the government itself might start drowning in voluntarily disclosed information, see note 298 supra. 337.

Could an altruisti- cally minded corporate management, contemplating particular pos- sible altruistic disclosures, score fairly well at answering this last question in advance for each case?340 If the answers to questions like those above seem to defeat a case for mandatory restructuring to spur voluntary disclosures, might our response to this nevertheless be to force corporate restructuring-with the specific purpose of encourag- ing primarily substantive voluntarism in cases where something like the Kew Gardens principle34' may be violated because of legislative ignorance;342 do we want to trust, say, public interest directors with the responsibilities that this suggests they ought to have? How much is added to the case for mandatory restructuring by the argument that corporations should at least be so altruistic as to refrain from affirmative misrepresentations? IX. AN AFTERWORD: THE NADER AND STONE PROPOSALS This completes my suggestion of an approach to the corporate social responsibility topic. In order to highlight what I believe to be the value of defining that topic clearly, and of considering certain questions within it before others, I will close the essay by summariz- ing and criticizing parts of two widely publicized proponents' books-Taming the Giant Corporation343 and Where the Law Ends.344 I believe each of these books to be confused at a most fundamental level. In particular, both books illustrate the consequences of jump- ing into proposals of means to engender corporate social responsibil- ity345 before addressing the question of what type of responsibility is desirable.

These would range, for example, from (1) prohibitions of "specific types of [corporate] pre-employment testing and on-the-job surveil- lance, such as the use of mandatory polygraph tests and the gather- ing of confidential credit information [on employees or prospective employees]";347 (2) a bar to "any federally chartered firm . . . ac- quiring any firm among the largest eight firms in any industry where four or fewer firms control 50 percent or more of the market";348 and (3) a presumptive (at least) divestiture requirement when "four or fewer corporations account for 50 percent or more of the sales in any important line of commerce in any section of the country in any con- secutive two-year period within the most recent five years";349 to (4) a variety of strict director, officer, and other employee conflict-of-inter- est prohibitions concerning interested transactions, multiple employ- ment, and other corporate opportunity problems, etc.;350 and (5) detailed requirements with respect to the structure and method of selection of the board of directors.351 These and other substantive limitations and requirements would be given bite by a variety of new or strengthened enforcement techniques and sanctions.352 The most important of these substantive proposals for our pur- poses is that concerning the structure and method of selection of the board.

All cam- paign costs would be borne by the corporation.360 This set of proposals contains at least two levels of confusion-or at a minimum, insensitivity-concerning the distinction between cor- porate altruism and profit-oriented corporate response to external pressures. First, as has been widely noted, many of the Nader group's substantive proposals are difficult to view as anything other than "new Federal regulatory requirements in the fields of labor. con- until . . .

Moreover, all this "democratization" of the process of board selection would be supplemented by augmenting the shareholders' direct rights in corporate governance: More information would be disclosed to them; they would have the right of approval of all "fundamental transactions"; and so forth.

Some of the possible explanations do not rise to any exalted philosophical level: For example, the group may have preferred to avoid the separate consideration of each substantive element of its package by the relevant Senate and House 366 i committees. But it seems to me more instructive to try to under- stand the group's own explanation for its grab-bag use of the pro- posed charter: [T]he problem of unaccountable corporate power is far larger than any narrow [external rule and] remedy. To contain that power re- quires a systemic, integrated approach like federal chartering. By systemic we mean a reform that confronts causes and not effects, that addresses the fundamental issues of the legitimacy and accountability of corporations in a constitutional democracy. By integrated, we mean that the various solutions to corporate abuse are in fact interrelated . . . . For example . .

A comprehensive Federal Chartering Act would depend on the "internal" checks of corporate democracy and the "external" checks of disclosure, competition, and constituency remedies to safeguard against corporate abuses. The omission of any prop weaken[s] the entire structure.367 If all this means anything, it seems to express a perception on the part of the Nader group that, once an external rule is part of the corporate charter and not just part of the United States Code or the Code of Federal Regulations, it somehow becomes more than an ex- ternal rule. In some metaphysical way, the rule becomes not only a limitation on the behavior of the corporation (the corporation's "ef- fects"), but also a part of the corporation's own motivation (the "causes of corporate behavior). The very purpose of the corpora- tion, its sense of ultimate goals, is somehow ennobled. At minimum, this gives the rule itself a self-enforcing quality. But beyond that, the internalization of the rule in the charter becomes part of some much broader process of "systemically" and "fundamentally" changing the corporation from an abusive to a socially desirable creature.368 Tam- rng the Gzant Corporation seems to propose modifying many of the external rules that affect corporations not just to change what corpo- rations do, but in some sense to change what corporations want and what they are. Yet the book's argument for each proposed modifica- tion of the external rules is never clearly made in these terms; and indeed, as the entire thrust of this essay should make plain, such ar- guments would be difficult to make. The grab-bag nature of the pro- posed federal charter therefore seems to reflect the most pervasive and perhaps disingenuous kind of confusion of a general effort to 367. R. NADER, M. GREEN &amp; J.

HESSEN, IN DEFENSE OF THE CORPORATION 111 (1979); that Nader's ultimate vision is that of people living in "small, self-sufficient communities where 'they can grow their own gardens, they can listen to the birds, . . .

Whether or not it is true that Nader thus sees each of the reforms he has proposed over the years as a step toward changing the nature of man, it does seem likely that each of the substantive proposals in Taming the Giant Corporation is included not only for its perceived particular merits, but also for a general contribution to changing the "fundamental" nature of the corporation.</page><page sequence="90">90 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 32:1 stimulate corporate altruism with particular attempts to modify many of the corporation's profit-oriented responses. Whether or not I am right that the Nader group proposals are confused in this most general way, there is little question that on a second, more particular level, Tamzng the Gzant Corporation is insensi- tive to the distinction between altruism and self-interested response: The proposal of an independent, democratically elected, full-time, fully staffed, 9-constituency board of directors is presented as being a (partial) simultaneous solution to (1) the problem of management insensitivity to legal sanctions and long term profits, and (2) the problem of management monomaniacally seeking profits at whatever cost to broader social concerns.369 The reformed board that Nader proposes is apparently supposed to be both (1) more sensitive to long term profits, and in particular the long term profit implications of new laws or political pressures, than are most current boards,370 and (2) more willing than are most current boards to sacrifice profits to the board's perception of the public interest.37' Indeed, even that half of the proposed duty of each of the several constituency directors that consists of taking "responsibility for representing a particular social concern" is itself a remarkable hybrid: It is perhaps intelligible to ask the partly altruistic "employee welfare" director to "balance" the interests of his or her peculiar constituency "against responsibility for the overall health of the enterprise"; but it is not even intelligible to ask for such a "balancing" from the presumably profit-oriented director who represents "finances," or the one who represents "man- agement efficiency."

Certainly the book's difficulties in exposi- tion have not prevented its readers from perceiving that promotion of corporate altruism, and not shareholder interests, is the primary ob- ject of Nader's proposals on internal corporate governance.373 As it happens, however, Thamzng the Gzant Corporation's pretense of congru- ence between altruism and sensitivity to profits374 distorts, among other things, the Nader group's choice of means to promote corporate voluntarism. As has been much noted,375 the authors never ade- quately explain why shareholders in public corporations-who to date have shown little interest in anything but profits, and for the most part expend little energy on internal corporate affairs to further even that goal-should suddenly start choosing and ousting direc- tors, whatever names we may give those directors, with an eye to the general social good.376 It is understandable that the Nader group might want to clothe itself in the Berle and Means tradition.377 And it would be nice if we lived in a world where, in the long run, self-interest were perfectly congruent with the social interest.378 But there are choices to be made and, at the very least, we should acknowledge this before we set out to reform our institutions. 372.

Where the Law Ends Professor Stone could not be more emphatic in the early parts of his stimulating volume that the purposes of his various proposed mandatory corporate structural reforms go well beyond encouraging corporations to obey the law. The reforms are also intended to cause corporations to act "responsibly" in the same complex moral, ethical, and psychological sense that we employ when we think of responsible behavior by human beings.379 In particular, Stone's initial definition of the kind of corporate "responsibility" he would seek includes such elements as: "reflection" before acting; careful observation of the likely consequences of a given action; appreciation and consideration of one's full freedom to take any one of a range of possible actions; the casting of all these reflections, observations, and choices in "the society's moral vocabulary," while proceeding with "a desire . . . to 'do the right thing' "; and a willingness "to give some justification for what [one] is doing. . . . in terms that admit of generalization."380 A quick tour of Where the Law Ends will suggest that Professor Stone is unable to keep his self-proclaimed purposes long in mind: Despite all the explicit emphasis early in the book (and from time to time later381) on moral and psychological elements of "responsibility" that go far beyond law-obedience, it is astonishingly easy to come away from Where the Law Ends with the impression that the main thrust of mandatory corporate structural reform should be simply to bring substantive legislative edicts home to management.382 The central thesis of Where the Law Ends is that, "[i]nstead of treating the corporation's inner processes as a 'black box,' to be influ- enced only indirectly through threats laid about its environment like traps, we need more straightforward 'intrusions' [by the law] into the corporation's decision structure and processes than society has yet undertaken."383 Whether we want merely accurate corporate re- sponses to external stimuli we will provide, or "voluntary" corporate assaults on major social problems, Stone argues that we will not get 379. See, e.g., C. STONE, supra note 5, at 120 ("Many corporate social problems do not feasibly lend themselves to the traditional legal treatments . . . . In those cases, what seems needed as a 'remedy' is some institutional analogue to the role that responsibility plays in the human being, guiding action toward certain values where the ordinary legislative prohibi- tions are unavailable or, on balance, unwise."); id. at 72-73, 93, 112, 113-16. 380.

The intriguing part of Stone's book-a large portion of the first half-brings together a useful series of obser- vations on the familiar problem of why corporations as now struc- tured do not respond as might be expected to external stimuli and, in particular, to legal sanctions.384 Included in this failure of corporate response is the corporation's failure to restructure its own internal governance processes if the current processes do not produce the most profitable substantive response to each stimulus.385 To pluck a very few examples from Professor Stone's rich harvest of suggested expla- nations, let me just mention these: (1) "[t]o the executive and his business community peer group, having profits cut into by a lawsuit simply does not involve the same loss of face as losses attributable to other causes";386 (2) "[t]here are uncertainties as to when violations will be detected (an especially significant consideration in light of the different time horizons for various individuals and groups within the organization-X trusts that by the time the violation is, if ever, dis- covered, he will have gotten his promotion) 55;387 (3) the difficulty of bringing legal actions against high-ranking corporate executives in particular because, among other obstacles, they are protected from knowledge of much of their corporations' actionable conduct;388 and (4) the familiar themes of shareholders insulated by limited liability, and professional management insulated from even shareholder con- trol.389 When, in the second half of the book, Professor Stone proposes his "intrusive," mandatory reforms of corporate structure so as to pare these buffers to external stimuli, he also repeats the other promise so emphatically made in the first half of Where the Law Ends:390 that the reforms will also cause a corporation to "reflect," to consider all "consequences" and "alternatives," to think in terms of moral cate- gories, and to do "only things it would be prepared to justify pub- 384.

Professor Stone suggests that this protection of high-ranking executives from infor- mation arises from a combination of (a) the generalized and complex nature of their responsi- bilities, (b) the natural tendency of subordinates to suppress bad news, and (c) the increased tendency of subordinates to suppress bad news when its suppression may protect the manag- ers from legal liability.

Rather their content outside the disclosure area, insofar as it is at all clear and precise, seems exclusively directed after all at issues of obedience to law or, at most, of responsiveness to external stimuli more generally. For simplicity, I will confine to one field my illustrations of this discrepancy between promise and performance on Stone's part. I will summarize and criticize only those of his governance proposals that bear on the structure and method of selection of the board of directors. The interested reader will find, however, that for the most part the same criticisms can be directed as well at Stone's proposed reforms of lower levels of the corporate hierarchy.393 Stone begins his discussion of the board of directors by dividing into two "classes" the range of substantive corporate conduct that we may want to influence through board reform. "Class A behavior" comprises corporate actions about which there would be a consen- sus-if the facts were known-as to whether the action would be de- sirable or not; and this consensus would exist both outside and within the corporation.394 Most often Class A behavior seems to involve is- sues where the substantive requirements of the law are relatively un- ambiguous; in any event, it almost invariably involves issues where there is substantial congruence between the corporation's longrun profit interests and society's broader goals. Stone gives the decision whether to market thalidomide as an example of Class A behavior.395 A number of Stone's specific proposals for board reform are ex- plicitly directed at Class A issues: elimination or substantial reduc- tion in number of inside directors in large corporations;396 requirement in such corporations that at least two directors or 10 percent of the directors (whichever is larger) "neither personally own, nor be a director or officer of a firm that owned shares" in the subject 391.

But see id. at 217-27. 394. Id. at 135-37. Although Stone at one point seems to say that Class A behavior, no less than Class B, lies in a "gray area" of no social consensus, see id. at 134, the overwhelming weight of his exposition is to the contrary. 395. See id. at 135-36. 396. This reform is suggested for corporations "above some threshold level of impact- those, say, with annual sales of $50 million or more."

By Stone's very definition of Class A issues, these reforms are not even advertised as redeeming his promise to infuse corporations with a sense of "respon- sibility" beyond profit-maximizing response to external stimuli. Class B conduct, on the other hand, does not attract nearly as broad a consensus of opinion as to its desirability or undesirability- even when all the facts about it are known. In particular, the domi- nant opinion among the public at large about the desirability of such conduct may be at odds with the opinion of a "cross section of busi- nessmen such as are sitting on a typical. . . board . . "..401 Among Stone's examples of Class B issues are those of pollution, and of the removal of a manufacturing plant from a dependent town.402 The part of Stone's proposed board reforms that is ostensibly directed at Class B issues comprises the establishment of "two sorts of public di- rector systems"-what he calls "general public directors" and "spe- cial public directors. "403 According to Stone, "[e]very corporation . . . should have 10 per- cent of its directors general public directors . . . for every billion dol- lars of assets or sales (whichever is higher) "-except that for financial corporations and utilities the asset denominator would be $3 billion rather than $1 billion, and for all corporations there might be a stat- utory ceiling on the percentage of the board that would ever have to consist of general public directors.404 These directors would be nomi- nated by a federal regulatory agency; confirmed by "a majority of the board" of the subject corporation; and removable by unanimous vote of that board without cause, or by two-thirds vote for cause. Absent such removal, general public directors would serve indefi- nitely.405 General public directorships would be at least half-time 397. Id. at 141. 398. Id. at 149-50. 399.

Their powers "would be essentially of the same character as the [general public directors'], but exercis- able within the [special public directors'] narrower range of author- ity"; further powers might also be added in particular situations- including in an extreme enough case "the power to halt produc- tion. "409 The remarkable thing to note is that, having set up these two elaborate pieces of directorial machinery, allegedly to help deal with Class B problems, Stone then proceeds to explain the functions of general and special public directors in terms that give them no clearly defined duty410 beyond ensuring astute corporate response to external stimuli such as the law-except, again, in the very special area of corporate disclosure.411 To be sure, as I have already noted, Stone takes the occasion of defining public directors' functions to re- peat his promise that their introduction will infuse corporations with anthropomorphic senses of "responsibility."'412 But the specific illus- trations he exhibits of what public directors might be expected to accomplish all seem-except in the disclosure area413-instances of improved corporate response to the firm's own long term profit inter- ests, and often to the law in particular: directors of a railroad spot- ting the short-sightedness of letting the roadbed deteriorate;414 directors of any manufacturing firm establishing systems so that test evidence of product defects, "plain bad business" to ignore in the long run, would not be suppressed by subordinates;415 directors 406.

Again, then, Stone fails to redeem his promise that he will make corporations not only more astute, but psychologically and morally "responsible." To the criticism of lack of precision or particularity in the extra- profit mandate of the public directors, I expect that Professor Stone would respond that we must do the best we can. He would rather have thoughtful,4"7 if rather unguided, corporate conduct than mind- less corporate pursuit of ostensibly clear but sometimes socially counterproductive goals.418 And the legitimacy of his thoughtful, public directors would presumably arise from the quasipublic process of their appointment.419 Yet Stone appears to be as uneasy about this-or at least about any assurance of wisdom on the part of the appointing agency-as are a number of his critics:420 It seems most revealing that he shies away from giving examples of hard choices to be made, or at least influenced, by public directors whose most direct constituency is a government agency.42' Again, I certainly do not mean to suggest any lack of content or relevance in the idea that "responsibility" comprises a complex set of moral and psychological approaches to action or decision. I think Stone has accurately identified the heart of what many find objec- tionable in a society organized heavily around the corporation (or around large organizations generally). But for purposes of designing institutional reforms, the idea requires elaboration; at least, if one is proposing a particular reform, one must give some sense-specifically in connection with that reform-of how the idea would be expected to work out in practice. In short, the way in which Professor Stone backslides when the crucial moment comes to give examples of what his public directors might do, seems to me to suggest his own profound uneasiness with the substitution of a "thoughtfulness" standard for that of profit- maximization.422 His book is much better than that of the Nader group; but in the end, he too tries to support a particular proposed reform by pretending it requires less painful choices than it really 416.

CONCLUSION Any mandatory governance reforms intended to spur more cor- porate altruism are almost sure to have general institutional costs within the corporate system itself.424 The question should always be whether the anticipated benefits of reform will exceed these costs. One's answer to this question will, of course, depend significantly on one s political and social beliefs. But the proponents of "more" cor- porate social responsibility have never bothered to analyze or ex- amine, from any clearly defined starting point, even just the benefits they anticipate from reform-with whatever degree of analytic preci- sion or empirical thoroughness the circumstances permit. Although the specifics will turn on one's starting assumptions, I believe that any rational assessment of potential benefits must come out of a study-substantive area by substantive area; type of disclo- sure by type of disclosure; in light of economic theory, political the- ory, and empirical evidence-of the kinds of questions I have suggested as initial foci of the corporate social responsibility de- bate.425 423.
