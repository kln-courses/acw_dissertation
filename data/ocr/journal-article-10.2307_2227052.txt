<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL JUNE 1950 SOME PROBLEMS IN THE PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE I THE present article discusses certain elaborations and applica- tions of the now familiar and widely used presentation of the theory of comparative cost in terms of opportunity cost. It is largely an essay in welfare economics. I shall, however, not discuss the issue of real or labor cost vs. opportunity cost, because it would not serve any useful purpose. For, as Samuelson once said, " the doctrine of opportunity cost, properly stated, in no way contradicts the so-called pain cost theory of value. In fact, when stated with full qualifications, the doctrine of opportunity cost inevitably degenerates into the conditions of general equilibrium." 1 The issue seems to me no longer a live one, and its discussion can therefore be appropriately relegated to a footnote.2 1 " Welfare Economics and International Trade," American Economic Review, Vol. 28, 1938, p. 263. 2 Ten years later Samuelson seems to have forgotten what he had written in 1938. In June 1948 in the ECONoMIc JoimNAL he said: " Professor Viner has steadfastly maintained the more general equilibrium approach of Walras, Pareto and Marshall against his opponents Knight, Haberler and Robbins. And one by one they have either had to maintain an empirically gratuitous position (that all factors must be perfectly inelastic in total supply and indifferent between different uses) or else have had to reformulate the opportunity cost doctrine so that it becomes not only a rather awkward mumbo-jumbo but loses all novelty and distinctiveness as well " (p. 182). It could be easily shown that Bohm-Bawerk himself had already in 1894 (see his article " Der letzte Massstab des Guiterwertes "-1894, Reprinted in Ge.qam. mette Schriften von Bohm-Bawerk, ed. F. X. Weiss, Vienna, 1924, especially pp. 428 et 8eq.) extensively, though perhaps not quite satisfactorily in all details, discussed the simplifying assumptions stated in parenthesis above which Samuel- son chooses to call a " gratuitous position." These assumptions can, therefore, hardly be characterised as subsequent concessions grudgingly made " one by one." Viner himself admits that the opportunity-cost approach (in the narrow, unqualified sense) is superior to the real-cost approach " in the case of land use" where " real costs are absent or unimportant " (Studies, p. 520). He speaks of a " genuine contribution " of the opportunity-cost technique " to the treatment of land-use costs." Surely, what holds of land also holds of other factors to some extent even of labor (ibid., p. 525). He insists that " the opportunity-cost form No. 238-VOL. LX. Q</page><page sequence="2">224 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [JUNE II As is usual in such discussions, I shall use a two-country, two-commodity approach. One country may stand for the rest of the world, and the external terms of trade will be assumed to be given. This does not mean that what will be said applies only to a country of so negligible a size in the world economy that it literally cannot by its action influence its terms of trade. It only means that the country is supposed to act competitively and that the possibilities of monopolistic doctoring of the terms of trade and oligopolistic or bilateralistic complications will not be dis- cussed in the present paper. Dynamic aspects will also be ignored. Let us now start with the familiar diagram (Fig. 1) showing a production opportunity curve AB, which represents the maximum combinations of A and B that can be produced. The curve is drawn under the assumption of constant (inelastic) supply of factors of production and of perfect competition in the factor and product markets.' The curve is drawn concave towards the origin signifying increasing opportunity cost of A in B and of B in A. Assume that in the absence of trade production takes place at point P, output (national income) being Oa of A and Ob of B. The tangent to the curve at P has then a double meaning: Its slope of the income approach has no obvious advantage as compared to an outright income approach " (ibid., p. 520). Now I never regarded the opportunity-cost theory as anything but an " out- right " income approach, in fact nothing but a somewhat simplified general equilibrium approach; and it does not require excessive generosity and tortuous interpretations to see that this is also the attitude of the other (including the original) propounders of the theory. Everybody seems to be agreed, in principle, on which factors have to be taken into consideration as determinants of income or, better, of economic welfare. But not being sufficiently skilful mathematicians, most of us resort to simplifications and allow for factors from which we abstract in our simplified models by means of somewhat vague verbal qualifications. Without pursuing this matter farther, I would still say that the simplifications made in the (unqualified) opportunity-cost approach are empirically much less absurd than those resorted to by any real-cost or pain-cost doctrine; the oppor- tunity-cost approach is more fertile, because it can be readily extended into a general equilibrium system. It is therefore not surprising that the opportunity- cost approach has gained more and more popularity, and that it is used even by those who, in principle, attack it. (See, e.g., Samuelson in the very article from which the passage cited above is taken, and Stolper and Samuelson, " Protection and Real Wages," Review of Economic Statistics, 1941.) 1 The assumption of inelastic factor supply is made for convenience, but is strictly speaking not necessary. How the production-opportunity curve is to be derived from the production functions of the two commodities is shown in W. F. Stolper and P. A. Samuelson, " Protection and Real Wages," Review of Economic Statistics, 1941, reprinted in Readings in the Theory of International Trade, Philadelphia, 1949. Stolper and Samuelson, too, assume inelastic factor supply. If they did not, they would need two additional dimensions, and their box diagrams would not work.</page><page sequence="3">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 225 indicates (1) the exchange ratio between A and B, one unit of A being exchanged for two units of B (this is, of course, the re- ciprocal of the money price ratio and of the ratio of marginal money cost of A and B) and (2) the marginal transformation ratio: for one unit of A that is given up, two units of B can be produced. OUANTITIES OF A A T a p pit ______ Q B OUANTITIES OF B 0 b b' B FIG. 1. It is very important to keep these two meanings apart, for only under special conditions will the two ratios be identical. These conditions are, roughly speaking, competition, indifference of factors with respect to the industry in which they are einployed, and absence of external economies and diseconomies. If any one of these two conditions is not fulfilled, the exchange ratio (price ratio) and transformation ratio will diverge from one another and, as we shall see presently, very important welfare consequences flow from this divergence. Assume now that trade is opened and the international-trade ratio is given by the slope of line P'T. That is to say, abroad one B buys about two As, while at home one B can be exchanged for only half an A. Our country will therefore specialise in B. Commodity A, which is cheap abroad, will be imported, while B, which is cheap at home, will be exported. The production point will travel from P to P', where the marginal transformation ratio is equal to the new exchange ratio, and by trade the country will then move to, say, T, exporting P'C of B in exchange for CT of A. How is the precise location of T on the line TP' determined? For our purposes it will be sufficient to answer: by demand conditions. Some writers prefer to say that the location of T is</page><page sequence="4">226 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [JUNE determined by the point of tangency of the trade line with an indifference curve. It must not be forgotten, however, that a shift in production will usually be accompanied by a redistribution of income. This precludes the uncritical application of community indifference curves, either as an explanatory device (we cannot say " the community " will choose the most preferred point on the trade line, because " the community " does not do any choosing except in a centrally planned economy) or as a criterion of welfare (we cannot simply say any point T on the trade line is " better " than P, on the ground that it obviously lies on a higher indifference curve). Things are not as simple as that. But we shall not pursue this matter any further, and the reader who wishes to think in terms of indifference curves may do so for the purposes of the present paper.' But that point T is " superior," i.e., represents larger " national income " or " economic welfare " than point P, can be established without making use of indifference curves. If T is above and to the right of P, a larger quantity of A and B is available after trade than before, and it is natural to call this a superior position. If T were, as it may well be, above P but to the left of it, say at T', there would be consumed after trade more of A but less of B. In what sense, then, can T' be said to be a " better " position than P ? I reject the anthropomorphic argument to the effect that the society could have chosen T, which is superior to P, and since it actually chose T', this, a fortiori, must be better than P. This argument is unsatisfactory, at least for an individualistically organised economy. In such an economy what is to be regarded as a better position, a larger national income or superior welfare position must be defined in terms of individual incomes or welfare positions. Modern welfare economics has, however, shown that in the following sense the situation after trade can be said to be better than before: if income were appropriately redistributed, every individual could be made better off than before.2 It is not necessary that income will actually be redistributed so that everybody will in fact be better off; there will practically always be some individuals who are worse off than before. But it is 1 T. de Scitovszky, in his article " A Reconsideration of the Theory of Tariffs" (Review of Economic Studies, 1942, reprinted in Readings in the Theory of Inter- national Trade) has made the only serious attempt, as far as I know, at constructing community indifference curves, taking into account changes in the income distri- bution. His solution of the problem is, however, not entirely satisfactory in my opinion. 2 See especially Samuelson's formulation in " The Gains from International Trade " (Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science, 1939, reprinted in Readings in the Theory of International Trade).</page><page sequence="5">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 227 sufficient that everybody could be better off. That is the definition of what is meant by saying that one situation is better and constitutes a larger national income than another.' HII What we have stated above is an ideal case which underlies much of the free-trade reasoning. Everybody knows, of course, that it is an idealised case which is never completely realised in actual practice. There are many types of frictions and deviations from the ideal conditions caused by monopolistic and oligopolistic imperfections of the market, external economies and diseconomies, price and wage rigidities, lack of information, irreversibilities of the various curves involved, etc. Each of these conditions may operate in such a way as to make certain deviations from the free- trade policy rational on purely economic grounds.2 But these imperfections may just as well be such as to strengthen the economic case for free trade. A mere enumeration of possible imperfections and deviations from the ideal case does not prove more than the possibility that certain controls might be beneficial (provided of course that they are efficiently administered-which amounts to assuming quite a lot). On this practically all econo- mists agree. In order to prove that the restriction of international trade (rather than the opposite) is justified, it is necessary to show that these imperfections are persistent (in other words that there is not even a tendency for the ideal situation to work itself out) and that they persistently operate in such a direction as to weaken (rather than to strengthen) the case for free trade.3 I shall now illustrate this by discussing with the aid of our 1 It should be clearly realised that such a statement necessarily implies a value judgment on the part of the scientist, and in that sense is not entirely ob- jective. But it seems to me that the formula in the text expresses clearly what we have in mind, when we say that trade (under certain assumptions) or something else, say technological advance (again under certain assumptions) increases national income and economic welfare. There are, of course, other alternative or supplementary valuations possible: for example, certain value postulates with respect to inequality of income distribution could be introduced. Moreover, it may be questioned whether a situation in which more goods are available for everybody is under all circumstances to be regarded as a better situation. But we need not go into these questions in the present paper. 2 The above list is not meant to be a complete catalogue of cases in which a certain amount of control can be justified. For example, protection for the pur- pose of improving the terms or for changing the income distribution will not be discussed in the present paper. 8 Thomas Balogh does not betray any awareness of the complexity of these issues, and seems to believe that he has proved something by a loose and inexact enumeration of possible deviations from the competitive ideal.

It is often said that perfect mobility of factors within each country is a necessary condition for the ideal classical model. The old classical assumption of international immobility vs. national mobility of labor 1 is undoubtedly responsible for this miscon- ception.2 It can be easily shown, however, that what really causes trouble and may make trade detrimental and justify protection is rigidity of factor prices, which may or may not be associated with immobility of factors. If perfect mobility of factors between industries were required, the theory of comparative cost would indeed be useless. For it is obvious that land and other natural resources as well as man- made factors of production, such as fixed capital, are in fact immobile locally and occupationally. So is labor to a large degree, at least in the short run. In order to bring the basic principles out quite clearly, let us make the extreme assumption that there is no factor mobility whatsoever. (This assumption is, of course, even more unrealistic than the opposite extreme of perfect mobility. In any real economy there is a large amount of mobility, even if labor is occupationally almost entirely immobile, through the possibility of redirecting intermediate goods such as iron and steel and other materials and fuels, certain types of machinery, trans- portation services, etc., from one industry to the other.) Under this highly unrealistic assumption the production opportunity or transformation curve shrinks to the broken line, aPb 3 (Fig. 1). If all factors are in inelastic supply (implying that their prices are perfectly flexible), production will take place at point P. Assume that before trade the exchange ratio between A and B is the same as before, i.e., is given by the slope of the straight line drawn through P. (It is true we cannot now say that it is equal to the marginal rate of transformation, because there is none if there is a kink at P. But we need not discuss here how the exchange rate is determined. If we permit ourselves the use of community indifference curves, we would say that the slope of the I Ohlin makes the same assumption as the early classical writers for his "region." His inter-regional trade is the same as classical international trade, for regions are characterised by internal-factor mobility. See his Interregional and International Trade. 2 See, e.g., Thomas Balogh, op. cit. This paper is a convenient and inexhaust- ible store of fallacies and misconceptions in this field. He says " there must be free internal mobility of factors " (p. 188). 3 It could be objected that in this case there is, by assumption, no trans- formation possible. This is quite true; still it is useful to regard the broken line, aPb, as a degenerate transformation curve.</page><page sequence="7">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 229 indifference curve going through P determines the exchange ratio between A and B.) Now assume foreign trade is opened at the rate shown by the trade line TP'. The production point will stay where it was, but the country will import a certain amount of A in exchange for B and move to, say, T". T" is certainly inferior to T or T', and its superiority over P is not so obvious as that of T. Still it can be shown that with trade the country is better off than without in exactly the same sense as in the case of T': By redistributing income it would be possible to make everybody better off, although in fact the A- producers will be worse off and the B-producers better off than before.' Now let us introduce in addition to immobility of the factors complete rigidity of factor prices. A-producers are, say, organised and their union does not permit any reduction of their members' real wage in the face of falling demand and a lower price of A. In that case, production of A will fall, and some (or all) A- producers will become unemployed. Production will fall to, say, P", and the trading point may be T"', which is clearly inferior to P. Conversely, if by a tariff or some other protective device the 8tatus quo ante is restored, the result is a definite improvement. Protection thus may become highly beneficial.2 A number of questions remain to be answered. First, how is point P" determined? Why is it not higher up or lower down? We may say that the extent to which production will fall depends on the shape of the marginal-cost curve. Production will fall to that point where marginal cost has fallen to the price level at which A is being imported. If the production function is homogeneous and all factor prices are rigid, constant costs will prevail and production of A will cease altogether. We need not, however, make such extreme assumptions. If the production function is not homogeneous or if some factor prices are not rigid (the price of land and of fixed capital equipment are likely to fall, in other 1 The redistribution of income will, naturally, be much more drastic than in the case of mobility of factors. In fact, it may socially be intolerable. On the other hand, it is perhaps worth pointing out that the distributional aspect may be absent: Suppose A and B are in joint supply (although without any possibility of changing their proportion). Then it would be impossible to distinguish between A and B-producers. In terms of indifference curves, it is clear that T' is superior to P. 2 If we make, however, the by no means unreasonable assumption that in the meantime wages of the B-producers have become rigid at the new real wage- level, a tariff will not carry us back from T"' to P. While production of A will expand, production of B will shrink, and we shall arrive at a point to the left and probably below P.</page><page sequence="8">230 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [JUNE words, these factors are likely to be in inelastic demand-barring dynamic complications, e.g., expectations that the price change will not last) or if inefficient workers will be dismissed first or if efficiency all around goes up, as is likely to be the case when unemployment rises-in all these cases marginal cost will fall when output is reduced, and P" will not move all the way down. A second question is whether T"' is niecessarily inferior to P. The answer is no, not necessarily, not even if production of A ceases altogether. Suppose that the international terms of trade are extremely favorable, that is to say, that the trade line is very steep, for example, bT" (not drawn in the diagram). Then it would be possible to reach T" or a still more favorable point beyond T" on the line bT". This is really obvious: If any com- modity can be obtained from abroad almost without cost, it would be better to discontinue production altogether, even though it involves a lot of unemployment.1 What we have proved is the possibility of an unfavorable outcome, not its necessity. This possibility is, naturally, the greater the lower the production point (i.e., the greater unem- ployment) and the less favorable (i.e., the less steep) the trade line. A third question concerns the implied change from the assump- tion of inelastic to that of perfectly elastic factor supply. For absolute rigidity of factor prices is equivalent to perfect elasticity of factor supply, while previously we assumed (for simplicity) inelastic factor supply. Two kinds of supply curves of labor must be carefully distin- guished: (a) The supply curve of the individual worker reflecting his subjective preferences for work (or income) as against leisure, and the market supply obtained by adding all individual supply curves; (b) the market supply curve as determined by union policy (or minimum-wage legislation or some -other collective regulation). I suggest that failure to distinguish between these two meanings of labor supply has confused the discussion about voluntary vs. involuntary unemployment. What is really meant by involuntary unemployment is an excess of supply in sense (a) over actual demand, more people wishing to work at the current 1 Of course, under the extreme assumption made with respect to complete factor immobility, it would be still better to let production of A continue and to import additional amounts. But that would require either flexibility of wage- rates of A-workers or an arrangement by which some of the gains made by B-producers through cheap imports of A can be transferred to the A-producers so as to maintain their real wage.</page><page sequence="9">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 231 wage than can be employed. This is quite compatible with supply in sense (b) being equal to demand.' There would be complications from the point of view of the welfare interpretation, if contrary to our assumption the supply curve in the sense (a), i.e., the subjective, individual supply curve of labor, were not inelastic. Although it is impossibly unrealistic, let us assume that labor supply in that sense is entirely elastic. (Assume, for example, that people have income from other sources and don't care for work below a certain wage- level.) In that case the resulting unemployment would have to be called voluntary. Point T"' need then not be called inferior to P. If namely, economic welfare is then defined not only in terms of products A and B, but also interpreted to make allow- ance for " irksomeness " of labor, the reduction in commodity supply implied by T"' as compared with P would be offset by more leisure.2 IV We have proved for the extreme case of factor immobility and factor-price rigidity that trade may be very detrimental. It should be observed that no adverse multiplier effects depending upon a temporary excess of imports over exports are involved. The balance of payments is in equilibrium all the time. The 1 We may put the distinction in the following way: from the point of view of the preference of the individual workers, that is to say, from the welfare standpoint, unemployment is involuntary; but from the point of view of the union it is volun- tary, because the union voluntarily withholds labor supply at a lower wage. This does, however, not necessarily mean that the unions act against the wish of their members, not even of their unemployed members. I think that our construction is in accord with, in fact gives life to, Prof. T. Haavelmo's forbiddingly abstract scheme: " The Notion of Involuntary Economic Decisions " (Econometrica, Vol. 18, No. 1, January 1950, pp. 1 et seq.). Haavelmo is troubled, as any theorist who values precision and clarity may well be, by the problem of how to interpret and to reconcile with accepted theoretical notions the concept of " involuntary " decisions and " involuntary " unemploy- ment. He reaches the sensible conclusion that " the concept of involuntary decisions is related to the comparison of alternative economic systems, and not to the decisions within a given system " (loc. cit., p. 2). Applied to our case we would have to say, that in a system not characterised by wage rigidities employment would be larger, and the difference in the amount of unemployment between the two systems is " involuntary unemployment." 2 It is a terminological question whether in this case we should distinguish between national income and economic welfare, the former being defined in terms of products only, while the latter makes also allowance for disutility of labor and similar factors. It may be also observed that the case takes on another complexion, if labor supply becomes very elastic (as is likely to be the case) at a very low wage-level. It then would sound rather artificial, if not callous, to say that those workers who do not care for work at a very low wage " don't care " for work and "-prefer leisure." But we cannot pursue this matter at this point.</page><page sequence="10">232 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [JUNE detrimental effect of trade, the failure to reach an optimum, is entirely due to the fact that a static optimum condition is not fulfilled: the equality between the price ratio and the marginal substitution ratio is not preserved.' The exchange ratio (reci- procal of money-price ratio) is given by the slope of P"T"', while the ratio of marginal transformation is given by the slope of Pb (as was explained above, aPb can be regarded as a degenerate transformation curve). Thus, because the price mechanism does not function properly, the price line cuts the transformation curve instead of being tangential to it.2 T A a b B FIa. 2. It will be instructive to apply now the argument to a less extreme case in which only some, not all, factors are immobile and only some factor prices are rigid. In Fig. 2, we compare three cases, T, T' and T. We have two transformation curves. The outer one APB is drawn under the assumption that most factors can be shifted and that the price system functions competitively. It thus portrays the " ideal " case. If P is the situation before trade, the country moves by production from P to p, and from there by trade to T. Now let us start from the same initial position P, but assume that a number of factors are immobile. The reason for the im- 1 This is an optimum condition, because we assumed, for simplicity, the terms of trade as given. If that assumption were dropped we would have to substitute for the international price ratio what might be called the " marginal terms of trade." 2 We may also say the ratio of private marginal cost, which determines, and is equal to, the price ratio (since the commodity markets are assumed to be competitive), does not reflect the social ratio of marginal substitution.</page><page sequence="11">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERRNATIONAL TRADE 233 mobility may be technological or unwillingness to move. Then we get a more sharply curved transformation line, aPb, inside APB. This curve might well be regarded as a short-run curve, inasmuch as in the short run factor mobility is in all probability much less than in the long run. We assume, however, that factor prices are still in inelastic supply, and that competition prevails, all prices including wages being perfectly flexible. This case is then, in principle, no different from the preceding one. The country will move by production from P to p', and from there to T' by trade. T' is inferior to T, but superior to P. The inferiority of T' compared with T is due to the fact that owing to the reduced mobility of factors or, in other words, due to the lower adaptability of production, the output of B cannot be expanded so much as previously when the output of A is reduced. It should be also observed that when the production of A contracts, it is quite likely that certain factors of production will become idle; but only after their prices (imputed value) have fallen to zero. Suppose A is wheat growing, then marginal pieces of land will be abandoned. (On the other hand, in the B industry extra marginal factors may be drawn into employment.) The existence of unused free goods, extra marginal land, machinery, buildings, mineral deposits or even labor does, however, not constitute unemployment, although its emergence may constitute extreme hardship for the owners of the factors which have become worth- less. The hardship is, of course, especially conspicuous in the case of labor, but is not necessarily confined to it. In the case of labor there is the further complication that its supply is surely not inelastic at low wages. Therefore labor will become unemployed long before its price has fallen to zero. But we come to this point presently. The third case is distinguished from the second by the fact that in addition to immobility we assume price rigidity for some factors. We ought, then, to draw a third transformation curve more sharply curved than, and inside, the second one. But for simplicity I use the curve aPb again. It, thus, illustrates two alternative cases. If the price mechanism does not work competitively, if certain factors used in the production of A cannot shift to industry B and refuse to accept a price cut, but choose to become unemployed, the price line will cease to be tangent to the transformation curve. The country will move by production from P to (say) p", and by trade from p" to, say, T'. T" is inferior to P, and trade is therefore detrimental. What</page><page sequence="12">234 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [JUINE was said in the preceding section concerning the precise location of p" and the possibility of T" being superior to P applies also to the present case. Why the two cases (the case of mere immobility and the case of price rigidity) lead to different results can be explained as follows. In the " ideal " case we have the following equilibrium conditions: the money prices of A and of B are equal to their respective marginal cost. Each factor is remunerated according to its marginal productivity, and all factors that are willing and able to move receive the same remuneration in both industries. Now suppose that output of A is reduced by one unit. A marginal cost's worth of factors is thereby set free. But these factors produce the same value in industry B. It follows that the price ratio is equal to the marginal rate of transformation.' No factor released from industry A becomes unemployed unless its price has fallen to zero, i.e., unless its marginal productivity has vanished. Hence the existence or emergence of unutilised extra- marginal factors does not affect the equality of the price and substitution ratio. In the other case where some factor prices are rigid, factors become unemployed before their price has fallen to zero. Hence, when the production of A is curtailed by one unit, the production of B is expanded by less than the corresponding value because some of the factors go into unemployment rather than into employ- ment in B. Therefore, the price ratio is not equal to the marginal rate of transformation. Expressed differently, the ratio of private marginal cost of A and B does not reflect the social ratio of marginal substitution, or, shorter, private and social cost deviate from one another.2 1 This is, of course, true only if, as we assumed, the wage of those factors which can move is the same in both industries. Suppose factors can move-freely, but that there exists a definite wage differential, wage-rates in one industry being, say, 20% higher than in the other; then the price ratio would not be equal to the marginal ratio of substitution. This is true whatever the cause for the existence of the wage differential. The welfare implications are, however, different accord- ing as to whether the wage differential is based: (a) on preferences of the workers (e.g., the one type of work being more disagreeable than the other) or (b) on an arbitrary regulation. (See Viner's critique of Mihail Manoilesco's " The Theory of Protection and International Trade " in Journal of Political Economy, 1932, p. 121, and my Theory of International Trade, p. 197. This case could be analysed with the help of our diagrammatic apparatus. In fact Fig. 3 below could be used without any change to portray this case. 2 In Pigou's ternminology: Private and social marginal net product do not coincide. The reader should remember that we have assumed inelastic supply of labor as far as the individual workers are concerned (as distinguished from the market supply as determined by collective action). This implies that our welfare scheme</page><page sequence="13">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 235 We have established the possibility (though not necessity) of detrimental effects of trade in case of rigid prices and of beneficial effects of protection in the case of unemployment. It should be remembered that unfavorable multiplier reactions are excluded and changes on the income distribution ignored. How important is the case here analysed? Is it a theoretical curiosum or a matter of practical importance ? It is dangerous to jump from such an abstract model to practical application, and there is room in an article not even for a sketch of how to fill the gap. Still I venture to say that, at least in the short run, it is a matter of serious practical concern. However, even in the short run certain qualifications would have to be made, protection would not be more than a pis aller and rational policy should not be concerned entirely with short-term considerations. But we cannot pursue these thoughts any farther at this point. V In this section two other cases will be briefly analysed which give rise to a deviation of price ratio from the marginal rate of transformation. Unemployment is not involved in either case. The first case is the much-discussed case of external economies or diseconomies.1 It is usually thought to be connected with the includes only alternative product cost and ignores other elements, e.g., possible differences in the " irksomeness of labor " in the two lines of employment. In other words, economic welfare (national income) is defined in terms of products A and B only. We could, of course, introduce in addition to that disutility of labor. If the rigidity of factor prices, i.e., elasticity of factor supply, were due to individual preference rather than to collective.regulation, that is to say, if individuals preferred to go idle rather than to work below a certain wage, case 3 (T") would not involve a welfare loss as compared with case 2 (T'), because the loss in terms of product would be voluntary: a certain amount of product would be voluntarily foregone in exchange either for more leisure or in order to avoid subjective or material cost of working. To avoid misunderstanding, it should be emphasised that this construction does not neglect or minimise the hardship imposed on the owners of the factors whose income has fallen. These hardships may be severe, they may be socially intolerable. Compare what was said above concerning the neglect of income redistribution in the global welfare calculation. It is, of course, always possible to introduce additional value postulates concerning income distribution. 1 The literature is fairly voluminous. See especially the famous controversy between F. P. Graham and F. H. Knight. Graham, " Some Aspects of Protection Further Considered " (Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 37, 1923, p. 199 et 8eq.); Knight, " Some Fallacies in the Interpretation of Social Cost " (ibid., Vol. 38, 1924, p. 582; Reply and Rejoinder, ibid., Vol. 39).

Decreasing cost may be due to external economies. The assumption of external economies is, then, a way of making decreasing cost compatible with competition. External economies (or diseconomies for that matter) need, however, not be associated with decreasing cost. Social as well as private costs may be increasing, and the underlying situation may therefore be quite stable and still there may be a deviation between social and private cost due to external economies or dis- economies, i.e., due to certain cost-raising or cost-reducing factors which would come into play if one industry expanded and the other contracted-factors which for some reason or other are not, or not sufficiently, allowed for in private cost calculations. A m B FIG. 3. This situation is depicted in Fig. 3. Production initially takes place at P. The true, social ratio of transformation is given by the slope of the transformation curve (line I). The inter- national exchange ratio (again for simplicity assumed to be fixed) is given by the slope of line II. Commodity A being cheaper abroad ought to be imported in exchange for B. The country should move to p by production, and thence to (say) T by trade. But now we assume that the ratio of private marginal cost of A and B and hence the domestic price ratio does not correspond to the true social-transformation ratio. Suppose it is given by " Professor Graham's Case for Protection " (pp. 182-99) to a penetrating dia- grammatic analysis of the subject. On the broader issues about external and internal economies, private vs. social cost, the locus classicus is still Marshall's Principles and Industry and Trade and Pigou's Economics of Welfare.</page><page sequence="15">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 237 the slope of line III. The exchange ratio overvalues B and under- values A. This is due to external economies which could be realised and would lower the cost of production of B, if the B industry were expanded. These economies are, however, not recognised by B producers or for some other reasons fail to induce them to expand production.1 If the discrepancy between private and social cost is as large as assumed in Fig. 3, the country will show a comparative price advantage in the " wrong " commodity. According to line III, B is cheaper abroad. Hence B will be imported and A exported. The production point will move to the left, to say p', where the ratio of private marginal cost (slope of line IV) becomes equal to the international price ratio (slope of line II). p'o' of A is exported and o'T' imported. The new trading point, T', is inferior to P. This is, I believe, a correct representation of what Graham really meant.2,3 It is one thing, however, and an easy one at that, to point out the possible consequences of a divergence of private and social cost and to cite instances in which such a divergence is likely to arise. It is an entirely different and infinitely more difficult task first to demonstrate that such discrepancies do in fact occur fre- quently, persistently and on a large scale and to indicate con- cretely how these cases can be recognised and evaluated. Most economists who have given serious thought to these problems have reached the conclusion that roughly, and as a rule, the ratios of private money costs do reflect the true social real cost 1 There is not enough space here for a thorough discussion of why this may be so. But let me say that it would be gratuitous simply to assume ignorance. The reason may be that investments would have to be made the fruits of which cannot be appropriated by private individuals (e.g., investment in the skill of the working population). On that point the literature mentioned above should be consulted. It may be also noted, in parenthesis, that the existence of external economies involves a misallocation of resources in the absence of international trade. P would not be the optimum point. If I may be allowed to use briefly and inexactly community indifference curves, this could be demonstrated by pointing out that P is determined by the condition that an indifference line be tangent to line III, while the optimum point would be located at that point where an indifference curve is tangent to the transformation curve, that is somewhere to the right of P.. 2 If the discrepancy between the social and the private cost ratio is less ex- treme, i.e., if line III is steeper than line I, but less steep than line II, the country would specialise in the " right " direction but not sufficiently. It would after trade be better off than before, but it would not reach the optimum point T. In that case an export or import subsidy (rather than a tariff) would be indicated. 3 It is not, however, a literal rendering of what Graham said. Such a literal interpretation is not attempted. It presents considerable difficulties, because Graham was not too clear and seems to have changed his position in the course of the controversy. Cf. the literature quoted above, especially Viner and Tinbergen.</page><page sequence="16">238 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [JUNE ratios. Practically all economists recognise that there are exceptions to the rule, but they would insist that the burden of proof is on those who maintain that the exceptions are numerous, persistent, large, and, last but not least, practically recognisable and calculable.1 The theory of external economies is related to the reasoning underlying the infant-industry argument for protection, but the two are not identical.2 The essence of the latter can, I think, be described with the help of our diagrammatic apparatus, as shown in Fig. 4. We start this time with a situation where trade takes place, the production point being P, the trading point T. Suppose now that by means of an import tariff on A, production is shifted from P to P' and the new trading point is at T'.3 The new 1 We may again turn to Dr. Balogh's convenient store of all sorts of confusions to find an exception which proves the rule. He says: " It is wholly illicit to assume that money prices are proportionate to long run social real costs. We know that private money costs are not proportionate to social real costs, and neither are prices proportionate to private money costs " (loc. cit., pp. 189 and 190. Italics in original). Dr. Balogh is, of course, unable to give any proof; he just asserts and states impressions. I would not blame him for that, because such a statement as his could, in the nature of the case, not be proved within the frame of a few articles. But he accuses me of " invoicing high authorities instead of proving " my contention that there is a rough correspondence between relative prices and real social cost. He seems to be not aware of the fact that the " high authorities," in fact practically all leading economists who have dealt with these matters, have, if not " proved " (such a theorem cannot be neatly proved like an arithmetical proposition), given plenty of reasons for accepting the con- tended proposition. They all treat deviations between private and social costs as exceptions to the rule of correspondence. This is, -however, perfectly compat- ible with many shades of opinion about the relative importance or unimportance of these exceptions. Every leading economist who has dealt with these questions can be adduced (J. S. Mill, Marshall, Pigou, Taussig, Knight, Viner, etc.). Even Friedrich List could be read by Dr. Balogh with considerable profit. List was of the opinion that a manufacturing industry that cannot be kept alive on 20-30% tariff can be regarded as unsuited for the country concerned. (Das Nationale System der Politischen Okonomie, Edition Berliner, 1930, p. 326.) Protection of 20-30% ad valorem has to be regarded as very moderate nowadays. Dr. Balogh makes a lot of special risks attaching to foreign trade as an argu- ment for protection and discrimination. It is true that the ultra-protectionist and chauvinistic economic policies advocated by Dr. Balogh which most countries have been now pursuing for many years (without waiting for Dr. Balogh's recom- mendations) have enormously increased the risk of investment abroad and at home for the purpose of building up export industries. But surely this fact cuts the other way than Dr. Balogh thinks. It increases the importance of expanding rather than of restricting international trade. 2 On that I agree now with Viner (Studies, p. 482), while in my Theory of International Trade I held that Graham's case was but a variant of the infant- industry argument for protection. However, in view of the vagueness which attaches to much of the discussion and in view of the fact that different shades of each theory can be found, there would be not much point in a historical investi- gation about the closeness of their interrelation. 3 The international terms are again assuamed to be fixed. But that is not essential for the argument. The domestic terms of trade (internal price ratio</page><page sequence="17">1950] PURE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE 239 situation is inferior to T, which represents the fact that, with the assumptions made, protection is necessarily detrimental.' The essence of the infant-industry argument is that a move- ment on the transformation curve will bring about an irreversible shift of the curve itself. Concretely, if the A-industry is protected and expands, methods of production will gradually be perfected, skills will be acquired, and so the short-run curve AB will assume the long-run shape A'B. The production point will shift to P". In the new situation trade may or may not take place, and the country may export either A or B, i.e., the trading point may be on either side of P" depending upon " demand conditions."2 A A T1 T pi B FIG. 4. Again, it is an easy thing to state the assumptions, to derive the conclusions and to recognise that in principle the possibility must not be ignored that deliberate movements on the production- opportunity curve may shift the curve itself. But it should also be remembered that, in principle, the shifts may be in either direction; there may be external diseconomies as well as economies, including the tariff) is equal to the slope of the transformation curve at P', and the height of the tariff is given by the difference between the slope of the trans- formation curve and the slope of the trading line. 1 If we drop the assumption that foreign demand is infinitely elastic and assume instead that the terms of trade for the protected country improve, pro- tection may be beneficial. This would be shown in our diagram by making the trading line steeper (not shown in the diagram). If it becomes sufficiently steep, T' may reach a position superior to T. In fact, as is well known, it can be shown that unless foreign demand is infinitely elastic there is always some tariff which makes T' superior to T. 2 In terms of indifference curves: depending upon whether an indifference curve is tangent to the trading line at P" or to the left or right of it. No. 238-VOL. LX. R</page><page sequence="18">240 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [JUNE 1950 and the possibility of favorable shifts in production-opportunity curve is not confined to import commodities. Improvements may just as well be realisable in the export industries, in which case the opposite of a trade restriction would be indicated. In other words, the argument may cut either way, and it is a little suspicious that the argument is practically always used in one direction, that is to say for the justification of protection rather than of freer trade. To go beyond the statement of possibilities, to generalise about the overall importance of the infant-industry effect, and to evaluate it in concrete cases is an extremely difficult task which requires not only theoretical acumen, but intimate empirical knowledge of industrial development and, above all, historical perspective. Most leading economists, beginning from J. S. Mill, Marshall, Taussig to Pigou and Viner, accept the principles. But those who made empirical studies, like Marshall and Taussig, became in the course of their studies somewhat sceptical with respect to the scope of the principle, and even more so concerning the chances of a rational application. It is to be hoped that the rapidly growing literature on the problem of developing under- developed countries will eventually add to our knowledge of these matters. But that is beyond the scope of the present paper. GOTTFRIED HABERLER Harvard University.</page></plain_text>
