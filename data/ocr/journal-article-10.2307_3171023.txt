If the subject is archetexture-the arche of texture as well as the texture of the arche-if the subject is, in one way or the other, the arche or the beginning, then where are we to begin? I will try to begin by exploring something near and dear to us all . . . a pocket. What is a pocket? The question seems banal. But is it? Are we sure we know what a pocket is? Are we confident we can comprehend the im- plications of its substitute-a pocketbook? Can there be such a thing as a pocketbook? Or does the pocket make the book impossible? Is the pocket inside or outside? Is it, per- haps, neither inside nor outside but rather "invaginated" inside out and outside in? In an essay entitled "Living On/Border Lines," Derrida briefly touches the question of the pocket in the context of his consideration of Blanchot's remarkable recit, L'Arrit de mort, which can be translated Death Sentence. That they, these two other women, others of the other, should not merely resemble each other but should be the same: this is what he desires, what he would die of, what he desires like the death that he would 'give' himself. This is absolute terror: the boundless abyss of that which is single, unique-the other death, laughable, the most simply insignificant death, the most fatal. And immediately la Chose is its double. It remains [reste] its double. At about ten o'clock Nathalie said to me: 'I telephoned X., I asked him to make a cast of my head and my hands.' Right away I was seized by a feeling of terror. 'What gave you the idea of doing that?' 'The card.' She showed me the sculptor's card which was usually with the key in my wallet. 17</page><page sequence="2">1.-'</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 5 Should we say that he gave her the idea of or desire for the death mask, as he had wished to embalm other women, in order to preserve both of them, to keep them alive-and-dead, living on? Yes and no. Yes, because it is indeed thanks to him, next to him, on him, that she finds this 'idea.' No, because she finds them only by stealing them from him, from a place where he was hiding them, in a crypt, a crypt next to his body, clinging to his skin, the wallet, an object that is detachable from him, nei- ther clothing nor itself a body, a safe containing other detachable objects, a card, keys, they operate, orient, open, close; they make something readable or keep it secret.I By digging into our pockets, Blanchot and Derrida suggest, we find a crypt. Is this really so? Let's see. I would like to ask you to dig into your pockets or into your supplemen- tary pockets-your pocketbooks, and pull out a dollar, a single dollar bill. Hold it for a moment. Derrida begins Of Grammatology with a textual supple- ment that he labels "Exergue." "Exergue," which derives from the Greek ex, "out of," + ergon, "work," probably was intended to be a rendering of the French "hors d'oeuvre." The exergue is a small place, usually on the reverse of a coin or metal, for any minor inscription. Our basic token of exchange is now no longer metal but paper. We trade in papers that are signs whose value is arbitrary. There is no stable referent, no "transcendental signified" that secures the signs we swap. Our currency floats freely. The sign of the groundless sign that "grounds" our econ- omy is the same sign that Lacan uses to mark the split or cracked subject: a barred S-$. If grammatology begins with an exergue, we might begin our examination of the texture of the arche by looking more closely at the backside of a dollar bill. Capitalism (and, for reasons that will soon become appar- ent, it is important to remember the association of the cap- ital and the head, established by way of the Latin caput, meaning head-though we also recognize other meanings of kaput) can be understood as an "ontotheological" econ- omy. "Ontotheology" is Heidegger's term for the dominant philosophical tradition in the West. This economy is polit- ical, social, psychological, religious, and artistic. The guid- ing principle of this tradition is fundamentalist belief; more precisely, it is the belief in the fundaments named Identity, Unity, Being, and Presence. The God in whom ontothe- ology trusts is the omnipresent ONE. This ONE is the principle that founds every united state. The ideal of the capitalist economy is printed on the scroll held in the beak of an eagle: E Pluribus Unum, From Many, One. All of this is, of course, on the exergue of the dollar. But something else is inscribed on the underside of the dollar. The eagle that is supposed to bring oneness from manyness occupies the face of the Great Seal, depicted to the right of the ONE. To the left of the ONE is located the backside of the Seal. This exergue within an exergue is strange: a pyramid that is, in words Hegel uses in the Phenomenology to describe the role of the unconscious in the struggle between Antigone and Creon, "a pyramid with its very tip knocked off."2 Above the decapitated pyramid on the backside of the foundation of capitalism is an eye in the middle of a triangle. Whose eye is this and what does the triangle represent? The Journals of the Continental Congress tell us that the eye is God's and suggest that the triangle reflects the trinity. The image of the eye within a triangle surrounded by rays of the sun is a common sym- bol for the all-seeing, panoptical, penal, eagle-eye of God. God's eye is always the right eye. But is the eye in the exergue the right eye? We cannot be certain. It is possible, perhaps likely, that William Barton, designer of the seal, borrowed the triangulated eye from the apron of the Free- masons. The "father" of the country, whose image adorns the face of the dollar and whose monument is a monu- mental obelisk, was a Mason. Washington is often pictured standing erect with a Masonic apron veiling his generative organ. In a well-known etching, the first president wears an apron embroidered by Madame Lafayette. Such aprons usually depict "small temple buildings reminiscent of the Pantheon in Paris; and columns topped with [fruit, as well as] land- scape scenes with Egyptian elements such as sphinxes and obelisks ... ."I Almost every apron design includes an eye, in the middle of a triangle, inserted between two erect col- umns. Examining these eyes carefully, we make a surpris- ing discovery: the Masonic eye is often the left eye. While 18</page><page sequence="4">Taylor 4IAI -. . .. . 78 7B:I',i ~ WR . . ........... .... the right eye is a traditional symbol of the sun, day, and the future, the left eye is a common symbol of the moon, night, and the past. Might this past have something to do with the strange arche for which we are searching? In view of the image of the pyramid under the eye, it is perhaps noteworthy that the Egyptian god of the moon is Thoth, the nocturnal representative of Ra (the god for whom obelisks usually are constructed). The figure of Thoth, Derrida explains, is opposed to its other (father, sun, life, speech, origin or orient, etc.), but as that which at once supplements and supplants it. Thoth extends or opposes by repeating or replacing. By the same token, the figure of Thoth takes shape and takes its shape from the very thing it resists and for which it substitutes. But it thereby opposes itself, passes into its other, and this messenger-god is truly a god of the absolute passage between opposites. If he had any identity-but he is precisely the god of nonidentity-he would be that coincidentia oppositorum to which we will soon have re- course again. . . . The god of writing is thus at once his father, his son, and himself. He cannot be assigned a fixed spot in the play of differences. Sly, slippery, and masked, an intriguer and a card, like Hermes, he is neither king nor jack, but rather a sort of joker, a floating signifier, a wild card, who puts play into play.4 From pocket, to crypt, to dollar, to exergue, to eagle, to pyramid, to triangle, to eye, to Thoth, the Egyptian god who invented writing. The course seems errant, and the question of archetexture remains obscure. Perhaps things will become a bit clearer if we move from capitalism to a distant capital, a capital from which we really have never been very far. With this move, I am trying to think the space of postmodernism by rethinking the problem of time. To think time radically is to think something like the arche-texture of pyramids. It is possible to think this cryptic archetexture by exploring the architecture of the capital- the capital named Paris. This is, of course, an enormous undertaking. I will limit my remarks to a certain axis near the center of the city: Etoile-Place de la Concorde- Louvre. In exploring this axis, my guides will be Merleau- Ponty, Bataille, and Derrida. By considering the archetex- ture of the capital, I hope to be able to rethink the System of the philosopher in whom ontotheology comes to clo- sure: Hegel, whose name, Derrida tells us on the first page of Glas, sounds like the imperial Eagle. My question is whether the archetexture of the pyramid subverts the Sys- tem of the philosopher who brings modern philosophy to completion and thereby marks the opening of the space of postmodernism. The Etoile is located at the center of a circle from which rays extend and to which they return to ensure the orderly 19</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 5 circulation of traffic. In the midst of this circle stands the Arc de Triomphe. Etoile means star. But it also can desig- nate a star that is a crack in glass. Etoiler means to star and to crack; etoilement can be translated either as starring or cracking. At the other end of Les Champs Elysees (which means, of course, the Elysian Fields) is the Place de la Concord. In the middle of the Place stands an Egyp- tian obelisk, covered with hieroglyphics and capped by a pyramid. This obelisk stands on the site once occupied by the guillotine-the site of decapitation, the place where reason finally lost its head. Beyond the Place de la Con- cord, at the end of the axis opposite the Etoile is the Lou- vre. In the middle of the Louvre there is arising, at this very moment, a pyramid-a glass pyramid. Etoile . . . obelisk . . . pyramid-a glass pyramid. This axis might be understood as the figure of a critique of Hegel that culmi- nates in the cryptic text named Glas. Modern philosophy, which begins with Descartes's inward turn and ends with the absolute self-consciousness seem- ingly achieved in Hegel's System, is a philosophy of the subject. The modern subject is both constructive and re- flexive. This subject posits itself in its thinking and doing and returns to itself through an act of recollection that re- turns all differences to its own complex identity. The sub- ject of speculative philosophy is a specular subject that sees itself reflected everywhere-in nature as well as in history, in objects as well as in other subjects. Hegel gives his most concise definition of this subject when he describes spirit as "pure self-recognition in absolute otherness.'1" It is im- portant to realize that the Hegelian subject or spirit (for our purposes, these two terms can be used interchangeably) must not be understood simply in individual terms. The subject is absolute; it is both universal and particular. In the Hegelian dialectic, part and whole are isomorphic. For both the universal and the particular subject, the recog- nition of the self in the other is the sublation (Aufhebung) of otherness through which self-identity is achieved. The subject's movement from and return to itself can be under- stood in terms of space and time. The goal of philosophy is the enjoyment of presence. Presence, of course, has both a spatial and a temporal dimension. The absolute subject becomes itself in and through the processes of na- ture and history. Spirit realizes itself first by externalizing itself in space, as nature, and in time, as history, and then by returning to itself in and through human self-conscious- ness. This circular process reaches completion in the absolute knowledge of Hegel's System. The philosopher's knowledge of the absolute is at the same time the abso- lute's knowledge of itself. In theological language, man's self-knowledge is God's self-knowledge and vice versa. The subject-both human and divine, for in the final analysis these two are one-becomes totally present to itself in and through acts of representation in which the subject re- presents itself to itself. The total presence of the subject is the Parousia-the appearance of essence, which is the realization of the salvation promised in the Christian reli- gion. With the arrival of the eschaton, space and time are, in effect, overcome. Absolute knowledge is perfect copula- tion of subject and object, self and other, which issues in certain conception. The certainty of this conception over- comes the uncertainty of Cartesian doubt.6 Hegel's final solution has always met with suspicion on the part of many of his most sensitive and insightful interpret- ers. The sensualism of Feuerbach, materialism of Marx, and individualism of Kierkegaard all ask what the System leaves out. Nowhere have these questions about Hegel's System been developed with greater rigor than in French literature and philosophy. The works of many of France's most important twentieth-century writers can be under- stood as extended responses to Hegel's philosophy. For these thinkers, Hegelianism does not end with his System but extends into this century in the guise of Husserlian phenomenology and structuralism. If Hegel is understood as a proto-structuralist and structuralism as latter-day Hegelianism, post-structuralism can be read as an extended critique of Hegel's systematic philosophy. Since Hegelian- ism is the culmination of modern philosophy, post-struc- turalism is, by extension, postmodern. By concentrating on the work of Merleau-Ponty, Bataille, and Derrida, it is pos- sible to see the way in which the critique of Hegel contin- ues to shape the current critical landscape. Though not immediately apparent, all of this does have something to do with the archetexture of pyramids. 20</page><page sequence="6">Taylor 2. Etienne-Louis Boullee, cenotaph to the military hero Marechal Turenne, c. 1785 Merleau-Ponty is rarely considered in the context of post- structuralism. This is understandable, for clearly he cannot be classified as a post-structuralist. Nevertheless, his late writings anticipate many of the most important insights of recent critics of structuralism. In his early work, Pheno- menology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty outlines the genesis of the subject of modern philosophy: "The Cartesian doc- trine of the cogito," he writes, "was . . . bound to lead logically to the assertion of the timelessness of spirit, and to the admission of a consciousness of the eternal . . . Eternity, understood as the power to embrace and antici- pate temporal developments in a single intention, becomes the very definition of subjectivity."7 If the subject consti- tutes or constructs its world, then the subject appears to be liberated from the uncertainties and vicissitudes of tem- poral existence. In his important posthumous work, The Visible and the Invisible, Merleau-Ponty describes the eter- nal vision of the reflective subject as "high-altitude thought" (la pensee en survol), which results from the sovereign gaze of "the eagle." The perfect knowledge revealed to the "eagle-eye" of the reflective philosopher realizes the dream of the Western philosophical tradition. There is, however, a high price to be paid for this vision-a price that is noth- ing less than time itself. The birth of eternally constructive subjectivity is the death of the passionate temporal subject. "It is the dream of philosophers," Merleau-Ponty explains, "to conceive an 'eternity of life,' lying beyond permanence and change, in which time's productivity is pre-eminently contained, and yet a thetic consciousness of time that dominates and embraces it merely destroys the phenome- non of time."8 Merleau-Ponty is convinced that this dream cannot be realized, for he discerns an unavoidable "blind spot" in the philosopher's eagle-eye. Claims to the contrary notwithstanding, absolute knowl- edge remains forever inaccessible to the temporal subject. Echoing Heidegger's insistence that ontotheology consti- tutes itself by forgetting its origin, Merleau-Ponty contends that the philosopher who claims to know universal truth forgets the inescapable non-knowledge from which his re- flection repeatedly departs. The experience that nourishes reflection cannot itself be known. In an effort to return to what the speculative philosopher represses, Merleau-Ponty charts a course that leads from the Etoile along Les 21</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 5 Champs Elysdes to Notre-Dame and back again. Those who follow this route discover that the return of the re- pressed is the re-turn of time that exposes the irreducible absence of space. As we will see, the "of" in the phrase "absence of space" must be read in at least two ways. The achievement of the total self-consciousness requisite for absolute knowledge presupposes that the reflective sub- ject returns to itself from its self-objectification in objects of knowledge. As I have stressed, if knowledge is not to be incomplete, the self must discover itself in everything that appears to be other than itself. In one of his richest and most influential criticisms of the reflexivity of self- consciousness, Merleau-Ponty writes: The philosophy of reflection . . . thinks it can comprehend our natal bond with the world only by undoing it in order to remake it, only by constituting it, by fabricating it. . . . It is, therefore, essential to the philosophy of reflection that it bring us back, this side of our de facto situation, to a center of things from which we proceed, but from which we were decentered, that it retravel, this time starting from us, a route already traced out from that center to us. . .. For the movement of recovery, of recuperation, of return to self, the progression toward internal adequation, the very effort to coincide with a nature, which is already ourselves and which is supposed to unfold the things and the world before itself. . . these operations of re-constitution or reestablishment, which come second, cannot in principle be the mirror image of its internal constitution and its establishment, as the route from the Etoile to Notre-Dame is the inverse of the route from Notre- Dame to the Etoile; the reflection recuperates everything except itself as an effort of recuperation, it clarifies everything except its own role. The eye of spirit or the mind's eye also has its blind spot but, because it is of spirit or of the mind, it cannot be un- aware of [this blind spot], nor treat it as a simple state of non- vision. . . . If it is not unaware of itself. . . reflection cannot feign to unravel the same thread that the mind would first have woven .... 9 In this important passage, Merleau-Ponty argues that the irreducible temporality of subjectivity "decenters" self- consciousness in two ways. In the first place, reflection is secondary to an experience that eludes conceptual compre- hension. This inaccessible origin of the world of experi- ence effectively deconstitutes or deconstructs the subject's constitutive or constructive acts. In the second place, the achievement of self-consciousness takes time. Merleau- Ponty uses the imaginary journey from the Etoile to Notre- Dame and back to suggest the inevitable delay between the constituting act and the return of the constructive subject to itself through the process of re-collection. The interval between the centrifugal and centripetal moments of self- consciousness disrupts the coincidence of origin and con- clusion in the life of the subject. As a result of this delay, the consummation of the union of subjectivity and objec- tivity remains a dream whose realization is perpetually "deferred," or to use Merleau-Ponty's term, "differee." Temporal deferral opens a space in the subject that self- consciousness can never close. This invisible space blinds the speculative philosopher. And it is this blindness that preoccupies Bataille. The goal of speculative philosophy is concord. Through rational mediation, the philosopher attempts to reconcile hostile opponents that are engaged in a struggle or battle for mastery. The French word for battle is bataille. The French name of the place of concord is Place de la Con- cord. As I have already noted, in the middle of the Place de la Concord (on the site once occupied by the guillotine) there is an obelisk that previously stood in front of a temple in the Egyptian village of Luxor, located next to Thebes, which was the home of Oedipus. In a brief essay bearing the seminal title "Rotten Sun," Bataille suggests a startling series of associations that begin to illuminate this obelisk. In mythology, the scrutinized sun is identified with a man who slays a bull (Mithra), with a vulture that eats the liver (Prome- theus); in other words, with the man who looks along with the slain bull or the eaten liver. The Mithraic cult of the sun led to a very widespread religious practice: people stripped in a kind of a pit [a pit that anticipates the one in Derrida's important essay on Hegel's Semiology, "The Pit and the Pyramid"] that was covered with a wooden scaffold, on which a priest slashed the throat of a bull; thus they were suddenly doused with hot blood, to the ac- companiment of the bull's boisterous struggle and bellowing. ... Of course the bull himself is also the image of the sun, but only with his throat slit. . . . One might add that the sun has also been mythologically expressed by a man slashing his own throat, as well as by an anthropomorphic being deprived of a head. All of this leads one to say that the summit of elevation is in practice 22</page><page sequence="8">Taylor confused with a sudden fall of unheard-of violence. The myth of Icarus is particularly expressive from this point of view ....10 I can only begin to point out the complexity of the net- work of images that Bataille is suggesting: a petrified col- umn erected in honor of the sun god, Ra; speculative philosophy as the purest light of reason, which perfectly expresses the truth anticipated in the incarnation of the Son of God, the light of the world; the obelisk marking the site of the terrifying end of the rebellion against the grand- son of the Sun King; the obelisk as Hegel's own example of the sign of a sign, which, like his other illustration of the sign, the pyramid, is an empty tomb or a dead letter yet to be elevated or res-erected to reason in which perfect harmony is a function of complete copulation-the copu- lation of subject and object that gives birth to thought through effective conception; the incised obelisk covered with hieroglyphics, which is a strange reminder of Egypt, land of Oedipus; a stone column-petrification as the im- age of castration; castration, which is also figured as decap- itation; decapitation as the undoing of the capital, the capitol, and capitalism-especially the capitalization of the I; castration as cruel cut that makes copulation and con- ception impossible; the scaffold as the sacrificial altar, which is the place of excessive transgression. I could go on, but this should be enough to suggest some of what is at work in Bataille's text. Let us return to Icarus. Having flown too close to the sun, his wings melt and he falls (it is important to note that the French word for fall, tombe, is also the word for tomb) into the sea. (Since we are already engaged in the Oedipal triangle, I should stress that the French word for sea, la mer, is homophonic with the word for mother, la mere. Furthermore, the Egyptian word for pyramid is, unbeliev- ably enough, Mer. The reader who knows Lacan will be able to extend this series of associations. It is clear that Bataille and Lacan shared more than a woman named Syl- via.) Bataille relates Icarus and his "high-altitude flight" (survol, the same word we have already discovered in Merleau-Ponty) to the soaring of the eagle. This eagle is, for Bataille, as for Merleau-Ponty and Derrida, the image of the philosopher, Hegel. In an essay entitled simply "The Obelisk," Bataille ap- proaches Hegel's speculative philosophy by way of a con- sideration of the pyramid-topped obelisk located in the middle of the Place de la Concord. According to Bataille, the obelisk "is without a doubt the purest image of the head and the heavens." Recalling a "petrified sunbeam," the firmly fixed obelisk is the "Egyptian image of the IMPERISHABLE." As such, it "is the surest and most durable obstacle to the drifting away of things."" When the obelisk is understood in this way, it is possible to inter- pret Hegel's speculative philosophy as something like an obelisk. As I have already suggested, Hegelian recollection purports to take perishable temporal and spatial existence up into the eternal life of the concept. As Merleau-Ponty points out, the completion of philosophy presupposes the repression of time. But can time be forever repressed? Over against the obelisk of speculative philosophy, Bataille sets "The Pyramid of Suleri." This pyramid is the pyra- midal rock in the lake of Silvaplana that occasioned Nietzsche's ecstatic experience of the eternal return. For Bataille, the pyramid of Suleri is the figure of the eternal return of time, which frustrates the monumental desire of the philosopher. Describing Nietzsche's shattering experi- ence, Bataille writes, In order to represent the decisive break that took place . it is necessary to tie the sundering vision of the 'return' to what Nietzsche experienced when he reflected upon the explosive vision of Heraclitus, and to what he experienced later in his own vision of the 'death of God.' . . . TIME is the object of the vision of Heraclitus. TIME is unleashed in the 'death' of the One [I want to stress this: TIME is unleashed in the 'death' of the One] whose eternity gave Being an immutable foundation. And the audacious act that represents the 'return' at the summit of this laceration only wrests from the death of God his total strength, in order to give it to the deleterious absurdity of time ... .12 "The deleterious absurdity of time," inscribed in Nietzsche's eternal re-turn, involves a fall that, Bataille in- sists, is final. This is the fall from which the philosopher is always attempting to recover, la tombe he is always at- tempting to recover. But his efforts are futile, for the re- pressed, that is to say, time, eternally returns. The eternal return of the fall of time is marked by a tombe/tomb--a 23</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 5 3. Man Ray, Object to Be Destroyed, 1958 replica of 1923 original tomb in the form of a pyramid. This pyramid is the crypt of the ONE that founds and grounds Western philosophy, religion, psychology, society, and culture. The sound (and we should remember that in French, the word "sound" is "son," the English word "son"), the sound of this empty tomb, if such empty space sounds, is glas-glas, which is the death knell of the West. Pursuing a style of questioning initiated by Heidegger, Der- rida repeatedly attempts to think what the Western philo- sophical tradition has left unthought. Heidegger argues that though ontotheology is preoccupied with the question of Being, or more precisely with the presence of Being in all beings, philosophers working in this tradition never raise the question of the origin of the presence of Being as such. From Heidegger's point of view, what needs to be thought is the difference in and through which both Being and beings are determined. He labels this difference the "onto- logical difference." Though persuaded that Heidegger remains bound to and by the tradition he attempts to dismantle, Derrida recognizes the importance of Heideg- ger's interrogation of Western philosophy and culture. In- deed there is no single thinker who is more important for Derrida than Heidegger. Derrida's writings can be read as various efforts to think the difference that Heidegger de- scribes as the unthought of Western philosophy. This dif- ference is, in Maurice Blanchot's terms, "the non-absent absence" that is the space of time and the time of space. 13 To think difference as such or to think difference as differ- ence is to think a difference that is neither an identity nor its binary opposite, a difference. To suggest this irreducibly liminal difference, Derrida coins the neologism diffirance, which, he insists, is "neither a word nor a concept." This curious non-concept is intended to underscore two con- trasting dimensions of diffirer: temporalization and spacing. As the irreducible margin along which time and space in- terweave, diffgrance is the matrix of all presence and ab- sence. In his essay entitled "Diffgrance," Derrida explains, In constituting itself, in dividing itself dynamically, this interval is what might be called spacing [espacement], the becoming-space of time or the becoming-time of space (temporalization). And it is this constitution of the present, as an 'originary' and irreducibly nonsimple (and therefore, in the strict sense of the term, nonori- 24</page><page sequence="10">Taylor ginary) synthesis of marks, or traces of retentions and protentions S . . that I propose to call archi-writing [archi-ecriture] or archi- trace [archi-trace]. Which (is) (simultaneously) spacing (and) tem- poralization. 14 With the question of diffrance, we return to the problem of the arche. Diffgrance is, in some sense, the arche of both the differences and the identities that make up the world of experience. This arche, however, is a strange source, for it is neither simply an origin nor a ground. To the contrary, it is a "nonoriginal origin" that escapes the polarity of ground and grounded. As the condition of the possibility of presence and absence, diffirance itself is nei- ther present nor absent. Since it is never present, it cannot be re-presented or represented. Diffirance is, to borrow a phrase from Emmanuel Levinas, the "unrepresentable be- fore." This unrepresentable before is an absolute past-that is to say, a past that never was, is, or will present. The non-presence (which is not exactly an absence) of this arche disturbs all presence and disrupts every present. 'Older' than Being itself-Derrida explains-such a diffrance has no name in our language. But we 'already know' that if it is unnamable, it is not provisionally so, not because our language has not yet found or received this name, or because we would have to seek it in another language, outside the finite system of our own. It is rather because there is no name for it at all, not even the name of essence or of Being, not even that of 'diff- rance,' which is not a name, which is of a pure nominal unity, and unceasingly dislocates itself in a chain of differing and defer- ring substitutions. 15 Diffrance is, then, the impossible "name" of the name- less. The difference between diffirance and difference is a single letter-the letter with which writing begins, "A." With this "A," Derrida attempts to write that which spells the end of every philosophical system based upon the prin- ciple of the ONE, which is otherwise known as Identity, Unity, Being, and Presence. This diffgrance, however, is not simply outside of or opposite to the structure it calls into question. If it were merely outside or opposite, diff&amp;- rance would still remain within the structure of binary opposition. Diffirance is, paradoxically, inside. So under- stood, diffgrance is something like a pocket-a pocket that is an "invaginated" outside turned inside or inside turned outside. To discover diffrance in the midst of the economy of on- totheology, we need only go back to our own pockets and look again at the exergue of the ONE dollar bill. A re- examination of the pyramid with the tip knocked off im- printed in the exergue of the exergue to the left of the God in whom we trust (that is, the ontotheological God of Oneness) unexpectedly discloses the letter "A." Might this "A" be the "A" of diffrance? Perhaps. Consider Derrida's comment in the opening pages of "Diffirance:" Therefore, preliminarily, let me recall that this discreet graphic intervention [the substitution of the a for the e in diffirance] came to be formulated in the course of a written investigation on a question about writing. Now it happens . . that this graphic difference . . . , this marked difference between two apparently vocal notations, between two vowels, remains purely graphic: it is read, or it is written, but it cannot be heard. It cannot be appre- hended in speech, and we will see why it also bypasses the order of apprehension in general. It is offered by a mute mark, by a tacit monument, I would even say by a pyramid, thinking not only of the form of the letter when it is printed as a capital, but also of the text in Hegel's Encyclopedia in which the body of the sign is compared to the Egyptian Pyramid. The a of diffrance, thus, is not heard; it remains silent, secret and discreet, as a tomb. . . . And thereby let us anticipate the delineation of a site, the familial residence and the tomb of the proper in which is produced, by diffirance, the economy of death. This stone-pro- vided one knows how to decipher its inscription-is not far from announcing the death of the king.16 Glas, which means, among many other things, death knell, is the inscription of diffrance, the writing of an economy of death that is l'arret de mort-a death sentence. This sentence of death is written in the form of a pyramid, an empty tomb that is the mark of the inescapability of the time of death rather than the sign of the effective death of time. Toward the end of Glas, Derrida returns to the eter- nal return of time by suggesting an unexpected relation between absolute knowledge and Saturn. To appreciate the force of this passage, it is necessary to note that Derrida abbreviates absolute knowledge, savoir absolu, as Sa, which is homophonic with ga, the French word for id. It is also useful to recall that in one of his more effusive moments, Hegel describes the Phenomenology of Spirit as "the bac- chanalian revel in which no member is sober." 25</page><page sequence="11">assemblage 5 One could speak as well-the two words are closely related-of Sa's saturnalia. Festival in honor of Saturn: the Italic god who had been identified with Kronos (an empty play on words and this was the time-that one here would come to celebrate as Sa). He would have taken refuge in Italy after his son had dethroned him and thrown him down from the heights of Olympus. With the aid of his mother, Gaia, he himself had cut off the testicles of his father. It is again Gaia who already put the sickle between the hands of her son. It is, perhaps, she again who joins forces with Zeus, her grandson, against Kronos, her son, and made him drink a pharmakon that forced him to vomit all the children he had eaten. Saturn [that is, Sa or savoir absolu, absolute knowl- edge] would, then, be a deposed father [perhaps a dead king], whose Latin reign, nevertheless, had permitted the memory of a mythic golden age. He had become the god of agriculture, and more precisely, armed with a sickle and billhook, he used to pre- side over the cutting of the vine. Like Dionysus-Bacchus, he was closely associated with wine. 17 In these carefully crafted lines, Sa, absolute knowledge, appears to be the play of the gods: Saturn . . . Kronos . . . Dionysus-Bacchus. If interpreted in a certain way, this suggestion can be in- cluded in the Hegelian System. Hegel is convinced that the dialectic of religion culminates in the absolute religion, Christianity, which is the Vorstellung, or the represent- ation, of absolute knowledge. Derrida reformulates Hegel's claim: "The absolute religion is not yet what it is already: Sa. The absolute religion (the essence of Christianity, the religion of essence) is already what it is not yet: Sa, which itself is already no longer what it still is, the absolute reli- gion.'18 The liminal non-place of Vorstellung is time. In Hegel's own terms, time is the "Dasein" of the concept, or as Derrida phrases it, "time is the concept itself, which is there (der das ist)."'9 "The Da of the concept (time)," Der- rida explains, "marks the incompleteness, its interior de- fault, the semantic void that holds it in motion. Time is always of this vacancy with which Sa affects itself. Because it affects itself with this, Sa empties itself, with a view to determining itself, it procrastinates, it gives itself time. The Da of Sa is nothing other than the movement of signifi- cation."20 For Hegel, the "vacuous" movement of signifi- cation ends in the semantic plenitude of knowledge. In the fullness of time, the unsettling emptiness of temporal rep- resentation becomes the reassuring fullness of eternal pres- entation. This atemporal present/presence marks the advent of the Parousia.21 From Derrida's perspective, the realized eschatology of the System is an impossibility. In an effort to expose this im- possibility, Derrida abbreviates "the absolute of the already- there of the not-yet or of the yet of the already-no-more" (the French reads le ddja-ld du pas-encore ou l'encore du ddja-plus) with pas-ld (the being-there [da] of the not [pas], which, being there, is not, is not there).22 Pas-ld, not there: this abbreviation provides a concise summary of Derrida's critique of Hegelianism and all it represents. Knowledge, truth (of the) phantasm (of) (absolute) philosophy- (absolute) religion, this proposition delineates no limit, is the infi- nite proposition . . . of speculative dialectics. The infinite circle of autoinsemination that entails the paidea of every seminar in its phantasm. What can there be outside of an absolute phantasm? What is one still able to add? Why and how to desire to get out of it? It is necessary to delay-to give oneself time. The re- main(s) of time.23 The pas-ld (the not there) is the remain(s), which "is" both "always already" and forever "remain(s)." This restless re- mainder (the French word is "reste," which can be either a noun or a verb) repeats the excessive alteration of fort/da in which the da (the there) of the fort (the gone) is the fort (the gone) of the da (the there). The ceaseless play of this fort/da is the eternal return of time. Forever beyond the pleasure principle, the repetition of fort/da, binds us to death. Death, however, is never present, though it is not absent. As the non-absent absence that forever haunts pres- ence-my presence and my present-death approaches yet never arrives. This approach is the apocalypse of the apocalypse, the end of the end that exposes an unending opening, which is an incurable wound. This petrifying opening, this mortal wound is figured in an "A," an "A" that sometimes is figured as a pyramid with its tip knocked off. Concord, to the Louvre. Etoile, shattered glass. Place de la Concord, pillar of stone with a pyramid at the tip. Louvre, a glass pyramid. If the tomb in the form of a glass pyramid 26</page><page sequence="12">Taylor has anything to do with what Derrida describes as the "py- ramidal silence" of the "A" of diffirance, then the glass pyramid opening in the middle of the grandest monument to art might be read in terms of the pyramidal text named Glas (and, of course, vice versa). This text opens the arche of every text-an arche that is the non-original origin eter- nally returning as the end that never arrives. The dilemma the postmodern architect faces is how to inscribe the space of this time-the non-present space of a time that never was, is, or will be present. This is also the dilemma of the writer. In some sense, every text implies the arche-text-ure of pyramids and every archetect is a writer. Notes 1.

In the following text from Of Grammatology, Der- rida underscores the importance of this issue. "The horizon of absolute knowledge is the effacement of writ- ing in the logos, the retrieval of the trace in parousia, the reappropria- tion of difference, the accomplish- ment of what I have elsewhere called the metaphysics of the proper [le propre-self-possession, propri- ety, property, cleanliness]. Yet, all that Hegel thought within this hori- zon, all, that is, except eschatology, may be reread as a meditation on writing. Hegel is also the first thinker of irreducible difference. He rehabilitated thought as the memory productive of signs. And he reintro- duced, as I shall try to show else- where, the essential necessity of the written trace in a philosophical- that is to say, Socratic--discourse that had always believed it possible to do without it; the last philoso- pher of the book and the first thinker of writing."
