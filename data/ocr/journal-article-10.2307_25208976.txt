Essay on the Pre- Vedic History of India and the Identity of the Early Mythologies of Europe and Asia, founded on a Study of the Brahmanas and of Sacrificial Observances. By J. F. Hewitt, Esq., M.R.A.S. In the previous papers of this series I have tried to trace in outline a truthful sketch of the general course of early Indian History. The evidence I have consulted and set forth has led me to believe that the government, social institutions, and the fundamental principles of the religion of the country all originated among tribes for the most part of Dravidian race, who came into India from the Euphrates valley. In dealing with this evidence I have tried to trace the origin of the tribes who successively and simultaneously ruled India, the races to which they be longed, and the religious beliefs they held. In doing this I have also adduced proofs to show that the same races who introduced civilized and stable government into India performed the same task in the countries of Western Asia, in Egypt, Greece, and Italy. In the course of my argument I have laid stress on the value of early religious and astro nomical history as a guide, not only to the social history of India, but to that of all countries ruled by immigrant tribes of Akkadian race. My conclusions as to Indian history were formed chiefly from a study of the Mahabharata and Rigveda, and these authorities were largely supplemented by references to Greek and Latin historians, to Akkadian and Assyrian history, and by information derived from the present state of the country, its religious movements and social institutions. The most valuable and conclusive evidence I have found</page><page sequence="2">320 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. in the course of my inquiries is that derived from the dis covery that the Hindus not only measured time in very early ages by a year reckoned by lunar months of twenty eight days each, but that the measurement of time and the accepted popular and official theology were most closely connected together. I have, I believe, in the previous papers of this series, proved that the lunar year was used by the people of India for ages before they adopted the solar year, which has now for thousands of years been the official measure of time. It was from a comparison of the Brahmanas with the Mahabharata and the writings of Indian astronomers that I have been able to show (1) That the most ancient gods of India were those who became afterwards gods of time; (2) That the fifty great gods of the Akkadians, early Hindus and Greeks, were the dominant gods of the two original years, the year of ten lunar months of twenty eight days each, which was afterwards extended by the result of astronomical observations to the full lunar year of thirteen months.1 I have further pointed out that Assyrian and Egyptian chronology prove that the solar year was first adopted about 4700 B.C., and that the beginnings of the very 1 I must here note what further inquiry has shown me to he an error in my discrimination of the fifty great gods. I treated them as being divided into the twenty-seven Nakshatra, or phases of the moon, which in the Hindu sacred calendar represented the lunar year, the lunar year of thirteen months and the ten months of the year of gestation. This is the division in the Mahabharata. But I have shown in the Appendix to this essay that the Nakshatra were originally twenty-eight in number, and that they represented the days of the lunar month, and that the twenty-seven Nakshatra used to denote the sacrificial year among the Hindus were only adopted as a measure of the year when the five years cycle reconciling the solar, lunar and sidereal year was formed. There is no evidence that this cycle was ever used in Greece, and consequently the fifty daughters of Endymion and Danaus must mean fifty-one gods including the father, namely, the twenty-eight days of the lunar month, the thirteen months of the lunar year, and the ten months of the year of gestation. These fifty great gods and their father, which include, as I show in the Appendix, Priam and bis fifty sons, must have been distributed all over the world long before sun worship and the solar year were introduced, and the interpretation given in the Mahabharata as to their number only proves that the whole system of measuring time by the moon had been so engrained in the public mind that it was necessary to connect the new solar measurement of time with the older lunar system before the innovation would be accepted by the people and by their priestly guides, whose instincts were essentially and even obstruction ally conservative. But both the lunar and solar systems of time measurement took their rise in the Euphrates valley, and from thence penetrated into other cjuntries. Such modifications as were made in those countries where astronomical studies were subsequently pursued principally consisted in endeavours made by adopting cycle measurements to adjust the difference of lunar and solar time.</page><page sequence="3">HISTORICAL VALUE OF SACRIFICIAL MANUALS. 321 gradual evolution of religious and scientific inquiry which produced the year of ten months, and the lunar year of thirteen months, must date from a very much more remote period. When examining the Satapatha and Aitareya Brahraanas in the course of these investigations, I was much struck with the value of the historical evidence to be gathered from them. I found everywhere strong confirmation of the general cor rectness of the deductions I had made from other sources of evidence, and a further and fuller study of these treatises has convinced me that they are most useful, and, in deed, indispensable guides to those who wish to trace out clearly the early stages of the history of Indian civilization. In the first beginning of national life religious observances were in all countries the earliest and most important of state ceremonies, and therefore a complete record of the successive changes in the national ritual, such as these and the other Brahrnanas furnish, indicate not only changes in religious belief, but must also give most trustworthy and accurate information as to the successive stages passed through by the people of the country during periods so remote as to be only dimly shadowed forth in the most ancient and darkest legends. A little consideration will show that this opinion is well founded, and that the evidence to be gathered from authori tative ritualistic manuals is of immeasurably greater value than that given by legends and traditions. These manuals are the authorized rules for the guidance of priests and sacrificers prepared by the official priesthood, who had for innumerable successive generations been the careful guardians of the ancient laws governing religious observances, which laws were looked on as involving the penalty of death for any breach of their injunctions. They therefore state with the utmost exactness, not only the ceremonial rules accepted as correct when these treatises were written, but also embody those handed down to the transcribers by their predecessors, beginning with those promulgated in the very earliest dawn of religious thought. In the course of ages no old ceremonies</page><page sequence="4">322 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. had been lost, but new ones were added on by an agglomera tive process, and each addition did not involve the alteration and abandonment of those previously accepted.1 But, it will be said, if these treatises were written by a priesthood which was, or claimed to be of Aryan descent, they would only give rules for the worship of gods recognized by Aryans, and would not tell anything about those to be observed in sacrificing to pre-Aryan deities. That this is not a correct conclusion may be at once proved by a reference to a statement in the Satapatha Brahmana that the sacrifice is of equal measure with the year,2 coupled with the further declarations that the year is Prajapati3 and the year is Vishnu.4 Now Prajapati is, as I shall prove, the moon-god, the god of the old lunar year, and Vishnu, originally Vasuki, is the snake sun-god of the solar-lunar year, and neither are Aryan gods. Therefore the references made to them as gods to be honoured, and the sacrifices directed to be offered to them in the Brahmanas are offerings to non-Aryan gods who were worshipped before the guardianship of the rituals was assigned to Aryan priests. It will, therefore, be seen at once that there are recognized as great gods in the Brahmanas other and older gods than those who were worshipped by the Aryans. I have further, in dealing with the general history of India, shown that the Aryans made their way to supreme power chiefly by their diplomatic and political ability, by their readiness of resource, the religious reverence inspired by their missionaries and the best of their priests, and by alliances and marriages with the ruling races, and they 1 Alteration, even when initiated by Aryan or northern races, who were always Protestants and reformers, was always made in fear and trembling, and, as will be shown in the sequel, the greatest care was taken in these alterations to avoid showing disrespect to the older gods. 2 Sat.

The other races who preceded the Aryans seem to have in almost all cases amalgamated with the people without destroying or subverting their institutions. In the history of invasions and conquests made by new tribes in other countries in early times, it appears that the first object of the conquerors was to propitiate the gods of their new territory, and they used to worship them instead of treating them with contempt. For this purpose they were obliged to inquire carefully into the details of the religious ceremonies with which the gods were approached, and to enlist the services of the priests. Consequently the establishment of the power of a new tribe only meant an addition to the previous rites, for those to the old gods were continued as before, while sacrifices to the gods of the new rulers were added to the ritual.1 In order to understand fully the reasons which necessitated this method of procedure the strength of the feeling of vener ation for accepted religious observances must be thoroughly appreciated, and we must fully understand how great was the difference between the ancient and the modern spirit. The minds of the earliest races of mankind were saturated with the fear of the unknown, and it was this which was the first incentive to sacrifice. The savage who tried to propitiate the unknown being, to whose agency he attributed any calamity from which he suffered, was always inclined to repeat the use of means which he thought had been once efficacious in averting the wrath of the hidden powers whom he feared. But this repetition to be effective must necessarily be exact, and hence a scrupulous attention to details became at a very early period an indispensable condition attaching to religious ceremonies.2 When these ceremonies became, as 1 See with reference to these remarks the narrative given later on showing how the Acchavaka, the priests of the moon-god, were taken on as assistants in the Soma sacrifice of the Indra worshippers. 2 See with reference to the immense importance attached to minute exactness in similar cases Maine's Ancient Law, p. 276, where he says : " An ancient con veyance was not written but acted. Gestures and looks took the place of written technical phraseology. Any formula mispronounced or symbolical act omitted would have vitiated the proceedings as fatally as a material mistake in stating</page><page sequence="6">324 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. they very soon did, public functions, ritualistic correctness was still more strongly insisted on. Sacrifices offered for the tribe became important matters of state, and though when the fire-worshippers introduced the domestic sacrifices to the gods of the household fire, an additional class of private sacrifices was added to those which were all previously public and official, this addition did not detract from the great importance which still continued to be attached to tribal and territorial sacrifices. The yield of the crops, the in crease and well-being of the tribe, and of their herds and flocks, success in foreign wars, and the safety of the people from intestine disturbances, pestilences and famines, were all held to depend on the due performance of religious rites. Consequently, from the earliest institution of these cere monies it was thought to be absolutely necessary that no mistakes should be made in their performance, and the rules prescribed for each rite must have been handed down from generation to generation as the most precious of national possessions. Ceremonies thus sanctioned increased in number in pro gressive states as new tribes came into power and brought in new tribal gods. These gods were, as I shall show in the course of this essay, increased at a very early period by metaphysical speculation, and additions of this kind were in India made ages before any of the hymns of the Rigveda were written. But these were not the only additions. I have already shown the very early changes made by cal culations as to the succession of time and the influence of the moon as its measurer. By this, which was the earliest form of scientific research outside those undertaken for purposes of immediate utility, the gods of time were added to the gods of generation and the local deities. But the worship of these new gods did not abrogate the ceremonies due to their predecessors. These continued to be offered the uses or setting out the remainders would two hundred years ago have vitiated an English deed." The king in laying down the law was supposed to be speaking by divine inspiration, and strict attention to details in carrying out a law hallowed by divine sanction was derived from the same feeling as that which made ritualistic exactness necessary.</page><page sequence="7">CONSERVATISM OF ANCIENT GOVERNMENTS. 325 even by the Aryan priesthood, and though the Indra wor shippers and their Aryan successors, who were much bolder innovators than the older priests, somewhat altered the form of the sacrifices, and though they also introduced the great change from tribal to family life,1 yet they did not dare to ignore the old gods. Even among nations who were strongly imbued with Aryan ideas the tendency to the strictest conservatism in the maintenance of their revised ritual continued to predominate over the innovating spirit. 3 hey and others who introduced changes and additions con tinued to be no less afraid of the old gods than the most conservative of their predecessors. Though these gods were less powerful than those of the conquering and superior race, they must still receive their wonted dues, otherwise they would be angry and might do mischief. Hence the religious ceremonies which had once been accepted by the older priesthood were also regarded by their successors as no less hallowed than they had been thought to be by those who originally consecrated them, and the fear of the anger of the older gods always remained in early civilization as the most potent factor in promoting religious continuity. Futhermore, as religious ceremonies were among the most important political institutions, and Church and State were really the whole community looked at from different points of view, the feeling of reverence and awe made the very strong conservative element in ancient governments still more strong, and retained tribes which had once been separate units as component parts of a nation bound together by the worship of the same gods. It therefore appears that this seemingly excessive vener ation for what looks to us to be trivial and unmeaning ceremonies was really a necessary conclusion from the premisses accepted by these early reasoners. Its intensity and great importance in explaining primaeval history is well illustrated by the following remarks of Mommsen on the 1 Introduced probably by the sons of Kus, called in India the Kusikas, who came into India from the Kabul valley, and who calculated the full lunar year of thirteen months. vol. xxii.?[new series.] 22</page><page sequence="8">326 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. political power of the Roman priesthood. In the first place he notices the fear of the gods expressed in the idea that the ceremonies due to each were a debt, the payment of which would be rigorously exacted by the gods who would be defrauded by its non-performance. " The gods," he says, "confronted man just as a creditor confronted the debtor, each of them had a duly acquired right to certain perform ances and payments."1 This, though tempered by Roman ideas of the majesty of law, is the same idea as is expressed in what is perhaps its original form in the Hindu Brahmanas, where the sacrifice is treated as a debt by the payment of which the sacrificer redeems himself from the gods.2 It appears also in the Jewish consecration of the first-born to God.3 As to the increasingly exacting attention paid to details by the later priests Dr. Mommsen says: " The later priests pushed the natural rule that no religious service can be acceptable to the gods unless performed without flaw to such an extent in practice that sacrifices had to be repeated ' thirty times in succession on account of the mistakes again and again committed, and that the games which also formed part of divine service were regarded as undone if the pre siding magistrate had committed any slip in word or deed, or if the music had paused at the wrong time, and so had to be begun again afresh, frequently for several, even so many as seven times in succession."4 Veneration for details such as is here depicted will be found to be an invariable accompaniment of every ritualistic system, and in the course of this essay I shall bring forward ample evidence to prove the historical importance of some of the smallest minutiae insisted on in the Brahmanas. Each of them had a special meaning, and in judging of their relative importance in the Hindu system we have the great advantage that we are not dependent upon one treatise, but can compare a number of different manuals issued by 1 Mommsen, History of Rome, translated by W. P. Dickson, vol. i. p. 181. 2 Sat. Brah. i. 2. 3. 5. vol. xii. p. 49, note 3. 3 Ex xiii. 11-14. 4 Mommsen, History of Rome, translated by W. P. Dickson, People's Edition, vol. ii. p. 400.</page><page sequence="9">EVIDENCE OF THE ANTIQUITY OF RITUALISM. 327 different and independent schools. Consequently what is accepted by all the schools as correct must be regarded as a completely recognized and sanctioned dogma. But a further question as to the historical value of these Brahmanas arises when we consider what evidence they give as to the time when ritualism began. Though it may be pre-Aryan, it may not extend so very far back in the remote past. But this conclusion cannot be admitted, for I hope to prove most conclusively the very great antiquity of the earliest ritualistic customs recorded in these treatises. I hope to show that a complete ritualistic code of forms and ceremonies existed ages before the Rigveda was thought of or sacrificial hymns were chanted by the priests, and that the rites prescribed by these old traditional, but carefully preserved, codes are found in the Brahmanas in forms which it is true have been altered, but in which the old spirit is still preserved. One proof of this is to be found in the rules for animal sacrifices. These are pre-Aryan, and in most of the sacrifices authorized in the Brahmanas rice and barley cakes are confessedly substituted for the animal offering, but in the great Soma-sacrifice the animal offering was still continued. In the rules for this offering in the Satapatha Brahmana it is ordered that the animal should be strangled, " and not struck on the frontal bone after the manner of men/' or stabbed behind the ear " after the manner of the fathers." x The sacrifice by strangling is, as will be shown later on, a Scythian custom, but the passage further shows that before the Scythians, or Sakas, altered the ritual by strangling the victim, there were two previous ways of killing it, each of which was apparently sanctioned by previous ritualistic rules. Of these two discarded practices the first must have grown to be recognized as orthodox, and the substitution of the second for the earliest method betokens a religious revolution accompanying a change in the ruling race, and these second rulers were in their turn evicted by the Scythian invaders. 1 Sat. Brah. iii. 8. 1. 15. vol. xxvi. p. 190.</page><page sequence="10">328 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. I shall show in the sequel that this last invasion must have taken place long before the Rigveda began to be written, while the more ancient method of stabbing the animal behind the ear was that of the Fathers, who are called in the Brahmanas the Pitarah Somavantah, and who were snake and moon worshippers. I do not believe that any scholars will refuse to admit that the Rigveda itself is a ritualistic work, and that these hymns could not have been composed and preserved except among a people by whom a carefully arranged ritual had been used for ages as the ruling form of all religious ceremonies. I hope to be able to prove by actual examples that the new changes which were made after much deliberation by conquerors and new-comers did not obliterate the old forms, but that the gods of the old religions were preserved, some as subordinate to, and others as equal with the new. In the successive revolutions caused by the introduction, first of fire-worship, and secondly of the worship of Indra, which degraded the snake-gods to a subordinate place among the official deities, and in the still greater revolutions caused by the introduction of sun worship and the solar reckoning of time, and by the sancti fication of the household fire, the continuity of the worship of the great mother earth, the male father of all beings, and the moon-god, the heavenly ruler of the triad, who were the supreme gods before all these successive innovations began, was still preserved. Evidence of the great Antiquity of Sacrificial Forms. But what gives still more important, and what seems to me to be irrefragable evidence of the great antiquity of Hindu sacrificial forms is the calendar on which they are based. No scholar who has studied the subject can refuse to admit with Max Muller that the division of the heavens into equal sections called Nakshatras, which mark the passage of the moon in her monthly courses, is at the root of these sacred calendars, and that without these lunar months none of the sacrifices enjoined in the Brahmanas could be carried</page><page sequence="11">HISTORY OF THE YEAR. 329 out.1 But these Nakshatras appear in the Brahmanas as part of a scheme for reconciling by the use of a cycle of five years the lunar, solar and sidereal years, and in this cycle they are reckoned as twenty-seven in number.2 They appear there as phases of the moon, and the mention in the Rigveda (i. 133. 6) of the Nakshatras, under the name of Maruts, as twenty-seven in number, proves that this cycle was known to the Yedic poets. But before these Nakshatras were used as component parts of the lunar year they were twenty-eight in number, and they then represented the days of the lunar month. In a passage quoted by Max Miiller3 from a Hindu astronomer who records the opinions of Madhava it is said that " The Nakshatra month consists of the passage of the moon through all the Nakshatras," and this opinion he shows is that accepted by Patanjali and Garga, two other ancient astronomers. From this it appears that the Nak shatra days on which the sacrifices were based represented the days of the lunar month. It will be shown further on that the primitive year consisted of lunar months and five seasons. But this early year was that used before the ten lunar months representing the period of gestation had been considered sacred, and this division of time, which was by the Romans called an " annus," or year, preceded the full lunar year of thirteen months. The year of five seasons also preceded those based upon the six seasons, which the Brahmanas tell us were used by the Pitarah Somavantah, the moon and snake worshippers, and before the Aryan year of three seasons, which is that which is best known to the authors of the Rigveda, and which is represented in the Vaisvadeva, Varunapraghasah, and the Sakamedhah sacrifices, which, are the three annual seasonal sacrifices of the Brahmanas as distinguished from the sacrifices to the five seasons made at the new and full moon festivals. When it is recollected that all these methods of reckoning time preceded the use of the 1 Max Miiller, preface to vol. iv. of his edition of the Rigveda, p. 38. 2 See with reference to the mode of reckoning, and history of the ancient year, the Appendix to this essay, where the whole question is fully discussed. 3 lb. p. 58.</page><page sequence="12">330 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. solar year, which dates from about 4700 B.C.,. the lapse of time indicated by these successive changes appears almost bewildering, and yet the sacrificial ritual extends back to a time before the very earliest of these periods. No attempt to make any approximate estimate of the length of time denoted by these changes, which does not realize the strength of ancient conservatism, can be in the least degree successful, as the ceremonies originally pre scribed for the performance of any sacrifice were its most important part: any change in the rites could only have resulted from a great social revolution which it must have taken ages to accomplish. Throughout a country so immense as India changes wrere made very slowly, and successive changes such as those which I have already noticed, to which other instances will be added in the sequel, indicate great lapses of time, and these were probably exceeded by the length of time during which the older ceremonies, re moved into the back-ground by successive innovations, were held to be so orthodox as to be of the first importance. In the eyes of the ancient ritualists an imperfectly performed and maimed sacrifice was if possible a greater insult to the deity to whom it was offered than its entire omission, and therefore only an extraordinary and unusual concurrence of circumstances, operating through long periods of time, could justify or secure the permanent acceptance of a change. List of Subjects to be Discussed. Throughout this essay I shall therefore show that the continuity of the sacrifices, of which I shall give ample evidence, proves both the very great antiquity of religious ceremonies and the very long periods through which India must have been ruled by the races who observed them, and who insisted on their observance throughout the length and breadth of the land. I shall further show that a careful study of the Brahmanas discloses historical results which in the main coincide with those obtained by me from other data.</page><page sequence="13">ORIGIN OF RITUALISM OF ASIA AND EUROPE. 331 But what will be more generally interesting, and more valuable to readers who have not studied Indian history, will be what appears to me at least to be satisfactory proof that the evolution of religious thought in India, which I shall trace out in the sacrifices, agreed exactly, step for step, with that which can be shown to have taken place in other mythologies and theologies of Western Asia and Europe. This accumulative proof will add great force to the argu ments I have already brought forward to prove that Indian, Asiatic, Egyptian, and European civilization all originated in the Euphrates valley ; that it was the Suraero-Akkadian races, for the most part of Dravidian origin, living in that country, who laid the foundations of stable government, and added the most practically valuable parts of the superstruc ture ; and that this same people originated both materialistic theology and the study of astronomy, undertaken with the object of regulating the proper times for the official sacrifices. I shall also bring forward further evidence to show the part played by the Aryans and other races who entered India after Dravidian rule had been consolidated, and shall prove how in theology they first spiritualized the former materialistic conceptions, and afterwards made ethics, in cluding a love of goodness for its own sake, as well as exterior morality a part of religion, though this most im portant branch of the subject can only be cursorily referred to from want of space. In the more strictly historical parts of this essay I shall show reason to believe that there were two very early Dravidian immigrations into India, the first being that of the worshippers of the great mother earth and the moon goddess, and that these first immigrants were followed after a long lapse of time by the snake-worshippers. These combined tribes governed for a very long time the country which had been first organized under the control of the mother-worshippers, and divided the whole of the continent, from Cape Comorin on the south to the Himalayas in the north, into kingdoms which wrere for the most part governed according to a system based on Dravidian rules adapted to</page><page sequence="14">332 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. a substructure of Kolarian land tenures. Their rule was superseded in the north perhaps by that of the fire worshippers,1 who were certainly the first recorded invaders from the north, who were called the Kusika, or the sons of Kus. They were succeeded by the horse-taming and horse worshipping Sakas, or Scythians, the worshippers of Indra, who were amalgamated with the Kusikas, but it was they who changed the worship of Indra, the god of the fertilizing waters, who was adored by the northern agricultural tribes who came down with or in the wake of the fire-worshippers, into the god Sukra, or Sakko, the warrior god of the Scythian races. They again were succeeded in the west by the Semite Akkadian races, the Sauvira, and the cattle-herding and cow worshipping Sakas, who introduced sun-worship and the solar year, and founded the numerous kingdoms ruled by the Ikshvaku race, of which the principal was that which had its capital at Saketa in Ayodhya. Before beginning to show how the evidence to be gathered from the Brahmanas leads up to these conclusions, it will be desirable to set forth fully the origin and early significance of sacrifices, as a clear understanding of this part of the subject will help greatly in solving many of the problems which must be confronted in the course of the inquiry. Early Meaning of Sacrifices. In treatises on sacrifices they are usually divided into two classes, (1) Honorific, which consist of gifts given to secure the favour of the god or gods to whom they are offered, and (2) Piacular, or propitiatory offerings given to deprecate their anger. 1 It seems to be doubtful whether the fire-worshippers actually conquered the moon-worshippers. The evidence seems rather to point to a joint government like that of the Northern and Southern Akkadians in the Euphrates valley. The fire-worshippers were apparently the race who introduced the year of thirteen lunar months into India, and who were in the Euphratean country the Northern Akkadian worshippers of the Akkadian deity called by the Semites Adar, who was the original fire-god. They were in India called the sons of Kasyapa, and he is in the Zendavesta called Keresaspa, and his kingdom is represented as being in the land of Kabul, to the north-west of India. See Appendix.</page><page sequence="15">EARLY MEANING OF SACRIFICES. 333 But this division seems to me to be quite incomplete, as it excludes the earliest class of sacrifices, which is the most important of all to the historian, that in which the sacrifice is given as food to the god to whom it is offered. In considering the subject it must be remembered that the earliest gods of all nations were probably local and totemistic deities. The local gods were probably the first gods of the forest agricultural tribes, and the totemistic gods seem to have been first worshipped among the pastoral or nomad races. Of these two tribes it seems that the forest tribes were the first to begin agriculture, and that they were joined later on by the pastoral tribes, who had emerged from the hunting stage to that of tending cattle. The forest tribes, who were the first agriculturists, probably, like the forest tribes of India at the present day, began by clearing patches of forest land, which they tilled by hand labour and occupied for about two seasons till the soil was exhausted. The trees they cleared away by burning. But the use of iron for cutting purposes began exceedingly early in India, and perhaps preceded that of bronze in other countries. Their agricultural implements were probably made of wood, like those recently exhumed at Kahun in Egypt, which date from the Twelfth Dynasty, or about 2600 B.C.1 All the hoes, rakes and sickles found there are made of wood, and are precisely of the same form as the iron implements still used throughout the East. But with these wooden tools bronze knives and axes were also found, which were used to cut the wood, while the saws and hunting implements are made of flint. 1 Among the workmen's appliances were two cubit measures, which I measured roughly, one somewhat over 26 inches, and the other about 18 inches. The larger cubit was divided into seven parts or palms, and the smaller into six. Both were apparently of foreign origin, the smaller cubit being about the length of the cubit of Asia Minor, 17*30, and the larger of the Persian cubit, 25*34. The work men did not seem to use the cubit of 20-63, which is that of the early pyramid builders. If the workmen employed were foreigners, they probably came by sea from Asia Minor. These, of course, represent a state of society which existed in the Euphrates valley, India and Egypt many thousands of years before the date at which these deposits were accumulated.</page><page sequence="16">334 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. The Gods of the Forest Tribes were Local Deities. The savage, even in the nomad, and much more in the half settled stage which marked the beginnings of agriculture, must have been continually oppressed with an abiding sense of the harm wrought by natural phenomena. These appeared to him to be the work of being3 like but more powerful than himself, and more especially to be dreaded as invisible and intangible. When he had to repair the damages and guard against the dangers caused by floods, storms, lightnings, disease and accidents, his natural impulse was to ascribe the calamities, which destroyed the fruit of his labour, disturbed his peace and damaged his prospects of success, to beings who, though invisible, lived on the spot. He was naturally angry with his unknown enemies, but at the same time he feared their power and was anxious to have them on his side instead of against him. Hence arose the idea of keeping them in good humour, and the best way of doing this seemed to be to feed them. It was therefore because the first sacrifices were given as food that sacrifices came to be considered the food of the gods, as they are said to be in the most ancient sacrificial manuals.1 The Gods of the Pastoral Tribes were Totemistic. When the first agricultural tribes were united with the pastoral cattle-herdsmen and ploughing was introduced, a new era arose. The new-comers brought with them a new class of gods. They were not oppressed with the same dread of local influences as troubled the forest races. Though they feared drought, and therefore sought countries watered by rivers, what they principally wanted was not deliverance from floods and storms, but increase of numbers to defend 1 Sat. Brah. i. 1. 1.8 and 9, vol. xii. p. 5, and many other places. The same idea appears in the Bible, Levit. xxi. 17 and 22, where the sacrifice is called the bread of God, and also in Levit. iii. 11, where the peace-offering is called "the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord."</page><page sequence="17">GODS OF PASTORAL TRIBES TOTEMISTIC. 335 themselves from their enemies, and of cattle to provide for the growing population. The phenomena therefore which peculiarly impressed their minds were those of generation, and it was the unknown producers of the first living beings whom they regarded as gods. These became the gods of totemism, who were the reputed ancestors of the tribes by whom they were wor shipped. They were the special tribal gods who, as is shown by Dr. Sayce in his account of the religion of the Akkadians, were regarded as "Dingirs," or Creators.1 These gods, who were the products of a higher faith than those which were conceived by the fear of the forest savages, became the principal gods of the united tribes, while the local gods, except those adopted as ancestors, such as the rivers,2 were relegated to a lower sphere. It was a necessary condition of the prosperity of nomad, and afterwards of settled pastoral tribes, that they should be so numerous as to be able to defend their settlements, whether permanent or temporary, from other nomads in search of pasturage or places of fixed abode. For in open countries such as those in which they lived numbers furnished the only sufficient means of defence before walled fortresses were made.3 Therefore the addition of new members to the tribe was one of the first duties of creative ancestors. Hence the idea of duty was attached to the divine nature, and the gods were no longer regarded as merely capricious beings who must be kept in good humour by their votaries. I have already in this series of papers shown that a strong sense of duty was always present to the Dravidian mind. It 1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 43. 2 Thus Sarasvati, Ida, and Main are river goddesses and ancestors in the Rig veda, and " Tiber, father Tiber to whom the Romans pray," is another well known instance of the deification of rivers. But rivers were first deified by the worshippers of the snake-god, who was the god called Hea by the Akkadians, and became in India Indra, the god of the sanctifying waters. a This increasing population required to be maintained, and the necessity of providing for their maintenance was one of the great stimulants to progress. It was thus that the early customs of infanticide, abortion, and sterilizing males, stated in the Zendavesta to be hateful to Ashi Vanguhi, the goddess who was patron of married women, were discontinued. Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Ashi Yast x. 54-59, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiii. pp. 280-281. The whole question is further discussed later on in this essay.</page><page sequence="18">336 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. was to them what honour is to the Aryans. Every member of the body politic had to do his or her allotted part towards the maintenance of the prosperity of the tribe or state, and the gods, as ancestors or creators, were thought to be equally bound with their descendants by the obligations they had incurred by creating the tribe. It was their duty and especial task to aid mankind in carrying out the precept to " increase and multiply/' which was apparently the first command recognized as divine. It was by the aid of the tribal god that the tribe grew in numbers and their flocks and herds increased, and it was by the power exercised by the same god over the local deities that the fields of the united pastoral agriculturists produced the crops necessary to maintain the growing population and to feed the cattle when grass failed. But the gods who had to perform these tasks required to be fed no less than those who were to be kept in good humour, for without food they could not have the strength to do their duty, and hence sacrifices continued to be offered to them as to the local gods as food. We thus find that sacrifices were looked on as food for two reasons, one that they kept the local gods in good humour, and the other that they strengthened and nourished the tribal gods who were bound to provide for the prosperity of the tribe. But this last of the two ways in which sacrifice was held to be food opened out a third view. It was thought that as the sacrificial food was an addition to the strength of the gods, that this food was therefore one of the factors in the production of new generations, and hence arose the belief that the sacrifice was a productive union of earthly and divine elements for the generation of offspring. This idea is continually set forth in the Brahmanas.1 1 Sat. Brah. i. 1. 1. 18, vol. xii. p. 9, and many other places. See especially Aitareya Brahmana iv. 2 and 3, Haug's translation, p. 327, note, for the description of the manner in which the Ajya (Goat) Shastra, Rig. iii. 13, should be recited, also the Pravargya and Gharma ceremonies, Ait. Brah. i. 4. 18 and 22, Haug's translation, vol. ii. pp. 48-51. These are said to represent the cohabitation of the gods, and the production from the womb of Agni (the sacred fire) of a new and purer race of gods than the old lunar deities of the A suras, or snake-worshippers.</page><page sequence="19">NEW AND FULL MOON SACRIFICES. 337 In the description of certain selected sacrifices enjoined in the Brahmanas which I am now about to undertake, it will be seen that religious ideas had, when these sacrifices were instituted, made a great advance from the crude materialism I have just described, and that the chief gods to whom the official sacrifices were offered were not the tribal fathers or ancestors, but the one mother and father of all things, and the god of time, who rules the seasons and measures the year. But the following analysis of the new and full moon sacrifices, which are among the oldest in the official cata logue, will show that these sacrifices were still considered the food of the gods, and that they were thought to be pro ductive unions of pairs of sources of creative force, and similar results will be obtained by analyzing almost all the greater sacrifices in the Brahmanas. It will also be seen that these sacrifices are based on a year of five seasons, and they therefore trace back their origin to an era before time was reckoned by the full lunar year of thirteen months and by six seasons, and they must also be infinitely earlier as far as India is concerned than the Aryan year of three seasons. New and Full Moon Sacrifices. The new and full moon sacrifices, each of which are offered once in each lunar month, are preceded by five fore-offerings (Prayagas). They are invitations asking the five deities who are invoked in the first four and the last verses of the AprI hymns of the Rigveda to attend the sacrifice. These Apr! hymns are recited at the animal sacrifices, and the gods invited are (1) the Samidhs or kindling-sticks, (2) Tanunapat or Narasamsa, (3) Idah, (4) the Barhis, or sacrificial grass spread on the altar, and (5) the god called by the cry Svaha.1 All these passages set forth the doctrine of the sacrifice as a reproductive agent in its crudest and most materialistic form. 1 Aitareya Brah. ii. 1. 4, Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 87 ; Sat. Brah. i. 5. 3. 9-13, vol. xii. pp. 146, 148. For the meaning of the god of the Svaha call, which is addressed to Agni Svishtakrit, see Sat. Brah. i. 7. 3. 1-9, vol. xii. pp. 199-202, where it is shown that it was Rudra the phallic god who was thus summoned.</page><page sequence="20">338 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. These five gods are said to represent the five seasons,1 but it is necessary to look further so as to see the full meaning of each member of the group, and the full significance of the number five. (1) The Samidhs or kindling-sticks. The Spring. These, the first in order of the five gods, are said to represent the spring. They are to be used in lighting the sacrificial fire, and are ordered to be applied to light the three enclosing sticks (paridhi) placed in a triangle round the firewood.2 These enclosing sticks are explained to be the three former Agnis (fire-gods), who were struck down by the thunderbolt of Indra.3 They are (1) the Lord of the earth, (2) the Lord of the universe, and (3) the Lord of living beings,4 or the old triad of the mother earth, the phallic god, the father, and the vital power animating both. They are kindled by the two Samidhs, which are the Svastika, or fire-sticks, which, when rubbed together, produce the flame. They are said to represent the heavenly and the earthly fire. With the first the priest kindles the middle enclosing stick at the base of the triangle, which represents the vital and creative power which animates both the mother earth and the universal father and binds them together. He then kindles with it the fire materials which the triangle encloses.5 He thus kindles the three former supreme gods and the sacred central fire, the emblem of the divine power of the latent heat, the creative force of which was greater than that of the old gods. With the second Samidh, or the earthly fire, which he puts on the burning firewood, he kindles the spring, and with it the whole productive year.6 The functions of the Samidhs, which I have expressed in terms taken from the Satapatha Brahmana, clearly represent the vivifying power of heat, which kindles into life the old generating gods of the 1 Sat.

It is not from earthly food that they receive their strength, as in the old materialistic religion, but from the quickening power of the sacred flame. In other words, the Samidhs are the productive pair which represent the union of heaven and earth under heavenly influences, and the summons to the Samidhs to partake of the sacrificial feast and to bless the sacrifice, is said to be a victory of the gods over the Asuras, to whom the seasons formerly belonged.1 This means that the life-giving power which was formerly ascribed to the old lunar and anthropomorphic gods of the Asuras was, under the more spiritualistic religion of the fire worshippers, transferred to the divine heat, while the in clusion of the three former Agnis shows that they who were the gods of the Dravidian Akkadians, or of the people called in the Mahabharata Virata, worshippers of the phallus or snake, and of the votaries of the moon and mother earth, were still included in the sacrifice in which the fire-god took the first place.2 In this sacrifice, as I shall show when proving that the first three gods represent the triad consisting of heaven and earth as the productive, and the moon-god as the creative power, the Samidhs represent the heaven, which takes the place of the phallic god, the father of all things, in the earlier triad. When associated with Agni the fire-god, the phallic father takes a subordinate place among the three Agnis, but he is also directly summoned, as I shall show later on, as Rudra, the god who is said to have been at first excluded from the sacrifice, but afterwards admitted to a chief place.

In considering who was the actual deity represented under this mystical name it must be remembered that these five seasonal gods were addressed in the Apr! hymns of the Rigveda which were recited at the animal sacrifice.1 These were essentially non-Aryan sacrifices, and among other proofs of this may be cited the fact that while the fire to be used in the sacrifice is being carried round, the priest recites the first three verses of the hymn Rig. iv. 15, in which the fire is said to be that of the Srnjaya chief, Devavata's son.2 I have shown further that this probably is the Srnjaya chief who is said in the Satapatha Brahmana to have been made into an Aryan by the ceremony of initiation.3 Therefore not only was the sacrifice unhallowed according to Aryan ideas, but the fire that took the sweet savour of the sacrifice up to heaven was not the sacred fire of the Aryans, but the less pure fire of the Asuras. Consequently none of the gods invoked in this sacrifice were originally pure Aryan gods. In the stanzas of the Apr! hymns addressed to Tanunapat he is sometimes called Narasamsa (beloved of men). In two hymns, Rig. i. 13. 2 and 3, and i. 142. 2 and 3, both Tanunapat and Narasamsa are each summoned in a separate stanza as if they were different deities, and in the last of these two hymns, in v. 4, Indra is called among the Agnis or fire-gods, so that there are in Rig. i. 13 twelve, and in i. 142 thirteen stanzas instead of eleven, the proper number for an Apr! hymn. All the other AprI hymns have only eleven stanzas, and in these the god invoked in Rig. i. 188. 2, iii. 4. 2, ix. 5. 2, and x. 110. 2, is Tanunapat, while in Rig. ii. 3. 2, v. 5. 2, vii. 2. 2, and x. 70. 2 it is Narasamsa. Among these Rig. ii. 3. 2 and ix. 5. 2 are the most note worthy. In the first Narasamsa is addressed as the god who adorns all places and casts his light through the three heavens. The god here addressed seems to be the moon 1 Ait. Brah. ii. 1. 4, Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 81. 2 lb. ii. 1. 5, p. 84. 3 Part II. J.R.A.S. April, 1889, pp. 309 and 329.</page><page sequence="23">TANTJNAPAT, THE MOON-GOD. 341 god, who shines, unlike the sun, both in the day and in the night, but this stanza has a further mystical meaning, and seems to speak of the moon-god as the impulse (muni) which gives life to the three heavens, the earth, the air, and the sky.1 This meaning is clearly proved by the last two lines of the stanza, which represent him as sprinkling the life giving fat over the offering and the gods. This fat is ex plained in the Brahmanas to be like the sacrificial butter, the divine sap which binds heaven and earth together, and gives life to all things.2 The fat or butter is, as I shall show later on, only offered to the Asura gods, and therefore Narasamsa, the god invoked in this stanza, must belong to the old triad. In Rig. ix. 5. 2, where Tanunapat is called "the rippling one who flies through the wide heavens wetting his horns," it seems to be impossible not to think that it is the moon god who is invoked. In this hymn the god summoned as Tanunapat cannot possibly be the sun-god, as in stanza 11 of the same hymn the sun-god is named as summoned by Agni with those called last to the sacrifice. He could not be called twice, once as a follower of Agni, when he had been before called as an independent god, nor could the horns which are wetted be those of the fire-stick, which is repre sented as a trident, the centre prong being the fire-stick, as it does not fly through the wide heavens. The god invoked must therefore be the moon-god, but not the moon-god of the phallus-worshippers, but the purified moon-god of the Indra-worshippers. Indra is derived from Indu (drop, sap), and means the god of the life-giving waters who guards the Amrita, or waters of immortality. This will be fully ex plained later on when I come to speak of the myth of Manu. To the writer of this hymn it seemed that the moon-god 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 5. 1. 10, vol. xii. p. 386, where Savitri the sun-god is called the impeller, i.e. the impulse of the gods. This was the part assigned to the moon-god in the early lunar triad. 2 Sat. Brah. i. 5. 3. 16, and ii. 4. 3. 10, vol. xii. pp. 149 and 372. In this metaphor creation is regarded as a tree whose top is in heaven and whose roots are in earth, and it is the sap which connects them together. It is the same meta phor as that embodied in the sacred Yggdrasil, the world tree of the northern Eddas. vol. xxii.?[new sekies.] 23</page><page sequence="24">342 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. derived his power from wetting his horns in the Amrita or creative waters of heaven, and it was the god who was thus invested with creative force whom he summoned. It is hardly necessary to consider which of these two terms for the creative and self-creating spirit is the oldest. But to judge from the meaning, Tanunapat, the self-created one, is the more mystical and abstract, and therefore probably the newer term. Narasamsa (beloved of men) would seem to have been used as an epithet of the moon-god before the crowding metaphysical conceptions of an age of active theo logical thought had rendered the adoption of a more compre hensive name for the supreme deity necessary. Both seem to have meant the moon-god as the visible representation of life-giving energy and the uniting bond both of the earlier and later creative triad. That Narasamsa represented the older gods who were relegated to a lower sphere when the fire-god, Indra, and the sun-god successively became the chief of the gods, is shown by the way in which he is spoken of in the ritual for the Anuyaja or after-offerings. These succeed the chief oblations, as the Prayajas or fore-offerings preceded them.1 They are made to three gods, (1) the Barhis or sacred grass covering the altar, which is said to represent the earth and the plants on it, (2) Narasamsa, the air, and (3) Agni. This is evidently another form of the triad (1) earth, (2) the moon-god, who was subsequently displaced by Indra, the god of the atmospheric region, the Hea, or water snake god of the Akkadians, and (3) the god of the fire-stick, who, to the fire-worshippers, took the place of the phallic god, the materialistic father of all beings. But in a sub sequent paragraph they are declared not to be gods,2 that is to say, they were, as I have shown, the gods of an older theology. I have shown in Part II.3 of this series of essays that the chief god of the summer solstice, who is called to come to this sacrifice as Narasamsa, is the moon-god, and 1 Sat. Brah. i. 8. 2. 10-13, vol. xii. pp. 233, 234. 2 Sat. Brah. i. 8. 2. 15, vol. xii. p. 235. 3 j.R.A.S. April, 1889, p. 322.</page><page sequence="25">IDA THE MOTHER OF MANKIND. 343 there can therefore, it seems to me, be no doubt that the god typified in Narasamsa and Tanunapat is the vital energy of which the moon-god was held to be the visible sign and type in the two earlier triads. The first consisting of (1) the All-father, the phallic god, (2) the moon-god, and (3) the earth, and the second in which the heaven took the place of the All-father. But by the time these hymns were written the central power had been ascribed not only to the moon god, but also to the god of latent heat and the god of the water of life, and it was because it had been traced to these different sources that the Vedic poets called it by the name Tanunapat, the self-created, which expressed the inner meaning which underlay all the visible signs of this great and mysterious power. It will be shown later on, when I come to speak of the Vaisvadeva sacrifice, that there is a further and most in teresting question as to the nature of the moon-god to be discussed, as to whether it was male or female. I shall show that it most probably originally represented the feminine power which gave life to the mother earth and her offspring. (3) Idah. The Rains. The next deity summoned is said to represent the rainy season. It is said to have been taken by the gods from their rivals and predecessors the Asuras. The word Idah here used is the plural of Ida, the name of the universal mother said to have been formed by Manu (meaning the thinker) out of the waters which were impreg nated with the heavenly seed.1 In the mythic story in the Satapatha Brahmana Manu, the thinker, when he found him self alone in the world, after all the rest of mankind had been drowned in the flood, threw into the waters clarified butter (ghee), sour milk, whey and curds, and from the water in which this seed was sown Ida, the universal mother, arose after a year. This clarified butter is the offering made to the butter-drinking gods, who are described in the Sata patha Brahmana as the older gods, to whom the fore-offerings (prayajas) were given.2 They are said in another place to be 1 Sat. Brah. i. 8. 1. 7-9, vol. xii. pp. 218-219. 2 Sat. Brah. i. 5. 3. 23, vol. xii. p. 151.</page><page sequence="26">344 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. the heaven and earth, the butter being the sap that makes them fruitful.1 Sour and sweet milk, whey and curds, are the ingredients of the Sannaya sacrifice, which is that specially offered to Indra,2 the god of the fertilizing waters and storms, who by his thunderbolt overthrew the three former Agnis.3 According to this myth Ida, the mother earth, is not the divine mother of the phallic worshippers, who is called in Brahmanas and the Mahabharata Kadru, the mother of snakes,4 but the purified earth which has been cleansed by the sanctifying waters and raised again to be the home of a new and more holy race who worshipped the spiritual gods, and not the sensual materialistic deities of an earlier time. The whole story of the flood is thus seen to be another form of the Indra myth, showing how the snake-wor shippers and their creed were destroyed by Indra.5 It was therefore clearly conceived after Indra became the chief god, but it probably originated in Assyria, where Hea, the fish god and water snake, who, according to the Chaldaean Genesis, and the story in the Mahabharata, ordered the building of the ark,6 was the god who determined on the destruction of the wicked race of snake-worshippers. He is the horned fish which in the story in the Satapatha Brahmana drags the ark to the mountains, and the horns connect him with the gazelle sacred to Mul-lil, the Akkadian god of storms, who was originally the lord (mul) of the dust (lil), that is, the husband of the earth, the phallic father or great snake. He afterwards became the god Hea, who in his later form was the counterpart of the Hindu Indra, the 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 4. 3. 8-10, vol. xii. p. 372. 2 Sat. Brah. i. 6. 4. 8-9, vol. xii. p. 177. 3 Sat.

Brah. iii. 6. 2. 2, vol. xxvi. p. 149; Mahabharata, Adi Parva, xx.-xxiii. 5 This is expressed in a somewhat different form with the same meaning in a quotation made by Dr. Sayce from an Akkadian mythological document which says : " The heaven was made from the waters. The god and goddess create the earth." According to this cosmogony the waters were the mother of all things. Afterwards water became the father.

Here the god is the sacred fish nurtured by Manu (the thinker), showing that the fish-god was a conception worked out by thought. The Mahabharata fish-god only warned Manu of the destruction coming, and advised him to build a large ark furnished with a rope, in which Manu and the seven Rishis were saved. He did not order the flood.</page><page sequence="27">THE IDA OF THE RIGVEDA. 345 god of the atmospheric region, before he was changed into the warrior god of the Sakas or Scythians. The word Idah in the plural, which is used in the ritual of the sacrifice to the seasons, apparently means the two Idas who, as male and female, were the ancestors of Nahusha, the great serpent, the father of the royal families of the snake race.1 This snake race is the black race,2 which is said in Rig. i. 130. 8, to be descended from Manu, and this shows that the myth which makes Manu the thinker the father of Ida, the mother earth purified by the sanctifying waters, is much older than the Rigveda. In the Ida, or Ila, stanzas of the Apr! hymns Agni is, in Rig. i. 13. 4, i. 188. 3, x. 70. 3, and x. 110. 3, called on as the agent or messenger of the gods to bring them all to the sacrifice, no names being specified. In Rig. i. 142. 4, and v. 5. 3, Agni is called on to bring Indra, and in ii. 3. 3 the Maruts, whom Indra loves. But the most noteworthy stanzas are those in Rig. vii. 2. 3, and ix. 5. 3. In the first the god summoned is the messenger of both worlds who speaks the truth, whom Agni allows us to honour by offerings after Manu's fashion. This is a clear reference to the Ida of Manu, the mother of all things, created by the thought of the creator. In Rig. ix. 5. 3 the god invoked is " the rippling light, which shines as a bright treasure in the stream of the swift drink." The theological change which made intoxicating drink a creative agent will be more fully considered further on when I come to speak of the Soma sacrifice. Here I will merely say that this invocation, like the summoning of Indra and the raising of Ida from the waters, marks a further stage which was reached in the evolution of speculative inquiry when the divine drink succeeded the waters as the emblem and mani festation of the creative spirit. As for the Maruts summoned in Rig. ii. 3. 3 they are, as I have proved before in these essays, the Nakshatras, or phases of the moon. They are the daughters of Daksha, the physical generative power, and belong, like the butter and fat drinking gods who are spoken 1 Mahabharata, Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxxv. p. 230. 2 Tvacam krshnam, Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 113.</page><page sequence="28">346 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. of in stanza 2 of the same hymn, to the older gods of the snake-worshippers. They are not related to the purified Ida, but are the daughters of the older mother earth called Kadrii, the mother of snakes. It will be shown later on that they are said to be dear to Indra, because Indra, the god of the atmospheric region, is the son of the same mother. We thus find that in these invocations the first three seasons represent (1) the heavens, which kindle the earth into life by the help of the divine fire, (2) the vital self-created energy, which creates and has created all things, and con trols the moon, the gods of time, and all natural changes, and (3) the mother earth, but not the original mother, but the earth purified by the waters. Thus we have a new earth and a new heaven, which has taken new life from the divine power of the fire-god, and a deeper significance is also given to the central ruling power than that attributed to it by the materialistic snake-worshippers. The three seasons repre sent the old triad under a new form. (4) The Bar his or Sacrificial Grass. The Autumn. In the triad which we have just considered we find two most im portant gods left out. They are the earth, the mother of the snake-gods, called Kadru, and the materialized father of all beings. They were looked on by the Indra worshippers who revised the ritual as inferior deities. But though denied precedence they were not altogether omitted, nor deprived of the sacrifices which were their due, and it is they who are called last to the sacrifice. The fourth invocation to the Barhis, representing the autumnal seed time following the rains, brings out, even more clearly than the first three invo cations, the idea that the principal duty of the ruling god or gods was to secure the natural replenishment of losses by decay and death, by the reproduction of young and fresh life. Most of the stanzas of the AprI hymns addressed to the Barhis call for little remark, as they are merely invocations to the sacred grass; but the Barhi verses in Pg. i. 13. 5, ii. 3. 4, and vii. 2. 4, which describe the grass as " fat besprinkled, " give evidence of the inner meaning of the sacrifice. I have already shown that in the Yedic sacrifices</page><page sequence="29">GODS RULING THE AUTUMN AND WINTER. 347 and those of the Brahmanas the butter or fat is the seed or divine sap which binds earth and heaven together, as parts of one great organism. And it is after the rains of early autumn have called to the fuller life of seed-time the plants which had been sown in the spring and developed in the summer, that these same plants shed their seed into the ground to await the resurrection of the coming year. There fore the Barhis or sacred grass are summoned to the sacrifice as representing the seed sown on the altar, which is the con secrated ground personifying the divine mother earth.1 The Barhis, therefore, represented the earth as impregnated with seed, and it is said to mean the earth in the ritual of Anu yaja or after-offerings.2 This sacrifice was originally the sacrifice to the mother earth, and the reformers of the ritual improved it by making it the sacrifice to the earth bearing seed. It will be shown afterwards that the sacrifice to the fathers and mothers which corresponds to this always took place in the autumn. Thus the time when the year sows the seed of future genera tions was held to be that when honours should be paid to the fathers and mothers who brought into the world the ancestors of those now living. (5) The Agni Svishtakrit or Rudra. The Winter. But though the seeds, from which the plants of the future years are to grow, are in the Barhi sacrifice sown in the sacred ground, they cannot start into life in the spring unless they are vivified by the quickening power which is the author of all living existence. This power is represented by the winter season. The god summoned is he who is by the later ritualists of the Brahmanas looked on as the chief repre sentative of the butter-drinking gods, to whom sacrifices are offered by libations of butter,3 instead of the older animal sacrifices which were by the reformers held to be impure. To purge themselves of the guilt of these animal sacrifices without defrauding the gods to whom they were offered of 1 Sat. Brah. iii. 7. 2. 1, vol. xxvi. p. 175. 2 Sat.

The divergence of view between these materialists and those who ascribed the vital creative power to the divine heat or the fertilizing water is shown in the substitution of the term "Muni" for "Daksha," as denoting the efficient cause of all things. " Muni" is the creative impulse,3 the life-giving spirit which touched and permeated the germs ready when awakened by the in-rush ing life to rise from death, grow, bud, blossom, and again transmit their immortal but sleeping vitality to the seed whence new generations are to arise. It is the old story of the sleeping beauty kissed into waking life by the destined prince, and it is he who in the Manu myth becomes the thinker. It is this divergence of view which explains the substitution of Muni for Daksha as the central power in the names of the last three months of the Hindu lunar year.4 In the Satapatha Brahmana Rudra is described as the god of cattle who was left behind and excluded from the sacrifice when the gods went to heaven, or, in other words, when the gods were looked on as heavenly, and not as earthly powers. He attacked them for their neglect of his claims, and to 1 Sat. Brah. i. 2. 3. 8, vol. xii. p. 51. 2 Sat.

The last stanza of each of the Apr! hymns is addressed to Agni Svishtakrit or Rudra. He is called to bring Indra, the Maruts, and Varuna in Rg. v. 5. 11, and x. 70. 11. In Rg. i. 142. 12 and 13 Vayu and Piishan are added to these three. In Rg. i. 13. 12 only Indra is called. In Rg. ix. 5. 11 the wind-god, Brihaspati (the lord of prayer), the sun god, Agni and Varuna, are called. In Rg. i. 188. 11, Agni is called to bring the gods without any being mentioned. In Rg. iii. 4. 11, and vii. 2. 11, the kindled Agni united with Indra, as the strong gods, are asked to come and sit on the sacred grass with Aditi, the mother, and in Rg. ii. 3. 11, the god who lives on butter is called to come. In all these hymns the supreme god of the later sun-wor shippers is only invoked once by name in Rg. ix. 5. 11, and then only through Agni. In the others Indra and Agni, who, in the minds of the Vedic poets, disputed the supremacy with the later sun-god and the earlier Varuna, occupy the most prominent place. In Rg. i. 142. 13, Rudra is invoked under his other name of Piishan,1 and the god who lives on butter of Rg. ii. 3. 11, and the Maruts who are his children, are merely Rudra under other forms. That Rudra was a phallic deity is fully proved by the ritual of the spit-ox sacrificed to him as described in the Grihya Sutras. This ox is offered not only to Rudra, but also to the serpents, which proves the phallic character of the sacrifice.2 Also Rudra in the two rituals of the Asvalayana and Parasara Grihya Sutras, as well as in the Satapatha Brahmana, is called among other names Mahadeva, or the great god. He 1 The identity of Rudra with Piishan is also shown by both being the god of cattle, Sat. Brah. i. 7. 3. 8, vol. xii. p. 201 ; iii. 1. 4. 9 and 14, vol. xxvi. pp. 22 and 23.

In other words Rudra represents the dominant and creative vital energy in its male form, and the mother earth is the same power in its female manifesta tion, while in the deification of the moon-god the power of giving life was ascribed to heavenly influences, and in that of Agni to the divine heat. That the sacrifice of the spit-ox was a relic of lunar wor ship is shown by the directions as to the colour of the ox which was to be chosen for the offerings. It was to be black with white spots, like the Egyptian sacred bull Apis, and therefore it was the animal sacred to the moon, and repre sented it as lighting up the darkness of the night. The whole of this analysis of the fore-offerings to the seasons shows that the sacrifice was looked on as the food of the gods, and that, as in the myth of Ida, who was the off spring of the sacrifice to the waters, and in the symbolical significance of each stage, it was thought to be one of the factors in the act of creation and reproduction.3 But this analysis also proves what is far more important, that the ritual as set forth in the Brahmanas is a complete compendium of early theological beliefs, and shows that those who worshipped the later gods used to propitiate those who had been first reverenced in almost forgotten ages. The stages of belief set forth in the ritual now analysed are as follows: I. The Sacrifice to the Mother Earth. The first sacrifice offered was to the mother earth, but this, as will be shown later on, did not take place on consecrated ground. Ritualism began with the hallowing of the ground on which the sacrifice was offered, and the altar which was 1 Sat. Brah. vi. 1. 3. 7, Muir, Early Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv. pp. 339 seqq. 2 Sat.

Brah. i. 8. 1. 30-35, vol. xii. p. 226, where the object of the sacrifice is said to be the production of offspring and cattle for the sacrificer.</page><page sequence="33">HISTORICAL SEQUENCE OF THE GODS OF THE TRIAD. 351 then heaped up became to the first materialists the symbol of the sacred mother. In the Satapatha Brahmana the altar is not only said to be the earth,1 but also the earth as the woman from whom all things are born,2 in other words, the mother earth. The altar prescribed in the Brahmanas was an altar of earth, and elaborate directions are given, as will be shown later on, as to its dimensions; and the original altar among the Jews was also of earth.3 The blood of the victim, which was poured forth on the ground, was the food requisite to supply the strength, without which the offspring created by her own inherent creative force could not be produced; and it is this sacrifice which is represented in the Barhis ; the melted butter sprinkled on the seeding-grass being the substitute for the original libations of blood. II. The Sacrifice to the All-Father, the Male or Snake-God. To this original worship of the mother-earth was added that of the male element, which was thought to embody the material power (Daksha) necessary for the work of produc tion, and this power is invoked in the Agni Svishtakrit or Rudra. III. The Sacrifice to the Power Animating the Male and Female Principle. But neither the earliest theological generalization, which ascribed the creation of all things to the mother-earth, nor the subsequent union of the two material creative powers, was thought by subsequent inquirers to be a sufficient explanation of the mystery of creation and reproduction. Consequently the power animating the two active agents was separated from them and made a third god, controlling and giving life to the other two. And this power was originally represented in the Idah male and female, which are still worshipped as the Viraj, the male and female principle 1 Sat.

But this creative and reproductive force was at a very early period transferred to the moon, when the moon was adopted as the measurer of time, and became the domi nant god of the earliest period of time measured by months, the ten lunar months of gestation. It was from her that all reproductive elements derived their power, and hence Soma, the moon goddess, took the first place in the triad as the power animating the two materialistic deities. IV. The Later Triad. The earliest triad after the first revision, by which the moon-goddess was made the ruling power, underwent several successive changes. The first appears to be that which substituted Agni or the god of the fire-stick (Swastika) for the male god, and according to this innovation it was he who was the author of the divine heat, which was the efficient cause of life both in heaven and in earth. This was apparently the doctrine of the race of handicraftsmen and workers in metal, who, as I have shown in the Appendix, were the race who first used the full lunar year of thirteen months. They were the sons of Kasyapa, and are called in the Mahabharata the Kusikas. But besides this original Agni or fire- god, who was also the Uras2 of the Northern Akkadians, there was another Agni, who was the god spoken of in the Rigveda as the messenger and agent of Varuna. He was the fire-god of the northern tribes of Aryan descent. It is this last Agni, united with the older god, who appears in the invocations to the seasons as the Samidhs or kindling sticks. Subsequent to these changes, and to the substitution of Varuna the heaven for the male-god, there came the great revolution caused by Indra worship. In the Satapatha Brahmana it is Indra who, as Tritu the Aptya or god of the 1 This is shown in the bas-relief of the Viraj in the caves of Elephanta. 2 This was the god known to the Semite-Akkadians as Adar (Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 151).</page><page sequence="35">THE LATER TRIAD. 353 waters, killed Visvarupa, the three-headed son of Tvashtri,1 and in the Zendavesta it is Thraetaona who killed Asi Dahaka the three-mouthed snake,2 and the malignant power destroyed in both cases is the materialistic triad. It was the worship of Indra which changed the whole aspect under which nature had hitherto been regarded, and which made the fertilizing waters the central power which united heaven and earth, the father and mother of all things, and made them both fruitful. I have shown how the working of this change is shown in the myth of Manu and Ida, and it seems to have gone further than the substitution of a new creative agency for the old materialistic god, for under the influence of the Indra-worshippers the moon-goddess was deposed from her place as the measurer of time. The proof of this is to be found in the fact that Sakko, the Pali vernacular name for Indra, is the god placed at the head of the thirty-three gods of the Tavatimsa heaven, whom I have shown to be the ruling gods of the lunar year.3 The worship of Indra in its turn succumbed to that of Vasuki, or Yishnu; but in this change it was Vishnu who was substituted for Varuna as the third person in the triad, while Siva reappeared as the phallic god at its head.4 In this triad the ruling god was Pushkara, the moon, meaning the divine lotus, or the mother of the earth resting on the sanctifying waters, and the lotus appears in the Mahabharata as a symbol of Indra, who gives to the god Vasu, king of Chedi, a garland of unfading 1 Sat.

But Sakko here may mean Indra, as the old phallic god who undoubtedly ruled the earliest year of the thirty-three gods, that of lunar months of twenty-eight days, and the nve seasons. 4 The name Siva does not appear in the early sacred writings, where the only name like it is Sankara. It is possible that the name may be that of Saiva or Saiv, the protecting deity of the Northern Finns, which Castren says is "ein allgemeines Gotter-epithet," and if so, Siva, like horse-worship, would be one of the numerous importations of the Sakas, which will be noticed further on.

Brown, jun., p. 23, published in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, April, 1888.</page><page sequence="36">354 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. lotuses.1 We thus see that the popular " trimurti" contains in itself an epitome of the successive phases of religious belief. It was the varying aspects of the mystery of creation which led the religious thinkers of the Veda first to place the ruler of heaven and earth apart, as Tanunapat, the self-created, and afterwards to make him the loving father of men as Brihaspati, the lord of prayer. I will now proceed to show in fuller detail that this succession of beliefs represents the actual historical sequence of religious speculation, and will begin by inquiring into the history of the worship of the divine mother. The Worship of Mother Earth. I have already shown in Part III. of this series of papers that in the Tamil year Tai, the mother, occupies the place assigned to Pushan, or Poos, in the list of Hindi months.2 Thus, according to the ancient calendar, while Rudra, or Sankara, ruled the close of the year,3 the beginning of the new year was sacred to Tai, the mother. The change which made over to Pushan, the male god, the month once sacred to the self-created and creating mother was made when the male element, which was disregarded in the original view of creation, was exalted above the female. This change seems to have originated both in the Euphrates valley and in Northern India among the worshippers of Hea, the water snake-god, who represented the deification of the water of life among the Sumero-Akkadians. These were the people called in India the Haihayas, a name which, as I shall show 1 Mahabharata, Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxiii. p. 172. 2 J.R.A.S. July, 1889, p. 581. But the Tamil Tai also appears in the names of the months and Nakshatras in the Taittiriya Brahmana, i. 5. 1-2. Preface to Max Miiller's edition of Rigveda, vol. iv. pp. 34-35, where Tishya is given as the name of the Nakshatra Pushya, and Taishah as that of the month Paushah or Push. 3 Part II. of this series of papers, J.R.A.S. April, 1889, p. 320. It may here be noted that though none of the names of Siva appear in those of the last month of the year, he really appears under a much older form. The month before Push is Marga in Tamil, and Mrigasirsha in Hindi. The name means the deer-headed god: this was the gazelle which was sacred to Mul-lil, the original Akkadian moon-god of the phallic triad. It was the sacred gazelle who became the ram, the successor to the Tamil or Dravidian goat, in the signs of the Zodiac, and who became in India Pushan, Rudra, Sankara, and Siva.</page><page sequence="37">TRANSFORMATION OF THE EARTH GODDESS INTO IDA. 355 fully later on, means the sons of Hea; and Piishan was, as I shall also show, the form under which the phallic god was especially worshipped by those who looked on Indra, or the god of the fertilizing rains, as the chief god. Their rule does not seem to have extended south of the Godavery, and hence the original Tamil name of the month meaning the mother was preserved in the south, and Pushan substituted for it in the north. The ancient reverence paid in Northern India to the great mother is still shown in the Hindu festivals of the 3rd of Mrigasirsha, 3rd of Magh, and the 3rd of Baisakh. All these are in honour of the goddess who under various names represents the mother earth, but the greatest of all these festivals is the Durgapuja held in Bengal on the 7th day of the lunar month Assin (Asvayaja).1 In the myth of Manu, to which I have already referred, Ida, when she rose from the waters, is said to have been claimed by Mitra-Varuna, the moon-goddess and heaven, as their daughter; but she would not acknowledge them as her parents, and remained constant to her real father, Manu the thinker. In other words, she owed her origin to no material parentage, but, like the Greek goddess Athene, who sprang armed from the head of Zeus, she was born from the thought of Manu. It is thus proved that the deification of the sanctifying water of life was the product of earnest thought on the mysteries of creation, and was an explanation which united the worship of the gods with a purer rule of conduct. It was when she refused to acknowledge Mitra-Varuna as her parents, that Manu gave her the middle or highest place in the sacrifice. Hence the bisexual Idah, who have the middle or the third place among the five seasonal gods, represent a later form of the great goddess who, before the 1 Alberuni's India, Sachau's edition, chap, lxxvi. vol. ii. pp. 179, 182, and 183. The goddess is called by Alberuni Gauri, a name by which she is still known, but her more usual name is Durga or Lakshmi. She is also called Kali and Uma, which last is merely another form of the name Amma or mother, and also Parvati or the mountain goddess. She is also the Amma or mother worshipped under various names by aboriginal tribes such as the goddess Ammakuveri of the Kodagas of Coorg, Mariamma or Poleramma of the Kurus of the Dekkan, Kom malamma and Sarlamma of the Kois or Gonds.

Therefore it is said in the ritual of the Brahmanas, " He who performs the sacrifice with the Ida ceremony propagates the race which Manu generated/'l The ancient place of Ida in the sacred hierarchy is still more clearly shown in the Aitareya Brahmana, where the priest who brings fire to the animal sacrifice is ordered to place it in the centre of the central altar, saying, "We place thee in the place of Ida, in the centre (navel) of the earth, to carry up our offerings." 2 Again, in the Satapatha Brah mana the priest, when he calls Ida to the sacrifice, is said to call the triad of the earth, air, and sky.3 These passages, and the reference to Mitra-Varuna in the Manu legend, make it clear that the divine mother was once the centre of the triad of which Varuna, the heaven, and Mitra, the moon goddess, were the other members. She was the female form of the god who, in the mythology of the northern tribes, was called Ira, or Aryaman, the heavenly bull or cow, and which, as Siva-Uma, the Viraj or Androgynic form of the genera tive power, was worshipped by the southern mother and phallic worshippers. That Ida and the bull-cow Ira were connected is actually asserted in the Satapatha Brahmana in the passage where, when the priest calls Ida, the cows with the bull are said to be called.4 In the Soma sacrifice the Soma is brought to the outside of the consecrated ground by a sacred cow, who is called Ida and Chandra (the moon). This shows that Ida, the universal mother, afterwards be came the twin sister of the moon-goddess and the mother of Soma, the divine drink, which was her offspring. As the sacred cow steps into the sacrificial inclosure, the priest fills i Sat. Brah. i. 8. 1. 7-11, vol. xii. pp. 218-219. 2 Ait.

It is impossible to avoid the conjecture that the Roman Ides, the Greek Ida, the mother mountain, and the Hindu Ida, the mother earth, are all intimately connected. 3 Sat.

The earth, from which the dust is taken, is said to be Aditi, the mother earth.1 The myth which makes Ida the mother of Soma is the same as the Greek myth which makes Dionysus, the god of the vine, the son of Demeter, the mother earth. The Sacrifice to the Three Mothers. The above citations leave no doubt whatsoever as to the great and widespread reverence formerly paid to the earth as the mother of all beings ; but the great antiquity of the worship in India is most conclusively shown by the sacrifice to Rudra Triambakah, or Rudra with the three wives or mothers (Ambah). This sacrifice is in the Brahmanas directed to be offered after the completion of the Sakamedhah, the last of the three seasonal sacrifices, one of which was offered during each of the three seasons. The fact that in these sections of the ritual only three seasons are recognized, instead of the five seasons which, we have already seen, were acknowledged in the older ritual, is only one among the many conclusive proofs which will be adduced afterwards to show that these three seasonal sacrifices were introduced by the Northern tribes;2 but the ritual prescribed for them was based, as will be also shown, on the older ritual of the moon and snake-worship pers, who reckoned five seasons first and six afterwards. The Sakamedhah is the autumnal sacrifice; and as the ritual of the sacrifice when analyzed gives very clear and graphic proof, not only of the several stages in the evolution of religious belief which I have already traced in the five 1 Sat. Brah. iii. 3. 1. 2-12, vol. xxvi. pp. 59-62. 2 These correspond to the three yearly festivals of the Northern Scandinavians. The spring sacrifice (Vaisvadeva) to the MidsvetrarblSt or Jolablot, held at the time of the winter solstice. The summer sacrifice (Varuna-praghasa) to the Victory sacrifice Sigrblot, occurring about the middle of April, before the warlike expeditions of the summer. And the autumn sacrifice (Sakamedhah) to the winter sacrifice Vetrarblot, which took place about the middle of October.

In doing this I shall try to show the meaning of its several parts and the historical evidence furnished by them. The orthodox Sakamedhah sacrifice consists of three parts. First, the preliminary sacrifices, secondly the great oblation (Mahahavis), and thirdly the Pitriyajna or sacrifice to the fathers. The whole sacrifice is arranged in the Brahmanas in especial honour of Indra, the slayer of the Vritra, or serpents. Now the name by which Indra is known outside the Vedic literature is Sakra, or Sakko, the god of the Sakas, and when this is once remembered, and the whole tenour of the sacrifice considered, I think that no one will doubt that Sakamedhah means the sacrifice (medha) of the Sakas, and that it is not, as the authors of the Black Yajus try to make out, called Sakamedha because it is per formed (Sakam) simultaneously with the rising sun.1 I. The Preliminary Sacrifices. These consist of nine offerings.2 The Satapatha Brah mana directs3 that on the morning of the feast day a rice cake is to be offered to Agni Anikavat on eight potsherds; at midday a potful of boiled rice is to be offered to the Marutah Santapanah, or the Maruts the Scorchers ; in the evening a potful of boiled rice to the Marutah Griha medhinah, or the Maruts the householders. The grain in this last stage of the sacrifice must be whole, and it is boiled with milk milked from the cow into the pot in which the grain is boiled. The boiled milk and rice offered in this 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 5. 3. 2, vol. xii. pp. 408-409, note 2. 2 This is the number sacred to Vishnu, and shows that the ritual of the sacrifice had been finally arranged by sun-worshipping priests. The sacred number nine commemorates his three victories over the triple triad, the triad of heaven, the old Aryan triad of Varuna, Aryaman and Mitra ; the triad of the air; the triad of the Indra-worshippers of heaven, the fertilizing rains and the mother earth, and the triad of the materialistic earth-worshippers of the father, the moon and earth goddesses. See Sat. Brah. i 9. 3. 9, vol. xii. p. 268, also Part II. of this series, J.R.A.S. April, 1889, p. 303, where 1 show that there were only nine Rudras among the thirty-three gods of time in the solar-lunar year of Yishnu. 3 Sat.

After these offerings had been made without any fore or after-offerings, it is said to be optional with the priests to continue to offer on the same day the four remaining sacri fices which precede the Darvi-homa to be offered to Indra, or to postpone them till the next day.1 These four offerings are made to Agni and Soma, the Maruts Grihamedhinah and Agni Svishtakrit. They are all made with libations of melted butter taken from the butter which had been poured into a hollow formed in the two portions into which the porridge first made for the Maruts Grihamedhinah had been divided. The importance of these butter offerings to the older gods is shown by two alternative forms of the rites being given. These chiefly differ in the original pot of rice porridge being kept whole or divided into two portions, and in the butter being kept in a separate pot or poured into hollows made in the two porridge pots. These differences, which probably arose from the amalgamation of the worship of Agni with that of the phallic gods, appeared important to the priests, but need not concern us. If these offerings to the old triad of Soma, the moon-goddess, the Maruts Grihamedhinah, the mother earth, and Rudra, the father, with the addition of Agni, the fire-god, begin the second day, they are followed by offering part of the sacrificial rice prepared for the Maruts Grihamedhinah to Indra. This is called the Darvi-homa,2 and may begin the sacrifices of the second day. This is followed by an offering to the Maruts called Kridinah (the sportive), who accompanied Indra when he went to slay Vritra. Meaning of the Preliminary Sacrifices. Taking these sacrifices in order, the first is that to Agni Anikavat, or the sharp-pointed Agni. I have already shown 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 5. 3. 5, vol. xii. p. 410, note 2; Tait. Bran. i. 6. 6. 6; Katy. v. 6 3-5. 32-33. 2 Sat. Brah. ii. 5. 3. 17, vol. xii. p. 415.</page><page sequence="42">360 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. that Indra's thunderbolt, with which he slew the serpent gods, is said to be the fourth Agni.1 The thunderbolt is elsewhere said to be sharp-pointed, and is described as made of the point (anika) Soma, the divine drink, the barb (salya), and Vishnu the connecting piece (kalmala).2 So that Agni Anikavat is Indra's thunderbolt. The Marutah Santapanah (the scorchers) are the rays of the sun which burnt up the serpent race, and the Maruts Grihamedhinah, to whom rice and milk melted with butter are offered, are the nourishing house-mothers, the daughters or wives of Soma, the moon, the representatives of the universal mother after she had ceased to be the mother of the united tribe, and become the mother and guardian of the separate households into which the tribe was divided when family life and the worship of the household fire were sub stituted for tribal life and the worship of the tribal and territorial gods. This change, as I shall shortly prove, was one made by the northern immigrants who arranged these three seasonal sacrifices. The truth of the first part of this interpretation is con firmed by the sacrifice to Agni Anikavat being made on eight potsherds. These represent the four Agnis, the old triad and Indra's thunderbolt, whose strength is doubled by being formed into four productive pairs.3 Thus on the first day the sacrifices offered are to Indra as Agni, the thunderbolt, to the sun-god and the Maruts, or mothers. As the first two sacrifices to Agni Anikavat and the Marutah Santapanah are evidently later additions, it is clear that the original sacrifice was to the great mother, afterwards changed into one to the Maruts. This, as will be shown, ruled the rest of the sacrifice. The remaining four sacrifices intervening between that to the Maruts Griha medhinah and the Durvi-homa to Indra are made to Agni, Soma, the Maruts Grihamedhinah, and Agni Svishtakrit, or 1 Sat.

These four offerings evidently represent two forms of the old triad, one in which Agni, the god of the fire-stick, was the ruling and creative power, and the other in which this power was ascribed to the moon-goddess. In the earlier triad is the moon-goddess, the mother earth, and the father of all beings, and in the other the place of the moon-goddess is taken by the fire-god. On the second day at the sacrifice of the Darvi-homa Indra, like the four gods whose sacrifice preceded his, shares part of the porridge which was made for the Maruts Grihamedhinah and is again offered to him in his own name.1 This is followed by a sacrifice of a special cake to the mothers called Krldinah, the sportive or child bearing, as representatives of the great mother and the wives of Indra, who here represents the male principle. The sacrifice to the Marutah Krldinah is made on seven pot sherds, showing that they were the gods originally wor shipped in the sacrifice, and that they represent the seven gods reverenced before the sun-god, the eighth Vasu, was added. They are probably the seven messengers of Anu of the Akkadian theology, the servants of Matu, the wind god, who appears in the Mahabharata as Matali, the charioteer of Indra.2 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 5. 3. 17, vol. xii. p. 415, note 3. See also Tait. Brah. i. 6. 7. 3.' 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 199-200; Mahabharata, Udyoga Parva, xcvi.-civ. pp. 300-315. These seven messengers of Anu and the seven Vasus of the moon- and snake-worshipping Hindus were almost certainly the seven days of the week, which I have shown in the Appendix to have been first sanctified by the worshippers of the fire and water-god. The week as a measure of time was, as I have also shown, not reckoned till after the month, or rather perhaps the week was first used as a measure of time by the Sumero-Akkadians in connection with the year of gestation of ten months or forty weeks, a calcula tion which made forty the sacred number, and which caused the forty days and nights of the sacred rain to be regenerators of the earth at the flood. As this year was, like other Sumero-Akkadian primary institutions, connected with the worship of Hea, the water snake-god, the seven days of the week were con secrated to him first, and afterwards in India to his counterpart Indra, the god of the fertilizing waters. This explains the connection between Indra and the seven Marutah Kridinah. The weeks do not seem to have been reckoned in the lunar year of thirteen months, but to have come from the earlier year of ten months.</page><page sequence="44">362 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. II. The Great Oblation (Mahdhavis). This, which follows the nine preliminary offerings, is, like them, a sacrifice in honour of Indra. It consists of eight offerings : (1) A cake to Agni on eight potsherds, (2) a pot of boiled rice to Soma, the moon, (3) a cake on eight or twelve potsherds to Savitri, the sun, (4) a pot of boiled rice to Sarasvati (the possessor of speech, saro), the river-goddess, mother of the Aryan race, (5) a pot of boiled rice for Piishan, (6) a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra-Agni, (7) a pot of boiled rice for Mahendra, or the great Indra (Maha-Indra), a name assumed by Indra after he slew Vritra, the serpent god, and (8) a cake on one potsherd for Visvakarman, the creator or maker (karman) of beings (Visva).1 Now, comparing these offerings with the seven made at the Vaisvadeva or spring sacrifice,2 we find that the first five offerings are the same in both sacrifices, but in the Vaisvadeva sacrifice the sixth is a cake to the Maruts on seven potsherds, exactly like the offering made to the Marutah Krldinah in the Sakamedha sacrifice, and the last or seventh sacrifice is one cake on one potsherd to Heaven and Earth conjointly, as the agents by which Prajapati, the lord of all beings, created all things. The gods of the Vaisvadeva sacrifice clearly represent an earlier phase of religious belief than that shown in the Maha havis of the Sakamedha, and the proof of this is given in there being seven offerings instead of eight, the number offered to the gods of the sun-worshippers. But the mean ing of the several gods to whom sacrifices were offered will come out more clearly on comparing these sacrifices with the five seasonal sacrifices already described. The five gods of the seasonal new and full moon offerings are as we have seen (1) The Samidhs or kindling-sticks, (2) 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 5. 4. 3-10, vol. xii. pp. 418-419. 2 Sat Brah. ii. 5. 1. 8-17, vol. xii. pp. 386-388. Vaisvadeva are the Devas or gods of the country (Vis), the indigenous gods ; but though called indigenous, the comparison with early indigenous lists shows that several of them were im ported at a late period, such as Savitri the sun, Sarasvati the Aryan mother, and, as I shall also show, Pushan.</page><page sequence="45">THE MAHAHAVIS AND THE SEASONAL OFFERINGS. 363 Tanunapat, (3) Idah, (4) the Barhis, and (5) Agni Svish takrit or Rudra. Now the Agni in the Vaisvadeva and Sakamedha sacrifices is plainly the same as the Samidhs, only the Samidhs bring out more clearly the fact that the god of the fire-stick (Svastika) was regarded by his worshippers as the active agent in the work of generation, as he, by in fusing the divine heat, did the work originally attributed to the phallic god. Tanunapat is, as we have seen, spoken of in the Rigveda as the moon-god; but the moon-god was the central ruling power by whose aid the male and female principles are made able to generate living beings. The god who in the five seasonal offerings is called by the mystical name Tanunapat, the self-created, is in those I am now dealing with called by the old name of Soma, the moon-god; but it is Soma when looked on as the great mother who generated life by the impulse (muni) given to her by the heavenly fire. I have already brought forward a great deal of proof, to which much more will be added in the sequel, to show that life was originally held to come from the mother. Therefore, considering that creation was first explained as an act of generation, when Agni, the fire-god, took the place once occupied by the earthly father, the moon-goddess, who watched over mothers about to bear children, and presided over the ten months of gestation, must have embodied the spiritual essence of the female principle, and these two gods represented the generation of the heavenly powers, and between them they represented the heavens as one member of the supreme triad. They were the two aspects of Varuna. In discussing the Idah I have shown that they represent the original androgynic or bisexual god, purified and spiritualized by thought into the deification of the agency of the fertilizing waters, and that they were held to be the central or ruling power in the sacrifice. Hence in the Vaisvadeva sacrifice the central place of the Idah is assigned to Savitri, the sun god, who is here said to be the " impeller " of the gods. It was the sun-god who was by the Semite-Akkadian wor shippers of Vishnu regarded as the type of the spiritual</page><page sequence="46">364 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. power from which all life proceeds. That power which was once assigned to the creative force animating the phallic gods as the bisexual agent, the moon-goddess or the fire-god, and which was then transferred to the waters, was by the last reform made over to the sun-god. When treating of the Barhis I showed that the seeding grass and the altar repre sented the pregnant mother, and she again appears in the Vaisvadeva and the Sakamedha ritual as Sarasvati (she who is possessed of speech), the river-goddess, who was the mother of the Aryan race, while in Piishan we have the phallic god Rudra, but not the original god represented by the linga, but the bull-god of cattle, also called Pasupati, lord of cattle,1 the father of the Haihayas, or sons of Hea, the adorers of the god of the fertilizing waters and the sacred rivers. He, like Ida, the purified mother, is the special phallic god of the Indra-worshippers. These were the races especially favoured by heaven, the Aryans living on the Sarasvati, and their near neighbours, the Haihayas or Iravata, living on the Iravati or Purushni river, the modern Ravi. The two remaining sacrifices in the Vaisvadeva offerings to the Maruts and to heaven and earth are especial sacrifices to the gods of time. That to heaven and earth, or to Pra japati, is the sacrifice to the great god who rules the lunar or sacrificial year; and that to the Maruts, which is offered on seven potsherds, is the sacrifice to the seven days of the week, forty of which periods complete the sacred period of gestation. Of the whole series of seven sacrifices, the first two represent the heaven, or Varuna; the next three the 1 Mr. R. Brown, jun., author of " The Great Dionysiak Myth," and other learned works on Grseco-Akkadian mythology and ethnology, has kindly suggested to me what seems to him to be a probable Akkadian derivation for Piishan. He thinks it may be derived from pu, meaning 'marsh, watery element,' su ' power,' and ana ' god.' His appearance as the phallic god in these sacrifices, which show everywhere the strongest possible indications of the influence of Indra-worship, is only one of the proofs which specially connects him with this cult. I have further worked out the connection, when treating of the Greek Poseidon. He appears to be the male god of the Haihayas or sons of the fish-god Hea, who exactly answers to the name Pu-su-ana. Further evidence in proof of this con clusion is given by the name Pushkara. This was the name given to the moon goddess by the Indra-worshippers, and is interpreted as meaning the "lady of the divine lotus," but it also means the maker (kar) of Push, or, in other words, the sacred cow, the mother of the bull Push.</page><page sequence="47">ANALYSIS OF THE TEIADS. 365 Aryaman, or Ida, which was once the bull with the two cows, Ida the universal, and Sarasvati the tribal, mother, but which was altered by the change from Ida to Savitri;l and the third the seed-bearing mother earth. In the Sakamedha sacrifice this simple and original picture of the inner meaning of natural changes has been distorted by the later Indra-worshippers, who worshipped Indra not as the peaceful god of the fertilizing waters, but as the warrior-god of the Saka invaders. They inserted a central warrior-god in the original duad of the heavenly and earthly gods of time, discarded the Maruts representing the mother earth, and made Mahendra, the great Indra, the ruler of a new triad, or the god from whom Visvakarman the creator derives his power. This analysis of the first two parts of the Sakamedha sacri fice, (1) the preliminary offerings, and (2) the Mahahavis, has, I would submit, not only fully proved the great import ance assigned in it to Indra, but also shows how the Indra worshippers had gradually altered the older ritual by changing the meaning of the old gods to suit their new conceptions, and by adding new gods to the original ritual. The Indra worship thus introduced superseded three suc cessive triads which had one after another been worshipped, when a third power was thought to be necessary to account for the generation of successive series of living beings, and this again was preceded by an earlier stage of religious belief. First there was the mother earth, then the father and mother of all things, and then came the triads in the following order: I. (1) The father, (2) the life-giving bisexual power, (3) the mother earth. II. (1) The father, (2) the moon-goddess, (3) the mother earth. 1 It seems probable that Savitri was originally feminine, and meant the sun maiden. She is certainly a feminine goddess in the beautiful myth telling of the devotion of Savitri the sun-princess, daughter of Asvapati, the lord of horses and king of the Madras, to her husband Satyavan, son of Dyumatsena, the exiled king of the Salwas, and of how, as Orpheus rescued Eurydice, she redeemed her husband from the god of death, by whom his life was taken after they had been married a year. See Mahabharata, Vana (Pativrata Mahatmya) Parva, ccxcii. ccxcviii. pp. 864-883.</page><page sequence="48">366 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. III. (1) The self-producing fire, (2) the moon-goddess, (3) the mother earth.1 This system was fundamentally altered by Indra-worship, which discarded the material agents of the earlier theologists, and made the god of the water of life and of the fertilizing rains the father of all beings. This change probably origin ated in the regeneration of Hea worship among the Sumero Akkadian races, which is ascribed in the Zendavesta to Thraetaona, who slew Azi Dahaka, the three-mouthed snake of Bawri (Babylon), and probably the Aryans had a good deal to do with it, as with most, if not all, other religious reformations recorded in history. The wrhole evidence shows an intermixture of the Aryan triads with that of the phallic snake-worshippers. The triad in which the fire-god becomes the father appears to be of Aryan origin, and the Aryans had also a triad in which Varuna the heaven is the first god, Mitra 2 the moon-goddess the second, and Ida 3 or Aryaman, the sacred bull or cow, afterwards called Prithivi, the earth, the third. When Indra-worship became the accepted religion, this triad, which was that of the Vedic bards, became Dyu, or the heavenly bright one, Indra and Prithivi, Indra taking the central place of the moon-goddess instead of his original place as the father. No one who has studied the Rigveda and early Sanskrit literature can doubt 1 Similar triads with the two female goddesses appear in Biblical genealogy and in the Zendavesta. In the Bible as Lamech with his two wives Adah and Zillah. Lamech is, as Dr. Sayce shows, the Semitic equivalent of Lamga, a name which I have identified with the Hindu Linga. Adah and Zillah mean darkness and shade, or the moon-goddess of night and the mother earth. See Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 185-186, note 3 of p. 185, and Part III. of this series, J.R.A.S. July, 1889, p. 538. In the Zendavesta the triad is Azi Dahaka, the snake-god, and his two wives, Savanghavach and Erenavach, who were after tlie death of the snake-god married by his conqueror Thraetaona.

There can, I think, be no doubt that the whole of the ceremony of the Mahahavis w7as introduced by the Sakas, and that the original preliminary sacrifices of what were the autumnal sacrifices to the fathers and mothers were the five offerings to the sacred triad and the tribal mother and father.1 The next stage in the sacrifice was the offerings to the mothers who were originally worshipped as the mother earth, and appear in the present ritual as the Maruts Griha medhinah, and that this sacrifice was followed by that to the fathers, which is still retained as the Pitriyajrla, and marks the third stage of the sacrifice in the ritual of the Brahmanas. The Pitriyajna. The rules for this sacrifice are especially instructive. In them the fathers are divided into three classes : (1) The Pitarah Somavantah, or Soma Pitrimat, meaning the fathers accompanied by Soma, the moon, or Soma accompanied by the fathers. To them a rice cake on six potsherds represent ing the six seasons is offered.2 (2) The Pitaro Barishadah, the fathers seated on the Barhis, to whom unground parched barley grain is offered. (3) The Pitaro 'Gnishvattah, or the fathers consumed by fire, for whom one-half of the parched barley grain prepared for the Pitaro Barishadah is ground and made into porridge by being mixed with the milk of a cow suckling an adopted calf.3 1 This five-fold sacrifice, representing the year, is continually said in the Brah manas to be the oldest form of offering, Sat. Brah. i. 2. 3. 7 and 8, and i. 7. 2. 8, vol. xii. pp. 51 and 192; iii. 1. 4. 20, vol. xxvi. p. 24. 2 The six seasons were the number into which the full lunar year of thirteen months was divided by the southern nations. See Appendix. 3 Sat. Brah. ii. 6. 1. 4-6, vol. xii. p. 421.</page><page sequence="50">368 EARTHY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. The invita-tory and offering prayers addressed to each of these three classes and chanted by the priests at the sacrifice show the distinction between them most clearly.1 They are taken from four hymns of the Rigveda, Rg. x. 15, addressed to the fathers, Rg. ix. 96, i. 91, and viii. 48. These last three are all hymns to Soma, the moon, as Indu, the divine drop, sap, or essence,2 and all speak of this god as omnipotent, and as the ruler of gods and men. Perhaps Rg. ix. 96 gives the ideas embodied in the conception of the god in the clearest form. In it Soma is spoken of as the friend and charioteer of Indra (v. 2), he who calls down the water and rain from heaven (v. 3), the creator of prayer, of heaven and earth, of fire and the sun, of Indra and Vishnu (v. 5), he who inspires poetry and prayer, the heavenly bull who with the cow creates all things (v. 7), the god who gave creative force to Manu (v. 12). From these extracts it is clear that the god addressed is the one omnipotent and supreme god. But these three hymns to Soma as the god of gods are only used in the invocations to the Pitarah Somavantah and the Soma Pitrimat, that is, to the fathers who worshipped Soma as the divine essence or creative principle, who first gave life-giving power to the mother earth and afterwards to the father, and who from heaven, as the moon-goddess, directed the sacred period of gestation and generation, the so-called year of ten months and the full lunar year of thirteen months. The fathers of the last two classes, the Pitaro Barishadah and the Pitaro 'Gnishvattah, are only invoked in the stanzas of the hymn written ex pressly in their honour, and the gods spoken of in this hymn are not the gods of the old triad, but the gods of a later age, when Vishnu, the ruling god of the solar-lunar year, Soma, the divine drink, and Agni, the god of the heavenly fire,3 had taken the place of those of the earlier religions. 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 6. 1. 26, vol. xii. p. 428, note 6, where these prayers are recorded 2 Indu means * drop' or * sap,' Max Miiller, Lectures on Science of Language, 2nd series, p. 430, note. 3 A different god from the half-phallic god of the Swastika, the self-producing earthly fire.</page><page sequence="51">THE MOON-WORSHIPPING FATHERS. 369 Verses addressed as Prayers to the Pi tar ah Somavantah and Soma Pitrimat. The invitatory prayers to the Pitarah Somavantah are Rg. x. 15.1, ix. 96. 11, and to the Soma Pitrimat, Rg. i. 91. 1 and 20. In the first of these stanzas the three races of the fathers, the first, the middle, and the last, are addressed, showing that the author of the hymn recognized the same distinction into classes as is made in the Brahmanas. This is further shown in stanza 2 of the same hymn, where the fathers are classified as those who live in the air, in the earth, and in the villages. That is to say, into those who worship the earth-born gods, those who worship Indra or the gods of the air, and those who were the immediate ancestors of the race living in Northern India when the hymn was written. In Rg. iv. 96. 11 the bright shining Soma through whom our fathers did all their deeds is invoked, and here the meaning clearly oscillates between the bright shining moon and the bright and brightening drink. Rg. i. 91. 1 is more mysterious. In the first stanza Soma is thus invoked : " Thou, 0 Soma, surpassest all in wisdom. Thou, 0 Indu, leadest up the steepest path. Through thy guidance have the fathers received protection from the gods." Stanza 20 says, " Soma gives cows. Soma gives swift horses. She gives the son who is a cunning craftsman. He who honours Soma is crafty, in the house, in the feast, and in council an honour to the fathers." This hymn is shown by Max Muller to be, in the opinion of the commentators on the Upanishads, addressed to Soma, the moon-goddess,1 and in these verses it certainly means the moon-goddess in a mystical sense. It is she who as Indu, the vital sap carrying with it the creative force, leads up the steepest paths of the heavenly vault, and it is she, the creative spirit, who gives wealth in cattle, wisdom, and children. The offering prayer to the Pitarah Somavantah is Rg. x. 15. 5, and to Soma Pitrimat, viii. 48. 13. In the first of these verses the fathers who delight in Soma are called to 1 Kaushitaki Upanishad, ii. 8, Sacred Books of the East, vol. i. p. 286, note 2.</page><page sequence="52">370 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. come " and partake of the food placed on the sacred grass." This food is the butter, which we have seen was sprinkled on the grass and altar in honour of Rudra and the phallic gods. In Rg. viii. 48. 13 the address runs as follows : " Thou, 0 Soma, who art united with the fathers, who hast spread thy self over earth and heayen. It is Indu (the divine essence) whom we should serve with offerings and thus become the owner of all treasures." Here, as in Rg. ix. 96. 11, the meaning seems to waver between Soma, the shining moon, and Soma as Indu, the vital energy which kindles all things into life. Verses addressed to the Pitarah Barishadah. The invitatory verses to this second class of fathers are Rg. x. 15. 3 and 4, where they are called "the fathers rich in gifts, the children, and the highest step of Vishnu." They are asked to come and sit on the sacred grass and drink the Soma brought to them. The offering prayer is also taken from v. 2 of the same hymn, to which I have already re ferred, where the fathers are described as those living on the earth, in the air, and in the villages. The invitatory verses show that the fathers representing the highest step of Vishnu must be later than those who worshipped the moon-goddess, for, as I have already shown, Vishnu in his three strides vanquished the gods of the old religion and made his own the three regions ruled by the sacred triad.1 They are called on to drink Soma, which is throughout the Rigveda spoken of as Indra's special drink, and it was also the drink of the Sakas, as is proved by the mention of the Sakas in an inscription of Darius as they who prepare the Haoma, or Soma.2 Thus the Soma, the divine drink, was the favourite drink of the Sakas, who gave their name to the Sakamedha sacrifice. 1 Sat. Brah. i. 1. 2. 13, vol. xii. p. 15. 2 The Sakas are called in this inscription " Saka haumavarza," i.e. the Sakas who prepare the Haoroa or Soma, Penka, Origines Ariacee, p. 137. In the same inscription the Sakas are called " tigrakhanda," that is, having a pointed helmet. This epithet is very like the name Agni Anikavat, the sharp-pointed fire, which is, as I have shown above, the name of Indra's thunderbolt.</page><page sequence="53">OFFERING OF BARLEY PROVES NORTHERN DESCENT. 371 The offering of parched barley made to them instead of the rice-cake offered to the Pitarah Somavantah also shows a difference of race. Barley is in the Satapatha Brahmana Varuna's corn, and it was and still is the special food of the northern tribes in contradistinction to the rice eaten by the snake, moon, and mother worshippers of the south.1 The fathers, to whom parched barley was offered as sacrificial food, were those who came from the north, and who worshipped, as I have already stated, a different triad from that of the Southern Dravidians. Their supreme gods were Varuna, heaven, Mitra, the moon-god, and Aryaman or Ida, the sacred bull or cow, the mother earth. These, except Ida or Aryaman, who, as I have shown, is an Akkadian god,2 were certainly Aryan gods, or at least gods who were brought from Iran, as is proved by their names being all found as those of supreme deities in the Zendavesta.3 The place of Mitra, the moon-god, was subsequently taken by Indra, or rather by his earlier representative Hea, the Akkadian fish water-god. But in India the Indra of the Northern as distinguished from the Hea of the Southern tribes became a god of quite a different stamp from the deity of the fertilizing rains when he became the warrior god of the Sakas, and it is in this last capacity that he generally appears in the Rigveda. I have already shown in Part II.4 that probably the earliest Saka tribe which arrived in India were the Gandhara, called also Chitraratha, or charioteers, and Kusikas, and it was apparently to this people that the parched barley was offered as the most appropriate food for 1 Sat. Brah. ii. 5. 2. 1, vol. xii. p. 391. In the North-West of India at the present day the poorer classes all live on barley meal, while the richer eat wheaten cakes. Kice is almost unknown as food. 2 See above, p. 366, note 3, but she may have been an Aryan goddess introduced into the Akkadian theology. She is certainly not a snake-god. 3 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Introduction, ii. p. 29, and iv. 3. p. 58, also Fargard xxii. p. 229, vol. iv. Sacred Books of the East. Varuna is the Aryan name of Ahura Mazda, as Prof. Darmesteter points out; but the name Ahura in Ahura Mazda was, as he also shows, once Asura, and A sura points to an Akka dian origin, as also does the name Aryaman, which is evidently connected with the Akkadian Aim 'the bull.' But the triad which has its supreme gods in heaven clearly comes from a different source than that which ascribes the supremacy to the phallic god, and it is to the northern nations that its origin must be ascribed. 4 Part II.

I shall also later on furnish proofs of the special sanctity attached to horses by the Gandhari, and also by the worshippers of Indra. The whole evidence leads to the conclusion that the Pitarah Barishadah were the Scythian cavalry and chariot drivers who, with their Aryan allies, brought the worship of Indra, the warrior god, into India from the northern settlements in Central Asia. The whole worship of Indra, both as the god of the fertilizing rains and as the warrior god of the thunderbolt, points to a northern origin. It was a people who came from the dry and thirsty land of Central Asia who would naturally regard the being who fertilized the parched soil with the freshening and life-giving rains and who slew his enemies with the thunderbolt as the best and most powerful of all gods. Verses addressed to the Pitaro 9 Gnishvdttdh. These, who are the fathers consumed by burning, clearly means those who burnt their dead instead of burying them unburnt.1 This is distinctly shown by the offering stanza addressed to them Rg. x. 15. 14, where the dead who are burnt and those who are not burnt are spoken of, and the invitatory stanza Rg. x. 15. 11 speaks of them as those who were once consumed with fire. They were, like the Pitarah Barishadah, a northern race, as they received half the barley prepared for their predecessors, the fathers of the second class, but this was made into porridge mixed trith the milk of a coiv suckling an adopted calf. I have already in Part II. shown that the cattle-herding tribes are said to be descended not only from Rohini, but also from Krodha, the ancestress of the Kolarian race.2 The offering of cows' milk would seem to imply a connection with the later Sakas, the cattle herdsmen known as Bhojas, and not the earlier race of 1 Like the people of the later Bronze age in Europe, Lubbock, Prehistoric Times. 2nd ed. pp. 49-50. The evidence seems to show that in the beginning of the Bronze age the dead were buried in a sitting position ; it is towards the close of the period that burning begins to be universal. 2 J.R.A.S. April, 1889, p. 270.</page><page sequence="55">THE SACRIFICE TO THE THREE MOTHERS. 373 charioteers called Gandhari. They, as well as the Aryans, were, as I have already shown, closely allied with the Kolarians, as is proved by the legend in the Mahabharata of the Brahmins marrying Nishadha or Kolarian wives.1 These Kolarians were the adopted calf suckled by the sacred cow, and these legends apparently show that these tribes who were thus allied with the Kolarian race originally wor shipped the mother earth under the form of Ida, the sacred cow. This old worship reappears again in the sacred moun tain Ida, called the mother both in the Troad and in Crete, and in the legend of Pasiphae, the moon-goddess, and the Minotaur, which represents the union of the moon-goddess and the earth, known in Crete as the bull of Minos, and in India and Iran as the sacred bull and cow.2 The Sacrifice to the Three Mothers, the Rudra Triambaka. The evidence proving the three classes of fathers to repre sent the races who successively peopled India will appear much more convincing when the questions connected with this sacrifice are fully considered. In the first place both the great antiquity of the sacrifice and its former importance are shown by the fact that it is directed to be offered outside the consecrated sacrificial ground.3 From this it is clear that the sacrifice is one which was thought to be of national importance by a people who had not yet become sufficiently ritualistic to insist on consecrating a place for the perform ance of the sacrifice, or to make a sacred altar to represent the mother earth. If it still continued to be offered by those who thought a consecrated altar and hallowed ground a necessary adjunct of a complete sacrifice, it must have been thought a most essential ceremony by their predecessors, whose 1 J.R.A.S.

At the same time the prescribed rites show the sacrifice as offered by the official priesthood to be phallic, and therefore prove that it was from the earliest worshippers of the mother earth, who believed that the male and female principle were necessary factors in creation and production, that materialistic doctrines were derived. The priest in this sacrifice took a sacrificial cake, the sub stitute for the animal sacrifice originally offered,1 to a cross road to the north of the consecrated ground, and offered it there to Rudra and his sister Ambika. This he did by burying it in a mole-hill.2 But in the older ritual preserved in the Grihya Sutras it was not a cake, but the spit ox sacred to Rudra, which was sacrificed in the spring or autumn under the Nakshatra Ardra, which means the son of Rudra, and its blood poured out for the serpents or snake gods.3 The burying of the sacrificial cake in the mole-hill is clearly a reproduction of the custom of burying in the lands of the several members of the tribe, for whom the sacrifice was offered, part of the body of the man sacrificed in the Meriah sacrifices of the Khonds. Human Sacrifices originally offered to the Mother Earth. To prove the connection of the sacrifice of Rudra Triarn bakah with human sacrifices, and to show that it was first offered, not to Rudra, but to the mother earth, it is necessary to trace the history of similar sacrifices. In the first place, both in the Aitareya and Satapatha Brahmanas, human sacrifices are said to be those which were first offered,4 and we find the same precedence given to them in the history of all nations who killed sacrificial victims.

Isolated instances, several of which I distinctly recollect, still occur when crops threaten to be dangerously scanty, or when epidemics break out. The Meriah sacrifices of the Khonds were offered to Tara Pennu, the mother earth, but this Tara is not only a goddess of tribes speaking the aboriginal languages, but she is also worshipped by those who speak dialects derived from the Sanskrit. She has still her shrine in the sacred Budh gaya,1 and is described by Hiouen Tsiang as one of the most popular gods of ancient Magadha (Behar),2 and under the name of Durga she is the goddess most reverenced by the people of Bengal. What was offered to her was the blood of the victim, which was its life or vital essence.3 It was this life-giving blood which fertilized the earth, the mother of all things. Hence arose the idea that it was the blood of man, the most god-like of animals, which gave life to the earth and enabled it to bring forth the food, without which life could not be reproduced or sustained, and that therefore human sacrifices gave the earth not only the power of reproduction, but also the food which insured the continued use of this power. That this idea underlay all the old rituals is shown in the statement in the Brahmanas that man is the sacrifice.4 From this followed the further corollary, to which I have already referred, that the sacrificer owed himself to the gods. This gave rise to the saying in the Brahmanas that in sacrificing a victim the sacrificer sacrifices himself, or that he was sacrificed after having hallowed himself, by the ceremony of initiation, thus consecrating himself as the victim at the 1 Monier-Williams, Buddhism, p. 216. 2 Beal, Records of the Western World, vol. ii. pp. 103, 174. 3 Genesis ix. 4. 4 Sat.

Her priests were bound to sacrifice themselves by sacrificing their manhood, and it is this feeling, that the best offering to the gods is man, that is the origin of all ascetic observances. What ascetics propose to do is, by the elimina tion and uprooting of earthly desires, to promote the new birth of the spiritual nature, so that, like the sacrificer in the Hindu ritual, the old man may pass away to the gods, and the mere animal life be replaced by the newly-born divine soul, which will descend from heaven to consecrate the recipient to a higher and better form of existence.4 But though these ethical deductions from the doctrine 1 Sat. Brah. iii. 6. 3. 21, vol. xxvi. pp. 161-162. 2 Exodus xiii. 11-14. 3 Sat. Brah. iii. 8. 1. 15, vol. xxvi. p. 190. The same idea reappears in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where it is said, chap. ix. 22, that without shedding of blood there is no remission. 4 This belief in the necessity of sacrificing the manhood of the priests of Cybele is apparently the origin of the custom of making eunuchs in the East. Herodotus, i. 105, tells how the Scythians used to make Enarees (eunuchs) of their children, having learnt the practice from the worshippers of Aphrodite, the great mother, at Ascalon. He calls it the female disease. That this is a very old tribal custom among certain Tartar tribes, and that it was not by any means confined to children, is proved by its existence at the present day. A gentleman who has lived long in Eastern Europe, and who has a most intimate knowledge of the people, tells me that the males of a Tartar tribe called Lippovan or Lipprovans (he is not sure of the name) have been accustomed for ages to sterilize themselves either before or after they have had children. They have been expelled from Russia on account of this custom, but abound in Roumania, and in Bucharest almost all the cab drivers are eunuchs belonging to this tribe. These people are probably the descendants of the race called Sauromata?, who were, as Herodotus (iv. 110-117) tells us, formed from a union of the Amazons and Scythians, and the custom of sterilizing certain males probably arose during the matriarchate, to prevent the men of the tribe having intercourse with the females, for the rule was that the fathers were to be chosen from another clan than that of the mothers. Whatever the original custom may have been, it is certain that, like all Dravidian customs, it was most carefully regulated and enforced. When patriarchal succeeded matri archal rule, and the head of the household became the husband of a number of wives, who were regarded as his property, the custom of making eunuchs was retained, as a means of supplying guards for the women of the harem, and pre venting them from resorting to their former custom of temporary marriage.</page><page sequence="59">THE LIFE-GIVING BLOOD OF THE SACRIFICE. 377 which looked on man as the sacrifice are very ancient, they are incomparably more modern than the early beliefs of those who first offered sacrifices. To the earliest worshippers of the mother earth it seemed that it was only man who could make the earth bring forth its increase, and it was his blood which must give the earth that quickening energy which was necessary for the reproduction of life and the food which sustained it. Hence, in going back to the divine mother who gave both life and food as the author of all living existence, the oldest theologists reasoned still further back than their successors, who worshipped the father as the chief god. The primitive belief, that it was the shedding of human blood and the sacrifice of human life that gave creative and productive power to the earth, is reproduced in the legend of the death and rebirth of Jantu in the Mahabharata. King Somaka (the moon god) had one hundred wives, but only one son, Jantu. When he wished for more sons, his family priest (purohit) advised him to sacrifice Jantu in the presence of his wives. This would, he said, not only cause them all to become pregnant, but would bring Jantu to life again as the eldest of a hundred princes. Jantu was accordingly sacrificed, and the king obtained a hundred sons who were born from the blood of Jantu.1 It was the blood of the sacrifice poured out at the foot of the altar which was the vitalizing element in the early sacrifice to the mother earth,2 and these were offered before consecrated altars were introduced by the ritualists. The earliest altars were made, as I have already proved, of earth, and represented the earth as woman, the mother of all things.3 When the altar ceased to be of earth and became the stone or brazen altar, which had a phallic meaning, part of the blood which used to be poured on the ground was sprinkled on the altar.4 1 Mahabharata, Vana Parva, cxxvii.-cxxviii. pp. 386-389. 2 Leviticus iv. 18 and 25. 3 Exodus xx. 24 ; Sat.

The transition from the original theory of sacrifice, that the blood was the life infused into the mother earth, to the phallic theory, that the blood vitalized the linga, is best shown in the Hindu ritual. In this the sacrificial stake (yupa) plays a prominent part. The animal, instead of being sacrificed on the earth, is first bound by the neck to a consecrated stake. This stake is eight-cornered, like the linga, the eight corners showing that it was a linga of the four Agnis or of the eight Vasus.1 After being thus tied, the victim was killed accord ing to the ritual of the Scythian Indra-worshippers followed in the Brahmanas by being strangled; but this method quite ignored the meaning of the old sacrificial form of the Pitri Somavantah, who were snake and linga worshippers. They, as we are told, stabbed the animal behind the ear.2 The meaning of the old ritual clearly was that the animal tied to the yupa by the neck was stabbed so that the blood should spirt over the yupa or linga, and thence fall to the ground, thus fertilizing them both.3 The same text shows that the victim was tied, and which was inserted in the earth as the "linga" in the '* yoni." This is the form in which it appears in the Brahmanas, where each victim has its separate yiipa (Sat. Brah. iii. 7. 1. 22, and iii. 7. 2. 3-8, vol. xxvi. pp. 173, 176-178) or wooden stake, but at a very early period built altars of brick were used, as we learn from the Katha Upanishad i. 1. 15, where Yama tells Nachiketas " what bricks are required for the altar, how many, and how they are to be placed" (Max Miiller's translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xv. pp. 4 and 5). The Jewish altar, which was wood overlaid with brass, was discon nected with the earth, perhaps as a protest against phallic beliefs ; but on the other hand, it was by its horns connected with the heavenly triad, which succeeded earth and phallic worship. The horns represented the heavenly bull or cow, but not in their earliest form of the bisexual principle, but as the moon-god, who was the father and mother of all living beings. But the brass which covered it con nected it with phallic worship, as is shown by the brazen or healing serpent, which was an object of national worship. The brazen serpent was the Jewish representative of the old snake-god, who became the Greek Esculapius and the Egyptian Imhotep. Brass, as it still does in Hindu caste-rules, denoted purity, and consequently sacrificial and sacred utensils, the covering of the altar, and the sacred serpent, were made of brass. That Esculapius was an Eastern and phallic god is shown by the cock, an Eastern bird, being sacrificed to him, and by his having his hand entwined by a serpent. The later Jewish altar, or perhaps the earlier if Ezekiel is older than Leviticus, seems from Ez. xl. 42 to have been a stone altar. 1 Sat.

Historical Evidence arising out of the Sacrifice to the Mother Earth. We thus see that human victims were the first sacrifices made to the mother earth; that the human sacrifice was after wards succeeded by the offering of animals as a ransom for the sacrificer; and that then successive changes were made in the ritualistic methods, (1) as to the animals offered, (2) the mode of killing them, (3) the consecration of the altar and sacrificial inclosure, which must, under the very conservative customs of ancient days, have taken a very long time, as well as many changes of sacrificing rulers,1 to effect. These changes will be farther exemplified when I come to speak of the sacrificial animals. But all this long series of revolutions and reformations had in the time when the Brahmanas were written become a matter of long past history, as the sacrifices then offered were for the most part not living victims, but vegetable offerings. But before dealing with this branch of the question I must, in completing the account of the sacrifice to Rudra Triambakah, show that it must be a reproduction, not of the earliest form of earth-worship, but of one dating from a time subsequent to the rule in India of two previous ruling races. Ambika, who is said in the Satapatha Brahmana to be the sister of Rudra, is undoubtedly one of the three sisters Amba, Ambika, and Amvalika, who are called in the Mahabharata daughters of the king of Kasi (Benares), and who play such an important part in the mytho-historical legends of the poem. Two of these sisters, Ambika and Amvalika, were the wives of Yichittra Virya, the second son of the great Santanu, and on his death without heirs became, by the 1 Great changes snch as those noticed required at least a new dynasty, if they did not involve a total change in the ruling tribe.</page><page sequence="62">380 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. Eishi Vyasa (which means he who puts together, the uniter or compiler), the mothers of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, the fathers of the Kauravyas and Pandavas, Ambika being the mother of Dhritarashtra and Amvalika of Pandu.1 According to another myth they were the mothers of Jarasandha, king of Magadha, the father being the Pishi Chandra Kusika (the moon of the Kusikas), who by making a mango (am) fall into the laps of the two queens, made them each the mother of half the future king. The two halves were united by a Rakshasa, an aboriginal woman called Jara (old age).2 Amba, i.e. Am ma the mother, the eldest of the three, was carried off with her sisters by Bhishma, the eldest brother of Vichittra Virya, from the princes assembled at Kasi, but obtained her release by saying that she was engaged to be married to the king of Saubha, the mythical city of the sorcerers situated in the heavenly regions.3 In a subsequent legend this king, called there Salwa, is said to have rejected her, because she had been carried off by Bhishma. She consequently first became an ascetic, and was afterwards changed into a river in the country of Vatsabhumi or Bundelcund, which was the home of the Saka or cattle herding tribes. By the help of Siva she was reborn as Sikhandin, the child of Drupada, king of the Panchalas, who was destined to kill Bhishma. In her new birth she was first a girl, but afterwards, to fulfil her destiny, became a man.4 This last myth gives valuable proof of the course of religious evolution. Bhishma, the son of Santanu by the river-goddess Ganga, was Dyu, the eighth Yasu, the sun god.5 It was he who tried to overcome the Great Mother (Amba), but she remained constant to her former husband Salwa, who is evidently the Sal tree, representing the phallic 1 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lv. and lvi. pp. 319-323. 2 Sabha (Rajasuyarambha) Parva, xvii. pp. 5t-57. 3 The city of the Daityas, the sons of Diti, the great mother, the second month of the lunar year.

But the whole series of tales about Ambit, her two sisters, and their fortunes, gives not only the history of religious change, but a complete account of the succession of races who inhabited and ruled India. Whatever may be the meaning of the name Santanu,2 the great king who married the river Ganga, there can be no doubt that those of his two sons by Satyavati (the pos sessor of Satya, truth), the Matsya princess, are merely, like that of Bhishma, mythical names, and that they represent the succession of ruling races. Their names are Chitrangada and Vichittra Virya, and the whole story of their rule, death, and the birth of their heirs, is evidently mythical in form. Chitrangada, which means the variegated or coloured (chittra) bracelet (angadam), is, as I have shown in Part II., a name for the moon-god,3 and the story in the Mahabharata, that he was killed by the Gandharvas, is merely a reproduc tion of the Yedic account of the destruction of the snake worshippers by Indra, for the Gandharvas were, as I have shown, the horse-taming Scythians and the charioteers who are known in Indian history as Gandhari or Kusikas,4 and 1 The Kolarians of Chota Nagpore say that wherever the Sal tree (Shorea robusta), the finest forest tree in Central India, grows, there is their home. The religious and historical significance of the sal tree is shown in the story of the birth of Buddha. His mother was Maya, or illusion, the name for the great mother, adopted by the philosophers, who described religious speculation as the raising of the veil of Maya. When he was born she placed herself under the sal tree in the sacred grove of Lumbini. This was the sacred ancestral tree of the Kolarian Kolyas, to which tribe his mother belonged. The Buddha was not only born under a sal tree, but died under the sacred sal trees at Kusinagara. See Part I. of this series, J.R.A.S.

But the Gandharvas are also in their heavenly aspects the Gandarewa or wandering</page><page sequence="64">382 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. in one list of snake-gods who are dominants of the seasons, Chitrangada appears in the same place as Pushkara, the moon-goddess of the Indra-worshippers, appears in the later list.1 Vichittra Virya, his brother, who succeeded him, and who, after marrying, died of a consumption without heirs, means the virile energy, manhood (Vira), of two colours (Vi-chittra), and the whole story, when compared with that of the birth of Jarasandha, is indubitably a mythical account of the union of the two races, the Kauravya or black race, descended from Dhritarashtra, with the Pandavas or fair race, descended from Pandu the fair prince. They were united by the help of the Rishi Vyasa (the uniter), or in other words by Brah manical influence. As Pandu means fair, the Pandavas are necessarily the fair people, and the name Kauravya would seem to be derived from a root which appears in Sanskrit as ' kalas ' black, and in the Greek KeXatvo?.2 This interpretation is confirmed by the account of the birth of Jarasandha, which tells the same story of the union of the two races in a cruder form. In both stories the Brahmin Rishi is the active agent, but he appears in the Jarasandha myth not merely as the " uniter," but as the moon-god, and not only as the moon-god, but as the moon-god of the Kusikas. Now the Kusikas are the sons of Kas or Kasyapa, who I have shown in the Appendix to the present essay, in which I have traced the history of the year as a measure of time, were the people who first stars of the Zendavesta, who were killed by Keresaspa, the Kasyapa of the Zend avesta, and by Kutsa, the charioteer of Indra in the Rigveda. In that case Chitrangada (the coloured bracelet) would mean the mother's year of gestation, and his death would represent the conquest of the mother-worshippers by the Kusikas, who introduced the full lunar year of thirteen months. 1 Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, vol. ii. chap. lxi. pp. 118, 120 ; Part II.

They are the descendants of the demigod called Keresaspa in the Zendavesta, who ruled in the valley of Pishin in the Kabul country,1 where he is to sleep till the last day. They are the race of charioteers or Gandhari, and they are allied to the earliest worshippers of Indra as the god of the fertilizing waters. To turn again to the two stories I began to discuss. They both clearly mean that the children of the two mothers who form the triad of the mother-worshippers were united to gether as one people.2 This is further proved by the meaning of the words Jara, the name of the old woman who is said to have united the two halves of Jarasandha, and by that of Jarasandha, as Jara means old age and Jarasandha the union (sandhi) by Jara (old age) or lapse of time. The story is merely a mythical way of saying that the black and the fair people were united together by time. The same story is reproduced in another form in the legend of the birth of Astika, the sun-god, the eighth (asta) Vasu, whose father was the Rishi Jaratkara (he who is growing old), and his mother of the same name was sister of the snake-god Vasuki, the counterpart of Vishnu.3 This means that in the fulness of time the Aryan form of sun worship was born by the alliance of the worshippers of Vishnu the snake sun-god with the Aryan Brahmins. But the Astika myth is much later than that which refers the birth of the earlier races to the great mother and the moon god of the Kusikas. But there seems to be in these stories still further ethno logical evidence. The grandmother of the sons of Ambika and Amvalika was Satyavati, a Matsya princess. Now a 1 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Aban Yast. x. 37, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiv. p. 62. 2 It is the union between the two races, the southern and northern, formed after a long period of intestine war, which forms the story of the Mahabharata. But this union was not the earlier one mentioned in these myths. The ultimate union was that of people who had passed through a long and varied history before they finally amalgamated. 3 Adi (Astika) Parva, xl.-lviii. pp. 121-160 ; Part II. of this Series, J.R.A.S.

In Part II. p. 283, I have suggested that the name was given to them by people who looked on them as an inferior race, but further reflection and deeper study of the question has convinced me that this idea is utterly wrong. The authors of the Mahabharata never, like some of the hymn-writers of the Rigveda, scoffed at the ruling non-Aryan races on account of their origin, and they certainly would not habitually have applied to them a derisive name. Again, the name occurs in the Rigveda, and appears as the common Sanskrit name of a tribe, for it was the Matsya who in the great battle of the ten kings immediately followed the Turvasu in the attack on the Aryans.1 But the Matsya certainly were not Aryans, and therefore would not have called themselves by a Sanskrit name. Therefore the name by which they were spoken of by Sanskrit writers must, if not given to them as a mark of contempt, be a translation of their own. It therefore follows that the Dravidian name translated as Fishermen means the sons of the Fish. That this was actually the case is still more clearly proved by the legend of the origin of the Matsya as given in the Mahabharata. Their father Matsya, the brother of SatyavatI, is said to have been miraculously born from the god Vasu and the Apsara Adrika, who was living as a fish in the Jumna, whither she had been brought by the Suktimati, the river on which Vasu's capital stood.2 It will be further remembered that Amba became a river in Bundel kund, which was apparently the Suktimati, meaning " the dry mother/' or "the pure mother/' which was one of the tributaries of the Jumna.3 It therefore seems that the 1 Rg. vii. 18. 6 ; Part IT. of this Series, J.R.A.S. April, 1889, p. 230. 2 Adi (Vansava tai na) Parva, lxiii. pp. 174-175. 3 The meaning the " dry mother " is probably the original one, as the river in the Mahabharata is said to be filled only in rainy seasons. She became the "pure mother" when she was consecrated by the waters of Indra. The river is prob ably the Charmanvati, or rather its tributary the Parvati, which means the mountain mother, and rises in the ancient country of Chedi.</page><page sequence="67">THE HAIHAYAS SONS OF HEA THE FISH-GOD. 385 ancestor of the Matsya and his sister Satyavati (the possessor of truth) were the children of the fish-god and the mother earth. Now Dr. Sayce has shown that the Sumero-Akkadians called themselves " the black-headed sons of Ea, or Hea, the fish-god."l I have already suggested that the Haihaya, which is the vernacular tribal name of the most powerful section of the Indo-Akkadian linga and snake-worshippers, was connected with Ea, or Hea, the fish-god,2 and the Sanskrit name Matsya, which means the fishermen, or the sons of the fish, as well as the legend of the origin of this powerful nation, confirms the truth of my conjecture. It therefore appears to be all but certain that the name Matsya is merely a translation of the Dravidian tribal name Haihaya, and that this name, for which no derivation can be found in Sanskrit, is derived from the Sumero-Akkadian Hea. It therefore seems that two of the races from whom the sons of Ambika and Amvalika were descended were the Haihayas, the sons of the fish-god, and the worshippers of the mother earth. It is the legend of Manu over again, showing the origin of the race descended from the thinker, who was saved from destruction and retained alive to bear descendants by the help of the horned fish-god, and who, through the purified earth Ida, became the father of the black race assigned to him as children in the Rigveda.3 This explains the origin of the black race of the Kauravya. But the further question then arises as to how the fair or white element came in. Both the sacrifice of the Rudra Triambakah and the legend in the Mahabharata prove that the black races, who are sons of the father called in Sanskrit Dhritarashtra, or he who holds the kingdom, together claim descent from the mother Ambika; while the sons of Amba, the eldest mother, are ignored in the sacrifice, and they are in the legend treated as dead without descendants, like the moon and snake-god of the mother-worshippers, Chitrangada. 1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p.

The Hindi name for the Haihaya is " Haiobuns," meaning " buns" sons of Haio, which is almost exactly the same word as Hea. 3 Rg. i. 130. 8.</page><page sequence="68">386 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. The real explanation of this apparent omission appears to be that the original mother Amba is merged in the purified mother born of Suktimati (the pure mother), as Satyavati (the possessor of truth) by her connection with the Rishi Parashara, which took place in a mist (the form assumed by the god of the water of life),1 became the mother of Vyasa (the uniter), and was thus the mother earth purified as Ida was in the Manu legend. She and Ambika must have been the first two mothers, Amba representing the snake and mother-worshipping races, who, according to the legend, came to an end in Chitrangada, and Ambika the Kusikas or charioteers of Kasi, united with the descendants of the transformed Amba, the purified Satyavati, and the whole story tells of the union of three races, the mother-worshippers, the linga-worshippers, who had become sons of Hea, the snake-god of the fertilizing waters, after the reformation made by the Indra-worshippers, and the Kusikas or the northern tribes. Ambalika (meaning the little mother), from whom the fair races were born, must have been a later addition to the first two mothers. Now in the genealogies of the Mahabharata there is a king before Santanu, called Janamejaya, whose three eldest sons are Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vahlika, while Vahlika again appears as the brother of Santanu, the youngest of the three brothers Santanu, Devahi, and Vah lika.2 It therefore seems that Vahlika must have been the reputed ancestor of one of the ruling tribes, or he would not have been so repeatedly mentioned with the ancestors of other tribes. Bohtlingk-Roth interpret Vahlika as meaning a native of Balkh, and the Madras, whose king Salya was father-in-law of Pandu, and one of the principal allies of the Kauravyas, were also called Bahikas,3 while Vahlikas and Vahlika himself are found fighting in the Kauravya army.4 1 Mahabharata, Adi (Sambhava) Parva, cv. p. 318.

Though it is almost impossible to discriminate the races accurately among the mazes of the genealogies, one thing is clear, that the three mothers represent three races. One the ancient mother and snake-worshippers, the second a mixed race composed of the sons of Hea and the northern Kusikas the charioteers, and the third the Semite-Akkads, mixed with the cattle-herding Sakas, and forming the race of the Ikshvaku. These three races are again represented in the Dravidian races acknowledged by the Tamil-speaking people: (1) the Pandyas, equivalent to the Pandavas, (2) the Kerala or Chera, the Kauravyas, and (3) the Kola or Cholas,1 the Kolarian and mother-worshipping tribes. But the three races sprung from the three mothers appear not only in the title of the sacrifice made to Rudra with the three wives Tryambakah, but also in the Rigveda. I have already, in Part II. of this series, dwelt on the important historical evidence to be gathered from the names of Ida, Bharati or Mahi, and Sarasvati, the three river-goddesses who are especially invoked in the Apri hymns.2 These were doubtless the original three mothers, but the mothers greatly altered by the repeated changes made on religious and ethnical grounds. Ida was Ambika, the mother of the in the Drona Parva. In sec clxiii. p. 438 Vahlika's grandson Bhurisravas bearing a banner marked with the ''yupa'' or sacrificial stake (showing that the custom of tying the victim to a stake came from the north) was killed by Satyaki, the grandson of Sini (the moon-god).

He says they are the original inhabitants of Coromandel, and gives in another list of races a fourth race Kola. As the Dravidians so often soften the guttural, it would seem that Kola was the original form altered by Dravidians into Chola, and that it must mean the Kolarian tribes. 2 Part II. J.R.A.S.

This was a very mixed race, formed from unions between the descendants of the worshippers of the original mother Amba or Mahi, the Kusikas, and the Haihayas, the sons of the fish - god Hea. Mahi or BharatI was the original mother Amba, from whom the first Dravidian immigrants, the mother worshippers, the earliest snake and linga-worshippers, and the Kolarian tribes assimilated by them, claimed to be de scended. Sarasvatl (the possessor of speech, saro) was the mother of the Aryans, and of their allies the Scythian tribes settled with them on the Sarasvatl. That they were from a very early period intimate allies is proved by the narration in Rg. iv. 30. 18 of the battle on the Sarayu or Satlej between the Aryan Arnas and the Scythian Chitraratha on one side, and the Yadu Turvasu on the other, in which the Yadu Turvasu were the victors. It was also chiefly by the help of the Siva Bhojas or cattle-herding Scythians, living between the Satlej and the Ravi, that the Aryans inflicted a crushing defeat on the northern confederacy of the Kuru Takshakas in the battle of the ten kings.1 Summary of the Conclusions to be drawn from the Sakamedha Sacrifice. I have now completed the analysis of the Sakamedha sacri fice, and have brought forward my reasons for suggesting that this sacrifice, combined with that to the Rudra Triam bakah, helps greatly towards proving the successive rule in India of at least six races in pre-Vedic times. These were: (1) The Kolarian tribes. (2) The first Dravidian immigrants, the worshippers of the mother earth. (3) The linga and snake worshippers, who were also Dravidians. These two races ascribed the creative and reproductive power to the bisexual material god. (4) The Kusikas or moon-worshippers who introduced the full lunar year, and ascribed the creative and reproductive power to the moon-goddess who ruled the lunar year. It was also this race which introduced fire i Part II. J.R.A.S. April, 1889, pp. 231-234.</page><page sequence="71">EVIDENCE OF ARYAN INFLUENCE. 389 worship. (5) The Indra-worshippers, who were the sons of Hea the fish-god, and who were the first great religious reformers. They were allied with the first Scythian invaders, who were the Gandhari, and who joined the Indra-worship pers in the revision of the ritual. (6) The last immigrants in pre-Vedic times were the cattle-herding Scythian tribes. The first four races appear in the Pitriyajna as the Pitarah Somavantah and the Soma Pitrimat, the fifth as the Pitaro Barishadah, and the last as the Pitaro 'Gnishvattah. Each of these immigrations was accompanied by a change in ritual and by an alteration in religious belief, which I have traced out in the successive triads. The Evidence of Aryan Influence. The Aryans, who have not been included in the above list, seem from a very early period to have had an active share in the successive religious changes. It is probably owing to their influence that the ruling power was transferred from the materialistic gods to the ruler of heaven, to the fire-stick, and to the god of the fertilizing waters ; but all these changes were produced by them when they were half-incor porated with the tribes already ruling in the country before their advent, and they did not appear as a distinct and separate nationality till they settled on the Sarasvati. Throughout their whole history their influence, when peace ful, seems to have been wholly based on a policy of compro mise. Of this I have already brought forward numerous instances, but what is perhaps the most striking proof of their determination to include in their system all possible shades of doctrine is shown in their attitude towards mother worship. I have already drawn attention to the great stress laid by ancient ritualists on continuity of worship, and this would appear to have been disregarded in the sacrifice to Rudra Triambakah, but this is certainly a wrong impression. Though the sacrifice was one performed with maimed rites, yet it only shows one side of the question, for, as shown in other places, in proofs already adduced and in others to be VOL.

The legends also tell of the great reverence paid to her as Satyavati the pos sessor of truth, and point to an early alliance between the Aryan Brahmins and the Nishadha or mother-worshipping tribes. But the most cogent proof that she was regarded as the god of gods, enshrined in the holy of holies, and only to be reverenced in solemn silence, and without the materialistic pomp of ceremony, is to be found in the Upanishads. There it is said that the divine syllable AUM is the most sacred invocation in the whole ritual, and this is merely a mute adoration of the three mothers. This is actually asserted in the Prasfia Upanishad, where AUM is said to represent the three Matras, A meaning the earth, AU the Soma world, i.e. that of the moon-worshippers, and AUM the light and the sun,1 i.e. the sun-worshippers ; and I have already shown that the earth, the moon, and the sun, were all originally goddesses. Evidence as to the Connection behveen the Worship of the Great Mother and the Measurement of Time. No account of the history of the evolution of religious belief, which began with the deification of the mother earth, would be complete without a proof of the connection between mother-worship and the measurement of time. I have gone so fully into the history of the origin of the mother's year of ten months in the Appendix, that I need not now discuss this part of the subject, and all that I shall do here is to point out how this earliest sacred period is especially con nected with the worship of the mother earth. I have already shown how in the sacred triad the moon-goddess took the central place, which was originally assigned to the bisexual 1 Prasfia Upanishad, v. 3-5 ; Max M tiller's translation Sacred Books of the East, vol. xii. p. 282.

Preface, p. 12.</page><page sequence="73">THE MOTHER AS MEASURER OF TIME. 391 power, and it was as a goddess that she continued to be regarded as the measurer of time. It was in this capacity that she was the especial patron of mothers, and presiding over child-birth was always thought to be one of the chief duties of the moon-goddess. It was doubtless as the guardian of the mother's year that the Latin Juno and the Greek Hera were originally regarded as supreme gods, and it is Sinivali the moon-goddess who is especially invoked in the Rigveda as the giver of children.1 But the connection between the serpent or linga-worship and the moon-goddess is most distinctly shown in the Brahmanas, in the rules laid down for two of the principal religious ceremonies in the Hindu ritual, the Agnyadhana or the consecration of the sacred household fires, and the great Soma sacrifice. Both these sacrifices are ordered to terminate with the recitation of a hymn of the Rigveda, called the Rik verses of Kadru the queen of the serpents, who is said in the ritual to be the earth.2 In the Agnyadhana ceremony this hymn is ordered to be muttered,3 and in the Soma sacrifice to be chanted inaudibly.4 These verses are said to be addressed to the sun-god; but if this were the case, they would have been chanted loudly, and not in a low voice like the invocations to Prajapati and the older gods;5 and it seems to me there can be no doubt that these verses are really addressed to the moon-goddess. The hymn is thus translated by Prof. Eggeling in his translation of the Satapatha Brahmana: 6 " Hither has come that spotted bull, and has settled down before the mother and before the father on going up to heaven. She (Grassmann translates He) moves along through the luminous spheres, breathing forth from his breath ; the mighty (bull) has illumined the sky. He rules over the thirty domains, and song is bestowed on the winged one, yea with light at break of day." 1 Rg. x. 184. 2, Sinivali is the name given to the new moon in the Aitareya Brahmana, 7. 2. 11, Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 458. 2 Rg.'x. 189 ; Sat.

Now the bull (or cow)l who illumines the sky and moves through the luminous spheres may either be the moon moving through the Nakshatras or the sun through the con stellations of the Zodiac. The sun could scarcely be called the spotted bull (or cow) by those who merely looked at it with their naked eyes, and had not seen it through a tele scope, whereas the epithet is one that would be readily applied to the moon. The lunar sacrificial animals are all black spotted with white, like the Egyptian bull Apis, the black-spotted goat sacrificed in the Hindu ritual to Soma,2 and the black-spotted spit-ox to Rudra.3 In the case of the moon the spots are reversed, being dark upon white; but the connection between the moon and spots is clear. But the reference to the song bestowed on the winged one gives still stronger proof that it is the moon-god who is addressed in this hymn. This certainly points to the legend which tells how the sacred falcon or eagle flew to Soma the moon and obtained thence the Gayatri metre, which he brought down from heaven.4 It is also the moon, and not the sun, which rules over the thirty spheres or stations, which are those of the moon in her monthly circuit round the heavens. I have shown fully in the Appendix that the original Nakshatras were the con stellations or stars traversed by the moon in her monthly course. There were twenty-eight, as long as the lunar years of ten first and thirteen months afterwards were the accepted measures of time, but they became thirty when, by the intro duction of the solar year, the month was made to contain thirty days. It is this number which, as I have shown, are used in the Sirozahs of the Zendavesta and the Babylonian Calendars, and in no case could the number of thirty stations be assigned to the passage of the sun through the signs of 1 There seems to be a doubt as to the gender.

But the connection between the number thirty and the worship of the mother earth is most clearly shown in the ritualistic use of one of the Vedic metres called the Viraj. This consists of thirty syllables or three times ten, and in the ritual of the animal sacrifice it is ordered that the hinder part of the altar shall be made thirty steps wide, as repre senting the Viraj metre.1 The reason given is that the altar means the woman, and must therefore be broader behind than in front, and the measurements assigned are thirty steps for the western or hinder side, twenty-four for the eastern, and thirty-six for the length. The interpretation to be given to the measurements is made certain by a second order in the ritual, immediately following the first, allowing the number of steps to be increased to thirty-three, the reason given being that there were two forms of the Viraj metre, one of thirty syllables and one of thirty-three syllables.2 I have already shown that the number thirty-three represents the thirty-three gods of the earliest year, based on the lunar months of twenty-eight days, which were the twenty-eight Nakshatras and the five seasons, and this being the case, the probability is that the thirty steps also refer to measures of time. But this is made certain by the numbers twenty four and thirty-six. The first represents a pair of solar years, which were necessary, according to the ritualistic view, to represent production, and the thirty-six represents the three strides of Vishnu and his conquest of the old triad under the symbol of a triad of years. But if the thirty steps represent measures of time, connected with the mother earth which is the altar, the question is as to what time is represented. The thirty steps, like the thirty stations in the 1 Sat. Brah. iii. 5. 1. 7 and 11, vol. xxvi. pp. 112-113. 2 Sat. Brah. iii. 5. 1. 8, vol. xxvi. p. 112.</page><page sequence="76">394 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. Vedic hymn, may mean the thirty days of the solar-lunar month, or they may, like the thirty-six, represent a complete triad of years. That this latter is the true interpretation is evident, when we consider that to the ritualists of the Brah manas the sacrifice, especially the great Soma sacrifice, for which this altar is made, is the year.1 These thirty steps must therefore represent the completed triad of the year of mothers, as the thirty-six steps is the complete triad of that of the gods of the sun-worshippers. They represent three sacred periods of ten months, or rather a triple consecration of one period of the same length to each of the three mothers, just as the year of twelve months was triply consecrated to Vishnu. We thus find the worship of the mother earth and of the three mothers interwoven with the earliest measures of time, and underlying the most sacred ceremonies of the Hindu ritual, the consecration of the altar for the great annual Soma sacrifice, the completion of that sacrifice, and the con secration of the household fires. But a further evidence of the original connection between the year and the universal mother is given by the name for year in some languages, especially in the Latin. The word for year, "annus," means a ring, which is the woman's symbol, and there can be no doubt that the earliest Roman year, to which the epithet of the ring was applied, was the year of ten lunar months, the period of gestation,2 which was looked on as the holy ring. 1 Sat. Bran. iii. 2, 2. 4, vol. xxvi. p. 37 ; i. 1. 1. 13, vol xii. p. 8. 2 With reference to this subject, I may note that I find it stated in Max Miiller's Preface to vol. iv. of his edition of the Rigveda, p. 69, that Ibn Ezra says that the Hebrew word " Shanah" means a ring, and the same great critic also argues that the Hebrew year must have been originally lunar, because " Chodesh," a month, is derived from a root meaning "to be new." Gesenius also connects Shanah with the Latin " annus," a ring, but a Hebrew scholar has pointed out to me that the root from which " Shanah " is derived involves the idea of repetition, recurrence, and that this may have produced the annular idea connected with the word. It certainly seems to have some connection with Sin, the moon, and so does the Greek euos, a year, where the aspirate may probably be connected with an initial s, and in that case both names would be derived from the moon. But neither of these two possible explanations is applicable to the Latin " annus " of ten months, which could not be said, like the completed year, to recur by beginning again when the ten months were ended.</page><page sequence="77">WIDE-SPREAD WORSHIP OF THE MOTHER EARTH. 395 Further Evidence as to the Worship of the Mothers and Fathers in Western Asia and Europe. In the previous references I have made to the worship of the mother earth in these countries, I have only spoken of it as connected with human sacrifices. But we find that not only was the mother earth worshipped as the one goddess, who was the mother of all beings, but also that three mothers were worshipped. These appear as the Erinyes of the Greeks and the Nomas of the Scandinavians, and the further fact that the triple division of the three mothers preceded the same division of the fathers, is shown by the original meaning of the three mothers being lost in the mists of early mythology, while the three fathers and the three tribes descended from them appear amongst all nations who have Aryan blood in their veins. We find also among the Jews, who probably are Arianized Arabs, Shem, Ham, and Japhet, with their descendants.1 The Greek tribes of Dorians, -ZEolians, and Ionians, and the three Roman tribes of Ramnes, Titicuses and Luceres may have a similar origin. But the worship of the three mothers, though it preceded the worship of the three fathers, only marks a somewhat late stage in evolution. The original worship was that of the mother earth, which continued till Greek history began, and long afterwards to be universally diffused throughout Western Asia and Europe. Among the Akkadians the earth was worshipped as Davki or Davkina. She was once, as Dr. Sayce shows, an independent goddess, but in the later ritual which he cites she was the wife of Hea the water snake-god.2 That is to say she was, like Ida the goddess, purified by the fertilizing waters of heaven, and stood to Hea in the same relation as Prithivi did to Indra in the Vedic mythology. To the people of Western Asia she was originally Cybele the mother earth, but under the reformation of the Indra or 1 Adah and Zillah certainly seem to represent two of the three mothers among the Jews, and the third may appear in Naamah ; see Appendix for the discussion of the question. If the division into three was not Aryan, it was the earliest division among the Turanians, and must have been connected with the sacred triad. Among the later Turanians five was the sacred number. 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 139.</page><page sequence="78">396 EARLY HISTORY OP NORTHERN INDIA. rather of the Hea worshippers, which penetrated to the coasts and islands of Asia Minor and Greece, she became the Cyprian Aphrodite, and the Aphrodite of the poets, who, like Ida in the legend of Manu, rose from the waters. The older earth goddess of the Greeks was Demeter, who always represented the mother earth. This same goddess was also worshipped in Egypt as Isis the mother, for though her name means in Egyptian the exalted venerable or ancient one, it is, as Prof. Tiele has pointed out, probably connected with the Akkadian Isi the earth.1 But though the coincidences between Indian and Greek ritualism, as shown in the successive changes in the worship of the universal mother, do not end here, yet space does not permit me to pursue this branch of the subject much further, and I will end by pointing out what is apparently the most remarkable coincidence of all, and one which seems to me to give almost conclusive proof that the original sacrifices to the mothers and fathers had both been established as the great festivals of the later autumn season, before the ances tors of the Hindus and Athenians separated from their common ancestral home. In the Brahmanas this sacrifice is ordered to be performed in Khartik,2 which was the last month but one of the ancient lunar year. But this month Khartik was the month dominated by the constellation of the Krittakas or Pleiades, and was especially sacred to the Semite-Akkadian worshippers of Vishnu. The connection between these people and the Krittikas is most conclusively shown in the arrangement of the Nakshatra, which were especially altered by them so as to make the year begin under the Nakshatra Krittika. We can, owing to the wonder ful discovery made by the acuteness of Mr. Bentley, give the exact date when this change took place.3 Mr. Bentley, in his researches into ancient Hindu astronomy, found in the Vayu and Linga Puranas a legend which told how Daksha 1 Tiele, Outlines of the History of Ancient Religions, pp. 48 and 58. 2 Sat. Brah. vol. xii.

BENTLEY'S DISCOVERY OF DATES. 397 gave his twenty-seven daughters, who were the twenty-seven Nakshatras, in marriage to the moon. Four of these daughters brought forth four of the planets : Rohini the planet Mercury, Magha Venus, Ashadha Mars, Parva phal guni Jupiter; whence Mercury was called Rohinya, Venus Maghabu, Mars Ashadhabhava, and Jupiter Parvi phalguni. This special connection between these planets and the Nak shatra months, occurring at different periods of the year, seemed to Mr. Bentley to represent some special astronomical relation between them and the moon. This connection he thought might be their occultation. He accordingly calcu lated back the places of the moon and these planets, and found that in the years 1425 and 1424 b.c. they were brought especially near to the moon's path, and that similar conjunc tions could not possibly have taken place since that time, nor for many thousands of years before. He thought, therefore, that these years must have some special connection with the arrangement of the Nakshatras, and he accordingly found that in the year 1426 b.c, or the year before these conjunc tions, which were called the birth of the planets, the vernal equinox took place in Khartik, and as the solar year began with the vernal equinox, this must have been the year in which the official list of the Nakshatras, beginning with the Krittikas, was drawn up.1 That this arrangement was made by the Vishnu-worshippers, or the Semite-Akkadians, who introduced the solar-lunar year, is proved by the fact that they hold the Diball, their special festival, which is to the people of Western India what the Durgapuja is to those of the East, on the new moon of that month, and it is then that they celebrate the beginning of the year, which was originally fixed at the time of the vernal equinox.2 But 1 Prof. Max Miiller obtained a verification of Mr. Bentley's calculations from Mr. Hind, of the Greenwich Observatory. Mr. Hind found that only Jupiter was occulted, though the others were in ecliptic conjunction with the moon. The several dates of these conjunctions were as follows : Venus, about August 20th, 1425 B.C.; Mercury, April 17th, 1424 b.c. ; Jupiter, April 22nd, 1424 b.c. ; and Mars, August 18th, 1424 b.c.?Preface to vol. iv. of his edition of the Rig veda, pp. 85-87. 2 But their original year is said by Alberuni, vol. ii. p. 9, Sachau's translation, to have begun in Mrigasirsha, when he says the year of the people of Sindh and Kanoj used to begin before it was altered to the new moon of Chait on the</page><page sequence="80">398 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. these people could not have been those who took their religion from northern sources, for the ruling constellation of the northern tribes was, as we know from the Zendavesta, the Hapto-iringas,1 the seven Rishis, the great Bear; and the people who were under the influence of the Pleiades must have been a more southern race, for all the civilization of India came only from two centres, from the Persian Gulf and the country of Iran on the north. But these people were also adorers of the great mother, for the leading star of the Pleiades is Amba.2 But that this transference of the autumn festival to the fathers, to Khartik, is one of the numerous changes in the ritual made by the Vishnu-worshippers, who made Vishnu the guardian of the year instead of Prajapati,3 is also proved by the fact that throughout Bengal and Eastern India the festival now is always held in the autumn. There the Durga puja takes place on the seventh day of the new moon of Asvin, and the festival of the Pitris or fathers ends on the new moon day preceding it, which ought to fall in the tenth month of Bhadon or Bhadrapada. But even this arrange ment does not take us back to the earliest ritual. The sanctity of the month of Asvin is a relic of the rule of the Kusikas or charioteers. It was to them that the Asvayajau or twin horsemen, whose names are preserved in the month, were sacred, and it is these twin horsemen whom we find regarded as deities throughout all ancient mythologies. The old name of the month of Assim or Asvayaja was Kuar, from Ku the earth, and this name is still universally nsed as that of this month throughout Central India.

There (Bhishma (Bhagavatgita) Parva, xxxiv. p. 115) Krishna (Vishnu) says, " I am Mrigasirsha," that is, that month is sacred to me. That means that he ruled the closing month of the lunar year which was formerly sacred to Siva, and it was at the end of this month that the new year began with the new moon of the succeeding month, Push. 1 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Sirozah, i. 13, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiv. p. 9, and many other places.

But even in Chuttisgurh we find an older system than that of the Haihayas; and there, as in Chota Nagpore, the festival to the sacred rice, the emblem of the mother earth, called the Gurhpuja, and that to the oxen representing the sacred bull and cow, called Pola, is held in Bhadon or Bhadrapada, in the tenth month l of the original year, which began in January at the time of the winter solstice. Now this same month was called by the Athenians Boedro mion, or the month of the course (Bpbfios) of the ox, and one of the Sanskrit names of the Hindu month is Proshthapadah, meaning the ox-footed month, which is therefore almost exactly the same as that of the Athenian month. It was also in this month that the Athenians held the festival of the Eleusinia, in honour of Demeter the mother earth, and it is also in this month that they held the festival of the Nekusia in honour of the fathers. Thus these Athenian festivals correspond precisely in point of time with the old Gurhpuja and Pola festivals to the mother earth and the ancestral bull or cow, and also to that of the festival to the Pitris in Bengal, and the references to the name of the ox in the month show that both the ancestors of the Hindus and of the Athenians must have regarded the ox as representing both the sacred bull and cow as most holy. The Worship of Female Gods and Matriarchal Pule earlier than the Worship of Male Gods and the Pule of the Fathers. If the conclusions arrived at in this discussion are correct, there is apparently no doubt that the worship of the great 1 These festivals are called the Pola and Gurhpuja. The information here given is taken from my official report on the Settlement of the Eaipore District, forming the southern part of Chuttisgurh. In the Gurhpuja the wild rice is gathered and hung up in the ryots' houses, thus securing the blessing of the mother earth on the house. This is strictly analogous to the blessing of the house at the consecration of the household fire by the recitation of the hymn of the Queen of the serpents, Kadru the mother earth.</page><page sequence="82">400 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. mother preceded that of the father or fathers of gods and men, and therefore the first female god could not be, as is supposed by Dr. Sayce, a Semitic addition to an earlier totem worship,1 but must have been a continuation of the earliest worship which succeeded that of local deities and totems, which was that of the one creative female principle. It is quite true, as Dr. Sayce says, that the Semite female deities are mere pale reflections of their lords, but the Semite did not create the female but placed the male gods, who were derived from the phallic gods of the linga-worshippers, above the old ancestral goddesses whose equals they had formerly been. The Semites were probably one of the earliest races who introduced into southern Asiatic countries family life and marriage, as opposed to the tribal life and the temporary unions for the benefit of the tribe, which were the leading features of the matriarchal rule. These customs they probably derived from their Aryan ancestors, for all the evidence tends to show that marriage was an original Aryan institution; and that the Semites are on one side at least of Aryan origin is proved by the inflexional forms in their grammar, which cannot be traced back to the agglutinative formations of the Turanian languages. As the Aryans are the only pure race in Europe and Asia who base their grammar on inflexions, it is most probable that they must be the ancestors of the Semites on one side, while on the other the Semites are descended from the aboriginal tribes of Arabia, who called themselves the sons of Ad. Evidence of the Official Recognition of the Phallic Gods as Gods of Time. Throughout the preceding discussion I have tried to show that one especial characteristic of the ruling gods of ancient nations was, that they were considered to be gods of time. I have shown that the moon-goddess, the heavenly mother, was the ruling god of the earliest year of ten months, and she was also the god ruling the full lunar year of thirteen. 1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 110.</page><page sequence="83">EVIDENCE OF A YEAR OF ELEVEN MONTHS. 401 But though I have nowhere found a year in actual use in which the male god is the ruling deity, there are throughout the Hindu sacrificial ordinances many traces which point to the existence of a year or sacred period of eleven months. In the official distribution of the functions of the thirty-three gods of time, we find eleven Rudras or phallic gods, and in the older animal sacrifice, which was the great yearly festival of the earliest ritualists, we find eleven victims offered. This sacrifice, as I have shown, represents the year, and in the Soma-sacrifice, in which this older sacrifice was merged, we find libations made to thirteen months of the year.1 It therefore seems to be most probable that the eleven victims were offered to the year of eleven months, which was the longest measure of time, besides the division into seasons, which was sacred to the united linga and mother-worshippers. In all the Apr! hymns except two there are only eleven stanzas, and as these are the official hymns prescribed for recitation at the great annual animal sacrifice, which repre sents the year, each of the stanzas must point to some division of the year. I have already shown that the first four and the last mean the five seasons; but if so, what do the other six mean ? The addition to the original five must mean some other division of the year, and this can only be the months, which are besides the seasons the only parts of the year recognized in the text of the ritualistic manuals. The two hymns, Pg. i. 13 and Rg. i. 142, which have more than eleven stanzas, have one twelve and the other thirteen, both of which agree with the number of months in two other official years, and therefore it is more than likely that the original sanctity of the number eleven stanzas was derived from a year or sacred period of eleven months.2 1 Sat. Brah. iv. 3. 1. 5 and 14-20, pp. 318, 321, 322. 2 Eleven is everywhere throughout the Brahmanas the number sacred to the older gods. In the Soma annual sacrifices there are eleven fore-offerings fpra yajas), eleven by-offerings (upayajas), and eleven after-offerings (anuyajas) (Sat. Brah. iii. 8. 4 and I, vol. xxvi. p. 310; Ait. Brah. ii. 18, Haug's translation, p. 110). Sacrifices on eleven potsherds are offered to Prajapati at the Varuna praghasa or summer seasonal sacrifice (Sat. Bruh. ii. 5. 2. 39, vol. xii. p. 403), and the same number to Agni-Soma at the new and full moon sacrifice (Sat. Brah. i. 6. 3. 14, vol. xii. p. 167). The thirty-three, or three times eleven, offerings at the Soma sacrifice distinctly point to the number eleven being one of the</page><page sequence="84">402 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. Moreover, in the original ritual only one mother was wor shipped, and the addition of the other two, Ida and Sarasvati, who were included in the hymn, point to the subsequent addition of two mothers, to make up the full number of thirteen months of the full lunar year. These two mothers must have been added by the northern immigrants, the sons of Kus, who, as I have tried to show in the Appendix, probably introduced the full lunar year of thirteen months; but this addition was made long before the worship of Ida, the purified mother, or of Sarasvati, the mother of the Aryans, was thought of in India, and before the tribes who are identified with these ancestral mothers had arrived in the country. But in this year of eleven months the ruling god must have been the father, and this conclusion is confirmed by the last verse of the Apr! hymns being dedicated to Agni Svishtakrit or Rudra the phallic god, and it was as the ruler of the year of eleven months that he first obtained official recognition, and it was thus he secured his place in the popular triad of which Brahma, who was formerly Pushkara the moon-goddess, and Vishnu are the other members, as the rulers of the full lunar and of the lunar-solar year. Historical Evidence as to the Origin of Phallus Worship. In the previous essays of the present series I have brought forward overwhelming evidence to prove the universal diffu sion throughout Northern India of snake and linga-worship. All the ruling races were descended from snake-gods, and the great snake Nahusha was, before the days of the worship divisions used in reckoning the gods of time, and this conclusion is confirmed by the thirty-three gods being in the Rigveda divided into three groups of eleven each (Bg. i. 34. 11; i. 139. 11; viii. 35. 3 ; ix. 92. 4). This division corresponds to the thirty-six steps given as the length of the altar, and the thirty and thirty three steps as its breadth. I have already shown that the thirty-six steps denote the threefold reverence paid to the year of twelve months, the thirty steps to the same honours given to the year of ten, and it hence follows that the thirty-three steps, the thirty-three offerings, and the division of the thirty-three gods into three groups of eleven each, all point to a year of eleven months. Thus in the official division of the thirty-three gods into eleven Ruclras, eight Vasus, and twelve Adityas, we have the two sacred years of eleven and twelve months, united by the seven sacred days of the week, with the sun-god added.</page><page sequence="85">ORIGIN OF THE NAME VIRATA. 403 of Indra, the ruler of heaven and earth.1 But I have now I hope proved that the worship of the great mother was long anterior to that of the snake father, and as the worship of any god as the supreme deity meant in primaeval times that the tribe who regarded that god with especial reverence were the chief rulers of the country, the worship of the mother earth and the snake father, which have been so deeply rooted in all the national and religious traditions of India, must imply that the mother-worshippers and snake worshippers were two races of differing origin, each of which ruled the country for many centuries. I shall in a later part of this essay try to show to what race the mother worshippers belonged; but I shall first try to show the ethnology of the snake-worshippers. Their chief god must have been the universal father, and he appears as the snake god Nahusha, and in the Brahmanas as Rudra or Piishan, the sacred bull of the Indra-worshippers. In the Mahabharata he is Vichittra Vlrya, the reputed father of the Kauravya and Pandava, the black and fair races. But the best evidence as to the race to which the original snake-worshippers be longed is to be found in a consideration of the questions connected with the origin of the Virata, who were the great rulers of Western India known to the writers of the Rigveda and the later Sanskrit writers by the name of Matsya or Haihayas, a name which they acquired, as I have already shown, when they became worshippers and sons of the fish god Hea. In Part II. of this series of essays I suggested that the name Virata might be another form of Bharata.2 Further inquiry has now shown me that this opinion is probably erroneous, and I now hope to prove that, as the Bharata are probably the descendants of the worshippers of the great mother, called in the Rigveda Mahi or Bharati, so the Virata are the descendants of the great snake first, afterwards of Hea the fish-god, and finally of Ida the purified mother, who appears as their ancestress in the Rigveda. 1 Nahusha was hurled from heaven by Indra.

Oppert, in a learned work on the original inhabitants of Bharatavarsha (India), which he is now publishing in the Madras Journal of Literature and Science, gives an interest ing description, taken from the Mackenzie Manuscripts, of the way in which the Idaiya Kurumbas of Madras worship their god Virubhadra (the blessed or holy Viru).1 This god Viru is a representative of Siva, and the name Idaiya appears to connect these Kurumbas, with the Iravata, who were the worshippers of the snake-god Hea, and also of Ida or Ira as the sacred bull or cow. The name Viru is clearly the dis tinctive name of the god, bhadra being merely a honorific title. Viru is undoubtedly the same word as Viru, which appears in the name Viru-paksha, the collection (paksha) of Viru-worshippers, used as that of one of the snake-worship ping races in Eastern India in the Chullavagga,2 and both names point to the worship of the Viru or the " linga." Now these Kurumbas are a tribe of shepherds and hunters, very widely distributed everywhere throughout Madras, both in the Tamil and Telugu countries. They once ruled the whole of Southern India, and were especially power ful in Vizianagram, which is the Kalinga country near the mouth of the Godavery.3 Their original god was the upright stone, which was the earliest representation of the " linga" ; and besides Virubhadra they worship the great mother, united with the male principle under the name Viru Lukshmi. Sakti-worship, or the worship of the female principle, exists among them, and their religion is material istic, and shows the union between the worshippers of the mother earth and the linga-worshippers. Among this people are to be found a tribe of cultivating Kurumbas, whom Dr. Oppert identifies with the Kurmis or Kudumbis,4 and he also shows the similarity of their customs with those of the 1 G.

These southern Kudumbis or Kurmis must have been an offshoot of the great Kuru race, who were once the ruling power in Northern India, and who under their god Kutsa, called in the Rigveda the charioteer of Indra, conquered the Gandharvas or the northern charioteers of the Kabul valley.4 They were the sons of Yima Khshaeta, the good shepherd of the Zendavesta, who replenished the earth with flocks and herds, and sowed the seeds from which future generations of men, women, and animals were to spring in the sacred Vara or Garden of God.5 He was the successor of Haoshyanga the Paradhata, and the immediate predecessor of Keresaspa, the Hindu Kasyapa, and of Thrae taona, the slayer of the snake-god Dahaka.6 It was these people who, first as shepherds and afterwards as agricultu rists, came down from the north, where they acquired that knowledge of irrigation which has made the Kurmis the best farmers, the most skilful irrigators, and the most persistent diggers of tanks and makers of reservoirs in India. It was this people who used the streams to fertilize the land, threw embankments across valleys in hilly countries, dug wells in those where the rainfall was scanty, and made tanks where the country was flat and the rainfall copious. It was their god Kutsa who vanquished Shushna the demon of drought, and it was they who, as the Virata or worshippers or sons of Viru, laid the foundations of the great empire of Western 1 lb. pp. 210, 239. 2 J.R.A.S.

Perhaps this refers to the institution of the lunar year, which is, in the Zendavesta (Fargard i. 10, Sacred Books of the East, vol. iv. p. 7), represented by the conquest of the Gandarewas or Pairikas, the wandering stars, by Keresaspa, the Zend Kutsa and by his making the Pairika kiiathaiti, the moon-goddess, his wife.

India, and gave a fresh stimulus to the export trade from the western ports, which had already been established by the mother-worshippers, the earliest immigrants. The people who first learnt how to cultivate and manufacture indigo, to grow and weave cotton, to rear the plants which yield dyes, and to utilize the sugar-cane, must have formed a most powerful and progressive section of the inhabitants of the great empire, the power of which was based on its internal and foreign trade ; and it is not to be wondered at that the country was named after these enterprising pioneers of pro gress, and called Virata, the home of the sons of Viru their god.1 But these people, whose god was the great father, could not have been a nation who looked on the matriarchate as the ideal form of government, and to them the father as the head of the household must have been the typical ruler, and it is both in the Brahmanas and the Zendavesta that we find the introduction of family life ascribed to a northern people, who eat barley and who were shepherds and fire-worshippers. In the Satapatha Brahmana mankind were said to be de livered from Varuna's noose through conjugal union, (1) by the fires on the two altars to the heavenly and earthly gods, (2) by the curds offered to Indra, and (3) by the ram and ewe sacred to Varuna, which were made of barley meal, Varuna's grain, and offered at the Varuna praghasa.2 Now the fire-god and Indra were, as I have shown, later objects of worship than the god of the linga, the father of all beings. But it is in the Zendavesta that we find the most distinctive intimation that it was the shepherds who first introduced family life, and were the first worshippers of the great father. This is given in the Ashi Yast recited to the goddess Ashi Vanguhi. Ashi Vanguhi is the goddess who 1 I must not, in this short summary of some of the leading conquests of early agricultural science, be considered to attribute them to the earliest ancestors of the farming races. They must, like all other discoveries, have been the work of many successive generations, who all owed their origin to ancestors who first imbued their descendants with the spirit of inquiry and perseverance, which has continued down to the present time to animate those who followed in the track of their fathers. 2 Sat.

They must have been the mountain shepherds of Central Asia, who first formed herds of the mountain sheep and goats, and it was they who first introduced animal sacrifices as substitutes for the human sacrifices of the matri archal tribes. They are the Kauravya among the early snake races, the Dhritarashtra or Bharata denoting the earlier matriarchal tribes, and as linga-worshippers were the first framers of the rude sacrificial ritual in which the linga, as well as the earth, was fertilized by the blood of the sacrifice, and it was they who introduced the year of eleven months. Historical Evidence as to the Races which Succeeded the Linga- Worshippers. In the several analyses of the sacrificial forms accompany ing certain sacrifices which have been given in the earlier part of this essay, I have shown that the moon-god was at a very early period looked on as the ruling goddess among the gods of generation, but that she was also the ruling god of the full lunar year. That this year was introduced by the people called the sons of Kus or Kasyapa I think I have fully proved in the Appendix, and what is here to be con sidered is the race to which these people belonged. Kasyapa is in the Mahabharata the son of Marichi, meaning black pepper,2 and his counterpart in the Zendavesta, Keresaspa, is 1 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Ashi Yast x., Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiv. pp. 280,282. 2 Adi (Sambhava) Parva, lxv. p. 185.</page><page sequence="90">408 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. the son of Sama, and the brother of Urvakhshaya, the great law-giver. Keresaspa extended his conquests to the Rangha or Tigris,1 and killed the snake Srvara and the Gandharva,2 but his original kingdom was in the Pishin valley in Kabul, where he is to sleep till the day of judgment.3 They were the people who are known as Asvapati or Asvaka or lords of the horse, and were the Kusikas or charioteers. It was they who made the full lunar year, the months of which are said in the Mahabharata to be the thirteen wives of Kasyapa. They were the race called Takshakas, or builders, among the five snake races of India, and the sons of Cain and of Tubal-Cain of the Biblical narrative. They were the city builders and handicraftsmen, who are the people of the later Stone age and early Bronze age of anthropologists. Through out the Mahabharata they are represented as rulers of the Northern Punjab, in alliance with the Gandhari or Scythians of the Kabul valley, who had succeeded them as rulers of that country, and they were the Vaikarna or Kuru Takshakas and the Purus or city builders of the Rigveda.4 They were in India the founders of the great western cities of Pushkara vatl, the moon-city, on the Swat river, and Kasyapura, the modern Multan. In the east they founded the great city of Kasi or Benares, which means the city of the Kasi, and their name is also found in that of the famous city of Kusi-nagara, the city (nugur) of the Kasis, in which the Buddha died. It was these Kasis, allied with the Malli or Kolarian tribes, who ruled one of the sections of the Vaggian confederacy, composed of eighteen tribes of Licchavis, whose capital was at Vaisali, and of eighteen tribes of Malli, whose capital was Kusinagara. These Malli seem to have been a mixed people formed from three united races, the Kolarian tribes, the mother-worshippers, and the Kasis. In the names of the two months succeeding Bhadrapada or Proshthapada, we find evidence of the connection of those 1 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Ram Yast vii.

The month Assin or Asvayujau is manifestly derived from them, and Khartik, the month dominated by the Pleiades, must, as I have already shown, have been named by a pre-Aryan race. But while the name Khartik is shown by the Tamil list of the monthsl to belong to an earlier series, that of Assin or Asvayujau, which is Alpesi or Arpesi in Tamil, is of later origin. The earlier name of this month must have been Kuar, from ku 'the earth/ and this was probably the name of what was originally the eleventh month. It must have represented the male earth god in the year of eleven months. The twin horsemen, who appear to have represented first the mother and father,2 and afterwards the day and the night, were the special gods of the charioteers or northern horsemen, and stand outside the religious system founded on triads, and are represented in early legends as reformers. It was they who, in the legend of Chyavana, restore the day worn out and decrepit, through the darkness of the night, to the freshness of his early youth, and bring back the son of Budju (the daylight), who had been sunk in the waters by his enemies, to the light of day.3 They were the twin brethren of Roman mythology, the Castor and Pollux of the Greeks, and would seem to be the two gods added to the original eleven gods of time to make up the full number of thirteen required to complete the full lunar year.4 But besides the pair of heavenly horsemen, there was another pair worshipped by the men of this age. This wras the pair of fire-sticks. It was the handicraftsmen and the workers in metals who must first have deified fire, and it is these people who must have substituted the fire-god for the 1 In Tamil it is Kartikai. 2 See Appendix.

It is this people who must have substituted burnt offerings for the unburnt sacrifices of the earlier worshippers, and made the fire the agent to carry up the sacrifice to the gods. In the history of sacrifices we find everywhere first the unburnt sacrifice, which is divided into morsels to fertilize the land cultivated by the sacrificers, then the linga, as well as the earth fertilized by the blood of the victim; while in the third stage, after the animal has been slain and the blood poured on the earth and sprinkled on the temple and the altar, the flesh is burnt with fire.1 The whole period marks a time of great intellectual activity, during which improved methods in agriculture, and in the manual arts, were being everywhere introduced, and this progress is further shown in the advance of astronomical science, and in the adoption of the lunar year of thirteen months, or 864 days, which approached very near to the actual length of the year. It was the age which by the Greek mythologists was represented as the age of Chiron the Centaur, who, according to Hesiod, instructed Achilles, the solar hero, and to Xenophon, the solar gods Apollo and Diana, in the rules of justice, and in the art of hunting. Others name Chiron as teaching music, the art of the lyre, and medicine, and place him before ^Esculapius.2 Evidence as to the Races who introduced Indra-Worship and destroyed the Snake and Linga Gods. The First Stage of Indra Worship. This great religious change, which appears to have been regarded by all the nations who received their religion from the Euphrates valley as a flood which killed all the wicked snake-worshippers, must certainly have been the work of a people who were influenced by a totally different set of ideas from those which dominated the minds of the early religious 1 This is the process prescribed in the Jewish ritual, and the northern nations used also to redden their altars and temples with the blood of the sacrifices, St. Olaf, Hermskungla 113 ; Du Chaillu, The Viking Age, vol. i. chap. xx. p. 345. 2 Lewis, Historical Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients, p. 75 ; Hes.

This change is expressed in the Sata patha Brahmana by saying that the gods left earth and went to heaven, being taken there by the sacrifice;l in other words, the explanation of the mysteries of creation was looked for in the heavens, instead of on the earth, and it was from this time that the heavenly gods were regarded as the supreme rulers, and it was the ruler of the heavens who issued laws for the earth and for all that were on it. This revolution began with fire-worship, and was continued by those who proceeded to look on the god of the fertilizing waters rather than the fire-god as the chief god. It appears to have originated, as I have before suggested, in a country where seasonal rains were liable to be frequently stopped by droughts, and in the eyes of the worshippers of the god of the creator of life, it was he who was the heavenly power who defeated the snake-god, the fiend of drought, the Shushna of the Rigveda, and the Deva Apaosha of the Zendavesta.2 The conflict between the two enemies is represented in the Zend avesta as a battle between the white horse, Tistrya the dog star, and the black horse, representing the fiend. This is a confirmation of the evidence which ascribes the change to the northern horsemen, and in Tistrya the dog-star we find, as I shall show later, on the fire-god.3 But this was not the god of the earthly fire worshipped by the Takshakas and handicraftsmen under the symbol of the two fire-sticks, but the god of the heavenly fire, who thus took the place which had been already taken by his earthly prototype, who had claimed to be the real author of the power formerly ascribed to the earthly father, the god of the linga. But this trans formation of the gods from earthly to heavenly beings did not end here. The deification of the heavenly fire, like the original fire-worship, was probably, as I shall show, the work of the Northern Akkadians. But a similar change also took place among the Sumerians or the Southern race. The snake * Sat.

The moon-goddess was no longer Sinha the mother of the sons of Sindhu, but Pushkara the goddess, resting like the divine lotus upon the life-giving waters, and the maker of Push the bull, while Kadru or Amba the earthly mother became Satyavati, the possessor of truth, and Ida, the mother purified by the waters of heaven. The Virata, the sons of Viru the phallic god, became Haihaya or sons of Hea the fish-god, and Iravata the sons of the sacred Ida. Among the Jews the holy people became the sons of Shem, (The name)1 whose connection with the older moon-god is shown in the sacred EJJ, its initial letter representing the sacred trident, the ancient symbol of the heavenly triad, which had been adopted as the emblem of the sacred fire-stick. I have already shown how these three sacred marks were sanctified in the deification of the ox, the animal with the cloven or triad foot ;2 and the transfer of sanctity to the ox is further shown in the Hindu month Bhadrapada or Proshtapada, the ox-footed month. The dominant of this month is Aja Ekapad the one-footed god, or the sacred fire-stick, the olhiirovs or swollen-footed god of the Greeks, who afterwards became the goat fish-god, represented by a goat with a fish's tail. Thus it was among the Iravata or worshippers of the heavenly fire that the ox replaced the goat as the animal sacred to the moon-goddess.3 1 Shem means The name. 2 Part III. J.R.A.S. July, 1889, p. 546, note 2. 3 Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, chap. lxi. vol. ii. p. 122. This sub stitution of the ox for the goat is shown in the adoption of Ahir Budhneya, the dominant god of the second Nakshatra of this month. Ahir Budhneya is explained in the Aitareya Brahmana, iii. 27, Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 224, to mean the household fire. But Ahir is, as every one in India knows, one of the names of the cattle-herding tribes, and the god called Ahir must be the ox-footed god. Thus Bhadrapada, the blessed foot, was the name of the goat-god, Proshtapada or the ox-footed, the name of the later god. This difference between the domin ants of the two halves of the month arises from a difference of race, and a similar difference is apparently shown in the names of the Nakshatras of the month, the first Purvabhadrapada would be the Nakshatra of the eastern (Purva) people, who worshipped the goat, and whose year was the lunar year of thirteen months, and Uttarabhadrapada was the Nakshatra of the northern (Uttara) tribes, who had adopted the solar year. I have shown in the Appendix that the use of the Nak</page><page sequence="95">THE ARRIVAL OF THE SONS OF SARASVATI. 413 But though all these changes which marked the earlier phases of Indra-worship must have occupied a vast period of time, they do not seem to be the work of a race essentially distinct from the earlier mother and linga-worshippers. They were all made by the sons of Manu the thinker, the father of the black races of the Rigveda, and of the Kauravya or black races formed by the union between the mother worshippers, the Virata or linga-worshippers, and the sons of Kus or Kasyapa the Dhritarashtra or Bharata, the Kauravya and Takshaka among the Hindu snake races. It was these people who were regenerated by the new doctrines, but before they could be fully developed they had to be translated into words ; till these thoughts, breathed in burning words, were thus touched with the sacred fire, they were not thought by the sons of Sarasvati, the goddess of speech, to be life giving and productive. Till they were thus consecrated the real effects of the change which had been begun could not be worked out. An Aaron who could speak was wanted to interpret the thoughts of Moses, who was slow of speech and slow of tongue.1 This final development of the work of this ancient revolutionary era was undertaken in India by the Aryans, and the Northern races allied with them, who called themselves the sons of Sarasvati.2 Second Stage of Indra- Worship. I have in the previous pages of this essay shown the great alterations in the ritual made by the Indra-worshippers ; but I have not yet described the two great changes which give unequivocal historical proof of the lasting marks left in India by the great Scythian invasion which ushered in the period of the supremacy of the Aryans, who were from the first their intimate allies. These are the introduction of the shatras as parts of the year was caused by the adoption of a five years' cycle, to include solar and lunar years, and this evidence ol the intermixture of northern and eastern or new and old world gods, in the names and dominant gods of the several Nakshatras, is additional proof of the truth of the account of the origin of the Nakshatra which I have there given. 1 Exodus iv. 10-17. 2 Part II.

Asvamedha or horse sacrifice, and the great addition made to the great annual festival to Sinha the moon-goddess, by making the worship of Soma, the divine drink, the leading feature in the ritual. I have already shown in this survey of the historical evidence that the mother-worshippers were in the list of ruling snake races called the Dhritarashtra or Bharata, the linga-worshippers, the Kauravya or Virata, the sons of Kus, the Takshakas, the earlier Indra-worshippers, the Iravata, and we now come to the Vasuki. These are, as I have already shown, the worshippers of the snake-god Yasu. But besides the one god Yasu, there are also seven Yasus, who represent the seven days of the week. Now in the older measurements of time the days of the week do not appear as sacred, that is, they were not, as I have shown in the Appendix, officially recognized as units of time measure ment. The earliest evidence I have yet found showing the recognition of the week is the list of the days of the month with the gods to which they were sacred, which were found in the library of Assurbanipal. In this list every seventh day is a day of rest, and this sanctity attached to one day in the week is in the Zendavesta extended to the first seven days of the month, which include the day sacred to Ahura Mazda, and are called the Amesha Spenta or Amhaspands.1 It was evidently the same people who consecrated the seven days of the week who consecrated the seven Yasus in India, and it was this same people who, as I shall shortly show, introduced the Soma ritual. Throughout the whole of the Brahmanas there is evidently a constant oscillation going on between five and seven as the sacred numbers. Five is, as I have shown, the sacred number of the Southern people, who divided the year into five seasons, while seven would appear to be the sacred number of the Northern tribes. As an instance I may notice the seven potsherds offered to the Marutah Kridinah, the special companions of Indra, in the Sakamedha sacrifice.2 It was these worshippers of the gods 1 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Sirozah, 1.1, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiv. p. 3, also p. 6, note 11. 2 Sat.

It was these people who divided their year into three seasons, and it was under their rule that the three seasonal festivals, the Vaisvadeva, the Varuna-praghasah, and the Sakamedha, the spring, summer, and autumn festi vals, were introduced. The Asvamedha or Horse Sacrifice. This was the special and peculiar sacrifice of the Saka or Scythian tribes. In India it has always been considered to be the offering due to the gods by victorious conquerors, and the performance of a horse sacrifice was the sign by which a conquering king proclaimed his title to rule over a large number of subordinate states. But the reverence shown to the horse in Hindu ritual is not confined to this sacrifice, but appears also in the honours paid to it in other most important ceremonies. The horse is named as second to man among the sacrificial animals;l and in the ritual for the establishment of the sacred household fire (Agnyadhana), the sacrificer is directed to procure a horse or an ox, but preferably a horse, and to lead it up to the fire, while the priest touches the foot-prints with the burning fire-wood three times, addressing an invocation to earth, air, and heaven.2 But this ceremony is clearly a transformation made by the Saka priests of one in the Soma sacrifice. In the Soma sacrifice the priest fills the seventh foot-print of the Soma cow as she passes into the consecrated ground with butter, saying, as he pours the sacred butter, " On Aditi's (i.e. earth's) head I pour thee, on the worshipping ground of the earth, and thou art Ida's foot-prints filled with butter."3 1 Sat.

It was this earlier ceremony in honour of the earth wThich was taken over by those who framed the rites for the conse cration of the household fire; but they substituted the horse for the cow, and the sacred fire for the butter of the material istic ritual. That this custom of sacrificing horses was, like that of strangling the victim, a Scythian one, is proved by Herodotus, who says that the Scythians sacrificed more horses than any other animals.1 This same custom is con tinued by the Ugro-Finnic Yoguls, who, as Eeguly informs us, still sacrifice the horse.2 The Soma Sacrifice. It is in this sacrifice that we find the most distinct traces of the influence exercised by the Saka and Iranian races over the course of religious evolution. I have already shown how the Soma or Haoma, the divine drink, is -associated with the Sakas in Darius's inscriptions, and similar evidence is given in the Satapatha Brahmana. The story of the descent of Soma from heaven, as told there, is as follows. The sacred bird Suparni, the Gadura of the Mahabharata, and the falcon who brought the Gayatri metre and the spirit of poesy from heaven, was sent by Kadru, the mother earth, to fetch Soma, the heavenly drink. Soma was under the charge of the Gandharvas, or Soma-warders, and it was from them that the sacred bird took it; and when it arrived on earth, it was Indra and Agni who preserved it for the protection of creatures.3 These Gandharvi were the people to whom the horse was sacred, and were the same as the Gandhari, the Scythian tribes of Northern Asia, and the Indra who preserved it was not the first Indra, the counterpart of Hea the fish-god, but the later Indra called Sakra or Sakko, the warrior-god of 1 Herod, iv. 61. 2 J.R.A.S. Vol. XXI. "On the Ugor Branch of the Ural-Altaic Family of Languages," by Theodore Duka, p. 623. The custom of sacrificing horses still continues among people of Hindu origin, and strange to say an instance of it occurred two years ago at Chertsey, when a gypsey chief died, and the tribe sacrificed a horse over his grave. The horse was probably originally sacrificed for the use of the dead in the other world; but when the horse was introduced into the Hindu ritual, he became, like any other sacrifice, a ransom for the sacrificer. 3 Sat. Brah. iii. 6. 2. 6-12, vol. xxvi. pp. 150-157.</page><page sequence="99">IRANIAN ORIGIN OF SOMA SACRIFICE. 417 the Sakas. This legend tells us in a mythical form how the sacred messenger of the gods brought to earth the divine drink, which was the latest form of the creative essence, which had been held to reside in the god of the linga, the fire-god, and the god of the fertilizing waters. The sacrifice was like that to the moon, to which it was added in the ritual of the Brahmanas, a yearly one, and was clearly derived from the annual Scythian festival described by Herodotus, in which each year the chief of the tribe at the annual festival gave cups of wine to those who had during the year slain enemies in battle.1 But this rude rite had, by the time the sacrifice reached India, been altered by the Iranian ritualists, and become the sacrifice described in the Zendavesta as offered " by the holy Zarathustra in the Airyana Vaejah, by the good river Daitya, with the Haoma and meat, with the baresma, with the wisdom of the tongue, with the holy spells, with the speech, with the deeds, with the libations, and the rightly-spoken words." 2 When this sacrifice was brought to India, the chief place in the great annual festival was assigned to the moon goddess, who ruled over the lunar year of thirteen months introduced by the Takshakas or sons of Kus; but this sacrifice had been an addition to the earliest annual festival, in which eleven animal victims were slain in honour of the earlier year of eleven months, and these animals had been originally slaughtered after the manner of the fathers, in which they were tied to the yupa or sacrificial stake, representing the linga, and stabbed behind the ear, so that the blood spirted over the sacred stake, fertilizing it and the mother earth into 1 Herod, iv. 66. 2 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Aban Yast, xxiv. 104, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiv. p. 78.

In Fargard iii. 1. the mortar for bruising the Soma, the pressing stone of the Hindu ritual, is described as one of the sacrificial implements of the holy sacrifice. The holy wood is also included in this list, showing that the Soma sacrifice of the Zoroastrians included, like the Hindu Soma sacrifice, a burnt offering. The "baresma," which was originally a single twig, the divining rod of Rabdomancy, became afterwards a bundle of twigs, as shown by Prof. Darmesteter in his note quoted above.</page><page sequence="100">418 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. which it was fixed. This ancient ritual of the Kauravyas or Yirata was also based upon an older sacrifice, in which the animal was killed by a blow on its forehead, and sacrificed to the mother earth on unconsecrated ground. The Aryanized Scythians, who brought the later Soma sacrifice into the country, also introduced the Scythian method of killing the sacred victims by strangling them. The sacrifice to the moon-goddess was quite distinct from that to the eleven victims offered at the great animal sacrifice. To this latter the central place of honour was assigned, and the sacrifice to the moon-goddess was first in order, while the Soma libation closed the rites. But in the earlier stages of the sacrifice the later Soma worshippers altered the old ritual, so as to make it appear that the initial as well as the closing ceremonies were performed in honour of the later Soma, the god of the divine drink; but there is little difficulty, when once the clue is found, in understanding what were the addi tions to the original ceremony, as every stage shows that it was to the moon-goddess that the sacrifice was first offered. When Soma is brought to the sacrificial ground, it must first be bought, to represent the sale supposed to have been originally made by the Gandharvas. The price to be paid for it is a she-goat, which is said to be the most fertile of animals.1 The bundle of Soma-plants, when brought, is wrapped in a shining white cloth.2 It is then placed in the cart which is to carry it to the sacrificial ground on a black antelope skin, representing Aditi the mother earth,3 and the cart, to which two oxen are harnessed, is drawn to the sacri ficial ground. But before the Soma enters the consecrated area, a black spotted he-goat must be offered to Agni and Soma, and this sacrifice is offered to redeem the sacrificer himself. When this offering has been made, the white wrapper is taken off the Soma plants, and they are placed on the throne of Udumbara wood, and brought into the hall as seed for the sacrificer.4 1 Sat.

In the first place, the wrapping of the Soma plants in a shining white cloth shows that in the original sacrifice Soma meant the moon, and this is more distinctly shown by the fact that a she-goat was given as a price for the later Soma. It was most probably this she-goat which was originally brought to the sacrifice with the sacred moon-plants,1 and the whole sacrifice probably signified a union between the heavenly moon-goddess, the earth, and the phallic god. The goat is among all nations the animal especially sacred to the moon god. In Assyria the supreme goat Azuga-Suga was sacred to Mul-lil, the deposed moon-god.2 In Egypt the Mendesian goat was sacred to Osiris, whose earliest name was Thut the moon-god.3 In Italy goats were sacrificed at the Lupercalia to Innuus a moon-god,4 and in Athens goats were offered to Artemis a moon-goddess.5 But though the goat was the animal which was, from the very earliest times, sacred to the moon-goddess, there was another victim which was dedicated to her service at a still earlier time. This was the gazelle, the animal sacred to Mul-nugi, the ancient Akkadian moon god, which was the animal consecrated by the people of the Euphrates valley, who selected the animal who roamed over the wide plains of the Euphrates and Tigris as that which was especially sacred to the moon. It is this animal which is represented by the skin of the black antelope, which was the Indian gazelle of the Gangetic valley. This is said to represent the mother earth, which shows that the original worshippers of the mother earth came from the wide plains watered by the Euphrates and Tigris, for the gazelle and antelope both only live on plains. But the most cogent evidence proving that Soma, the divine drink, was originally Soma or rather Sinha, the moon, is to be found in the libations offered to the months during 1 Plants sacred to the moon, such as the mistletoe of the Druids. 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 286. 3 Part III.

These were originally offered to the moon, and formed the conclusion of the sacrifice, which was first a sacrifice to the mother earth, represented here by the black antelope skin, the great father or phallic god, and the moon-goddess ruling the year. These libations are drawn from the Dronakalsa or Soma trough, which represents Prajapati, and Prajapati is the year.1 Prajapati (the lord of created beings) is, as I have shown before, the old moon-god, and the name seems to have been given to him as uniting in himself the creative force originally conceived as the supreme deity under the separate forms of the phallic god, the moon-god, and the god of the fire-stick; and as repre senting the creator under these various forms, he is called in the Varuna Praghasa or summer sacrifice the great Ka or Who?2 He is throughout the Brahmanas, as I have before shown, said to represent the year and the sacrifice which is the year,3 and from this position he was driven by Vishnu, who is said also to represent the year and the sacrifice.4 Thus Prajapati or Soma or Sinha is the moon-god ruling the lunar, and Vishnu is the sun-god ruling the solar-lunar year. These libations to the months were drawn by the Accha vaka priests. These are the representatives of the old priests who had, under the Ghandharvas or Kusikas, the charge of Soma. It was they who yielded up Soma to Suparni, the divine bird of song, and because they were faithless to their charge, they were at first excluded from drinking Soma.5 But they were retained as sacrificial priests by Indra and Agni, and were allowed to drink Soma after reciting a verse to Agni, the god of help.6 They also received a piece of the sacrificial cake, which in the Brahmanical ritual represented the animal sacrifice.7 They were clearly the old non-Aryan 1 Sat.

They were retained by the later worshippers of Agni and Indra, and still performed the duty of distribu tion in drawing and handing round the Soma cups. The duties of the Acchavaka priest in drawing these liba tions are thus described in the Satapatha Brahmana: " Let him draw twelve of them, twelve months there are in the year, therefore he should draw twelve (cups of Soma), but he may also draw thirteen, for they say there is a thirteenth month. Let him nevertheless draw twelve, for such is com pleteness." l In another place it is said there are twelve or thirteen months in the year.2 But in spite of the hesitation in the instructions, thirteen cups are required to be taken, for in naming the months a cup for Amhaspati, the thirteenth month, is ordered to be drawn and drunk by the Acchavaka priest.3 Historical Evidence as to the Sdka Invasion and Pule. I have already, in a previous part of this paper, referred to the evidence in the Rigveda as to the alliance between the Sakas or Chitraratha and the Aryans or Arna, shown in the account of the battle in which they were defeated by the Yadu Turvasus on the banks of the Sarayu,4 the modern Sutlej. But there is another legend in the Vajasaneya and Taittlriya Samhitas, which shows that these worshippers of the horse had extended their power over the countries of the Gangetic Doab. In this story the three mothers, Amba, Ambika, and Amvalika, who were there said to be queens in Kampilya, the capital of the Panchala country, remonstrate against being obliged to sleep with the horse.5 This is 1 Sat.

Further evidence of the Saka invasion is given in the history of the wars of Jarasandha and the Western tribes. I have already shown that Jarasandha represented the united tribes of the Kusikas and Magadhas, the black Southern and fair Northern races, and it was these people who, under the Kusika general Hansa, and the two other leaders Dimvika and Sisupala, king of Chedi, sacked Mathura and drove the Vrishnis and cattle-herding tribes to the sea-shore.1 It was these Vrishnis and cattle-herding tribes who were the Saka invaders. I have already in Part II. shown that the Iksh vaku race were composed of the Sakyas or Sakas, and the Sauvira.2 It was these Sakas who were the allies of the Aryans on the Sarasvati, and the war between Jarasandha's generals and the Western tribes was occasioned by the attempts made by the latter to extend their dominion east ward. This was naturally opposed by the Kusikas of Kasi (Benares) and the Eastern tribes, who at first successfully resisted the invaders, but were afterwards conquered by them. This conquest resulted in the submission of the Eastern empire of Magadha with its capital at Kasi, and the establishment of the Sakya rule with its capital at Saketa. Herodotus's informants, who told him of the Scythian inva sion and conquest of Asia Minor, said their rule only lasted twenty-eight years,3 but this must be quite unreliable. Other parts of the story, such as the acquisition of the Amazonian custom of self-mutilation, point to a long occu pation of the country, but the strongest evidence as to their rule is the wide diffusion throughout Asia Minor and Europe 1 Mahabharata, Sabha (Jarasandha-badha) Parva, xxii. p. 69; Sabha (Sisupala badha) Parva, xiv. p. 122; Part II.

If the worship of intoxicating drink as the supreme god was, as I hope I have proved, introduced into India through Scythian agency, and if the Soma sacrifice was an altered form of the analogous animal sacrifice among the Scythians, it necessarily follows that it was among them that the Dionysiac1 myth originated, and that it was by their influence that it was diffused throughout all countries of the ancient world. Evidence as to the Ethnology of the Mother-Worshippers. I have now brought forward evidence to show the funda mental religious beliefs, and the origin of the Kauravyas or linga worshippers, the Takshakas or sons of Kus, the Iravata or Haihaya, and the Vasuki. In Part II. of this series of papers, I had shown that of these races the Kauravya and Takshaka, whose original home was in the Northern Pan jab, spread themselves all over Northern India; that the Iravata ruled the whole country from Ayodhya on the east to the western ports; and the Vasuki were the latest immigrauts from the west, and that it was they who, as the Saka Sauvira, became the great conquering race of the Ikshvaku, who ultimately extended their rule over the whole of the Gangetic valley, and held in their hands the control of the whole commerce of Northern India, and of its chief foreign outlets, the western ports of Surpiiraka, Baragyza, Patala, and the eastern port of Tamralipti. But I have not yet completed the account of the oldest people of all, called in the list of snake races the Dhartarashtra, and in the Rigveda the sons of Bharata. In Part II. of this series I proved the intimate connection between these people and the Kolarian tribes, as shown in the name Bharata. I suggested that this name was from the Bar tree or Ficus Indica, in which case the Bharata 1 The Dionysiac myth, like Soma-worship, originated in phallic worship. The Dionysos of the Eleusinian mysteries was a phallic god, and Herod, ii. 48 tells us that in the ceremonies of the Dionysiac festivals, the phallus was a conspicuous object. The Bacchic orgies of the women also point to the old customs of tribal concubinage, which existed before marriage. Like that of the Soma festival, the history of the Dionysiac myth is an epitome of that of the evolution of religious thought.</page><page sequence="106">424 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. would mean the sons of the Bar tree. I also suggested that it might be derived originally from the Kolarian word " buru " a hill. The original home of these people I proved to be in Eastern India, where tribes still called Bauri abound.1 But in this survey of the ruling population I took no account of the people whose name is preserved in that of Magadha, where they established an empire which is shown, by the combined evidence of tradition and of the whole subsequent history of the country, to have been for many ages the dominant power in Northern India. The original capital of this powerful state was Kasi (Benares), which takes its name from the Kusikas or sons of Kasyapa or Kas. But this was a capital city before the Kusikas or Takshakas ruled there, and it was then the seat of the government of the Bharata, after whom India was called Bharatavarsha, or the country of the Bharata. But this powerful people, though named in the Rigveda,2 and regarded as a most influential section of the community, occupy a distinctly inferior position to the Danavas or Asuras, who are described as the principal opponents of the truth. The Danavas or Asuras were the serpent and linga worshippers. In the Mahabharata the two antagonists of the conquering Aryans and their allies are the two races called Daitya and Danava. The Daitya are the sons of Ditu, the second month in the lunar year, and that the Daitya were conquered by the Danava is shown in the legend of Agastya given in the Mahabharata. The story is as follows: Agastya the sage, who is the star Canopus, the principal star of the constellation Argo the Ship,3 wished to marry Lopamudra, daughter of the king 1 Part II. J.R.A.S. April, 1889, pp. 279-284. 2 There is a special Mandala, the 3rd, devoted to the Bharata, supposed to be written by Visvamitra, a Vedic bard, but who is really, like Prajapati, the mythical representative of the successive ruling deities of the triad. According to the later legends of the sun-worshippers, he was the father of Ashtaka the eighth Vasu. As the son of Gadhi he was a chief of the Kusikas, that is to say, he was the moon-god. 3 Alberuni's India, Sachau's translation, vol. ii. p. 66, quotation from Markan deya, a Hindu astronomer. Agastya is also (Rg. i. 170. 3) the brother of the Maruts who are also called in v. 3 of the same hymn the sisters of Indra.

He accordingly went to Trasadasyu, the son of Kutsa the Vedic hero, and ancestor of the cultivating tribes, Vradhnasva, who must be the same as Vadhriasva the father of Divodasa, the great Aryan champion of the Vedic Trtsus,2 and to Srutarvan, the king of the united Kuru-Takshakas, called Samvarana in the Mahabharata,3 and asked them to give him the money he wanted. They told him they had none to spare, but went with him to Ilvala (the son of Ila or Ida the mother earth) the Daitya, who they said had enormous wealth. At Ilvala's court Agastya devoured Vatapi, Ilvala's brother, who used to destroy Brahmins, and from fear Ilvala gave Agastya and his companions all the money they wanted, and a golden car drawn by two horses, Virava (the Viru or phallic god) and Surava (the sun-god). Afterwards Lopamudra bore him a son called Dridasyu, or the three Dasyus, who were the ruling races of India, answering to the Pandyas, Keralas, and Cholas of the Tamils.4 This legend, while on the one hand it may repre sent the acquisition of the various successive races who ruled the country of wealth from the mother earth, also clearly means the conquest of the matriarchal race of the Vidarbas by the successive tribes of linga-worshippers, among whom it would naturally be expected in a legend told by Aryan 1 Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxi. 89-91; J.R.A.S.

In determining the ethnology of these Daitya it must not be forgotten that the mother river of the Mazdean worshippers was the Daitya, the river of Airyana Vaejo where there are ten winter months, Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Farg. i. 3 and 4, vol. iv. Sacred Books of the East, p. 5. It must also be recollected that in the ritual of the seasonal sacrifices it was shown that the winter was looked on as the season when the work of producing the new year went on, and thus these ten winter months must be months of gestation.

They were all led by the pilot star of the con stellation of the Ship, showing that the pioneers of the conquest came to India by sea, and it also shows that the original legend told the story of a race earlier than the fire worshippers, whose guiding star was Tistrya the dog-star. This shows that in its first form the legend told of the con quest of the Daityas or mother-worshipping tribes by the first immigrants of the snake and linga-worshipping races. But though these conquering tribes were a seafaring people, the evidence seems to show that the mother-worship ping tribes also belonged to a maritime race. The chief cities founded by the Amazonian race on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, Askalon,1 Ephesus, Smyrna, and Myrina in Lemnos, were all great seaports, and in all these towns the great mother was the chief goddess.2 Cyprus also, the special home of the Cyprian Aphrodite, owed its pros perity to its maritime trade. But evidence which connects ships and mother-worshippers most closely together is the great reverence* with which the sacred ark or chest was regarded. The Din or Chista, the receptacle of the law, was no less sacred to the Zoroastrians 3 than to the Jews. But this sacred ark, which clearly represents the mother's womb, was originally among the Sumerians of the Euphrates valley, as Dr. Sayce shows, the ship of the gods in which they were carried in processions.4 It was only a trading people, accus tomed to travel in ships, who could ever have looked on the ship as the emblem of the great mother; and as the position and history of the Amazonian cities of the West seems to show that they were founded by a maritime people, it is exceedingly probable that they were nearly related to the Sumerian people of the Euphrates valley, who made the ship 1 Herod, i. 105. 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 235. 3 Chista or Chisti is the Angel of Knowledge (Farg. xiv. 39, Sacred Books of the East, vol. iv. p. 216, note 4), the most upright (goddess), clothed in white, the cursing, i.e. the strongest thought of the law of Mazda, Mihir Yast, xxxi. 126, vol. xxiv. p. 153, also p. 12, note 13.

This is further proved by the similarity of the language of the people of Lemnos with that spoken by the Akkadians. The Etruscan inscriptions of Lemnos, which have recently been interpreted by Mr. R. Brown, are written, as he proves, in a language exceedingly similar to the Akkadian, and these people must have brought their religion like their language from an Akkadian country.1 But if these people made their way to the Mediterranean, it is exceedingly probable that they also reached India, the El Dorado of antiquity, and it is for the evidence of this that we must now look. I have already shown that the mother-worshippers in India are called in the Mahabharata Daitya or sons of Diti, the second month in the lunar year. Now the second month in the popular year is not Diti, but Magh, and the ancient name of the eastern empire ruled by the mother-worshippers is Magadha. This name is now confined to Behar, but the people have always been known as Maghas. This name is preserved in the name Macco Kalingae or Mugho Kalingae of Pliny, and this race of Kalingas is divided into three sections, the Magho Kalingae of Magadha, the people called by Pliny Medo Kalingae, the Medo of the Monghyr inscription,2 who lived in the delta of the Ganges, and the Southern Kalingae of Hiouen Thsang, who ruled the Eastern Madras coast as far as Pulicat.3 But the name Magadha, the country of the Maghas, as well as the fact of the existence of a large population of Mughs on the sea-coasts of Eastern Bengal, especially in Chittagong, which they formerly ruled,4 shows that the whole population of the lower Gangetic valley were originally called Mughs. But these people were, as I have already shown, called Burs or Bauris, and as these people once formed the largest section of the inhabitants of Magadha 1 Etruscan Inscriptions of Lemnos, by R.

That this was the case is further proved by the fact that the Mughias, a large pre datory tribe in Rajputana, are also called Baorias. They are called by the latter name in Mar war, to the north of the Aravallis, and by the former near Nimbhera and Nimach, to the south. They are a brave and warlike tribe, who used in earlier times to gain their living as mercenary soldiers, but are now mostly thieves.1 These people must, from the similarity of the names, be identical with the ancient popu lation of Magadha. I have also shown that there is good reason to believe that there is a close affinity between them and the Daityas, who are, like them, called after the second month of the year. If so, the matriarchal tribes called Yidarba who were conquered by the linga-worshippers, whose guiding star was Canopus, wTere originally Burs or Maghas.2 Now these Vidarbas were a seafaring people, for it was the king of the Vidarbas who founded the port of Surat, the ancient Surparaka, on the Tapti,3 and the name of the Burs is preserved in that of the great port Baragyza on the Nerbudda, as well as in that of the adjoining kingdom of Baroda. They are also the Bhrigus, who, writh the Yatis or Haihayas, are named in the Rigveda as living in the country of the Vrishni race, to whom the bards of the Kanva family were the official priests, and, as the Bharata, were the allies of the Kurus in the great battle of the ten kings against the Aryan Trtsus and the Yrishnis.4 But if these people were generally throughout India called Bharata or Bhars, how did they get the name of Maghas, 1 Hunter's Gazetteer, vol. xi. p. 415, s.v. Rajputana. The Mughias say they got the name Baoria from Bauri, 'a well,' and have a legend to explain it; but the identity of the two names with those of the principal tribes of Eastern India shows conclusively that these names are both ancestral names. 2 The name Vidarba may mean the two united snake races, from ' vi' two, and 'arba,' the root of Arbuda, a snake. Their country is shown by the notices in the Mahabharata to have been the home both of the matriarchal races and the Haihayas, and it was in the Nerbudda valley that the war described in the Maha bharata between the Bhrigus and Haihayas took place, Adi (Chaitra-ratha) Parva, clxix. pp. 512-514; Part II.

If they were a seafaring people, they must have come by sea, and the fact that their original settlements were in the west proves that they must have come from that quarter. If so, they must have come from the Euphrates valley, whence all early maritime expe ditions started. I have shown that their rivals and con querors, the Haihayas, got their name from the god Hea, the Sumerian snake-god. Like the name Haihaya, the name Magha has no derivation in Sanskrit, and the very fact that it is, like that of the Haihayas, only used as the name of a conquering race, renders it probable that this was a name they brought with them from their native country. When they were once become indigenous to India, they called themselves Barata or the sons of the Bar tree, just as the Haihayas changed their name from that of the sons of Hea to the Matsya or Fishermen on the Virata. Now there is another country besides India which was much frequented by the early navigators of the Euphrates valley, for the same reasons as those which first induced them to visit India. This is the Sinaitic peninsula called Magana in Akkadian inscriptions, and it was from thence, as from India, that gold and jewels were procured in ancient times. In the tablets of Narain Sin, the son of Sargon, who lived 3750 b.c, the conquest of Magana is recorded, and it was thence that the much earlier inhabitants of the ancient Telloh brought the diorite used in the statues now found on its site. These must have been brought by sea.1 Now as these people called the Sinaitic country, which they always regarded as the holy land of Sinai, the mountain sacred to Sin the moon, Magana,2 it is exceedingly probable that they would also call their western treasure land by the same name. But such names as these were in early times gener 1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 31-33. 2 The sanctity attached to the land of Magana is shown in the Bible. It was there, at Mount Horeb, that Moses first formed the great conception of the con secrated Jehovah, and it was from Sinai, the sacred mount of Magana, that the law was propounded. The religion there preached was a return to the unity of the godhead, which was a fundamental tenet of the ancient mother-worshippers, who first worshipped the uncreated and creating earth, and afterwards the moon goddess, the ruler of heaven and earth, from whom the earth received her power.</page><page sequence="112">430 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. ally the names of a tribe; and if so, the name Maga * must have been in early times that of the Akkadian races. Now the modern name of the ancient city of Ur, the great city of the Sumerian race, is Mughir. This means the city (ir) of the Mughs. The Semitic Ir is evidently the same word as the Akkadian Ur, which meant both 'dog' and 'city ' (with which, by the way, should be compared the Tamil ur, city). This name, Mugh-Ir, therefore points to an ancient Mugh-ur, and it is thus that the modern name includes, as is often the case, the ancient name of the race who founded it.2 This makes it probable that the ships of Magan, mentioned in Akkadian inscriptions, may be the ships of the Sumerian Magas. But there is also a name of Indra which seems to confirm these conclusions. This is Mughavan, a name by which he is constantly called in the Rigveda, and which appears in the Mahabharata as Maghavat.3 This is usually translated ' mighty/ but its natural meaning is born of or accompanied by Magha. Therefore, just as Haihaya means the son of the fish-god Hea, Maghavan or Maghavat would mean the son of Magha; and as the early tribes named themselves after their chief god, who was their ancestor, the ancient Maghas would be sons of Magha. Indra is said, Rg. iv. 18. 10, to be born from the sacred cow, and in Rg. vii. 20. 5, to be born from the mother of men, that is, Ida, or the great mother, while in Rg. x. 101. 12, his mother is said to be Nishtigri, who is said by the commentators to be the mother earth. Magha is also a name of the wife of Siva, who is the mother earth, and the planet Venus is, as I have shown, called Maghabhu. The epithet Maghavat would thus mean the god born of the mother earth called by the name of 1 The name of the Magi also seems to show that this was an early name of the Sumerian race, for the religion of Zarathustra is, as I have shown, derived from that of the Asura,the ancient Sumerians, and as their holy men were always called Magi, the name probably was one which was derived from a Sumerian tribal name. They were the original magicians or sorcerers, and sorcery and witchcraft was a distinguishing mark of the earliest religions, a sign of the fear of the un known and inexplicable. 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 42.

But there are other names of the planet Venus, which also show a special relation between it and Indra, and also between the planet and the Bharatas, who are the Maghas, and the Danavas, who are the snake-worshippers, for she is called Sukra, which is one of the names of Indra, Bhrigu, Bhriguputra, and Bhargava, all meaning that she is the god or goddess of the Bharatas and Danava-guru, that is, the " guru" or teacher of the Danavas; in this last epithet showing that the Maghas or sons of the great mother preceded the Danavas or snake-worshippers.1 The original god Indra, as I have shown, came from the Euphrates valley, where he was Hea the fish-god, and the goddess of the Bhurs or Maghas, who was so closely related to him, must have come from the same place. She .must have been the ancient Sumerian earth-goddess, who afterwards became Davki or Davkina, and who, we are told by Dr. Sayce, was worshipped at the port of Eridu as the Gingiri or creator,2 and it was she who was the mother of Hea and his counter part Indra. It is in the country of Magadha and throughout Eastern India that the worship of the great mother, the mother earth, is most prevalent at the present day, and it was in the Kalinga country that the custom of human sacrifice, called the Meriah, lasted longest, and it was these sacrifices which were originally offered by the Maghas to their mother goddess Magha, and it was she who became the second month of the year, the wife of Pushya or Piishan, the sacred bull, or the companion of the great mother Tai, who origin ally ruled the first month. In this capacity she was the moon-goddess, and hence her daughter Venus is also called Sita, which means the moon.3 But the worship of the great mother was also associated with matriarchal customs and the system of tribal rule. This, which was the most ancient Dravidian plan of govern ment, gave much greater power to the women than they ever 1 Alberuni's India, Sachau's edition, chap. xix. vol. i. p. 215. 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 2*i5. 3 Alberuni's India, Sachau's edition, chap. xix. vol. i. p. 215.</page><page sequence="114">432 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. had under the later patriarchal rule. That similar customs existed in ancient Magadha we have undoubted proof, in the account of the court arrangements of Chandragupta, king of Magadha, which were recorded by Megasthenes, who lived for some time at his court, as ambassador from Antiochus. These statements are preserved by Strabo.1 He describes the women as being more trusted than the men. They were the king's personal body-guards. They surrounded him when he went out to hunt, and joined in the sport, some from chariots, some from horses, and some from elephants. They also served as soldiers, clad in full armour. In considering the significance of this account, we must remember that the great Chandragupta was not an Aryan king. He and the kings who preceded him for many generations belonged to the Naga or snake race. The dynasty was founded by Sisu naga, from whom Bimbisaro, the contemporary of the Buddha, was fifth in descent. We know accurately the date of Bimbisaro's reign, which began b.c. 537, therefore Sisu naga must have reigned about two hundred years before. This Naga dynasty, which he founded or rather restored, supplanted the rule of the Ikshvakus or Western Sakas, who had previously governed Ayodhya and the surrounding countries from the capital of Saketa. When these Western invaders were overthrown, and the old Naga race came again into power, it would be natural that they should restore their old customs, even if they had been subverted by the Sakyas, and among these was evidently the custom of employing women on precisely the same footing as men.2 I have thus shown that the early mother-worshippers were probably originally called Maghas, that they came from the Euphrates valley, and that they established matriarchal rule throughout India, distinct traces of which remained in the customs of the courts of the kings till a late period. It was they who were the first rulers of the country among the five 1 Strabo, xv. 1. 53-56; McCrindle's Ancient India as described by Mega sthenes, pp. 71-73. 2 I must not be understood to assert that Chandragupta was a descendant of Bimbisaro. He belonged to a totally different family, but still one of Naga race, as his name Chandragupta (protected by the moon) proves.</page><page sequence="115">HISTORICAL PROOFS FROM SACRED ANIMALS. 433 races known as the Snake races. They must have spread themselves throughout the length and breadth of the land, for as the Bharatas they were the ruling race in the North, and as the Vidarbas or the matriarchal races they were the first founders of stable government in the South. It was they who were the first worshippers of the moon-goddess, who, as the heavenly mother, ruled the months first and afterwards the mother's year of ten lunar months. It was the earth that was the mother of the seasons which, with the recurring months, formed the original measures of time. Historical Evidence given by Sacrificial Animals. But before the moon-goddess was thought to be the measurer of time, and the god that gave productive power to the earth, that office wTas ascribed to the blood of human beings, and the mother earth, fertilized by human blood, was the earliest idea of creation. It was thus that man was held to be the first of sacrificial animals, and the successive series of sacrificial victims given in the Brahmanas completely coincides with the evolution of religious thought, and this again represents the succession of dominant races, as each race was distinguished by a special victim. The following is the list of animals successively considered fit for sacrifice, as given in the Brahmanas.1 1. Man. 2. The horse. 3. The ox. 4. The sheep. 5. The goat. But this order is not historical, and the object of change from the true order of history was, like that of other changes in the ritual made by the Indra worshippers and Sakas, to do honour to their national gods. Thus the horse is placed next to man, as the first animal that became too noble to be sacrificed, because the horse was sacred to the Sakas; and the goat came last, because it was the victim offered by the lower classes, who represented the early linga-worshippers. History, on the other hand, tells us that it was the early mother-worshippers of Bharata, and Maghas of Indian history, who offered human sacrifices. 1 Sat. Brah. i. 2. 3. 6, vol. xii. p. 50 ; Ait. Brah. ii. 8, Haug's translation, vol. ii. p. 90.</page><page sequence="116">434 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. That the shepherds or early linga-worshippers, the Kauravyas, sacrificed the goat to the moon-goddess, who ruled the woman's year of ten months, and the year of eleven months sacred to the god of the linga. The ox was sacrificed by the sons of Kus or Kasyapa, the Takshakas, the founders of the full lunar year of thirteen months, who regarded the moon god as the cow and bull of light. Next came the horse, which was the sacred animal of the Indra-worshippers and Sakas; and last of all the sheep, which was offered by the early Aryans to Varuna, and afterwards to the sun-god, and it always remained a solar victim. Thus rams were offered to Apollo,1 and Balak king of Moab offered to the Moabitish sun-god, at Balaam's request, a bullock and a ram on each of the seven altars he successively built.2 This selection of five sacred victims in the Brahmana is, like the other instances where the number five is used, based on the five seasons into which the sacrificial year was divided. But the five victims also have a genuine historical meaning, as they denote the animals especially sacred to the five races, who were recorded in the priestly annals3 as the successive rulers of India. The chief object of these annals was to maintain the efficacy of the sacrifices, and to prevent the countrv from suffering from the evil consequences which must follow maimed offerings made by ignorant priests. Therefore all changes made by each dynasty who succeeded to the supreme rule were carefully recorded, and these annals became a record of the history of the country. Though, as I have shown in the preceding pages of this essay, the changes made by each dynasty or race were very great, yet, as they preserved the worship of and reverence for the older gods of their predecessors, they can, as I have tried to prove, be easily detected by an analysis of the ritual; and from the whole a fairly accurate sketch of the history of the country can be made. In the evidence that I have brought forward 1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. Sacrifices, vol. xxi. p. 135. 2 Numbers xxiii. passim. 3 The Sybilline Books of ancient Rome are a specimen of these annals, which were doubtless preserved, first by careful oral tradition, and afterwards in writing, by the national priesthoods of all people who could boast of a history.</page><page sequence="117">THE PANDAVAS REPRESENT FIVE SEASONS. 435 to prove that the sacrificial history deduced from the Brah manas agrees with that taken from the legends, there are disturbing elements arising from the apparent antagonism of the conclusions based on a series of five races or five fathers, and those drawn from a series of three fathers and mothers. In the analysis of the three seasonal festivals I have shown that this last arrangement of ancient history was made by the Saka and Aryan invaders, who, as immigrants from the far North, brought with them their ancestral custom of dividing the year into three seasons; and as all successions in time were based upon the year and its seasons, the number of ancestors must always be equal to that of the seasons. This tripartite division was not altogether strange to the Turanian races, as they all worshipped a triad of godsl before they mixed with the Aryans; but even if it had been, reverence for the old ritual made it impossible that it should be superseded by the new ; and therefore, when the two races amalgamated, both were retained, and an eclectic ritual made by uniting them, the union being made with the slightest possible change in the older ceremonies consonant with the preservation of adequate respect for both the new and the old gods. But it is in the Mahabharata that we see the influx of the new ideas most clearly. We find there first of all the five snake races. (1) The Dhritarashtra or Bharatas. (2) The Kauravyas. (3) The Takshakas. (4) The Iravata. (5) The Vasuki. But these races are almost destroyed in the opening sections of the poem, only a remnant being saved by Astika, the eighth Vasu or the sun-god, who protected them from being burnt up by Janamejaya. The real action of the poem begins with the birth of the Pandavas, who were in one sense the old five races re-born and purified as grandsons of the holy Rishi Vyasa, and re puted sons of Pandu, the father of the fair people, and in another sense, as Ludwig has already suggested, the iiye 1 The fivefold division of the seasons was, as I have shown in the analysis of the gods invoked, based upon a triad.</page><page sequence="118">436 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. seasons.1 But these five fathers of the improved race are descended from the three mothers, Satyvati, the possessor of truth ; Pritha=Prithivi, the mother-earth, sanctified by her descent from Sura the sun-prince; and Madri, the daughter of Salya, king of the Takshakas, representing the northern non-Aryan immigrants. They are thus, both on the father's and mother's side, descended from a northern stock, who divided the year into three seasons. But these five Pandavas are not only hallowed by their descent from the Rishi Vyasa, but also by their divine parentage. Thus (1) Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, whose wives are the ten daughters of Daksha, who are the ten months of the mother's year,2 represents the purified Bharata and the spring. (2) Arjuna, the son of Indra, the Vasuki and the summer. (3) Bhima, the son of Vayu the wind, the powerful wielder of the mace, the Kauravya, the linga-worshipping races of the earth3 or rainy season, the time of storm and tempests, and Sahadeva and Nakula, the sons of the heavenly twins by Madri, the Takshaka princess, are the Iravata who, like Sahadeva, con quered the South, and the Takshakas who ruled the North and West, which was conquered by Nakula.4 As seasons, they were the autumn and winter, and this confirms the con clusion I had arrived at from other reasons, that the full lunar year which the representatives of the Takshakas thus closed, was first calculated by the northern immigrants, the sons of Kasyapa or Kus, who were the ancestors of the Takshakas, and it also shows that the worship of the twin brethren originated, as I have already maintained, with the Kusikas. That the whole poem represents the conflict between the 1 Ludwig, Ueber das Yerhaltniss der mythischen Elementes in der historische Grundlage des Mahabharata, p. 14.

Folge, Band 12 (1884). 2 It was from the ten lunar months of gestation that the first conception was formed of the immutable laws of nature. This conception was embodied in Dharma the law, and all Dravidian aspirations were directed towards the discovery of the laws which, when obeyed, were to make human society a representation of the union of heaven and earth. 3 Bhima conquered the East, Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxix. and xxx. pp. 84 87. * Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxi. and xxxii. pp. 87-94.</page><page sequence="119">MEANING OF THE STORY OF THE MAHABHARATA. 437 reformers and the old religions and races is proved by its argument. It begins with the conquests of the four brethren Arjuna, Bhima, Sahadeva, and Nakula, ending with the rule of Yudhishthira, the Golden age, when justice ruled the earth. The rule of justice is subverted by the consequences of the Gambling match, that is, by wars and fighting, which ushered in the rule of the Kauravyas. The thirteen years1 of the exile of the Pandavas represent the rule of the races whose year was the full lunar year of thirteen months. When the Pandavas emerged from their eclipse, and began to contend writh their foes, the forces of the Kauravyas were divided into eleven Akshauhinis or divisions of troops, representing the eleven sacred months of the original sacrificial year of the snake-worshippers, and those of the Pandavas into seven, representing the number sacred to the Semite-Akkadians, the people who first sanctified, the seven days of the week.2 The whole result of the conflict is that Arjuna, the son of Indra, who represents the Ikshvaku confederacy, headed by the Sakyas and their god Sakko or Indra, is the sole survivor, and the triumph of the Ikshvakus is secured by the overthrow or death of their competitors. The whole story is told in a poem of eighteen cantos, representing the year of the re formers, divided into six seasons or ritu of two months each, and twelve solar months, or it may represent the original year of five seasons and the lunar year of thirteen months. 1 Sabha (Anudgata) Parva, lxxvi. p. 201. 2 Udyoga Parva, lvi. The Panchalas were led by Dhrishtadyamna, the son of Drupada, king of the Panchalas, born from the sacrificial flame of the sacrifice anointed with butter offered by Yaja, the impure Brahmin, Adi (Chaitraratha) Parva, clxix. pp 480-483. He was in other words the sacred fire of the Srinjaya or Panchalas invoked in Rg. iv, lo. 4, as "the brightest and most fiend-destroying of fires." It is this fire which was, as I have shown, that which kindled the annual animal sacrifices. The whole story, like that of the slaying of Bhishma, the eighth Vasu of the Kauravyas, by Sikhandin, the bisexual representative of Amba the great mother, shows that the conquest of the Pandavas over the Northern tribes, who in India worshipped the sun Bhishma, and the sun, moon, and heavenly powers alone, was secured by the aid of the mother-worshippers, and the worshippers of the united Siva and Durga, the Vinlj, together with that of the Matsya, and Virata, the Indra and linga-worshippers, and the Semite Akkadians or Saka-Sauvira or Vrishnis, and Andhakas. in other words, it was the amalgamated people who had formed themselves into an indigenous nationality, represented by Arjuna's banner adorned with the sacred ape (Kama Parva, lxxix. p. 303, and many other places), who conquered those who remained isolated and conservative and attached to their peculiar creeds and customs. YOL. XXII.?[new series.] 29</page><page sequence="120">438 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. The thirteen years exile of the Pandavas, and the general argument of the poem which seems to celebrate the triumph of the old religions in a purer form, points to the latter conclusion. But the lists of sacrificial animals in the Brahmanas do not include all that were offered, and it is especially deficient in the animals offered to the mother earth. The reason of this is obvious. The most ancient sacrifice to the earth was man, and the continuance of this sacrifice was secured by the doctrine that the sacrifice was man, and that the animals offered were offered as his ransom. This being once accepted, no further offering was necessary. But other animals, which were still offered in other countries for ages after they bad been discontinued in India and among all the Semitic nations, had once occupied a distinguished place in the Hindu ritual. In an old list of sacrificial animals given in the Anguttara Nikaya,1 the pig and the cock are named as sacrificial animals. The cock is still sacrificed by the abori ginal tribes to the mother earth, and in Greece it used to be sacrificed to ^Esculapius, who was probably derived through the Egyptian Imhotep from Hea the Sumerian god of wisdom. He appears in Indian mythology as Ganesa, who, as the elephant-god, is the especial god of the Iravata, but one adopted as the deity of the race after the name Iravata, which, as I have shown, meant the sons of Ida or Ira (the sacred cow or bull), came to mean an elephant. Thus the cock sacrificed to ^Esculapius was originally sacrificed to the mother earth, and the Ida, who was the purified mother earth of the race who in India made the elephant-god called Iravata or Ganesa as their protecting deity, was successively the mother earth, the sheep,2 the cow, and the bull. Thus 1 Anguttara Nikaya Chatukka Nipata Chakkavagga, 39. 2, Morris's edition, published by the Pali Text Society, part ii. p. 42. 2 Caldwell, Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, p. 464, quotes from Dr. Gundert Ida as a Sanskrit word, equivalent to and derived from Tamil Eda or Edaka, a sheep or goat, which also appears in another form in the Dravidian Adu. It thus appears probable that Ida became the mother earth of the shepherds or earliest linga-worshippers, the first Kauravya, before she became the cow, and afterwards the bull of the Kusikas. It was in her third transformation that she became the purified earth of the worshippers of Indra or Hea, the god of the fertilizing waters.</page><page sequence="121">SANCTITY OF THE PIG. 439 the history of the sacrifice of the cock, and of the deities to which it was offered, discloses a long series of chapters in mythological history. As for the pig, he occupied a very honourable place among the sacrificial animals of Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. He was looked on as the purifying animal, and was offered for purposes of lustration by the Phrygians, Lycians, and Greeks.1 At the annual festival of the Arvalia at Rome, held to secure the fertility of the Latin fields, the grove in which it was held was cleansed from tbe impurity caused by the iron with which the trees were felled, by the sacrifice of two young pigs.2 In India, when the sacrifice was origin ally offered, the pig was probably sacrificed on account of its fertility, and it was thus adopted as an animal especially sacred to the mother of all beings.3 Among the Akkadians it appears in one of the titles of Adar or Uras, who is called the lord of the pig,4 showing that he was originally looked on as the father, and therefore the lord of the fertile mother. It was also in Greece not only a lustral animal, but one offered especially to the mother earth. Swine were sacrificed to Aphrodite in Cyprus, also to the same deity in Argos and Thessaly, and they were especially sacred to Aphrodite in Athens,5 and they were also sacrificed to Demeter and Ceres, the original Greek and Roman representatives of the mother earth.6 In India the sacrifice probably disappeared entirely 1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth edition, art. Phrygia, vol. xvii. p. 853. 2 Ibid. art. Arval Brothers, vol. ii. pp. 671, 672. This shows that the sacrifice points to a time long before the Iron age. 3 The pig is still, as every one who has served in Behar, the ancient Magadha, knows, the sacred animal of the Dosadhs, who represent the earliest ruling race in the country, as is proved by the fact that the village watchmen were always Dosadhs. There can be no surer test of the former antiquity of any race in India than that shown by their fulfilling the office of village watchmen. 4 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 153, note 6. 5 Robertson-Smith, Religion of Semites, Lecture viii. p. 272. 6 Encyclopaedia Britannica, art. Ceres, vol. v. p. 345. Pigs were, as Hero dotus tells us, sacrificed in Egypt to the moon, and Dionysus, the phallic god, at one full moon in the year, and that then the flesh was eaten, though at other times it was abhorred. The sacrifice was evidently to the two mothers, the earth and the moon, and the earthly father called here Dionysus. The former reverence paid to swine as sacred to the mother of all beings is also shown in the same passage, where Herodotus tells us that all betrothals were arranged in Egypt by swineherds, while the further custom, that daughters were not married from their parents' but from some other person's house, points to the ancient time when, by</page><page sequence="122">440 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. from the ritual with the advent of the earlier worshippers of Hea or Indra, as the god of the fertilizing waters, as from that time water was used as the means of procuring cere monial purity, and the pig had probably before that been displaced from its high position as an animal sacred to the mother earth, by the goat, the victim sacred to the earlier linga-worshippers, and sacrificed by them to the phallic god and the moon-god. Another animal which was sacrificed in other countries, but not as far as I can discover in India, was the dog. The history of this sacrifice seems to throw most valuable light on ancient chronology and the course of religious evolution. The dog was certainly a sacred animal to the northern Akkadians, as it is represented in their mythology by the four hounds of Bel-Merodach.1 But it is as the animal sacred to the fire-god Adar that it appears as a sacrificial victim in Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. Adar or Uras was at Nipur " the god of glowing fire," and was a most popular deity at Nineveh among the Northern Assyrians, but was not a favourite with the Southern or Semitic Babylonians.2 This god became in Asia Minor the Tyrian Hercules called Melgarth, and there he was especially associated with dogs. Dogs were also sacred to the Athenian Hercules, as is shown by the name Cynosarges or dog's yard, where his shrine was situated. According to iElian, sacred dogs accompanied the Sicilian god Adranus, who has been identified with Adar.3 But it is in the worship of Ares in Greece, and Mars in Rome, that we find the dog actually sacrificed. Dogs were sacrificed to Ares in Sparta, and the Latins offered a red dog to Mars at the Arvalia, to prevent the crops taking fire. The symbol of Ares was Sirius the dog-star, and there thus appears every reason to connect him with the Akkadian tribal custom, all the women of the tribe were dedicated to the tribal gods, and the woman selected to bear children used to go to the temples, where the begetting of children was a sacred ceremony. Herodotus tells us that this custom was still kept up in his time to a certain extent by the visits made by women to temples in almost all countries except Greece and Egypt, Herod, ii. 47. 48. and 64. 1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 288, 289. 2 Ibid. pp. 152-154. 3 Robertson-Smith, Religion of the Semites, Lecture viii. p. 273, note.</page><page sequence="123">THE FIRE-GOD DOG OF THE GODS. 441 Uras, the god of glowing fire.1 The development of this god into Hercules with the club shows that the god of fire was originally the god of the fire-stick, who in the ancient triad took the place of the phallic father. The fire-god in India appears also as a snake-god, and as the planet Mars, under the names Pushkara, Bharma and Takshaka, and in conjunction with the moon Pushkara he rules the four months of the summer season.2 The close connection of the old fire-god and the moon-god is again repeated in the Brah manas, where Agni and Soma are always treated among the earliest gods. The connection between the fire-god and the Takshaka, as shown in the list of the dominant gods of the seasons, where Takshaka in one list takes the place given to Pushkara-Bharma in the second, is a further proof that it was the race of handicraftsmen, called Takshaka in Hindu mythology, and the sons of Tubal Cain in the Bible, who introduced fire worship. A further proof of the epoch during which fire became sacred is given in the Rigveda, where, in a hymn to the Ribhus, the respective deeds of the water-god, the earlier Indra, the fire-god, and the god of the lightning or thunderbolt, who was the later Indra, the warrior god, are discussed. In this hymn Agni, the dog, is said to have been appointed by the goat as the waker of the new year,3 so that the dog succeeded the goat as a sacred animal, and the Tak shakas, who reverenced the dog, must have succeeded the earlier Kauravya, who worshipped the goat, as rulers of India. Throughout the Rigveda and Brahmanas the dog and Agni are both regarded as the messenger of the gods. As Sararneya, the Greek Hermes,4 he is both messenger and watch-dog, and both chronologically and mythologically he and Sarama, the dawn, stand, as Max Muller says, " on the threshold that separates the gods of light from the gods of 1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth edition, art.

It is Agni who, as the messenger to the gods, takes the sacrifice up to heaven, and it is thus he is called the Brahman, for he held in the older sacrificial ritual the same office as is assigned to Brahma, the god of prayer, in the services to the gods of light. From these notices it is clear that the worship of the fire-god came to India when the religion of his votaries had reached the metaphysical stage, when materialistic sacrifices were beginning to be discredited, and offerings burnt by the sacred fire were substituted for the bloody sacrifices of the earlier materialistic age. The old gods had, according to the teaching of the Brahmanas, gone up to heaven, and were no longer to be fed by the blood of the sacrifice poured out on the earth, but by the smoke and sweet savour ascending to heaven.1 It was then that the gods became thinkers, and that the new creation, the work of Manu the thinker, began. This was continued under the next regime of the Iravata, or early Indra worshippers of the sacred water as the origin of life, till the earth was quite cleansed from the evil influences of the old materialistic religion, and a new earth, peopled by worship pers of the heavenly gods, succeeded that which had been the home of the sons and worshippers of the evil serpent, who was in India the great snake Nahusha, in Iran the three mouthed Azi Dahaka, and in Greece the serpent Pytho, the god of the Delphic Oracle. The most salient example of the change wrought by this great revolution in the ancient mythologies is that given by the worship of Aphrodite, who became, from the Pandemic goddess of the Cyprian shrines at Salamis, the goddess of beauty, who rose up out of the purifying waters of the sea. The sea-god, Poseidon himself, is also an ancient deity, who assumed a new form from the water-worshippers. He was 1 Sat. Brah. i. 3. 3. 13. 14, vol. xii. p. 88, also note 2, where Agni is said to be the Hotri or sacrificial priest who carries the offering to the gods. He is succeeded in this office by the Vashat call, or the call meaning may he carry it up. This was pronounced by the Hotri at the end of the offering-prayers, which were muttered to the older gods, and loudly chanted to the accepted Vedic deities. This change, from the burnt offering to praise and prayer as the true sacrifice, as is shown later on, was made by the Aryan Brahmans. The Jewish ritualists regarded the sacred fire in the same light as the Hindus. See Levit. ii. 2. 9, iii. 5.</page><page sequence="125">POSEIDON AND PUSHAN. 443 originally a lunar and phallic god, as black bulls were offered to him. Bull fights took place in his honour in Ionia and Thessaly, and at Ephesus he was called the Bull Poseidon, while his cup-bearers were called bulls.1 He next became the fire-god, and in this capacity assumed.the trident, or symbol of the fire-stick, as his sacred weapon. In these changes, as well as in his final transformation to be the god of the sea, he resembled the Sumerian god Hea; and even if the actual derivation of the Hindu Pushan and the Greek Poseidon (the god having the form eibcoXov, representing etBcov of Poos or Push), from the same Akkadian root, is untenable, there is undoubtedly a great similarity between them. To both black bulls were sacred, both were gods of battle, and Pushan, like Poseidon, was the form of the phallic god which was espe cially sacred to the adorers of the god of the water of life.2 In this summary of some of the coincidences between the mythologies of Europe and Western Asia and those of India, I hope I shall be thought to have proved that in all these countries national as opposed to tribal religion began with the worship of the mother earth, and that this was succeeded by that of the phallic gods. The next change was the deposition of the phallic god, and the elevation of the moon-god to the principal place in the triad. This was accompanied by the worship of the fire-stick. Then came first the worship of the god of the water of life, and next that of the god of the divine drink, the Dionysus and Bacchus of the Greeks and Romans, and the Soma of the Hindus. All these changes appear to have been wrought by five successive races, whose ethnology I have attempted to trace; but in doing this difficulties arise from the regular sequence of events in all these countries being dis turbed by complications introduced by the Sakas and Aryans. 1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth edition, vol. xix. p. 58, art. Poseidon. The connection between Poseidon and the worshippers of the god of the divine water is further shown by Prof. Tiele's identification of the Latin Neptunus, Poseidon's counterpart with the Apam Napat, the god of the waters, of the Zendavesta. This name, he says, has disappeared among the Greeks. But if my suggestion is right, it has not disappeared, because it was never adopted by them. They worshipped the same god under his other name of Push.

Historical Evidence given by some of the Myths of the Hermes Series. But it is in the myths of the Hermes series that we find perhaps the most valuable evidence connecting the gods of Greece both with the Aryan gods of India and with their Non-Aryan predecessors worshipped by the Hindus in India and by the Turanians on the Euphrates. First Hermes, Hermeias, is, on the authority of Kuhn, Benfey and Max Muller, now admitted to be the same as Sarameya, the dog of the gods in the Rigveda. Secondly. Hermes is the god of the fire-stick. He is the phallic god of the Cabiri, the counterpart of Hephaistos.1 Thirdly. He is, like the Indian Agni, the messenger of the gods. He is the leader of the two dogs who guard the under-world, the other being the Greek Kerberos, the Sanskrit Sarvara, the spotted dog.2 Fourthly. He is, the dog who is said in Rg. i. 161. 13, to be appointed by the goat to succeed him, and to waken the year to revived life. To find Hermes under this guise in Greece we must look to the story of Io. Zeus changed Io into a white cow, that is to say, he made her the moon goddess. This shows that she was first a dark divinity. Zeus sent Hermes to get her from Hera, the original moon goddess, to whom the goat was sacred. This is just the same as the Vedic story, except that in the Greek myth Zeus gave Hermes charge of the white year cow, the moon and not the goat, who, in the Veda, took the place of Uz, the Akkadian goat god, who directed the course of the year, and in solar times watched the revolutions of the solar disk.3 Fifthly. Both the Hindu and Greek mythologies make the fire-god, who succeeds to and helps the moon-goddess, the active productive agent.4 But there is still much more to be learnt from the story 1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, xi. p. 749, s.v. Hermes. 2 lb. p. 750. 3 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p- 285. 4 The Sacred Hermai of Athens, described by Herod, ii. 51, as phallic images, show that Hermes was originally a phallic fire-god.</page><page sequence="127">THE TWO WATCHERS CALLED ARGUS. 445 of Io. Her father was Inachus, the river of Argos, the father of the Argive race, but this seems to be later than the time of the myth making her the daughter of Iasos, the change being made when the worshippers of Poseidon, the god of the waters, sanctified the rivers, and made them fathers of those who dwelt on their banks. Her name appears as the violet "lov and the ^loviov-irekayos, the violet dark Adriatic across which she swam.1 Thus before she was the moon-cow she was the goddess of the dark vault of heaven, the Rama of the Hindus,2 the T'hom of Genesis, the Abza of the Akkadians, of which Ea, the fish-god, was lord.3 The hundred-eyed Argus, who was set by Hera to watch her, was first lulled to sleep by Hermes, and afterwards killed by him with the Harpe, or crescent-shaped sword, or the new moon with which Merodach killed Tiarnut the dragon.4 Here Argus the guardian bears a name very like that of Argos, Io's birth-place. Hermes, as the slayer of Argus, is called throughout the Iliad and Odyssey Apyet^ovr^y a name also given to Apollo as the slayer of Apyas, the Doric for snakes.5 Mythic story also tells of another Argus, the dog, whose death is so touchingly described in the Odyssey as happening in his twentieth year, when he saw Odysseus, the wandering sun-god, come back to his home in the West.6 It was through the help of Hermes that Odysseus came back, and the watch-dog he had left behind must probably belong to the group of guardian dogs connected with Hermes. In his life of twenty years he completed by reduplication the era sacred to the mother sanctified by her ten lunar months of gestation,7 just as the twenty-four books of the poem mean 1 Liddell and Scott, 'IoVtos. 2 Rama means darkness. 3 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 102. 4 Encyclopaedia Britannica, xiii. s.v.

But ApyetcfrovTrjs, when applied to Apollo, means the slayer of snakes, called Apyas. Almost all evil beasts killed by mythic heroes are either snakes or their offspring dragons, for these are merely snakes invested by myth makers with non-serpentine attri butes ; it is therefore most likely that Argus slain by Hermes was, like the dragon killed by Perseus, and Tiamut by Merodach, with the same weapon, a snake-god, like the Vritra or snake-gods killed by Indra. Before inquiring whether all these similar words can be derived from the same root, or whether the verbal coinci dences they show cover a radical difference of origin, we must turn to the myth of Iason, connected with that of Io by the name of her father Iasos, and the epithet "laaov Apyos, the Argos of Iasos.1 It was he who, with the Argonauts, made the celebrated mythical voyage in the ship Argo. This ship Argo, which adds another name to the list of those seemingly connected with Argos, is shown by Aratos to mean the constellation of that name, as in his Phaino mena, v. 348, he speaks of it as Iason's Argo. This poem is the versified form of the Phainomena of Eudoxus, an astronomer of Cilicia, who lived between 403-350 B.C.2 The constellation Argo is the largest of the brilliant groups of stars encircling the Southern Cross, the most conspicuous group near the Southern Pole.3 Its principal star is Canopus, the Hindu Agastya, which, as I have shown in pp. 424-426 of this essay, led the snake-worshipping Danavas to India. This star is not visible in Europe, nor " in any locality higher in latitude than the southern part of the Mediter ranean," but it was to the Southern nations the leading star 1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, xiii. p. 202, s.v.

Mr. Brown shows that Eudoxos must have derived his facts from the Chaldaean astronomers. 3 Guillemin, The Heavens, edited by Norman Lockyer and Proctor, pp. 287, 288.</page><page sequence="129">THE STABS EULERS OF HEAVEN. 447 of the firmament, and is spoken of by an Egyptian poet of the time of Thothmes III. about 1600 B.C. as " Karbana " (the Karbanit of the Assyrian astronomers of A ssurbanipal) " who pours his light in a glance of fire when he disperses the morning dew."1 It was only a southern race who could have made Argo and its stars their heavenly guide, or the great snake their chief god. But the Dorians of Argos came from the South. Their father was Danaus, and he in mythic legend is said to have come from Egypt, where Canopus, sacred to the chief star of Argo, was the leading port before the rise of Alexandria.2 But these people brought to Crete and Greece Dravidian customs, as shown in the common meals {gvggLtio), the Spartan training of both sexes, the five Ephors,3 and above all, the great snake god Pytho, who inspired the oracle at Delphi before he was killed by Apollo. These customs, as well as their reverence for the constellation Argo, must, as I shall show, have been brought from a country far to the south of Canopus at the mouth of the Nile. To explain this we must look to the Zendavesta and Mahabharata. In the Zendavesta we find that the rulers of heaven are four stars, which have in them " the seed of the waters, the seed of the earth, the seed of the plants," Tistrya, Satavaesa, Vanant, and the Haptoiringus.4 It is they who maintain law and order, and who war against and destroy the Pairikas, the planets or wandering stars, who by their motions throw the heavenly system into confusion.5 The staunchest defenders of order are Tistrya, which is the dog star Sirius, who protects the moon, and Satavesa, who pushes the waters forward.6 They rule the East and the South, while Vanant rules the West, and the Haptoiringas (the Great Bear) the North. It is Tistrya who, like Sarameya, 1 Eridanus, River and Constellation, by R.

This phrase is explained in the Bundahis, where the constellation Sataves is said to control the tides in the sea of Sataves, the sea of Oman,1 and to bring back into the Arabian Sea, called Vourukasha, the water purified by its inflow into the Persian Gulf, called Puitika, or the " clean sea."2 Here, as in the Greek myth, we have the dog-star or fire-god who protects the moon, placed in apposi tion with another star or constellation called in the Zenda vesta Satavaesa.3 But to see what star or stars are called Satavaesa, we must turn to the Hindu legends of Agastya. In one of the myths of the Mahabharata of which he is the hero it is said that the gods when oppressed by Nahusha (the great snake) betook themselves to Agastya, and induced him to drink up the waters of the ocean which covered the evil seed of the race of Nahusha (the Kalakeyas), and that to repair the evil done by him, the moon-goddess, in the shape of Ganga, the great river, fills the sea and brings the waters back again.4 Here we have the phenomena of the tides ascribed in mythic language to Agastya, the chief star in Argo, just as Satavaesa, which apparently means 1 West, Bundahis, ii. 7 and xiii. 12, Sacred Books of the East, vol. v. pp 12 and 44. 2 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Fargard iv. 17-19, Sacred Books of the East, vol. iv. pp. 53-54. 3 Vaesa or Satavaesa seems to be connected with Vaesaka, the head of the Visah family, who was defeated by Tusa, the son of Naotara (the new star), Aban Yast, 53-59, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiii. pp. 66-68. Tus again may be the same as the Polar star called in the Babylonian Tablet Turas, and Danu the divine judge, line 13, star x.; Remarks on the Tablet of the Thirty Stars, by R. Brown, jun., Part II. Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology for February, 1890. Satavaesa again would mean the hundred (sata) Vaesas or Vasas, the stars of the constellation Argo, as opposed to the new star Tistrya, and the moon, who, like the Polar star, represented the Northern races as warring against the people and star gods of the South. 4 Mahabharata, Vana (Tirtha Yatra) Parva, ciii.-cix. pp. 324-340. That Ganga, the great river, was originally the full moon, is proved by Rg. ii. 32. 7, where Ganga, SinivatT, and Raka are called on to help women in labour. Sayana says Ganga is the full moon, and the same as Anumati. This latter word is said in the Ait. Brah. 7. 11, Haug's translation, vol. ii. pp 457, 458, to mean the full moon, Sinivati the new moon, and Raka the last half of the new moon day. The feminine form Ganga is used to represent the moon as the goddess, but Gangu must, in Rg. x. 48. 8, mean the river and not the moon, as Indra is there said to have led the Atithigiva (a name for the Aryan Trtsu) to the Gangu, see Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, chap. xiii. p. 352.</page><page sequence="131">AGASTYA THE STAR CANOPUS. 449 the whole constellation Argo, controls the tides in the Zenda vesta. In the Hindu legend Agastya, the ruling star of Argo, is succeeded in this work by the moon-goddess Ganga, who supplies water to the sea, just as Tistrya, the rain-star, who protects the moon, gives her the waters which enable her to fulfil her mission. Both the stories point to a time when the control of the tides was held to belong to the constella tion Argo, the ship of the heavenly mother, but when the coincidence between the high tides and the new and full moon was observed, this office was transferred to the moon, who was also held to be the measurer of time. But this could only have been done in the Oceanic seas facing the Persian Gulf. Neither in the Red Sea nor in the Mediter ranean could the tides have attracted much notice, and it must have been the people who, as they sailed out of the Persian Gulf, saw Canopus lighting up the Southern heavens, who attributed to its power the ebb and flow of the tides. They found the tides to be hardly perceptible in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, the only other seas with which they were acquainted, and thus it would seem that the power of Argo, which was low in the heavens and partly invisible, was less than when the constellation was in the Arabian Sea high above the horizon, near the Southern pole. It was in the North that they reached the home of the god of the fire-stick, and the decrease of the power of Argo in this region was ascribed to him who was said to have lulled Argo to sleep, and to have stopped him from troubling the waters, while Argo or Argus was finally dethroned and slain when the moon was installed as the measurer of time and the controller of the tides. But the Hindu Agastya was not always a star. In a passage in the Va^asaneya Samhita, used in the ceremony of shaving the heads of all male children, we find that the threefold age of the three fathers of the race, Jamadagni, Kasyapa, and Agast}^, is called on to give long life to the boy, whose hair is moistened by the sanctifying water.1 Of 1 Sankh.

Kasyapa is the father of the Kasi, the husband of Daksha's thirteen daughters, who are the thirteen lunar months, the originator of the lunar year, and Agastya must therefore be the god who is older than these two Northern gods, the great snake or phallic god of the South, called Nahusha when on earth. He was cast down from heaven by Indra, who was the new star (Naotara) of the Zendavesta, Tistrya, the blazing dog-star, just as Argus the watcher was lulled to sleep by Hermes the fire-god. When the moon-goddess became the ruler of heaven, her union with the god called by the men of a later age Zeus or Dyaus, the god of the bright sky, was completed, and this union was commemorated by the great festival of the "lepos yapo?, the sacred marriage, held annually at Argos in February-March, the month "Hpcuos, called at Athens TapbrjXmv. But the actual event symbolized by this marriage seems to have been the addition of two months to the former sacred period of eleven months, making the full lunar year of thirteen months ; but this dropped out of memory when the solar year took the place of the lunar year.1 Before the invention of alphabets and the diffusion of written literature, popular myths were found to be the most impressive and lasting teachers of history. If my conclu sions are right, the myths I have analyzed give in outline a complete account of the Northern progress of the seafaring races of the Euphrates valley, who made their way by the Red Sea and Egypt to the coasts and islands of the Eastern Mediterranean. The same myths also throw light on the connection between the Euphratean races and the people who lived and traded on the Western coasts of India. They tell us of a race of trading seamen, whose chief gods were the mother earth, and the snake their father, whom they had 1 See Encyclopedia Britannica, s.v. Hera, xi. p. 680, also Io, vol. xiii. p. 202. The husband of the moon-goddess was probably originally "laaos, the son of Io, the dark night.

The dark abyss of night was the heavenly mother, and the stars which guided them on their voyages were her sons. The father king and leader of this heavenly host was the brightest star of the constellation near the Southern Pole, which was to them the ship, that is the ark or womb of the mother of the stars. The might of the king was shown in his control of the tides, and he led his worshippers over the pathless wastes of the sea. Guided by him, and the coasts, they came by the Red Sea into Egypt, and thence to the Mediterranean, where they met the race of handicraftsmen whose gods were the pair of fire-sticks, from which the fire which worked the metals of their craft was born. These people kept dogs to guard their property, and looked on the " sentinel stars" as the heavenly watch-dogs. But these sons of Kus also went by land to the Euphratean countries, and on their way southward, through the desert tracts of Central and Western Asia, they learnt that the god of the fertilizing rains was an agent no less active and necessary for the production and maintenance of life, than the divine heat of the fire. When they came to the shores of the Southern ocean, and had risen to influence in the country, they were able to point out that, great as was the power of Canopus in controlling the ocean tides, it did not extend to inland waters like the Caspian Sea, and the Southern sailors had already learnt how feeble the tide-force was in the Red and Mediterranean Seas. The Northeners argued that the real rulers of the stars must be the star in the East, which brings the rain,1 and this star they took to be Tistrya, a name seemingly connected with the Akkadian Tsir,2 a snake, and it was he, the brightest star in the heavens, whom the Akka dians looked on as the heavenly snake ruling in the East, the home of the snake-worshippers. This star, which, unlike Canopus, was visible in the North, became to the Northern 1 The rainy countries of India lay in the East. 2 See Mr. Brown's interpretation of line 29, star xxv. in the Babylonian Star Tablets, part ii.

He, as Hermes, lulled the leader of Argo to sleep, by counteracting in the North the power by which he ruled the Southern waters. He, as the heavenly guide of the fire-worshippers, protected the moon, when the race of handicraftsmen found out that she was the measurer not only of monthly but also of annual time, and made her the ruler of the heavens. Her power was universal, and not like that of the rain-bringing Tistrya and the tide-controlling Canopus, restricted to especial quarters of the heavens, while in the Southern Ocean, the peculiar domain of Canopus, her power at the new and full moons was greater than his. It was through the agency of the dog-star, as Hermes, that the moon-goddess was made ruler and consort of the dark vault of heaven. The two united rulers were probably at first feminine, being symbolized as Io and Hera, Io then became Iasos, her son, and he was afterwards changed to Zeus and Dyaus, the ruler of the bright sky, by the sun-worshippers. I cannot now follow the mj^ths further through all their ramifications, but every one of the conclusions seems to follow naturally from the varying forms of the story which I have traced back to the Euphrates valley. They are all supported by proofs, and the truth of the whole series of historical events taught, if my conclusions are correct, by these myths, is corroborated by the evidence from other sources, which proves that early civilization in Asia and Europe was founded by a race of Southern Dravidians living near the shores of the Persian Gulf. These people made their way northward by sea, and both in the North and in their original home, they were aided in their task of improving human institu tions by Northern immigrants of a different race. But if this is the case, the names of the mythical beings, and of the places recorded in these stories, ought to be derived from Dravidian roots, whereas they almost all come from an Aryan root " ark," meaning to be bright. There fore either (1) these names are not the original names given by Dravidians to the beings and places to whom they are assigned, or (2) " ark," if adopted as an Aryan root, must be</page><page sequence="135">ROOT ARK PERHAPS FROM AKKADIAN UR. 453 traceable to Dravidian sources. That the first supposition will not meet the facts of the case, seems to be clear from the persistence of the names. The Aryan-speaking Greeks would hardly have given a new name to the ship Argo while retaining the old legend, but at the same time the root " ark," to be bright, is widely disseminated through Aryan languages. It is impossible in the present state of our knowledge of the mutual interchanges which must have accompanied the union of the Aryan and Dravidian races to trace words from one to another authoritatively, and to enable us to do this we must await the rise of another Grimm, who will do for Dravidian and Aryan tongues the work Grimm did for Aryan languages. That the words I now allude to ought to be Dravidian, seems to be proved by very strong historical evidence, but as to the linguistic proof I can only offer the following conjecture. In the first place I would point out that one at least of these names derived from " ark," that of Argos the city, has an alternative form Argolis, meaning the country of Argos. In Akkadian lan guages " gal" is one of the nominal suffixes, added to roots to make substantives,1 and Ur-gal would therefore be a regularly formed Akkadian noun. This might possibly be connected with the Akkadian Uru-gal, the great watcher, which would be a most appropriate name for the leader of the heavenly ship.2 There also appears in one of the Magical Texts, translated by Dr. Sayce, a word Ud-gal, which he translates as " great worms," and he also in a note says that "udda" probably means a kind of serpent.3 There is also in Tamil a root " uru,"4 to creep, and in Canarese another similar root "ur-i," to burn, which is apparently reproduced in the Lat " uro," to burn, the Armenian "or," the Hebrew " ur," and the Afghan " or " or " wur," meaning fire, all of which seem to show a connection between the creeping snake 1 Haupt, Akkadische keilschrift texte, p. 137. For this reference I am indebted to Mr. Evatts of the British Museum. 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 80, where the term is used for the high priest of Bel. 3 lb. p. 451, note 2. 4 Caldwell, Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, p. 467. tol. xxii.?[new series.] 30</page><page sequence="136">454 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. and the blazing fire. When we further remember that the Southern Dravidians made the snake the great father on earth, and translated him to the sky as a star and the father of the stars, who were also heavenly snake-gods, it becomes exceedingly probable that all these names originally came from a root " ur," perhaps meaning a snake, and that " ark " comes from these roots by adding to it g, the radical conson ant of the nominal suffix. " Ur" in Akkadian means the foundation, the city, the girdle or horizon, and also the dog, and all these various meanings would naturally be assigned to it by the intermixed Southern Dravidians and Northern Aryans, whose history is described in these myths. Evidence as to the Changes wrought by Aryan Influence. The ancient ritualists, like the Comtists of the present day, traced religious evolution to three distinct stages of thought. In the first, or theological stage, the gods were the mothers and fathers of their worshippers. In the second, or meta physical stage, thought intervened and interpreted and spiritualized the godhead. While the third, or positive stage, was represented as the product of speech. In India it was the sons of Saravati (the possessor of speech), the Sakas and Aryans, who were the leaders in this second or rather third revolution. It was they who brought from heaven, not only the immortal Soma, the drink which made men equal with the gods, but also the divine gift of song. It was the divine bird, Suparni or Gadura who brought these immortal and life-giving gifts to earth. In Greece it was Dionysus himself who was born from Demeter the mother earth, and it was Orpheus,1 the god of the lyre, who recalled the dead Eurydice from the grave; while it was his successor Apollo, also the god of music 1 The myth of Orpheus, who, after he rescued his wife, Avas slain by the Bacchantes, who were jealous of his unconquerable love for his wife, also illus trates the change wrought by the Aryans in the introduction of family life. The Bacchantes represent the Thracian women, who mourned the close of the old period of tribal life, when permanent marriage was unknown. The close con nection between Orpheus and the Dionysiac orgies is exactly similar to that between the Soma worship and the sanctity of song in India. They were both the work of the same race. See Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth edition, Orpheus, vol. xviii p. 51.</page><page sequence="137">CEREBRAL LETTERS IN SANSKRIT. 455 and of song, who killed the great snake Pytho. The feeling of hesitating dread with which the startling changes made by Aryan innovators were regarded by the practical Dravidian theologians is well shown in the account of the dispute between Mind and Speech given in the Brahmanas.1 They both contended before Prajapati, the chief of the older gods, which was the best. Prajapati decided in favour of Mind, as he said Mind did the work which Speech followed and imitated, and in consequence of his denying all power of invention to Speech, she refused to officiate at his sacrifices, which were accordingly performed in a low voice, without loudly chanted hymns to bear the offerings of the worshippers to the gods. Henceforth they worked together, Mind con veying to the gods the sacrifices offered without hymns, while Speech conveyed those accompanied by sacred hymns. But this great change could only have been accomplished after an enormous lapse of time, for before it could ever have been begun, the Hindu people must have learned to speak Sanskrit dialects. All those now spoken show unmistakeable traces of having been formed from the Sanskrit spoken by a Dravidian race, and even the Vedic Sanskrit could only have been used as a language by a people who originally spoke Dravidian tongues. Almost all scholars now admit that the Sanskrit Unguals t, d, dh and n are of Dravidian origin.2 Therefore the authors of the Rigveda, who habitually use these letters, must have been the descendants of many gene rations of Sanskrit-speaking people, whose primitive speech had been altered to meet the linguistic requirements of the Dravidian race who formed the great majority of the ruling races of the country. These people must not only have learnt Sanskrit from their Sanskrit-speaking mothers or fathers, but also from Sanskrit schoolmasters. It must have been the sons of Sarasvatl who first added literary teaching to the physical, political, and industrial training which was so carefully looked after in all Dravidian states. The changes 1 Sat. Brah. i. 4. 8-12, vol. xii. pp. 130, 131. 2 Penka, Origines Ariacae, chap. v. p. 144, Caldwell, Comparative Grammar of Dravidian Languages; Excursus on the Origin of the Cerebral Sounds, pp. 32-47.</page><page sequence="138">456 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. in the language which produced the Vedic dialect must have begun ages before the earliest hymns of the Rigveda were composed ; but even when the dialect was formed, a long interval must have passed before the earliest hymns could have been put into verse. Before this was done the metres had to be arranged, and as all these are shown in the Brah manas to have a ritualistic meaning, these metres must have been accepted as especially sacred by a professional priest hood, who had before laid down rules as to the sanctity of numbers. Evidence as to the Antiquity and Historical Significance of the Sacred Sanskrit Metres. The metres declared to be sacred in the Brahmanas are : (1) The Viraj metre, consisting of three lines of ten syllables each. (2) The Trishtubh, of four lines of eleven syllables. (3) The Gayatri, of three and four lines of eight syllables. (4) The JagatI, of four lines of twelve syllables. I have elsewhere shown the connection between the Viraj metre, the worship of the mother earth, and phallic worship; but this metre, though it is mentioned in the Brahmanas, was, as representing a form of faith which was by its antiquity buried in mysticism, regarded, like the offerings to the great mother, as lying outside consecrated ground. The mother earth belonged to the old triad, but was not considered to be one of the three succeeding triads which Vishnu conquered. These were the triad of the gods of the earth or the phallic gods, which were conquered by the Gayatri, the gods of the air, or those of the Indra-worshippers by the Trishtubh, and the gods of the sky or the heavenly triad by the JagatI. It is these metres which are said in the Brahmanas to represent the three strides of Vishnu.1 The Trishtubh metre of four times eleven syllables is evidently framed in honour of the eleven gods or months of the ancient sacrificial year, to whom the eleven victims were offered at the animal sacrifices. 1 Sat. Brah. i. 9. 3. 10, vol. xii. p. 269.</page><page sequence="139">SANSKRIT AND ZEND METRES. 457 The Gayatri metre is that which is especially sacred to Agni. The eight syllables represent the four Agnis re duplicated to make a productive pair, while the three-lined stanzas are sacred to the three older Agnis, the four-lined to the four Agnis.1 The Jagati metre of four times twelve syllables is that sacred to Vishnu, the Semite Akkadian god of the solar lunar year, and the four lines represent the four Agnis. The age of the formation of these metres is limited by that of the last of them. They must all have been elaborated after the Semite Akkadian Vishnu-worshippers came into India, and that there was a very early connection between these immigrants and the Aryans of Iran is shown in the legend in the Bhavishya Purana, which tells how Samba, the son of Krishna or Vishnu, brought the priests of the Magi into India from Sakadwipa.2 The truth of this legend is further corroborated by an examination of the Gathie metres in the Zendavesta. Of the five Gathas two, the Gatha Ustavaiti and the Spenta Mainyu, are in the Trishtubh metre, but the stanzas in the Ustavaiti are not, like the Sanskrit Trishtubh stanzas, made up of four lines each, but of five.3 The metre of the Ahunavairya, the first and oldest Gatha, consists of stanzas of three lines of sixteen syllables each, which resembles the Gayatri metre.4 While the metre of the fifth Gatha, the Vohukshathrem, which is written in lines of fourteen syllables each, with a caesura between them, is unlike any of the sacred Sanskrit metres.5 The metre of 1 See Rg. i. 152, 2, where the strong " four-cornered weapon,'' the four Agnis forming the sacred oblong figure of the altar, is said to have conquered the "three-cornered," the triangle of the worshippers of the triad, which was placed as the protector of the central fire on the altar in the three "paridhis," or enclosing sticks representing the three former Agnis in the seasonal sacrifices. See ante p. 338. In the present quotation the "four-cornered" weapon is said to have destroyed the haters of the gods, that is, the worshippers of the old triad. 2 Part II. J.R.A.S.

Its stanzas are four lines, the first two of eleven or twelve syllables, the third and fourth of fourteen syllables, with a half line of five added to each.1 While these metres partly agree with those of the Sanskrit hymn-writers, they show more completely than the latter do the amalgamation between the Turanian races, to whom five was the sacred number, and the Northern people, who were the Yasukis of India, who believed in seven Vasus, to whom the seven days of the week were hallowed. This is, as shown in the Appendix, a funda mental principle of the Zoroastrian sacred Chronometry. It must have been the priests who were accustomed to the use of hymns composed in these metres in Iran who brought them to India; and that this actually was the case is proved by Dr. Haug, who has shown that the Udgatris or Chanters were, with the Brahma, Brahmana Chamsi, and Subrah manya, later additions to the number of sacrificial priests. In the Asvamedha hymn of the Rigveda (i. 162), which is accompanied by a Soma sacrifice, the sacrificial priests are named, and there are, according to Dr. Haug, no Udgatris or any of the other three classes of priests named above among them, nor were priests of this class known to the Zoroastrian ritual.2 But the reciters of praise (sansta suvi prah) mentioned in v. 5 with the other priests must have been their forerunners; and that these again were preceded by ritualistic sacrifices without hymns is shown by all the sacrifices to Prajapati and the older gods being performed in a low voice. The evidence seems to show that it was the Iranian priests accompanying the Sakas and Aryans who first brought the sacred metrical systems into India ; but these were after their arrival reduced to that which governs the collections of the Rigveda. But the whole arrangement shows that it was under the influence of Dravidian ideas of law and order that the several metres were adapted to the worship of the several classes of gods who had been admitted 1 The Zendavesta, part iii. translated by L. H. Mills, Sacred Books of the East, vol, xxxi. p. 187. 2 Aitareya Brahmana, Haug's edition, vol. i. Introduction, pp. 18 and 19.</page><page sequence="141">HISTORICAL SUCCESSION OF SACRIFICES. 459 to the honours of the sacrificial ritual by successive invading and ruling races. But it was to the Aryans that the spiritual idea underlying this new arrangement was due, and it was they who substituted the sacrifice of praise, thanksgiving, and prayer for that of food given as fruits of the earth, or of the sacred animals. These bloodless sacrifices again were a substitute made by the later Indra-worshippers for the animal sacrifices, which were taken to the gods by the sacred fire. These burnt offerings had, as I have shown, superseded those in which the blood of the victims was poured upon the earth. We thus have historical evidence for five distinct series of sacrificial forms, each denoting an advance made by conquering and innovating tribes. 1. The human sacrifice to the mother earth, which was that of the mother-worship ping races, the Bharata. 2. The sacrifice of animals as a ransom for the sacrificer, in which the blood fertilized both the linga and the earth. This was the sacrifice of the shep herds or Virata or Kauravya. 3. The burnt offering made with the sacred fire, the sacrifice of the Kusikas or Takshakas. 4. The sacrifice of the fruits of the earth, and of the animal products of butter, curds, whey, and milk, the sacrifice of the Iravata or early Indra-worshippers. 5. The sacrifice of praise, thanksgiving, and prayer, which was that which the Vasuki were led to adopt by the teaching of Aryan and Semitic immigrants. The whole process, among a people so conservative and tenacious of old customs as the Dravidians were, must have been very slow, and must have occupied thousands of years before the Semite Akkadians brought in the solar-lunar year about 4700 b.c. After they had consolidated their power, and after the Aryan-speaking invaders had made their language the official language of the country, and had elaborated a dialect suited to Dravidian organs of speech, the metres they had brought from Iran, as well as those sub sequently framed, had to be arranged in logical order; and when the hymns began to be written, the work of selecting those which were to be considered sacred had to be begun. This work was not carried on from one common centre, but</page><page sequence="142">460 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. by a number of different associations of bardic priests, who were distributed over the different districts of Northern India. When each priestly family had prepared its own special collection of sacred hymns, these had to be again sifted and arranged by the compilers of the Rigveda as it has come down to us. They, especially in the first, ninth, and tenth Mandalas, had to unite together large numbers of poems not reckoned among those accepted by the more im portant schools. The time occupied in these arrangements must, even in an age when writing was known, have been enormous; and if writing was unknown, it must have been still greater.1 If the Rigveda in its present form was com pleted and issued as the official collection of sacrificial hymns about 1400 b.c, it seems to me to be probable that the Brahmins who fixed the date of the Veda, that is, of the com mencement of the formation of the collection of the hymns of the Rigveda, at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, or 3102 B.C., were more likely to have erred in making the date too modern than too ancient. In considering this question, it must be remembered that, as Dr. Haug points out, there were in the Nivids, and other non-Vedic liturgical formulae, hymns apparently older than any of the Vedas.2 During this period, besides the date of 1426 B.C., which I have already noted as shown by Mr. Bentley to be the year when Krittaka was made the first of the Nakshatras, the only certain date we have is that in which the five years' cycle was finally adjusted for sacrificial purposes. This 1 I would here ask whether it is not possible that the Semite Akkadians, who wrote their language both in Assyria and Babylonia, should have brought some form of writing with them to India, for surely the early inhabitants of Telloh, who took their ships to the Sinaitic peninsula for the transport of the stone used in their inscribed statues, must in their voyages to India have brought the art of writing to that country. The Semite Akkadians, whose Phoenician alphabet is the original of the Sanskrit alphabet, knew the Cuneiform character in Babylonia, and those who came to India must have used it, and their predecessors must also have used the earlier and more hieroglyphic form we find at Telloh. If the Hittites, Egyptians, and Akkadians possessed an alphabet, surely the Hindus, who were no less civilized, must have done the same ; and I cannot but believe that careful research will disclose some remnants of old writing in India. Without the art of writing, the miracle of the composition and preservation of ancient Sanskrit litera ture is almost too great for belief. 2 Aitareya Brahmana, Haug's edition, Introduction, vol. i. p. 36.</page><page sequence="143">CHRONOLOGICAL RETROSPECT. 461 adjustment is recorded in the Jyotishan or Vedic Calendar. The cycle then began with the month of Magha in the Nakshatra Sravishtha, another name for Dhanishtha. The date of this arrangement was determined by Archdeacon Pratt as 1181 b.c, and by the Rev. R. Main at 1186 b.c.1 But these dates must mark nearly if not quite the close of the Vedic and ritualistic periods. Probable Length of Time occupied by the Changes occurring before the Beginning of the Vedic Period. But if the formation and dissemination of the Hindu Aryan languages, and the consolidation of Aryan ritual, must have occupied such long periods of time, what must be said as to the length of time required for the birth and growth of the civilization on which even the crudest form of the doctrines of mother-worship is based, the extension of these doctrines and those of early phallic and moon-worship throughout Egypt, "Western Asia, Europe, and India, the introduction and diffusion of fire-worship and water-worship, and of the Dionysiac cult ? Taking India alone, the Dravidian land organization, which must date from the time when the rule of the mother-worshippers was established, presupposes a Kolarian division of the country into villages and provinces, for these divisions are found in parts of the country where there are not now any traces of Dravidian or Aryan rule, and where both Dravidians and Aryans have always been hated. A full study of the question will leave no doubt that the dominant system of land tenure all over India is Dra vidian, and that it is certainly based on a previous Kolarian occupation, while in Aryan districts it has been again altered to suit Aryan customs.2 I have shown in Part II. the power 1 Max Midler's Preface to vol. iv. of Rigveda, p. 85. 2 I have fully discussed the whole question in an essay read before the Socie'ty of Arts, and published in their Journal for May, 1887. 1 may also say that it was entirely from a thorough study of the land question as Settlement Officer in Chota Nagpore, and in Chuttisgurh in the Central Provinces, two districts which had been almost totally free from Aryan influences till we conquered India, that I first came to believe in the active part played by the Dravidian races in the develop ment of India.</page><page sequence="144">462 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. exercised by the Kolarian Malli, Turvasu, and Yavana, in times much later than those when the mother-worshippers were supreme rulers, and this power must be based on an ancestral occupation of the country previous to the arrival of any immigrants from the West. Therefore the first mother worshippers who came from the Euphrates valley must have found that they had to deal, not with a land of virgin forest and unoccupied plains, but with a large continent which was covered over with communities belonging to another race, though these were probably widely scattered and scantily peopled. There was plenty of room for both, and amalgama tion was easy, as both the new comers and old settlers were not separated by racial intolerance, and there was practical good sense on one side, and the friendly welcome to peaceable strangers always given by Kolarian tribes, on the other. But, in spite of these advantages, it must have been very long before the new comers spread themselves over the continent, became the dominant rulers, and established the prestige which made the divine mother they worshipped the symbol, throughout all succeeding religious and racial revolutions, of the greatest and best of the gods. These people were again followed by the linga-worshippers or Virata, known through out India as the Naga or snake race, the sons of the great serpent Nahusha. These new comers displaced the mother worshippers in the Western half of India, and exercised wide-spread influence in all parts of the country where good culture and irrigation were valuable. They were again subdued by the Kusikas or Takshakas, and they successively by the Iravata and Vasukis. The great power of the Iravata is conclusively shown by the wide diffusion of their name as that of the ancestral river of different countries, which were perhaps ruled at the same time by kings of this race. This is reproduced in that of the river Iravatl, Ravi, or Purushni in the Punjab, in that of the Iravatl or Rapti in Ayodhya, and in the Irawaddy, another form of the name Iravatl, in Burma, and proves that the Iravata or Haihayas ruled in all these countries, that is, over the whole of Northern India and Burma, and</page><page sequence="145">ANTIQUITY OF EARLY DOGMAS. 463 this extensive dominion could only be acquired after a long struggle with the previous ruling races. The same may also be said of the Vasuki Sakas and their Aryan allies. But the long ages required for the wide diffusion and con solidation of the rule of the dynasties and races of earth, moon, and snake-worshippers and their successors, who all looked on the moon as their chief deity, must also have been preceded by a very long period during which the civilization, on which even the rudest of these religions was based, was being evolved. The earliest Dravidian emigrants, who left their homes in the Euphrates for the Western countries on the one side, and India on the other, took with them the belief that the mother earth was the author of all life, and they also appear to have at least believed that the moon was the measurer of time, and the moon-goddess the law-giver who appointed the recurring months and seasons. But whether this last belief was one formed before or after the emigration, there can be no doubt that in all countries the worshippers of the mother earth believed in the vitalizing power of the blood of the sacrifice. But this materialistic belief implies that those who held it had advanced to a stage of civilization much higher than that which is indicated by fetishism or totemism. These religions can both be held by a wandering tribe, but a religion based on the idea of the fertilization of the soil would never have been developed among a migratory agricultural population. It was to fertilize the soil that human sacrifices were offered. A wandering people would acquire the advantages thus sought for by changing their quarters; they would, like the forest tribes of India of the present day, look out for fresh lands every two or three years, when those they had cleared were exhausted. This constant change was not possible among a stationary people, who had so spread themselves over the country as to make it difficult to find fresh fallow land ; and though some fallows are always kept in all early systems of husbandry, yet wherever there are settled communities, there is everywhere some land close to the village which is always under crop, and which must therefore be perpetually</page><page sequence="146">464 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. manured. It was from the necessity of manuring land that was to be kept fertile, that the idea of the fertility caused by the blood of the sacrifice was derived, at least I see no possibility of explaining it otherwise ; but before it became an accepted tenet of religious belief, it must have been thoroughly impressed on the minds of the people by a long continued occupation of land in a somewhat thickly populated country, before the sacrifice to the mother earth was thought to be more important than those offered to local deities to avert misfortunes and accidents. It was only a very nume rous tribe, or confederation of tribes, long united by national ties, which could ever have thought of worshipping a common mother; for before this they must have got rid of the early feeling of suspicion which made every stranger an enemy. The national progress implied by this religious develop ment must necessarily have been very slow. As we see from what now goes on in nearly all newly settled countries where the people live in villages, the first villages are fixed at wide distances from one another; these, as they increase in size, form hamlets of emigrants from the parent village, who settle near it, and these again become the centres whence new villages are formed: but this process takes a very long time. It is only trade which rapidly increases population and stimulates energy, and in early times trade could only be carried on along the banks of great rivers and by easy coasting voyages. Therefore the arks or ships, which were the sacred shrines of all ancient people, must have been one of the earliest products of civilized energy ; and it was when the people living on the Euphrates and Tigris first found out how to make boats, and to navigate rivers, that their national prosperity began. Till this stage of progress had been reached, the advantages and possibility of emigration could not have been conceived, and emigration on a large scale was impossible till maritime trade had been long estab lished. Ages must have passed before the people of the Euphrates valley were able to send out emigrant fleets to India and Egypt. Yet all the evidence points, as I have</page><page sequence="147">EARLIEST EMIGRATIONS MADE BY SEA. 465 shown, to a very early occupation of the Sinaitic peninsula and of Egypt, and also to that of the Indian continent. In their progress through that country they must have had to depend for assistance on oxen, both as carriage and plough animals, and it must have been these people who tamed the wild cattle and buffaloes in India, which were never used by the Kolarian tribes.1 There is no reason whatever to say that the emigrations by sea, which I contend must have been made in the very earliest times, were impossible. What is impossible is that the concurrent evolution of civilization on precisely identical lines in countries so remote as India, Egypt, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy, could have taken place, unless the different races had taken their first plans from a common centre, and this centre must have been the Euphrates valley. Emigration by land on a large scale was much more im possible than emigration by sea, for how would it have been possible to provide for the commissariat of the emigration of bands of settlers large enough to resist opposition ? Such people must either have exterminated their opponents or been exterminated by them, for they would be sure to be opposed if they came in numbers sufficient to eat up the land. On the other hand, if the emigrating people could make ships, comparatively small numbers might make their way to a new country, and settle there in numbers sufficient for defence, but not so large as to excite hostility. These small settlements could be joined by other immigrants, to whom the first comers could convey news of their prosperity. They had only to do what the Norsemen Vikings did in times recorded in history, and if they could make ships and had the courage and energy necessary to enable them to make sea voyages, they could emigrate, and ships are, as I have shown, always named as among the earliest products 1 I have already, Part I. J.R.A.S. April, 1888, p. 332, shown that the Kolarians never use milk. The wild cattle must have been the Bos Gaurus, the Gaur or so-called Bison, which are really wild cattle. They were tamed by the early Dravidian settlers, just as the Bos primigenius or Urus was tamed in Europe. It was from the Gaur or primitive cattle that the mother earth probably took her name of Gauri, which meant the cow-goddess.</page><page sequence="148">466 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. of human skill, and they were made long before iron or metals were used. But however far back we may, by the help of imaginative speculation based on waifs and strays of Ancient History, trace back the beginnings of the vast series of events I have so imperfectly sketched, we must remember that geology proves almost conclusively very early emigrations to Europe of wandering tribes from Asia. These emigrations must have begun towards the close of the Glacial period, for the men of the early Stone age who lived during this time were, as Sir John Lubbock informs us, " Brachycephalic to a very marked degree,,, with " heavy overhanging brows."! These people were almost certainly of Turanian, and therefore of Asiatic origin. They were the people whom De Quatrefages calls the men of Furfooz, whose remains are found in Belgian and French caves with the bones of horses, oxen, reindeer, wild boar, chamois, aurochs and the Saiga antelope.2 These remains show not only that they were a pastoral and hunting people, but that the climate must have been sufficiently cold to allow of the reindeer, which can only flourish in a land of almost perpetual snow, to live there in large herds. These people must have been the ancestors of the present Basques, who speak a Turanian language, and of the other mixed Doli chocephalic and Brachycephalic people of Europe who are named in De Quatrefages' book as extending through the Sub-brachycephalic to the Sub-dolichocephalic races.3 But whether these people emigrated from Asia or not, there can be no doubt whatsoever that their successors of the later Stone age did so, and that they maintained a connection with that country. The proof of this is the fact that, not only in many Swiss Lake-dwellings, but in various parts of Italy, France, Germany and England, jade axes have been found, chiefly in Neolithic remains.4 These appear to have been looked on as especially sacred, as, to quote one instance, there were 1 Lubbock, Prehistoric Times, second edition, p. 164. 2 De Quatrefages, The Human Species, chap, xviii. sect. v. pp. 340-341. 3 lb. pp. 372, 373. 4 Lubbock, Prehistoric Times, second edition, p. 78.</page><page sequence="149">RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE OF JADE. 467 "eleven beautiful jade celts found in the great tumular mound of Mont St. Michel, at Carnai, in Britanny."1 This number has a curious coincidence with that of the eleven victims offered in the Hindu annual animal sacrifice to the older gods, and looks as if it implied a similar number of victims as offered at the burial of the chief whose grave is under the mound. But what makes the presence of jade most remarkable is, that it is not found in Europe, and is only now known to exist in large quantities in Turkistan or Western China in Asia.2 Among the Chinese a special value has always been attached to it, and it is called the Yu, or gemstone, meaning the first of jewels. Its name in Spanish is " piedra de hijada," or loin-stone, and this and its other name of nephrite, or kidney-stone, both point to some connection between jade and generation, such as that which I have shown was attached in all ancient rituals to sacred sacrificial objects.3 The sanctity of jade must be connected with its colour, and this would make it probable that it was the earliest moon-stone or stone sacred to the moon. This meaning is certainly implied in the name given to it in Turkistan, which is " yeshm," the eye, and if it originally meant the stone sacred to and partaking of the nature of the moon, the early reverence paid to it would be additional evidence proving that moon-worship became one of the earliest concomitants of earth-worship. At any rate, the presence of these jade axes points to a very early trade and intercourse between Western Europe and Eastern Asia, and seems to prove that the people who used and reverenced them were emigrants from Asia, and as they were the ruling races of Europe during the Neolithic age, it adds additional evidence to that already given to prove that the gradual extension of Dravidian civilization from the Euphrates valley may have proceeded along two lines, and 1 Lubbock, Prehistoric Times, second edition, p 155. 2 Encyclopaedia Britannica, ninth edition, art. Jade, vol. xiii. p. 510. 3 See, with reference to this subject, Prof. Robertson Smith, Religion of the Semites, Lectures, x. pp. 359, 360, where he shows that according to Semitic ideas the seat of. life lay in the viscera, especially in the kidneys and liver.

I have now finished the task I proposed to myself at the beginning of this essay, and have, I hope, conclusively proved the great historical importance of the evidence furnished by the Brahmanas, or ritualistic manuals of the Hindus. The conclusions I have thence deduced are, I am fully aware, new; but I hope that the evidence I have brought forward will be thought by scholars to be sufficient, if not to prove conclusively the truth of all my deductions, at least to warrant the fullest inquiry being made on the same lines by others who are trying to map out the course of ancient history. I am fully aware of deficiencies in this as in my former essays, as there are still in this obscure subject many points on which I have been unable to arrive at conclusions which are more final than that given by a balancing of hypotheses. But I am also perfectly certain that my main conclusions are true; and if further proof is required, I am able to bring it forward under many heads of the argument, should the present proofs be deemed insufficient. I have not now brought out all the evidence I have collected, or any thing like it; for if I had done so, my essay would have exceeded all reasonable limits of length. The final con clusions I would submit to the judgment of scholars, as those found in this and the former essays of this series, may be shortly summarized as follows: (1) That the sacrificial observances and evolution of religious thought among the Hindus, as ascertained from a study of the Brahmanas, Rigveda, Mahabharata, and other records of early antiquity, show such agreement with those which can be deduced from the mythological and traditional history of Western Asia, Greece, Italy, and Egypt, as to make it almost certain that they all derived their civilization from one common centre, which must have been the Euphrates valley. (2)</page><page sequence="151">INDIA OR SINDYA THE LAND OF THE MOON. 469 That Dravidian tribes allied to the Sumero-Akkadians of the Euphrates valley were not only the first builders of European and Asiatic cities, the founders of the science of government, and the discoverers of the laws of trade, but that they, as worshippers of the mother earth, were the first framers of a reasoned religion. It was they who first saw that duty was the bond that united earth and heaven together, a bond which bound men and gods alike, and who first embodied the conception they had formed of the power of heavenly influence in the deification of the moon-goddess as the queen of heaven, and the source whence the vital power residing in the earth drew its origin. (3) This con ception, which was the first sign of the spiritualizing force which henceforth formed the ruling element in religious speculation, was the work of the earliest astronomers, who first found out that the gods were not only generators, but were also gods of time, and that the productive and creative power did not reside in the earth alone, or in the earth and the male father of all beings, but in the power which framed laws to regulate the production and continuance of life. It was the law-giver who was their chief god, and their law giver was the moon-goddess. It was she who was the virgin mother, the author of law and order, who ordained the times and the seasons, and was not only the fountain of life, but the omnipotent power which fixed the bounds within which alone all created beings could live, move and have their being. Her children were the practical, inventive and silent races who imparted the blessings of civilization to mankind. It was she who was the mother of the Sindhus, now called Hindus, or children of Sin, the moon, and who are also called Mughas or Virata, while India or Sindya was the land sacred to the moon, from whose sons it derived its earliest culture. The work thus begun was continued, not only in India but in other countries, by the three lunar races called in India Kusika, the sons of Kasvapa or Takshaka, Iravata or Haihaya, and Vasuki or Vrishnis, all of which continued to look to the moon-goddess as their chief god. But all of these were apparently aided in their work by the VOL XXII.?[new series.] 31</page><page sequence="152">470 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. Northern Aryans, who called themselves the sons of speech, and who by their poetry, eloquence, energy, diplomatic ability, and warlike prowess, succeeded in obtaining complete control of all the countries in which they settled. It was they who worshipped the gods of heaven,1 and it was under their rule, or that of their congeners the Semites, that sun worship was introduced, and the sun-god made the ruling god of the solar year, in place of the older god, who, as Vishnu or Kronos, had ruled the first solar-lunar year of twelve months. APPENDIX. The following arguments will prove still more conclusively than those I have advanced in the text, that the Mughas who gave their name to Magadha were (1) an Akkadian tribe. (2) That they derived their name from Magha the mother earth, the great mother. (3) That they probably were the earliest framers of a sacred ritual within the Euphrates valley and India. (4) That they took the name Magha to distinguish themselves from the neighbouring tribes, who worshipped local deities and totems ; and (5) That the great advance in religious thought shown in the substitution of a universal and national god for tribal deities is not only a proof that its authors were the rulers of an extensive territory inhabited by many tribes, but is also one of the many proofs of the great superiority of this people over their neighbours. It was the consciousness followed by the recognition of this superiority which enabled them to organize trade, foster peace, and to impose their authority over all the countries into which they were led by their cautious love of gain. It was this spirit of adventure, coupled with their persevering energy and quick-sighted ability, which enabled them con tinually to find out new sources of profit; and these acquisi tions once made were retained by their firm determination and 1 The Druids used certainly to offer human beings to the earth, but these sacrifices were probably offered as part of the ritual which the Aryan inhabitants of Gaul and Britain derived from their Turanian predecessors.</page><page sequence="153">IDENTITY OF THE MAGI AND MAGHA. 471 their proved capacity to hold that which they had once made their own. It was these qualities and the popularity of their rule, caused by the increased prosperity of the former inhabit ants of the countries they occupied, which made the mixed Turanian or rather Dravidian race, whose home was in the Highland country to the east of the Euphrates valley, the masters and civilizers of the world. It was this race combining Northern and Southern characteristics who probably, under the name of Maghas, spread themselves over Asia, Egypt, North Africa, and Europe, and laid the foundations of law, order, and stable government in all the countries where they settled. The name Magha, which, as I have shown, still survives in India, is also found in the name of the great tribe of the Magi, the founders, not only of the religion of Zarathustra, but also, as I shall show, of the much earlier religion based on the worship of the great mother earth. Their name is only once found in the Zenda vesta, being omitted probably through the suspicions of witchcraft attaching to the name even in those early times, and which gave rise to the scorn which, as Professor Darmesteter hints, was implied in the term. In this one passage the name Moghu occurs in the phrase Moghu-tbis, meaning " Hater of the Magi." l Here the form is precisely the same as that of the Hindi word Mugha. But though the name Moghu in the Yasna means probably the Magian priests, all ancient authorities agree in saying that the tribe who gave priests to the fire and earth worshippers were also called Magi. For proof that the coincidence of the Hindu and Zend names is not merely accidental we must look to the Akkadian records. We there find that " mukhkhu," meaning the great one, was an equivalent title of the priestly order called " isippi" meaning the diviners.3 The " mukhkhu" also appears in the list of the various grades of priests named in 1 Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Introduction, iii. 16, vol. iv. Sacred Books of the East, pp. 51, 52; Mill's Yasna, lxv. 7, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxxi. p. 318. 2 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 62, note 4.</page><page sequence="154">472 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. the great epic of Gisdhubar as waiting in Hades on the great god Etanna, the god Ner, and the supreme deity Nin-ki-gal, the queen of the earth. The priests there named are (1) the lagaru or elders ; (2) the isippi or soothsayers, diviners, and the " mukhkhu " or great one; (3) the " pasisu " or anointing priests of the abysses or " apsi," who presided over the sea, or great basin of brass in which the sanctifying water of purification was kept in the temples.1 These last in the Akkadian ritual performed the same office as that entrusted in India to the priests who poured sacred butter over the offerings to the old anthropomorphic gods. Their name, " the anointer," proves that this was formerly their office; but their functions were changed when water was made the symbol of generation, production, and purifica tion, in place of the more ancient blood and fat. The "lagaru," as Dr. Sayce shows, were the Kali or Galli, the eunuch priests of the great mother earth, an order which riever passed into India. The " mukhkhu" or " isippi " were equally joined with them in the primacy. But not only the name " mukhkhu," the great one, but also the primary canons of historical interpretation prove that they must have been originally the chief priests of the great mother earth. The eunuch priests who had sacrificed themselves to her must have been an order of later date than that represented by the " mukhkhu." These last must have been the original priests of the goddess for whose service the human victims, whose sacrifice was symbolized by the act of the Galli, were annually offered in the oldest ritual. I have shown in the History of the Year2 that the oldest form of the religion of Zarathustra set forth in the Zendavesta was based on the worship of four goddesses, and the central abyss or vault of heaven called Rama, the darkness. But the priests of the mother earth were the servants of a still earlier creed, which looked on the mother earth as the supreme deity and only goddess common to all mankind. These priests were called by the Akkadians of Elam " Mukhkhu," and this is exactly 1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, pp. 62-53. 2 To be published in the July number.</page><page sequence="155">LAND OF MAGANA LAND OF THE MAGI. 473 the same word as Moghu, the title of the Mazdean priests and people, just as Ahura in Ahura Mazda is the same as the Akkadian Asari and the Hindu Asura. This likeness between the religious terminology and creed of two tribes living so near together as the Magi of Rai and the Akkadians of Elam cannot possibly be fortuitous, and the conclusion that the Akkadian " Mukhkbu " were the same people as the " Moghu" of the Zendavesta seems to me to be irresistible. It was the religion of this people disseminated by its active and energetic votaries throughout Western Asia, Egypt, and South-Eastern Europe, which took the place of the earlier and hazy conceptions of the nature of the higher powers embodied in local divinities and tribal totems. The worshippers of Mugha, who all looked on themselves as her children, called themselves after her name, just as other tribes took the name of their totems, and they also gave the name of the great mother goddess to the holy land of Magana. This name, " the land of Magana," used in the annalistic tablet recording the deeds of Narain-Sin, the son of the great Sargon,1 means the land sacred to the sky (Ana)2 and to Maga, which must mean the earth. It denotes the Sinaitic peninsula, which on account of its mineral wealth was looked on as the spot where the gifts of the mother earth were most bountifully bestowed. This sacred land, sanctified by the holy mountain of Sinai, is called the land of the goddesses Ana, heaven, and Maga, earth, showing that it was consecrated to the two great mothers; while the holy mountain, which was the sign of the pregnant mother,3 was consecrated to Sin, the moon-goddess, who was looked on as the measurer of time, and the goddess of par turition. It was in short the land sacred to the three great mothers, the holy triad of the Heaven or abyss, the Earth, and the Moon-goddess. 1 Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 31. 2 Ibid. pp. 186-187, shows that "Ana" is the Akkadian name for the god or goddess of the sky. 3 See Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Zamyad Yast, 1-7, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiii. pp. 287-289, for the list of the holy mountains, the sign of the life giving power of the mother earth.</page><page sequence="156">474 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. But before these propositions can be looked on as fully proved, the derivation and origin of the name Magha must be solved. I have already shown that Magha is used by Sanskrit writers as the name of the wife of Siva, and it is also a name of the wife of Soma the moon-god.1 The wife of Siva in India was always the mother earth, and it seems to me that the evidence proving that the name Mugha, or its linguistic equivalent, was given to the mother earth by the Akkadians and Medians, is equally conclusive with that which makes the mother earth the wife of Siva, and the first and greatest god in the Hindu Pantheon. The Akkadian word " mukh" means to bear, to increase, and " mukh" also means supreme, great.2 Now the only Joeing who can be called both "the great one" and " the bearer of offspring" must be the mother earth. It is she who, under the name Nin-ki-gal, queen of the earth,3 was the goddess served by the priests called " Mukhkhu," after her original title. In Chinese " muk " means " mother," 4 and " mu " is the Akka dian word for the female symbol. Again, in Persian, the word " magh," meaning " a channel or pit," points to an earlier form of the word with a guttural ending. This name appears in the Pahlavi Bahman Yast as that given to the stone-covered border surrounding the sacred circles, within which the nine holes, made for the purification of those defiled by contact with the dead, were dug.5 1 Bohtlingk-Roth give Harivansa, 7735, 7955, as references for the meaning Soma's wife, and for that of Siva's wife they quote the Supplement to Hema chandra's Dictionary. 2 See E-mukh-tilla, the supreme house of life, of which Merodach is said to be the lord. E (house) mukh (supreme) tilla (life) meaning that he is the lord of the mother earth. 3 Nin, the lady of the gal (spirit), see seven "galli" or seven great spirits, Sayce, Hibbert Lectures for 1887, p. 268. 4 Professor Douglas tells me that lately many Chinese words have been traced to Akkadian roots. 5 West, Pahlavi Texts, Bahman Yast, ii. 36, Sacred Books of the East, vol. v. p. 205, compared with Darmesteter's Zendavesta, Fargard la and lb, Sacred Books of the East, vol. iv. pp. 119-129, describing the Barashnum ceremony. See especially la 11, p. 122, note 4, which shows that the unclean person was to stand on the stone or hard substance placed on the "mugh," while being sprinkled with " gomez,' bull's urine, taken from six of the purifying holes, and the sancti fying water taken from the other three. The reason being that he should not defile the pure earth by the contact of his impure feet.</page><page sequence="157">THE ROOT MAG IN GREEK AND LATIN. 475 But besides the word " mogha," used in the Zendavesta to mean the Magians, the word " maga," though not in the feminine form, is used to mean the " original cause of all things." Thus in the passage in the fifth Gatha, where it is said, " King Vishtaspa has reached it (wisdom) in the realm of the great cause (Maga)," that is, in the realm of the mother earth which gives life to all things.1 It was this holy mother earth which was held to be so sacred that she must not be defiled by contact with the dead or anything impure, and it was in reverence for this great mother, who must, I submit, have been called Maga, that the fire-worshippers placed their dead in the Towers of Silence, which are built, like the " magh " of the Barashnum ceremony, to preserve the earth from pollution. Bat though the above arguments seem to me to prove con clusively that the Maga of the Hindus and Mazdeans was derived from an earlier Akkadian Maga or Makha, meaning the mother earth, yet the proof of the further extension of the word to other countries deriving their civilization from the Akkadians, and its universal and deep significance, add great additional strength to the conclusions I have put forward. All philologists connect the Greek fidyo^, meaning a Magian, or an enchanter, or wizard, with /ueya?, great,2 and the same root Mag appears in the Latin Magnus. When these words are compared with the Akkadian " makh," and the evidence I have brought forward to show the traces of Akkadian influence in Greece and Italy is considered, there can, it seems to me, be no doubt that we have here an Akka dian root which has been incorporated with Aryan languages, and that in the Greek pueya^ and in the Latin magnus there is the same allusion to the great mother earth as there is 1 Mill's Yasna, li. 16 (Gatha v.), Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxxi. p. 185, note 1. 2 The Sanskrit Maha, where the guttural is softened; but the hard guttural is retained in the holy name Magha, derived from a foreign language. In Pali Mahi means the earth, thus giving a further proof that the root Mah in Sanskrit, which appears as Meg or Mag in Greek and Latin, originally meant the mother earth, whose name was expressed by in and a guttural.</page><page sequence="158">476 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. in the Akkadian " mukhkhu." l She was the great goddess above all local gods and tribal ancestors, who could alone claim the name of the great being. The same noteworthy reverence for the great goddess appears in the Etruscan "ma;^," meaning "one." The Etruscan is, like the Akkadian, an Ugro-Finnic language, and the word ma^ is proved to have been used as meaning one from a list of numbers used on dice. In this l&amp;st the ace is called ma^,2 the great one, and the relation between the dice and the great mother is shown by the lucky throw consisting of different numbers on each die being called in Greek A^poBirrj, and in Latin Jactus Veneris.3 As Herodotus tells us that dice came from Lydia,4 it is clear that the name for the ace must have been brought by the Etruscans from Asia Minor, and that the name ma^ must therefore be of Asiatic origin, and if so it must prob ably mean the number sacred to the great mother. Similar commemoration of the deity as the mother of numbers seems to exist in the Latin unus, which is certainly very like the Akkadian an,5 meaning god or star, and does not bear any likeness to the word for one in Greek or Sanskrit. But the proof that the Magha of India are the same people as the Maghu of the Zendavesta cannot be considered complete unless it can be shown that they continued to act in India as the priests and chief worshippers of the mother earth, just as they had originally done in their Akkadian home. That they did so can, I think, be satisfac torily proved. Though not mentioned in the Rigveda under the name Magha or Magadha, for reasons I shall adduce presently, the country called Magadha is once mentioned in 1 The name also appears in the Sanskrit Maha, great, and in Mahadeva Siva, who takes the name of his wife Magha. 2 The Etruscan Numerals, by R. Brown, jun., Archaeological Review, July, 1889, pp. 390-392. 3 Liddell and Scott, s.v. acrrpdyaKos. 4 Herod, i. 94 ; and in Lydia Magnesia was the city sacred to the great mother, whose image was carved on Mount Sipylus near it.

In the South, Ushas is the mistress of the Vratya, and the Magadha their friend (mitra). In the West, Ira, that is, the purified mother of the Indra-worship pers, is their mistress, and the Magadhas their jest (hasa). In the North, lightning is their mistress, and the Magadha their thunder. The Vratya here spoken of are described by Manu as the twice-born castes, who have become Sudras by neglect of their sacred duties, and the list of Vratyas given by him shows that they comprised almost all the ruling races of the country, such as the Avantiyas of Ujen (Malwa), the Mallis, and Licchavis of Eastern India, the Kashyas of Kashmir and the Northern Punjab, and also of Kosala, where their name is preserved, not only in the name of the country, but also in that of the capital, which is Kasi or Benares, and the Dravidas of the South.7 But the name 1 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 35. 2 Atharvaveda, v. 22. 14. 3 Vajasaneya Safhhita, 30. 5 ; "heftigen geschrei" is the translation given by Zimmer, and wailing cries or lamentations by M.

Vratya is also another form of the name Virata, which is applied to the Matsyas or rulers of Western India in the Mahabharata, and which I have shown to mean the worship pers of the Viru or phallus. They were the snake-worshipping races who were descended from the five snake-kings, and who ruled all the principal kingdoms in India. From the passage in the Atharvaveda it appears that the Magadhas were the priests of the Virata kings of the East, which has always been the head-quarters of earth-worship, and it also shows that the Magadhas were a race as ubiquitous as the Virata. The magical incantations and spells here spoken of were the first attempts made both by the Indian and Akkadian ritual ists to influence the unseen powers by words. It is these spells which furnish the oldest specimens of ritualistic com position, and which were denounced by the later and purer religious reformers. It was in supersession of these early and grossly imperfect attempts that hymns and psalms of penitence, praise, prayer, and aspiration were composed by the Semite prophets of Babylon and Palestine, and the Indian Brahmins, who were the leaders in the great work of religious reform. It was they who in the West made the Magadhas of the East their jest (hasa), and it was among these Magadhas that Epic poetry, which was originally com posed with a religious purpose, began, and it was they who were always associated with the Viratas, otherwise called Danavas. The Magadhas, in short, were the Daityas, who are said in the Mahabharata to have been the ruling race who preceded the Danavas, and it was under the constellation Magha that the two Daitya mothers, Sunda and Apasunda, set forth to conquer the world.1 But the Magadhas were not only bards and religious priests, for their occupation is said in Manu to be trade.2 It was trade which brought them to India, and it was to secure the trade of the country that they placed their head quarters in a position which gave them the control of the 1 Mahabharata, Adi (Rajyalabhu) Parva, ccxii. p. 583. 2 Manu, x. 47, Biihler's translation, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxv. p. 413.</page><page sequence="161">MAGADHAS AND KUSIKAS. 479 Ganges and Jumna rivers, and which thus enabled them to rule India. But it will be asked if these people were, when the Atharva Veda was written, so powerful and respected throughout all India except the west, why are they never named in the Rigveda? These people must have been allied with the Kusikas of Kitsi, who were undoubtedly in ancient times the dominant power in Northern India. But the people men tioned in connexion with them are not called Magadhas, but Bharatas. Thus in a hymn to Indra in the Visva-Mitra, Mandala iii. 53, where Indra and Parvata are called to help the Kusikas and Bharatas, Indra is asked,1 " What help dost thou gain from the sons of the Kikatas, who do not milk their cattle nor offer hot drinks to the gods ? " Now these Kikatas are said by the commentators to be a Non-Aryan tribe living in the Magadha country, but to every one who knows Kola rian habits it is clear that they are Kolarians, as the pure Kolarians are the one agricultural tribe in India who drink no milk and never milk their cattle. These people cannot be the Mughas who gave to Indra the name of Mughavat. But we find in the Mahabharata, in the account of the birth of Jarasandha, that it was in Magadha that the union of the two tribes, the Kusikas of Kosala, and Kasi, with the Bharatas, was effected, and it was in the East that the Bharata power was strongest, and it was they who were subdued by the Kusikas. It was also in the East that the Kolarian tribes were most powerful, and it is in the country bordering on Magadha and Anga that we now find the Kol tribes the dominant race. It is therefore clear that this hymn refers to the Kusikas and Bharatas as an Eastern power. It, or at least part of it, for Grassmann shows it is a composite hymn, was written long after the war of the ten kings, for it speaks of the victory of Sudas as a matter of ancient history (v. 19). But these Bharatas were not only an Eastern power; for in the war of the ten kings it was a Bharata confederacy which was defeated by Sudas on the 1 Rig. iii. 53. 14.</page><page sequence="162">480 EARLY HISTORY OF NORTHERN INDIA. banks of the Ravi in the Northern Punjab. Now these Bharatas are clearly not only a most powerful eastern tribe, ruling in Magadha, but are also, like the Magadhas of the Atharvaveda, an ubiquitous people who are apparently the ruling race everywhere except in the West. This similarity of conditions seems to show that the Bharatas and Magadhas were the same people; but if so, why were they who were originally called Mughas called Bharatas ? I have already shown that it is probable that Mugha is derived from the Akkadian root mukh, meaning "to bear, to increase," and the Sanskrit word Bharata is derived from a root " bhri," with the same meaning. Bharati appears in the Rigveda among the three sacred mothers, Ida, Sarasvati, and Bharati; and Magha also means the great mother. In a former essay of this series * I have derived Bharata and Barata both from " bur," the Ficus Indica, and have also referred them to the Kolarian "buru," a hill, and I still think that for the unaspirated form of the word this deriva tion is correct. But though the alternative words Maga and Magha may, and I think probably do, come from a common root, yet their case is different from that of Bharata and Barata, for the first two words have been, as I suggest, transferred to Aryan languages from a language so radically different as the Dravidian; but the reasons which justify the neglect of the difference between the aspirated and un aspirated guttural in the one case, do not appear to apply to words which are only found in cognate languages, and it therefore seems unlikely that Bhar and Bar should come from the same root. I have already shown that it is most probable that the Sanskrit name Matsya is a translation of Haihaya, and that both mean " the sons of the fish," and I would in the present case suggest that it is most probable that Bharata means the sons of the increaser, the great mother, and that it is a translation of Magha, which has precisely the same meaning. This will explain why it is that the Bharatas, who appear as one of the chief ruling 1 Part II. J.R.A.S.
