In light of new evidence provided by recent excavations, I ask the question whether, or to what extent, developments in Byzantium can be associated with earlier or foreign architectural traditions. I attempt to demonstrate that there was an evolution in glassmaking techniques, and in the forms and ways glass was applied to architectural interiors.</page><page sequence="2">Windows and Their Screens in Byzantine Architecture: Coherent with an "4rchitectural-Decorative System"? About thirty years ago, during a conference on medieval glass in the Balkans, Semavi Eyice, speaking about the lighting systems in Byzantine churches, stated that the more splendid monuments must have had glass windows, and proposed the following development: colored glass with lead cames (i.e., strips) in the West; painted glass disks set in marble or wooden window screens in Byzantium; and later, during the Ottoman period, tiny painted glass panels set in stucco screens. Archaeological discoveries in the West and in the Byzantine East in the meantime have shown that the situation was, however, more complex; Byzantine craftsmen, for example, occasionally used leading, and also sometimes chose various other materials besides marble and wood to make the window screens. In light of those discoveries, a reassessment of the evidence is needed. In a 1984 essay, Eutychia Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou presented a summary of the state of scholarship on Byzantine glass. Her own contribution concerned fragments ofwindow glass found in two basilicas in Philippi that were renovated in Justinianic times.2 She noted that a few scholars have studied the use of glass in the Byzantine world, particularly with regard to a disk found at San Vitale in Ravenna (see below, pp. zo5-7 and fig. I). However, the author concluded that interest in the subject has been sporadic and that this art-historical question has never been approached in a systematic way (i.e., by evaluating the material and textual evidence that has come down to us). The use of glass in Byzantine architecture requires attention, now more than ever, not only because of the increasing number of archaeological finds from major sites of the Byzantine world, but also because we are equipped with a broader historical approach, developed by scholars of late antiquity and the early medieval West, an approach that has revealed the importance of the role played by glass window screens and by multicolored revetments in the complex arrangement of ecclesiastical decoration.3 Fig. x Fragment of cylinder glass with Christ painted in grisaille.

FRANCESCA DELL'ACQUA 194</page><page sequence="3">Window structure, although often underestimated by art historians, is of fundamental importance to the study of the fenestration and illumination of building interiors. Robert Ousterhout has recently reconsidered ecclesiastical decoration in all its aspects: from patronage to the structural conception, as well as the execution of its interior ornamentation. He stresses the importance of window glass in Byzantine buildings, even asserting that the form of windows must have been "dependent on glass technology."4 This statement reveals great sensitivity to the problems of architectural furnishing. If the glass medium influenced the shape of the windows, the form of their screens in turn affected the quality of the natural light that penetrated the interior. Likewise the shape and the number of the windows affected the appearance of the building's exterior.' Among the characteristics common to Byzantine churches in the centuries before and after the year iooo are the support system for vaulting, the exuberant presence of figural mosaics, precious marble revetments, carved chancel screens, and narrow windows containing screens with circular perforations.6 Such interiors required considerable illumination, natural or artificial, to maximize the effect of the luxurious furnishings.7 Byzantine wall structure never aimed at the "diaphanous" effects that occurred in western architecture during the Gothic age, when architects sought to transform walls into large window screens of stained glass.8 By contrast, in Middle Byzantine buildings colored glass windows were unusual. To account for their scarcity, it is necessary to consider the types of windows in their contexts, including that of the technology available over the long history of the Byzantine Empire.9 Moreover, windows and their protective screens are part of an architectonic "system," dependent upon precise structural requirements, functional as well as aesthetic.'0 Stimulated by several observations made by 4 R. G. Ousterhout, Master Builders of Byzantium (Princeton, N.J., 1999), 151 and I56. Useful comments on the location of windows and lamps, based on the aware- ness of natural and artificial light sources, were found in L. Theis, "Lampen, Leuchten, Licht," in Byzanz-Das Licht aus dem Osten: Kult und Alltag im Byzantinischen Reich vom 4. bis is.Jahrhundert, ed. C. Stiegemann (Mainz am Rhein, zoo0), 54-64. 5 In an earlier study on the Kariye Camii, Ousterhout noted how the window screens were set deep into the window embrasures, in the part closest to the interior, thereby accentuating the plastic effects on the building exterior; see R. G. Ousterhout, The Architecture of the Kariye Camii in Istanbul, DOS 25 (Washington D.C., 1987), 89. 6 Regarding the stucco screens with glass disks found in the Church of the Dormition in Gra'anica, see S. Cureid, Gracanica: King Milutin's Church and Its Place in Late Byzantine Architecture (University Park, Pa., 1979), 121. He notes that these reflect the "standard designs of the period," acknowl- edging the predominance of this type in Middle Byzantine architecture. For a useful map of the Balkans illustrating the sites where blown glass disks for windows (crown glass) have been found, see V. Han, "The Origin and Style of Medieval Glass Found in the Central Balkans,"JGS 17 (1975): 114-26. 7 The main Byzantine churches built after the 8th century did not have large glazed windows, but obviously had devices for artificial lighting. I have profited from conversations on this topic with Dr. Lioba Theis, who is currently engaged in an exhaustive analysis of natural and artificial lighting devices in Byzantine churches. 8 A. Peroni ("I1 Duomo di Trento e il mito moderno della cattedrale," in II Duomo di Trento, vol. I, Architettura e scul- tura, ed. E. Castelnuovo and A. Peroni [Trento, 1992], 34-53, esp. 42-43) has emphasized the cultural significance of the appearance and recurrence of the concept of transparency in Gothic architec- ture ("diaphane Struktur") on the part of German art historians between the two world wars. His source was Hans Jantzen (Uber den gotischen Kirchenraum, und andereAufsiitze, 2nd ed. [Berlin, I95I]). Jantzen used the term diaphane to empha- size not the intrinsic architectural orches- tration but rather the spiritual potential of the mystic space of the Gothic cathedral, a virtual non-space that could be experienced only through the emotions; for him the stained-glass windows were a colored wall. Hans Sedlmayr, on the other hand, considered stained glass windows as a muraled jewel; see his Die Entstehung der Kathedrale (Zurich, 1950). 9 See Ousterhout, Master Builders, s56 (n. 4 above). 1o Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc made a special point of studying fenestra- tion, as well as stained glass windows, as objects in their own right, apart from the structures with which they were associated. He compared his methodology to writing a treatise on the natural history of animals, presenting only a collection of ears without the head to which they belonged ("Fen&amp;tre," in Dictionnaire raisonne' de l'architecture franfaise du XIe au XVIe sitcle [Paris, 1854- 68; repr., 1967], 5:365-419, esp. 370). ENHANCING LUXURY THROUGH STAINED GLASS 195</page><page sequence="4">Ernst Kitzinger and Slobodan (ur'id, I consider here the idea ofan architectonic- decorative "system," trying to avoid the temptation to schematize a situation that changed both over time and according to geography." Only in three cases-San Vitale, the Pantokrator (Zeyrek Camii), and the Chora (Kariye Camii)-do we have proof of the introduction of figurative windows in Byzantine ecclesiastical architecture. Through the years the origin of these windows has been debated by the supporters of Byzantine primacy in the arts, who favor a Byzantine origin for stained glass, and those who firmly assert that stained glass is alien to the Byzantine tradition. Stained glass windows were clearly more common in the West, where single figures or entire narratives were assembled by expert master glaziers from colored glass panels, subsequently painted, and united by lead strips called lead cames. Yet the historical circumstances behind each of the several Byzantine instances of figurative stained glass are extraordinary (see below, pp. zo5-Io). It may be that in general Byzantine planners and patrons, even if they were aware of Western stained glass windows, were not able to replicate them, perhaps because of the lack of the necessary glass technology in the East. Another possible explanation is that they did not want stained glass windows, even if they could have had them, because glass painted with figures would have altered the equilibrium between light and dark, and also between ornamental and figurative arrangements. Whereas figurative stained glass was intensely colored, the glass disks in Byzantine windows were, with rare exceptions, pale in tone, and therefore their coloring would not have "interfered" with that of the mosaics. Furthermore, figural stained glass windows could have "competed" with the figural wall mosaics, which were designed traditionally for the representation of scenes and images. So perhaps the Byzantines did not favor windows with representations of figures, landscapes, or emblems because these could detract from the "reading" of the iconographic cycles developed in mosaic, an artistic medium that they highly appreciated.12 Window Screens in Byzantium fom the Sixth to the Eleventh Centuries One of the most important buildings erected in Constantinople during the sixth century, the church of St. Polyeuktos, built by the noblewoman Anicia Juliana, had large marble screens in the windows with rectangular openings for glass, as shown by the archaeological excavations.'3 The sculpture, the marble and mother-of-pearl revetments, the columns encrusted by glass sectile work, the mosaics, the marble window screens enclosed with large glass panels, and II Both scholars resorted to the concept of a "system" in which specific structural elements and ornamental ensembles converge, while others do not. The purpose was to demonstrate the affinities and differ- ences between the eclectic monuments of Norman Sicily and the contemporary art and architecture of Byzantium. See E. Kitzinger, "Art in Norman Sicily: Report on the Dumbarton Oaks Symposium of I98I," DOP 37 (1983): 167-70, esp. 169; idem, "Mosaic Decoration in Sicily under Roger II and the Classical Byzantine System of Church Decoration," in Italian Church Decoration of the Middle Ages and Early Renaissance: Functions, Forms and Regional Traditions; Ten Contributions to a Colloquium Held at the Villa Spelman, Florence, ed.

Kitzinger, The Mosaics ofSt. Mary's oftheAdmiral in Palermo, with a Chapter on the Architecture of the Church by Slobodan Curcic, DOS 27 (Washington, D.C., 1990), 31-34 and 66-67. My concept of an architectonic- decorative "system," in which the glass window has a precise functional and aesthetic role, grew out of conversations with Beat Brenk. It emerges from tracing evidence for the use of glass in western architecture of late antiquity and the Middle Ages on the basis of texts as well as of the monuments themselves (see Dell'Acqua, "Illuminando colorat," 161 ff. [n. 3 above]). 12 The attention paid in Byzantium to mosaics is attested by contemporary literature on the development of light aesthetics, which acknowledges that their appreciation depends on the type of illumination used, since generally mosaics are regarded in terms of their splendor. Not only the selection of colors but the very angle of placement of tesserae and other refined adjustments were designed to achieve the maximum reflective effect in mosaic revetments. See L. James, "What Colours were Byzantine Mosaics?" in Medieval Mosaics: Light, Color, Materials, ed. E. Borsook, F. Gioffredi Superbi, and G. Pagliarulo, Villa I Tatti-The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies 17 (Milan, 200ooo), 35-46, esp. 42-43; for a few of the relevant texts see E. Borsook, "Rhetoric or Reality: Mosaics as Expressions of a Metaphysical Idea," in FlorMitt 44.1 (00zooo): 2-18. 13 Anicia Juliana was related to the Theodosian imperial family, the grand- daughter of Valentinian III (the son of Galla Placidia) and Licinia Eudoxia. She was an active patron of the arts; see E. Kitzinger, "Artistic Patronage in Early Byzantium," in Committenti eproduzione artistico-letteraria nell'alto Medioevo occidentale: Settimane di Studio del Centro Italiano di Studi sull'Alto Medioevo, XXXIX, 4-o10 aprile 1991 (Spoleto, 1992), 1:33-55, esp. 44-45 and 55.J. P. Thomas (Private Religious Foundations in the Byzantine Empire, DOS 24 [Washington, D.C., 1987], 23-24) has stressed Anicia's considerable financial outlay, based entirely on her private resources, since the Theodosian family was no longer in power.

These had marble screens almost I m wide and approximately 2.5 m high. The grilles featured semicircular tops and contained rectangular and semicircular glass panels set- in nine rows. This flat glass was blown with the cylinder method, and was both clear and variously colored, in tones of dark brown, blue, olive green, and aquamarine.15 A similar screen, but of smaller size, has been found on the site of the former monastery of Constantine Lips and has been thought to be earlier than the surviving early tenth-century church (fig. 2).16 The imperial splendor that distinguished the "temple" of St. Polyeuktos was claimed in contemporary texts to have surpassed that of Solomon."7 It must have provoked Justinian, who was not of noble birth, to diminish the splendor of St. Polyeuktos by creating something even grander in the form of the church dedicated to Hagia Sophia.1" Fig. 2 Stone transenna from the church of Constantine Lips.

Some crown glass fragments have been found there, but part of them come from disturbed archaeological strata, which date possibly from late Byzantine and Ottoman times. The cylinder method consisted of collecting a mass of molten glass at the end of a long iron tube (about I to 1.45 m long, and 6-i6 mm in diameter). By blowing into the tube a cylindrical bubble was formed and then modeled by turning it on a flat stone surface. The lower end of the bubble was exposed to the heat to liquefy it, and the hole so formed was widened with a small wooden stick until it was the same diameter as the center of the bubble. Then the bubble, while still hot, was detached from the tube and enlarged at the opposite end to form a cylinder; this was then cut lengthwise with shears and put in the cooling oven to distend and flatten out. 16 T.

Chrysos [Athens, 2003], 467-80o), has again taken up the question of the deep antagonism between Justinian and Anicia, who legiti- mized her son as pretender to the throne of Byzantium. Fortunately for Justinian, Anicia's death occurred before St. Polyeuktos could be completed. Thus, instead of serving as political propaganda, it was reduced to a mausoleum. ENHANCING LUXURY THROUGH STAINED GLASS 197</page><page sequence="6">Nothing has been found of the original glazing of Hagia Sophia, although literary sources mention it. A contemporary of Justinian, Paul the Silentiary, composed a panegyric about Hagia Sophia, which he read before a large audience in the imperial palace as well as in the patriarchal palace."1 To exalt further the vision he adopted fantastic metaphors, such as the strongly lit golden mosaic of the main conch that brought tears to the eyes of the observer, creating an optical effect of gold melting downward.20 Furthermore he emphasized the great luminosity of the interior, comparing the main dome to the sky, where the numerous windows screened by glass allowed the penetration of the golden light of dawn.2" Ignatius of Smolensk, a Russian bishop who came to Constantinople in 1389 and was the first visitor to the city to have left a record of his inspection of the dome, made a precise survey of the windows, counting and measuring them. He was interested in documenting the dome's extraordinary luminosity.22 An image that suggests the form of these windows is offered by the vestibule mosaic at the southwestern end of the narthex. It represents Constantine and Justinian, on either side of the Virgin, offering her models of the city of Constantinople and of Hagia Sophia. In the image of the latter are clearly represented large quadrangular grilled screens with semicircular tops. Obviously this is a mosaic representation made in the late tenth century, long after the original construction, which may have been inflected to a considerable degree by idealization. Nevertheless this representation illustrates windows of proportions like those commonly found in late-antique public buildings.23 Martin Harrison, the excavator of St. Polyeuktos, noted an affinity between the grandiose window arrangement there and that of Hagia Sophia, describing both churches as "highly fenestrated."24 19 Prokopios and Paul the Silentiary resorted to traditional metaphors to transmit their emotional experiences of Hagia Sophia, often disclosing an interest in structural techniques, as well as a certain familiarity with actual equipment. See A. Cutler, "The Right Hand's Cunning: Craftsmanship and the Demand for Art in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages," Speculum 72.4 (1997): 971-94, esp. 976-77; R. Webb, "The Aesthetics of Sacred Space: Narrative, Metaphor, and Motion in Ekphraseis of Church Buildings," DOP 53 (1999): 59-74, esp. 70-71. zo Webb ("Aesthetics," 68-69) analyzes the rhetorical refinements used by Paul the Silentiary, Prokopios of Caesarea, and Michael the Deacon (12th c.) in descriptions of important Constantinopolitan buildings, especially Hagia Sophia and the Church of the Holy Apostles. These texts belong to the literary category ofekphraseis, which rather than mere physical descriptions are sensory experiences of an object translated into words. A. Kazhdan and A. Cutler ("Continuity and Discontinuity in Byzantine History," Byzantion 52 [1982]: 429-78, esp. 457) state that Byzantine ecphrastic texts, rather than limiting them- selves to the descriptive details of an icono- graphic program, intended to suggest in lyrical tones the beauty of a site and the uniqueness of a sacred space, and therefore it is unreasonable to expect from such literary testimonials more than what it is actually said. 21 Paul the Silentiary, Descriptio ecclesiae Sanctae Sophiae, vv. 407-1o and vv. 5o9-Ii, PG 86:2135 and 2138-39. Due to an earth- quake, part of the cupola collapsed in 558, only twenty years after its consecration. It was rebuilt of Rhodian tufa with a reduced diameter, but 7 m higher. This dome, too, was damaged by the earthquake of 989, and partially destroyed in 1346. The present cupola was financed by a special public tax instituted in 1354. 22 G. P.

Windows belonging to sixth- century buildings differed from the elon- gated type that developed in Byzantine architecture by the ninth century, when the number of windows was reduced, as well as their width, in favor of more slender proportions. Among the exceptions, there is the church of St. Catherine at Sinai (mid-6th c.) where the windows were much smaller; see W. Loerke, A. Cutler, and A. Kazhdan, "Window," ODB 3:2198-99. 24 Templefor Byzantium, 549 (n. 14 above). FRANCESCA DELL'ACQUA 198</page><page sequence="7">Large panels of colored cylinder glass, possibly intended for insertion into grilled frameworks, have been discovered at the important late-antique market city of Sardis, stored in two of the numerous shops flanking the synagogue and the gymnasium." These panes, aquamarine in color and rectangular in form, measured as much as 30 x 40 cm, and are, in some instances, rounded on one side so as to adapt to the curvature of a window with a semicircular top. They were accompanied by lead-came-like objects. Fragments of rectangular and triangular cylinder-blown panels, and their leading, unearthed on the site of the early Christian basilica near the modern museum of Philippi in Greece, also belong to the Justinianic period. This glass is delicately colored in tones of green, blue, and yellow. It seems to have come from windows with alternating panels cut in geometric shapes, the ensemble resembling contemporary examples of opus sectile.26 In some respects, they also resemble some of the earliest examples of colored-glass screens found in the medieval West, such as those of Jarrow and Wearmouth in Northumbria (7th-8th c.), which have been compared to mosaic patterns in their manner of juxtaposing variously colored geometrical elements.27 The southern bath complex of Bosra in Syria offers a clue regarding the transition between the typical late-antique window-screening device (wooden or marble quadrangular window screen with glass panes that were cylinder blown or cast in molds), and Byzantine stucco screens with circular perforations closed with crown-blown disks (fig. 3).28 The various phases of this building span a long period of time, between the Hadrianic age and the early Byzantine era, followed by the 'Umayya-d period (early znd to the 7th-8th centuries), and in fact the many windows show the remains of different kinds of screening systems.29 In the earliest windows of the Bosra baths, there are traces of double glazing, with wooden frames enclosing glass panels, whereas in the later windows one sees traces of screens made with a brick grille, in which the openings were glazed either with crown glass disks or with panels of cylinder glass. Here stucco was added to the brick to make circular openings. It remains difficult to pinpoint the exact moment marking this intermediate stage, which eventually produced the screen with circular openings, a type that spread widely throughout the Late Byzantine world.

Besides the panels with geometric patterns, another screen has been reconstructed with a holy figure on it (possibly Christ), which has caused consid- erable speculation among scholars, because so far it remains a unique example in the West, where otherwise the earliest examples of figurative window glass are Carolingian. 28 The crown method consists of blowing a glass bubble, which is then pierced, opened, and rotated on the tube until a disc is formed, the diameter of which varied according to the glass mass in hand to a maximum of I.So m. The central part of the disc, called the omphalon, or bull's eye, is very thick because it remains attached to the blowing tube during the working process. 29 H.

ENHANCING LUXURY THROUGH STAINED GLASS 199</page><page sequence="8">One of the earliest examples of this type of screen with circular openings was recently discovered at Amorium (see previous article by Lightfoot), the capital of the province of Anatolikon, in a basilica built near the center of the city toward the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century.30 It had a synthronon, colonnades between the aisles and the nave, and rich opus sectile panels on the walls and floor. The church was severely damaged by fire and partially collapsed, probably in 838, when the Arabs besieged and then sacked the city. Subsequently the church was completely rebuilt between about 85o and 950.31 In this second building campaign, the outer walls of the original structure were preserved while the interior underwent a complete rearrangement. The architects decided to replace the largely destroyed late antique colonnades with four piers that would support a dome. The interior was also decorated with new carved and painted furnishings, mosaics with gold backgrounds, and glazed stucco screens." The marble pavement was replaced with a new opus sectile floor.33 At this time, the windows were narrowed and furnished with stucco screens, through which light filtered via pale green glass disks.34 These very thin crown-glass disks, which measure approximately i8-2.o cm in diameter, are clearly linked to the Middle Byzantine reconstruction.35 All this was discovered at a level beneath the detritus that accumulated from the thirteenth century onward during the Seljuk and Ottoman occupation of the city. The church lost its original function in the late eleventh century and was subsequently used as a shelter for people and animals.36 Figs. 4-5 Fragmentary molded plaster transenna, recto and verso.

The circular openings destined to receive the glass are multilobed (figs. 4, 5), and in this respect are very similar to the oldest window screens at Hosios Loukas, Phokis, which date to the first quarter of the eleventh century (figs. 6, 7).37 The Amorium stucco screens are adorned with petaled flowers and geometrical figures, traced out with compasses and a straightedge into the dry stucco, and emphasized by strokes of reddish paint, along with deeply drilled holes into which, perhaps, was inserted glass or other colored material, all of which contributed to an intense chiaroscuro effect.

Other parallels for molded plaster screens with crown disks, although not identical in all respects, can be found in a monastery dependent upon Hosios Loukas, Hagios Nikolaos at Skripou in Boeotia, but also much later on in the church of the Dormition of the Virgin at Gra'anica in Kosovo built by King Milutin (t132I); see Cur'id, Grajanica, 61-62 and izi-zz, fig. 78 (n. 6 above). ENHANCING LUXURY THROUGH STAINED GLASS 201</page><page sequence="10">The screen type with circular openings closed by disks of colored glass is echoed in the early ninth-century Saint Zeno chapel in Santa Prassede in Rome, founded by Pope Paschal I (r. 817-8z4) as a burial chapel for his mother. A refined combination of sculpture--ancient and contemporary- along with gold background mosaics, created an ambience of great decorative richness inspired by Byzantine court art, brightened now only by a single window corresponding to a semicircular opening in the opposite wall above the entrance door. Two side windows, blocked in the fifteenth century, were covered with a mosaic revetment imitating a screen with circular openings with variously colored disks, amounting to a virtual reproduction of the disk-shaped windows that they must have replaced (figs. 8-9).38 Even if these no longer had any practical use for illumination, their similarity to actual screens had a function within the internal decorative program that still retains, in mosaic, the original pairs of holy figures piously turned toward the apertures.3 Although there is still only sporadic material evidence for the use ofwindow glass between the fourth and sixth centuries in both the East and West, and although it is difficult to trace a clear line of development, it seems likely that the Santa Prassede mosaic reproduces a type of screen widely adopted in Byzantine buildings, but rare on the Italian peninsula. In fact, as previously stated, the windows of Middle Byzantine churches were filled generally with molded plaster screens, with crown-disks inserted into circular, sometimes multilobed openings. They became common from the tenth century on. Examples of their widespread use can be seen in the Byzantine dependency of Kievan Rus', where the decorative and architectural scheme was realized in locally available materials such as wood.40 Also, in territories not directly under Byzantine rule but geographically adjacent to the empire, variations on the theme of Figs. 8-9 Saint Zeno chapel. Santa Prassede, Rome.

McClendon, "Louis the Pious, Rome and Constantinople," in Architectural Studies in Memory ofRichard Krautheimer, ed. C. L. Striker (Mainz, 1996), 103-6, esp. 104. The reproduction in paint of a false window closed with disks has been observed in a corridor of the Middle Byzantine church of the Chora (Ousterhout, Kariye Camii, fig. 94 [n. 5 above]; Ouster- hout, Master Builders, 153 [n. 4 above]). 39 Elsewhere in the building, as in the upper room of the north transept, stucco screens were employed in patterns of rows of small arches and cruciform tracery (gth c.); see L. Pani Ermini, ed., La diocesi di Roma: La IVregione ecclesiastica, Corpus della scultura altomedievale 7 (Spoleto, 1974), 130-31, who gives no measurements of these screens because of their inaccessibility. 40 Ousterhout, Master Builders, 154. FRANCESCA DELL'ACQUA 202</page><page sequence="11">transennae with circular holes are countless, although usually they were made in stone and they lacked glass panes.4' To give an idea of the diffusion of this kind of screen, one may cite a stone example in the small, narrow apse window in the remote church of San Pietro ad Oratorium near Capestrano in Adriatic Italy, dating to the twelfth century (fig. Io).42 "Variations" with Lead and Glass in Window Screening With regard to novelty and "variation" among Byzantine window screens, examples include the church of the Virgin in Studenica, Serbia, and in Lesnovo, Macedonia.43 In Studenica a peculiar glazed window, dating to the twelfth century, can still be seen in situ. It is set into a slender lancet, measuring approximately z.oo x o.8o m, and consists of a sheet of thin lead panels, pierced with tiny holes representing foliage and animals. These panels were applied to colored glass panes. Eutychia Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou points out that the Studenica window is closer to sculpture than to stained glass. In fact she believes that the Studenica screen was created by talented sculptors who were active in the church and who might have introduced this inventive "leaded and glazed" screen instead of the more common molded plaster or stone transennae with circular holes. An interesting aspect of Studenica is that the lead was not employed to connect the glass panels physically, but was an integral element of an innovative kind of decoration.44 Something similar happened at Lesnovo, in a church built around the middle of the fourteenth century. Here some of the original window screens had colored glass panels further enriched with superimposed thin lead sheets.45 There are no other known Byzantine examples comparable to the decorative patterns on these lead sheets. Mirjana Ljubinkovid ventured to compare them with art produced in southern Italy or in the region between the Rhine and the Meuse.4" Pierced lead sheets were visible until recently in the cathedrals of Palermo and Monreale in Sicily, although it is impossible to establish if these were part of the original Norman furnishing of the twelfth century.47 Fig. Io Apsidal window with stone transenna. San Pietro ad Oratorium, Capestrano, 12th century (photo by author) 41 Molded plaster screens in the windows can be numbered also among the similar elements shared by Byzantine and Islamic architecture; they imply a certain continuity between Byzantine and Ottoman building practice. Stucco window screens, with small more-or-less-circular perforations filled by glass, represent a "middle-eastern version" of stained glass, which continued in Byzantine and subsequently Ottoman territories until modern times. For Turkey see C. E. Arseven, L'Art Turc depuis son originejusqu'h nosjours (Istanbul, 1939); for the Middle East in general, H. G.

However, earlier pierced lead sheets were also found at the monastery of San Vincenzo al Volturno (south central Italy), dating to the ninth century and containing geometric patterns. They may have been used in combination with flat glass in litur- gical furnishings, such as small glazed screens or lamps (C.

In the second half of the eleventh century, in south central Italy, which had been newly conquered by the Normans, the monastery of Montecassino was the center of the largest architectural project in the area. This project is also of great importance for the history of stained glass. Leo of Ostia, in his Chronicle, mentions that Abbot Desiderius (Io58-87) summoned Constantinopolitan craftsmen to Montecassino to provide the motherhouse of the Benedictine order with the finest mosaics and opus sectile work.48 Desiderius wished to revive the golden age of Roman Christendom, which coincided with the reign of Constantine the Great. This was part of the general revival that accompanied the reform of Pope Gregory VII (d. Io85), with whom Desiderius was a close collaborator. Apparently the monastery was unable to find local artisans with the desired level of artistic skill.49 The abbot, therefore, decided to turn to Byzantium as the repository of the antique tradition. Leo says that these artisans taught the young novices the arts of"auro vel argento, aere, ferro, vitro, ebore, ligno, gipso vel lapide" ("the goldsmith's and silversmith's art, bronze casting, iron and glass working, ivory and wood carving, plaster modeling, and stone carving")."s Leo specifies that the windows of several monastery rooms had screens with either leading or molded plaster, and that the nave of the church had glass and lead screens, whereas the remaining windows had molded plaster screens.5' I believe this variety was due to a deliberate "marking" of a hierarchy of spaces, with multicolored glazed screens only in the focal windows. At the same time, the contemporaneous use of various screen types reflects the participation of different workshops or craft traditions."2 Unfortunately Montecassino has endured severe and repeated destruction, and the only form of art produced in loco that has survived from the time of Desiderius is book illumination. But since these manuscript illuminations betray no trace of "external" influence on the traditional Cassinese book style, we must deduce that the foreign artisans were selected to teach the young monks in other arts, such as mosaic, plaster, goldsmithing, ivory carving, and glassworking, as stated in the Chronicle. No traces of the window glazing at Montecassino have survived, but perhaps an echo of the stucco screens can be found in the last monument created under Desiderius's patronage-the abbey church of the monastery of San Benedetto in Capua, built during the late eleventh century. Here recent restorations have brought to light molded plaster screens, which are still in situ with their contemporary crown-blown glass. Over the centuries the screens became damaged, but they were restored during the seventeenth-century refurbishing of the building. The damaged areas of the screens were whitewashed and then painted in imitation of the missing parts; even the characteristic crown disks were reproduced by painting so that the total visual effect would be preserved (although no more light was filtering through)."53 The design of the screens is geometric in inspiration, with interlace surrounding circular holes filled with glass disks (fig. i1). The arrangement of the window screens, as well as their materials, resembles parallel examples in the Byzantine Empire and is Fig. I Molded plaster transenna with glass disks.

In fact the construction of the "new" abbey of San Vincenzo, built in the late iith century, was promoted by one of Desiderius's pupils, Abbot Gerard (Io76-IIo9)."6 Another Italian monument that has recently aroused controversy over its relevance (or not) to the Byzantine artistic world is the abbey church of the Santissima Trinita in Mileto, Calabria, founded around io8o by Robert de Grantmesnil, an abbot from Normandy who was closely related to the Hauteville family, the recent conquerors of southern Italy.57 The plan of this church has a strong French imprint, with a protruding transept and a choir with three apses of graduated size, based on the celebrated prototype of Cluny II and otherwise unprecedented in southern Italy."s The church itself is not preserved, but archaeologists have recovered fragments of the original stained glass." The glass sheets were made by the cylinder method; they are deep blue, violet, pink, and green, and painted with a dark grisaille. Among the most interesting pieces is a violet pink fragmentary pane representing an eye and part of a curly lock of hair of a size appropriate to a human figure about i m high. Those who have studied the site judged this fragment of figurative stained glass window to be a "twelfth-century Byzantine expression," and stylistic comparisons were sought in contemporary mural painting in the area.60 But the limited remains of the panel do not allow for easy comparisons, either with local figural art or with what eventually developed in the abbey. Furthermore, we know nothing about glass production in southern Italy that could be related to any Byzantine glass tradition. The Mileto stained glass evidence, found in a region that had long been under Byzantine rule, has led scholars to the same kind of debate as that regarding the Pantokrator and Chora churches: was there a tradition of figurative stained glass in the Byzantine world? Figural Stained Glass: An Occasional or Recurrent Feature in Byzantine Architecture? The earliest surviving piece from a figurative stained glass window in a Byzantine monument is a disk (fig. i) painted with an enthroned Christ from the basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, a church built under Justinian (d. 5bs). The disk has been dated to the sixth century, since it has been connected with the original decorative ensemble consisting of mosaics, opus sectile, modeled plaster, and sculpture. The disk was found at the beginning of the twentieth century in a poorly documented excavation. It has attracted the attention of Byzantinists and medievalists, most of whom regard it as "the most ancient example of stained glass."6 F. W. Deichmann is the only major scholar to have 54 In this regard, see the commentary on Leo of Ostia's text in Aceto and Lucherini, Leone Marsicano, 31.

First there is the structure of the original windows of the sixth-century San Vitale, in which the painted roundel may have been set. In fact, as accurately observed by Deichmann, these had proportions resembling those of the clerestory windows in Constantinian basilicas, which were usually closed by wooden grilles.63 Examples of these wooden grilles were found in the basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe, another Ravennate basilica financed, like San Vitale, by the banker Julianus Argentarius; their horizontal carved cornices were arranged in such a way as to accommodate rectangular glass panels, since lost (figs. 12-13).64 Therefore it is more likely that in the sixth century the large windows of San Vitale also had similar wooden grilles rather than stucco screens with circular holes holding the glass disks (as G. Bovini and other scholars imagined). Such stucco screens are actually rare in the sixth century: one example of a plaster transenna with glass disks is found in the Justinianic church of St. Catherine at Sinai, but the screen's date is disputed (fig. 14).65 Although crown glass is known since the fourth century in Roman architecture, both in the East and the West, its setting into stucco screens is not recorded before the ninth century; the earliest known example comes, as already stated, from Amorium.

FRANCESCA DELL'ACQUA 206</page><page sequence="15">Examination of the physical characteristics of the painted roundel from San Vitale reveals that it differs in color from the other disks discovered at the same site, being nearly clear instead of brightly colored. Furthermore, it lacks the characteristic central thickness of crown-glass, the residual "bull's eye" formed as the glass detaches from the pontil. This shows that the painted roundel was not blown into the form of a disk by the crown method as the others had been, but rather it was clipped with a grozing iron from a piece of cylinder glass. Scientific analyses are needed to clarify the chemical composition of the glass roundel (and also to compare it to that of the glass tesserae in the Justinianic mosaics), as well as that of the two-toned painting applied to it.66 The painted roundel exhibits a technology and style that developed long after the Justinianic age: in fact, the application of a two- or three-toned fire-tempered painting, known as grisaille, is not attested before Carolingian times, in France and in Germany (late 8th-early 9th c.). After a long process of development, grisaille fully evolved only in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries."67 I would therefore suggest for the San Vitale painted roundel a date between the ninth and the tenth century, when a Benedictine community moved onto the site and may have promoted some refurbishing of the church. The other examples of figurative stained glass belonging to the heritage of Byzantium are those uncovered in the Pantokrator and Chora churches in Constantinople, certainly among the most controversial specimens of medieval stained glass, and variously dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century.68 There are insufficient data to establish whether Constantinopolitan artisans possessed the skill and technology to make figurative stained glass framed and held together with lead cames, a type of artisanship unprecedented in the Byzantine craft tradition. In any case, the close similarities between the two sets of window glass fragments from the Pantokrator and the Chora-both churches linked to the Komnenian family-imply an exchange of master glaziers between the two projects. Before considering in detail the characteristics of the Pantokrator and the Chora stained glass in order to see possible connections with or divergences from western or eastern Mediterranean glazed screen manufacture, one should note that in the two buildings the windows were screened either with figurative stained glass or with molded plaster transennae with glass disks.69 Possibly there was an initial phase in which only stucco screens were used, and subsequently stained glass was installed according to the western fashion in the most important areas of the church, such as the apses. As for the nature of the glass material, we now know that the window glass of both the Pantokrator and the Chora reveals a durable soda-based composition that differs from the poorer-quality material generally used in Europe after the year ooo.70 One could argue that the natron-based glass of the Pantokrator and the Chora was the result of recycling Roman glass. This, in fact, would be consistent with architectural practice during the Komnenian phase of the Pantokrator, when spolia were used on a large scale.7 It also remains to be seen whether the chemical composition of the Komnenian mosaic tesserae at the Pantokrator is the same as or different from that of the glass used in the screens."72 Common sense suggests that, because of the fragility of the material, the artisans would have favored the use of flat glass available in Constantinople, rather than of glass imported from abroad. Indeed, locally produced glass sheets were employed in the thirteenth century at the Crusader fortress of Montfort in the Holy Land, where stained glass was 66 Comparative chemical analyses are needed for the various disks, as well as comparisons with the glass used for mosaic tesserae. 67 The grisaille was obtained by mixing powdered glass with an acid-urine or vinegar-which was then applied with a brush and fixed by firing. 68 See Megaw, "Notes on Recent Work"; Lafond, "Decouverte de vitraux histories" (both n. 61 above); and the recent summary of the question in F. Dell'Acqua, "The Stained-Glass Windows from the Chora and the Pantokrator Monasteries: A Byzantine Mystery?" in Restoring Byzantium: The Kariye Camii in Istanbul and the Byzantine Institute Restoration, ed. H. Klein in collab- oration with R. G. Ousterhout (New York, 2004): 68-77. 69 Some of the molded plaster screens remained in situ until modern times. A pictorial reproduction of one of them can be found in a wall painting in a passageway of the Chora architectural complex, as noted by Ousterhout, Kariye Camii, 89 and fig. 94 (n. 5 above). 70 For the most recent research, see R. H. Brill's article in this volume. 71 Martin Harrison (Templefor Byzantium, 117 [n. 14 above]) thought that the window glass fragments of St. Polyeuktos had been collected and recycled elsewhere, when the building was no longer in use. This hypothesis came from the observation that the quantity of flat glass found there appeared too limited when compared to the large size of the marble transennae in which it was originally set. 72 Many mosaic tesserae have been found amid the detritus of the church vaults, which were restored in the i8th century.

Although they are generally described as cast, my own close examination reveals that they are for the most part cut from cylinder-blown sheets of glass.74 Examples of cylinder-blown window glass dating later than the seventh century seem rare within the Byzantine world, where disks prevailed. Another important element related to the finds from the Pantokrator and the Chora, and more broadly to the history of stained glass, is the introduction of lead cames. This development profoundly changed the manufacture of glazed windows for various reasons. It is still unclear when and whether lead cames were first adopted in western Europe or in the eastern Mediterranean.75 Archaeologists have discovered lead-came-like objects at Sardis and Philippi, dating back to the sixth or seventh century, whereas the earliest western examples are dated to the late seventh or the early eighth century."76 Another feature appearing in the glass fragments from the Pantokrator and the Chora has no direct precedent in Byzantium: the use of fire-tempered painting. Some technical refinements of the painting appearing on these glasses cannot be found in the West before the ninth or tenth century, and are never found in the Eastern Mediterranean before thirteenth-century crusader examples. Although he took into account the degree of evolution of the grisaille in the fragments from the Pantokrator and the Chora, A. H. S. Megaw was induced by the archaism of some decorative patterns and the simplicity of the brush strokes to compare them all to western figurative stained glasses of the eleventh and the twelfth centuries, which were until a few years ago considered the "most ancient" Western stained glass (apart from the disk with Christ from Ravenna).77 Megaw's study concluded with the remark that these common features could validate the Byzantine origins of western stained glass.58 The painted decorative patterns on the finds at the Pantokrator and the Chora are too generic to allow for any kind of reliable comparison with western figurative stained glass. A careful checking remains to be done of the borders of western or crusader stained glass windows dating to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to understand if the Constantinopolitan patterns belong to a decorative tradition developed within the area of glass manufacture, or if they represent an attempt to apply ornamental formulas that originated in other artistic media, since figurative stained glass was apparently outside the Byzantine artistic tradition. 73 R.

From some of the rooms in the castle of Montfort, various glass fragments survive with anthropomorphic and plant motifs painted with a dark grisaille comparable to contemporary Frankish and Rhenish examples. 74 See, for example,J. Henderson and M. M.

I thank Susan Boyd, curator of the Byzantine Collection at Dumbarton Oaks, for having allowed my close examination of the fragments. 75 See D.

The earliest known example in the West comes fromJarrow in Northumbria (late 7th-early 8th c.), followed more than a century later by speci- mens from Saint-Denis, Rouen, Miistair, Farfa, and San Vincenzo al Volturno (9th c.). 76 The shape of the leading at Philippi is not the usual one for joining glass panels. Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou ("Vitraux paleochretiens A Philippes," 287-89 [n. 2 above]) writes that these lead cames were poured between glass panels: this presumes a hitherto unknown procedure. Possibly the Philippi lead strips were none other than lead from the roof. Dr. Kourkoutidou- Nikolaidou mentions them to support Megaw's hypothesis ("Notes on Recent Work," 366 [n. 65 above]) of Byzantine origins for leaded window glass, and to eliminate doubts concerning the precocious use of lead cames in the Byzantine area expressed by one of the rare scholars of Islamic transennae and "stained-glass," H. G. Franz ("Window screens als Fensterverschluss," IstMitt 8 [1958]: 65-81). My gratitude goes to Beat Brenk, who kindly furnished me with digital photo- graphs of the glass and the leading of Philippi, exhibited in the archaeological museum of Thessalonike. 77 For example, Megaw ("Notes on Recent Work," 351, fig. G) had compared the panel painted with a human eye from the Pantokrator to other "eyes" from the stained-glass windows at Augsburg, Rheims, etc. 78 Ibid., 359-62, 364, and 366. FRANCESCA DELL'ACQUA 208</page><page sequence="17">The Kyriotissa church in Constantinople, later named Kalenderhane Camii, offers an interesting comparison for the glazed windows of the Pantokrator and of the Chora. Those who have investigated the archaeology of the Kyriotissa regretted the absence ofevidence for window screens, although they thought that screens must have existed." During a partial redecoration that occurred during the Latin occupation of Constantinople in the thirteenth century, the church was furnished with frescoes representing stories of St. Francis accompanied by Latin texts, and a series of Greek patriarchs, decidedly Byzantine in character, accompanied by Greek tituli. Greek letters were also found on some window glass from the Pantokrator and the Chora (figs. Is, 16)."8 The presence of Greek texts cannot prove or disprove the collaboration of Latin artists in the decorative program at Kyriotissa, and the same is true of the Greek tituli on some of the painted glass fragments from the Chora and the Pantokrator. Instead the presence of Greek tituli on a typically western artistic medium, like the stained glass of the Chora and of the Pantokrator, should be regarded as a symptom of convergence of two different artistic cultures or a response to the specific demands of the patrons. The paintings at Kyriotissa were certainly the product of a collaboration between local and western craftsmen (figs. 17, 18), and the stained glass in the Pantokrator and the Chora may have been produced in a similar manner.

ENHANCING LUXURY THROUGH STAINED GLASS 209</page><page sequence="18">A cultural milieu favorable to this kind of interaction already existed before the Crusader occupation, during the reigns of John II Komnenos (1118-II43) and his direct descendants.81 In fact Megaw had already favored a link between the presence of stained glass in the Chora and the patronage of the sebastokrator Isaac Komnenos.82 Recently Robert Ousterhout has confirmed a Komnenian chronology for the stained glass of the Pantokrator, underlining the close links that this dynasty had with the West.83 In any case, the experimental character of the introduction of figurative stained glass windows in the Pantokrator and the Chora must be stressed.84 In sum, I believe that the figurative stained glass from the Pantokrator and the Chora was made with sheets of glass that were cylinder blown in Constantinople, using natron-based recycled Roman glass, during the twelfth century. The figurative character of the glazed screens is certainly due to the participation of Western artisans, whose presence in Constantinople might have been favored by the alliances the Komnenian emperors had with Western powers and their domains in the Levant.85 Figurative stained glass was displayed perhaps only in the most focal windows of the churches, whereas less prominent windows were screened by molded stucco screens with circular openings. Conclusions The history of glass in the Byzantine empire has been barely studied, and therefore it has been described as a "mystery" or an "enigma" by prominent scholars such as Joseph Philippe and Gladys Davidson Weinberg.86 To follow the developments and divergences of window screening in Byzantine architecture, it would be necessary to conduct an exhaustive review of all known window glass and of screens in various materials, starting from the flat glass discovered at sites dating from the sixth to ninth centuries and then continuing to the fifteenth century. Although I could not present a full survey here, my intention was to make at least a small offering to the study of the use of window glass in Byzantine architecture. I hope to have helped to illuminate "the dark side of the Moon," as Enrico Castelnuovo defined the history of stained glass in the eastern Mediterranean a few years ago.s7 -- niversitA di Salerno This essay is dedicated to Beat Brenk, to wish him "luminosi anni romani." I wish to thank Alice-Mary Talbot, Director ofByzantine Studies at Dumbarton Oaks, which gave me a Summer Fellowship to prepare my work for the excavations at Amorium (Turkey), as well as Christopher S. Lightfoot (The Metropolitan Museum of Art), the director of the excavations at Amorium, and his deputy Eric A. Ivison (College of Staten Island, N.Y.), who invited me to study the flat glass and the remains of stucco screens during the summer of zoo2 . While I was at Dumbarton Oaks, I profited from the generous collaboration of Susan Boyd and Natalia Teteriatnikov, and from the presence of Slobodan Curcid (Princeton University) and Evangelia Hadjitryphonos (European Center of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Monuments, Thessalonike). My visit to Sardis the previous year proved to be very useful, because I had the opportunity of viewing the glass sherds found there, thanks to the help of Andrew Ramage and the director of the excavations Peter H. Greenewalt (University of California at Berkeley). A meeting with Robert G. Ousterhout (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) at the Zeyrek Camii in Istanbul was also very valuable for elucidating various scientific points. Last but not least, I wish to express 81 The influence of Komnenian patronage on the urban and architectural development of the city is demonstrated by P. Magdalino, Constantinople mddie'vale: Etudes sur l'dvo- lution des structures urbaines, Travaux et memoires du Centre de Recherche d'His- toire et Civilisation de Byzance, Collkge de France, Monographies 9 (Paris, 1996), 69-76. 82 "Notes on Recent Work," 367. 83 Master Builders, I54 (n. 4 above). 84 This character, in my opinion, is matched in the case of the Pantokrator, with its unconventional, composite church plan, which is neither centralized nor longitu- dinal. Also, its opus sectile floor goes beyond standard Byzantine formulas, bearing some similarities to work by the famous Italian Cosmati. 85 Cf.
