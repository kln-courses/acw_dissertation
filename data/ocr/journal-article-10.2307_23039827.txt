<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kant's lucky accident by Ludvik Bass and Gershon Weiler 'x' I That nature is both law-following and intelligible is one of the most fundamental ideas of western science and philosophy. This idea has found various expressions in the course of history. One way of expressing the idea was to assume an anthropomorphic law-giver who had imposed his laws on nature ab initio. Another, and more interesting, doctrine was that which asserted the fundamental affinity between the knower and the known, such that the faculties of knowledge (the senses etc.) share a common nature with that which they are able to grasp and register.1 All this was tied to the notion of a cosmos (i.e. order) and the world was seen as a cosmos on account of the perfect arrangement it was thought to show. Clearly, the notions of order and arrangement are ambiguous, as they can mean, when applied to the universe, that it is law-following and that it is purposive. The doctrine of essences guaranteed that processes which are regular are also purposive insofar as they were held to aim at those specific purposes in terms of which they were defined. In this paper we shall use the term nomicality to express the law-following nature of the universe. The universe will be ' nomic' insofar as it is regular and predictable. Now, with the rise of modern science, from Galileo onwards, the concept of the nomicality of nature, which earlier theorists have implicitly formulated when propounding their doctrines just mentioned, has become urgently problematic. It was recognized that the thesis about the nomicality of nature cannot be based on a belief in purposivcness. For a physical phenomenon cannot be explained by stating the purpose of that phenomenon, since science explains types or kinds of phenomena, irrespective of the particular circumstances in which they occur; the imputation of purposiveness would normally refer to these accidental circumstances which are irrelevant to the physical description of the * The notes are on p. 58. 46</page><page sequence="2">Kant's lucky accident phenomenon. Thus a situation arose in which, so to say, the foundations of the nomicality of nature have been eliminated while the belief in nomicality itself has been strengthened more than ever before. This was due to the remarkable successes of natural science, after extending the possible range of experience by the inventions of the telescope and, especially, the microscope. The fact that science has indeed discovered powerful laws concerning the behaviour of external objects, rather than merely imposed on our thinking some arbitrary rules for the ordering of perceptions of such objects, is most strikingly demonstrated by its predictive power. Phenomena which had never been perceived hitherto have now been correctly predicted quantitively, and some phenomena, brought about on the basis of known scientific laws, had in all probability never before occurred in the universe, unless by a conscious effort of similar organisms. This predictive aspect of science is most essential. Ex post descriptive regularities, expressed in mathematical language, are a penny a dozen, and if science consisted of them alone, the ultimate discipline of all science might well be a Gestalt-psychology. It would be easy, for example, to produce an impressive mathematical formula faithfully reproducing the numbers which have come up for the past year on the roulette wheel in some reputable Casino, as a function of the times at which the throws had occurred. Not unlike some scientifically minded historians and economists, we should come to grief only when trying to use the formula for predictive purposes. That is hardly surprising in view of the fact that there is an infinity of such formulae, all fitting the past observations perfectly and all differing in their predictions. All this leaves unanswered a very interesting question : why is it that we find in fact a genuine (predictive) nomicality in nature? In attempting an answer to this question it seems useful to begin with Kant. For Kant was troubled by the very situation we have just described. Prediction depends on the systematic nature of our science over and above its containing summaries of empirically observed regularities. It would have been possible, so Kant thought, that science should not form a system. In other words, it would have been logically possible that various scientific generalisations, ordering various spheres of phenomena, should not be connectible with each other, i.e. that they should be incoherent. That science forms a coherent system cannot be derived from an analysis of the categories and forms of intuition alone. On the other hand Kant was prevented by his 47</page><page sequence="3">Ludvik Bass and Gershon Weiler acceptance of modern physical science from adopting the concept of purposiveness as a fully-fledged explanatory concept of science. And yet he recognised that science presupposes such laws as that of parsimony, continuity and unity of principles of explanation.2 He put forward the view that we can account for the remarkably systematic character of our science only under the assumption that 1 the special empirical laws . . . must be considered ... as if an understanding (although not our own) has given them for the use of our faculties of knowledge, in order to make possible a system of experience in accordance with special natural laws '.3 This is, historically speaking, a restatement of the purposiveness of nature within the conceptual framework of Newtonian mechanics. For Kant is careful to emphasise that this assumption of purposiveness—and it is no more than an assumption—cannot be used to gain knowledge, but rather is something which must be assumed in constructing science qua system. For being able to think of science as a system reinstates, in a way, the ancient doctrine about the affinity of the knower and the known. It would have been possible, and it is possible to think this without self-contradiction, that nature might have been such that no systematic science of it could be constructed by human beings. For this reason the fact that we can construct such a science appears to us ' a lucky accident which favours our intentions '.4 Kant's principle of purposiveness, as presented in the Critique of judgement, is free of any implication that there is a purpose in nature. Indeed, the very point of the principle is that to say of something that it is purposive is not to imply that it has a specific purpose but merely that it is seen as a whole, as a systematic arrangement. In this sense science is purposive since it is systematic and not a mere aggregate of logically independent empirical generalisations. And although this principle tells us more about our ways of constructing scientific theories than it tells us about nature, nevertheless it is not completely divorced from nature either. For we gain an insight into this characteristic mode of the operation of our minds precisely by reflecting on our science which is able to make true predictions about reality. Thus purposiveness can be cleansed of all anthropomorphic connotations by understanding it as systematic nomicality. In this sense, it is no more anthropomorphic to say that nature is purposive than to say that it shows order. We do not assume that the purposes are anyone's purposes any more than we assume that an order is always an order imposed by somebody. 48</page><page sequence="4">Kant's lucky accident Without such anthropomorphic notions, a purpose can be equival ently formulated in terms of a law whose operation uniquely brings about the fulfilment of the purpose; conversely, a definite law describing an orderly process has results that may be regarded as the purpose implemented by the operation of the law. Such equivalence of the causa formalis with the causa finalis is well-known in mathe matical physics (variational principles), though it remains to be investigated and discovered for each specific process. Kant's general principle of nomicality (or, in his words, of purpose fulness) of nature is a statement about our minds, not about external nature. For this reason the principle cannot tell us what specific regularities we shall actually find in specific sets of circumstances; it rather tells us how we must view and correlate specific results, what ever they happen to be. The principle is a transcendental one because it is a prerequisite to our thinking and it cannot be refuted by experience because our failure to discover nomicality in any specific instance can always be attributed to the feebleness of our reasoning rather than to the absence of nomicality in nature. The transcendental principle of nomicality asserts that men shall always presuppose order and law in nature, and study nature with a view to discovering it. As Kant noted, the transcendental principle cannot guarantee that our innate desire for finding order will always be satisfied. It would be entirely consistent with the validity of the transcendental principle if our limited intellect, though presupposing nomicality in general, were unable to discover it specifically in some portion of nature. Thus we might discover specific laws in some parts of the universe and not in others (as if there were different lawgivers in different parts of the universe) or, at some times and not at others (as if lawgivers were working shifts) or, finally, for objects of one size and mass and not for those much smaller or much larger. In order to get clear about such possibilities, it will be useful to introduce explicitly a stronger principle, which we will call the principle of simple nomicality. This principle asserts, with regard to some region of space and time, that the human observer is able to discover the nomic behaviour of events in that region. Unlike Kant's transcendental principle, the principle of simple nomicality is falsifiable by experience. It concerns not the observer alone, but the relation of the observer to nature; or, more particularly, not merely our general instinctive wishes, but our specific abilities, when faced with specific problems, to fulfil those wishes. 49 D</page><page sequence="5">Ludvik Bass and Gershon Weiler Theological language is so ingrained in our thinking that it may be useful to illustrate the two principles of nomicality by the famous jocular statement of Einstein ' the creator may be cunning, but he is not maliciousAll our previous discussion is contained in this sentence. The ' creator' stands for our a priori presupposition of order (Kant's transcendental principle). That he may be ' cunning ' ensures that that principle cannot be falsified by our experience, since we may not be able to understand him easily, or at all. That he is not malicious, however, stands for the principle of simple nomicality which asserts the nomicality which we presuppose is in fact specifically intelligible to us. Kant did not formulate the principle of simple nomicality explicitly, but he was aware that there is no a priori reason why it should be satisfied. That the principle of simple nomicality should in fact be largely valid, in fulfilment of the desire formulated in the transcendental principle, is certainly a remarkable coincidence. It is Kant's ' lucky accident' which happens to aid our understanding. Kant did not offer any reasoning to mitigate the fortuitous character of this coincidence. That is what will be attempted in the present paper on the basis of certain discoveries made since Kant wrote. Accepting Kant's transcendental principle, and taking the principle of simple nomicality to be largely valid on empirical grounds, we shall attempt to dissolve the accidental character of the coincidence between the two principles by relating it to known biological and physical theories and facts. In so far as this attempt is successful, the notion of the uniformity of nature will tend to assume an empirical character. II As a first step let us consider the immediate vicinity of the surface of the Earth during some millions of years up to the present. That portion of space and time is the theatre of our biological evolution. In it the validity of the principle of simple nomicality is guaranteed by the very existence of the human species as we know it. For, from the point of view of Darwin's theory, the recognition of reproducible cause-effect relationships and some predictive ability are pre-requisites of the survival of an organism, as complex and vulnerable as man, in which instinctive reflex is replaced by conscious deliberation. Such human mutants as had failed to discover that the principle is valid in the given evolutionary milieu were 5°</page><page sequence="6">Kant's lucky accident necessarily eliminated by an environment which to them was chaotic and unpredictable. The theory of evolution is of no avail, however, when we proceed to consider the validity of the principle of simple nomicality outside our evolutionary milieu, and with regard to objects alien to the common daily experience of the species. The observation of such objects and regions of space and time could not have been formative in the construction of the human brain. All observations through the telescope and the microscope have been made within the last few hundred years, while the time-scale of biological evolution is measured in hundreds of thousands of years. Clearly the structures and processes seen through the microscope are of crucial importance for the survival of the species; but their understanding is not. (We are not concerned here to understand facts, but to understand that understanding.) The remaining question, then, is this: why do we find the principle of simple nomicality valid also for subject-matters whose understanding did in no way form part of the evolution of our brain by natural selection? We shall consider this question in two parts. Using our necessary understanding of the evolutionary milieu as a starting point, we shall first investigate the validity of the principle of simple nomicality in the macrocosmos, i.e. with regard to the subject-matter revealed by the telescope. For the sake of brevity and conformity with usage we shall include objects of our daily experience in the macrocosmos. In the third section of this paper we shall consider the validity of the principle in the microcosmos, i.e. in the domain of structures and processes of atomic dimensions. Knowing that the validity of the principle is necessary to our physical evolutionary milieu, it will suffice for the deducing of its validity in the macrocosmos if we can show that the evolutionary milieu is a representative sample of the whole universe. All matter (in the widest sense, including e.g. radiation) in out evolutionary milieu is built up from a few species of elementary particles (nucleons, electrons, photons, mesons, etc.). There are some theoretical reasons why there should be only a jew species, but the reasons are involved and not altogether convincing; we shall therefore put this statement forward as a merely empirical one. Groups of not more than a few hundred nucleons and electrons form a small variety of relatively stable patterns known for historical reasons as atoms. In any biological context atoms (possessing sizes and structures determined in physics) are practically immutable. It is therefore economical to 5i</page><page sequence="7">Ludvik Bass and Gershon Weiler refer to them as the basic building stones of our conceptual models of organisms. To show that our milieu is representative of the whole universe, we shall argue in three steps. First, it is necessary for organic life that the milieu should contain a vast number of elementary particles. Next, the universe contains only a finite amount of matter, so that our milieu contains a finite fraction of it. And finally, matter in the universe had been thoroughly shuffled. Schrodinger5 has discussed the apparently naive question, ' Why are atoms so small?' And indeed they are very small. To give an illustration of Kelvin, take a glassful of water out of the ocean, mark the atoms, pour it back and stir the world's oceans until it is distributed uniformly throughout their widths and depths. If you dip the glass again anywhere, you may expect some hundreds of your marked atoms in the glass. To say that atoms are small means, of course, that our organism consists of a vast number of them. If it consisted of only a few, orderly life processes would be impossible.6 Sense organs would be intermittently paralysed (no replacement would be available for engaged receptors), thought processes upset at random by the passage of cosmic rays, chromosomes could not contain a hereditary code capable of a biological variation sufficient for evolution. Furthermore, individual objects of daily experience would be microscopic and therefore would behave in the erratic, unpredictable manner discussed below, so that the principle of simple nomicality could not be satisfied even in daily life. For each of these reasons only organisms containing vast numbers of atoms are capable of life. A fortiori, their milieu must contain vast numbers of elementary particles from which atoms are built up. The second (and third) steps of our argument are based on cosmological theories, which in turn are based not on observations of our milieu, but on observations made through telescopes. Thus we avoid the dangers of a circular argument. For the purposes of this paper we shall accept Einstein's theory of gravitation and his cosmology.7 The geometry of space and time is determined by the amount and distribution of matter contained in the universe. The universe at any time is finite and its size is determined by its age and its material content. We shall use the cosmological model of Eddington and Lemaitre, in which the universe was initially static, after which it began expanding. In the initial static state, the size (i.e. circum ference as traced by a light ray) was determined by the density of 52</page><page sequence="8">Kant's lucky accident matter in such a way that space could contain only a limited amount of matter, around which space would, in a manner of speaking, close itself and not admit any additions. For example, if a region of space about the size of our planetary system were filled with an incom pressible fluid of the same density as water, then that region would form a closed universe to which no further matter could be added. The amount of matter in that region is finite and our milieu contains a sizable fraction of it. There remains the possibility that different parts of the universe may contain different kinds of matter, in particular that in distant parts of the universe there may be species of elementary particles which are absent in our milieu. That this is not so we know to some extent empirically from spectral analysis of distant stars; but beyond and colliding at enormous speeds. Thus in the initial hot state of the universe that in its initial state temperature was so high that only elementary particles, but not atoms, could exist in it, rushing about and colliding at enormous speeds. Thus in the initial hot state of the universe all species of elementary particles were thoroughly mixed up and shuffled and uniformly distributed throughout the space available to them then. There is no reason to suppose that that homogeneity was disturbed by the subsequent expansion. In the alternative cosmology8 of continuous creation (steady-state theory) the uniformity of the universe is assumed explicitly from the outset. Since matter of one kind (hydrogen atoms) is being created uniformly everywhere, and all celestial bodies have arisen from it, in terms of that theory this part of our argument is obviously valid. The preceding considerations lead us to suggest that the validity of the principle of simple nomicality, i.e. a strong and empirical restatement of Kant's doctrine of purposiveness which claims to enable us to see nature as a systematic whole, is not accidental in our environment and in the macrocosmos. The principle can be deduced from a few familiar empirical facts of our existence together with some well-established theories, notably those associated with the names of Darwin and Einstein. And incidentally, this is also a restatement of the old doctrine of affinity: our brain and the rest of nature are made of the same stuff. Ill However, matters are different in the microcosmos, the world of individual atoms, to which we shall now turn. It is difficult to 53</page><page sequence="9">Ludvik Bass and Gershon Weiler think of any reason why our comprehending of regularities in the microcosmos (such as it is) should be other than strictly accidental. Such comprehending certainly is not and has never been necessary for our biological survival. On the contrary, precisely because our sense-organs are enormous in terms of atomic dimensions, it is impossible to perceive individual atoms directly. Interestingly enough, eminent scientists (Mach, Ostwald) were able to doubt the existence of atoms until the beginning of the twentieth century. Therefore the knowledge of the behaviour of individual atomic systems could have no more influence on the formation of our brain than the behaviour of stars invisible to the naked eye. Indeed our knowledge of the microcosmos has features which suggest that we understand its laws to a lesser extent and very differently from the way we understand the macrocosmos. One might even suggest that Kant's accident has in fact not occurred in respect of the relation of our brain to the microcosmos, or rather that it has occurred only to a limited degree. The objects we perceive with our senses are, in each single obser vation, resultants of very many atomic processes. The first peculiarity which we shall now note of our microscopic theories may be connected with that physiological fact: we cannot, in general, make definite quantitative predictions about future results of observations on individual atomic systems. What we can predict with a remarkable success are statistical distributions of the results of very many experiments set up in an identical manner, and performed either simultaneously or in succession. For example, the final result of a diffraction experiment with light is a definite and perfectly predictable pattern on a photographic plate, consisting of a vast number of minute spots (grains). Though we can predict the pattern, we are funda mentally unable to predict the time-order in which the spots appear on the plate.9 Generally speaking, only very large assemblages of isolated or interacting elementary particles appear to be subject to strict laws, individuals do not. This peculiarity of microscopic phenomena amounts to a severe restriction of the principle of simple nomicality, a restriction which has no counterpart in the macro cosmos. In spite of this difficulty about individuals physicists were able to assemble an extraordinary number of reliable and interesting observational facts about microscopic events. These facts can be fitted into a consistent scheme (quantum theory) which connects observations with each other and which has a great predictive power 54</page><page sequence="10">Kant's lucky accident as far as assemblages of events are concerned. And yet we cannot construct a credible and consistent picture of what is happening to single atoms or elementary particles in between observations. This peculiarity of the microcosmos has no counterpart in the large. In Reichenbach's terminology,10 our observations (i.e. planned and reproducible perceptions) constitute the world of phenomena. Our mental pictures of what happens to the objects of interest in between observations is the world of interphenomena. The latter world is, of course, devoid of any empirical basis and is a matter of pure definition, and is arbitrary except that it is somewhat limited by the demand that phenomena should fit into it smoothly, in particular without causal anomalies (effect should not precede cause, action at a distance should not be instantaneous, etc.). There is an infinity of descriptions of interphenomena, each of which descriptions is consistent with these demands; but there is one description which is distinguished by its simplicity and intellectual attraction: the normal definition of interphenomena, which is as follows, (a) The state of objects (both micro and macro) and (b) the laws of nature are the same whether the objects are observed or not, provided we make due correction for the disturbance of the object by the measurement (the disturbance itself follows the laws of nature). In the macro-world there is not the least difficulty in defining a normal picture of interphenomena. No astronomer would believe that when a star is obscured by a cloud it is following an orbit other than it would if it were visible. If one defined an abnormal picture of interphenomena, such as that the star makes loops whenever invisible, and if one succeeded in modifying accordingly other effects by which an obscured star makes itself felt (gravity, cosmic rays), no damage would be done except to simplicity. Until the nineteen-twenties scientists did not concern themselves with interphenomena but tacitly adopted for them the normal system of description. What led physicists to turn to philosophy was not the discovery (to be found in an embryonic form in Berkeley) that laws of inter phenomena have the status of definition only; it was rather the discovery, so shocking to instinct, that in the microcosmos it is impossible to define a consistent normal description of interphenomena. At least two different descriptions of interphenomena are in fact used in atomic physics, both borrowed from the phenomena of daily experience; namely, waves and particles. That these descriptions are used alternately in a somewhat erratic manner led Lawrence Bragg to make his well-known suggestion that one of them is used on 55</page><page sequence="11">Ludvik Bass and Gershon Weiler Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the other on the remaining days. Some scientists (School of Bohr) refuse to utter or hear anything about interphenomena at all,11 an attitude reminiscent of the commandment ' thou shalt not make thee any imageOthers 12 suggest a modifi cation of logic rather than of laws of nature (Reichenbach's application of three-valued logic). This last suggestion indicates into what a Wonderland science has penetrated since it left the familiar world of our evolutionary milieu. From the psychological point of view it is nearly inconceivable to abandon the normal interpretations of interphenomena in our daily life; it is also unnecessary. If interphenomena in the micro cosmos demand alternating and abnormal interpretations, three-valued logic or simply a blank, then we revert in practice to an interpretative schizophrenia which adopts one attitude to the macrocosmos and another to the microcosmos. An unpleasant difficulty arises, however, when we attempt to draw some clear boundary between these two domains. It turns out that we can draw no boundary13 (in terms of size or mass) at which the antics of unobserved objects would cease and the paradoxes of atomic interphenomena would be defeated by the solid common sense of an intellect evolved and selected by macrophenomena. (Thus a very macroscopic explosion of an atom bomb is triggered off by a single elementary particle.) The price of penetrating into the microcosmos thus seems to be the loosening of our intellectual hold on our own milieu. Returning from the microscopic Wonderland to our proper home we find the latter, to our surprise, not unlike the microscopic Wonderland. Our new, very restricted understanding of the microcosmos rebounds to cast doubt on what we had thought to be solidly determined in the macrocosmos. Some thinkers, notably Einstein,14 regard this situation as a criticism of our theories of microphenomena; his remark quoted above had also been made in that context. Others prefer to interpret the situation as the collapse of our ancient instinctive presuppositions,15 which we had developed in the very narrow theatre of our biological evolution. Thus we find a striking epistemological asymmetry between the new worlds of the telescope and of the microscope. In going to the unfamiliar limit of very distant, large and massive objects, we must modify merely laws of nature (such as the axioms of geometry), but a normal description of interphenomena is still available to us, and the principle of simple nomicality is valid without restrictions (and, we hope to have shown, by no means accidentally). In the equally 56</page><page sequence="12">Kant's lucky accident new world of microphenomena, not only the laws of nature must be modified to account for phenomena, but the normal description of interphenomena must also be abandoned. The principle of simple nomicality is valid, if at all, only accidentally. These considerations lead us to reject the view that the under standability of any part of nature follows from the sameness of stuff in the knowing brain and the known nature. For our brain and the microcosmos are of the same stuff. However, even if the strict principle of simple nomicality applies only with severe limitations to microphenomena, the more loose (transcendental) Kantian principle applies to it without difficulties. For the lucky accident of Kant was the ever-present ability we have to construct systems out of our experience and empirical generalisations. All that is different with regard to microphenomena is in the character of the system in which we order them. It is statistical. But there is no difference in its status qua system. We could therefore conclude by saying that Kant was right in postulating a transcendental principle of purposiveness insofar as it is used to account for the systematic nature of our science. And if the argument of this paper is correct then there are good empirical reasons why a stricter version of it, which we have called the principle of simple nomicality, should be empirically true in the macrocosmos. What is remarkable and truly accidental is that after an evolutionary schooling in the macrocosmos we are still able to make systematic sense of the microcosmos. That our systematisations of the microcosmos are so beset with interpretative difficulties and uncertainties may well be due to our biological unpreparedness. Or alternatively, if we reflect on our success in these difficult fields of research, we may well doubt whether our cognitive machinery is wholly explicable in terms of the evolutionary process. 57</page><page sequence="13">Notes 1.
