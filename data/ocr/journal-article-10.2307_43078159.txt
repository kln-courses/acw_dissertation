XVII-XXVII) Nicolò Marchetti Antonia Ciasca in memoriam 1. Introduction Since the first comprehensive study on Anatolian lead figurines2, sig- nificant new evidence has become available concerning the last phase of their production, which represents their floruit as far as spatial distribution is concerned, and also because of the greater complexity of the ico- nographie structure and symbolic meaning they show. In particular, it seems now possible to draw some lines of interpretation concerning the identification of the main workshops of origin, the circulation of moulds and lead figurines and also the significance of this peculiar class, as it stands out when compared with similar contemporary classes of objects from the Levant. Excavated pieces represent a fundamental point of refer- ence in such an enquiry, although it is only iconographie and stylistic anal- ysis of a sufficiently large group of objects that can substantiate the identi- fication - tentative as it may be - of a given manufacturing center and of its workshops3. 1 For permission to study unpublished materials and for supplying their photographs, I wish to thank Michele Piccirillo, o.f.m., Director of the Museum of the Studium Biblicum Francisca- num, for mould SF7595 (fig. 2); Annie Caubet, Conservateur Général at the Département des Antiquités Orientales - Musée du Louvre, for mould A026512 (fig. 10); Paolo Matthiae, Direc- tor of the Italian Archaeological Expedition at Ebla, for figurine TM.00.Q.30 (fig. 46). I am grateful to Liliana Donda for having drawn the above mentioned pieces (figs. B, C, G). Thanks are also due to Leo Arnold, SJ for revising the English of the present article. 2 See Emre 1971, with earlier bibliography on the subject and a thorough catalogue of the pieces known at the time, which will be here quoted, in most cases, according to that edition only. 3 The chronological terminology adopted here follows that employed in Syria: more specifi- cally, for the Early Bronze Age, the north-eastern Syrian terminology is used (Marchetti 1998: 115-116, table 1), while for the Middle Bronze Age the north-Syrian one is employed (see here Table 1 and Marchetti 2000b: table 1; id. 2001: 10-16, 173-175, tables 2.2, 3.1; Marchetti - Nigro 1997: 38-40, table 1; eid. 2000: 282-284, table 1). For the Anatolian area, the Early Bronze HIB period corresponds to Early Bronze IV of the Jazirah (see e.g. Mellink 1992: table 3).</page><page sequence="2">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 391 The marked increase in metallurgical production which took place in the Levant and Anatolia during Early Bronze IV also entailed the extended use of open moulds4. Among these, moulds for jewels are characteristic, being attested to from Mesopotamia to central Anatolia, often also pre- senting a standing female figure, in most cases nude with hands holding the breasts5. It appears that this production was already started by at least the end of the Early Bronze III period6. A few pieces belong to the Middle Bronze I period (for which see Ta- ble 1) and among the stones in which they were made, steatite and serpen- tine are prevalent, as in Early Bronze IV7. The earliest specimens seem to 4 At Tell Brak/Nagar and at Tell Chagar Bazar there have been found, for example, several sandstone or basalt moulds in "Akkadian" levels (i.e. from the beginning of Early Bronze IV): most of the moulds were for casting tools (Oates - Oates 1991: pl. XXIXc; D. Oates 1985: pl. XXIXe from Brak; see McDonald et al. 2001: 247-248, 254, figs. 268-270), among which chisels are frequent (Mallowan 1947: pl. XXIXA; Oates - Oates 1991: pl. XXIXa from Brak; Mallowan 1937: 153, pl. XVIIIB from Chagar Bazar). Concerning the greater frequency of hoards of metal objects during the Akkadian period, see Marchetti 1996: 105-109. 5 The relevant documentation has been studied by Emre (1971: 121-130, pls. I-III: 1), with specimens stretching from Abu Habbah/Sippar in southern Mesopotamia to Akhisar in western Anatolia; Emre (1971: pls. I: 1, II: 2, fig. 11) has also attributed to this group two Anatolian lead figurines (the first one from Hisarlik/Troy), confirming the early use of that metal at least for this peculiar class of objects (see also below). To this group can now be added two pieces from Tell Brak, a mould (Oates 1987: 190, pl. XXXVIIIc; Oates 1990: 146, pl. 14: 3-4; McDonald et al. 2001: 248, 254, fig. 267, where the mould is said to come from the surface of Area FS) and a lead figurine (Oates 1990: 146, pl. 15.1), coming from levels 2-1 of Area FS, which are dated to the "Post- Akkadian" period, i.e. to later Early Bronze IV (a slightly later dating proposed by the exca- vators, also on the basis of the dating attributed by them to the lead figurine, does not seem neces- sary: Oates - Oates 1993 : 167; see also Oates et al. 1997 : 141, fig. 163, where the figurine is said to come from the surface of Area FS; J. Aruz in Aruz - Wallenfels 2003 : 257-258, no. 163a). A frag- mentary bronze or copper figurine, representing a female with hands at the breasts and possibly cast, found on the surface of Area CH, is attributed to Early Bronze IV (McDonald et al. 2001: 242, 253, fig. 263). The presence of similar moulds for jewels at Tell Brak (Oates 1987: pl. XXXVIIIc; Oates 1990: pl. 14: 3-4) and at Aššur, Ištar Temple G (Andrae 1922: 84, no. 122, pl. 29p), hints at a serial production at the end of Early Bronze III and the beginning of IV (com- pare also three other moulds from Aššur: Andrae 1922: 84, nos. 123-125, the latter almost identical with the above-mentioned Brak specimen; Wartke 1980: 226-228, nos. 1-3, figs. 3-5); a lead pen- dant, representing a bull and cast in one of those moulds, has been found at Tell Brak in a context dating from the beginning of Early Bronze IV ("Akkadian": Mallowan 1947: 170, pl. XXXII: 1). 6 A mould, seemingly oí steatite, from Titns Hoyuk on the Upper Euphrates, comes rrom a "Late EBA" context (H. Pittman in Matney et al. 1997: 68-69, figs. 19-20), equated by the exca- vators with the end of Kurban IVA (Matney et al. 1997: 65-66; see ibid., figs. 10-11, 15, 17-18 for the pottery of that phase), the materials of which (Algaze 1990: figs. 64-67, pls. 55-56, 67-68, 80, 83, 94, and pp. 185-190, figs. 122, 134), however, correspond to the end of Early Bronze III (to which date Khuera ID, Brak CH 5, Selenkahiya 5, Mardikh IIB1 and Hama J5; see Marchetti 1998: table 1 for these correlations), Early Bronze IV being represented by Kurban III. The Titris specimen thus seems to represent the earliest occurrence of this kind of mould, coming from a late Early Bronze III context, an aspect not fully appreciated by its editor (and also by J. Aruz in Aruz - Wallenfels 2003: 257-258, no. 163b). 7 The height of the complete specimens mostly varies between 5 and 7 cm. As far as the technique for the production of Middle Bronze figurines is concerned, they were cast on carved moulds which were either of the early open type or, in some cases, closed with a plain lid of sim- ilar shape, as some specimens from late Middle Bronze I and early Middle Bronze II periods dis- covered with their lids attest to (Emre 1971: pls. IV: 2, VIII: 1 and IX: 1), or as the presence of holes on the moulds suggests (Emre 1971: pls. IX: 2, XI: 1, 4). In most of Early Bronze IV</page><page sequence="3">392 Nicolò Marchetti date on stylistic grounds from early Middle Bronze I and come from the mound of Kültepe/Kanes and from Acemhöyük/Purushanda level IV8: two almost identical lead figurines represent a couple with a smaller nude fe- male figurine in the middle; the hair tresses of the larger nude female are still close to those found in the group from the end of the third millennium BC. Three lead figurines, more naturalistic, can be attributed on stratigraph- ical grounds to the end of Middle Bronze I9. The first one, coming from Kiiltepe kãrum II, represents a female (apparently nude like in the older group) with an elaborate coiffure and the hands holding her breasts10. The two other figurines come from Alishar Höyük and represent a male with fluted conical cap and a naked body with a sword or a narrow belt obliqu- ely on the hips and a vertical herring-bone pattern on the chest, which seems to represent the ribs and not a symbol or a dress; one of them holds a vertical object in the left hand11. A characteristic series of moulds with schematic representations, dat- ing from not earlier than the central phase of Middle Bronze I and made in common stones or even in terracotta, includes three specimens with a schematic figure with two caprids at the sides, representing either a nude male with conical hat holding standards with a bird on its top or an appar- ently nude female with sword holding two caprids; on the back of one of them a triad over a four-legged checkered platform is figured12. A lime- moulds the nude female figure is associated with jewels representing, among others, elements or animals (e.g. stars, doves or lions) which are, in second millennium bc Syria, symbolically asso- ciated with a goddess (see Marchetti - Nigro 1997 for discussion of the evidence). Although their subject seems somehow related, metal figurines of nude women from the princely tombs of cen- tral Anatolia were made in different styles and techniques (Kulaçoglu 1992: figs. 97-104). 8Emre 1971: 131-133; for the piece from Kültepe see ibid., p. 114, no. 42, 131, fig. 12, pl. Ill: 2, for that from Acemhöyük p. 101, no.l, fig. 13, pl. Ill: 3 (Ózgiiç 1966: 50-52, pl. XXIV, where it is also stated that Acemhöyük IV corresponds to Kültepe kãrum IV-III). 9 It seems likely that these figurines were cast from steatite or serpentine moulds, since these materials are attested to in the preceding and in the following phases. 10 Emre 1971: 107, no. 23, 138, fig. 21, pl. V: 1. 11 Emre 1971: 102, nos. 4-5, figs. 18-19, pl. V: 3-4; Emre favours a dating towards the end of the Middle Bronze I period, either on stratigraphical grounds (ibid., pp. 92, 137 establishes the correspondence of their retrieval contexts with level 1 IT of the site), and because of the compari- son with ibid., pl. IV: 1 from Bogazköy (which, however, comes from a context dating from the beginning of early Middle Bronze II, see the following note). 12 Emre 1971: 134-137; for the mould from Kültepe kãrum II see ibid., pp. 106-107, no. 22, fig. 15, pl. IV: 2; for the Anatolian clay mould with two carved sides, of which one is very simi- lar to the one from Kültepe, see ibid., p. 114, no. 43 fig. 17a-b, pl. IV: 3a-b; for the Bogazköy specimen see ibid., p. 105, no. 15, fig. 16, pl. IV: 1 (Boehmer 1972: 217, no. 2215, pl. LXXXV: 2215, from "Unterstadt" level 4 corresponding to the first part of Kültepe kãrum lb, thus being possibly an heirloom, but see below notes 11 and 47). One should note that since in the following period it is always a male figure holding the animals, its identification as a female in the latter piece may be questioned; compare also the two male figurines with sword from Alishar Höyük (for which see note 12). Two lead checkered platforms have been found at Acemhöyük (Emre 1971: 137, pl. XII: 5) and Kültepe (ibid., p. 162, pl. XII: 6, with the remains of the feet of three figures on one side).</page><page sequence="4">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 393 stone mould with a schematic sitting musician playing a harp ending in a bull-head has been found in level III at Acemhöyük13, while from Kiiltepe kãrum II comes a mould representing what is possibly a hybrid creature on a patterned pedestal and a schematic anthropomorphic lead figurine14.

The early Middle Bronze II workshops During early Middle Bronze II (see Table 1) lead figurines and their moulds are known in much greater numbers than in the preceding period (fifty specimens are discussed below). Accordingly, it seems possible to identify regional centres of production and to better evaluate the direction and extension of trade routes through the distribution of the pieces of the various workshops so singled out (fig. A). The dating is based upon more than twenty stratified pieces, coming from early Middle Bronze II contexts, Fig. A - Map showing the distribution of early Middle Bronze II lead figurines and their moulds and including the main Middle Bronze Age sites (T. = Tell, H. = Höyük; in italics the ancient name of the town); Karahöyük (F 1) lies southwest of Acemhöyük outside the map. Beside each site, there follows and indication of how many pieces of a given workshop were found there: Aa = Kültepe classic group; Ab = Kültepe elegant; B = Alishar; C = south-eastern Anatolian; D = varia Anatolian; E = "master of animals"; F = Eblaite; G = north Mesopotamian.</page><page sequence="6">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 395 while the rest is assigned to this period on comparative and stylistic grounds. The stones in which the moulds are made are steatite and serpen- tine, the former almost twice as frequent as the latter15. Kültepe is the site which has yielded the richest material: four lead figurines and nine moulds belong to the phase of its kãrum level lb (of these one mould is actually a surface find). Among contemporary pieces of Anatolian provenance, in ad- dition to two moulds also allegedly from Kültepe, seven figurines and one mould have been found at Alishar Höyük, respectively five and three fig- urines at Bogazköy and Karahöyük, finds of single lead figurines have been made at Kizilhamza and Acemhöyük16; in Syria the site with the most sig- nificant documentation is Tell Mardikh (two figurines and a mould), one figurine at each site has been retrieved at Zincirli, Tell Judaidah, Knaye and Tell Umm el-Marra; in northern Mesopotamia, one figurine at each site has been found at Tell Chagar Bazar, Tell al-Rimah, Nineveh and Khafajah. 2.1. The Kültepe workshops: the "classic" and the "elegant" groups The main group, represented by seven moulds (among those of Ana- tolian provenance, three come from Kültepe and one from Alishar Höyük) and a lead figurine, is characterized by small moulds with convex back on which is carved a standing couple, wearing dresses open at the front and marked by parallel, approximately horizonal, lines (figs. 1-8) 17 : the male bearded figure wears a high conical fluted cap and holds a spear and an axe or an animal standard ending in a caprid or a bird, the female holds her breasts or a child18; in five cases, between the two main personages there is a rampant caprid19. Iconographie peculiarities of this group are rep- 15 Steatite is attested to in fourteen cases (actually a mould in the Borowski collection is de- scribed as being made of schist, though it rather seems more likely that it is made of steatite), serpentine in six and green stone in two, the latter, however, being probably an inaccurate in- dication for serpentine; only one mould, from Kültepe, is made of sandstone. 16 See Ozgiiç 1966: 32-35, 49-52 and Boehmer - Güterbock 1987: 33-34 for the relative stra- tigraphie dating between Kültepe kãrum lb, Acemhöyük II-I and Karahöyük I (see also Mellink 1992: 219-220). For some comments on the relative stratigraphy of the other sites, see below. 17 Kültepe kãrum Ib: Emre 1971: 108-109, nos. 27 and 30, fig. 22, pls. VI: 3, VII: 2; ead. 1993: 171-173, fig. 3, pl. 33: 1; Alishar: Emre 1971: 102, no. 6, pl. VI: 1; other specimens: ibid., pp. 115-116, nos. 46-47, fig. 22, pls. VI: 4-5. 18 The sex of this child is uncertain: in one case the child, with arms on its chest, wears a cap similar to that of the male figure (fig. 5), while in the others it has a simple hairstyle: only in one specimen, where the female holds a baby, a standing girl seems to be represented; this is more based on the comparison with a piece from Kizilhamza discussed below (see note 35), rather than for the arms on the chest and the necklaces. 19 The term caprid, throughout this article, is simply used as a synonym for stag, goat, ga- zelle or antelope (all these terms have been variously employed by scholars), and thus does not imply a precise identification of the species of the animal illustrated in each case.</page><page sequence="7">396 Nicolò Marchetti resented by the large schematic ears of the male figure, by the shape of his belt and by the elaborate cap of the female personage. A lead figurine be- longing to this group, representing a male armed figure, has been found in northern Syria at Tell Judaidah (fig. 8)20, while a steatite mould has been found at Knaye in Syria (figs. B, 2a-b)21. Another mould from Kültepe Fig. B - Steatite mould, h. 6.2 cm, surface find from Knaye (SF7595); scale left 1 : 2, right 1:1. 20 The figurine (Emre 1971: 109-110, no. 31, pl. VI: 2) comes from a context dating from Iron II, rather than from Middle Bronze Age as maintained by Emre (1971: 96, 109, where none- theless the context is correctly said to date from 'Amuq O), although at that time the final report on later 'Amuq architecture, where level 7 in squares D-F 7-10 (the figurine comes from square F-8) is attributed to Iron II, Period O of the site (Haines 1971: 29-30 and table at p. 2), was not yet available. 21 The steatite mould in the Hierosolymitan Museum of the Studium Biblicum Francisca- num, hitherto unpublished, is recorded as being from Knaye, a village in northern Inner Syria on the lower flanks of Jebel Ansariyah looking towards the Orontes Valley, the Ghab; the mea- surements of the object, brought to the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in 1929 and at some time registered in the museum collections as SF7595, are the following: h. 6.2, w. 4.6, th. 1.5 cm. The mould is lozenge-shaped, with convex back and slightly tapering sides, and it is well pre- served apart from two broken opposite corners. Two standing figures, male and female, are carved on it: between them there is a rampant caprid facing backwards and resting its fore- quarters on the hip of the female figure. The head of the latter is almost completely lost, except for three horizontal lines belonging to the head-dress and for the lower left portion of the face. A multiple flat band is represented on the neck, while the hands are holding the breasts, under which there is a dress open at the front and marked by parallel oblique lines. The male figure has a conical cap with flaring top and a herring-bone relief pattern of incised lines, marked eyes, nose and ears and a pointed chin with small flaring beard. The hands hold a short spear with tri- angular head and a curved standard with the top represented by a bird with open wings and large tail. The dress is similar to that of the female, though shorter and fastened by a belt. The feet of both figures, with toes represented by thin incisions, are hewn on the short vertical side of the mould and so were protruding in the cast; after the melting of the metal, they probably became part of a base on which also the back hindquarters (reduced to a single limb) of the caprid rested.</page><page sequence="8">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 397 kãrum lb belongs stylistically to this same group: a winged male figure with horned cap is represented together with a female with hands at the breasts (fig. II)22. Apart from the slightly more elaborate cap of the female and the wings of the male figures (the latter feature indicating that a dif- ferent personage from the one holding a standard and a weapon is depicted here), the main diversity is represented by the horns, a feature also attested to in the "elegant" group (for which see below), but from which it is sep- arated by the straight, non-sinuous profile of bodies and wings. A peculiar iconography is represented by a lead male figurine with the otherwise characteristic conical cap, large ears and flaring beard but holding against the shoulders two standards depicting children (fig. 12)23. Two moulds, whose provenance is unknown, on exhibit in the Louvre Museum, present the same subject as the main group, although they differ in some ico- nographical details (figs. C, 9-10)24: the top of the cap of the male figure Fig. C - Serpentine mould, h. 5.9 cm, allegedly from Iran (A026512); scale 1:1. 22 Emre 1971: 109, no. 29, fig. 29, pl. VIII: 1. Some minor divergences from the other speci- mens consist in the presence of the breast and in the absence of the belt on the male figure and in the rendering of the dresses, with a slightly more elaborate central motif in both cases and in the pattern on the sides of the woman's dress. 23 Emre 1993: 174, fig. 5, pl. 33: 2. 24 For the first steatite object (A015554) see Emre 1971: 116, no. 48, pl. VII: 1. The mea- surements of the second mould (A026512, roughly lozenge-shaped, with slightly convex back and rounded sides), made of greenish serpentine and allegedly from Iran (it was donated by M. Foroughi), are: h. 5.9, w. 4.1, th. 1.7 cm. The standing male figure, with pointed chin and small flaring beard, holds a spear and the female her breasts, the fluted hat of the male has a flat- tened top, while that of the female has a notched border, the dresses have two vertical incisions at the front and are marked by parallel oblique lines; between them there is a schematic rampant ca- prid, resting its forequarters on the hip of the female figure and with a thin body marked by par-</page><page sequence="9">398 Nicolò Marchetti is flattened, that of the female figure has a different shape and, in the first specimen, the dress of the female and of the child are slightly different. Notwithstanding these minor differences, the overall similarity of these two pieces suggests that they should be considered together with the main se- ries, although they were probably made in another workshop. The number of pieces belonging to this group, the uniformity of many iconographical features, in addition to their clear stylistic homogeneity, make it possible to identify a workshop that we call here the "classic" group because of its size and representativity, located in Kültepe since this site has given three moulds of the main series and two other related speci- mens with slightly different iconographies but similar stylistic traits (one can also compare figs. 33 and 35, discussed below). The second characteristic group was probably also made in a work- shop at Kültepe kãrum lb, since this site has yielded two (and a third piece is allegedly from this same site) out of the six specimens here attributed to this series and also because of the resemblance of some of its features with the preceding group (such as the shape of the belt and that of eyes and nose, while the ears are smaller and the beard is not flaring but straight). Two figurines found at Bogazköy/Hattusa (figs. 15-16), of which one is from "Unterstadt" level 4, corresponding to Büyükkale IVd and ap- parently ending before Kültepe kãrum lb, are very similar to one from Kültepe (fig. 14) and represent a standing bearded figure holding an axe, with a conical fluted cap (which is lower than in the preceding group) and wearing a mantle on the left shoulder and a kilt (held by the usual belt) with a herring-bone pattern (single or multiple) on the bottom and a verti- cal fringe in the middle25. This same dress is worn on a remarkable mould from Kültepe kãrum lb by a winged figure with one open arm, which stands on a cross-hatched platform with four legs (flg. 13)26. The above- mentioned specimens share a squared beard, rendered by an alternating herring-bone pattern. The figure on the mould has in addition a horned conical cap and some curls at the side of its face, as in another figurine from Zincirli with wings of plastic style found at a great depth (fig. 18), where however the horns are on the front of the hour-glass shaped fluted allei lines. The back of the mould has also been secundarily put to use as a stamp seal with a mo- tif of incised hatchings and a drilled hole for suspension; if the alleged provenance of the object is reliable, this later change of usage may perhaps have been carried out in Iran during the Iron Age on an older, imported object. 25 Bogazköy: Emre 1971: 105, nos. 16-17, figs. 27, 26, pl.

The plastic ren- dering of the faces of these two latter pieces is reminiscent of a lead fig- urine (fig. 17), allegedly coming from Kültepe, in which the lower part of the beard is representd by curls and the dress has a decorated border on one side, two features not attested to in artifacts of this kind but compara- ble with those of contemporary monumental statuary (for which see § 4)28. Two small horns are represented at the sides of the cap, in which the small upper knob is similar to that of the Zincirli figurine (although the herring- bone pattern decorating it is without parallel, apart from the partially simi- lar horned cap of fig. 11) and the position of the open right arm to that of the Kültepe mould. Admittedly, this group is more varied than the preceding one, but only as far as some minor elements are concerned. Because of the plasticity with which faces and wings are rendered and the careful execution of the details this group seems a unitary one and is here called the Kültepe "elegant" group. Another characteristic of this series is possibly the fact that single figures were represented, at least as far as winged figures are concerned. 2.2. The "Alishar" group The site of Alishar Höyük (possibly ancient Amkuwa) has yielded five characteristic lead figurines, which are similar to a mould and a fig- urine from Kültepe kãrum lb29. The number of pieces from Alishar shows that they may originate from this site, as do the iconographie differences in respect of the two Kültepe groups described above. In the only couple be- longing to this group there is a male figure with a horned flattened cap holding an axe and a standing female with cap decorated by multiple trian- gles, simple necklace and herring-bone patterned dress below the joined hands (fig. 19); the kilt of the male figure is characteristic, having a central fringe and a lower band, which can be compared with that of the "elegant" group from Kültepe, as well as the mantle covering the left shoulder and the right arm extended outwards30.

A mould from Kültepe represents a fe- male figure with hands at the breasts wearing a cap decorated by crossed lines and dots and a robe divided into bands filled with alternating hatch- ings, standing in front of a donkey mounted by a small male figure wear- ing a fluted conical cap and a dress of similar style (fig. 21); a lead fig- urine from this same site represents the lower part of a seemingly female figure dressed with the same robe (fig. 22)32. Finally, two female figurines with hands at the breasts have the characteristic elaborate cap, decorated by dots and also, in the second case, chevrons (figs. 24-25); the latter is nude, while the former has the characteristic robe of this group but open on one side33. A lead couple from Acemhöyük possibly also belongs to this series, which is here called the "Alishar" group (fig. D)34.

The south-eastern Anatolian workshops Two lead figurines from Bogazköy and Kizilhamza, west of Ortaköy/ Sapinuwa, seem to belong to a distinct group (figs. 26-27), though related to the previous one35. The second piece represents a male figure (with a flat or broken cap) holding two weapons and a female holding one breast, while her left arm extends towards the right hip and a central small nude female figure36. The robes are divided into bands of alternating height, re- calling, besides a figurine from Bogazköy (for which see note 49, fig. 39), some of those of the main south-eastern Anatolian group, to which it is re- lated (see below). The origin of this small group, despite the contexts it was found in, thus seems to be somewhere south(-east) of Kültepe. The same can be said for a mould of uncertain provenance where probably two females with hands on the abdomen are represented: around them there is an arch and between them a child (fig. 28)37. From the iconographie point of view the piece is peculiar, because two standing females are not attested to elsewhere in the Anatolian production (apart possibly from a piece from Bogazköy cited below, fig. 39). A coherent series is formed by three pieces representing couples, where the male figure wears the typical belt of the Kültepe "classic" group and the female holds one breast with one hand and a child with the other: the style is linear and more schematic than the Kültepe groups. In the first piece, a fragmentary mould from Tell Chagar Bazar, there also appears an object which has been interpreted as an Egyptianizing ' ankh symbol (fig. 29), which would be related to the diffusion of Egyptian motifs in the visual arts of later Middle Bronze cultures from the Levant38: however, it ion on the style (Toklu 1976: fig. 1). The piece represents a couple with dresses similar to the above-mentioned specimens; the male figure, seemingly wearing a fluted cap, holds an axe and a scepter. 35 For Bogazköy see Emre 1971: 104-105, no. 14, fig. 14, pl. Ill: 4 (Boehmer 1972: 164, no. 1709, pl. LIX: 1709); for Kizilhamza see Emre 1993: 174-176, fig. 6, pl. 33: 3. According to Emre (1993: 176), who first recognized their affinities, these two pieces would only be slightly later than the early triadic groups from Kültepe and Acemhöyük IV (see above, § 2). However, there is no real reason for such an early dating: the elaborate features of the dresses rather hint at a dating contemporary with the main groups of Alishar Höyük and Kültepe, among which in fact the triadic type is still attested to. 36 For parallels to the asymmetric position of the arms of the female figurine in the Kizil- hamza triad, see Marchetti 2000a: 124-125, note 24. 37 Emre 1971: 117, no. 50, pl. XI: 1; the identification of the sex is based on the absence of the beard and on the multiple necklaces worn by the two figures (compare e.g. ibid., pl. VIII: la), although the fluted caps are rather typical of males. The identification of the sex of the small cen- tral figure is based on the comparisons with the Kizilhamza triad and the mould in the Bible Lands Museum (for which see below). The arch recalls that of the mould illustrated in fig. 43 (which, significantly, also has two holes for fixing the lid, a technique different from most Ana- tolian moulds). 38 Emre 1971: 105-106, no. 18, pl.

This latter figurine, headless and representing a couple, has been found in the Middle Bronze II palace of Tell al-Rimah (probably ancient Qattarã): the left-hand figure, a male because of its typical belt, has a horizontally flounced dress and arms on the chest, the female wears a peculiar dress di- vided into oblique bands filled with dots and in the middle there is a verti- cal element (fig. E)39. A lead figurine, representing a female holding a child, has been found at Tell Mardikh/Ebla (fig. 30) and closely resembles the one from Chagar Bazar40. The style of these three pieces, which have internal similarities suffi- ciently close to lead one to think that they were made in the same work- shop, and their distribution point towards a south-eastern Anatolian origin, farther south(-east) than Kültepe, although a site like Tell Chagar Bazar cannot be ruled out altogether. Fig. E - Lead figurine, h. 3.8 cm, from fill in the Palace area, Tell al-Rimah (Howard-Carter 1998: pl. 21, fig. 3); scale 1:1. i.e. to the main structural level dated by the retrieval of cuneform tablets from the time of Sham- shi-Addu, ibid., 114, figs. 5-6). 39 Howard-Carter 1998: 109-113, pl. 21, fig. 3; the figurine comes from an "unstratified fill in the palace" (see Oates 1972: 85-86 for the stratigraphy of the palace area). The nature of the element represented in the middle, described as an altar or another kind of symbol, cannot be as- certained with any confidence either, because only the drawing of the piece has been published: it seems possible that it is the figure of a child, although it is clear from the outset that it cannot be an ' ankh symbol, thus excluding a similar interpretation for the Chagar Bazar mould. 40 The figurine (F. Baffi in Matthiae et al. 1995: 394, no. 241) has been found in the Middle Bronze II large refuse pit F.5861 located north of the Northern Palace (Matthiae 1995: 677-678). An unidentifiable object or spot of metal is present on the left shoulder, although it cannot repre- sent a divine attribute such as a wing or a weapon as is clear from other comparable iconog- raphies.</page><page sequence="14">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 403 2.4. Anatolian moulds of various styles Other moulds representing couples are related stylistically or ico- nographically to the Anatolian groups mentioned above, although they show several different features which do not allow one to propose a pre- cise location for their workshops (a lead couple from Bogazköy, fig. 39, is discussed in the following section although it may also be classified here). A mould of unknown provenance shows a couple with dresses similar to those of the "Alishar" group, as well as the cap of the female figure, while the horned cap of the male figure and the mantle covering his left shoulder may be compared with those of the "elegant" group from Kiiltepe (fig. 31)41. The shape of a mould from Kiiltepe kãrum lb is different in that it has two holes in the upper part for fixing the lid and in that it has an elongated shape; it represents a standing couple on a tall base, a bearded male, with fluted cap holding an axe and a scepter, and a female holding a child (fig. 33)42. Although the elaborate cap of the female figure is similar to that of the "Alishar" group, the dresses of both personages are slightly different from that series and the position of the child, held vertically against the abdomen of the female figure, is not known elsewhere. These two moulds, quite different from one another, must have been carved in central Anatolia, in different workshops from those discussed above or at least at a site not too distant from Alishar or Kiiltepe. From Kiiltepe kãrum lb there also comes a mould iconographically re- lated to the "classic" group from that site (see, e.g., the rampant caprid, the stylization of dresses and the child held in the arms of the female), al- though the style is markedly different, as are some significant details such as the eagle in the upper field (perhaps having a meaning similar to that of the bird standard since the male figure bears no objects) and the curls of the two figures (fig. 32 )43. This may be an example of a mould made lo- cally in a non-specialist workshop, as also the sandstone from which it has been made suggests, since it is the only instance among contemporary Anatolian moulds attesting to the use of this stone (which was instead used for non-professionally made moulds during Middle Bronze I). One mould, finally, shows some peculiarities hinting at contacts with northern Syria, although its marked differences from the iconic pattern of north-Syrian moulds (for which see § 2.6) suggest that it can still be con- 41 Emre 1971: 115, no. 45, fig. 20, pl. V: 2; one can also compare the shirt of the female fig- ure with that of a late Middle Bronze I figurine from Kiiltepe (Emre 1971: pl. V: 1). 42 Emre 1971: 107-108, no. 26, fig. 23, pl.

According to the excava- tor it is unfinished, although some missing details, such as the left curl of the male figure, may simply be due to careless execution.</page><page sequence="15">404 Nicolò Marchetti sidered of Anatolian origin, though its workshop should probably be sought near the southern limit of the region44: this mould, of unknown provenance, represents a bearded personage with a horned cap, holding a caprid-like standard and a scepter and wearing a fringed mantel, and a nude female figure with hands at the breasts (fig. 34), the two latter ico- nographies being typically Old Syrian, although the standard has close similarities with some specimens of the Kültepe "classic" group. 2.5. The group with the "master of animals" subject The pieces discussed here do not specifically belong to any of the above-mentioned series: this group is not stylistically very homogeneous, although it shares a significant iconographie feature in having a single male figure flanked by and holding symmetrically arranged animals, in a pose which can be conventionally called here "master of animals". As far as it is possible to generalize on the basis of limited evidence, it seems that this subject was popular on non-professionally made Middle Bronze I moulds and it is possible that this character was partly maintained also during early Middle Bronze II. With one exception (probably of later date), all the pieces of this group come from Anatolian sites. Two pieces from Kültepe kãrum lb are stylistically related to the "classic" group of that site, although, for example, in the first specimen, a cushion-shaped mould, the fluted cap or the ears of the male figure (hold- ing two caprids against his shoulders, while two lions are joined to his feet) are slightly different from the other pieces of the "classic" group, as is the dress divided by a single line, instead of a double one (fig. 35)45. The other Kültepe figurine (fig. 36) is similar to the preceding one, al- though it has extended arms (the left one holding a curved element, appar- ently a standard or an animal), a feature comparable with two late Middle Bronze I specimens from Alishar (for which see note II)46. Two other fig- urines from the latter site, dating from early Middle Bronze II, are winged and have a dress with a vertical line dividing a herring-bone pattern design (figs. 37-38), as in the two Kültepe figurines mentioned above: one of them has a conical fluted cap, while the other (which seems to have no 44 See Emre 1971: 117, no. 49, pl. VII: 3. 45 T. Ozgíiç 1979: 294-296, fig. 2a-b. Ozgiiç (ibid., p. 295, note 16) points out a probably close comparison, as far as the iconography is concerned, with an unpublished figurine from Ka- rahöyük (for which see Alp 1968: 270; Emre 1971: 106, no. 21, 141). 46 Emre 1993: 173, no. 4, fig. 4, pl. 32: 3.</page><page sequence="16">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 405 arms) has a band on the front surmounted by a bird and another bird with outstretched wings at each side of the body47. Two figurines from Bogazköy are stylistically peculiar48: the first rep- resents a figure with bent open arms with the foreparts of two animals on its shoulders and another two along the lower part of the body (fig. 40), while in the second (which does not specifically belong to this group) there appear two seemingly female figures (figs. F, 39), so identi- fied by the breasts and the patterned designs of their dress, with a quad- ruped in between and two segmented elements along their lower outer sides (snakes according to the editor)49. While in the final publication for Fig. F - Lead figurine, h. 6 cm, from fill, House 13 in square J/20, "Unterstadt" level 1, Bogazköy (Boehmer 1979: pl. 24:3525); scale 1:1. 47 Emre 1971: 103, no. 9, fig. 31, pl. VIII: 4 and p. 103, no. 8, fig. 32, pl. VIII: 3. Both figur- ines seemingly have at their base another pair of wings. 48 Boehmer 1979: 37-38, nos. 3521, 3525, pl. XXIV: 3521, 3525, respectively from levels contemporary with "Unterstadt" 2 and 1 (the second was in fact not precisely stratified, while the former was associated with Bittel 1976: fig. 145, a moulded vessel dating from the 15th-14th centu- ries bc). 49 Both figurines are of uncertain date: the flaring headgears of the two female figures, which in view of their being paired and of their dresses, can be compared with the mould il- lustrated on fig. 28 (and, as far as the dress is concerned, also with fig. 26), are unparalleled, while the schematic rendering of the single male figurine is not attested to in early Middle Bronze II productions and, on the other hand, its dress seems more developed than in late Middle Bronze I figurines. These two pieces may thus represent local production and, if one recalls that the Hattuša kãrum was apparently destroyed earlier than that of Kültepe (see notes 10, 14 and 23 above), some of their peculiarities may be explained by a slightly higher dating (in this per- spective one could also explain the presence in a layer of that date of a mould like Emre 1971: pl. IV: 1, for which see note 12). In any case, one cannot altogether exclude the possibility that</page><page sequence="17">406 Nicolò Marchetti these pieces a dating to the kãrum period (corresponding to "Unterstadt" 4 and Büyükkale IVd) was favoured for these pieces, thought to be resid- ual, one cannot discount the possibility that their peculiarities partly de- pend also on chronological reasons, since they were found in Late Bronze II contexts. A third specimen with typological peculiarities is represented by a lead figurine holding two caprids from Tell Umm el-Marra with a hori- zontally flounced dress and two vertical lions at its base, which must be of non-Anatolian origin because it is twice as large as the usual Cappa- docian figurines (fig. 41)50. The figurine comes from a sounding (SQ) car- ried out by the Belgian Expedition near the rampart where eroded domes- tic remains were found; in the new excavations begun in 1994 on the site, "well-preserved architecture directly below surface with in situ pot- tery of late Middle Bronze II date" (G. Schwartz, personal communi- cation) was found in the area adjoining the SQ sounding and one can thus suppose that the original context of the figurine was of this date. If this assumption is correct, it would be one of the last occurrences of this class and such a low dating would also explain the peculiarity of the fig- urine. 2.6. The "Eblaite" and north-Syrian groups A homogeneous group can be identified from five pieces with nude female figures on them, which are very significant both for their prove- nance and for their iconography and style. A figurine and a mould come respectively from Karahöyük near Konya and, allegedly, from Kültepe: the first one represents a horned female personage with wings, large side curls recalling the hathoric hair-style and extended arms (fig. 42), the two latter features being present also in the other piece, where a female un- veils herself under a winged arch surmounted by a winged sun disk and flanked by two birds (fig. 43)51. The plastic model of the body of the fe- one or both of them represent a late development for the production of lead figurines dating from early Anatolian Late Bronze I (for which see Table 1). 50 Tefnin 1990: 307-308, pl. 103. Although the iconography of this figurine closely re- sembles, in the position of the arms and of the animals, a mould from Kültepe (fig. 35), the short horned cap and the flounced dress (for which compare also fig. 47) are closer to Old Syrian ico- nographies than to Anatolian ones. 51 Karahöyük 1: Alp 1974: 704-705, pls. 225-226 (Emre 1971: 106, no. 19; for the retrieval context, the large pit in Area O, see also Alp 1968: 15-16, fig. 3, pls. 3: 6, 4: 7). Kültepe (?): Emre 1971: 117, no. 51, pl. XI: 4. The position of the arms in the winged figurine possibly recalls the act of unveiling represented in the mould (for which see note 66 below); it is furthermore possible that the two birds on the latter inspired the craftsman of the figurine of the "Alishar" group illustrated on fig. 38. From Karahöyük there also comes an unpublished lead figurine de-</page><page sequence="18">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 407 male figure (which quite uniquely has also a modelled back, indicating that it has been cast in a bivalve mould with both elements carved) is markedly different from other Anatolian figurines and indicates a different origin: the similarity with the figure on the mould (with two holes for fixing the lid, a technique attested to only in two south-Anatolian moulds), for which the winged sun-disk and arch suggest a north-Syrian origin, allows one to suppose that the Karahöyük figurine also comes from the same area. This hypothesis is strengthened through the comparison with a mould and a figurine from Tell Mardikh/Ebla, which seem to belong to a single workshop possibly located at Ebla itself On the mould, three fe- male figures with hands at the breast are depicted, the two outer ones with a bird on the head and the central figure with a crescent-shaped standard surmounted by a star (fig. 45); the lead figurine represents a nude female (on which the navel is indicated), holding with both hands a bird represented in profile (figs. G, 46)52. Another mould with a subject very similar to the Eblaite one (except for the central figure, which is smaller and has a larger standard on its head), allegedly comes from northern Syria and may actually have been made at Ebla itself (fig. 44)53. Fig. G - Lead figurine, h. 4 cm, from room L. 2945 of Western Palace Q, Tell Mardikh (TM.00.Q.30); scale 1:1. scribed as representing a sphinx with a lion on the back (Alp 1968: 15; Emre 1971: 106, no. 20, p. 150, note 267). 52 The steatite mould (TM.66.E.144; Fronzaroli 1967: 92-93, pl. LXVI.1-2; Matthiae 1989a: 205, pl. 158) comes from room L.154 of the Middle Bronze II Palace E on the acropolis, while the lead figurine (TM.00.Q.30) comes from the doorway between rooms L.2945 and L.2950 of Western Palace Q (for which see Matthiae 1989a: fig. 37; although the palace was founded dur- ing Middle Bronze I, most of its materials are of Middle Bronze II date, ibid., p. 164). The mea- surements of the latter piece, of which only the upper half is preserved, are h. 4, w. 2.2, th. 0.5 cm. 53 Muscarella 1981: 238-240, no. 208.</page><page sequence="19">408 Nicolò Marchetti 2.7. The northern Mesopotamian workshops A mould from Nineveh shows a couple with long flounced dresses similar to those of Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian divine figures (flg. 47)54. In addition to its iconography and to its provenance, its plastic style also indicates a northern Mesopotamian origin, although some ele- ments indicate that the workshop in which it was made must have been in close contact with the others, having been perhaps located just south of the easternmost Taurus range, if not at Nineveh itself55. Of more markedly Mesopotamian style is a fragmentary lead figurine from Khafajah Mound B/Dur-Samsuiluna, representing a suppliant goddess (flg. 48)56. Although different workshops were responsible for these two pieces, they must have been located in northern Mesopotamia, representing the southeasternmost area of diffusion for this peculiar class. 3. The significance of Middle Bronze Age metal figurines In order to set the production of Syro-Anatolian lead figurines more satisfactorily in a historical perspective, it seems necessary to compare it with contemporary production of metal figurines and other forms of vis- ual art. At the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, a new production of cast metal figurines is attested to in the Levant, which is characteristic of the Old Syrian culture and which does not show significant Egyptian- izing iconographie features until the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, although a few traits are attested to since the second half of the Middle Bronze Age. Existing works on the subject provide a sound basis for its discussion, although the precise chronology of these figurines (the great- est majority of which coming from illegal excavations) remains to be es- tablished. The earliest groups, dating from Middle Bronze IA, are those 54 Emre 1971: 114-115, no. 44, pl. XI: 2 (the provenance as from Nineveh, unknown in previ- ous publications, is registered under the inventory number 92666 in the British Museum archives, whereas it is not clear if the mound itself of Kuyunjik is meant). The incised cap of the male fig- ure may perhaps be inspired by the divine headgears with frontal multiple horns of Meso- potamian iconography. 55 The flaring beard follows Anatolian models; furthermore, the ears, though much smaller, have the same shape as in the Kültepe groups. The dressed female (in which however the navel is represented!) holding her breasts is also an Anatolian trait, as is the alternating hatching on the male's dress. 56 Hill et al. 1990: 231, pl. 63a (the precise retrieval context of the figurine is unknown, al- though excavated levels in the area date from the early Old Babylonian period). The figurine shows clear ties with southern Mesopotamian bronze figures (see, e.g., Braun-Holzinger 1984: pl. 35).</page><page sequence="20">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 409 from Jezzin and Tell Judaidah in the northern Levant57. It seems likely that Seeden's north-Syrian group immediately follows, being partly con- temporary with the production at Byblos, which mainly spans Middle Bronze IB and IIA. Couples represent a popular theme since the very be- ginning of this production, although their significance remains problem- atic at this early date, while divinized royal ancestors (of a noteworthy plasticity and recognizable by their costume) are attested to since Middle Bronze IIA-B58. Among contemporary Old Syrian clay figurines, nude females and sitting males simply hint at the divine realm through the representation of the goddess' votaries and of royal (probably ancestral) personages respec- tively. Standing nude male figurines, instead, seem to represent a semi- divine hero with six curls. Comparisons with other classes of visual evi- dence confirm this interpretation, which does not exclude the possibility of multiple levels of meaning but basically sees the divine world suggest- ed rather than represented in this class, although a shift towards the latter significance is accomplished by the beginning of the Late Bronze Age59. The favourite subject of Middle Bronze Age Syro- Anatolian lead fig- urines is a couple, rather than a single nude female as in the earlier tradition from the end of the third millennium be. In many cases, figurines have di- vine attributes, either horns or wings, and thus they certainly represent de- ities60. The nude females of the north-Syrian group, however, may be linked with the range of meanings associated with similar representations in Old Syrian figurines, either in metal or in clay, as sketched above: their nudity and the fact that they hold or are surmounted by birds (possibly doves) suggest that they are connected with the goddess Ištar, although they do not directly represent her but rather a lesser divine figure or even hierodules serving the goddess61. 57 See Marchetti 2000a for discussion and dating of these pieces. 58 Seeden 1980: 15-91, pls. 10-93; see also Negbi 1976: pls. 1-4, 6-9, 14-16, 35, 49, 56-60. For some comments on the chronology of the Byblos deposits see also Marchetti - Nigro 1997: 34-35, notes 97-106. 59 Marchetti 2001: 322-334, pls. CCCVI-CCCVIII. 60 As for the Kültepe kãrum lb "classic" group, the god next to a rampant capnd has been identified with the god Amurru (Emre 1971: 140-141), on the iconography of which see Braun- Holzinger 1996: 287-301, nos. 219-484, pls. 27-30. However, the god is never part of a couple in Old Babylonian glyptic and the caprid may not always be present, although it is his standard ani- mal (see ibid., p. 260). Methodologically speaking, one must note the risks of such identifica- tions in cultural environments different from that of the epigraphic sources (in fact, Emre 1971: 156 stresses the difficulty of precise identifications). For some comments on the Anatolian cou- ples see also Mayer-Opificius 1978: 597, fig. 4; N. Ôzgiiç 1979. 61 A detailed analysis of the visual contexts where the "naked goddess" appears, is a most necessary task, but lies outside the scope of this paper (for some comments see Marchetti 2001 : 328-329; Marchetti - Nigro 1997: 22, 31-32). Orientalia - 36</page><page sequence="21">410 Nicolò Marchetti The great majority of Levantine bronze figurines does not present clear divine attributes and, in some of the most naturalistic specimens, figurines wear a royal dress and tiara62. While these figurines evidently represent divinized royal ancestors, it remains possible that the divinized roy- al couple also hints at the divine couple giving wealth to the land, repre- sented by the Weather-God and the Fertility Goddess63. Old Syrian choroplastic seems to have had a partly similar meaning, with the iconog- raphy of male figurines echoing in several cases that of royal statuary64. Anatolian lead plaques with two main figures, male and female, can be compared with Levantine couples in bronze, while the iconography with two adults and a child is seemingly paralleled by Syrian Middle Bronze IB groups, where an armed male figure is associated in the same piece with other smaller figures65. Some Old Syrian echoes are found in the "Alishar" group: the nude female with hands at the breast of fig. 25 recalls (in addition to the earlier type on the moulds for jewels and the Middle Bronze I figurines from Acemhöyük and Kültepe) the "Eblaite" group, while the figurine with the characteristic robe of this group but open on one side (fig. 24), probably hints at the well known iconography in Old Syrian glyptic of the unveiling goddess66. Thus, couples are attested to among Levantine and Anatolian metal figurines since the very beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, although among the former we are first dealing with free-standing specimens and only later with cast groups ("Orontes" group). Northern Syria exhibits a more complex patterning of the symbolic evidence than does Anatolia, where divine figures seem largely to prevail within the iconographie reper- toire attested to on the stone moulds for lead figurines67. 62 On the dress see Mazzoni 1979 and Matthiae 2000: 212. 63 For the detailed setting of the Old Syrian cult of royal ancestors, see Matthiae 1990; for a hypothesis concerning the various levels of meaning connected with such representations see Marchetti 2000a: 131-132. Bronze figurines, though cast as single pieces, were often conceived in pairs, the female figurine (in most cases nude and with hands at the breast) being probably a symbolic figure connected with the cult of the Great Goddess (see ibid., pp. 121-126, figs. 2-3, pl. Ia; see also note 58 above). The seated bronze figurine found near Bogazköy may, on stylistic grounds, represent a Syrian import (Negbi 1976: 52, 173, no. 1467, pl. 36; for a different opinion see Matthiae 2000: 231-232). 64 See Marchetti 2000b: 850; id. 2001: 329-330, pls. CCCVII-CCCVIII. For standing male figures see however ibid., pp. 330-331. 65 Seeden 1980: 15-17, pls. 10-11. 66 Otto 2000c: 202-204, § 14.1.1.1 and pp. 209-211, 66 14.1.1.5.2-6. 67 Moorey - Fleming 1984: 77-78 have already noted that the identification of bronze fig- urines with divine subjects cannot be taken for granted.</page><page sequence="22">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 411 4. The workshops for lead figurines and their moulds during the Middle Bronze Age in the Syro-Anatolian area Lead figurines and their moulds appeared and developed during re- spectively the mature and late phases of Early Bronze Age urbanization, probably in the area between southeastern Anatolia and northern Meso- potamia: the earliest attestation comes from Titris Höyük on the Upper Eu- phrates, while slightly later they are found at Tell Brak/Nagar and Qal'at Shergat/Aššur, reaching western Anatolia (Akhisar and Hisarlik/Troy) and central Mesopotamia (Abu Habbah/Sippar) probably through trade. The characteristic series of Middle Bronze Age moulds for figurines (on which jewels are however no more attested to) seems to have devel- oped from this early group, of which in fact the scale and materials (stea- tite or serpentine) were kept. During Middle Bronze I, the documentation, not abundant, is limited to southeastern Anatolia: while the schematic pro- duction represents a local feature which does not continue as such and which is mainly interesting here for attesting to a few motifs known also in the following period68, more naturalistic specimens represent the tradi- tion from which stem the main types of the following period. Early Middle Bronze II marks the apogee in the production of lead fig- urines and their moulds. Their distribution and style allow one to identify several workshops and to note, accordingly, some trade patterns (fig. A). More than three-quarters of known pieces can be ascribed to Anatolian workshops and this suffices to show that, at this epoch, northern Meso- potamia was no more a significant area of production for this class (as was probably the case as early as the beginning of Middle Bronze I). The sim- ple manufacturing technique of this class of artifacts evidently further fa- cilitated their diffusion69, as attested to also by the circulation of moulds, which reveals the appreciation of their imagery and meaning by different, local tastes. In fact, the identification of an "Eblaite" workshop and of oth- ers in northern Syria and Mesopotamia suggests the existence of a more complex pattern, with a plurality of workshops elaborating, with distinctive styles, motifs which belonged to a similar symbolic repertoire. A signif- icant circulation of finished products is revealed by the spatial distribution 68 The motif of the master of animals is still attested to during early Middle Bronze II (figs. 35-38), as is the checkered platform, of which at least one specimen, though it is rather cross- hatched, is known from this latter period (fig. 13). 69 One mould of the "elegant" group (fig. 13) was found at Kíiltepe kãrum lb together with a "blow-pipe and a lead ingot" (Emre 1971: 161, pl. XV: la-b, 2), thus documenting the final pro- duction process. It seems likely that the Judaidah figurine (fig. 8) was cast in Syria from an im- ported mould, as can be inferred by the retrieval of the mould from Knaye (fig. 2).</page><page sequence="23">412 Nicolò Marchetti of the forty pieces, whose provenance is known. The "classic" and "ele- gant" groups, manufactured at Kiiltepe, have been found north of the Kizi- lirmak (at Alishar Hüyük and Bogazköy) and in the lower Orontes valley (at Knaye and Tell Judaidah and at Zincirli) and perhaps as far as (west- ern?) Iran. This pattern is fully consistent with the scope of trading pat- terns attested for the site: imports from northern Syria are represented at Kiiltepe kãrum lb by metal objects, pottery and seals70. Quite differently, the Alishar group is attested to at Kiiltepe kãrum lb and Acemhöyiik, i.e. only within central Anatolia, as also can be observed for the miscellanous groups including the pieces with the "master of animals" subject. The south-eastern Anatolian group, if it can be considered the product of a sin- gle workshop, is similarly distributed, although it is more shifted towards northern Mesopotamia, being attested to, in addition to Ebla, at Tell Cha- gar Bazar and Tell al-Rimah. The likely existence of a north-Syrian work- shop located at Tell Mardikh shows the northern-oriented trading relations of that site at the time, some of ist products being attested to at Karahöyük and possibly also at Kiiltepe. On the contrary, the northern Mesopotamian group offers very limited evidence. In conclusion, Anatolian figurines from Middle Bronze I are schemat- ic, while they become more naturalistic during Kiiltepe kãrum lb times, a period when, as it has been attempted to show here, several workshops are active on the Anatolian plateau and the northern Syrian plains within a thriving commercial network. While metal figurines remain popular parti- cularly in the coastal Levant, lead figurines and their moulds (which, as has been shown, were also traded) cease to be a major class of production with the end of the age of the "balance of power"71. The latter series of events, which sees central Anatolia plunging into a far-reaching crisis from which eventually the Hittite Old Kingdom emerges, results in the establish- ment of regional powers in southern Mesopotamia and northern Syria and a reshaping of the trading patterns: this process is accompanied by a sharp decline in the workshops producing Syro-Anatolian lead figurines and their moulds, some of which, however, continue to be active for some time, as suggested possibly by the evidence from Bogazköy "Unterstadt" levels 2-1 and Tell Umm el-Marra. 700zgûç 1986b: 204. See also Matthiae 1989b for discussion of the distribution of the so- called Syro-Cilician ware. 71 See Otto 2000b for a definition of this perspective in relation to visual media. The distri- bution of glyptic styles highlights the cultural continuum and flourishing trade attested to, during this brief period, from northern Syria to central Anatolia and to Assyria, which shows a signif- icant increase in respect of kãrum II times (Ôzgiiç 1968; Otto 2000a); Marchetti 2003 discusses in some detail the glyptic relationships of these areas between late Middle Bronze I and early Middle Bronze II.</page><page sequence="24">Workshops, Trading Routes and Divine Figures 413 References Algaze, G.
