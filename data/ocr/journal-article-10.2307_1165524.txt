It is also the second monograph prepared by Dr. Farber on the sociological factors of the effects of a retarded child on family integration, the first monograph having been published as Serial No. 71 of the Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1959- In this monograph Dr. Farber has utilized the von Neumann and Morgenstern theory of games of strategy by applying this conceptual model as an analogue to the family in a crisis situation as being involved in a game of strategy against nature. This conceptual model has allowed an analysis of the data from individual interviews of 233 families of severely retarded children. In this study Professor Farber shows that broad generalizations applying to all families of severely retarded cannot be made. Even the question of whether placing the retarded child in an institution will assist the integra- tion of the family cannot be answered by a simple affirmative or negative response. There are many dimensions that must be considered. One such dimension pertains to the kind of orientation of the family, such as the parent-oriented family, the home-oriented family, or the child-oriented family. A second dimension isolated by Dr. Farber concerns the strategies of nature, over which the family has little control. These include the sex and birth order of the retarded child, premarital and early marital situation of the parents, religion, and social class. By isolating the family orientation and the variables imposed by nature, Dr. Farber has been able to evolve some guides to counselors of families of severely retarded children. This investigation was supported by a grant from the Mental Health Fund of the Illinois Department of Public Welfare. SAMUEL A.

A family crisis can be defined as the breakdown of patterns of conduct and values which had been developed to guide activities of family members through the family's life-cycle. The crisis can be either limited or general in its severity. For example, having a first child in any family disrupts previous family routines and modifies the values of the parents (20). The parents, however, can usually maintain most of their occupational, friend- ship, and kinship commitments. In contrast, having a severely mentally retarded child frequently creates a situation of utter chaos. In interviews, parents of severely mentally retarded children have remarked: I had the feeling that everything in the world had ended and stopped for me. Nothing worse could happen. It would be better if the whole family could be wiped out. I used to dream that it wasn't real and didn't happen. They explained to me that he would never be normal mentally. It was a complete trauma and shock to both of us-the horror was equal. I got hysterical. It's something you just don't get over, but I am feeling a lot better in many ways. If you have dreamed all your life of having a child and watching him grow up and go through life and then have it smashed all at once, it's pretty rough on you. It's crushing. Although the emotional impact of having a severely retarded child is generally great, the parents do meet the challenge which the retarded child presents. They do not stop living. Family roles and values are revised. Decisions are made to handle successive problems that arise. Several questions can be asked with respect to the ability of the family to withstand the disruptive influence of the retarded child: I. What are the conditions or circumstances which influence the poten- tial severity of the disintegrative effects of the retarded child on the family? 2. What are the effective courses of action which the family may take in order to maintain its integrity? 3. As specific courses of action, (a) Is it necessary to place the retarded child in an institution? (b) How does interaction between normal and re- tarded siblings affect the normal children? To suggest answers to these questions, a study was undertaken of effects on family integration of the presence of a severely mentally retarded child. 5</page><page sequence="5">6 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS The results reported in this monograph pertain to 233 families living in the Chicago metropolitan area. The data in the study were analyzed in two phases. The first phase of the analysis was concerned primarily with conditions which influenced the effect of the severely retarded child on family integration. Findings of the first phase of analysis were reported in an earlier monograph (Io). The present monograph is based on the results of the second phase of analysis, which dealt with courses of action developed by the family to maintain its integrity. To make explicit the assumptions underlying the second phase of analy- sis and to provide a framework for integrating specific hypotheses, a research model was developed. This model was based upon the theory of games as described by economists (24). The discussion below, however, pertains only to the model as used in the present study. In the model the activities of husband and wife in a crisis situation are considered as analogous to their acting in concert as a player in a game of strategy. As a research instrument, the model specifies the relationship between the investigator and his subject matter. While the subjects of the research are considered as participants in a game of strategy, the investigator is re- garded as the judge who (a) defines the rules of the game insofar as his conceptual scheme and instruments permit him and (b) evaluates the out- come. Over a period of time, the judge or investigator can approach a theory of games of strategy only as his knowledge of all the pertinent moves of the players becomes perfect. Any game consists of a set of admissible moves which, combined in certain ways, result in a resolution of a contest. A move is defined as a single alternative in the set of acts specified in the rules of the game. In playing the game, the participants choose a number of these moves (either at the same time or in sequence) to resolve the contest. A strategy is re- garded as a specific combination of moves. The problems of the judge or investigator are (a) to gain a perfect knowledge of all effective moves and strategies possible in the game and (b) to obtain full information regarding the development of strategies by the players. The judge's ability to perform these tasks is limited by the present state of research technology and organization of theoretical con- cepts. In doing research, the judge's task is then to expand upon both research technology and theoretical constructs. GAMES OF STRATEGY AND THE PREDICTION OF FAMILY BEHAVIOR Decision-making, whether in economic institutions or government, seems to imply a problematic situation or critical event (cf. 26). The family crisis presents a situation which requires solution, and any stage in the family cycle produces its own set of crises. Several severe crises in</page><page sequence="6">THE RESEARCH MODEL 7 the family have been investigated (e.g., unemployment, mental illness, alcoholism:.and the presence of a severely mentally retarded child). In each of these crises the decisions made determined the eventual integration or disintegration of the family. Thus, the problem of prediction of subsequent events is introduced. Since the games of strategy analogy is so closely allied with prediction problems, it seems reasonable to view the application of the games analogy to family crises within the framework of a prediction re- search model. The analogy in the discussion below is based upon a two-person zero- sum game in the theory of games of strategy. A zero-sum game means merely that the amount lost by one player is gained by the other (I, pp. 144-146). In the following sections a general statement is made concerning the players, the rules of the game, and conditions for playing the game. The Players Generally, the game model permits the methodological opposition of factors which are controllable by the marital partners and those which are uncontrollable. For example, demographic and community factors are beyond the control of individual families and certain of these factors can be assumed to "play against" the marriage. The married couple must counteract the effects of these attributes, and certain parts of their interaction operate to overcome the unfavorableness of the demographic and community attributes. Resorting to anthropomorphism in order to create a "methodological" adversary in a strategy model has been found a useful fiction. For example, Toynbee's concept of challenge-and-response implies an environment, either human or physical, with evil motives, attempting to prevent self-determina- tion and growth (29, p. 199). In addition, the family in crisis itself often regards Nature as an antagonist. Parents of severely mentally retarded children have described their problem as follows: It was an act of God. Raymond is like a small pair in poker-too good to throw in-hoping it will improve-while throwing money in. I was stunned that it was my boy that this had happened to-you know it can always happen to someone else's kid and you say, "My, that's a shame." I wasn't ashamed or bitter-I was more disappointed-I wanted him to be normal and be able to play ball and stuff like that. People told me that if I got pregnant, the next one would be the same [retarded]. Then when I got pregnant, I was afraid; but my husband told me not to be afraid-just take that chance. There was complete amazement-that isn't the right word-from self- pity-why did this have to happen to us, wondering about ourselves and each other-whether there's something wrong with us. Nothing like this ever happened before in either of our families.</page><page sequence="7">8 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS Aside from providing a stimulus for action, the anthropomorphic fiction provides a framework for evaluating whether or not the action of Nature is favorable or unfavorable for the development of the group. The valuational framework facilitates the grouping of various kinds of situations. Without the grouping, we would have to resort to a descriptive classification of situations. This would mean eliminating many details and significant combinations of circumstances from the descriptions in order to maintain homogenous groupings. With Nature as a challenger in a game, however, the many combinations of circumstances which may go into defining "un- favorableness" can be grouped, and the married couple's responses to various degrees of "unfavorableness" can be studied. In the application of the theory of games to economics, the assumption of rational behavior is made. By rational behavior is meant the logical deduction by the actor of the amount of pay-off accruing from given delib- erate conduct. To require "rational behavior" (as defined above) in counter- acting family crises implies that the strategies which enable the family to meet crises without loss of mutual commitment of family members or decrease in personal integrity are conscious and voluntary. Earlier studies of the reaction of families to crises have shown, however, that the ability to overcome crisis is influenced by the pre-crisis family organization. Emo- tional elements achieve importance in meeting crisis. Thus, the extent to which the actor is deliberate in his development of strategies is not pertinent to the efficacy of a given strategy. The strategy itself is the unit of study. The normative object of the research is to enable families in a crisis to make a rational choice between strategies. Rules of the Game The rules of the game of strategy include an enumeration of the strat- egies and moves permitted in the game and a description of the system of pay-offs. A full description of the rules of the game would provide a theoretical basis for describing given strategies and circumstances "favorable" or "unfavorable" to marital integration. Moves and strategies. Moves and strategies (including circumstances) can be classified in three ways: (a) the amount of their value or utility, (b) whether or not the moves are permitted in the game under study, and (c) conditions affecting the value of the moves. In the application of the theory of games in economics, the concept of strategy involves a plan of specific moves to be made in every possible situa- tion (24, p. 79). The "value" of each strategy is the amount of pay-off units obtained through the application of that strategy. With the assump- tion of rational behavior, minimum and maximum pay-off accruing from the strategy can be foreseen by the player. The player can then make choices which would maximize his gains with the least amount of risk. If, however, the assumption of rationality in the development of strategies is dropped,</page><page sequence="8">THE RESEARCH MODEL 9 then the basis for defining the player's strategies must be derived by the investigator from theoretical consideration or results of past research. In prediction, the background or crisis circumstances-the factors over which the individual or group now has no control-can be regarded as the moves of his opponent (Nature) in the game. That is, the individual's or group's crisis circumstances challenge him (or the group) by acting to maximize the social costs in a marriage (i.e., trying to bring about personal disorganization, unhappiness, divorce, or at least heightened conflict). It is assumed that some combinations of background factors or crisis circum- stances are more efficient in increasing social costs than are others. In only a few cases are all crisis circumstances favorable or unfavorable. Usually, both favorable and unfavorable factors are present. The degree of unfavor- ableness of the combination of circumstances determines the "value" or "utility" of that set of crisis circumstances for the game. In order to minimize the probability of personal disorganization, unhap- piness, conflict, or divorce, the individuals must make certain choices from a set of alternative moves. Making choices which minimize social costs would therefore be more urgent under a very severe challenge of circum- stance than under a less severe challenge. One task of prediction research on the family can be to determine the rank-order of the effectiveness of strategies used by married coupes to counteract unfavorable circumstances. The purpose of the first sample studied is to determine pay-off matrices for various strategies. Succeeding samples are then needed to verify these pay-off matrices. Regardless of their value or utility, only certain moves are considered legitimate in the rules of the game. In the theory of games the game with an infinite number of possible strategies is included (21, pp. 141-149). Given the limits of research method or technique, however, it seems ex- pedient to restrict the game under study to a small number of strategies and place all other choices by subjects and their circumstances into a residual category. In the game analogy players' moves not enumerated in the rules as defined by the judge are regarded as "cheating"; e.g., making chess moves in a game of checkers. Pay-offs in games are made only in accordance with legitimate moves. In research the investigator has no power to disallow a marriage inte- gration score because a strategy was applied which was not included in the rules of the game as he had defined them. "Cheating" in the context of the game analogy in research is defined from the judge's, not the player's, point of view. From a legal or moral perspective the conduct regarded as "cheating" may be highly acceptable. The investigator must either ignore the "cheating" or revise his rules to legitimate the strategy in question. For example, in a sample of parents with retarded children a married couple using strategies which generally are favorable to marital integration</page><page sequence="9">10 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS among couples with a similar background received a low marital integration score. Further investigation of the case, however, revealed that the husband also showed many indications of paranoia. The child had been conceived to prevent the wife from "running around." The husband was actually pleased that the child was almost completely dependent and kept his wife fully occupied. The case served to emphasize that the prediction instrument was valid only for nonpsychotic persons. In bringing what seemed like paranoia to the marriage, the husband introduced a move to the game that was not included in the prediction instrument. By examining deviant cases, the investigator is sensitized to discern ways of "cheating" by the couples studied. If the same kind of "cheating" takes place in many instances, the investigator can change the rules to legitimate these moves in future use of the prediction instrument. In changing the rules of his game, the investigator must revise his conceptual scheme to include the newly legitimated strategies or circumstances (cf. 22, pp. 98-ori). Hence, with the game analogy, items cannot be added to the prediction battery arbitrarily. The new items, regarded as strategies, must also be integrated into the admissable rules of the game. Because of the great complexity surrounding the lives of most people, however, it would be impossible to legitimize all "cheating" with respect to the rules of the prediction instrument. Arbitrarily, in the evaluation of strategies already hypothecated, it is assumed that "cheating" occurs in an idiosyncratic manner in each family and that the effect of this "cheating" on marital integration score is randomly distributed throughout the popula- tion. If the scores on marital integration for a sample of families are re- stricted to a given range and the distribution of scores tends toward a normal curve, any effects of "cheating" would operate as a regression toward the mean integration score. Hence, the mean integration score for subcategories of circumstances and strategies would be used to evaluate predictions made (along with appropriate tests of statistical significance) on the basis of certain specified strategies. Regarding "cheating" as idiosyncratic unfortunately eliminates (in prac- tice) the saddle-point or minimax solution in evaluating a "legitimate" strategy. The saddle-point indicates the choice which will permit a maxi- mum gain at a minimum possible cost and assumes a specific value in terms of the pay-off for each strategy. However, if the opposing player can "cheat" in his move, we can never be certain of our minimum possible cost. Since' "cheating" is not a predictable move in playing the game, we cannot make a choice with the expectation of being "cheated." Hence, in evaltating predictions, we act as if only strategies within the rules of the game will be used. Only in the ideal case where there is no "cheating" can we expect to obtain the exact marital integration for couples faced with critical char- acteristics of a certain severity. Actually, because of "cheating" by the families, strategies can have only mean "value" or utility.</page><page sequence="10">THE RESEARCH MODEL 11 Strategies can be classified not only in terms of their values and legiti- macy but also in terms of conditions affecting their consequences for pay- offs. Some strategies may be capable of overcoming any kind of opposition; other strategies may be restricted in their usefulness to given situations. In the absence of a saddle-point solution, this classification may be important. A general strategy would tend to be effective regardless of the circumstances under which it was used. A specialized strategy would tend to be effective only under given combinations of circumstances. For example, placing the retarded child in an institution may serve to increase the marital integration of parents faced with unfavorable circumstances regarding the sex of the retarded child, social class, religion, and birth order of the retarded child. However, if a family with favorable circumstances surrounding the retarded child placed that child in an institution, the marital integration of the parents may actually decrease. Hence, strategies can be ranked in order of the generality of their appropriateness. System of pay-of. The marital integration score as the commodity to be maximized in family crises constitutes the major pay-off in the game. The securing of marital integration scores, which are obtained in the course of the research, does not terminate the game. The scores merely define the status of the game; the rules of marriage provide that the game can only be stopped by legal proceedings, desertion, or by the death of one spouse at any time. Marital integration is defined as (a) the consensus of husband and wife on their ranking of domestic values and (b) the effective coordination of domestic roles. Failure to coordinate domestic roles is defined negatively as tension in the system of roles. The definition of marital integration, furthermore, assumes that in the integrated marriage (a) there is a clear- cut focus or coherence of the domestic values on a single aspect of family life-the development of the children, the welfare of the parents, or the promotion of the home and (b) the specific moves are so organized as to direct the interaction of family members consistently toward gratification of this aspect of family life. The specific organization of the moves into integrative family orientations represents the development of strategies which are considered as consistent in attaining gratification for the parents in a given, focused aspect of family life. Hence, the integrative family orientations reflect a utility for the parents. This utility, from the perspective of the pay-off in a game of strategy, is objectified in the index of marital integration. Although marital integration is regarded as the major pay-off, there are other consequences resulting from the reaction of the family to crises. In fact, one of the problems in prediction is that of multiplicity of conse- quences of circumstances and strategies. While a given kind of strategy may tend to result in high marital integration, it may also produce per- sonality problems in children.</page><page sequence="11">12 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS One solution to the problem of multiple criteria of family success is to apply an average weight to each criterion (e.g., personal adjustment, happiness, sex adjustment, extent of love, and emotional interdependence) on the basis of a factor analysis or a canonical correlation (19; 5, P. 554). The weighting is performed on an empirical basis. With the introduction of the analogy of the game of strategy, an alter- native procedure for handling secondary criteria of success becomes avail- able. In games of strategy the participants can make "side bets" in terms of highly restricted rules. For example, in chess or checkers the players may bet not only on who will win but also on whether the person may win within a certain number of moves or whether certain pieces will be "taken." There can be several side bets during the course of a single game. A player can win many of the side bets, but lose the game. In the study of families in crisis situations, if the pay-off for the game is the degree of marital integration, the pay-off in side bets can be such criteria as the extent of adjustment of the children, the involvement between parents and grandparents, the fertility of the parents, or the place of the family in the community. The rules of the game would be formulated on -the basis of the pay-off of the primary criterion of success, but side bets (or secondary criteria) could be introduced at any point in the game. The decision as to whether a given criterion is primary or secondary would have to be made on the basis of either theoretical or practical considerations, but not on the empirical grounds of degree of predictability (19). Because of the close relationship between specific parts of the games and side bets, the secondary criteria would be evaluated only for specific moves considered pertinent to them. For example, in the study of families with mentally retarded children, the use of normal siblings as parent surrogates in caring for the retarded child could be evaluated not only as it affected the marital integration of the parents but also as it influenced the personality development of the normal children involved. Conditions for Playing the Game From a theoretical viewpoint the games-of-strategy model presented seems to supplement the dramaturgical analogy of social relations (cf. 6; 15). The dramaturgical analogy- vividly describes the situation of well-defined expectations in which, so to speak, the *"script" (mutual understanding) carefully defines each person's role. The dramaturgical analogy fails as soon as someone "gives the show away" or another unanticipated event occurs which is not accounted for in the "script." At that point, the number of alternatives increase and decisions must be made; new strategies must be devised; a new tentative "script" must be introduced. These alternatives, however, are not infinite in number. It is impossible for an actor to be guided in every muscular movement by the script so that he is completely restricted to a single set of acts by the script. Similarly, it</page><page sequence="12">THE RESEARCH MODEL 13 would be .impossible to choose alternative innovations if there were an infinite number of potential strategies and no rules for their selection. Probably, social relations can be placed on a continuum with the dramatic or completely restricted kind of social relations at one extreme and strategic or infinite kinds of social relations at the other. Specific social relations can then be described as tending toward the dramatic or the strategic. In some instances, the dramatic analogy would serve as a more appropriate model and, in other instances, the games of strategy analogy seems a more appropriate model. Generally, we may assume that each family is motivated to solve its strategic problems and to act out its own plot. The normal plot in family life is ordinarily described as its life-cycle. Family life as a game of strategy is therefore descriptive of the process by which the family members define or "write the script for" the family life-cycle when a disturbance in the original or normal script occurs. AN EVALUATION OF THE GAMES OF STRATEGY ANALOGY In stating that the family in crisis acts like a participant in a game of strategy, we imply merely that by superimposing the assumptions and attributes of the game of strategy upon the family situation we can make a variety of interrelated predictions about family relations. The usefulness of the game model lies in its predictive power rather than in its reflection of the "reality" or "essence" of the family in crisis. Hence, problems such as whether the family conceives of itself as playing a game against Nature are not pertinent to the adequacy of the model. Only the ability of the game analogy applied to the family in crisis to explain variation in family rela- tions is the criterion of adequacy. It is anticipated that one of the gains in prediction research procedure to be made through using the games of strategy analogy is a narrowing of the gap between theoretical formulations of marital interaction and the development of prediction devices. The increased reliance on theory is accomplished through the need for making explicit a description of the players and the rules of the game. Hence, in describing the players and the rules, we discuss assumptions about the personal attributes of the players and the nature of interaction. The games-of-strategy model in the study of family crisis makes explicit the following assumptions: i. The motivation of individuals is to maximize the probability of their attaining certain values or goals at a minimum of risk of social costs. 2. In the face of uncertainty the family members are motivated to get together to define a "script" pertaining to the attainment of their ideal family cycle. The general hypothesis is that an internally consistent pattern</page><page sequence="13">14 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS of relationships focused on a given aspect of family life must be developed to maintain family integrity. 3. Critical situations and critical circumstances can be ranked as to the severity of their impact upon the family in its life-cycle development. The ranking of strategies by their severity provides a framework for the development of specific hypotheses (cf. 7). The model sensitizes the investigator to determine (a) whether there exists a general desired "script" as defined in the community, (b) the severity of a given crisis as it affects the family's actual "script," (c) the strategies which the family members develop to counteract the crisis, and (d) the effectiveness of various strategies in counteracting a crisis of a given severity. 4. Various attributes can be regarded as clustered or cumulative in the form of strategies. This assumption facilitates the handling of a large number of variables in specific combinations rather than by average weights. Thus, the procedure enables prediction by combination of attributes rather than "prediction score" and increases the power of explanation of predic- tion instruments. 5. In prediction research the aim of the investigator is to select or develop a procedure which (a) provides the least amount of error in pre- diction for the population as a whole and (b) minimizes social costs. That is, first, the investigator must find a means which, in marriage, maximizes the proportion of the total variance of marital success scores explained by the predictors (18, p. 258ff.); secondly, he must find a prediction instru- ment which specifies decisions which will produce the highest amount of social utility (and, at the same time, the least social cost) (i6). The games of strategy analogy takes into account both error in prediction and concepts of social cost and utility. 6. Research related to prediction is an iterative process. (The model makes a provision for reducing "cheating" by families in crisis by its rule that strategies previously regarded as idiosyncratic can be legitimated. By this rule of serendipity, the predictive power of the research instrument can be increased without revising the general model itself.) 7. By its provisions for major pay-offs and side bets, the model permits analysis in terms of specific combinations of scores pertaining to criteria of success in meeting crises. The game analogy also seems appropriate for a variety of practical situations. For example, the application of the results of a study may require a coalition between the family members and a therapist. The game in the research would then become more than a two-person game. The situation covered by the model employed, however, includes not only the evaluation of alternatives which the family can apply, but also the process by which this family tries to apply the strategy as a second game. A problem which may arise in a counseling situation is that the success of previous, tested strategies may exert a conservative influence. That- is,</page><page sequence="14">THE RESEARCH MODEL 15 instead of being encouraged to keep exploring for new integrative strategies, the family would be encouraged to use a strategy already devised. The decision, which itself can be handled within the framework of the theory of games of strategy, however, is one for the family and its therapist to make. FAMILY REACTION TO A MENTALLY RETARDED CHILD AS A GAME OF STRATEGY In the study described in this monograph, an assumption was made that the presence of a severely mentally retarded child tends to induce an arrest in the family life-cycle. Furthermore, this arrest in the family cycle tends to inhibit the marital integration of the parents. An earlier analysis of the data supported this contention. It was found that the sex of the child, the social status of the parents, the religion of the parents, and the personal adjustment of the parents prior to the' birth of the child influ- enced the extent to which the retarded child affected the marital integration of his parents. According to results of other studies, these factors affected the parents' expectations of the patterns in which their child's life career would develop. Those items which reflected a greater emphasis on the child's achieve- ment also indicated lower marital integration for the parents. Hence, certain combinations of the items concerning sex of the child, social status, religion, and early personal adjustment of the parents seemed more unfavorable to the marital integration of the parents than did other combinations. These combinations or strategies could then be classified as to their utility (i.e., whether these circumstances were favorable or unfavorable for the couples' marital integration scores). The remainder of the monograph will be concerned with an enumera- tion of the rules of the specific "game" under study and an evaluation of the adequacy of hypothecated strategies. After a discussion of research procedures, the moves of Nature will be investigated. Then, family strategies will be described and evaluated. Fol- lowing this, deviant cases will be examined to uncover patterns among idiosyncratic (or "cheating") moves and strategies developed for main- taining family integration. Finally, the effects of interaction between normal and retarded siblings upon the normal sibling's family relationships will be described as a secondary criterion or "side bet."</page><page sequence="15">PROCEDURES In this section will be described (a) characteristics of the sample, (b) procedures for collecting data, (c) instruments used in the analysis of data, and (d) techniques of analysis. THE SAMPLE In order to define the limits of the generalizations inferred from the results, it is necessary to describe the sample upon which the study relied. The sample is discussed below in terms of selection procedures and the characteristics of families participating in the study. Selection of the Sample The families included in the study were contacted through parents' associations which had been organized to promote the welfare of the men- tally retarded. The associations in the Chicago area were asked to make their mailing lists available to the investigators. Each parent on the list then received a letter requesting his participation in the study. Enclosed with the letter were a reply form and stamped envelope addressed to the Institute for Research on Exceptional Children. In a few parent associations the letters were distributed-by the associations themselves. The majority of associations, however, provided their mailing lists. On the basis of supplementary studies which were conducted to deter- mine sampling bias (Io, Appendix C), it was found that this procedure affected the sample as follows: i. The association lists showed a preponderance of parents from areas of income and education which were higher than the median for Chicago. The lists were especially deficient for predominantly Negro areas. The parents who consented to participate in the study, however, were similar in socioeconomic characteristics to the other parents on the association lists. 2. The parents who had been members of an association for over a year and those who attended meetings frequently were more likely to par- ticipate in the study than were other parents. 3. Asking the parent to return the reply form (so that an interview could be arranged) reduced the proportion of parents who responded but increased the proportion of interviews regarded as valid as compared with home visits without appointment. 4. Parents whose marital integration was low were less likely to par- ticipate in the study than those with high marital integration. 16</page><page sequence="16">PROCEDURES 17 TABLE I ATTRIBUTES OF MEMBERS OF THE 233 FAMILIES INCLUDED IN THE INVESTIGATION Summary Attribute of Individual or Family Description i.

Generally, parents participated in the study either because of their belief in the ultimate value of research or because of group pressures in the parents' associations. Characteristics of the Sample Interviews were conducted in the Chicago area from October, 1955 to December, 1956. Approximately 370 families participated in the investiga- tion. In order to define the limits of the generalizations, analysis of data was restricted to 233 families with the following characteristics: I. Both parents were Caucasian. 2. Only one child in the family was regarded as severely mentally defi- cient by one or both parents. With minor exceptions the mentally retarded child was one with an IQ of 50 or under. 3. The mentally deficient child was aged I6 or under. 4. The parents were married and living together in Chicago or one of its suburbs at the time of the study. 5. The mentally deficient child was born in the present marriage. The specific characteristics of participants are shown in Table i. In general, the parents who participated in the research had been married about 15 years, were in their first marriage, were about 40 years of age, had a median income of nearly $6,ooo per year, had at least a high school education, were in white collar occupations, were native born, and had about three children. In one third of the families, however, there was only one normal child in addition to the retarded child. The religious preference of almost half of the parents was Protestant; approximately one third were Roman Catholic; about one sixth were Jewish; and the remainder reported either no religion or did not respond to the question on religion. COLLECTION OF DATA A staff of Io to 15 part-time interviewers was maintained in Chicago. The majority of the interviewers held graduate degrees in social work, sociology, psychology, or child development. All were experienced inter- viewers. In the collection of data, two interviewers visited each family in their home at an appointed time. While one interviewer talked with the husband, the other interviewed the wife. The interview, which lasted about two and one-half hours, consisted of two parts. The interview forms appear as Appendices A and B in (io). The first section was a face-to-face interview in which the respondent was asked to elaborate on various matters pertaining to the family and the child's handicap. The interviewers recorded the responses verbatim. The second section of the interview consisted of a questionnaire in which the responses required were multiple choice, check mark, or a</page><page sequence="18">PROCEDURES 19 number. The second section of the interview included an index of marital integration, a sibling role-tension index, a marital prediction index, a modi- fication of a Vineland Social Maturity Scale, a social mobility scale, and a neighborliness scale in addition to questions on extended family and personal background. INSTRUMENTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS USED IN ANALYSIS The instruments and classifications used pertained to variables in three parts of the data. The three parts were (a) circumstances in which the family found itself, (b) strategies which the family developed to counteract the crisis, and (c) criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the strategies in counteracting the crisis. The variables pertaining to each of these sections of the data are listed below. Following the list are (a) a description of the categories used in the classifications and (b) a description of the instruments used. I. Variables pertaining to the definition of circumstances facing the family. A. Sex of retarded child B. Marital prediction score C. Social status of parents D. Religion of parents E. Birth order of retarded child II. Variables pertaining to the definition of family strategies. A. Social mobility attitude scale B. Neighborliness C. Social-emotional or companionate valuation D. Identification of husband with wife E. Identification of wife with normal children F. Contact between the wife and her mother G. Extent of interaction between normal and retarded siblings H. Kind of interaction between normal and retarded siblings III. Criteria for evaluating circumstances and family strategies. A. Index of marital integration B. Sibling role tension Classification Pertaining to Circumstances Single-response classifications. Of the- classifications pertaining to cir- cumstances, categories of sex and birth order of the retarded child and social status and religion of the parents were each based on a response to a single question. Birth order of the retarded child pertained to the rank order of the child's chronological age among children in the family now living. Adopted siblings were included in this listing.</page><page sequence="19">20 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS Social status of the parents was based upon the classification of the husband's occupation according to the U. S. Census. Those occupations in the Census categories o, 2, 3, and 4 were considered as white-collar or middle-class. Non-white-collar occupations or lower-class categories were 5, 6, 7, and 9. In the middle-class category are professional and technical workers, managers, officials, proprietors, and clerical and sales workers. The lower-class category consists of craftsmen, foremen, operatives, private household workers, service workers, and laborers (30). Only two categories of religion were used-Roman Catholic and non- Catholic. 'Families were classified as Catholic only if both parents identified themselves Catholic. All other families were considered as non-Catholic. Marital predictiotn score. Various investigators have developed batteries of items which provide a basis for fairly adequate prediction -of marital success (4, pp. 408-429). Even without recourse to events occuring after *the marriage, the researchers can "explain" from one fourth to one third of the total variance in marital success scores by individuals' responses to premarital items. The usefulness of the marital prediction score in the present study, however, was not to "explain" why some parents have a higher marital integration than others. Since the present study was aimed at evaluating effects of a severely retarded child on family integration, some means had to be developed to control other influences on family integration. The statistical control of these influences could then take advantage of studies which showed that (a) certain items relating to the premarital situation are powerful determinants of marital integration and (b) generally the degree of marital integration tends to remain fairly constant from the early to the middle years of marriage (i i). A marital prediction score, modified to include information on the early years of marriage, permitted the control of some of the diverse influences on marital integration. Because of the many factors impinging upon the success of marriage, the aim in the development of the marital prediction score was to obtain the "best"' set of items (aside from effects of the retarded child) for pre- dicting the parents' marital success. This aim implied that a multidimen- sional scale could perform the required task more efficiently than a uni- dimensional scale. Hence, the items comprising the marital prediction score included those which had been statistically significant in at least three studies (4) regardless of their scalability. The procedure for procuring the marital prediction score was described in (ro). Briefly, the husband and wife were each scored on responses to 15 questions relating to their courtship and early marriage and to their own parents. The scoring scheme was based on favorableness to marital success. The scores for the husband and wife were added together to pro- duce a single marriage prediction score for the couple. The maximum</page><page sequence="20">PROCEDURES 21 score was 78 and the minimum was o; the median was 45. In the present study a couple with a score of 45 or over was classified as' having a high marital prediction score. Couples with a score of 44 or lower were regarded as having a low marital prediction score. An evaluation of the items in the marital prediction score showed that for the sample in the present investigation seven items provided much of the discrimination between those parents with a high marital integrationi and those with a low integration. The discriminating items were: i. For the husbands' responses, (a) difficulties of adjustment during the first year, (b) happiness of his mother in her marriage, (c) happiness of his father in his marriage, and (d) his parents' disapproval of his own mar- riage at the time of marriage. 2. For the wives' responses, (a) having doubts about her engagement, (b) the degree of closeness which she felt toward her own mother during childhood, and (c) the frequency of her church attendance early in the marriage. Classifications Pertaining to Family Strategies Contact with wife's mother. Of the classifications pertaining to family strategies, categories of the contact of the wife with her mother were based on a response to a single question. The parents were asked, "Check below how often you see your own parents." The response categories were: I have seen this relative -in the past year: every day, at least once a week, at least once a --ionth, at least once during the year, not at all, and relative not living. In the analysis of the data the wife was regarded as seeing her mother frequently if she saw her mother every day, at least once a week, or at least once a month. All other responses were classified as infrequent. Social mobility attitude index. In the development of an index of propensity toward social mobility, the attitude toward social mobility was regarded as one "good" or "value" in competition with other values. The willingness to be socially mobile was thus inferred from how many other goods the individuals would be willing to sacrifice in order to move upward. The parents were asked, "Getting ahead in occupation or place in the community sometimes means that you have to do certain things you may not like. Which of the following things would you be willing to do in order to get ahead?" In the construction of a scale an attempt was made to list alternative goods of varying degree of sacrifice. The six items in the index were: take on more responsibility, learn new skills, give up spare time, keep quiet about political views, leave your friends, and move around the country a lot. Appropriate modifications in wording were made for the wife's interview form. A high degree of willingness was scored as i and a low degree as o.</page><page sequence="21">22 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS The 31o men and 340 women studied included all parents who provided responses to the questions on social mobility in the interviews-regardless of the age of the retarded child, marital status of the parents, or race. For men the coefficient of reproducibility, which indicates the extent of uni- dimensionality (28), was fairly high throughout the range of scores. However, the coefficients were not sufficiently high to warrant an assump- tion of unidimensionality. For women the coefficient of reproducibility tended to increase in size as the score increased. That is, women who were favorably inclined toward social mobility were more similar in their response patterns than those who were not. In the research, couples in which each parent had a score of 4, 5, or 6 were classified as having a high propensity toward social mobility. When either or both parents scored below 4, the couple was regarded as having a low propensity toward social mobility. Neighborliness scale. The neighborliness scale used in the investigation was developed by P. Wallin (31). As evaluated in two California studies, the scale was found to be a unidimensional Guttman scale. The questions range from: "How many of your best friends who live in your neighbor- hood did you get to know since you or they moved into the neighborhood?" to "How often do you have a talk with any of your neighbors?" With a maximum score of 13 the scale consists of i1 dichotomous items and one trichotomy. Although the California studies gave evidence of unidimensionality, an evaluation of the scale as used by Chicago parents with mentally retarded children showed that scaling errors for four items were too great to permit an assumption of unidimensionality. The items which had relatively few scaling errors were: Do you and your neighbors entertain one another? How many of your neighbors' homes have you been in? How many of your neighbors have ever talked to you about their problems? With how many of your neighbors do you have a frequent friendly talk? About how many of the people in your neighborhood do you say "Hello" or "Good morning" to when you meet in the street? How many names of the families in your neighborhood do you know? and, How often do you have a talk with any one of your neighbors? In the study a score of 9 or over was regarded as high neighborliness; a score below 9 was considered as low neighborliness. Social-emotional (or companionate) valuation by the husband. Social- emotional values are those pertaining to the development of a system of personal relations between family members (cf. 25). In contrast, task- oriented values are those pertaining to the continuity of the family, admin- istration of family affairs, and the place of the family among other institu- tions. An instrument was constructed to determine the extent to which the husband tends to prefer social-emotional or companionate ends in family life to task-oriented ends (9, pp. 122-125).</page><page sequence="22">PROCEDURES 23 Each parent ranked a list of Io values in terms of their importance for family success. The parent's. ranking was then compared with an ideal ranking. Of the io values, companionship, personality development, a home, emotional security, and satisfaction with affection shown were regarded as reflecting a high social-emotional valuation. Task-oriented values were a place in the community, everyday interest, healthy and happy children, moral and religious unity, and economic security. In the ideal ranking the social-emotional values were given a rank of 3 and the task-oriented values were assigned a rank of 8. A Spearman rank correlation was computed between the individual's ranking and the ideal ranking. The higher the correlation coefficient between the individual's ranking and the ideal ranking, the greater is the emphasis upon social-emotional valuation by the individual. In the investigation a social-emotional (or companionate) valuation by the husband was considered high when the correlation coefficient, rho, was +.io or over. When the rho was below +.io, the social-emotional valua- tion was regarded as low. Perceived similarity (or identification) indices. Identification can be regarded as motivation in interpersonal relations (13). By identification is meant "the appropriation of a commitment to a particular identity." An individual develops and orients his activity in terms of this identity. An identity is achieved through consistent naming or labeling. The particular kinds of labeling or naming involved in identification are the simile and metaphor. Hence, any similarity perceived by an individual between him- self and another individual is regarded as an identification of the self with that individual. If the vocabulary of similarity consists of highly personal terms (e.g., stubborn, jealous, depressed), 'we assume that the identification involved is very intimate and highly emotional. The relationship is therefore "primary" (8). To' estimate the amount of interpersonal identification in a particular relationship, an index was developed. The individuals were presented with a list of 16 personality traits. They were asked to rate each family member on every trait on a five-point scale from has trait very much to hasn't trait at all. This list was composed of "positive," "negative," and "neutral" traits. Only io "negative" traits, however, were included in the scoring of the identification index. These traits were stubborn, gets angry easily, feelings easily hurt, nervous or irritable, moody, jealous, dominating or bossy, easily excited, easily depressed, and self-centered. Generally, perceived similarity was scored by adding the number of traits on which the individual marked himself and another person in the same box (e.g., both "very much"). Specifically, in the assessment of the extent of identification of the husband with his wife, the perceived simi- larity scores consisted of the number of times the husband gave his wife and himself the same rating. In the assessment of the extent of identification</page><page sequence="23">24 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS of the wife with a normal child, the perceived similarity score consisted of the number of times that the wife gave a given, normal child and herself the same rating. The identification of a husband with his wife was regarded as high if he gave his wife and himself the same rating on six or more of the io personality traits. The identification was considered as low if only five or fewer ratings were similar. The identification of a wife with at least one normal child was regarded ,as high if the wife gave herself and one of her normal children the same rating on six or more personality traits. The identification was low if she provided only five or fewer similar ratings. Because of the difficulty en- countered by parents in rating very young children, children below the age of two were not included in the data analysis. Interaction between normal and retarded siblings. Ratings were made as to the type and extent of interaction between normal and retarded children on the basis of the mother's responses to several questions. These questions included: (a) Which of the children are together most? What do they do? What about the other children? (b) How did the other chil- dren react when they were told that their brother or sister was retarded? What about now? How do they react to the retarded child at the present time? (c) What is a typical weekday like for you? What do you usually do during the day from the time you get up in the morning until you go to bed at night? The responses were classified on the basis of type and extent of inter- action between normal and retarded siblings. There were nine categories in this classification: (a) little or no participation, (b) equal participation or playmates, (c) retarded child superordinate, (d) retardedchild subordinate, (e) subordination uncertain, (f) parent lumps all siblings together in re- sponse, (g) no siblings, (h) sibling does not live at home with parents, and (i) questions not answered. Two judges classified the case material independently, and differences were reconciled through discussion with the project director. In the description of the types of family orientation the extent of inter- action between normal and retarded siblings was taken into account. For the classification as "high degree of interaction," there had to be an explicit statement that daily interaction occurred between specific siblings. Inter- action of those siblings for whom sufficient information existed was classified as equal or playmate participation, retarded child superordinate, retarded child subordinate, or high participation with subordination unknown. In all other families the degree of interaction between the normal and retarded children was considered as low. In tests of hypotheses on effects of interaction between normal and retarded siblings on the normal children, various other classifications were</page><page sequence="24">PROCEDURES 25 made. These classifications will be discussed in a later section of the mono- graph. Criteria of Family Integration Index of marital integration. Marital integration was regarded as con- sisting of two aspects (9). These were the integration of ends, which was defined as consensus between husband and wife on their ranking of domestic values, and integration of means, which was defined as the mutual coordi- nation of domestic roles. The husband and wife each ranked a list of io domestic values in order of their importance to family success. The list included (a) a place in the community, (b) healthy and happy children, (c) companionship, (d) per- sonality development, (e) satisfaction in affection shown, (f) economic security, (g) emotional security, (h) moral and religious unity, (i) everyday interest, and (j) a home. To provide uniformity in interpretation by the respondent, there was a descriptive statement for each value. To measure the extent of agreement between husband and wife, their rankings were correlated, and the size of the coefficient of rank correlation was regarded as an index of the degree of consensus. The mutual coordination of domestic roles implies that there is (a) agreement or at least consistency between husband and wife on each other's and on one's own expected behavior, (b) agreement between husband and wife as to which expected behavior or role is appropriate for specific kinds of situations, and (c) motivation to conform to the other's expectations and sensitivity to changes in each other's expectations. When these conditions are not fulfilled, the system of marital roles cannot be effectively coordinated. The extent to which the conditions are not fulfilled determines the amount of tension in the system of roles. In the construction of a role tension index, it was assumed that inter- personal conflict or personal frustration may arise when there is much tension in the role system. The character of interpersonal relations would reflect this tension. The husband and wife would then redefine their self- concept and concept of their spouse in terms of a vocabulary of conflict and frustration. They would tend to identify each other and themselves in terms of "negative" personality traits. The ratings by husband and wife on the same io personality traits as those in the perceived similarity indices formed the basis for measuring tension in the system of marital roles. These traits were (a) gets angry easily, (b) stubborn, (c) jealous, (d) irritable, (e) dominating, (f) moody, (g) self-centered, (h) easily hurt, (i) easily excited, and (j) depressed. The items had been selected on the basis of their high loading on a single factor in which marital adjustment was also high. The ratings were made on a five-point scale from has the trait very much to hasn't the trait at a./.</page><page sequence="25">26 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS For each item, "very much" received a -2 and "not at all," a + 2. The scores for the husband's ratings for his wife and himself and the wife's ratings for her husband and herself were added together to provide a role tension score. The consensus and role tension indices were combined arbitrarily by (a) assigning a score of 3 to couples in the top quartile in each index down to a o to those in the lowest quartile and (b) adding each couple's quartile scores for both the consensus and role tension index together to provide a single marital integration score for the couple. Several investigations have been made on the validity and reliability of the marital integration index. Results of these studies have indicated: i. In families with a severely retarded child living at home, there was a positive association between the marital integration score and a report by both parents independently that they themselves and their spouse were happy or very happy in the marriage. There was a negative association between the marital integration score and the report by both husband and wife independently that either of them had ever regretted their marriage (9, PP. 130-r32). 2. When either domestic values were in conflict or the system of marital roles was in tension, the development of patterns of consistent child raising by husband and wife seemed inhibited (12). 3. A test-retest comparison was made for a sample of 6o Catholic families with adolescent children after a lapse of nine months. On the second test 52 couples scored within two units of the marital integration score of the first test. Another couple who had scored fairly low the first time, 2, had legally separated in the interim. The remaining seven cases were examined to determine whether reasons for the shift in score could be found. In three of the deviant cases there was concrete evidence of an event which had precipitated a rift in marital relations. In two other cases there was some evidence that a critical event such as menopause or preparing for migration to another city had occurred. In the remaining two cases both the first and second interviewers reported that the homes "swirled" with confusion. They pointed out the large number of children and inadequate housing of both families. For these two families the instability of the integration score probably reflected confusion in the family life. Sibling role tension index. The assumptions of the role tension index for normal siblings are similar to those underlying the index of marital role tension (io, Appendix E). Conflict and frustration in interaction leads the parent to identify the child in terms of uncomplimentary personal attributes. The io items comprising the index were the same ones that were used in the marital role tension index. Also as in the marital index, the ratings were made on a five-point scale and the extreme favorable rating received a +2 and the extreme unfavorable rating, a -2. The scores for the indi-</page><page sequence="26">PROCEDURES 27 vidual personality traits were added; the higher the numerical score, the lower is the role tension. Because of the greater contact between the mother and young children than between the father and children, the mothei's ratings were used as a basis for the score. In 69 families with young adolescents, it was found that: i. When the mother's ratings for only the oldest child aged 15 or undcr in each family were used, the amount of role tension was positively corre- lated with the number of child's activities with which the mother was dissatisfied. 2. When the mother's responses for two of her children were compared, the mother tended to provide a lower score (i.e., higher role tension) for the child whose behavior she found more dissatisfying (so, Appendix E). The relationship between chronological age and role tension scores was studied for 41 sisters in the present sample who interacted frequently with their mentally retarded sibling. The girls were ranked by their age, with the youngest child receiving a rank of one; they were also ranked by role tension score, with the highest score (i.e., lowest role tension) receiving a rank of one. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient, tau, was relatively low, -.21, but statistically significant at the .03 level (z = 1.93). This result is consistent with the statement that, as children grow older and are able to maintain adequate self-control in their conduct, the amount of tension in the mother-daughter system of roles should decline somewhat. A\ALYSIS OF THE DATA Inasmuch as most decisions affecting the analysis of the data have been described in (io), the discussion below merely summarizes these decisions as they pertain to the present monograph: i. Since the quantitative data in the study are regarded as ordinal (i.e., capable of being ranked) rather than cardinal (i.e., an equal interval scale with a zero point), nonparametric tests of significance and rank correla- tion techniques were applied. The test of significance used to examine most hypotheses was the Mann-Whitney U test. This test is highly efficient as compared with t tests in making inferences as to whether the "bulk" of one population is higher in rank than the "bulk" of another population. The formula used took into account ties in rank. The .05 level of signifi- cance was applied as the basis for accepting or rejecting null hypoth- eses (27). 2. Mean scores are reported in the monograph to communicate the extent of differences between samples. However, the means are not used to calculate tests of statistical significance. 3. The qualitative analyses discussed in the monograph were performed with the open-ended responses in the face-to-face oral interview.</page><page sequence="27">28 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS 4. Although the monograph on the first phase of the analysis reported on 240 families, in the present monograph only 233 families appear in the sample. In the present analysis many of the classifications were made on the basis of combinations of husband and wife responses. It was not possible to estimate these combinations when the husband did not participate in the research. Hence, six cases for which an estimate had been made in the first phase of analysis of the couple's marital integration on the basis of the wife's form were eliminated from the second phase. In a seventh case the husband's form was incomplete. 5. The marital integration score was found to be uncorrelated with the number of children in the family. 6. The distribution of marital integration scores of parents with a child in a private institution was not markedly different (to the extent of statis- tical significance) from the distribution of scores of parents with a child in the Lincoln or Dixon State School.</page><page sequence="28">FAVORABLENESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES CONCERNING RETARDED CHILD In the conceptual model which forms the basis for the analysis of data, variables which are supposed to influence marital integration of parents are of two kinds. In keeping with the analogy of games of strategy with Nature as one player, the first class of strategies pertains to moves of Nature. In this study strategies of Nature consist of combinations of those moves over which members of a family have little or no control, e.g., circumstances concerning the retarded child. The second class of strategies consists of moves developed by the members of the family and will be discussed in a later section. If Nature is considered a player in the game of Family Crisis, we must assume a form of pay-off to Nature. If marital integration is regarded as a commodity, the aim of Nature is to minimize the couple's marital integra- tion and, figuratively, to maximize its own anti-integration. Hence, the pay-off to Nature, according to assumptions ascribed to A. Wald (23), would be the maximum possible marital integration score minus the actual integration score achieved by the couple. In the study, moves of Nature were grouped into categories which (a) described sets of circumstances which constitute the strategies of Nature and (b) classified these circumstances as favorable, unfavorable, or unpre- dictable with respect to the marital integration of the parents of the re- tarded children. DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES Two criteria were used to describe a set of circumstances surrounding the retarded child as favorable, unpredictable, or unfavorable. The first criterion was the size of the mean marital integration score for that set of circumstances. A set of circumstances was regarded as favorable when the mean marital integration score was 4.00 or over. Circumstances were re- garded as unfavorable when the mean integration score for that set was 2.99 or under. Sets of circumstances under which parents had a mean marital integration score of 3.00-3.99 were regarded as unpredictable. The second criterion for classifying combinations of circumstances as to their favorableness was the internal consistency among the circumstances. The internal consistency was ascertained by classifying the sets of circum- stances on the basis of (a) the sex of the child, (b) religion, (c) social class, (d) marital prediction score of the parents, and (e) birth order of the child. 29</page><page sequence="29">30 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS The classification of circumstances as favorable, unpredictable, or un- favorable was based upon a list of propositions. Most of the propositions had been tested on the same sample to which this analysis is being applied (ro). The remainder were drawn from case material and were consistent with the general statement that having a retarded child tends to induce arrest in the family cycle and that this arrest inhibits the marital integra- tion of the parents. Arrest in the family life-cycle describes simply what would happen to the process of integrating family life if no counteracting measures were taken by the parents. Relative to expectations for normal children, the se- verely retarded child would fall farther and farther behind. As a conse- quence, the family would never reach a mature stage, in which all children have married and the parents have "retired" from family raising. There would always remain the severely retarded person, always a "young child." Hence, arrest in the family life-cycle can be regarded as the manner by which Nature organizes its moves in the fictional game of Family Crisis. It seems that the extent to which arrest occurs determines the unfavorable- ness of Nature's strategies for the degree of family integration. Thus, an unfavorable circumstance would be one in which arrest in the family cycle is maximized; a favorable circumstance would be one in which Nature has been inefficient in inhibiting the development of the family cycle. The relationship between arrest in the family cycle and family integra- tion can be described from the parents' viewpoint. For the parents, arrest in the family cycle describes the process by which they anticipate or experience the halting effect of the retarded child's slow or decelerating development on their own life careers (cf. io). Faced with a set of circumstances different from other parents, the father and mother of a retarded child must develop their own norms and values for main- taining family solidarity. Unlike other parents, however, these parents cannot receive the benefit of broad group experiences in the development of family roles appropriate to the problems raised by the presence of a retarded child. With respect to norms and insight of other families, the family with a retarded child is often alienated and sometimes socially isolated. Lack of a tradition of family values and roles appropriate to raising a retarded child and limita- tion on the consensual validation (or emotional support) for values and roles actually developed would facilitate doubt and disagreement as to the efficacy of the parents' values and roles. The doubt and disagreement is reflected in (a) tension in the system of family roles and (b) a widening gap in the life (and family) goals of the family members. Inasmuch as family integration is defined in terms of the amount of tension in the system of family roles and consensus on values, the doubt and disagreement also indicates a decrease in family integration.</page><page sequence="30">FAVORABLENESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES 31 The classification of circumstances as favorable, unpredictable, or un- favorable to marital integration was based upon the following propositions: i. The marital integration of parents with severely mentally retarded boys tends to be lower than that of parents with retarded girls. 2. Parents whose marital integration prior to the birth of a severely retarded child (i.e., marital prediction score) was low tend to have a lower marital integration than parents whose early marital integration (marital prediction score) was high. 3. Middle-class parents of severely mentally retarded boys tend to have a higher marital integration than lower-class parents of retarded boys. 4. The marital integration of Catholic parents of retarded boys is less affected by the retarded child than that of non-Catholic parents of retarded boys. 5. Among Catholics, a first-born mentally retarded boy affects the par- ents' marital integration less severely than does a not-first-born boy. 6. Among non-Catholics, a first-born mentally retarded boy affects the parents' marital integration more severely than does a not-first-born boy. 7. Among middle-class families, the marital integration of non-Catholic parents of retarded girls is less affected than the marital integration of Cath- olic parents of retarded girls. 8. The marital integration of parents of not-first-born retarded girls is less affected than the marital integration of parents of first-born retarded girls. The object of the classification was to place the families of retarded children into categories of favorableness with respect to marital integration without violating the general tendencies described in the propositions. The results pertaining to internal consistency appear in Table 2. Diffi- culties in classification arise when the circumstances of a given family are favorable with respect to one proposition and unfavorable with respect to a second proposition. The problems were whether (a) the favorableness in one category outweighed the unfavorableness in another and (b) the combination made a third characteristic inoperative. For example, for non- Catholic parents, the combination of middle-class family with a not-first- born retarded boy as opposed to a lower-class family with a first-born re- tarded boy seemed to outweigh the importance of the early marital integra- tion in determining the integration at the time of the study. Each case was first classified according to sex of child, marital prediction score of parents (high or low), social class (middle or lower), religious identification of parents (Catholic or non-Catholic), and birth order of the retarded child (first-born or not-first-born). This classification provided 32 categories. The second step in the analysis was to compute the mean marital integration score for the cases in each category. The third step was to place the family in one of three categories by mean marital integration score-</page><page sequence="31">32 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS TABLE 2 CLASSIFICATION OF COMBINATIONS OF CIRCUMSTANCES ON BASIS OF THEIR FAVORABLENESS TO THE MARITAL INTEGRATION OF PARENTS OF SEVERELY MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN C I R CU M S.T ANCES M Eta Favorableness Marital Birth Order Inte- of the Set of Prediction Social of Retarded No. of gration Circumstances Score Status Religion Child Cases Score Set No. sza - Boy Favorable* .....

The fourth step was to determine whether the tendencies described in the propositions were consistent with the data. In determining the consistency between the classification for the five attributes and size of mean marital integration scores, two problems were encountered. First, the 32 categories had to be grouped into sets which could be regarded as strategies of Nature. A second problem was that the number of cases in many of the categories was small, and therefore the mean marital integration scores obtained were unreliable. Categories were therefore com- bined on the basis of both their consistency with the list of propositions and the classification of marital integration score means as favorable, unpre- dictable, and unfavorable. When there was an inconsistency between the two criteria for classifying categories, the categories were examined to see whether eliminating one of the characteristics (such as religious identification) from consideration re- moved the inconsistency in classification. If disregarding a given character- istic made the mean marital integration scores of categories, which were otherwise identical in the remaining characteristics, consistent with the list of propositions, the "offending" characteristic was removed from consider- ation. For example, in Table 2 for characteristics ia, it was found that all categories in which middle-class, Catholic parents of a retarded boy had a high marital prediction score had a mean marital integration score of 4.0 or higher, regardless of the birth order of the boy. To have differentiated between the categories in classifying them as to favorableness by birth order would have violated proposition 5 in the list. By disregarding birth order for circumstances ia, we are assuming that the weight of the combina- tion of high marital prediction and middle-class status is so overwhelming toward favorableness that birth order makes little difference in determining the marital integration of the parents. Following the procedure outlined in the example regarding circum- stance Ia, seven sets of circumstances were developed. These sets of circum- stances and their subclassifications constitute the strategies of Nature against which family members must orient themselves to maintain high marital integration. As shown in Table 2, the sets of circumstances were concerned with the following: ia. Those Catholic families with a retarded boy not in circumstance 2. ib. Those non-Catholic families with a retarded boy not in circum- stances ic or 2. ic. Lower-class, non-Catholic families with a retarded boy who is not the first-born child.

Middle-class families with a retarded girl in which the marital pre- diction score is high. Birth order of the retarded child is disregarded and religious identification is permitted to vary. 4. Middle-class families with a retarded girl in which the marital pre- diction score is high. Religious identification is disregarded and birth order of the retarded child is permitted to vary. 5. Families with a retarded girl in which the marital prediction score of the parents is low. There were too few cases in this category to permit subclassifications. CIRCUMSTANCES AND MARITAL INTEGRATION The results of the classification of families according to the sets of circumstances in terms of consistency between circumstances and expected marital integration appear below: I. Results concerning families with a retarded boy. A. Among Catholic families with a high marital prediction score, i. Middle-class parents (disregarding birth order) had a higher marital integration than 2. Lower-class parents of a not-first-born retarded boy. B. Among lower-class Catholic families, i. Parents whose retarded child was their first-born (disregarding marital prediction score) tended to have a higher marital inte- gration than 2.

Comparison of results for families with retarded boys with those for families with retarded girls: Whereas for all sets of circumstances regarding retarded boys, category of "unfavorableness" existed, the minimum category for retarded girls was "unpredictable." In general, the results on the effects of circumstances regarding the retarded child on marital integration of his parents indicated that: I. The marital prediction score (or imputed early marital integration of the couple) had the most pervasive influence of all five characteristics on marital integration at the time of the study (e.g., in Table 2, circumstances Ic and ie). 2. The influence of birth order of the retarded child and social status of the parents upon the degree of marital integration of the parents was contingent upon the religious identification of the parents. Effects of reli- gious identification upon the parents' marital integration were in turn dependent upon the sex of the child (e.g., classifications Ib and Id in Table 2). 3. Only certain combinations of sex of the child, religious identification, birth order, and social class could outweigh the influence of early marital integration (or marital prediction score) upon the degree of marital integra- tion at the time of the study (e.g., in Table 2, classifications ia, Ib, 3, 4, and 5).</page><page sequence="35">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION In this section the strategies developed by the families with mentally retarded children will be discussed. These strategies constitute the major hypotheses of the study. First, the theoretical background for these strategies will be presented. Secondly, case material pertaining to these strategies will be analyzed. Then, indices for classifying families by strategy employed will be described. Finally, consequences of these strategies for the ranking of domestic values by family members will be discussed. BASIS FOR CLASSIFICATION The distinction between the institutional family and the companionate family has been made by Burgess and Locke (4; 5, pp. 25-32). They have based this distinction on the sources of social control for the family unit. The control of family behavior in the institutional family is derived from sources outside the immediate (or nuclear) family. The control of family behavior in the companionate family is derived from mutual affection and aims toward mutual compatibility of the family members. In their concep- tual scheme Burgess and Locke do not regard families as being unified by both internal and external forces. The Burgess and Locke family typology seems to leave the following empirical and theoretical problems unsolved: i. Are institutional and companionate types related to specific kinds of community relations? Their typology implies that the institutional family has strong community ties while the companionate family has a more or less symbiotic relationship with the rest of the community. Yet, Burgess' research indicated that in his middle-class sample both husband and wife strained toward upward mobility (5; cf. 32). What seemed to be occurring was that the community participation in the companionate family was merely based on more symbolic and instrumental motivations. 2. In reviewing case material on families with severely retarded children, we found that one pattern which parents developed was a lowering of their level of occupational aspiration and a focusing of their lives around the home. On an intuitive basis it was noted that these families seemed to be "well-integrated." On various characteristics this family type did not seem to fit the companionship-institution continuum. For example, the primary source of emotional support of the parents came from within the family; at the same time, like parents in the institutional family, these parents placed much emphasis on healthy and happy children. 36</page><page sequence="36">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 37 Community Priorities and Emotional Satisfaction Perhaps another scheme which may produce meaningful results in terms of highly integrated families is a classification of nuclear families on the basis of both source of parents' emotional satisfaction and their definition of their preferred life career patterns. (A career pattern is the specific pro- gression of roles through which a person moves in the course of his life.) In urban communities activity of family members in other institutions in the community affects the integration of the family itself. The parents can develop strategies for maintaining or increasing their commitment and consequent participation in other institutions and thus give priority to the development of a successful career in these institutions. Or the parents can develop a different set of strategies for withdrawing from a good many activ- ities in the community and thereby give priority to their domestic careers. Commitment and participation in institutions in the community other than the family are regarded in this monograph primarily in terms of the middle-class social system. The middle-class social system is regarded as oriented toward achievement in socioeconomic status. The symbols of middle-class achievement are signs of "getting ahead" in occupation and especially consumption. Degree of commitment and participation in the middle-class system thus are regarded as the extent to which the individuals wish to get ahead in occupation or place in the community. A scheme for classifying families by their orientation in resolving con- flicts between intrafamily commitments and commitments in the middle- class social system was developed. The concepts used in describing family orientation and its reflection in the internal family relations of the parents are described below. Motiva- tion in family orientation is based upon (a) commitment by the parents to given priorities in sequence of roles (i.e., their preferences) and (b) the source of emotional support in reinforcing their commitment to certain preferences. It is assumed that conflicts arise between the middle-class career and domestic career and that the parents must give priority to one career consistently if they are to minimize tension in the system of family roles. In this study the parents are regarded as having to choose between achievement in (a) the middle-class status system and (b) their home life by giving priority to one sequence of roles. Related to the problem of commitment to career is that of source of emotional support for this commitment. The perspective of the persons or groups who reinforce the career commitment would affect the degree of the parents' consistent commitment to a given career pattern. The sources of emotional support considered in this study are (a) the spouse and (b) insti- tutions, reference groups, or significant persons outside the nuclear family. It is reasonable to assume that the priority in career development and source of emotional support would be reflected in the internal relationships</page><page sequence="37">38 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS of the family. In relation to the spouse, motivation in family orientation can be reflected in (a) a traditional-rigid division of labor between husband and wife and (b) a companionate-flexible division of labor between husband and wife. In relation to the children, motivation in family orientation can produce (a) extrinsic valuation (i.e., stress on achievement of the child) and (b) intrinsic valuation (i.e., interaction for the sake of interaction with the specific person) of varying degrees (cf. 2). It is contended that these concepts define the content of the major strategies of the parents in family organization. Although there are I6 possible combinations of the above four characteristics, an assumption was made that certain combinations (e.g., parent-oriented family) may diminish the importance of some attributes (e.g., relation to children). The stimulus to select combinations of attributes as leading to high marital integration came from the games-of-strategy model. The construc- tion of specific combinations, which were regarded as integrative orienta- tions, was based on assumptions made about family structure. Agreement of the parents on goals and consistency in their coordination of family roles (i.e., high marital integration) presuppose that certain conditions related to family structure must be present. In accordance with the discussion of role differentiation by Parsons and Bales (25; cf. 9), it was assumed that the wife's role revolves around the home while the husband's role is primarily aimed at relating the home to the community. That is, the wife is generally responsible for the internal relations of the family whereas the husband is responsible for keeping the family as a going concern in relation to the rest of the community. Insofar as this division of roles occurs, the wife is in the position of balancing the demands of the husband with those of the children. Successful mediation by the wife of the husband's and children's needs and demands would be necessary for the smooth coordination of activities within the family. The problem of successful mediation of demands of husband and chil- dren raises the further question of specifying conditions in interpersonal relations which are conducive to smooth coordination of family activities by the wife. Generally, the task of the husband in achieving high marital integration is to adapt his family role in such a way as to minimize contradictory de- mands made on his wife.' Theoretically, minimizing the demands of the 1 The view of family structure and the part played by the husband in the achievement of high marital integration are consistent with research on marriage prediction and sta- bility of family life. For example, the study of the Negro family has clearly indicated the greater stability of the mother's role than the father's role in the family. Research on marriage prediction generally indicates that the husband's premarital attributes play a more important role in marital success than the wife's. Both avenues of research suggest that the wide range of choice of activity of the husband as compared with that of the wife is responsible for the extent to which he influences tension in the system of roles in their family.</page><page sequence="38">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 39 husband can be accomplished in one of three ways: (a) by instituting a sharp division of labor, (b) by a coalition between husband and wife in giving priority to social-emotional tasks in structuring family life, and (c) by a coalition between husband and wife in giving priority to achieving goals in the community social structure.2 These three strategies can be de- scribed in terms of persons whose demands and needs are given priority in family life. The strategies are described below: i. The child-oriented strategy: The parents agree that the most impor- tant task in family life is the maintenance of the family unit as an ongoing concern vis-ca-vis all other social systems. For the husband this goal would imply that he must concentrate on securing the artifacts and economic and moral stability required for family continuity. Inasmuch as family continuity presupposes the presence of normal children to provide this continuity to the group, the husband would place a high valuation on children. The consistent pursuit of these goals by the husband would not place the wife in the position of having to mediate between the husband's demands within the family and her activities aimed at fulfilling her own ends for the chil- dren. Essentially, through a division of labor, both parents would structure their family life around the needs and demands of the normal children. Since it is assumed here that parents try to reproduce their own norms and values in their children, especially boys would be valued for their potentiali- ties for achievement; girls would be valued more or less intrinsically (cf. 2). 2. The home-oriented strategy: The husband minimizes the importance of the task of relating the family unit to external systems and emphasizes the internal structuring of the family. Severe conflicts between demands by the husband and children would be obviated by the husband's joining forces with his wife in the social-emotional patterning of family life. Since, by occupational role and tradition, the husband is also the instrumental leader in the family, through common interests or high personal identifica- tion with the wife, the husband here would be the central figure of the family. Since the husband takes on a social-emotional task, the division of parental labor in the family would be minimized; both parents would con- centrate on structuring congenial interpersonal relations in the home. (This orientation assumes that there is present a minimum economic and moral stability regarded as sufficient by the husband and wife.) With the de- emphasis on achievement in the middle-class status system, both boys and girls would be valued "intrinsically" and their mental health stressed. 3. The parent-oriented strategy: The husband and wife agree that the demands of the children be subordinated to those pertaining to the hus- band's role. The husband's demands are associated with problems of achievement in the middle-class status system in the community. The pri- mary task of the wife become those of (a) reinforcing such goals as the 2 These are ideal typical approaches; in actual family living complete consistency is obviously impossible.</page><page sequence="39">40 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS attainment of artifacts and social contacts symbolic of success in middle- class society and (b) developing necessary skills to collaborate with her husband in his work or social contact in the community. To compensate for the wife's assumption of achievement functions, the husband would have to perform some of the social-emotional tasks ordinarily performed by the wife. Hence, partnership norms such as companionate practices in family life would be developed. Inasmuch as family life would be built around achievement, personal development and social skills would be emphasized. The children, too, regardless of sex, would be expected to learn the social skills necessary for middle-class advancement. It is suggested that other- directedness, nursery school popularity, and "professionalization" of parent- hood are consequences of an increasing amount of parent-orientation of family life. The types of family orientation are summarized in Table 3. The table indicates the manner in which these types are expected to differ in parents' (a) source of emotional support, (b) interaction with and valuation of chil- dren, (c) daily routine and division of labor, and (d) community partici- pation as a reflection of career priorities.

On the other hand, while children are not a crucial element in the parent-oriented family, both the home- oriented and child-oriented parents place a high valuation on children. A sharp division of labor between husband and wife characterizes the child- oriented family; there is, however, much haziness in defining the husband's and wife's specific duties in the home-oriented and parent-oriented families. Finally, formal community participation is especially important for the child-oriented families, somewhat less important for the parent-oriented families, and of little importance to the home-oriented families. This does not imply that home-oriented families have no community participation; it merely suggests that community participation for these families occurs more often in the home setting. The types of family orientation were developed to permit a classification of all families in the sample in terms of their consistency in social organiza- tion. An empirical index for classifying each family was constructed in several steps. i. Interviews for over 50 families were categorized intuitively as child- oriented, parent-oriented, home-oriented, and unclassifiable. The basis for classification was roughly the correspondence between the interview ma- terial and the attributes listed in Table 3. 2. On the basis of the conceptual scheme, a tentative list of indices in the available data was made for each type of family orientation. 3. Three or four families of each type of orientation, regarded intuitively as "representative" of that orientation, were analyzed according to the four concepts. 4. In order to minimize discrepancies between the objective indices and the case material, the indices of family orientation were revised. In the remainder of this section the discussion will center upon (a) examples of each type of family orientation, (b) a description of the objec- tive indices of the types, and (c) an evaluation of these indices. EXAMPLES OF TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION Two examples of each type of family orientation are presented below. These cases were selected for presentation because they were regarded as "representative" of each type. The rationale for including certain character- istics for each family type is described in the various discussions of the case material pertaining to family orientations. No assumption was made in the analysis as to whether a particular family orientation was developed prior to or following the parents' defining their child as mentally retarded. In the development or loss of family orien- tations there are the following possibilities:</page><page sequence="41">42 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS i. A given strategy (e.g., child-oriented) was present before the defini- tion of the child as retarded, and the parents maintained the same strategy afterwards. 2. The parents had no consistent family orientation before the retarded child, but developed this orientation as a reaction to the presence of the retarded child. 3. The parents maintained one kind of orientation (e.g., parent-oriented) prior to the presence of the retarded child, but shifted to a second kind of orientation (e.g., home-oriented) afterwards. 4. A given orientation was present before the definition of the child as retarded, but was lost. 5. Neither before nor after the definition of the child as mentally re- tarded had the parents been able to develop a consistent orientation. The case material was not sufficiently detailed to enable a reliable judg- ment of the family situation prior to the definition of the child as mentally retarded. In the cases below, all families have at least one normal child in addition to the retarded child. In the presentation the name of a retarded boy will be Raymond and that of a retarded girl, Ramona. The oldest normal brother will be called Norman and the oldest normal girl, Norma. In the examples the case material is placed in categories of (a) source of emotional support and satisfaction, (b) interaction with and valuation of children, (c) division of labor and daily routines at home, and (d) com- munity participation. Obviously, some material is descriptive of family life as it pertains to several categories. To repeat the information, however, seemed wasteful of space and therefore information was classified arbi- trarily in only one of the appropriate categories. I. CHILD-ORIENTED FAMiLY A A. Source of Emotional Support and Satisfaction Husband. This particular job that I have is one that keeps every minute of every day occupied. I have no time to brood or feel sorry for myself. Sometimes I don't know if I run the job or it runs me. .... Ramona's played an important part in our lives. More particularly mine. I think I had an awful lot to learn. I had a lot of ambition and push and never had been defeated in anything before. I had to really learn to take defeat and she helped me to learn to take it... My wife has accepted it with graciousness and understanding. I don't think I recog- nized the seriousness of the problem or accepted it. Little by little you learn to accept it and live with it. I used to look at other people and wonder how they could love that kind of child, but now I see it. I almost worship that kid. Wife. My mother lives with us. . ... The child may tend to make us more nervous. There are certain problems that tend to cause more of a nervous nature. I don't believe I noticed any great change. We learned to live with the situation. I don't think we could have enjoyed her more immensely and have been closer to her because of her condition. We have never given up hope.</page><page sequence="42">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 43 B. Interaction with and Valuation of Children Husband. Possibly this was wrong, but for a while, we kept it from Norma. We finally told her about it and being the kind of person she is, she accepted it as part of the family. Norma does not resent her at all. I've told Norma many times that this will not affect her life. Wife. Yesterday, after dinner, we drove Norma and her friends to a movie- we provided the transportation there and then came home and watched TV.... I believe that Norma was nine years old when we found out Ramona was re- tarded, and Norma was too young. She just has grown up with her and accepts it without knowing otherwise. Interviewer. On the night of the interview Norma went to a carnival with her friends. C. Division of Labor and Daily Routine at Home Husband. (Father-Child Interaction): Gosh, Ramona and I play ball together, we wrestle together, go for rides and walks together. (Note: Father, gets home from work at 7:30; supper is at 8:00; Ramona goes to bed at 9:00.) Wife. (Mother-Child Interaction): We do most everything together except when she is in school. She is my constant companion. Interviewer. In discussing his daily routine as well as in his description of his interaction with other family members, the husband nowhere indicated any in- volvement in household chores or child care. D. Community Participation Husband. I felt, when I was being promoted higher and higher, that I was traveling too much and leaving the burden of Ramona's care to my wife. I re- signed and we moved to Chicago. In no time, I found myself again working my- self up to a big position. This meant traveling, but not nearly as much as before. This has affected our whole life. ... We're all great television fans. Once in a while, we have company and maybe visit some, but not as much as if this con- dition (Ramona's) wasn't present. . ... We don't entertain as much with Ramona in the condition she is. We would do more if she were more advanced. Wife. (No additional information.) II. CHILD-ORIENTED FAMILY B A. Source of Emotional Support and Satisfaction (Note: Marital integration score of couple is low.) Husband. I devote most of my time to Norman when I'm not working days. We go scouting in the woods, take out the dog, build model airplanes-various different activities he may dream up .... Because of Raymond, we were divorced. Frankly, it was my fault. I didn't spend as much time with him as my wife did. I couldn't see placing him. After we separated, I came to see her point of view. After placing him, we got back together again. Wife. My husband was not home enough to really see the disturbance caused by the child. I broke up our marriage and placed Raymond in an institution against my husband's wishes. After the whole thing, I got very upset and con- fused. My husband's first reaction was to become very attached to Raymond. The actual break-up between us was due to mother-in-law trouble, finances, and my being tied down. But the presence of Raymond brought more tension and aggra- vated everything. My mother-in-law blamed me for the abnormal child. (The wife's mother is dead.) My husband now accepts the placement of the child as the</page><page sequence="43">44 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS only solution to maintain a home life, but he doesn't accept it completely. He is still very attached to Raymond and would like to have him closer to home. Interviewer. After the interview the wife said that there were marital diffi- culties from the very beginning. The husband was torn between his loyalty to his mother and his wife. She expressed some concern over Norman's growing up like his father, i.e., attached to his mother's apron strings. B. Interaction with and Valuation of Children Husband. We placed Raymond in an institution strictly because of the other child. We felt it would be detrimental to the normal child. Reason number two: it caused that rift between my wife and myself.... We've got a lot of plans for Norman . . . strictly what he wants .... Only one plan-that I won't push my ideas on the child. . ... Give him the best possible education that he wants, with- out pushing him into any particular field. Wife. Norman and I spend a lot of time together. We read. I take him out a lot for recreation-miniature golf, visiting. He spends much more time with me than most children. Both children were with me very much because of my husband's irregular hours .... I'm against pushing an abnormal child onto the normal one and have them responsible or take care of them. I'm against having the normal child suffer. He should come first. You do get more pleasure out of the normal ones. They're the ones you live for. It's nice to help the others, but eventually the normal ones give you something the others don't. . . . We have three generations of artists in my family, but I wouldn't want Norman in that. I'd like a profession of some kind for him, like a lawyer or doctor. C. Division of Labor and Daily Routine at Home Husband. (The description of the daily routine showed almost a total in- volvement in business and plans for expansion of the business. The workday was 14 hours long and the remainder of the time was spent on meals. The husband alternated working days and nights. He remarked, "No day is typical.") Wife. (No additional information.) D. Comnmunity Participation Husband. (The erratic pattern and large number of working hours would hinder social contact with friends and neighbors. There was no indication of sociability in the husband's interview.) Wife. In the afternoon, I usually clean up, go shopping, or visit my neighbors. This is a clannish neighborhood, which I like to some extent. I like to be sociable, but only with a few and I like the feelings of privacy .... In the evenings, when my husband is home, we watch TV and read. Norman usually wants our atten- tion and to play games with him. We spend a lot of time with him when my husband is home, too. Once a week, the girls and I have a card game here. In both child-oriented families, it seemed that: I. The source of emotional support for the parents was outside the nuclear family.The husbands were highly oriented toward their occupations. One husband felt that he "was run" by his job. The second husband worked highly irregular and long hours. Their wives seemed involved in their extra- family contacts. One of them enjoyed her "clannish" neighborhood and card games with the girls. The wife's mother in the first family lived with them.</page><page sequence="44">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 45 It is pertinent that in the second case, where the wife not only received no emotional support from her parents, but also opposition from her husband's, the marital integration was low. 2. The mothers in both families found that their children were their constant companions. The fathers seemed to have little contact with their children, but were highly attached to them. Both fathers were deeply emo- tionally involved with their retarded children. The children seemed to be the main bond between the husband and wife. 3. Tasks in the home seemed sharply divided along sexual lines. Hus- bands did not indicate giving any help to their wives in housework; wives did not help their husbands. The specific rights and duties of husband and wife seemed well-defined. In general, the child-oriented family resembled the patriarchal type traditional in Europe. The husband administered the economic affairs and the wife, the domestic matters. Family continuity might well describe the general value involved in the family's integration. III. HOME-ORIENTED FAMILY A A. Source of Emotional Support and Satisfaction Husband. (Advice to Other Parents): Make the best of what you've got. I know plenty of childless couples who have empty, barren lives. . . . There is a tendency to feel sorry for yourself. You have to accept your life and lead a normal life. Don't make the child the center of your life. It is not good for yourself or the child. You ought to go to a ball game or go fishing. If you could afford a nurse, leave the children and get away for a while. Do anything to keep the par- ents mentally healthy. If you lose that, you don't have anything. .... We all eat breakfast and I leave. We kiss good-bye-all four of us. If I miss anyone, Ramona reminds me.... When I get home in the evening, both of the kids jump on me. I have to pick them up and hold them both at the same time or they get jealous. I then kiss my wife. Wife. Well, my husband is a little more stoical than I. He doesn't take things to heart as much. He doesn't show his emotions too much and I wouldn't say just how deeply he felt it.... I think more of our problems that lie ahead. I haven't faced the problem completely in that I haven't told everybody about her. Not all the family has seen her and, even if they see her, it's not apparent, so I don't tell. The neighbors know, but some of our friends and relatives don't. The immediate family knows. B. Interaction with and Valuation of Children Husband. We were downhearted, not for ourselves, but for the child. I was sad, but if that's the way it is supposed to be, that's the way it is. Now, I am not downcast. . ... Both my wife and I come from large families and we always wanted to have a large family of our own. Wife. (No additional information.) C. Division of Labor and Routine at Home Husband. I am up at 6:30, not because I want to, but because one of the kids is up by then. I go into the room of the child who is up and put on her house-</page><page sequence="45">46 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS coat. The kids like to watch me shave and they follow me into the bathroom. They also like for me to put my electric razor next to their faces. I wash the face of the child who is up. Then she will follow me into the bedroom and watch me dress. They also help by putting away my slippers and getting my shoes. All of this is daily routine. By this time, my wife gets up; she can't sleep with all this noise.... I also carry out the garbage before I go. In the winter, I would shovel the snow. . ... (In the evening,) after we eat, I put Ramona to bed. I change all the diapers. The kids prefer me to care for them. They have more fun with me- I fool around with them. Wife. Between 6:30 and 7:00, I get up and spend my time giving them their breakfast, taking care of their physical needs, changing diapers, and so on. I try to get in some typing for my husband right after breakfast if I can. If it is nice, I send them out to play. In summer, I'll have one of the neighbors' children to watch over them. After lunch, I try to keep them busy or have one of the neigh- bors' children in to keep them quiet so I can work. I hardly ever get out. D. Community Participation Husband. After both kids are in bed, which is between 7:45 and 8:00, we are on our own. I might look at the newspapers or do some work such as going over my letters or my files. I also have plenty of work to do in the basement. Maybe once a week, I'll watch TV. As you can see, we are not club people who are always going out.... My wife has her hands full-mending, doing the dishes, and some- times she does some typing for me. She also talks to her relatives and friends on the phone. We are in bed by 11:00. Wife. (Advice to Other Parents): Just try to carry on-lead as normal a life as possible. Don't isolate yourself in any way. I don't know if I'm doing that too well, but I'd advise somebody else to try.... My husband doesn't see too much of me except on weekends. I spend the evening doing household chores I couldn't do during the day or some more office work. There's very little relaxing, almost no TV. We go to bed around 11:00. IV. HOME-ORIENTED FAMILY B A. Source of Emotional Support and Satisfaction Husband. I am home at 6:05. Everyone greets me-the dog, the cat, the two kids, and my wife. I get a kiss from each of them. I get into some slacks and come down for supper. All four of us are together. Normally, I don't allow TV during supper. I think you lose the family feeling. I don't like to have interruptions during supper. We have a little prayer at supper with all of us holding hands. ... My wife and I discuss things pretty much and have a pretty open relationship. It is important for people to be able to discuss one's problems and work them out. Wife. We have run the gamut of emotions, you might say, from struggling with our soul to wrestling with our problems. I would say it has drawn us even closer together. My husband has taught me to be patient and stop kicking myself. He's taught me that I can't change what is and there's nothing I can do about it. I have always been a prideful person with a lot of fight in me. I could never take things lying down. I have really learned a lot in the situation. Being the kind of person I was, something had to give. It's a shame I had to learn that way, but I did. My husband has really been my strength. He's very strong and understand- ing. He isn't hardened or bittered. He did all he could to help me with my tre- mendous guilt feelings.... My husband was much, much, much more accepting -very accepting, very strong, and at the same time so human. He sat down and</page><page sequence="46">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 47 cried bitterly, but at the same time accepting-not bitter, not suspicious, not angry -and that probably characterized him, probably because he has enough confi- dence in himself. He isn't afraid. And, you see, it didn't have as catastrophic an effect on him because it wasn't the end of his world. His ego was intact so that it wasn't the end of his world. He had plenty of supports. And that was where he was so lucky. Not that it doesn't hurt or that he doesn't feel it or that he's a stoic-he's really a most unique person. I have never found a person with his maturity without being defensive or prosy about it. Interviewer. The husband seemed to be quite a secure person, one who was not easily upset or who loses his effectiveness under pressure. Yet, this strength did not seem to be at the expense of tenderness and warmth. He seemed to be the steady one in the family; the wife was the more colorful.... B. Interaction with and Valuation of Children Husband. I would like them to be imaginative and stimulated to do creative things. My wife and I like to travel. We find it tremendously exhilarating. I hope they will have interests that are worthwhile. I would like both children to have some interest in the arts. Wife. ... Around 3:00, Norma comes home from school and brings a friend home or goes to another girl's house. I am really happiest when she's bringing a friend home and then they kind of hang around and dress up and act sophis- ticated . . . I just want them to be happy, all three of them. I have no ambitions and that's honestly the truth. I don't care if they're not "A" students or chosen the ones most likely to succeed. C. Division of Labor and Daily Routine at Home Husband. I am up about 6:45. Norma usually comes in while I am getting ready. We are pretty open in this house. At 7:15 Norma and I have breakfast together. My wife sleeps until later ... After dinner, I turn on the phonograph, read books to the kids, and take the kids to their baths. I spend time with the kids until they go to bed. My wife usually does the dishes-sometimes I help. Wile. I get up about 8:00 and take care of the baby. By this time, Raymond is already dressed and Norma has had breakfast with her daddy. D. Community Participation Husband. We chat after the kids get to sleep. My wife watches TV-I don't particularly care for it. I turn in about I11:00, before my wife. She comes in a little later-maybe ten minutes. She might read and be a little longer. Wife. In the morning, about 10:30, we market or go down to visit someone in the neighborhood, or someone comes here, or sometimes I stay in if I have a lot of work to do in the house. . ... (In the afternoon) the baby goes to sleep. I read a great deal and read until she wakes up around 3:00 or 3:30. Then again, we either go somewhere or somebody comes here.... Evenings during the week are terrible because we are both very active especially during certain times of the year. My husband has about two meetings a week. But I will say that we do spend more time together than most people I know-because we are usually to- gether five nights- a week. We usually spend the evening reading, and we have some TV programs we like to watch, one or two a week. I am not a great go- outer person during the week at all. Generally, the home-oriented families were characterized by the fol- lowing:</page><page sequence="47">48 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS i. In both families the husband was regarded by the wife as the stable emotional leader. The wife in the first family felt that her husband was "stoical" and "doesn't take things to heart." In the second family the wife viewed her husband as "my strength." The husbands, however, did not single out their wives as stabilizing influences. Instead, they referred to all members of the family-in one case, the kissing ritual, and, in the other, the hand-holding, mealtime ceremony. Both husbands were keenly sensitive to potential problems of mental illness especially for their wives and were attempting to counteract these problems. The husband in Family A advised against making the retarded child the "center of your life" and gave several suggestions to prevent this. The husband in Family B recommended an "open relationship" because it was "important for people to be able to discuss one's problems and work them out." The parents in Family B also traveled extensively. 2. Both families placed a high value on children. In Family A the parents came from large families and "We always wanted to have a large family of our own." The parents in Family B, in an unusual response, indi- cated that they wanted their children to "be imaginative and stimulated to do creative things" and to be mentally healthy rather than successful. 3. The specific duties in the household were not well-defined for the husband and wife. For example, in Family A the husband assumed respon- sibility for caring for the children. "The kids prefer me to care for them. They can have more fun with me-I fool around with them." His wife did typing and other office work for her husband. In Family B the husband helped with the children in the evening and sometimes assisted his wife with her tasks. 4. Community participation seemed to occur on the basis of personal interest rather than social mobility. In Family A the husband remarked, after discussing the many activities in the home, "As you see, we are not club people who are always going out." As advice to other parents, his wife suggested, "Don't isolate yourself in any way. I don't know if I'm doing that too well, but I'd advise somebody else to try." Only her neighbors and immediate family knew of the child's retardation. In Family B the wife indicated, "We spend more time together than most people I know.... I am not a great go-outer during the week at all." She did mention, how- ever, her daily contacts with neighbors and her husband's activity in formal organizations in the community. The pattern of strategies developed by the home-oriented family seemed to place the husband in the position of being the social-emotional leader of the family. The husband was oriented toward the social-emotional needs of the other family members and was devoting himself to their fulfillment. Occupational mobility was considered secondary; neither husband was "run" by his job. Nor was the primary bond in the family between the husband and wife. Here, the home-oriented family seems to deviate from the com-</page><page sequence="48">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 49 panionate family (described by Burgess and Locke), which seems to be a parent-oriented family with its stress on personal needs and interests of the parents as the primary bond. The parents in the home-oriented family seem to require a withdrawal from striving in the middle-class status system in order to devote their attention to family continuity. The home-oriented family, hence, seems to have some of the characteristics of the traditional or child-oriented family and other characteristics of the parent-oriented companionate family. NV. PARENT-ORIENTED FAMILY A A. Source of Emotional Support and Satisfaction Husband. (Occupational Career Influence): Ramona has gone to school regularly since she was two years old. She went to school in St. Paul first, then one in Baltimore, then to a school just outside Washington, and then she went to a school in upstate New York. I would like to point out that the various moves were not based on trying to find different schools for Ramona, but rather were necessitated by my work. It was after the move that we would look for a school for Ramona. .... I guess that there has been an increase in our tolerance of difficult periods. It has been a challenge and something to work toward, both a consolation and an effort to make something positive out of a negative situation. Wife. Changes in ourselves? Maybe for the good. I'm very fortunate in hav- ing a husband that accepts Ramona and helps me with her and the other children. We've been very compatible and we've shared this experience. I know I'm fortu- nate from what I've heard from other parents. Usually, it's the husband who doesn't accept the situation. . . . We're quite fortunate in these times-mental retardation is being brought out into the open-there's research, clinics, thera- pists to help us with our problems. B. Interaction with and Valuation of Children Husband. I have been making a definite effort to spend more time with Ramona. I probably spend equal time with the two older children.... We usually make some pretense of eating as a family. After supper, we have 15 minutes to one-half hour of play. The next half-hour is spent in getting the kids to bed .... (Advice to Other Parents): Most important and the advice given to us, although we didn't accept it immediately, is to have other children right away. . . . We might have had other children sooner, but that would not affect Ramona. Wife. ... Then we have dinner, which is usually quite hectic. We eat together every night, but there's spilling and the baby standing up on her high chair. But it's better all at one time--cooking two meals doesn't appeal to me. Families eating together is a good situation anyway. They are able to watch how adults do things. . ... (Advice to Other Parents): Have another child, the sooner the better. When that was suggested to me, I resented it. How was I to give Ramona the care and attention she needs? The doctor said, "I'm not thinking about Ramona; I'm thinking about you." I resented that then. Now I feel we should have had other children sooner. Interviewer. The husband tended to be apologetic about Norman's behavior, explaining that Norman wasn't used to strangers coming before his bedtime and also that Norman was curious. The husband seemed to be very proud of Norman</page><page sequence="49">50 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS and whenever a question referred to Norman, the husband's eyes seemed to light up. C. Division of Labor and Daily Routine at Home Husband. I get up some time between 6:00 and 7:00, depending upon when Ramona gets up. She is an early riser and difficult to keep in bed. I let her help me get ready for the day. She helps me shave and prepare breakfast. This is all going on while my wife is trying to get a little more sleep .... I usually dress Ramona and partly dress the other two youngsters.... Norman gets up between 7:30 and 8:00 and Norma gets a bottle, which I usually give her around 7:00. I also change Norma. It sounds like I am a slave to my kids, but I really enjoy starting my day that way .... We have breakfast between 7:45 and 8:15. Ramona and Norman are the ones who have breakfast with me. I leave about 8:15 for work.... I am home most of the time by 6:00. Of course, one day out of four or five, I travel and will be away. I spend the first half hour or hour with the kids. I might have a glass of beer or a cocktail with my wife during that time. I try to take the load off my wife during the hour between 6:00 and 7:00. I do what I can to help. I change the baby's diaper, put on Norman's shoes, etc. Wife. It's pretty rugged. We get up around 7:00 or 7:30. The most important thing is getting Ramona ready. Ramona is picked up by the school station wagon at 8:15. Then I get breakfast down Norman and keep Norma happy in her high chair. I get Norman ready for the bus at 9:00 to go to nursery school. Then I finish feeding the baby and dressing her-then the usual horrible drudgery of dishes, bed, etc.-picking up and putting away. By this time, the telephone has been going and the nursery school bus is back with Norman. Norman, Norma, and I have lunch together and then Norman has his nap. Sometimes mommy also has a nap if Norma hasn't slept too long in the morning. The bus beeps at 2:45 and Ramona is home from school. Ramona and Norman have a snack together. If the weather is nice, vwe all go outside. I cart everything out of the basement. There are TV programs from 4:30 to 5:30 that they enjoy--they are good for the children and good for me. D. Community Participation Husband. (Organization): (After mentioning activity in two formal organi- zations related to his occupation, he added:) This is a rather different picture than normally. I am relatively new in this area and would ordinarily be involved in several local organizations .... We most commonly spend the evening reading the newspapers or magazines. We also watch TV a little. Occasionally, I do some work at home, but that is not typical. We retire at 11:00 or 11:30. Wife. After the kids are in bed, we read and often my husband works at home at night. We watch TV occasionally, not a great deal. I do a lot of sewing, ironing, and washing at night. We go to bed about 12. VI. PARENT-ORIENTED FAMILY B A. Source of Emotional Support and Satisfaction Husband. My way of life has changed. I have progressed from a student, to a graduate student, to an instructor. With this, I have more time to spend with the kids. There have been no basic changes. We still handle things the same as before. Our attitude is to do what we have to and we just go on. ... (Advice to Other Parents): I'd say that they should simply do what is called for at the moment and let the future take care of itself. There is nothing particular to do. The condition is not going to change, so all you do is what is necessary. . Another point the doctor at the clinic made to me which I didn't understand</page><page sequence="50">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 51 then, but I do now is this: Make a rational choice between alternatives. You have to devote time and energy to other things as well as the child. He suggested that I never give up a future job opportunity just to remain in this area because of the good doctors here. You have to give the child his share, but not more than anyone else. . . . Recognizing that the parents have a life to lead of their own; if the child took too much, it would probably be better on the child as well as the parents if it were in an institution. Wife. I think it really bothered my husband more than me because I had actually decided that there was something wrong and he was holding off and hoping. He's gotten over it, but he has more time to think about it in the long range view and thinks it's very sad. But I think my problems are more at the moment and I don't have time to sit around and think about it. And perhaps, he has read a great many more books than I have and perhaps he has a deeper understanding of what it means than I have. We know Raymond will never be independent and will always have to be home, unless we would want to put him in an institution, which we don't. . . . You always change after you are married for a while, I guess. It isn't like the first month or so, but I can't pinpoint it in any way. I don't know that it's done anything to our marriage one way or the other. I have never really thought about it. B. Interaction with and Valuation of Children Husband. The time they each spend with me is about equal. They are both with me when one is with me-although now we try to spend separate times with each of them. They do better alone. I play ball with Raymond. We go to the park. He likes to play on the apparatus. I wrestle with them both. I take them shopping. Each night I take them to buy bread and milk and they take turns at buying the milk at the store .... When we arrive home, I play outside with the kids. We eat supper at 6:00 or 6:15. Raymond is usually through first. I take him to watch TV while we finish eating. We get in the car to get bread and milk, taking turns as to which kid goes to the store-neither wanting the other to have a turn. We come home and we start baths-one at a time. My wife usually gives them the baths. I put on the pajamas after their baths. Then we put them to bed about 8:30. . . . I pay more attention to Raymond than Norma in their play. Norma entertains herself more in her play. About this time, Norma is getting tired or she is angry at not getting enough attention from me. Wife. We were told to let him play with normal children as much as possible. But since we moved here, there really aren't any other children. (Advice to Other Parents): Try to be as nearly normal as you can; try to treat them as you would a normal child so they won't realize the great difference and the normal children won't realize the great difference. . ... I think that every one of them (retarded children) is different anyway. I have never seen any exactly like Ray- mond. So I don't think you have so much in common there. You all have a problem of similar sorts, but when it comes down to actual cases, they're just not that much alike .... I suppose if you had control over these things and maybe only have Raymond, give him all the time and not have any other children at all, it might be the thing for him. Still, I don't know-I don't know if that's true. He can go only so far no matter how many children I have or don't have .... Plans for Norma? To us, of course, she's so much different from Raymond. She's smart and bright and we expect her to go very far. If she wants to go to college, she can go. And if she wants dancing or piano lessons, she can.... We'll just give her what we can and hope that there wouldn't be anything because of Raymond that would hold her back in any way. I can't imagine that there would be.</page><page sequence="51">52 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS Interviewer. Both children were in bed although up and making a lot of noise when we arrived. The husband yelled at them a few times and went into their room a few more times. Finally, he removed Norma and she remained up for the rest of the time we were there, alternating between the two interview rooms. The impression conveyed was that there was a lack of firmness in handling the children. C. Division of Labor and Daily Routine at Home Husband. I'm not sure exactly what the kids do when they first get up be- cause I'm usually still in bed. We get up about a half hour after they do. My wife gets up around 8:00; I usually get up last. Then, everyone starts to get ready. I shave and dress. My wife usually has gotten herself ready before fixing break- fast and she takes care of dressing the kids. Then, we all get into the car and they drop me off. At about 5:30 (evening) my wife comes with the car to meet me and we all drive home. Sometimes it becomes hectic in the car. Raymond likes to jabber in the back of the car. We try to carry on a conversation with the kids on the way back. If we try any conversation unrelated to the kids, it is unsuc- cessful. Wife. (Children): On occasion they have even made breakfast for them- selves. They get out the cereal and the bowls and all sorts of things. So if we sleep too late, they won't starve. . . . Yesterday their daddy came home and we ate dinner. Then they went outside and played, with their daddy watching. He was working on the car and they were all around the building, every place dirty and muddy, and he brought them in and I had to bathe them. By the time I got all the dirt scrubbed off, it was time for putting them to bed. D. Community Participation Husband. After the kids get to sleep, I usually read the newspaper, something in connection with my work, or some light reading. My wife reads the paper, then does some housework or typing for me. Then, at 10:30 or 11:00, we quit our work. We get to bed at 1:00. Somewhere along the line, we may hold a con- versation. Often, we watch TV while doing our work. We talk about the kids or what we have to do the next day. We don't do a whole lot of talking to each other. Wife. I can imagine things would be a lot different if it weren't for Raymond. I imagine we could go more places and do more things than we do. Raymond does take time, all the time we can give him and more. Sometimes, I just don't feel like going any place, not because of any emotional strain or anything, but just caring for him physically .... One of our neighbors came in with her little girl and we had tea and cookies. This neighbor stayed until 2:30. She has a little girl 15 months old and they played with her .... (In the evening) very rarely do my husband and I sit around here doing nothing. It's usually 10:00 before the children are asleep. Then, sometimes we watch TV. That's why we don't get to bed until 1:00 or 2:00 and why we sleep late in the morning. We read the papers -that takes a good hour. I think I have terribly missed out if I don't get to read the papers. Sometimes we do get to watch some movies on TV. There's always sewing, letters to write, and typing for my husband. And then my husband always has odd jobs. Interviewer. The only comment regarding the written section which the wife made was concerning the part about the relationship with neighbors. She re- marked that she didn't feel this would truly reflect her personality because they had been living in that particular neighborhood for a few months. Her answers would have been much different in her previous neighborhood.</page><page sequence="52">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 53 In the parent-oriented families, it appears that: i. In both families the parents referred to tolerance, compatibility, sharing the experience, rational choice, the long-range view, and problems of the moment in describing their relationship. Both families were con- cerned with their life-career plans and the retarded child was interpreted in terms of its effect on these plans and the common interests of the parents. In Family A the parents placed their social mobility ahead of the child in making occupational decisions. After moving, they would seek a school for the child. In Family B the husband had decided that he would not "give up a good job opportunity just to remain in this area because of the good doctors here." Neither wife showed opposition to her husband's am- bition. 2. The wives in both families indicated some resentment toward their motherhood roles. In Family A the wife complained about the "usual hor- rible drudgery of dishes, beds, etc." and remarked that afternoon TV programs are "good for the children and for me," implying a baby-sitting function for the television set. In Family B the wife indicated that the family's social life would be fuller if it were not for the retarded child and that her "problems are more at the moment and I don't have time to sit around and think about it." She seemed to resent her husband's more sedate occupation (as she perceived it). 3. Unlike the parents in home-oriented families, parents in the parent- oriented families seemed highly ambitious for their children. All parents held the opinion that it was necessary to have normal children for the parents' sake. The interviewer of the husband in Family A remarked that "The husband seemed to be very proud of Norman and whenever a question referred to Norman, the husband's eyes seemed to light up." The mother in Family B said, "Plans for Norma? To us, of course, she's so much different from Raymond. She's smart and bright and we expect her to go very far." 4. While the husband and wife in the parent-oriented family were similar to parents in the child-oriented family in their propensity toward social mobility, attitudes and activity related to the daily routine and division of labor differed greatly. Unlike the child-oriented parents, the husband and wife in the parent-oriented family did not have a sharply defined division of labor. The husband in Family A remarked, "It sounds like I am a slave to my kids, but I really enjoy starting my day that way." In the evening, too, he tried "to take the load off" his wife. In Family B not only did the husband assist his wife, his wife also helped him in his work. 5. The proclivity of the parents toward high community participation was reflected in the statement by the husband in Family A that "I am relatively new in this area and would ordinarily be involved in several local organizations" and the comment by the wife in Family B that her rela- tionship with her neighbors reflected the family's recent move.</page><page sequence="53">54 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS In general, the parent-oriented family was characterized by a common interest between the husband and 'Wife in their success vis-a-vis middle-class standards. The parent-oriented family tended to be rational in its approach to problems. High integration in the parent-oriented family seemed to stem from a high identification of the husband with his wife, growing out of their common interests and strain toward mutual compatibility. The parent-oriented family seemed a logical consequence of the companionate (or companionship) marriage described by Burgess and Locke. INDICES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION The case material seemed to describe adequately the child-oriented, home-oriented, and parent-oriented family types hypothecated earlier. However, it would be both difficult and time-consuming to attempt to classify hundreds of families according to type if the case method were used. Hence, each case was classified on the basis of a series of specific items relating to source of emotional support, valuation of children, and community participation. The available data were too inconclusive to war- rant a classification on the basis of daily routine. Because of the correlation of daily routine and division of labor with the other attributes, it was decided that the omission of items on daily routine would not affect the results of the study appreciably. The highly integrative child-oriented family strategy was regarded as one in which: I. The propensity of both husband and wife toward social mobility was high. 2. The husband stressed instrumental rather than social-emotional (or companionate) values in his ranking of domestic values. 3. The wife was highly identified with at least one normal child. 4. Especially in families faced with unfavorable circumstances sur- rounding the retarded child, there was no evidence of a high degree of interaction between normal and retarded siblings. It was felt that especially families faced with unfavorable circumstances would find it difficult to focus consistently on the normal children's welfare if they delegated to them many responsibilities concerning the retarded child. 5. If the wife's mother was alive, the wife saw her at least once a month. 6. If the wife's mother was dead, both husband and wife were high in neighborliness. There were several reasons for choosing these characteristics to describe the child-oriented family. In the child-oriented family strategy, if only the husband were interested in social mobility, the wife would resent his being "run" by his job.. If only the wife were interested in social mobility, the husband would resent her pushing him. Similarly, if the husband were not instrumentally oriented toward his family, he would prefer to. spend</page><page sequence="54">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 55 much time at home and would not be prone to a rigidly defined division of labor. The wife's identification with at least one child would reflect contentment with her constant interaction with children. The presence of the wife's mother or of a high degree of neighborliness was meant to indicate the existence of emotional support and a high degree of integration into extra-family social arrangements. In Table 4 the criteria for classifying families in the study as child-oriented are presented. The instruments which provide the basis for classification were described in the section on Pro- cedures.

Especially in families faced with unfavorable circumstances surround- ing the retarded child, there was no evidence of a high degree of interaction between the normal and retarded siblings.</page><page sequence="55">56 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS These attributes were considered as descriptive of the home-oriented fam- ily for a variety of reasons. Failure by the husband or wife to be highly moti- vated toward social mobility in the home-oriented family strategy would per- mit the husband to devote time and attention to the other family members. His devoting time and attention to the family would also require his stress- ing social-emotional values with respect to his domestic life. Finally, emo- tional reinforcement for the home-oriented family would be obtained through a high integration of the couple into the neighborhood, or, failing that, a high degree of identification of the husband with his wife. The identification of the husband with his wife, coupled with a high valuation of social-emotional aspects of family life, would tend to facilitate a flexible division of labor in the family. The criteria used in the study for classifying families as home-oriented are shown in Table 5- TABLE 5 BASIS FOR CLASSIFICATION OF FAMILIES AS HOME-ORIENTED Instrument Used in Classification Categories or Scores Providing Criterion for Classification I.

There was a high degree of identification of the husband with his wife. In the integrative parent-oriented strategy no hypothesis was made with respect to identification with children, contact with neighbors, interaction</page><page sequence="56">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 57 between normal and retarded siblings, or interaction between the wife and her mother. These items were considered essentially conducive to child- rearing and parenthood roles and inconsequential to integrative parent- oriented activities revolving around a common interest such as movement in middle-class society. The husband's stress on social-emotional values and his identification with his wife, however, would form his commitment to the family and provide a basis for his interest in family events. In addition, high social-emotional valuation and identification with the wife would serve to prevent a rigid division of labor between husband and wife and to pro- mote a companionate relationship in marriage. In the investigation families were classified as parent-oriented on the basis of the criteria in Table 6. TABLE 6 BASIS FOR CLASSIFICATION OF FAMILIES AS PARENT-ORIENTED Instrument Used in Classification Categories or Scores Providing Criterion for Classification I. Social mobility attitude index Husband and wife each had score of 4 or over 2. Social-emotional valuation Husband's score (rho) +.Io or over 3. Identification of husband with wife Husband rated wife same as self on six or more personality traits Not all attempts at achieving a parent-oriented, child-oriented, or home- oriented family life are integrative. These attempts may lack several of the elements required for consistency in emotional support and satisfaction, community participation, valuation of children, or family division of labor. For example, in a family trying to be child-oriented, if the wife is unable to find emotional support from her own family of orientation or other per- sons especially meaningful to her, she may find the pressures of the duties of motherhood and the home too imposing. Similarly, both husband and wife may attempt to be parent-oriented, but the husband may not identify with his wife or he may not stress social-emotional domestic values; much conflict may then arise over familial versus occupational duties. Or the husband may try to be home-oriented, but his wife may not identify with any of the children and may resent her mother role; this situation, too, would result in tension in the marital relationship. Hence, only those families with all of the characteristics enumerated in the types of family strategies were regarded as integrative parent-oriented, child-oriented, or home-oriented. If the family lacked any of the required attributes, it was relegated to the residual category of "other strategies."</page><page sequence="57">58 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS TYPES OF STRATEGY AND RANKING OF DOMESTIC VALUES The 233 couples in the sample investigated were scored on the basis of the above scheme. The scoring system for each instrument appears in the Procedure section. The mere classification of these cases could not be as- sumed to reflect the differences in family strategy described. The classifi- cation could be considered meaningful only if there was a general consis- tency between the cases categorized by type of family strategy and the values which these parents stressed. For example, the families classified as parent-oriented should stress companionship; those categorized as home- oriented should emphasize home and children as well as emotional security in the family; and those families regarded as child-oriented should show high regard for traditional values such as economic security, religious unity, and healthy children. Each parent had been asked to rank a list of 10 domestic values in the order of their importance to successful family life. The list included: (a) a place in the community, (b) healthy and happy children, (c) com- panionship, (d). personality development, (e) satisfaction in affection shown, (f) economic security, (g) emotional security, (h) moral and religious unity, (i) everyday interest, and (j) a home (9). Three kinds of analyses were performed on the parents' ranking of domestic values. In the first analysis, the rankings by the parents were examined to determine whether there was greater agreement among the parents classified by integrative type than among those which were relegated to the "residual" or "other strategies" category. In the second analysis, there was an attempt to see whether the items which seemed important in the case descriptions tended to be ranked highly in the families classified according to the indices. The third analysis was made to find out whether there was more than a chance difference between the family types on specific values. Agreement on values among families classified as child-oriented, home- oriented, parent-oriented, and other strategies was indicated through the Kendall coefficient of concordance, W (27). The coefficient of concordance is a function of the degree of variance among several rankings of a given set of items, and W varies directly with the mean of the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between all pairs of rankings. The rankings of hus- bands and wives were analyzed separately. The results appear in Table 7. For all three integrative family types the coefficients of concordance were higher than those for families classified as "other strategies." The highest coefficients of concordance occurred for the child-oriented families (W = .43 for husbands, .38 for wives). For the home-oriented and parent-oriented families, the coefficients of concordance were only a little higher than those for "other strategies." For the husbands the W in home-oriented families was .24, and the W in parent-oriented families was .27 as compared with</page><page sequence="58">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 59 TABLE 7 COEFFICIENT OF CONCORDANCE ON RANKING OF DOMESTIC VALUES BY HUSBANDS AND WIVES CLASSIFIED AS CHILD-ORIENTED, HOME- ORIENTED, PARENT-ORIENTED, OR RESIDUAL STRATEGIES Family Type COEFFICIENT OF CONCORDANCE Number of Husbandsives Families Chi!d-oriented ................. ..43 .38 9 Home-oriented ................ . .24 .27 48 Parent-oriented ................. .27 .25 26 Residual strategies ............... .17 .22 "* Although I50 cases were classified as falling into the residual category of families, only 146 of these husbands and I48 wives provided rankings of domestic values with fewer than three ties in ranking. Only those individuals with fewer than three ties in ranking were used in the computation of the coefficients of concordance. a W of .17 for husbands in families classified as "other strategies." For wives in home-oriented families the W was .27, and for wives in parent- oriented families the W was .25; the W for wives in families classified as "other strategies" was .22. (Chi square tests showed that all Ws were statistically significant at the .ooI level.) While the results on agreement on rankings and family type were not wholly unequivocal, they supported the contention that there is greater agreement in the ranking of domestic values among families of a given integrative type than of families classified as "other strategies." The purpose of the second analysis was to determine whether parents who were classified as child-oriented, home-oriented, or parent-oriented tended to assign a high rank to values consistent with those classifications. The results are found in Table 8. The findings are presented in terms of the mean rank assigned. According to Table 8: i. Wives in traditional or child-oriented families tended to stress (in order) healthy and happy children, a home, and moral and religious unity. 2. Wives in home-oriented families placed highest value on healthy and happy children, companionship, and emotional security. 3. The wives in parent-oriented families seemed to stress the same values as those in home-oriented families, but the parent-oriented wives had a different order of preference--companionship, healthy and happy children, and emotional security. Hence, the wives in the child-oriented families seemed to stress the tra- ditional aims of family life; the wives in both home-oriented and parent- oriented families stressed social-emotional aspects of interaction, with the parent-oriented wife placing a greater emphasis on companionship.</page><page sequence="59">60 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS TABLE 8 MEAN RANK OF DOMESTIC VALUES FOR HUSBANDS AND WIVES BY CLASSIFICATION OF STRATEGIES AS INTEGRATIVE OR RESIDUAL* RESIDUAL INTEGRATIVE STRATEGIES STRATEGIES W I V E S H U SB A N D S WIVES HUSBANDS Child- Home- Parent- Child- Home- Parrent- Ori- Or- Ori- Ori- Ori- Ori- Domestic Values ented ented ented ented ented ented I.

As shown in Table 8, the use of the husbands' rankings in classifying families as to orientation did not eliminate the possibility of all husbands' ranking certain values high. The findings were: I. The traditional or child-oriented husbands ranked moral and religious unity highest and followed it with healthy and happy children and com- panionship, with economic security fourth. 2. The home-oriented husbands ranked a home and companionship as tied for the highest rank, closely followed by emotional security and then healthy and happy children. 3. The parent-oriented husbands, however, stressed companionship, emo- tional security, and healthy and happy children.</page><page sequence="60">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 61 Thus, the data indicated that husbands, regardless of family type, tended to rank companionship high. In addition, however, the husband in child-oriented families stressed task-oriented traditional values-moral and religious unity, children, and economic security. The home-oriented hus- bands and parent-oriented husbands both emphasized emotional security and healthy and happy children; the home-oriented husband, however, placed a home and companionship highest in their list of values, whereas the parent-oriented husband ranked only companionship highest. These results were, therefore, consistent with the characterization of the integrative family types in the case descriptions. The third analysis of the data on family values of husband and wife pertained to the differences between the integrative family types in the ranking of specific items. As shown in Table 8, the results for the wives indicated that, with minor exceptions, the mean rankings for the wives in home-oriented families were between those of the wives of child-oriented families and parent-oriented families. This finding was true for the wives' rankings on (a) healthy and happy children, (b) companionship, (c) per- sonality development, (d) satisfaction in affection shown, (e) economic security, (f) moral and religious unity, and (g) everyday interest. For the remaining three values, the mean ranking for wives in home-oriented families was lowest (e.g., largest number) in stress on a place in the com- munity and a home, and highest in emotional security. Hence, it seems that the values of wives in home-oriented families reflected an attempt to meet the personal needs of both the parents and children with high emphasis on emotional security and low emphasis on community participation. A Friedman two-way analysis of variance was computed to determine whether the differences between the wives' ratings for the three types of families were statistically significant (27). Ranks were assigned to the mean rankings for each value on the following basis: companionship, personality development, a home, emotional security, and satisfaction with affection shown were regarded as companionate or social-emotional values. The highest mean ranking for the three groups of women on a companionate value received a rank of one; the middle mean for the same value received a rank of two, and the lowest mean received a rank of three. Conversely, a place in the community, everyday interest, healthy and happy children, moral and religious unity, and economic security were regarded as instru- mental, traditional values and the lowest mean ranking for the three groups of women was ranked as one for the purpose of the Friedman test. When the difference between mean ranking on any value was less than .2, the means were regarded as equal and tied ranks were assigned. A significant difference would indicate that the three groups of women tended to vary in terms of their valuation on companionate versus insti- tutional ends of marriage.</page><page sequence="61">62 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS In the comparison between women of child-oriented, home-oriented, and parent-oriented families, the chi square obtained in the Friedman analysis of variance was 5.0. With two degrees of freedom, the probability of obtain- ing these results by chance is between .05 and .0o. Because the results were consistent with the qualitative findings, it was concluded that the three family types did differ with respect to their emphasis on companionate values. Consistent with the above interpretations of wives' rankings as stemming from three kinds of value-orientations were the findings on personality development and economic security. These two values seemed to epitomize the distinction between the traditional and companionate value systems. As shown in Table 8: I. The mean rank for the wives in child-oriented, home-oriented, and parent-oriented families on personality development was respectively 7.2, 6.I, and 5-3 (with 5-3 as the highest mean rank). A Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance test was computed for wives' ranking on personality develop- ment and was found to be significant at the .05 level (H = 6.725). 2. Similarly, the mean rank for the wives in the three family types on economic security was (in the order above) 5.8, 7.2, and 8.2, with the child-oriented wives assigning the highest mean rank to economic security. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance test was applied to the rankings on economic security and the results were significant at the .05 level (H = 6.145). Hence, although these were the only items for which there was statisti- cal significance, the results add support for the contention that the family types represent consistent value systems of the wives in these families. A comparison of the rankings by the husbands of the three family types was influenced mainly by the manner in which the families were classified. The classification of families as child-oriented depended in part on the husband's having a low score on social-emotional valuation (rho less than .io). This meant that generally he had to assign companionship, personality development, satisfaction in affection shown, emotional security, and a home a low rank in his judging of preferences in domestic life. Hence, by definition, the values of husbands in child-oriented families would differ from those of husbands in home-oriented and parent-oriented families. The important comparison of specific items in the husbands' rankings was between the home-oriented and parent-oriented families. The results were: i. The parent-oriented husbands assigned a mean rank at least .5 higher than home-oriented husbands on companionship and personality develop- ment, while the mean rank for home-oriented husbands exceeded that of parent-oriented husbands by .5 or more on economic security and a home. 2. A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test indicated that the difference in mean rank on the value of a home between the parent-oriented and home-</page><page sequence="62">TYPES OF FAMILY ORIENTATION 63 oriented husbands was significant at the .05 level (z - 1.70) in the anti- cipated direction. Home-oriented husbands' mean rank was 3.9; parent- oriented husbands' mean rank was 5-3. As only one significant difference in Io comparisons, the findings on valuation of a home would lend little support to the contention that the value systems differ. In combination with the other evidence on com- panionate versus institutional values, however, the results appear more conclusive. Hence, for the husbands as well as the wives, the data on rank- ing of domestic values support the classification of families as child-oriented, home-oriented, and parent-oriented integrative family types. SUMMARY In this section three kinds of family orientation were presented as strate- gies for counteracting possible disintegrative effects of a retarded child on his parents' marriage. These three integrative types of family orientation- child-oriented, home-oriented, and parent-oriented-were regarded as strate- gies for maintaining integrated (respectively) traditional, domestic, and companionate family organization. Empirical cumulative support for these types was found through case material and an examination of domestic values of families classified as child-oriented, home-oriented, or parent- oriented. It was found that (a) there tends to be more agreement on value rankings of both husbands and wives within each of these classifications than on rankings of persons classified as "other strategies," (b) the husbands and wives tend to stress values descriptive of the family types, and (c) on specific values the individuals classified in a given family type differ in their ranking of those values from individuals in the other two integrative family types in the direction anticipated on the basis of the typology.</page><page sequence="63">MARITAL INTEGRATION AND FAMILY ORIENTATIONS In the last section three types of putatively integrative family orienta- tions were described. The purpose of this section is to present the results of an analysis of data relating these integrative family orientations to the marital integration of the parents of severely mentally retarded children. In the first analysis the marital integration scores of parents who utilized the family orientations regarded putatively as integrative were compared with the integration scores of the other parents in the study. In a second analysis, in combination with types of orientation, the marital integration scores of parents who kept their retarded child at home were compared with the integration scores of parents who placed their child in an institution. A third analysis determined whether the combination of an integrative orientation and the move of institutionalizing the child had a more bene- ficial effect on the parents' marital integration than merely utilizing the integrative orientation. As part of the third analysis, an attempt was made to find out whether differences in marital integration were related to any single strategy (e.g., a consistent child orientation). By implication, the orientations are strategies by which the family mem- bers can act together effectively in the face of difficulty. As described in the last section, these integrative strategies were (a) the child-oriented family, (b) the home-oriented family, and (c) parent-oriented family. All other families were placed in a residual category of orientations. The definition of marital integration as (a) the consensus of husband and wife on domestic values and (b) the effective coordination of domestic roles assumes a consistency between means and ends. It implies a clear-cut focus on a single aspect or aim of family life. The strategies described above (child-oriented, home-oriented, or parent-oriented) are regarded as the consistent organization of family activities aimed at the achievement of gratification in a given aspect of family life. Hence, the development of consistent strategies should be associated empirically with high marital integration. In the analysis the favorableness of circumstances surrounding the re- tarded child was taken into account. There were three classifications of cir- cumstance-favorable, unpredictable, and unfavorable. These classifications had been derived on the basis of social status of the parent, sex of the re- tarded child, religion, and birth order of the child. The classification of circumstances was discussed in the section on Favorableness of Circum- stances Concerning Retarded Child. 64</page><page sequence="64">MARITAL INTEGRATION 65 USE OF INTEGRATIVE ORIENTATIONS The relationship between the use of internally-consistent orientation strategies and marital integration was first analyzed for all families. Of the 233 families included in the study, 83 sets of parents used strategies which were classified as integrative. The distribution of specific integrative strategies is shown in Table 9. TABLE 9 MARITAL INTEGRATION AND THE USE OF SPECIFIC INTEGRATIVE STRATEGIES BY PARENTS IN 83 FAMILIES WITH A MENTALLY RETARDED CHILD, BY FAVORABLENESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE RETARDED CHILD INTEGRATIVE STRATEGY Child-Oriented Parent-Oriented Home-Oriented T o T A L Circumstances N Mean* N Mean* N Mean * N Mean Favorable ......... 6 5.50 9 4.89 I6 4.19 31 4.65 Unpredictable ...... 2 5.50 9 3.56 25 3.80 36 3.83 Unfavorable .......

According to Table 9, the mean marital integration score for families using the putatively integrative strategies was 4.x7. The number of cases in each cell of Table 9 is too small to discuss the relative effectiveness of any specific strategy under any given circumstance reliably. Apparently, the child-oriented strategy provided the highest mean marital integration scores for both favorable and unpredictable circumstances. The mean marital integration score for all nine families utilizing child-oriented integrative strategies was 5-33. For the total 26 families using parent-oriented integrative strategies, the mean marital integration score was 4.27. The mean marital integration score for the 48 families utilizing home-oriented integrative strategies was 3.90o. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was computed to determine whether these differences in marital integration could be attributed to chance. The H obtained in this test was 6.884, which is sig- nificant at the .05 level. Hence, in terms of the least risk in obtaining a low marital integration score, the child-oriented strategies seemed the most efficient. The parent-oriented and home-oriented integrative strategies were less efficient.</page><page sequence="65">66 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS When the marital integration scores of parents who used the hypothe- cated strategies were compared with those of other parents, the parents who utilized integrative strategies were found to have a higher marital integra- tion than parents who did not. The results are shown in Table io. Parents who used integrative strategies had a mean marital integration score of 4.17- For the 150 families in the residual category, the mean marital integration score was 3.13. The Mann-Whitney U one-tailed test was significant at the .00003 level (z = 4-79). A comparison of each integrative strategy with the residual category also showed significant differences. (Home-oriented, z = 2.83, P = .002; parent-oriented, z = 3-70, p = .000o; child-oriented, z = 3.02, p =--.oo.)

Generally, as shown in Table Io, the difference in marital integration between parents who used integrative strategies and those who did not was greatest for families faced with unfavorable circumstances concerning the retarded child. The results were: i. For families in favorable circumstances, the 31 couples who used integrative strategies had a mean marital integration score of 4.65 while the 40 other couples had a mean marital integration of 3.88. The results of the one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test were statistically significant (z --2.52; p .006). 2. For families faced with unpredictable circumstances, the 36 sets of parents who used integrative strategies had a mean marital integration score of 3.83 and the other 64 couples had a mean marital integration score of 3-27. These results were significant at the .04 level (z = 1.81).</page><page sequence="66">MARITAL INTEGRATION 67 3. Of the families faced with unfavorable circumstances, the 16 married couples using integrative strategies had a mean marital integration of 4.00 whereas the 46 couples in the residual category had a mean marital inte- gration of 2.30. For families faced with unfavorable circumstances, the results were statistically significant at the .oooi level (z = 3.70). From these findings it appears that, regardless of the potential unfavor- able consequences of circumstances concerning the retarded child, the use of the putatively integrative orientations is important to integration in fami- lies with retarded children.

Mean marital integration scores of parents with a child in an institution and those with a retarded child at home as classified by the favorableness of circumstances surrounding the retarded child are shown in Table 11. For any set of circumstances or for all cases, the Mann-Whitney U two-tailed test showed no significant difference between parents with an institutional- ized child and those with a child at home. These results indicate that insti- tutionalization of the child does not in itself provide a solution for family problems, but merely may remove one impediment to this solution. It was anticipated, however, that, within the samples of families with a retarded child in an institution and those with a retarded child at home, parents who use the integrative strategies would tend to have a higher</page><page sequence="67">68 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS marital integration score than those who use other strategies. It was also expected that placing the child in an institution would enable the family to lead a more "normal" life and therefore would provide a situation con- ducive to effective use of integrative strategies. That is, the results on the use of integrative strategies should be more pronounced among families with a retarded child in an institution than among families with a retarded child at home. The results on the relationship between marital integration and the use of integrative strategies by parents of retarded children in an institution are shown in Table 12. For each level of favorableness of circumstance, parents who used integrative strategies had higher marital integration scores than those who used other strategies.

Of these families the nine sets of parents who used integrative strategies had a mean marital integration score of 4.67, and the io in the residual category had a mean of 3.50 (one-tailed Mann- Whitney U = 23; at the .05 level, U = 24). 2. Of the 31 families faced with unpredictable circumstances, iii couples who used integrative strategies had a mean marital integration score of 4.27, while the 20 other couples had a mean of 3-35 (U = 72; at .05 level, U = 69). 3. Of the 15 families faced with unfavorable circumstances, the six couples who used integrative strategies had a mean marital integration score</page><page sequence="68">MARITAL INTEGRATION 69 of 4.83, and the remaining nine families had a mean of 1.89 (U = 2; at .ooi level, U = 2). 4. For all families with a child in an institution, the 26 sets of parents who utilized integrative strategies had a mean marital integration score of 4.54, and the 39 other families had a mean marital integration score of 3.05 (one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test; z = 3.70; p = .o000oo). Hence, in families with a child in an institution, except for parents faced with unpredictable circumstances, the results were statistically significant in the direction anticipated. Although the number of cases is small, the results indicate that parents with a child in an institution who utilize integrative strategies tend to have a higher marital integration than parents in the residual category. The results on marital integration and the use of integrative strategies by parents with retarded children at home are shown in Table 13.

Also in the anticipated direction were the findings for families faced with unfavorable circumstances. For these families the mean marital inte- gration of couples with integrative orientations was 3.50 (io families) while the mean score for parents in the residual category was 2.41 (37 families). On the basis of a one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, the results were statis- tically significant at the .02 level (z = 2.15). 4. For all families with a retarded child at home, regardless of circum- stances, couples characterized by an integrative orientation tended to have a higher marital integration score than the other parents. The mean marital integration of parents with an integrative orientation was 4.00 (57 families), and the mean score for the remaining couples was 3.16 (i i families). The one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was significant at the .ooi level (z = 3.24). Hence, the statistical analysis supported the contention that, regardless of favorableness of circumstance or whether the retarded child was at home or in an institution, couples utilizing an orientation imputed in this study to be integrative tend to have a higher marital integration than other couples. Institutionalization Combined with Consistent Orientation A third problem in the analysis was whether the combination of insti- tutionalization and the use of an integrative family orientation was more effective than the use of integrative orientations when the retarded child is at home. Results reported in the earlier monograph by Farber (io) on effects of a retarded child on family integration suggest: (a) parents of retarded boys (but not parents of girls) apparently were helped in their marital integration by institutionalizing the child; (b) the marital integra- tion of Catholic parents of retarded boys was not appreciably increased by placing the boy in an institution. These findings suggest that the combina- tion of institutionalization and integrative orientation is especially effective in counteracting disruptive influences of the retarded child on his parents' marriage when circumstances concerning the retarded child are unfavorable. The results on the residence of the child as related to the marital inte- gration of parents who utilize integrative orientations appear in Table 14. The findings in Table 14 are consistent with those in the first phase of the analysis: i. For families faced with favorable circumstances, there was little dif- ference in the marital integration of parents with a retarded child at home (mean score = 4.64) and those with a retarded child in an institution (mean score = 4.67). 2. For families with unpredictable circumstances, the marital integration of parents with a child in an institution was 4.27, which was somewhat</page><page sequence="70">MARITAL INTEGRATION 71 TABLE 14 MARITAL INTEGRATION AND THE RESIDENCE OF THE RETARDED CHILD FOR PARENTS USING INTEGRATIVE STRATEGIES (Circumnstances RETARDED CHILD IN INSTITUTION No. of Mean Marital Cases Integration RETARDED CHILD AT HOME No. of fMean Marital Cases Integration Favorable ............... 9 4.67 22 4.64 Unpredictable ............ i i 4.27 25 3.64 Unfavorable ............. 6 4.83 10 3.50 All cases ................ - 26 4.54 57 4.00 higher than that of parents with a retarded child at home, 3.64. The differ- ence, however, was not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test; z = .82). 3. For families faced with unfavorable circumstances, however, the difference in mean marital integration between parents with a retarded child in an institution and parents with a retarded child at home was consider- able. The mean marital integration score of parents with a retarded child in an institution was 4.83 while the mean score for parents with a retarded child at home was 3.50. Despite the very small number of families faced with unfavorable circumstances who used integrative orientations (16 fam- ilies), the results were only slightly above those required for statistical sig- nificance. On the one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, a U of 14 was required for significance at the .05 level; the U obtained was 14.5- The results on institutionalization suggested that, especially for families faced with relatively unfavorable circumstances surrounding the retarded child, the combination of institutionalization and the use of integrative orientations seemed effective in counteracting disruptive effects of the re- tarded child on the marital integration of his parents. In contrast to the above results on families utilizing integrative orienta- tions, when the families in the residual category were analyzed (see Tables 12 and 13), there were no consistent differences in marital integration between families with a retarded child at home and those with a child in an institution. An additional analysis was made to determine whether the differences in marital integration between families with a retarded child at home and those with a child in an institution could be attributed to only one kind of strategy. The results are found in Table x5. The findings support the view that the consistent child-oriented, home-oriented, and parent-oriented strate- gies are each integrative to the parents' marriage:</page><page sequence="71">72 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS i. The mean marital integration score of the two child-oriented families with a retarded child in an institution was 6.oo as compared with 5.14 for the seven child-oriented families with a retarded child at home. 2. The seven parent-oriented families with a child in an institution had a mean marital integration score of 4.57 while the 19 parent-oriented families with a retarded child at home had a mean integration score of 4.16. 3. Similarly, the 17 home-oriented families with a child in an institution had a mean marital integration of 4.35 whereas the 31 home-oriented families with a retarded child at home had a mean integration score of 3.65- Because of the small number of cases utilizing each strategy, it was not anticipated that the results would achieve statistical significance. For fami- lies utilizing integrative orientations, the results suggested, however, regard- less of which integrative orientation was used, the mean marital integration score of parents with a child in an institution tends to be higher than that of parents with a retarded child at home.

Are the three kinds of family orientation imputed to be integrative actually associated with high marital integration of parents of retarded children? 2. Is the combination of integrative family orientations and institution- alization more effective in attaining or maintaining high marital integra- tion than either (a) using integrative family orientations and keeping the child at home or (b) not using integrative orientations and placing the child in an institution? Whether the child was at home or in an institution, parents who utilized one of the three integrative family orientations tended to have a higher</page><page sequence="72">MARITAL INTEGRATION 73 marital integration than those who did not. For the sample studied, espe- cially those parents faced with less favorable circumstances concerning the retarded child seemed to benefit from the combination of placing the re- tarded child in an institution and utilizing integrative strategies. These re- sults based on relatively small samples, however, should be regarded as highly tentative.</page><page sequence="73">IDIOSYNCRATIC STRATEGIES In previous sections three family orientations were presented and evalu- ated. The evaluation was made in terms of the consequences of these orien- tations for the marital integration of parents of retarded children. Of the total sample of 233 families, 83 families utilized one of these orientations or strategies. Thus, the remaining o50 families were placed in a residual category. The purpose of this section is to describe and evaluate effective- ness of some strategies being pursued by the 150 families in the residual category. In one sense each of the 150 families in the residual category was pur- suing an idiosyncratic strategy. In the discussion of the game-of-strategy model, these strategies were regarded as "unique" only in the sense that they were not anticipated in the rules of the game as integrative family ori- entations. Insofar as these unanticipated orientations produced high marital integration on the average, they were considered as "cheating." Identifica- tion of such unique strategies would serve to introduce further order into the data and would suggest revision of conceptual schemes in future research concerning family orientation in a crisis situation. The general procedure followed was to re-examine the strategies used by the 150 families in the residual category with a view to grouping to- gether those families which had one or more moves in common. For example, xo families might be found wherein both husband and wife stressed instrumental rather than companionate values with respect to family life, where both husband and wife had high scores on the neighborliness scale, and where both were oriented toward high social mobility according to the social mobility scale employed in this study. Or several families might be grouped together on the basis of similarity with respect to only one move such as having only one child (i.e., the retarded child is the only child in the family). Once the families had been grouped on the basis of similarity of moves, the next step was to determine the mean marital integration score for each of the groupings. Where the mean marital integration score for the families utilizing a tentative strategy was either very high or very low, it was as- sumed that either an integrative or a disruptive strategy was being pursued, and an attempt was made to provide an explanation as to why the strategy should effect marital integration in the way that it did. Where the mean marital integration score for families utilizing similar moves was neither markedly high or low, no attempt was made to define the set of moves as a strategy. 74</page><page sequence="74">IDIOSYNCRATIC STRATEGIES 75 In the analysis two additional strategies which seemed to affect marital integration in a consistent way were isolated. These strategies are discussed below. The Only-Child Strategy Of I1 x families with a retarded child at home in the residual category of family orientations, there were 25 families in which the retarded child was the only child in the family. Seven of these 25 families were faced with favorable circumstances surrounding the retarded child, 11 were faced with unpredictable circumstances, and the remaining seven, with unfavorable circumstances. The seven one-child families who were facing favorable circumstances had a mean marital integration score of 5-43 (with no couple having an inte- gration score of less than 4.00). On the other hand, the seven families facing unfavorable circumstances had a mean integration score of 1.71 (with no couple attaining a score of more than 3.00). The i i families facing unpre- dictable circumstances attained a mean marital integration score of 3.x8, which was close to the mean score for all parents with a retarded child at home. Thus, it appeared that having an only child was conducive to high marital integration for parents faced with favorable circumstances but dis- ruptive for those parents faced with unfavorable circumstances. The only-child strategy can be contrasted with the three integrative orientations (child-oriented, parent-oriented, home-oriented) which form the core of this monograph. The three integrative strategies were all classi- fied as being both general and integrative strategies. That is, it was assumed that pursuance of any one of the three orientations tends to maximize the marital integration of the couple under all circumstances whether favorable, unfavorable, or unpredictable. Having-an-only-child seems to fall into the category of a specific move. Here, a specific strategy is defined as one which is either integrative or disruptive in terms of marital integration only under certain circumstances. The only-child strategy, however, not only varies in effectiveness with specific circumstances surrounding the retarded child, but also shifts from disruptive to integrative with change in circumstances. Thus, under favor- able circumstances, the only-child strategy seems to maximize marital integration while, under unfavorable circumstances, it tends to minimize marital integration. An interpretation of the finding pertaining to having only one child is that the parents may consistently orient their lives around the needs of the child. Each decision is made with the welfare of the child in mind. If the circumstances surrounding the child are not highly frustrating (i.e., favor- able circumstances), this focus on the child's needs would form the basis for the parents' developing common values and effectively coordinating their family roles. If circumstances are continually frustrating and disheartening</page><page sequence="75">76 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS (i.e., unfavorable circumstances), however, with their deep involvement in the child's needs, the parents have no respite from the tragic situation. Much tension may then develop in the system of family roles and the parents may come to disagree on values. In families with an "only" mentally retarded child, the parents do not seem to be child-oriented in the traditional sense. They are merely concerned with the welfare of their retarded child and not with family continuity. Often, they choose not to have more children. Hence, the parents' centering their lives around an only child who is severely mentally retarded can be regarded as a distinct strategy. Depending upon the favorableness of cir- cumstances, this strategy may be integrative or disruptive to the parents' marriage. Compensated Child-Oriented Strategy Four families were found who adhered to the following pattern of attributes: (a) both the husband and wife had high scores (a score of 4 or more) on the social mobility scale; (b) the husband stressed instrumental rather than companionate values in family life; (c) both the husband and wife had high scores (scores of 9 or more) on the neighborliness scale. All of the families were faced with unpredictable circumstances surrounding the retarded child and in all families the retarded child was at home. The mean marital integration score for these four families was 4.00, which suggests that the strategy being pursued by these families was favorable in terms of marital integration. Except for one element, the strategy described above is similar to the child-oriented strategy described earlier in the monograph. The difference between the two strategies is that in none of the four families pursuing the "unique" strategy did the mother identify highly with a normal child. Be- cause of this lack of identification, these families had not been included in the child-oriented category. It was contended that the failure of the wife to identify with normal children indicated a possible lack of satisfaction on the part of the wife with her role as mother. The problem is basically one of explaining why, in these four families, the apparent lack of satisfaction of the wife with her role as a mother was not disruptive to her marital relationship (cf. 9). An inspection of case material pertaining to these families revealed the following information: i. In Family A the mother was employed for five hours a day in a clerical job outside of the home. In this situation the mother's outside inter- est may have ameliorated her dissatisfaction with her role as a mother. 2. In Family B, where there were four normal children, there was a full-time servant in the home to aid mother in her household duties. The move of having a servant would tend to offset the mother's apparent dissatis- faction with her role as a mother.</page><page sequence="76">IDIOSYNCRATIC STRATEGIES 77 3. In the two remaining families the evidence was not clear-cut. In Family C the "normal child" was an adult male of 20 years of age who was actually a nephew to the husband and wife but who had been living in the home for the past 15 years. Since the "normal child" in this case was actually an adult who required little in the way of care, the failure of the wife to identify highly with him seems unimportant. Perhaps, this case more prop- erly belongs in the only-child strategy category. In Family D, although the marital integration score of the couple was relatively high (a score of 4), the major contribution to this score was the husband's very favorable per- sonality trait ratings for himself and his wife. In this case the husband spent a good deal of his time traveling on the job. Previous experience with the index of marital integration has shown that, when the husband usually spends much of his time on trips away from home (e.g., railroad, traveling salesman), his contribution to the total trait rating score for himself and his wife may be disproportionately high. The implication here is that the marital integration score for Family D may have been spuriously high. In each of the families classified as compensated child-oriented, specific moves had been improvised to counteract potential tensions in the family system. If these moves were to become widespread, specific hypotheses pertaining to their effects on marital integration could be developed. SUIMMARY Two strategies have been presented and discussed briefly-the only-child strategy and the compensated child-oriented strategy. The only-child strategy suggests the presence of an orientation which is specific, not only in the sense that it tends to maximize marital integration only under certain cir- cumstances, but also that it appears to be disruptive under other circum- stances. The compensated child-oriented strategy, on the other hand, points up the effectiveness of improvised moves by parents in counteracting what would ordinarily be a disintegrative strategy.</page><page sequence="77">INTERACTION BETWEEN SEVERELY MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN AND THEIR NORMAL SIBLINGS In the introduction family activity in a crisis was regarded as participa- tion in a game of strategy against Nature. It was suggested that effects on normal children be considered as a secondary criterion (or side-bet) in evaluating ways of handling the retarded child. In this section patterns of interaction between a retarded child living at home and his normal brothers and sisters will be evaluated. The focus of interest will be upon (a) the progression of family roles in relation to a retarded sibling assumed by the normal child as he grows older and (b) the relationship between role tension of the normal sibling and the fre- quency with which he interacts with the retarded child. The conceptual scheme employed in the analysis and interpretation of the data is that, in inducing arrest in the family cycle, the retarded child changes patterns of interaction between his normal siblings and himself. In general, the age, sex, and birth order of all the children are regarded as independent variables which influence the frequency and the nature of the interaction between the retarded child and his normal siblings. According to the conceptual scheme, regardless of his birth order in the family, the severely mentally retarded child progressively becomes the youngest child in a social sense. As the normal children develop roles appropriate to their age and sex, the mentally retarded child by contrast changes slowly and thereby tends toward the status of a younger sibling. This process should occur regardless of the relative birth order of the retarded child and the normal sibling who is taken as the point of reference (io). PROGRESSION OF ROLES If the statement that the retarded child tends progressively to become the youngest child in the family socially is accurate, it would be expected that, when a retarded child is young, interaction between normal and re- tarded children of approximately the same age would be on a basis of equality with regard to status. As the children grow older, however, the normal sibling would tend to become more and more protective and initiat- ing of activity and would tend toward the superordinate position in the relationship. The hypothesis tested was: For normal siblings of either sex who are approximately the same age as the retarded child, a greater proportion of siblings of an older retarded child will assume a superordinate role than will siblings of a young retarded child. 78</page><page sequence="78">INTERACTION WITH SIBLINGS 79 This hypothesis was tested in the following two ways: (a) for normal brothers and sisters separately and (b) for the normal sibling nearest to the retarded child in age, regardless of sex. The data used were the mother's descriptions of the patterns of inter- action between normal siblings and the retarded child. The mother's descrip- tions were divided into three categories according to the nature of the inter- action: (a) Normal child interacts with the retarded child on an equal status basis or the retarded child is superordinate. (The mother reported the retarded child as being superordinate in only three cases.) (b) The sub- ordination of the retarded child to the normal child was not clear. (c) The normal child held the superordinate status in the relationship with the retarded child. The sample of normal siblings used in this test of the hypothesis had to meet the following requirements in order to be included: (a) Each normal sibling had to be either one to four years younger or one to four years older than the retarded child. (b) No normal sibling less than three years of age was included. (c) In the event that there were two normal siblings of different sex in the same family, both were included provided that the younger of the normal siblings was three years of age or older. (d) If, however, there were two normal siblings of the same sex, only the one nearest in age to the retarded child was included. In this case, if the normal siblings were an equal distance in age from the retarded child (for example, one normal brother, two years younger, and the other, two years older than the retarded child) the normal sibling to be included was selected by the flip of a coin. The criteria for sample selection outlined above were applied to a sample of 129 normal siblings from 1o3 families with a retarded child living at home. This procedure resulted in a sample of 78 normal siblings who met the criteria and who, in addition, fell into one of the three interaction categories indicated earlier. Of the 78 normal siblings in the test sample, 41 were sisters of a retarded child and 37 were brothers of a retarded child. The normal brothers and sisters were split into two groups, those with a young retarded sibling, i.e., below the median chronological age for re- tarded children in the sample (seven years of age or younger), and those with a retarded sibling above the median chronological age (eight years of age or older). The results for the first test of the hypothesis are shown in Table 16. The normal sisters of a young retarded sibling participated with that sibling on an equal basis in so of the 19 families and were superordinate in only one family. On the other hand, of the 22 sisters with an older retarded sibling, only four participated with that sibling on an equal basis and nine were in a superordinate position. A chi square computed for this portion of the table was found to be statistically significant at the .o2 level (chi square = 8.737, df = 2). No attempt was made to compute a chi square</page><page sequence="79">80 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS for normal brothers because of the small number of cases in the "normal child superordinate" category. However, it may be noted that while only 34 per cent of the normal sisters were in the "equal participation" category (14 out of 41 siblings), 51 per cent of the normal brothers were in this category (19 out of 37 siblings). This suggests a difference in the surrogate roles of normal brothers as opposed to normal sisters.

The hypothesis dealing with the progression of roles of the normal sibling was also tested using only the normal sibling in each family who was nearest to the retarded child in age, regardless of sex. The mother's responses to questions concerning the nature and frequency of interaction between the normal siblings and the retarded child were again used in the test of the hypothesis. The criteria used for selecting the sample were the same as those for selecting the sample of normal brothers and sisters above with the following exceptions: (a) Only one normal sibling from each family could be taken as the normal sibling of reference. (b) The normal sibling to be included in this analysis was chosen on the basis of proximity to the retarded child in age, regardless of the sex of the normal sibling. (c) If there were two normal siblings in the family who were an equal distance from the retarded child in age, then the sibling to be included was selected by the flip of a coin. Application of the criteria for sample selection outlined above resulted in a sample of 69 normal siblings. Of these, 35 were normal brothers or sisters of a retarded child who was seven years of age or younger, while 34 were the normal siblings of a retarded childed who was eight years of age or older. The results for the second test of this hypothesis are shown in Table 17. Of the 35 siblings of a younger retarded child, 22 participated with him</page><page sequence="80">INTERACTION WITH SIBLINGS 81 on an equal basis, while of the 34 siblings of an older retarded child, only eight participated with him on an equal basis. On the other hand, just four normal siblings were superordinate in their relationship to the younger re- traded child, while nine normal siblings were superordinate in their rela- tionship to the older retarded child. A chi square computed for this table was found to be statistically significant at the .oI level (chi square = 10.960, df = 2).

The results of the two tests of the first hypothesis generally support the contention that a retarded child continually tends to become the youngest child in the family socially. The findings were more conclusive with respect to normal sisters of a retarded child than with respect to normal brothers. The difference in family roles of normal brothers and sisters would account for the greater stress which is laid upon the sister's surrogate role. EFFECTS OF INTERACTION ON NORMAL SIBLINGS With respect to the problem of the relationship between role tension of normal siblings and their frequency of interaction with the retarded child, it has been noted that the normal sibling who interacts with the retarded child must continually re-define his role as he grows older (io). It is sug- gested that the need to shift roles tends to generate anxiety, frustration, and conflict for the sibling involved (cf. 3 on "oldest child role"). In such a situation it seems plausible that the normal child does not fully conform to the role expectations of the parents. Probably, the greater the anxiety and frustration generated by the interaction demands made with respect to the retarded child, the greater is the tension generated in the mother-father- child triad as a system of roles. (For a discussion of the family as a series of triads, see io.) In this discussion this tension (or lack of effective role co- ordination in the mother-father-child triadic relationship with the normal child as the point of reference) will be called the child's role tension.</page><page sequence="81">82 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS The hypothesis tested was: Normal children who interact frequently with their retarded sibling tend to have higher role tension than those children who engage in little or no interaction with their retarded sibling. The normal brothers and sisters were divided into two subgroups: (a) those siblings for which the mother gave evidence of frequent interaction with the retarded child, i.e., the same siblings as were used in Table 16, and (b) those normal siblings for which there was no evidence of frequent interaction with the retarded child given by the mother. There were four categories of little or no interaction between a retarded child and the normal siblings of reference based on evidence given by the mother. These categories were as follows: (a) mother explicitly stated that little or no interaction took place between the normal sibling and the re- tarded child, (b) mother indicated that the normal sibling was not living at home, (c) mother lumped all of the normal siblings together in her response so that it was impossible to determine the frequency of interaction of any one normal sibling with the retarded child, and (d) mother failed to answer the appropriate questions. The last two categories above provided no direct or positive evidence regarding the nature or frequency of interaction between a specific normal sibling and the retarded child. However, the elimination of these two cate- gories resulted in too few cases in the little or no interaction half of the dichotomy to justify statistical analysis. In order to overcome this difficulty, the assumption was made that if there were frequent interaction between normal and retarded siblings, the mother always indicated this fact in her response. Thus, this limitation in the data must be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. As described in the section of Procedure, the index of role tension for each normal sibling was the mother's rating of that sibling on the basis of ro undesirable personality traits. On the basis of these ratings, each child could receive a score ranging from a --20 to a +20 with a low (negative) score indicating high role tension and a high (positive) score indicating low role tension. The sample of normal siblings used in this portion of the analysis in- cluded those in Table i6 in addition to the siblings who had little or no interaction with the retarded child. A sample of Io9 normal siblings was obtained. Of this number, 55 were sisters of a retarded child and 54 were brothers. There were 41 normal sisters who were classified as interacting fre- quently with the retarded child and 14 sisters for whom there was no evi- dence of frequent interaction. Similarly, there were 37 normal brothers for whom there was evidence of frequent interaction and 17 brothers who were classified as having little or no interaction with the retarded sibling.</page><page sequence="82">INTERACTION WITH SIBLINGS 83 Separate analyses of the relationship between role tension and frequency of interaction with a retarded sibling were made for normal brothers and normal sisters. For example, the role tension score for each sister was re- corded and then ranked with the high (positive) scores receiving the top- most ranks. The ranks for normal sisters who were classified as interacting frequently with a retarded sibling were compared with the ranks for those normal sisters classified as having little or no interaction with the retarded child. The data were then submitted to a Mann-Whitney U test of the sig- nificance of the difference between the ranks of the two subgroups on role tension. The same procedure was followed for the normal brothers of a retarded sibling. The results for normal sisters were in the anticipated direction. The normal sisters who interacted frequently with the retarded child had higher role tension (mean role tension score = 3.29) than those normal sisters who had little or no interaction with the retarded child (mean role tension score = 7.86). The results were statistically significant at the .oi level (z -= 2.28). The results for normal brothers were not conclusive. The 37 normal brothers who interacted frequently with the retarded sibling attained a mean role tension score of 6.95; the 17 normal brothers classified as having little or no interaction with the retarded child attained a mean role tension score of 6.18. The mean role tension of normal brothers who interacted frequently with their retarded sibling, thus, was almost the same as that of brothers who did not. The results were not statistically significant (p = .44; z = .4). Taken as a whole, the results suggest that: x. There exist differences in family roles (e.g., norms, responsibility) between normal brothers and normal sisters of retarded children. 2. Harmful effects on the sister's personal adjustment may result from her assuming much responsibility in caring for the child. SUMMARY The study of interaction between normal children and their retarded sibling dealt with two problems: i. What are the patterns of interaction that occur between mentally retarded children and their normal brothers and sisters'and how do these patterns change as chronological age increases? 2. What effect does frequent interaction with a retarded sibling have upon the behavior of the normal sibling as perceived by the mother? To examine the progression of the family roles of the normal child in relation to his retarded sibling, parents' verbatim responses to questions</page><page sequence="83">84 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS regarding the nature and frequency of interaction between the retarded child and his normal siblings were analyzed. The analysis indicated that: i. When the retarded child is young, interaction between normal and retarded children of approximately the same age tends to be on an equali- tarian or playmate basis. As the children grow older, the normal sibling (especially a sister) tends to assume a superordinate position in the rela- tionship. 2. Normal girls who interact frequently with their retarded sibling tend to be involved in family role relationships more tense than those of girls who engage in little or no interaction with the retarded child. In general, the contention that the retarded child progressively moves toward the status of the youngest child in the family was supported by the data. The results also suggested that this process of relative regression by the retarded child has special implications for the mental health of normal sisters. The use of open-ended responses as a basis for the analysis, however, requires that the findings be regarded as highly tentative, requiring repli- cation of the research with instruments designed specifically to study inter- action between normal and retarded siblings.</page><page sequence="84">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The aim of the research was to investigate various ways that families organize themselves to counteract the disintegrative effects of having a severely mentally retarded child. SAMPLE The sample consisted of 233 families living in the Chicago area in which both husband and wife were interviewed. The parents were (a) Caucasian, (b) predominantly middle-class, (c) married and living together at the time of the study, and (d) had been in contact with a parents' association for promoting the welfare of the mentally retarded. The mentally retarded children were (a) aged 16 or under, (b) born in the present marriage, and (c) predominantly of the "trainable" classification. PROCEDURE In the collection of data two interviewers visited each family in their home at an appointed time. While one interviewer talked with the husband, the other interviewed the wife. The interview, which lasted about two and one-half hours, consisted of two parts. The first section was an oral interview in which the parents were asked to elaborate on various matters pertaining to the family and the child's handicap. Interviewers recorded the responses verbatim. The second section of the interview consisted of a questionnaire which was completed in the presence of the interviewer. This section included an index of marital integration, a sibling role-tension index, a social mobility scale, and a neighborliness scale in addition to questions on parents, friends, and basic social data. In the analysis of the quantitative data statistical techniques utilizing nonparametric assumptions were applied. The .05 probability of chance occurrence was used as the basis for accepting or rejecting hypotheses. DIscussioN The research centered around the following questions: I. What are the conditions or 'circumstances which influence the poten- tial severity of the disintegrative effects of the retarded child on the family ? 85</page><page sequence="85">86 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS 2. What are the effective courses of action which the family may take in order to maintain its integrity? 3. As specific courses of action, (a) Is it necessary to place the retarded child in an institution? (b) How does the relationship between normal and retarded siblings affect the personal adjustment of the normal siblings? The Conceptual Model To organize the data in a way which would relate the various questions, a conceptual model was developed. The basis for the model was the von Neumann and Morgenstern theory of games of strategy (24). The analogy regarded the family as being involved in a game of strategy against Nature. The range of Nature's strategies was indicated by the degree of severity with which specific conditions potentially affected family integration. Cer- tain kinds of family organization which could potentially counteract the strategies of Nature were regarded putatively as integrative family strategies. The major pay-off or reward for the family was the degree of marital inte- gration at the time of the study. The role of the investigator was that of a judge whose task was to discover those strategies which had a utility either for the family or for Nature. Aside from the simple game characteristics, the model assumes "an original state of nature" or a situation in which the game is not played. That is, if Nature takes no move to undermine the integrity of the family, the family will develop according to a life-cycle considered desirable according to the culture of the community. However, should Nature make a "move" against the orderly development of the family life-cycle, family integrity would be threatened and counteracting strategies must be developed. At any given point in time the family life-cycle is defined by the domestic values of the members and the specific roles in use at that time. (Here, a specific role is regarded as a given point in the development of a career.) These define the present stage of development (roles) and the desired direction of movement (values). But agreement by husband and wife on values and coordination of roles is, by definition, the degree of marital inte- gration (9). Hence, if there is disruption in the development of roles or a confusion in domestic values, this disturbance in life-cycle development should be reflected in the degree of marital integration. Inasmuch as the domestic value hierarchy defines the direction of move- ment in the family life-cycle, in an integrated marriage there is implied a clear-cut focus of the parents on a single aspect of family life-the develop- ment of children, the welfare of the parents, or the promotion of the home. Furthermore, at any given point in time in the integrated marriage, the roles of the family members are so organized to direct the family members consistently toward gratification in the chosen aspect of family life. When the family life-cycle is disrupted by the presence of the severely retarded</page><page sequence="86">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 87 child, the family must reorganize its activities to maintain a consistent focus upon a given aspect of family life. The major hypothesis of the study was that, especially where the strate- gies employed by Nature against the family were potentially severely dis- ruptive to marital integration, a consistent orientation by the parents toward the welfare of the normal children, the home, or the parents themselves was necessary to maintain a high marital integration. In the investigation the orientations included in the hypothesis were defined on the basis of (a) whether the parents sought emotional support from within or outside the nuclear family, (b) valuation of the normal children by the parents, (c) the parents' tendencies in daily interaction and division of labor as reflected in their value systems, and (d) the parents' attitudes toward community participation as a reflection of their priorities in developing their life career. The orientations were: r. The integrative child-oriented family was one in which both husband and wife were favorably inclined toward high social mobility; the husband emphasized traditional rather than companionate values in family life; the wife identified highly with at least one of her normal children; under certain conditions, interaction between normal and retarded siblings was limited; and emotional support was provided by the wife's mother or the community. 2. The integrative home-oriented family was one in which either the husband or wife cared little about social mobility; the husband stressed companionate values in family life; under certain conditions, interaction between normal and retarded siblings was limited; and either the parents were highly integrated in the neighborhood or the husband identified highly with his wife. 3. The integrative parent-orientated family was one in which the parents were favorably inclined toward a high degree of social mobility; the husband stressed companionate rather than traditional values in family life; and the husband identified highly with his wife. All families which lacked any of the characteristics required for classi- fication in one of the above three categories were placed in a fourth category. In the first three categories the families were regarded as having a focus around which to organize the lives of the family members so that the husband and wife could achieve mutual gratification with respect to their goals. The families in the fourth or residual category, however, were re- garded as either (a) lacking in focus or common orientation or (b) being organized in its system of roles in such a way as to impede gratification pertaining to a common orientation. Hence, the residual category was con- sidered as the grouping of kinds of family organization not conducive to high marital integration of the parents. The strategies of Nature were classified as favorable, unpredictable, or unfavorable. Two criteria were used to classify sets of circumstances accord</page><page sequence="87">88 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS ing to favorableness. The first criterion for classification was the size of the mean marital integration score for parents in that set of circumstances. The second was the internal consistency among each set of circumstances. Each set of circumstances was classified on the basis of the sex of the retarded child, marital prediction score of the parents, religion, social class, and birth order of the child. Internal consistency was determined by the degree to which the set of circumstances met the conditions specified in the following propositions: i. The marital integration of parents with severely mentally retarded boys tends to be lower than that of parents with retarded girls. 2. Parents whose marital integration had been low prior to the birth of a severely retarded child tend to have a lower marital integration at the time of the study than parents whose early marital integration had been high. 3. Middle-class parents of severely mentally retarded boys tend to have a higher marital integration than lower-class parents of retarded boys. 4. Marital integration of Catholic parents of retarded boys is affected less severely than that of non-Catholic parents of retarded boys. 5. Among Catholics, a first-born mentally retarded boy affects the parents' marital integration less severely than does a non-first-born boy. 6. Among non-Catholics, a first-born mentally retarded boy affects the parents' marital integration more severely than does a non-first-born boy. 7. Among middle-class families, the marital integration of non-Catholic parents of retarded girls is affected less severely than the marital integration of Catholic parents of retarded girls. 8. The marital integration of parents of non-first-born retarded girls is affected less severely than the marital integration of parents of first-born retarded girls. Several of the above propositions were studied in the first phase of the analysis of the data reported in (Io). The remainder of the propositions were developed on the basis of case study and the present analysis. Results The findings pertaining to the relationship between the use of child- oriented, parent-oriented, and home-oriented strategies and marital integra- tion were: I. When parents who used consistent parent-oriented, child-oriented, or home-oriented strategies were compared with those who did not, the parents who utilized one of the three consistent orientations were found to have a higher marital integration than the others. This result was statistically sig- nificant for families in favorable, unpredictable, and unfavorable circum- stances, respectively. However, the difference in marital integration between parents who used one of the three strategies hypothecated as integrative and those who did not was greatest for families faced with unfavorable circum- stances.</page><page sequence="88">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 89 2. For each level of favorableness of circumstances, parents of children in institutions who used the putatively integrative strategies had a higher marital integration than similar parents who used other strategies. Similarly, parents of retarded children at home who utilized the hypothetically inte- grative strategies tended to have a higher marital integration than those who did not. 3. Among those families using the putatively integrative strategies, there was no statistically significant difference in marital integration between parents with a retarded child in an institution and parents with a retarded child at home. Although these results were not statistically significant among families who used the putatively integrative orientations, the difference in mean marital integration between parents with a retarded child in an insti- tution and parents with a retarded child at home increased with the decrease in favorableness of circumstance. As a result, for families faced with un- favorable circumstance, the mean marital integration of parents with a child in an institution was substantially higher than that of parents with a re- tarded child at home. In contrast, parents who did not utilize one of the putatively integrative strategies showed no consistent difference in degree of marital integration between families with a retarded child at home and those with a child in an institution. 4. Because of imperfections of theory and technique, the investigator can take into account only a few of the major strategies-he must regard the remainder as idiosyncratic and not in accordance with the rules of the game as the investigator defines them. The data were examined to determine some of these unanticipated strategies. The analysis revealed that: a. When families faced with favorable circumstances had only one child (the retarded child) and kept this child at home, they generally had high marital integration. If parents faced with unfavorable circumstances kept their only child (who was retarded) at home, they generally had very low marital integration. b. When the family met all the criteria for the child-oriented integrative strategy except that the mother did not identify with any of her normal children, by improvising compensating acts or moves, the parents were able to maintain high marital integration. These compensating moves included hiring a full-time maid or the wife's taking a part-time job. 5. In dealing with the relationship between normal and retarded sib- lings at home, it was found that: a. When the retarded child was young, interaction between normal and retarded children of approximately the same age tended to be on an equali- tarian or playmate basis. For older children the normal sibling (especially if this normal child was a girl) tended to assume a superordinate position in the relationship. b. Normal girls who interacted frequently with their retarded sibling tended to be involved in more tense role relations with their mother than</page><page sequence="89">90 FAMILY ORGANIZATION AND CRISIS did normal sisters who engaged in little or no interaction with the retarded child. The results were inconclusive for the normal brothers of retarded siblings at home. Since these findings were based upon judgments of open- ended responses which were sometimes vague, the results should be verified with more adequate instruments. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESEARCH The results of the study seem to have the following implications for families with a severely mentally retarded child: I. Type of family orientation rather than institutionalization per se seems important for the marital integration of the parents. Whether or not to place the child in an institution is necessarily a decision which the parents themselves must make. In making this decision, the parents should consider institutionalization not as a solution in itself of problems regarding the retarded child and other family members. Rather, they should contem- plate institutionalization or keeping the child at home in the context of the various other steps that must be taken to maintain a healthy family life for themselves and all of their children. Institutionalization may be important insofar as it increases the opportunity for the parents to develop a consistent family orientation. 2. The degree of marital integration of the parents of severely mentally retarded children is not a function of either (a) the severity of the crisis situation or (b) the strategies used by the family, but is a resultant of the combination of the two. This result implies that in treatment the counselor or social worker must consider both the severity of the crisis and the pro- cedures for developing integrative strategies to provide adequate therapy. Although common sense would indicate in general that such a procedure should be followed, common sense does not specify the importance of the sex of the child, the social class of the parent, or the religion of the parent as important determinants of the severity of the crisis. Nor does common sense specify the necessary steps to be taken by the individuals as family members in counteracting the crisis. Steps should be taken to increase the agreement of the :parents on their values pertaining to family life. Then, recommendations can be made as to the appropriate actions to be taken with respect to matters of social mobility, neighboring, relations with own parents and in-laws, division of labor between the parents, the place of the normal children in the family, and the solution of specific husband-wife problems. 3. Normal sisters (but not brothers) are given parent-substitute respon- sibilities and are seen by the mother to be affected adversely. The mothers whose daughter interacts frequently with the retarded child tend to view the daughter as moody, stubborn, easy to anger, or having other negative traits more often than mothers whose daughters do not interact frequently</page><page sequence="90">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 91 with the retarded child. We assume that this difference in perception grows out of the conflicts and anxieties generated between mother and daughter when many responsibilities for the retarded child are placed upon the daughter. Both the present sample and other studies have indicated that a close mother-daughter relationship facilitates the daughter's later marriage and personal adjustment. Hence, the results suggest that the parents of retarded children should be aware of the possible consequences to the mental health of the normal daughter if she is given a surrogate (or parent-substitute) role in relation to the retarded child. THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESEARCH The study has two kinds of implications for sociological theory: I. As discussed in the introduction, the game-of-strategy model provides a general hypothesis for organizing the data. The model clarifies the rela- tionship between the motivation of the family members, the "normal" pattern of family life, the severity of the crisis, the strategies developed to counteract the crisis, and the resulting family integration. Furthermore, with the concept of idiosyncratic strategies or "cheating," the model encour- ages the search for workable strategies not anticipated in setting up the research and thereby facilitates serendipity. 2. In the testing of generalizations related specifically to family life, the research suggests that: a. Variation in the development of the family life-cycle can explain differences in both the marital integration of parents and the role of normal siblings (especially girls) in the family. b. A consistent organization of the parents' source of emotional support, their interaction with and valuation of children, their daily routine and division of labor, and their community participation around a given aspect of family life provide a basis for high marital integration. c. The mother's expectation that her normal daughter frequently assume a surrogate role may prevent the girl from developing a healthy personality (3). Stated in terms of feminine role expectations, the findings suggest that placing much emphasis upon the instrumental (e.g., care, protection, and training the retarded child) aspects of the daughter's family role inhibits the girl's development of social-emotional aspects of behavior. Since, in American culture, girls are supposed to be social-emotional role specialists (25), the daughter cannot assume this social-emotional role adequately when she is expected to do so in ordinary social relations.</page><page sequence="91">REFERENCES I.
