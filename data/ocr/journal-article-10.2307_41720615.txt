In spite of the similarities between human conversation and communicatory interactions in non-human animals, the evolutionary sci- ence of Animal Communication and Conversation Analysis have never engaged in interdisciplinary discourse. The objective of this manuscript is to introduce students of Animal Communication to the field of Conversation Analysis. We begin with a historical overview of the field, and go on to describe its theory, methodology, major discoveries, and current directions. We then discuss the similarities and differences between Conversation Analysis and Animal Communication, conclud- ing that both fields could benefit from cross fertilization. Keywords Animal Communication, Conversation Analysis, countersong, duet, interdisciplinary, linguis- tics, signaling. 1. Introduction The behavioral mechanisms that structure human conversation and other forms of 'talk in interaction' are the purview of Conversation Analysis, an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of Sociology, Linguistics, and Com- munication (reviewed by Levinson, 1983; Heritage, 1984, 2008; Goodwin &amp; Heritage, 1990). Students of Animal Communication also study reciprocal communicatory interactions, such as countersinging (Todt &amp; Naguib, 2000), duetting (Hall, 2009) and aggressive signaling (Waas, 1991; Jennions &amp; Â© 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden DOI: 10.1 163/1 568539X-00003031</page><page sequence="2">1284 A primer of conversation analysis Backwell, 1996). In spite of the obvious similarities between human conver- sation and communicatory interactions in animals, Animal Communication and Conversation Analysis have not engaged in interdisciplinary discourse up to this point (throughout this manuscript, we use 'Animal Communica- tion' to describe the contemporary study of animal communication in an Evolutionary framework; for comparisons of vocal communication in hu- mans and birds, see Salwiczek &amp; Wickler, 2004; Todt, 2004; Berwick et al., 201 1). The authors of this manuscript are a Behavioral Ecologist who studies vocal interactions in birds and a Sociologist who uses Conversation Analysis to study human communication. This brief manuscript represents our attempt to introduce students of Animal Communication to Conversation Analysis, opening what we hope will be a productive dialogue between the two fields. Interdisciplinary scholarship encourages practitioners of a particular dis- cipline to think in unfamiliar ways, and stimulates scholars to take an exter- nal perspective on their own field. To make an analogy that should be familiar to most readers, Conversation Analysis and Animal Communication are like two distantly related populations that have colonized similar environments. The two fields began very differently - Animal Communication arose from Evolutionary Biology and Conversation Analysis from Sociology. As they evolved in response to the demands of their subject matter, however, they have converged on many points. As we discuss below, there are significant differences between the two approaches. Such differences may be conse- quences of their separate histories, the differences between humans and other animals, and various accidents of history. Considering those similarities and differences offers a unique and valuable perspective on the Animal Commu- nication approach. We have attempted to craft this manuscript in a way that avoids cer- tain pitfalls of interdisciplinary scholarship. First, we have chosen not to write a 'back-and-forth' comparative analysis of Animal Communication and Conversation Analysis. Many readers of this journal are experts in An- imal Communication, and any attempt to briefly summarize this approach would necessarily fall short of readers' own expertise. Second, throughout most of the manuscript we attempt to dispassionately explain the Conver- sation Analytic approach and leave it to our readers to decide if any of its theories or methods may be usefully integrated into their own practice. Only at the end of the manuscript do we briefly offer our own opinions about</page><page sequence="3">D.M. Logue, T. Stivers / Behaviour 149 (2012) 1283-1298 1285 the usefulness of Conversation Analysis to students of Animal Communi- cation. Third, we recognize that humans are very unusual animals, and that human conversation differs in significant ways from other forms of animal communication. Humans syntactically arrange words to produce an effec- tively infinite array of communicative functions. We are conscious of some of our mental activities, we express purpose-driven behavior, and we simulate the mental processes of others (see Conclusions). Most students of Animal Communication would agree that non-human animals do not exhibit these behaviors to the same degree as do humans. We therefore caution that any attempt to apply Conversation Analysis to non-humans must guard against assumptions of anthropomorphism. We begin the body of this report with an overview of the history and general approach of Conversation Analysis. We then describe the theory and methodology of Conversation Analysis. Next, we summarize some of the most important findings in Conversation Analysis. We end the manuscript with our conclusions about the value of this interdisciplinary exercise. 2. An overview of Conversation Analysis Conversation Analysis was developed within Sociology by Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The term 'Conversation Analysis' describes both a theory of social interac- tion and a methodology for studying it. Conversation Analysis challenged Chomsky's (1965) view that spoken language was too disorderly to study rigorously, and Bales' (1950) assertion that social interaction could only be studied in the aggregate due to its inherent randomness. Heavily influenced by Erving Goffman's (1964) symbolic interactionism and Harold Garfinkel's (1967) ethnomethodology, the founders of Conversation Analysis argued that human vocal interaction is an ordered process that is amenable to systematic study (Sacks, 1992, p. 484). As a theory of social interaction, Conversation Analysis holds that con- versation is built out of sequences of action. As such, language is not funda- mentally concerned with 'meaning' but with implementing actions such as greeting, requesting, offering, inviting, complimenting, chastising, and in- sulting. Moreover, the theory asserts that people produce and recognize each other's social actions via a norm-governed system. Insofar as social interac- tion is norm-governed, people are expected to hold one another accountable for violations of these norms.</page><page sequence="4">1286 A primer of conversation analysis Within the social sciences, Conversation Analysis is on the quantitative end of qualitative methods insofar as it is concerned with robust patterns across multiple data sets. Compared to Animal Communication, however, Conversation Analysis is a highly qualitative method. Conversation Analysis is also more reliant on observation of naturally occurring phenomena and inductive reasoning than is Animal Communication. Inherent to the Conversation Analytic approach is the assumption of order at all points in social interaction (Jefferson, 1983; Sacks, 1992). Specifically, while it may be that certain aspects of social interaction are not orderly but are random, Conversation Analysis begins with the assumption that even the minutiae of conversation may be orderly (e.g., milliseconds of timing in response to a question, grammar choices, lexical choices, and aspects of phonetics such as whether 'uh' and 'uhm' are used differently). In the par- lance of Animal Communication, Conversation Analysis attempts to define the behavioral mechanisms that generate conversation and to describe their functions, at whatever level of detail these can be seen to operate. Conversation Analysis's theory of social interaction dictates certain as- pects of the Conversation Analytic methodology. Practitioners rely heavily on audio or audiovisual recordings of naturally occurring social interaction, because such recordings allow for repeated inspection and analysis of social interaction 'in the wild'. To identify conversational 'practices' that are robust across a given community (or across languages/cultures), Conversation An- alytic scholars collect samples from diverse contexts. In common with more quantitative fields, Conversation Analysis relies on distributional evidence. For example, a robust pattern of behavior should show that when interactant A exhibits behavior X, interactant B 'typically' or 'usually' responds with behavior Y. However, the method also relies on data-internal evidence such that if interactant B responds with behavior Z it is not only 'unusual', but insofar as such a response deviates from a social norm, interactants are ex- pected to treat behavior Z as unusual or 'marked'. We will return to this idea later on. 3. Conversation Analysis theory 3. 1 . The function of actions In Conversation Analysis, the 'function' of a particular interactional practice is defined in terms of its communicative effect. In the coarsest sense, the</page><page sequence="5">D.M. Logue, T. Stivers / Behaviour 149 (2012) 1283-1298 1287 function of a practice is the social action that it performs (e.g., a request or an offer). In Conversation Analysis, a given practice may also be said to have a fine-grained function, as in the choice to use the referent's name to refer to another individual (Schegloff, 1996a) versus the invocation of the recipient's relationship to the referent (e.g., 'your daughter' said by a mother to a father), which both refers to the individual and conveys the speaker's view of the recipient's responsibility for that individual (Stivers, 2007). 3.2. The importance of context Conversation Analysis considers the context of an interaction to be of paramount importance. For any given utterance there are not only the de- tails of how it is said (e.g., an offer done as 'I could pick her up' vs. 'Would you like me to pick her up?'; see Curl, 2006) but the turn in which it is said (e.g., is it the only thing that is said or is it part of a series of things?), the sequence of actions that the turn either initiates or responds to, the larger activity in which the sequence is nested (e.g., in the case of the offer, has the prior person just indicated trouble picking up her daughter or not), and finally how that activity is situated in the overall structure of the interaction (is this positioned as a problem that is the reason for a phone call or visit, or is it situated elsewhere?). Changes in context can change the meaning of a given turn at talk. For example, the statement 'Somebody just vandalized my car' may function as an announcement of news or as a request for help, depending on the type of vocal interaction that is taking place (Whalen &amp; Zimmerman, 1987). Not only is the meaning of an action affected by the context in which it occurs, but the action itself affects the context going forward (Goodwin &amp; Heritage, 1990). Thus, every action is said to be both 'context shaped' and 'context renewing' (Heritage, 1984). Conversation Analysis is particularly interested in the relationship between sequential context and the turn. A mantra within the field is that analysis of any turn in a conversation includes analysis of both the composition of the turn (i.e., its grammar, prosody, and lexical content) and its position in the conversation (Schegloff, 1984). This sets Conversation Analysis apart from most other studies of language from within Linguistics, which focus on the sentence to the exclusion of the sequential context. 3.3. Recipient uptake As discussed in the previous section, Conversation Analysis researchers rec- ognize that a receiver's response 'gives meaning' to a sender's utterance such</page><page sequence="6">1288 A primer of conversation analysis that, 'It's raining' can be heard as a relevant response to 'Do you want to go for a walk?' despite the fact that it is not a typical yes or no answer (Schegloff, 2007, p. 20). Moreover, behaviors that might not have an obvi- ous vernacular label (e.g., 'request' or 'invitation') can be analyzed as having a particular communicative function when we observe their uptake. For in- stance, people across different languages can use a broad repair initiator such as 'What?' to request clarification of something that was not heard or was not understood. However, Selting (1996) has shown that when this token has a sharply rising pitch, the recipients offer explanations or justifications for the event in question. For instance, A might say 'He just left.' to which B replies 'What?'. If B's 'What?' has only a slight rise it is typically understood as initiating repair of a typical hearing or understanding problem and receives a rephrasing or restating such as 'He just left for home'. But if B's 'What?' has a sharp rise at the end, A will typically understand B not to be simply initiating repair but to be displaying astonishment at what A had said, which may lead A to defend the report (e.g., 'Well, he has to work at five in the morning tomorrow ' ) . 4. The methods of Conversation Analysis 4.1. Asking questions In their review of Conversation Analysis, Clayman &amp; Gill (2004), suggest two ways to approach data. In the first, the researcher uses unmotivated observation to seek out interesting phenomena. Specifically, the observation should not be biased toward particular goal, so that the researcher is open to serendipity. Clayman &amp; Gill's (2004) second way to approach data is to examine a known action (e.g., asking questions or giving advice), with the goal of transcending the commonly held understanding of that action. This can be achieved, they suggest, by imagining alternative ways in which the action could be designed, and the consequences of such alternatives. 4.2. Gathering data The data for Conversation Analysis come from detailed transcriptions of video or audio recordings of natural interactions. Transcribed data include words, the details of pronunciation, silent intervals, non-verbal sounds pro- duced by the participants, and in the case of video data, body position and</page><page sequence="7">D.M. Logue , T. Stivers / Behaviour 149 (2012) 1283-1298 1289 gestures (see Example 1). A typical analysis begins by identifying and de- scribing some pattern of behaviors generated by the mechanisms of social interaction. Researchers then analyze the function of the interactional prac- tice of interest. 4.3. Observation versus experimentation Although some experimental investigations of social interaction have been successful (e.g., Bavelas et al., 2002 examined story telling behavior ex- perimentally and their findings appear to hold in naturally occurring story telling; Stivers, 2008), experiments and contrived interactions are generally eschewed by Conversation Analysis. Indeed, Schegloff (2004, p. 272) ex- plicitly warns against experimentation, in part because "experiments rarely detect change on a dimension not deliberately measured." In common with many of his colleagues, Schegloff (1993) takes the conservative viewpoint that an investigator must "know what the phenomena are, how they are orga- nized, and how they are related to each other as a precondition for cogently bringing methods of quantitative analysis to bear on them," and concludes that "in some cases [this will] arguably [prove] unrealizable" because con- versation is such a complex system (p. 1 14-1 15, italics in original). Further, Conversation Analysis practitioners have argued that the independent ma- nipulation of variables is at odds with a key tenet of Conversation Analysis theory, which holds that each contribution to interaction shapes the next turn and is shaped by the prior (Schegloff &amp; Sacks, 1973; Heritage, 1984). A final argument against experimentation in Conversation Analysis is that because participants are highly attuned to context, experimental results do not neces- sarily bear on human behavior in natural contexts. 4.4. Statistical analysis Conversation Analysis has traditionally employed an inductive, qualitative approach to problem solving (Schegloff, 1996b), and some within the field have gone so far as to admonish the use of hypothesis testing (Schegloff, 1993). Several contemporary Conversation Analysis workers, however, now use hypothesis testing and other quantitative methods to study associations between qualitatively identified interactional behaviors and attitudes, demo- graphic variables or outcomes (Clayman et al., 2006; Stivers et al., 2003, 2009). They use tests that would be familiar to most Behavioral Ecologists, including ordinal logistic regression, chi-squared tests, and Fisher's exact tests.</page><page sequence="8">1 290 A primer of conversation analysis 4.5. Deviant cases The Conversation Analysis method insists that deviant cases be analyzed and interpreted. This practice should not be confused with attending to outliers. Rather, Conversation Analysis hypotheses actually attempt to explain all of the variation in the dataset, rather than just part of the variation, as is typically the case in Animal Communication and other fields within Animal Behavior. The rationale for this approach is that conversation is a domain in which interactants regulate each other through accountability to a shared system of norms. Deviant cases allow researchers to learn whether interactants act as though a norm has or has not been breached. Thus, Conversation Analysis relies on distributional evidence to establish trends or 'unmarked' forms of behavior and then looks to document the ways in which individuals 'orient to' underlying social norms. Conversation Analysis's insistence on explain- ing all variation in behavior might appear to ignore communication errors, but a practitioner would argue otherwise. If humans exhibit accountability to conversation norms, both a speaker who makes an error and her partner will show an awareness of the error during the interaction. The study of name use in conversation exemplifies Conversation Analy- sis's reliance on both distributional evidence and deviant cases. Early work found that referring to third parties by name was the most typical form of person reference when talking about another person (Sacks &amp; Schegloff, 1979; Schegloff, 1996a). Stivers (2007) discovered that when people make reference to one individual while talking to another individual who is also acquainted with the referent, they use first names (e.g., 'I saw Sara yester- day') or kin titles that behave like first names (e.g., Mom, Grandma) about 90% of the time. Roughly 10% of the time, however, they use some other form of reference. Schegloff (1996a) first used deviant cases to show that speakers showed a preference for names as in Example 1 (this is also a good example of transcription methods in Conversation Analysis). There Char- lie is phoning llene to tell her that a driving trip will not happen because the girl with whom Charlie and llene were going to stay is not going to be in town. Charlie first identifies 'Karen' as 'the gi:r-' (the girl), prob- ably attempting to say something like, 'the girl we were going to stay with'. The colon in 'gi:r-' represents an elongation of the sound whereas the hyphen represents a glottal stop of sound. He then redoes the sentence</page><page sequence="9">D.M. Logue, T. Stivers / Behaviour 149 (2012) 1283-1298 1291 'I spoke tih' allowing him to replace 'the girl' with the name 'Karen'. (1) Trip to Syracuse, 1:10-11 [Schegloff, 1996a, p. 463] Charlie: hhhe:h .hhhh I wuz uh:m: (.) .hh I wen' ah:- (0.3) I spoke teh the gi:r- 1 spoke tih Karen This kind of event shows that although a speaker may at times use some- thing other than a name, often when they do, they themselves treat that as less than ideal. Stivers examined a larger set of deviant cases and found that when people do not refer to a third party by name, they tend to talk about the individual by reference to someone else, usually either the speaker or recipient (e.g., 'Your father'; 'My sister'). In doing so, they are usually posi- tioning the referent as closer to the speaker or closer to the recipient, thereby implying responsibility (whether blame or credit) for some action such as a complaint about 'your sister' or a request on behalf of 'your grandson'. This is not the place to go into detail on what that reveals about the use of names, but the preceding case exemplifies why Conversation Analysis carefully an- alyzes cases that deviate from the trend. Namely, because it is assumed that deviations are not random, but rather they reflect accountability to the norms of the system. Deviating from the norm can make possible new communica- tive actions because both speaker and recipient will recognize deviations. This can only be true in a norm-governed system where departures from a norm will be produced and understood as such. 5. Major discoveries in Conversation Analysis 5.1. Agreements and disagreements Conversation Analysis practitioners have uncovered many 'loci of order' us- ing the methodologies described above. For example, they have discovered that in social interactions, agreeing is typically done differently than dis- agreeing. Usually, agreements are fast, direct (or even upgraded by making a stronger assessment than the first speaker) and devoid of mitigation (e.g., 'a little' or 'kind of'). By contrast, disagreements tend to be relatively slow and oblique, and are often accompanied by mitigation (Pomerantz, 1984). A related finding concerns the repair of problems in speaking, hearing or understanding. Although either party may endeavor to repair a problem, in- teractants will generally wait for the original speaker to repair the turn and</page><page sequence="10">1292 A primer of conversation analysis only if she fails to do so will the recipients initiate the fix (Schegloff et al., 1977). Both of these findings relate to prosocial motives. 5.2. Turn taking Following a number of hypotheses about how humans take turns at talk, Sacks et al. (1974) argue that interacting speakers do not wait for pauses. The authors describe 14 group-level phenomena that can be observed in almost any natural conversation. Examples of the phenomena include the observations that speaker-change occurs, that overlapping talk and gaps be- tween speakers occur but are generally brief, and that turn order and turn length are variable. The authors recognize that transitions do not tend to oc- cur at random places in conversations. Rather, there are particular points - transition-relevance places (TRPs) - at which a different speaker might start speaking. The turn-taking rules that they propose offer an explanation for how members view rights and obligations to take turns. (1) For any turn, at the initial transition-relevance place of an initial turn- constructional unit: (a) If the turn-so-far is so constructed as to involve the use of a 'current speaker selects next' technique, then the party so selected has the right and is obliged to take next turn to speak; no others have such rights or obligations, and transfer occurs at that place. (b) If the turn-so-far is so constructed as not to involve the use of a 'current speaker selects next' technique, then self-selection for next speakership may, but need not, be instituted; first starter acquires rights to a turn, and transfer occurs at that place. (c) If the turn-so-far is so constructed as not to involve the use of a 'current speaker selects next' technique, then current speaker may, but need not continue, unless another self-selects. (2) If, at the initial transition-relevance place of an initial turn-constructional unit, neither la nor lb has operated, and, following the provision of lc, current speaker has continued, then the rule-set a-c re-applies at the next transition-relevance place, and recursively at each next transition- relevance place, until transfer is effected (Sacks et al., 1974, p. 704). Critically, these are formulated as rules, with the evidence not only that people do this most of the time, but also that when people do not follow</page><page sequence="11">D.M. Logue, T. Stivers / Behaviour 149 (2012) 1283-1298 1293 these rules they act (and are treated) as if they are violating a rule. The original findings were supported by quantitative follow-up studies on Dutch speakers (de Ruiter et al., 2006) and across a 10-language sample (Stivers et al., 2009). If the observed pattern of gap and overlap avoidance is norm- governed, then the presence of a gap or overlap can be understood as a viola- tion of the 'one-at-a-time' rule. According to the principles of Conversation Analysis, speakers should treat such violations as problematic. Moreover, if the one-at-a-time rule is a general property of social interaction rather than language-specific grammar, it should be consistent across languages. Indeed, the modal gap between turns in the ten language study was zero, and gaps appeared most regularly in the same kinds of places across all languages (e.g., before people answered a question with a disconfirmation rather than a confirmation; Stivers et al., 2009). 5.3. Contemporary areas of study in Conversation Analysis Contemporary Conversation Analysis work focuses on identifying new con- versational practices and improving our understanding of known practices, such as the person reference system discussed above (Enfield &amp; Stivers, 2007). It also seeks to understand the degree to which various practices are universal among humans, versus culturally or linguistically circumscribed. Two other topical areas that are currently of potential interest to students of Animal Communication include (i) the organization of gaze behavior, a topic enjoying a renaissance of interest in the extent to which gaze is organized by reference to individuals' turns at talk versus larger sequences of action (for a review, see Rossano, 2013) and (ii) the way in which social actions are designed and understood, given the scarcity of communicative resources to definitely indicate what social action is intended (for a review, see Levinson, 2013). 6. Conclusions This introduction to Conversation Analysis has identified many points of convergence with Animal Communication, as well as many important dif- ferences between the two fields. Some of the differences trace their origins to the distinctive histories of the two fields. For example, Ethnomethodolo- gy's (and related fields') reliance on qualitative methods predates the origin of Conversation Analysis. Some differences between the two fields that cannot be attributed to his- torical accidents result from fundamental differences between humans and</page><page sequence="12">1 294 A primer of conversation analysis other animals. For example, the tremendous complexity of human language limits the ability of Conversation Analysis to use the sort of quantitative tech- niques that are commonplace in studies of much simpler signaling systems in animals. Perhaps more importantly, humans appear to have the cognitive capacity for a level of complexity in communication that is not shared with other animals. Levinson (2006) identifies a suite of uniquely human cogni- tive properties and behavioral proclivities that he calls a 'human interaction engine.' He argues that the presence of the interaction engine sets human communication apart from the communication systems of other animals. One of the interaction engine's properties is the ability to mentally sim- ulate the partner's simulation of the self. Dennett's (1983) hierarchy of in- tentionally recognizes this property as 'third order' intentionality. A tenet of Conversation Analysis holds that speakers construct their actions to be recognized by particular recipients. For instance, speakers may refer to the same individual in three different ways to three different recipients (e.g., as 'Bob'; 'the guy who always comes in late'; and 'Kevin's brother'). The re- ferring expression is fitted to the way in which the speaker believes that the recipient will understand who is being referred to and the way that the recip- ient expects the speaker to refer to the referred to individual (e.g., Schegloff, 1972). If I know three people named 'Bob' and you refer to 'Bob', then I consider who you would mean to refer to with that reference and who you would think that I would think you would mean by that reference. Tests on great apes indicate that they do not employ third order intention- ality, even when doing so would result in reward (Tomasello et al., 1997; Hare &amp; Tomasello, 2004, but see Hare &amp; Tomasello, 2005 for evidence of higher order intentionality in the dog, Canis domesticus). Thus, many or all non-humans may have a limited capacity to engage in the kind of higher or- der 'mind reading' that is fundamental to human communication (Levinson, 2006). While current evidence is not generally consistent with other animals hav- ing this level of intentionality, Levinson also suggests another property which may or may not transcend human interaction, the property of cooperation. This use of the term refers to the assumption of cooperation during signal- ing interactions, and should not be confused with the more general forms of cooperation (e.g., reciprocal cooperation) studied by evolutionary biologists. According to Conversation Analysis theory, a presupposition of cooperation permeates human social interaction (e.g., Pomerantz &amp; Heritage, 2013). If a</page><page sequence="13">D.M. Logue, T. Stivers / Behaviour 149 (2012) 1283-1298 1 295 speaker asks 'Do you want to go for a walk?' and the recipient asks a ques- tion such as 'Is it cold out?' rather than providing a yes or no answer, the original speaker will generally still presuppose that the recipient is cooperat- ing and answer his/her question ('Yeah, you might want a jacket'). In doing so, the speaker treats the recipient's question as relevant to the recipient say- ing whether or not s/he wants to go on a walk. Notice that in this example the assumption of cooperation has generated an interaction with an embedded structure: one exchange (about the weather) is nested within another (about going for a walk). Such embedded structure is believed to emerge uniquely from cooperative communication. Students of Animal Communication could contribute to our understanding of social interaction by testing whether non-humans exhibit embedded struc- tures and other properties that are hypothesized to emerge from the human interaction engine. Animal communication systems that might be appropri- ate for studying embedded structures would have multiple pairs of linked conversation actions ('adjacency pairs' in Linguistics). Animals that gener- ate duets according to 'duet codes' (Logue, 2005) might be appropriate. Many of the similarities between the Animal Communication and the Conversation Analytic approaches to the study of communication appear to have evolved as a consequence of convergence in response to similar subject matter. For example, both fields recognize that group-level commu- nicative phenomena emerge from individual-level behavioral mechanisms. Both fields study these mechanisms by considering alternative behavioral rules and modeling their consequences. And perhaps most remarkably, both fields recognize that the responses of signal receivers are crucial to under- standing the function of a communicative act. These points of convergence between Conversation Analysis and Animal Communication should reassure practitioners in both fields. We encourage each reader to draw his or her own conclusions about the practical applicability of the Conversation Analysis approach to their own work. Here, we draw attention to one aspect of the approach that we be- lieve may be particularly useful to students of Animal Communication. As discussed above, Conversation Analysis assumes that receivers' responses can reveal when senders have committed transgressions against communi- cation norms. We point out that this is not equivalent to simply conducting experiments that test the receiver's response to signal variation. To verify this logical tool with an Animal Communication experiment, one might conduct</page><page sequence="14">1296 A primer of conversation analysis interactive playback according to a hypothesized norm, then violate the rule in various ways and measure the subject's response. Once a response to norm violation is established in a particular species, it might be possible to quan- tify the occurrence of 'mistakes' and transgressions of norms in ways that have previously eluded Animal Communication. It is our opinion that many of the tenets of Conversation Analysis are applicable to communication in other species. In spite of the uniqueness of human language and interaction, we conclude that certain fundamental rules underlie interactive communication in both humans and non-human animals. This conclusion suggests broad potential for future exchange and introgression between Animal Communication and Conversation Analysis.
