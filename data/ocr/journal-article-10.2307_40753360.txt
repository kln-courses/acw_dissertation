<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Image of Judaism: German- Jewish Intellectuals and the Ban on Images Leora Batnitzky The question of whether God can be represented visually or otherwise is a question as old as Jewish thought itself. In this essay, I focus on some of the ways in which German- Jewish intellectuals formed an image of Judaism through an argument about the second commandment ban on image making. This argument and its subsequent image of Judaism be- came a major philosophical, aesthetic, and political theme for German- Jewish intellectuals. By German- Jewish intellectuals, I refer not only to Jewish intellectuals living in Germany but also to German speaking Jews in other lands. I will suggest that a number of important, early twentieth century German-speaking Jewish intellectuals measured both their rela- tion to and distance from German culture through an interpretation of the second commandment ban on images. On the one hand, the inter- pretation of the second commandment as an all out ban on visuality represented for German- Jewish thinkers a kind of hyper-rationality and thus the confluence between Judaism and modernity. At the same time, however, German- Jewish thinkers also presented the purported hyper-rationality of the second commandment as a way of understand- ing modern antisemitism and thus the distance between Judaism and German society. /. The Ban on Images in Jewish Thought The philosophical debate about the second commandment and visuality has its classic statement in the thought of the medieval Jewish philoso- pher Moses Maimonides, who argued that because the masses continu- ally forget that idols are representations, and not true divinities, they are continually tempted by idolatry. According to Maimonides, this is the reason image-making is forbidden. But once the problematic of idolatry Jewish Studies Quarterly, Volume 11 (2004) pp. 259-281 © Mohr Siebeck - ISSN 0944-5706</page><page sequence="2">260 Leora Batnitzky JSQ 1 1 and representation has been reduced to a problem of language, how can the Bible's own blatantly anthropomorphic language be explained away? Here is the starting point for Maimonides' claim that linguistically we can describe God only negatively, that is, by what God is not. Almost the entire first half of The Guide of the Perplexed attempts to explain to the perplexed person the Bible's use of anthropomorphic language to describe God. Maimonides explains that what seem to be biblical anthropomorphisms are actually only metaphors that aid the ordinary person in the attempt to grasp God's reality: When they [the rabbis] said, "The Torah speaks in the language of peo- ple," they meant whatever all people are able to understand at first thought ... Therefore they described Him in terms that refer to material being, in order to teach that He exists, since the masses cannot grasp exis- tence at first glance unless it is the existence of a body.1 The philosopher, Maimonides argues, recognizes the needs of the masses and therefore that anthropomorphic language is always meta- phorical.2 In modern Jewish thought, and particularly in the German- Jewish context, this seemingly academic argument about the human ability to represent God, visually or otherwise, was explicitly linked to social and political arguments. Before turning to these German- Jewish discussions, it is important to note that the view that the second commandment is an all-out ban on visuality is a dominant theme of modern German philo- sophy. Perhaps most famously, Immanuel Kant associated the second commandment ban on images with a sublime sensibility. Describing the sublime, Kant writes: For though the imagination finds nothing beyond the sensible that could support it, this very removal of its barriers also makes it feel unbounded, so that its separation [from the sensible] is an exhibition of the infinite; and though an exhibition of the infinite can as such never be more than merely negative, it still expands the soul. Perhaps the most sublime passage in the Jewish Law is the commandment: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven or on earth, or under the earth, etc. This commandment alone can explain the enthusiasm that the 1 Moses Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed, trans.

Leo Strauss (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963) 1:26, p. 56. 2 There is an alternative tradition that suggests that the problem of idolatry does not concern the object of worship but the type of worship. For more on this theme, see Leora Batnitzky, Idolatry and Representation: The Philosophy of Franz Rosenzweig Re- considered (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000); Moshe Halbertal and Avishai Margalit, Idolatry (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992); and Kaiman Bland, The Artless Jew (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000).</page><page sequence="3">(2004) The Image of Judaism 261 Jewish people in its civilized era felt for its religion when it compared itself with other peoples ...3 While Kant connects what he calls this supreme sublimity with the com- mandment "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image," a com- mandment he explicitly describes as "Jewish," Kant nonetheless argues elsewhere that Judaism is not really a religion at all. Kant writes: Judaism is not really a religion at all but merely a union of a number of people who, since they belonged to a particular stock, formed themselves into a commonwealth under purely political laws, and not into a church .... We cannot, therefore, do otherwise than begin general church history, if it is to constitute a system, with the origin of Christianity, which, completely forsaking the Judaism from which it sprang, and grounded upon a wholly new principle, effected a thoroughgoing revolution in doctrines of faith.4 It is against this German philosophical backdrop - the simultaneous claim that the second commandment reflects a sublime moral sensibility and that Judaism does not measure up to Christianity - that the modern German- Jewish intellectuals considered in this essay respond. We will see that German- Jewish thinkers not only produced a specific image of Judaism by way of a consideration of the ban on images, but they also responded to the negative image of Judaism held by their Christian neighbors. From Moses Mendelssohn to Hermann Cohen, German- Jewish thin- kers argued that there was no tension between Judaism and reasoned enlightenment, and that in fact the second commandment ban on image making represented the confluence between the two. This tradition of German-Jewish thought sought to speak to two worlds at once: the Jewish and the German ones. Jewish thinkers responded both to the Jewish theological problem of whether God can be represented (visually or otherwise) as well as to a particular problematic raised by and sus- tained after the German Enlightenment: why hadn't Jews contributed historically to German culture and art? Culminating in Hermann Co- hen's claim that Judaism is ethically one-sided in regard to culture, Ger- man-Jewish thinkers suggested time and time again that it was the Jew- ish historical task to uphold monotheism precisely by resisting the lure of vision.5 It is no coincidence this German- Jewish philosophical tradi- 3 Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Judgment, trans.

He becomes conscious of it as something seen. In contrast, to the Jew who knows that the divine exists beyond, outside of, and prior to nat- ure, God reveals Himself through a demonstration of His will, through the medium of the ear .... Paganism sees its god, Judaism hears Him.7 It is important to note, however, that Graetz does not discard aesthetics entirely. He goes on to claim that due to the ban on image-making, Judaism is the originator of a more sublime aesthetic sensibility: Artistic expression also develops differently according to different con- ceptions of God. The artistic act created in Greek paganism ... [is] the art of sculpture, that lovely fragrant blossom of the pagan form of perception. In Judaism, on the other hand, which perceives its God in the alternatively loud and soft sounds of the movement of the waves, in the rhythm of word sounds ... gave birth to music combined with religious poetry.8 In his 1919 posthumous Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Juda- ism, Cohen reiterates Graetz's musings on the aesthetic implications of monotheism. Cohen attests to the ethical superiority of biblical aes- thetics and is even more explicit than Graetz: "prophetic monotheism is necessarily opposed to, necessarily contradicts art."9 However, Cohen goes on, the question may be raised whether the peculiar kind of poetry of the Bible could have arisen if the plastic arts had not been checked. This pecu- liarity consists in the lyric poetry of the psalms, which sing neither of God alone nor of man alone. Plastic art, however, can only present an isolated depiction of both. Thus plastic art would have impeded the lyric style, for which the relation of God and man becomes the problem of its monotheistic aim.10 6 See Elliot Wolfson's Through a Speculum that Shines (Princeton: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1994) for broad overview of vision in Kabbalah. 7 Heinrich Graetz, "The Structure of Jewish History," in The Structure of Jewish History, ed. and trans.

But first let us turn to the some of the avenues in which this seemingly philosophical argument extended into German-speaking culture at large. //. Extending the Argument to Art and Psychoanalysis This argument about the philosophical meaning of the ban on images extends beyond the confines of strictly theological and historical inquiry. It is in fact possible to read Arnold Schoenberg's monumental opera, Moses and Aaron through some of the fundamental assumptions of Co- hen's philosophy and aesthetic theory.11 Using his serialist technique, Schoenberg's opera Moses and Aaron grapples with the philosophical tension between idolatry and representation both musically and thema- tically. The opera revolves around the tension between truth and beauty, between our constant desire yet inability, to know and represent the infinite. The opera begins with a series of notes that express God's pre- sence as Moses encounters God at the burning bush. These opening notes are the only text-expressive idea or theme dominating the entire opera. However, with God's communication of God's self to Moses, the notes begin to sound distorted. Schoenberg utilizes the purest form of his twelve-tone system, the opening notes through which the entire Op- era is developed, to represent God. He uses the distortion of the notes, which reaches its height in the character of Aaron to reflect the implicit tension that arises in the finite human's desire to know the infinite God. On the one hand, for both Schoenberg and Cohen, the second com- mandment ban on images represents the confluence between Judaism and German-culture. Cohen's critical idealism and his interpretation of the ban on images have the same animating feature; each recognizes through a use of reason that knowledge of God marks the limits of human thought. As such, each attempts to uncover what Cohen calls "the lie and self-deception of idol worship." Schoenberg's interpretation of the second commandment opens a door to new possibilities of musi- cal expression and in this sense is in keeping with Graetz's claim that Judaism's abstention from visuality gives "birth to music combined with religious poetry." In the context of what he takes to be the second com- 11 For an extended discussion, see Leora Batnitzky, "Schoenberg's Moses und Aron and the Judaic Ban on Images," Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 92 (March 2001), pp. 81-98.</page><page sequence="6">264 Leora Batnitzky JSQ 1 1 mandment ban on visuality, music, in Schoenberg's words, does not decorate but is true. At the same time, however, Cohen and Schoenberg's interpretation of the hyper-rationality of the second commandment ban on images also marks their distance from German culture. Schoenberg began and wrote much of Moses and Aaron from 1930 to 1932, during which time he suffered increasingly from antisemitic prejudice. As is well known, Schoenberg returned to Judaism in 1933 after having converted to Lutheranism in 1898. Schoenberg thought of Moses and Aaron as a central work, among others, that was directly related to his return to Judaism, as he wrote to his student Alban Berg, "my return to Jewish religion took place long ago and can be recognized in my work."12 It seems clear that Cohen was also aware of increased antisemitism as he penned his Religion in the last years of his life. He had after all left Marburg in the face of growing, blatant antisemitism, antisemitism that he had experienced for his entire professional life. Both Cohen's aesthetic theory and Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron reflect an ongoing inter- Jewish conversation about the meaning of antisemitism and Jewish suffering. A thematic point that dovetails the tension between Moses and Aaron is the notion that only a very few can actually live with convictions like Moses's. Schoenberg's opera suggests that this is the special role of the Jewish people, a role which brings about terrible suffering, as we hear Moses reflecting in Act III about the fate of the Jewish people: "The ungratifying, pure teachings of God. So shall scorn attend you, persecu- tion consecrate you; so shall sorrow sanctify you."13 Significantly, this is precisely Cohen's view of Israel's role in adhering to the ban on idolatry. He writes in the Religion of Reason: "As Israel suffers, according to the prophet, for the pagan worshipers, so Israel to this very day suffers vicariously for the faults and wrongs which still hinder the realization of monotheism."14 For both Schoenberg and Cohen, monotheism is a psychological mystery. Not only is the truth of monotheism extraordi- narily difficult to sustain, but it invites scorn and hatred from others. While beauty is its own reward, truth exacts a very high price and often leads to terrible suffering and persecution. 12 Arnold Schoenberg to Alban Berg, October 16, 1933, as translated in Letters.

In a letter of September 30, 1934 Freud wrote to Arnold Zweig regarding Moses and Monotheism that: "Faced with new persecutions, one asks oneself again how the Jews have come to be what they are and why they are so hated." And Freud attempts to answer his own question in Moses and Monotheism with an argument about the ban on images: Among the precepts of Mosaic religion is one that has more significance than is at first obvious. It is the prohibition against making an image of God, which means the compulsion to worship an invisible God .... The prohibition was perhaps a fresh precaution against magical malpractices. If this prohibition was accepted, however, it was bound to exercise a pro- found influence. For it signified subordinating sense perception to an ab- stract idea; it was a triumph of spirituality over the senses; more precisely, an instinctual renunciation accompanied by its psychologically necessary consequences.16 Like Graetz, Cohen, and Schoenberg, Freud maintains that a self-im- posed, Jewish resistance to visuality marks Judaism as a rationally and morally advanced civilization: In a new transport of moral asceticism the Jews imposed on themselves constantly increasing instinctual renunciations, and thereby reached - at least in doctrine and precepts - ethical heights that had remained inacces- sible to the other peoples of antiquity.17 For Freud, the second commandment's ban on image making captures what he calls the "transport of moral asceticism" that the Jewish religion introduced to the world. 15 Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, Freud's Moses: Judaism Terminable and Interminable (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991); Jacques Derrida, Archive Fever: A Freudian Interpretation, trans.

As is well known, English translations of Freud are often misleading. To describe this Jewish relation to instinctual renunciation, Freud uses the word Rausch, which means intoxication, and is often used, for example, in colloquial German to refer to drug addicts. The English translation, however, renders Rausch as "transport." Although transport does tech- nically mean to be imbued with strong emotion, it misses the German sense of drunkenness and ecstasy. Freud's point is that the Jewish cri- tique of sensual desire produces a new kind of passion: a passion for self-control. The paradox is that rather than obliterating all passion, this passion for self-control is exhilarating; it is, in fact, intoxicating. Freud suggests that Judaism has produced a relation to desire that is not simply affirmative or negative. The ban on images reflects a call for control of sensory desire, but is in no way a rejection of desire. Rather than negating or denying desire, the Jewish critique of desire produces a new kind of relationship to desire. This relationship to desire is an ethi- cal relationship. Ethics for Freud is not a negation of sensuality, but an achievement of a new kind of sensuality. Freud defines ethics as the advancement of a new kind of bodily enjoyment that elevates the in- stinctual to the spiritual. Mastery of instinct becomes a spiritual enjoy- ment, from which the human being, and the Jew in particular, feels uplifted. This feeling, in fact, is akin to a sensual enjoyment of the high- est order; it is an intoxication.18 That the human being should feel up- lifted by the mastery of his or her instincts is mysterious, but this mys- tery, Freud suggests, is ethics itself.19 While Freud argues that this relationship to desire, and the Jew's relation to the one, unique God, brings with it these new ethical, spiri- tual, and sensual heights, he also argues that this relationship to desire brings tension as well. In fact, the Jewish relation to desire is tension itself. In Freud's words, this relation "bears the characteristic of being never concluded and never able to be concluded with."20 The Jewish relation to desire is the tension of critiquing desire while living with desire. Desire and sensuality are accepted as givens, and so is the fact that human beings desire infinitely. But the ethical task of the human being is to regulate his or her own desire. This need for regulation is, like desire itself, infinite. The human being must thus live with the tension that comes from both infinite desire and infinite regulation. For Freud, 18 Ibid., 173. 19 Ibid., 15OfF. 20 Ibid., p. 172.</page><page sequence="9">(2004) The Image of Judaism 267 the Jewish critique of desire and the Jewish relation to desire creates an infinite task that can never be completed. The Jewish relation to desire is a refusal to present clear resolutions to human desire. The ban on images is, for Freud, the root of this very refusal of clear resolutions. The Jew is continually in a situation of desiring to know his or her God fully, but of not being able to do so. Just as the Jewish critique of desire does not obliterate desire, so too the ban on images does not negate the intimate relation within which the Jew exists to his or her God. Rather, the Jew lives simultaneously with a knowledge of both relation to and separation from God. This kind of relationship is not static, but vital. It produces a dynamic which "bears the character- istic of being never concluded and never able to be concluded with." And adds Freud, this dynamic should be familiar to those who know something about psychoanalysis; it is one "we are familiar [with] in the reaction-formations of obsessional neurosis." Like Schoenberg and Cohen, Freud argues that Judaism's insight, represented by the ban on image making, into the fundamental human condition is at the same time intimately linked to antisemitism. Like Schoenberg and Cohen, Freud maintains that antisemitism stems from a denial of human finitude, a finitude that is recognized by Jewish monotheism: We must not forget that all the peoples who now excel in the practice of anti-Semitism became Christian only in relatively recent times, sometimes forced to it by bloody compulsion. One might say they all are 'badly chris- tened'; under the thin veneer of Christianity they have remained what their ancestors were, barbarically polytheistic. They have not yet overcome their grudge against the new religion which was forced on them, and they have projected it on to the source from which Christianity came to them . . . The hatred of Judaism is at bottom hatred for Christianity, and it is not surprising that in the German National Socialist revolution this close con- nection of the two monotheistic religions finds such clear expression in the hostile treatment of both.21 Freud argues, like Schoenberg and Cohen, that antisemitism is an ac- companying discontent of the ethical demands of the ban on visuality. The Christian hatred of Judaism is at bottom self-hatred. Freud's argu- ment is that while the second commandment ban on visuality recognizes human finitude and its resultant call for ethical responsibility, the anti- semitic point of view holds a grudge against Judaism for forcing the demands of finitude - demands that they cannot meet - upon them. Freud in fact argues that the difference between Judaism and Christian- 21 Ibid., pp. 116-117.</page><page sequence="10">268 Leora Batnitzky JSQ 1 1 ity consists in the Jewish refusal to resolve the unfulfilled longings of human finitude.22 Freud, Schoenberg, and Cohen agree that the excessive ethical demand implied by a Judaic ban on images includes the excessive responsibility of suffering for those whose own failures do not allow them to accept the truth and responsibilities of human finitude. We have seen that German- Jewish intellectuals formed an image of Judaism as excessively rational and ethical by arguing that the ban on images is an implicit rejection of visuality. Let me state clearly that these German- Jewish arguments are not about whether actual Jews engage in artistic activity or participate in cultural life. The argument instead is that the meaning of Judaism as a philosophical and theological system does not consist in visual expression. The tension between what actual Jews do and the meaning of Judaism is captured in each of these thin- ker's arguments that Jews themselves, and not just non- Jews, betray the pure ideal of monotheism. This tension between the ideal and reality animates Moses and Aaron's relationship in Schoenberg's opera, Freud's contentions about the internal tensions in the Israelite commu- nity that led to the murder of Moses, and Cohen's arguments about the philosophical meaning of the prophet idea of the remnant of Israel. ///. Late Twentieth Century Thoughts on the Ban on Images and Antisemitism The image of Judaism formed by way of a reading of the second com- mandment as an all out ban on visuality and its implications for explain- ing antisemitism is one that has had a life beyond the early twentieth century German- Jewish context. This argument lives on not only in the work of the German- Jewish intellectuals Max Horkheimer and Theo- dore Adorno who emigrated to the United States but also in the argu- ments of much of late twentieth century French philosophy, such as Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-François Lyotard.23 While a full account of these diverse and complex theories is of course 22 Ibid., p. 173. 23 See Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. John dimming (New York: Seabury Press, 1972); See Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity, trans.

Horkheimer and Adorno articulate a broader social and political the- ory than Cohen, Schoenberg, and Freud do but much of their argument about the dynamics of antisemitism is predicated on the same assump- tions as these early twentieth century German- Jewish thinkers and (as they acknowledge) on Freud in particular. According to Horkheimer and Adorno, the Jews "transformed taboos into civilizing maxims when others still clung to magic."24 It is this very transformation by way of the ban on images that constitutes what Horkheimer and Adorno call the "dialectic of enlightenment." They write: The disenchanted world of Judaism is reconciled with magical thought through its negation in the idea of God .... It associates hope only with the prohibition against calling what is false God, against invoking the finite as infinite, lies as truth.25 Anson Rabinbach has shown that Horkheimer and Adorno's argument about the relation between what they call a Bildverbot (image ban) and the possibility of civilization is intimately linked to their theory of anti- semitism. As Rabinbach succinctly puts it: the Bildverbot also inaugurates the taboo on utopia, on the remembrance of the nomadic condition when labor and homeland did not exist. As such, the expulsion of the Jews from Israel reproduces the expulsion from Para- dise, and the condition of exile, its imitation. According to Adorno it is this taboo, the taboo on the image of utopia, and on the image per se 'that is the origin of anti-Semitism.'26 For Horkheimer and Adorno, antisemitism "is the counterpart of true mimesis, and fundamentally related to the repressed form; in fact it is probably the morbid expression of repressed mimesis."27 Like Freud, Horkheimer and Adorno maintain that antisemitism is at bottom pagan resentment over the ban on images. To repeat Freud's words, "they have not yet overcome their grudge against the new religion which was forced 24 Dialectic of Enlightenment, p. 186. 25 Ibid, p. 23. 26 See Anson Rabinbach, "Outwitting the Historical Dynamic: Mimesis and the Construction of Antisemitism in Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlighten- ment,1'' in In the Shadow of Catastrophe (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), p. 186. 27 Dialectic of Enlightenment, p. 187.</page><page sequence="12">270 Leora Batnitzky JSQ 11 on them, and they have projected it on to the source from which Chris- tianity came to them."28 While in important ways politically at odds with Horkheimer and Adorno, a number of postmodern French philosophers also equate what they argue is the specifically Jewish ban on images with an inter- pretation of antisemitism. In his book Heidegger and "the jews " Jean- François Lyotard defines 'the jews' not as a specific people or a specific religion but as those who have recognized the truth of the ban on images. For Lyotard, "the jews" are those who are taken hostage by a voice that does not tell it anything, save that it (this voice) is, and that all representation and naming of it are forbidden, and that it, this people, only needs to listen to its tone, to be obedient to a timbre ... it inscribes this memory into its tradition, it turns into memory this forgotten [revelation] and makes a virtue of having a deep regard for memory, the Achtung, the Kantian 'respect' ... It is asked not to represent, not to stage the original difference, as is the case with all religions, including Christianity, by means of sacrifice, the first representational economy.29 Like Cohen, Schoenberg, Freud, Horkheimer and Adorno, Lyotard seeks to explain antisemitism in general (and the "Heidegger affair" in particular) by way of an interpretation of the ban on images. He writes: anti-Semitism is one of the means of the apparatus of its culture to bind and represent as much as possible - to protect against - the originary terror, actively to forget it. It is the defensive side of its attack mechanisms - Greek science, Roman law and politics, Christian spirituality, and the Enlighten- ment, the 'underside' of knowledge, of having, of wanting, of hope. One converts the Jews in the Middle Ages, they resist by mental restriction. Drawing on Freud, Lyotard argues that the relation between a continual forgetting and an original remembering marks the tension between "Heidegger" and "the jews," which is the very tension of the ban on images itself. Recently, Jacques Derrida has expanded Lyotard's argu- ment, maintaining that "religion" is the presence of this very absence, while violence is the very denial of this absent present. In Derrida's words, "Everything begins with the presence of that absence."30 We have seen that Lyotard, Derrida, Horkheimer and Adorno self- consciously draw on Freud to make their respective arguments about the 28 Rabinbach notes that Horkheimer quoted these very words of Freud in a popular lecture in Los Angeles in 1943 (In the Shadow of Catastrophe, p. 189). 29 Jean-François Lyotard, Heidegger and "the jews ", trans.

We turn fi- nally to the French- Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas who also makes much of the ethical implications of the ban on images in his philosophy, but with more self-consciously evident theological over- tones. In his first major work, Totality and Infinity, Levinas argues that: The vision that apprehends on the horizon does not encounter a being out of what is beyond all being. Vision is a forgetting ... because of the essential satisfaction, the agreeableness of sensibility, enjoyment, content- ment with the finite without concern for the infinite. In fleeing itself in vision consciousness returns to itself. Like Lyotard, Levinas associates, especially in part three of Totality and Infinity, the realm of vision (described also as presence) with the possi- bility if not inevitability of violence and murder (described also as for- getting). But Levinas also explicitly contrasts what he calls the visible idol of art against what he maintains is the unseen revelation of the divine: "The face is present in its refusal to be contained ... It is neither seen nor touched . . . Speech cuts across vision . . . The formal structure of language thereby announces the ethical inviolability of the Other."31 Like his German- Jewish predecessors Cohen and Schoenberg, Levi- nas posits a fundamental distinction between the plastic arts and music. Referring to his early essay "Reality and its Shadow," published in 1948, Levinas argues in his second major work, Otherwise than Being or Be- yond Essence that: In its indiscrete exposition and in its stoppage in a statue, in its plasticity, a work of art substitutes itself for God ... By an irresistible subreption, the diachronic, the non-contemporaneous, through the effect of a deceitful and marvelous schematism, is 'imitated' by art, which is iconography. The move- ment beyond being is fixed in beauty.32 With Cohen and Schoenberg, Levinas contrasts beauty with truth and maintains that music, as opposed to the plastic arts, captures a funda- mental truth, and not a deception, regarding the human condition. Using musical imagery, Levinas holds that body and soul "are in accord prior to thematization, in an accord, a chord, which is possible only as an arpeggio."33 In contrast, "[plastic] art ... endows things with some- thing like a façade - that by which objects are not only seen, but are as objects on exhibition ... By the façade the thing which keeps its secret is 31 Totality and Infinity, pp. 194-195. 32 Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de l'essence (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1974); Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence, trans.

Levinas's entire philosophical project hinges on the attempt to show that revelation is fundamentally ethical in character; as such, it withstands what Levinas contends is the violence of the visual realm. Levinas's is both explicitly and implicitly a post-Holocaust philoso- phy and he joins Derrida, Lyotard, Horkheimer, Adorno, Freud, Schoenberg, and Cohen in linking the ban on images with ethics and the refusal of this ban on visuality with antisemitism. Indeed, it is worth noting Levinas's dedication in Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence: "To the memory of those who were closest among the six million assas- sinated by the National Socialists, and of the millions on millions of all confessions and all nations, victims of the same hatred of the other man, the same anti-semitism." Like Derrida, Lyotard, Horkheimer, Adorno, Freud, Schoenberg, and Cohen, Levinas maintains that the hatred born of anti-semitism has its philosophical root in a disdain and resentment for the ethical life and the ban on images. IV. An Alternate Image of Images In the remainder of this essay, I would like to turn to the thought of Franz Rosenzweig, the last in a long line of German- Jewish thinkers and arguably the most significant Jewish philosopher of the twentieth cen- tury, if not the modern period. Rosenzweig is significant in this context because the hallmark of his thought is a rejection of the image of Juda- ism created by German- Jewish rationalists. At the same time, Rosenz- weig, more than any other Jewish thinker, dedicated a considerable phi- losophical effort to developing a comprehensive and systematic aesthetic theory.35 In these contexts, it is striking that Rosenzweig nonetheless 34 Ibid., 192-193. 35 Martin Buber also spent considerable time thinking about the relation between art and Judaism. For more on Buber, see Buber's introduction to Juedischer Kuenstler, ed. Martin Buber (Berlin: Juedischer Verlag, 1903), pp. 1-6. In this short piece, Buber agrees with Wagner's description that Jews lack creativity [Unfruchtbarkeit]. Signifi- cantly, Buber blames the Jewish legal tradition and praises Hasidism in contrast. Buber suggests that contemporary Jewry could and should begin to create visual art. See Avram Kampfs Jewish Experience in the Art of the Twentieth Century (South Hadley, Mass: Bergin and Garvey, 1984), pp. 15, 203 for a discussion of the early Buber's attitudes toward Judaism and art. See also Gavriel D. Rosenfeld, "Defining 'Jewish</page><page sequence="15">(2004) The Image of Judaism 273 defines Judaism in terms of an abstention from visuality and equates this abstention with an interpretation of antisemitism. Rosenzweig criticizes the German- Jewish rationalist image of Judaism both in terms of its denial of a living, vibrant Jewish relationship with God and in terms of what he considers its apologetic stance towards German culture and society. It is as much in response to what he per- ceives as a German- Jewish apologetic for Judaism as it is in response to the question of whether or not God can be represented that Rosenzweig writes toward the end of the Star of Redemption: it is not human illusion if Scripture speaks of God's countenance and even of his separate bodily parts. There is no other way to express the Truth. Only when we see the Star as countenance do we transcend every possibility and simply see.36 At the core of the Star's aesthetic theory is a revaluation of vision, which had been devalued precisely by the rationalist, German- Jewish tradition.37 To begin with, Rosenzweig's "Star of Redemption" is a fig- ure as well as a title. Both literally and philosophically, the Star's three parts culminate in the figure of a Star of David. Represented by a trian- gle that points upward, part one describes a logic of three unrelated elements: god, world, man. In part two, the triangle's point is turned downward, or in the language that the Star borrows from Schelling, inverted, because the elements are now in relation with one another. In part three, the overlapping triangles of parts one and two come together to form a Star of David. Judaism and Christianity are together repre- sented by Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption, Judaism forming the inner part of the star, its fire, and Christianity forming the outer part, its rays. The Star's implicit and explicit embrace of vision attacks Graetz and Cohen's wissenschaftlich polemic at its very core: the assumption that the Bible maintains that God cannot be represented.38 As he would Art' in Ost und West, 1901-1908: A Study in the Nationalisation of Jewish Culture" in Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook 39 (1994): pp. 83-1 10.

Properly speaking, Rosenzweig maintains, there is no "anthropomorphism" in the Bible. Rather, "the 'anthropomorphisms' of the Bible are throughout assertions about meetings between God and man."40 Once we under- stand that the Bible's descriptions of God are about meetings that take place in time, rather than about essences that are eternal, we can understand that the Bible does not "assert something either about God or about man, but only about an event between the two."41 Rosenzweig argues that the philosophical problems created by "biblical anthropo- morphisms" are a result of a category error. The Bible is not concerned with what God is, but rather with how God acts, in time, in God's relation to the human being.42 Rosenzweig suggests that this category error stems from a German- Jewish, rationalist attempt to turn the dynamic tension of what he calls the German- Jewish Zweistromland (land of two streams, the title of the only collection of Rosenzweig's essays published during his life time) into a single stream that denied the vitality of two incomparable and incommensurable traditions. Indeed, Rosenzweig maintained that the German- Jewish relation gained its creativity precisely because the two sides of the hyphen could not be synthesized or, in Hermann Cohen's terms, correlated.43 Rosenzweig in fact concludes the Star by reversing Graetz's and Cohen's dichotomy between seeing and hearing: "But what he gave me to see in this Beyond of life - is none other than what I was already privileged to perceive in the midst of life; the difference is only erally God can only be known negatively, by what God is not.

The Star's embrace of vision is coupled with an aesthetic theory in each of the three parts of the Star. This aesthetic theory is not incidental. As Rosenzweig boldly claims in the Star, "Of everything empirical, art alone is essen- tial."45 Rosenzweig elevates vision to a status higher than hearing and art to a status higher than thought. Paradoxically, however, it is precisely in connection to what the Star has to say about aesthetics, and how the Star makes its argument, that the full import of Rosenzweig's argument about the Jewish people and its relation to visuali ty is to be found. To begin with, Rosenzweig shares with Graetz and Cohen the equation of the pagan and vision. Unlike his German- Je wish counterparts, however, Rosenzweig does not discount the pagan valorization of vision, but ar- gues that the Greek/pagan relationship to vision is an achievement for all of humanity. Rosenzweig argues that the Greek/pagan valorization of vision produces the commonality that is the prerequisite for universal community. The realm of vision, then, for Rosenzweig is equated with a pagan recognition of finitude. Rosenzweig contrasts the pagan's recognition of his finitude, a recog- nition that is painful and solitary, to the Christian's recognition of fini- tude, which is shared communally.46 He contends that while pagan art can only produce a sense of lonely commonality, Christian art can pro- duce a community that transcends, though does not negate, the suffering plight of the human being. Christian arts are unique because they are the only arts which can wholly cure him of that disease of alienation from the world which plunged the art lover into the misleading delusion of su- preme health just as he exposed himself defenselessly to the disease. Thus art is its own anti-toxin. It decontaminates itself, and man, from its own pur- ity.47 Rosenzweig is certainly unique among Jewish thinkers, and German- Jewish thinkers in particular, in valorizing Christian images. Nonethe- less, as most of his interpreters, both Christian and Jewish, have failed to recognize, Rosenzweig's positive assessment of Christian images and art 44 Stern, v. 41 '/ Star, a 424. 45 Ibid, p.212/p. 190. 46 Ibid, p.420/p.377. 47 Ibid, p. 393 /p. 354. He continues "From demanding sweetheart it turns into good wife, strengthening him for the market-place and the important hours of life with a thousand small everyday kindnesses and domestic duties, and thereby first flowering into the small, mature beauty as lady of the house."</page><page sequence="18">276 Leora Batnitzky JSQ 1 1 is intimately connected to his deep awareness of the lethal potentiality of Christian antisemitism.48 It is here that we once again encounter the same purported relation between Judaism's abstention from visuality and the meaning of antisemitism. In the face of an argument for the world-redemptive potential of Christian art, Rosenzweig contends that it is the Jewish mission to guard Christianity against visuality: And withal: the Jew does it. Not with words, for what would words still avail in this realm of vision! But with his existence, his silent existence. This existence of the Jew constantly subjects Christianity to the idea that it is not attaining the goal, the truth, that it ever remains - on the way. That is the profoundest reason for the Christian hatred of the Jew, which is heir to the pagan hatred of the Jew. In the final analysis, it is only self-hate, directed by his existence; it is hatred of one's own imperfection, one's own not-yet. By his inner unity, by the fact that in the narrowest confines of his Jewishness the Star of Redemption nonetheless still burns, the Jew involuntarily shames the Christian ...49 While the Star has elevated vision above both thought and hearing, Rosenzweig concurs with the German- Jewish rationalists that the Jew - by way of his mere existence - guards Christianity precisely against vision! The Jew's existence shames the Christian and the realm of beauty that he has built for himself. Though Rosenzweig does not deny vision its due, he nonetheless defines Judaism as that which resists vision for the sake of the advancement of humanity. Rosenzweig concurs with Co- hen, Schoenberg, and Freud in attributing Jewish suffering to Christian- ity's failure to achieve pure monotheism. V. The Image of Judaism (Again) In connection with his argument that Christian self-hatred is a result of Christian resentment about Judaism's advanced status, Rosenzweig sug- gests that it is the Jewish mission to suffer for pure monotheism. While rejecting their interpretation of the ban on images as an all-out ban on visuality, Rosenzweig nonetheless produces an image of a Jewish people who suffer because others cannot accept pure monotheism: Israel intercedes with him [God] on behalf of the sinning peoples of the world and he afflicts Israel with disease so that those other peoples may be 48 See Leora Batnitzky, "Dialogue as Judgment, Not Mutual Affirmation: A New Look at Franz Rosenzweig's Diaological Philosophy," The Journal of Religion 79:4 (October 1999): 523-544, for more on this point. 49 Stern, p. 459/ Star, p. 413.</page><page sequence="19">(2004) The Image of Judaism 277 healed. Both stand before God: Israel, his servant, and the kings of the peoples; ... so inextricably twined that human hands cannot untangle them.50 Rosenzweig in fact draws on the historically Christian, anti- Jewish im- age of the blindfolded synagogue to make his argument about Judaism's unique relation to vision and its meaning for modern Judaism and mod- ern antisemitism. He writes "Is not part of the price that the Synagogue must pay for the blessing in the enjoyment of which she anticipates the whole world, namely, of being already in the Father's presence, that she must wear the bandages of unconsciousness over her eyes?"51 This argu- ment reverses the Christian supersessionist reading of Judaism. Rosenz- weig maintains that the synagogue does indeed "wear bandages of un- consciousness over her eyes," but these bandages of unconsciousness mark not an ignorance of God's revelation but rather an excess of it. In the context of the Star's argument about art, the point is that the blindfolded synagogue does not require vision - indeed it is blind - precisely because it is a true image of God's revelation for the Christian world. Unlike Cohen, Schoenberg, and Freud, Rosenzweig's image of Juda- ism is not a rejection of the veracity of visuality itself but only a rejection of visuality for Judaism. Rosenzweig argues that vision allows human beings to come close to the divine but Judaism does not require any aid in being close to God. Like Cohen, Schoenberg, and Freud, Rosenzweig argues that this advanced status is captured in a Jewish resistance to vision. All agree, moreover, that antisemitism is the result of the Chris- tian recognition of Judaism's advanced status in relation to the divine. In Rosenzweig's words, when Christian society responds to the true im- age of Judaism, "the vessels of curse and blessing communicate so clo- sely that the latter can overflow only when the former too is full to the brim."52 50 Ibid, pp. 340-341 /pp. 306-307. 51 Franz Rosenzweig and Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, Judaism Despite Christianity, ed.

Conclusion Although his image of images is a positive one, Rosenzweig agrees with his rationalist predecessors that the image of Judaism in the modern world creates equally the potential for universal redemption by way of Jewish revelation or vicious hatred of the Jews. By way of conclusion, I consider how this image of Judaism plays out in the aesthetic of Martin Buber and Rosenzweig's famous translation of the Bible into German. Rosenzweig's work on translation began when he translated the grace after meals while on his honeymoon with his wife Edith (Hahn) in April 1920.53 The following year, on March 10, 1921, he sent his translation to Gershom Scholem with the following remarks: In a sense we are ourselves guests at our own table, we ourselves, I myself. So long as we speak German (or even if we speak Hebrew, modern Hebrew, the Hebrew of '1921'!) we cannot avoid this detour that again and again leads us the hard way from what is alien back to our own.54 We see here already the seeds of what would become Rosenzweig's full- fledged theory of translation. The task of the translator for Rosenzweig is to produce shocked attention in the reader. Only by encountering the alien, he argued, could the Jewish people be led back to what was al- ready its own. In 1923 Rosenzweig translated the poems of the medieval poet Judah Halevi.55 Martin Buber, whom Rosenzweig first met in 1914, gave him comments on his translations. When, in 1925, Buber received a letter from a young publisher, requesting that he undertake a translation of the Hebrew Bible, he thought of Rosenzweig at once. Rosenzweig was already quite ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and he was both excited and disturbed when Buber asked for his help.56 While he did 53 Franz Rosenzweig, Der Tischdank Jüdische Bücherei: Berlin, 1920, volume XXII. 54 As quoted in Glatzer, p. 102. 55 Rosenzweig began work on the Judah Halevi translations in 1921, worked on the translations mainly in 1922, and published them in 1923 with an epilogue written in that year, now published in GS IV, bd 1 . His work on Judah Halevi was inspired by his irritation with the translation by Emil B. Cohen, published in 1921. Rosenzweig wrote that Cohen's translation "annoyed me so much that verse came from it" (as quoted in Glatzer, p. 122). A year and a half after translating the grace after meals, Rosenzweig translated the Friday night service in connection with his adult education efforts at the Lehrhaus. See Franz Rosenzweig, "Häusliche Feier; Lern Kaddisch," in Gabe, Herrn Rabbiner Dr. Nobel zum 50. Geburtstag dargebracht (Frankfurt am Main, 1921). See also Rosenzweig's unpublished translation of the Kol Nidre prayer, which he included in a letter to Martin Buber (Briefe und Tagebücher, ed. Rachel Rosenzweig and Edith Rosenzweig-Scheinmann, (The Hague and Boston: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979). bd 2, pp. 832-833. 56 For an account of Rosenzweig s illness, see Glatzer pp. 108-143.</page><page sequence="21">(2004) The Image of Judaism 279 not then expect to die in the very near future, as he had in the initial stages of his illness, Rosenzweig knew that the project would take a number of years and was therefore apprehensive about beginning it. In order to communicate, he could only use his fingers to point to a type- writer to indicate letters of words. Later, he would only have the ability to blink his eyes. Still, the project began. Buber would translate a section and Rosenzweig would comment on it and make changes. This process continued until Rosenzweig's death in 1929 and Buber finished the pro- ject himself in 1961, long after he had escaped from Nazi Germany to take a post at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In what was intended as a criticism of the Buber-Rosenzweig transla- tion of the Bible, Gershom Scholem captures precisely the aesthetic ef- fect that Buber and Rosenzweig hoped to achieve. He writes to Buber in a letter of 1926: What fills me with doubt is the excessive tonality of this prose, which leaps out almost uncannily [fast unheimlich] from the particular wording (this word is wrong; I mean the niggun [melody] of your translation). If the narratives of Genesis fairly burst with pent-up-pathos (and sometimes actu- ally do so), I dare not think of the melody that prophetic speech will have to assume in your translation.57 Scholem's comment reflects the intended sense of strangeness and for- eignness that Buber and Rosenzweig aimed to produce in their transla- tion. In keeping with his aesthetic theory, Rosenzweig attempted to cre- ate an image of Judaism by way of the biblical text for both modern Jews alienated from their tradition and for Christian society at large. As Scholem notes (again negatively), Buber and Rosenzweig's goal was to produce a sense of the biblical text's uncanny difference from modern life in general and the German language in particular. Rosenzweig's approach to translation suggests that the text itself, as representative of "Judaism," must be made uncanny so that modern people would be able to respond to it, for better or for worse. Significantly, however, while Rosenzweig and Buber aimed to produce precisely an aesthetic image in their translation, their image of Judaism that they present - via the biblical text - is one that is consonant with the German rationalist tradition's de-emphasis of visuality. Recall Graetz's comment above that "Paganism sees its god, Judaism hears 57 Gershom Scholem to Buber, April 27, 1926. Emphasis added.

Rosenzweig and Buber's translation of the Bible into German offers the modern, alienated Jew and the non- Jew a visual image of Judaism (one which is "uncanny"). Yet the Buber-Rosenzweig transla- tion implies that the inner meaning of Judaism is one associated with hearing and not vision. Indeed, one of the main principles of the transla- tion was that the translation must reflect the book as spoken and not as written. Both Buber and Rosenzweig asserted that the Bible was origin- ally a spoken document. Their emphasis at all times was on the text as read. As Rosenzweig writes in his essay "Scripture and Word," the read- ing of the Bible in community is the qeri'ah, the calling out.58 According to Rosenzweig, "The bond of the tongue must be loosed by the eye." In order to loosen the bond of the tongue it is necessary to "free from beneath the logical punctuation that is sometimes its ally and sometimes its foe the fundamental principle of natural, oral punctua- tion: the act of breathing."59 To achieve this, Buber and Rosenzweig used the accent system of the Masoretic text, which sets off different vocalized units through various accent marks. Buber and Rosenzweig maintain that the notion that the text was originally oral is in accor- dance with Jewish tradition. Everett Fox, who today carries on Buber and Rosenzweig's efforts in his translations of the Hebrew Bible into English,60 indicates that in handwritten notes Buber cites the thirteenth century Sefer Hasidim ("Book of the Pious") and the nineteenth century Italian scholar, philosopher, Bible commentator and translator, S. D. Luzzatto, to support the idea that the Masoretic accents point to the spokenness of the text and not just to musical notation.61 The orality of the biblical text meant for Rosenzweig that the Bible is precisely not a work of art. As he put it in his 1927 essay, "The Unity of the Bible," "for those who know no Hebrew, ours remains a 'creative' translation . . . The goal is not beauty but truth; what should be judged is not a Svork of art' but a translation, its fidelities and infidelities."62 From the outside - for the alienated, modern Jew as well as the non- 58 GS III, p. 779 1 Scripture and Translation, translated by Lawrence Rosenwald with Everett Fox (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994). p. 42 59 Ibid. 60 See Fox's The Five Books of Moses (New York: Schocken, 1995). 61 Fox cites a fragment of the Buber Archives box #4a 3, entitled Einige Sätze über den byblischen Rhythmus: Prosa-Poesie.

But from the inside, from the perspective of Judaism itself, Rosenzweig maintains that there is no visual dimension to Judaism. Cohen, Schoenberg, and Freud's Jewish God is a distant one and for that reason cannot be visualized. Rosenzweig's Jewish God is intimately close to his people; therefore Jews do not require vision to be near him. Rosenzweig argues that the non- Jewish world looks at Judaism for knowledge of the divine and eternally resents Jews and Judaism for their intimacy with God. Judaism does not require sight for Judaism is al- ready where she needs to be.</page></plain_text>
