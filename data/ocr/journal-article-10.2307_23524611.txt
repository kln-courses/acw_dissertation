<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOPHANIESTHEOPHANIES IN HOLY PLACES IN HEBREW RELIGION JOHANNES LINDBLOM, Lund, Sweden ACCORDING to a widespread conception the deity dwells in its -iTx sanctuary or at the holy place consecrated to it. At more ad vanced stages of religion the deities are conceived as dwelling in heaven or other localities far from the holy places, but visiting them in order to take part in cultic performances or to confer with their worshippers. Very often the idea of the holy place as a seat of the deity, permanent or temporary, is only an expression of devotional sentiment or poetical feeling. As is to be expected, the holy places are regarded as places where occasionally the deity appears in the form of a theophany. In ancient Greece, for instance, the gods were thought of as dwelling on Olympus or even in heaven, but they liked to visit the places where they were worshipped to receive sacrifices and enjoy the festival ceremonies which were enacted in their honor. Such visits were called epiphanies. Generally the gods did not appear in visible form; they were seen in dreams, or their presence was revealed by different external signs. But real theophanies are also recorded, for instance those of Apollo in in Delphi and of Asclepius in his different sanctuaries. On the occasion of the Celtic invasion Apollo himself appeared in his sanctuary in the form of a youth of wonderful beauty, and the danger was averted. Aelius Aristides in his Orations distinguishes between dreams and visions in a waking state in which he experienced the presence of the god. He tells us that when he was awake the god was seen by him in person. He could touch him and hold his head with his hands. His hair was standing on end, and he shed tears of joy. This is a typical description of a real theophany.1 One example from ancient Mesopotamia may be adduced. In the historical inscriptions of Assurbanipal the following incident is re ported. During a dangerous invasion by the Elamites Assurbanipal experienced a theophany of the goddess Ishtar. The appearance of 1 L.

It is said that the king approached her image, took his stand in front of it, and knelt down at her feet, praying and crying. Introducing her speech with the words: "Be not afraid" (a phrase well-known from biblical records also), the goddess granted the king's wish to destroy his enemy.2 According to Israelite conception Yahweh, despite His trans cendental character, had a close connection with the holy place where He was worshipped. In particular it was believed that He was present in the tent-shrine in the desert as well as in the temple of Jerusalem. In the desert the people was ordered to make a sanctuary to Yahweh, "that He might dwell in their midst" (Exod. 25:8: cf. 29:45). Yahweh meets with Moses at the ark of the testimony. From above the כפרת, from the place between the two cherubim, He speaks to Moses, from here "the voice" (הקול) is heard (Exod. 25:22; 30:6; Num. 7:89). The usual phrase that Yahweh is enthroned on the cherubim shows how deeply rooted in Israelite imagination was the idea of Yahweh's dwelling in His sanctuary. "The tent of meeting" in the wilderness was also called משכן, i. e., the dwelling-place of Yahweh in the midst of His people. It is said that Yahweh's throne is in Jerusalem, because it was believed that He was present in His Temple (Jer. 3:17; 14:21; Ezek. 43:7). Thus it is quite natural that we hear of theophanies both in or over the sacred tent or at the door of the tent, and in the temple of Jerusalem. These theophanies were experienced by Moses, Aaron, and the people in the desert, by Solomon in the temple (I Kings 9), and by the prophet Isaiah in his inaugural vision, likewise in the temple of Jerusalem. In spite of the uncleanness of the sanctuary in Bethel Amos saw (ראיתי) Yahweh standing above the altar (Amos 9:1). Sometimes it is said that Yahweh was really seen, but for the most part He was represented by the ark, further by the pillars of cloud and fire, by fire or "something like fire," by a cloud or a glow of fire (Exod. 16:10; 33:9 ff.; 40:34 ff.; Lev. 16:2; Num. 9:15 ff.; 11:25; 12:5; 14:14; Deut. 4:12, 33, 36; 5:24; 31:15; I Kings 8:10 f.; Isa. 4:5, etc.), by His כבוד (Exod. 16:10; 40:34 f.; Lev. 9:23; Num. 14:10; 16:19; Deut. 5:24; Ezek. 10-11), His name (Deut. 12:5, 11; 14:23; II Sam. 7:13; I Kings 8:16 ff., 29; 9:3; Jer. 3:17; 7:12; Ezra 6:12; Neh. 1:9), and the קול (Num. 7:89; cf. I Kings 19:12 ff.). In Exod. 33:23 Moses is said to have seen "the back" of Yahweh.3 2 A. L.

The distinguished scholar to whom these studies are dedicated has thoroughly treated the question of Yahweh's sanctuaries as His dwelling-places in his stimulating and well-known work The Ark, the Ephod and the "Tent of of Meeting." In his admirable study "Biblical Theophanies" in Zeit schrift furschrift furschrift fur Assyriologie, XXV, 1911 (pp. 139-93), and XXVIII, 1914 (pp. 15-60), the same author has examined the forms of the theoph anies of Yahweh especially His כבוד, with regard also to the different sources. On the following pages I would examine some other significant passages in the Bible to which the idea of theophanies at the holy place is to be applied. What I am here interested in are theophanies which might be called visions in a waking state, not visual experiences in dreams.4 In the account of the first meeting between Yahweh and Abraham in Gen. 12:1 nothing is said of the manner in which Yahweh's com mand was conveyed to Abraham. When asking how the narrator imagined it, we may hardly think of a dream, a vision, or the like, but rather of an inward divine impulse or revelation, such as is ex pressed in later usage by the phrase נתן אלהים אל לב (Neh. 7:5 î c^• Ezra 7:27). In 20:13 the same experience is described by the general expression: "God caused me to wander from my father's house." In Gen. 12:6 f. the situation is different. Abraham, it is said, passed through the land to the holy place of Shechem, i. e., to the oracle terebinth.5 Here he had an extraordinary experience: Yahweh showed mentlichen Religion," Archiv fur Religionswissenschaft, XVIII, 1915, pp. 173 ff-, and, above all, the thorough study by F. Nôtscher, Das Angesicht Gottes schauen (Wiirzburg, 1924), with copious references to particularly Akkadian cultic terminology and even oriental court style. Cf. also E. G.

Barr makes several good remarks on the nature of the theophanies in the O. T. in general. In the following I shall study a specific class of these and in more details than is the case in the brief paper by Barr. 5 This sacred tree is of course identical with the אלון סעוננים in Judg. 9:37■ The name probably designated the tree as one under which diviners used to sit pursuing their profession. Of Deborah, who according to the oldest tradition was probably a seer, it is said that she used to sit under "the palm of Deborah," imparting to men her mysterious communications (Judg. 4:5). Because the tree was holy, i. e., the seat of divine powers, it conferred upon the diviner the inspiration needed. In II Sam. 5:23 f. the trees themselves imparted oracles, as did the oaks of Dodona.</page><page sequence="4">94 JOHANNES LINDBLOM [4] Himself (וירא) to him. Then he built an altar to Yahweh, who had shown Himself (הנראה) to him. The verb used indicates that the nar rator has thought of a vision. Because there is no hint of a dreain or something similar, we have to think that in the narrator's view a theophany was bestowed upon the patriarch while he was staying in the holy place where the Deity was present. Biblical scholars have long ago realized that the narrative in Gen. 15 is made up of heterogenous elements. The narrator has made use of different traditions which were at his disposal. There are in reality two problems which call for a solution. The first concerns itself with the traditio-historical analysis, the second, with the question of how Abraham's experiences, which are described in the narrative, are to be understood, or rather, how they were understood by the narrator or the traditionists who furnished him with his material. It is clear that 1-6 form a unit, followed by another unit which comprises 7-11 + 17-18.6 The chief theme in the first section is the promise of a multitude of descendants. The second section describes a covenant ceremony connected with a promise in regard to the land of Canaan. Between these two sections a third is inserted, the subject of which is the future of the people of Abraham, their sojourn in Egypt and their return to the Promised Land. Most scholars think that this section comprises vv. 13-16, whereas v. 12 should be associated with the tradition of the covenant. In my opinion this is a mistake. The words "the sun was going down, and a deep sleep fell upon Abram" etc., belonged originally to another tradition and are well suited to introduce the divine proclamation of what awaited Abraham's descendants in the future. Using the term תרדמה the narrator wanted to say that in a heavy sleep Abraham was dreaming and in his dream he heard God speaking to him. The Hebrew term means an abnormally deep sleep or lethargy (Gen. 2:21; I Sam. 26:12; cf. Judges 4:21; Jonah 1:5; Prov. 10:5; Ps. 76:7; Dan. 8:18; 10:9); it can also refer to a mental state of apathy (Prov. 19:15) or obduracy (Isa. 29:10; cf. 6:10). Sometimes the תרדמה is connected with significant dreams (Job 4:13; 33:15). This is the case in our passage. What about the story in vv. 1-6? The introductory phrase, "Yahweh's word came to Abram," is taken from the prophetic termi 6 The meticulous analysis performed by earlier commentators seems to go too far; cf. E. L. Ehrlich, Der Traum im Alten Testament, Beihefte zur ZAW, 73 (Berlin, 1953), pp. 35 ff. Vv. 2 and 3 seem to be doublets. We have here an example of a method sometimes practised by the Jewish scribes, i. e., that of combining two variant readings taken from current manuscripts. The text in v. 2 is hopelessly corrupt.</page><page sequence="5">[5] THEOPHANIES IN HOLY PLACES IN HEBREW RELIGION 95 nology and is inserted here by the present narrator. It should be ren dered: "A revelation from Yahweh was imparted to Abram." The revelation is described as a "vision." For vision here stands מחזה. Except for this passage the term מחזה occurs only three times in the Bible: Num. 24:4, 16 and Ezek. 13:7. In the last passage מחזה is an ecstatic vision experienced by prophets; in the Balaam story the term likewise denotes a vision, but a vision typical of a seer, when his "in ward eye" is opened. The term מחזה is never used of what is seen in a dream. Accordingly, we must assume that the narrator in 1-6 wanted to say that Abraham had a vision of Yahweh in which the subsequent dialogue and action took place. If a real vision is described in 1-6, it is of course wrong to conclude from v. 5 (Yahweh brought him out side and showed him the stars), as most scholars do, that Abraham experienced the vision during the night. If the sight of the starry firmament was an element of the vision, no conclusion can be drawn as to the hour when the occurrence took place. From 13:18 we are justified in concluding that, according to the narrator's view, what is told in 15 occurred in the holy place of Mamre, near Hebron. Thus the vision in vv. 1-6 is to be classed among the special group of visual theophanies which were bestowed upon pious men while sojourning at sanctuaries or in similar places. To this tradition the narrator has joined another one which is reflected in vv. 7-11, 17-18. The main theme of this tradition is the covenant ceremony connected with the promise of the land. In im mediately combining this story with the vision which is described in vv. 1-6 the present narrator obviously wanted to represent it as a visionary experience occurring on the same spot. It was certainly thus regarded by the original traditionist, too. Nothing suggests that we have here to do with a dream. The fanciful description of the theophany (v. 17) is characteristic of a vision. In the vision the visual theophany occurred after sunset, the preceding acts, consequently, by daylight. The description of the visit of the three men to Abraham in Hebron and the destruction of Sodom in Gen. 18-19 is more colored by my thology than most traditions in Genesis. Obviously the narrator has here made use of originally independent pre-Yahwistic stories, to which he has given a Yahwistic stamp. In the present narrative Yahweh appeared before the patriarch when he was sitting under the tere binths of Mamre. The relationship between Yahweh and the three men (who presumably were originally three deities) is fairly obscure and a matter of discussion in all commentaries. There is in the nar rative a constant alternation between Yahweh and the others and</page><page sequence="6">96 JOHANNES LINDBLOM [6] between singular and plural pronominal and verbal forms. Some scholars have suggested that the three men together represent Yahweh, so that all three were "Yahweh in self-manifestation" (Skinner).7 Other scholars think of different literary sources, which have been unskilfully joined together, or of an incomplete recension of the text. Gunkel was of the opinion that in 19:17 ff. the singular forms are throughout ascribable to a later hand. It is important to note that the narrative in 18-19 ■s in the main composed of three different stories: (1) The visit of three men, Yahweh and His companions, to Abraham and the dialogue between Abraham and Yahweh connected with it (18); (2) the visit of the messengers to Lot in Sodom and his escape with their help from the city; (3) the Zoar episode, in which Yahweh and Lot are the acting persons (19:17-22). The first story is represented as a theophany; it ends in 18:33, where it is said that Yahweh went away and Abraham went home. The second and third stories are no longer related as theophanies but rendered in a typically mythological-anthropomorphic style. The first of them comes to an end in 19:16. The textual inconsistencies are due to the difficulty of combining these originally independent stories into a coherent whole (in 19:18 אלהם is probably to be changed into אליו). Be it as it may, the present narrative in 18 is intended to represent a theophany, in which Yahweh is seen in a bodily shape. This is evident from the introductory words וירא אליו יהוה. The mention of the terebinths of Mamre aims at emphasizing the important fact that the theophany occurred in a holy place (cf. Gen. 13:18).8 Twice it is said that Abraham received a command from God and that he then arose early the following morning to fulfill the command. 7 Recently this view has been vindicated by G. von Rad in his Commentary in Das Das Alte Testament Deutsch. A. R. Johnson explains the oscillation between Yahweh and the two or three men as depending on the Hebrew concept of the manifestation of the one in the many (The One and the Many in the Israelite Conception of God, [Cardiff, 1942], pp. 34 f.). More than a century ago F. Delitzsch argued that the three messengers together were representatives of Yahweh. L. Rost in his paper "Die Gottesverehrung der Patriarchen im Lichte der Pentateuchquellen," Supplements to VêtusVetus Testamentum, VII (i960), pp. 346 ff., explains the three men in chap. 18 as Yahweh and His two companions. In the fact that two messengers only go on their way to Lot, he finds a tendency on the part of the narrator: Abraham was worthy of seeing Yahweh; Lot was not (p. 351). 8 The term וירא refers to a visionary manifestation of the Deity (cf. Gen. 12:7; 17:1 17:1 ; 26:24; 35:9: Exod. 3:2; 6:3; Deut. 31:15; I Kings 9:2, etc.), whereas the phrase "he lifted up his eyes and looked" in the old sources is used of physical seeing (cf. Gen. 13:10; 22:4, 13; 24:63 f.; 33:1, 5; 37:25; Num. 24:2, etc.), with the exception of what is seen in a dream (Gen. 31:10). In our passage, Gen. 18:2, the phrase is the remnant of an original mythological-anthropomorphic story.</page><page sequence="7">[7] THEOPHANIES IN HOLY PLACES IN HEBREW RELIGION 97 In Gen. 21:12 ff. Abraham was commanded to expel Hagar, in 22:1 ff. to sacrifice Isaac. Probably the narrator here thought of dreams. It is of course impossible to prove conclusively that such was the case, but in the light of many other examples of a similar mode of expression it seems plausible that the narrator had nocturnal dreams in mind. A theophany experienced by Abraham is, however, described in the account of the covenant between God and Abraham in Gen. 17 (be longing to the Priestly Code). It is said that God appeared (וירא) before Abraham and spoke to him, whereupon Abraham fell upon his face. When God had finished talking to Abraham He ascended to heaven (ויעל), (v. 22). A real theophany is here described, but the occurrence is not localized. A A typical theophany in a holy place is, however, reported in the account of the wonderful experience of Jacob in Bethel, Gen. 28:10ff. It is made up of two originally independent stories. According to one tradition, Jacob had a dream in which he saw a ladder (or rather a flight of steps) leading from earth to heaven, on which the messengers of God were ascending and descending. According to the other tradi tion, Jacob saw God Himself standing in front of him (9(עליו and heard Him speak (v. 13). Because Bethel was a מקום, a sacred spot, where God was believed to have been present, we are here permitted to speak of a typical theophany in a holy place.10 The narrative of God's appearance to Jacob in Bethel in Gen. 35:9_I5 is a parallel in the Priestly Code to this story. In the later version there is no trace of a dream; it is said that God showed Himself (וירא) to Jacob and spoke to him. In the conclusion of the narrative (v. 13), it is said that God "ascended" from Jacob into heaven (cf. 17:22). Thus a real vision is here described, and because it took place in Bethel we may call it a theophany in the holy place. The legend of Jacob's wrestling with the deity at the ford of the Jabbok in Gen. 32:23-33 is another example of mythological story telling in the Bible. The occurrence took place at night, but nothing indicates that it is thought of as a dream. A series of features show « Cf. Ehrlich, op. cit., p. 29, and his remark: "Der im Himmel thronende Gott wiirde nicht 'sagen,' sondern 'rufen.' " 10 Biblical scholars referring to v. 16 think that the theophany also took place in a dream. But v. 16 as formed by the present narrator is not conclusive for the concept of the original story of which he made use. The introductory הנה (v. 13) does not, as Ehrlich thinks, necessarily suggest a dream; it is equally fitted to introduce a vision. In countless biblical passages the term serves only to direct the hearer's or reader's attention to what follows as a particularly significant saying or fact.</page><page sequence="8">98 JOHANNES LINDBLOM [8] that here we have to do with a narrative of the same kind as the Mamre-Sodom story. As in that story, pre-Yahwistic mythological motifs have here been used by a narrator, who was a Yahweh believer, in order to form a significant episode in the life of the patriarch. The mysterious figure who assailed the man, who was about to cross the stream, shows every sign of being originally a place numen, attached to the holy place of Peniel and watching at the ford in order to attack travellers who for some reason displeased him.11 His demonic character appears clearly from the interesting feature that he must vanish at dawn, a motif well-known to every folklorist." He declines to reveal his name, which conceals the secret of his essence, according to the idea that he who knows somebody's name has power over him. He did not prevail against the mighty patriarch, who was imagined by the narrator to be a giant. But by touching his hip so that the joint got dislocated he made him limp. The story is obviously based on a primitive cult legend and is at the same time a typical, aetiological tale. It is intended to explain three facts: the origin of the name Yisra'el, which the narrator inter prêts as "he who fights with God,"13 the name of the place, Peniel, and the custom at a slaughter of severing as taboo the nervus ischiadicus from the edible parts of the animal.14 From our point of view it is of prime significance to note that the chief interest of the present narrator was to say that the man who " Parallels in classical antiquity to Jacob's wrestling with the divine being are collected by H. Gunkel in Die Schriften des Alten Testaments in Auswahl, I, I2 (Gottingen, 1921), p. 232. E. Westermarck tells similar stories from Morocco, about jinn who attack men. On a moonlit night on the bank of a river a scribe met a jinn in the shape of a black man, who was about to assail him, but became frightened at the sight of his gun. Another man, it was told, once met a little baby who suddenly changed into a giant. The monster, of course a jinn, gave him a blow which made him lame for three years; Ritual and Belief in Morocco (London, 1926), I, pp. 262 ff. (esp. pp. 265 f.). Many parallels to this story are also to be found in J. G. Frazer, Folk-LoreFolk-Lore in the Old Testament (London, 1918), II, pp. 410 ff. 12 Westermarck says that the jinn are regarded as particularly terrible at night, but disappear at daybreak; ibid., p. 374. 13 The explanation of the name of Yisra'el which is here given by the pious Yahwistic narrator has of course nothing to do with a scientific derivation of the word, nor should it be called folk-etymology in the common sense of the term; it is rather akin to allegorical interpretation, in which one looks for a deeper implication in a text or a word, considered as something mysterious and profoundly significant. 14 In Morocco certain parts of slaughtered animals are sometimes regarded as noxious or even taboo, and for this reason uneatable. Thus, for instance, the head, the tongue, the ears, the spleen, the throat, the testicles, the kidneys; Westermarck, op. cit., II, pp. 363 ff.</page><page sequence="9">[9] THEOPHANIES IN HOLY PLACES IN HEBREW RELIGION 99 wrestled with Jacob was Yahweh, who blessed the patriarch and gave him a new name, indicating the unique relationship of the chosen people to its God. Yahweh appeared to the patriarch in bodily shape; this occurred in the holy place of Peniel. Thus in its present form this narrative, too, is to be grouped among the stories of theophanies in the holy place. In In the introductory passage of chapter 26, which contains the description of Isaac's sojourn in Gerar, the kingdom of Abimelech, because of a famine in Palestine, there are elements of a different origin. In one tradition it was said that the migration of Isaac to a foreign country was caused by a theophany: "Yahweh appeared to him (וירא אליו יהיה) and said, 'Do not go down to Egypt; settle down in in the land which I shall tell you' " (cf. the similar expression in Gen. 12:1). As the scene of the theophany we have to consider Beer laljai-roi or Beer-sheba (Gen. 24:62; 25:11; 26:23; 46:1), both well known cult places. According to another tradition, Isaac had a reve lation in the land of Gerar in which it was said to him, "Sojourn in this land (Gerar), and I will be with you and bless you." How this revelation was understood by the traditionist we do not know (per haps it was thought of as a dream). But the first-mentioned theophany we have to class among theophanies in the holy place.15 The same is possibly true of the vision briefly mentioned in v. 24. The core of the present Sinai narrative in Exod. 19 ff. is the magnificent theophany described in 19:16 ff. Yahweh, the God of the sacred mountain of Sinai, on which according to the oldest belief He was dwelling, and upon which according to a later concept He de scendedscendedscended from heaven, came down upon the top of the mountain in fire and smoke. There were thunder and lightning and a thick cloud, and the whole mountain quaked violently. Moses spoke and God answered him in thunder. To this great theophany others of a different origin are associated. In 24:9-11 it is told that Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up to the top, and they saw (ויראו) the God of Israel, and there was under His feet, as it were, a pavement of sapphire stone. He did not lay His hand on these chief men of the people; they beheld (ויחזו) God, and ate and drank, i.e., they celebrated a ritual meal. In Num. 12:8 it is 15 The collector's hand is perceptible at the beginning and the end of section 1-5. To him we must ascribe the remark that the famine was one besides the former famine, that which had occurred in the days of Abraham, as well as the extension of an originally more concise promise of "these lands" in vv. 3-5. What remains be longed to the material which the collector had at his disposal.</page><page sequence="10">100 JOHANNES LINDBLOM [10] regarded as a privilege of Moses that he beheld the very shape of Yahweh. In Exod. 24:15-18, however, Yahweh's כבוד in the form of a devouring fire settled on the mountain, and a cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day Yahweh called to Moses out of the cloud, and Moses entered the cloud and there he was together with Yahweh. In 33:19 ff., finally, Yahweh's כבוד passed by, while Moses was standing in a crevice of the rock. Yahweh covered him with His hand until He had passed by. Then He took away His hand, and Moses saw His back, because His face could not be seen by mortal men.16 The narrator could not keep to the strict theophany motif through out the whole record of the Sinai occurrences. In many passages he uses the mythological-anthropomorphic style, well-known from the Paradise story and other old stories in the Pentateuch: God speaks to Moses "face to face," and there is a dialogue between Yahweh and Moses as between two human beings, no visionary features at all being suggested. This is the case, for instance, in 19:3-13,21-25; 24:1 f-&gt; 12 f-l 32:7-14, 31-34; 33:1-6. Sometimes (20:1, 22; 25:1, etc.) the phrase "Yahweh spoke to Moses" is nothing but an example of the common law style, well-known from many legal texts in the Pentateuch, particularly in the Priestly Code. In the narrative of the boy Samuel in I Sam. 3 it is told that in the night Samuel lay sleeping in the sanctuary at Shiloh. Three times he heard Yahweh calling him, and each time Samuel arose and went to Eli, the priest, thinking that it was he who had called. What 16 Yahweh's כבוד is here Yahweh in the form of His fiery radiance. The purpose of this appearance of Yahweh was to convince Moses that Yahweh in person would go with Israel on their way to the Promised Land. Barr in his above-mentioned paper strongly emphasizes that the problem in this chapter is how Yahweh could go with Israel in their rebelliousness (cf. G. von Rad, Théologie des Alten Testaments, I [Mtinchen, 1957], pp. 283 f.). Now Moses wanted to know whom Yahweh would send as the leader of this people. Yahweh answered that His "face" (פנים) would go with Moses and the people. This promise should calm Moses's disquietude. Moses was not content with this; he insisted on Yahweh's going with him in person. It seems to me quite clear that פגים is here not identical with Yahweh but a substitute for Him. This is the opinion of Barr, too. Above all Morgenstern has made it evident that in v. 14 Yahweh's פנים is another being than Yahweh Himself (though he identifies the פנים with Yahweh's priest Hobab) ; The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch (Cincinnati, 1927), pp. 4 ff., 43 ff. If it is correct in this way to distinguish between Yahweh and His פנים in v. 14, the formulation of v. 15, according to which Yahweh is apparently identical with His פנים (cf. Deut. 4:37; II Sam. 17:11 ; Isa. 63:9 according to a better text), must derive from another tradition. Or has פני in v. 14 replaced an original סלאכי (cf. Exod. 23:20, 23; 32:34; 33:2; Num. 20:16)? On this difficult pas sage see also Nôtscher, op. cit., pp. 43 ff., where the identity of Yahweh and His פנים is vindicated.</page><page sequence="11">[11] THEOPHANIES IN HOLY PLACES IN HEBREW RELIGION 101 Samuel here experienced is obviously thought to have been a dream; we recognize all the characteristics of a lively dream. The description of the dream is concluded in v. 9. In v. 10 the nightly experiences of Samuel culminate in a real theophany: Yahweh came and stood (ויתיצב) before Samuel and spoke to him about the future of the house of Eli. The apparition of Yahweh is here called המראה (v. 15), the same term which is used in the story of Jacob's dream in Gen. 46:2. The term can also be used of prophetic visions (Num. 12:6; Ezek. 1:1; 8:3, etc.). From the conclusion of the narrative (v. 21) it is, how ever, evident that the narrator regarded the vision of Yahweh which is described in v. 10 as a real theophany, not as an experience obtained in a dream. He says that Yahweh continued to appear (להראה) in Shiloh. It was quite natural for him to think that Shiloh — a sane tuary of the greatest importance — would be a place where theopanies were bestowed on men. There are passages in which a theophany in a holy place is described somewhat differently, so that God is not seen in person but in the shape of a "messenger," called God's or Yahweh's מלאך. The Bible frequently refers to a messenger sent by Yahweh to perform a mis sion and clearly distinguishable from Him." But there are also pas sages in which the מלאך is in some way identical with Yahweh. There מלאך יהוה or מלאך אלהים is, so to speak, the form, the shape in which Yahweh reveals Himself to mortal men, communes with them and speaks to them.18 This is not the place to discuss in detail the origin and meaning of the concept of Yahweh's messenger in this sense. It may, however, be pointed out that wherever the messenger is identical with Yahweh the designations מלאך יהוה or מלאך אלהיט stand as technical terms, almost as proper names, alternating with Yahweh or God, but we never find מלאכי ,המלאך, the indefinite מלאך or the like.19 Professor Aubrey Johnson would explain מלאך יהוה in 17 The passages are collected by W. Baumgartner in "Zum Problem des 'Jahwe Engels,' " Zum Alten Testament und seiner Umwelt. Ausgewâhlte Aufsàtze von Waller Baumgartner Baumgartner (Leiden, 1959), pp. 240 ff. 18 18 This is denied by F. Stier in his work Gott und sein Engel im Alten Testament, AlttestamentlicheAlttestamentliche Abhandlungen, XII, 2 (Munster, i. W., 1934). This scholar thinks that מלאך יהוה is everywhere a messenger from God distinguishable from Him, speaking on His behalf. This is conceivable in passages in which the voice of מלאך יהוה is heard. But in passages in which it is stated that he who has seen מלאך יהוה says that he has seen God or Yahweh, Stier's interpretation seems to be rather forced. 19 The constant repetition of the complete expression מלאך יהוה is particularly noticeable in the stories of Balaam Num. 22:22 ff., and of Gideon Judg. 6:11 ff. In Gen. 48:16 המלאך is a messenger on certain occasions sent by God for redeeming Jacob from evils of all kinds (cf. Gunkel's comment in his Commentary). In Hos.</page><page sequence="12">102 JOHANNES LINDBLOM [12] this specific sense in the terms of the Hebrew concept of the one and the many or as an "extension of Yahweh's personality."20 To me it seems very probable that the figure of מלאך יהוה in the specific sense has its origin in experiences of visions and dreams in which Yahweh appeared to men in human shape. מלאך אלהים in the specific sense is, noticeably enough, seen by Jacob in a dream (Gen. 31:11). The human figure in which God reveals Himself is called מלאך, messenger, because his mission is always to deliver a message, an order, a promise. It is in my opinion beyond dispute that in many cases there is really an identity between Yahweh and מלאך יהוה. This identity is reflected in the fact that in the passages in question there is an oscillation in action and speaking between Yahweh and Yahweh's messenger, so that Yahweh and Yahweh's messenger alternate as subject and object in the same text. For the most part this oscillation cannot be removed (as often has been suggested) by literary or textual operations. In In four passages Yahweh appears in theophanies in holy places in the form of מלאך יהוה: Gen. 16:7 ff.; 22:9 ff.; Exod. 3:2 ff., and Judges 6:11 ff. In the story of Hagar מלאך יהוה appeared to Hagar by the well Beer-lahai-roi, a time-honored holy place in the wilderness south of Palestine. He announces that the woman will bear a son and that her descendants will be greatly multiplied. Then it is said that she called Yahweh, who had spoken to her, "the God of seeing." The identity between Yahweh and מלאך יהוה is here beyond dispute. Thus we may here speak of a theophany which occurred in a holy place where the deity was thought to be present.21 In In Gen. 22:11 ff. מלאך יהוה likewise speaks as if he were Yahweh Himself. The place where the offering occurred is quite obscure, but that it was an ancient cult place is evident, inter alia, from v. 14 and is thus assumed by all biblical scholars. V. 14 proves also that the nar rator had a theophany in view. In the account of the vocation of Moses in Exod. 3 מלאך יהוה, who 12:5 a special tradition is perceptible according to which "the man" (איש) of Gen. 32:25 ff. is regarded as a messenger from God. 20 Op. cit., pp. 32 ff. 21 The conclusion of the narrative I translate in this way: "And she called the name of Yahweh, who spoke to her: 'Thou art a God of seeing,' for she said, 'Have I here really seen the back of Him who has seen me?' Therefore they called the well: 'The well belonging to the Living One who has seen me.' אחרי " in v. 13 is to be taken as a substantive (cf. Exod. 33:8; II Sam. 2:23, and אחרי Exod. 33:23). מלאך יהוה was Yahweh in bodily manifestation, not Yahweh in His essence. For this reason it is said that Hagar had seen "the back" of Yahweh.</page><page sequence="13">[13] THEOPHANIES IN HOLY PLACES IN HEBREW RELIGION 103 appeared (וירא) to Moses in the burning bush on Mount Sinai, is obviously thought of as identical with Yahweh. It is said: "God called to him out of the bush . . . And He said, 'I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' " And further: "Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God." Here God reveals Himself in מלאך יהוה and speaks through his mouth. The theophany took place in the holy mountain of Sinai, where Yahweh was dwelling (cf. 3:16; 4:5). מלאך יהוה who according to Judges 6 came to Gideon at Ophra was manifestly conceived of as identical with Yahweh. After saying that מלאך יהוה spoke to Gideon and that Gideon answered him, the narrative goes on: "And Yahweh turned to him (Gideon) and said, 'Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Surely I send you.' " Next it is said that Yahweh spoke to Gideon. Yahweh said, "I will be with you and you shall smite the Midianites." Thereafter מלאך ירוה received the offering presented to him by Gideon. Then מלאך יהוה vanished from the sight of Gideon. Gideon feared be cause he had seen מלאך יהוה face to face. But — so the narrative runs — Yahweh said to him, "Shalom be to you; do not fear, you shall not die." The altar which Gideon built to Yahweh was called Yahweh is shalom."shalom." Of Ophra we know that it was of old a renowned cult place. In the light of the accounts which we have examined above, some passages in the Psalter are more easily understandable. As is well known, some of the psalms have been regarded as incubation-rituals. A few words may here be said about the question of what has been called "incubation" in the Bible. By the term "incubation-dream" we usually mean dreams which men intentionally tried to bring about by lying down to sleep in a sanctuary. In such dreams, often evoked by certain rites, the deity was expected to approach the dreamer and impart to him the knowledge wanted or, particularly, prescribe health giving remedies, or even heal diseases from which he suffered." In several biblical passages scholars have found references to such dreams: Gen. 15; 28:10 ff.; 46:1 ff.; I Sam. 3:1 ff.; I Kings 3:4 ff.; Ps. 3:6; 4:9; 17:15. In the Genesis passages the patriarchs are said to have had revelatory dreams in holy places, but there is no hint that they went to the holy place for the purpose of having a dream. The dream 2222 About incubation-dreams outside the Bible see the above-mentioned works by Hamilton, Ehrlich, and Oppenheim. Some biblical scholars call every case of dreaming in a sanctuary "incubation." This is misleading. Oppenheim distinguishes between "unintentional" and "provoked" incubation-dreams (op. cit., pp. 187!.). Here I use the term "incubation" in the latter sense.</page><page sequence="14">104 JOHANNES LINDBLOM [14] came while they were by chance sleeping in the holy place. The same is true of the dream which the boy Samuel had in the sanctuary in Shiloh. Ehrlich, who pays much attention to incubation-dreams in the Bible, as well as in the ancient world outside Israel, examines thoroughly the story of King Solomon's dream in Gibeon (I Kings 3) and arrives at the conclusion that we have here "the most perfect incubation in the Old Testament." Solomon, Ehrlich says, went to the sanctuary in Gibeon in order to receive an oracle in an incubation dream.23 The same author frequently emphasizes the fact that in cubation-dreams were intentionally sought for. In this he is right. But where in this narrative is it said that Solomon's intention, when he went to Gibeon, was to receive a dream-oracle? It is only said that the king went to Gibeon in order to perform certain sacrifices. While he was sojourning there, Yahweh appeared to him in a dream by night. In In the dream a dialogue between Solomon and Yahweh took place, ending with great promises for the future of the king. I cannot find that this dream differs from other dreams in biblical reports in which God appears to men and a dialogue between God and the dreamer takes place. In Ps. 4:9 the poet says, "In peace I both lie down and sleep, for Thou, O Yahweh, makest me dwell in safety." This is only an expression of the feeling of safety which the pious man experiences in all vicissitudes of life. To find here a reference to an incubation would be highly far-fetched. The situation is different in Ps. 3. In his distress he who speaks in the psalm has cried to Yahweh, and Yahweh has answered him "from His holy mountain," i. e., from the temple house, or, perhaps, the holy of holies. In what way has the answer been given? This is said in the following verse: "I lay down and fell asleep. I awoke again." He has during his sleep in the courtyard of the temple received a propitious answer, for now he can confess: "I am not afraid of myriads of people who have set themselves against me round about." Here it is natural, indeed, to think of an incubation-oracle imparted in an incubation dream. Thus the psalm was recited in the morning after the incubation sleep.24 According to my present view Ps. 17 deals with an incubation, but 23 Ehrlich, op. cit., pp. 19 ff. 24 אקרא (v. 5) is used in an iterative sense; ויענני alludes to a certain historical occurence. The sentence "for Yahweh sustains me" bears on the whole content of vv. 5-6. The expression "His holy mountain" refers possibly, as H. Schmidt suggests, to the most holy place of the sanctuary, where Yahweh dwelled (cf. H. Schmidt, Die Die Psalmen [in Eissfeldt's Handbuch zum Alien Testament], and Der Heilige Fels in Jerusalem [Tubingen, 1933], pp. 89 ff.).</page><page sequence="15">[15] THEOPHANIES IN HOLY PLACES IN HEBREW RELIGION 105 an incubation which did not lead to a dream-oracle, but rather to a real theophany. In v. 15 the poet says, "I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; awakening I shall be sated with Thy form." The com mentators have had difficulty in finding a plausible explanation of the expression "awakening" (בהקיץ). Some of them think of the resurrec tion from the dead, others of liberation from distress, still others of awakening in the morning from an ordinary nocturnal sleep; others again change the text. In an article in ZAW, LIX, 1942/43, pp. 1 ff., in which I examined Ps. 17, I suggested that the morning, when the awakening occurred, is here considered as the time when God used to intervene for the benefit of His worshippers. I supported this view by many examples. The phrase "I shall behold Thy face, I shall be sated with Thy form," I explained in analogy with many passages in the Bible in which "see God" means experience God's propitious intervention, God's help and salvation. Much indicates, however, that the poet is here thinking of an awakening from an incubation-sleep. The situation of the Psalm is that a pious man, who is seriously persecuted by his enemies, has come to the sanctuary in order to be informed that he was innocent and that he would be saved by God from his affliction. In this case he did not expect a dream-oracle but something more than that: he expected to wake up from his sleep and experience a real theophany. Favored with the wondrous experi ence of beholding God face to face he would feel assured that his case was just and that he would be saved by God. It might perhaps be objected that the only word "awake" is insufficient for characterizing the Psalm as a ritual preparation for an incubation-sleep. But what we do not find in the text was, of course, completed by the Sitz im LebenLeben of the Psalm, recited as it was as a liturgical introduction to the following ritual act.25 One may feel tempted to explain Ps. 63:3 in the same way. The poet, who in his distress "thirsts" for Yahweh's help, expresses his belief that in the temple he will surely see (יתיך m perf. conjidentiae) " Among the representatives of the hypothesis that psalms 3, 4, and 17 refer to incubation-sleep we should particularly refer to S. Mowinckel, Psalmenstudien, I (Kristiania, 1921), pp. 154. ff.; H. Birkeland, Die Feinde des Individuums in der israelitischenisraelitischen Psalmenliteratur (Oslo, 1933), pp. 335 f., and G. Widengren, The AccadianAccadian and Hebrew Psalms of Lamentation as Religious Documents (Uppsala, 1936), pp. 28, 256 f., 263, 291. Gunkel in his Commentary on the Psalms entirely rejects Mowinckel's suggestions. Among modern commentators there is no agreement. The last commentator on the Psalms, H.-J. Kraus, sees in 3:6, and 4:9 expressions of con fidence in Yahweh's protection, whereas in 17:15 he finds an indication of a theophany in the sense of Isa. 6, experienced in the sanctuary after a night of divine trial (in Biblischer Kommentar. Altes Testament, Neukirchen Kr. Moers).</page><page sequence="16">106 JOHANNES LINDBLOM [16] Yahweh, experiencing Yahweh's power and glory. The passage be comes quite clear if we here assume a reference to a theophany in the holy place.26 In the different reports of theophanies we hear little about the form in in which God appeared. However, both the idea of מלאך יהוה and the statement that Yahweh came and stood before him who beheld the theophany prove that Yahweh could be seen in human shape. In the account of Jacob's [wrestling with God in Gen. 32, as well as in the narrative of the visit of the three men to Abraham in Gen. 18, the deity is obviously imagined as a man with bodily features. The appear ance of Yahweh in Isaiah's inaugural vision was that of a king, though the individual traits were not seen by human eyes. Even in the theophany on Mount Sinai some bodily features shine through (Exod. 33:22 ff.). In most cases what was heard in the theophany was regarded as more important than what was seen.27 Theophanies in holy places are referred to in all biblical sources and in all periods of Israelite history. That not only the great and leading personalities in the past were favored with theophanies is evident from the story of Hagar as well as from individual psalms, in which we find indications of theophanies. This would hardly have been the case if such experiences had not frequently taken place in real life. It is psychologically well understandable that under the influence of the sanctity of a holy place, and conscious of the presence of the Deity, a visitor was powerfully conditioned not only to have significant dreams but also to have visionary experiences. The theophanies which we have examined in this article are not to be confounded with the ecstatic visions of the prophets nor with dream visions: they were rather hallucinatory experiences with many analogies at all stages of human life. A good deal of the biblical reports may be leg endary, some of them may even have been transmitted as pure cult legends, but this does not nullify the fact that experiences of this kind may really have occurred. To those who had such experiences the reality of Yahweh's presence and appearance in person was of course beyond all doubt. 26 Possibly the author in II Chron. 3:1 has thought of a theophany bestowed on David on the holy Mount Moriah. Whether II Chron. 7:12 refers to a theophany or a dream is doubtful. Ps. 11:7 and similar passages in the Psalter bear only on visits to the sanctuary or, more generally, on experiences of God's helpful intervention in the life of the righteous. The theophany from Zion which is described in Ps. 50 is not real but liturgic-poetical. 27 On the question of the anthropomorphic form of the theophanies see further the above-mentioned paper by Barr.</page></plain_text>
