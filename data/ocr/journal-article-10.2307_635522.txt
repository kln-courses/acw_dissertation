The President, Sir Crispin Tickell, in the Chair. The Honorary Secretary, Dr A. French read the Minutes of the last Annual General Meeting and these were approved and signed. The President then gave his Address (see page 326). This was followed by the presentation of Royal Medals and Awards. The PRESIDENT: We now come to the most interes- ting parts of this afternoon's business, the pres- entation of Medals and Awards. We begin with the Awards for Honorary Membership and Fellowship. Honorary Membership: SIR VIVIAN FUCHS Honorary Membership of the RGS is a rare distinction, given 'to mark outstanding services to public life and to international affairs that merit recognition by the Society'. We are awarding Honorary Membership to our past President, Sir Vivian Fuchs. After early expeditions in Greenland and East Africa, Sir Vivian turned his attention to Antarctica. He was leader of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey and then in 1955-8 led the famous Com- monwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition that made the first crossing of the southern continent. His great contribution to polar studies also came from 15 years as Director of the British Antarctic Survey. He has received our Founder's Medal and our Special Gold Medal, as well as a great many medals and honours from other societies. Honorary Fellowship: PROFESSOR GORDON EAST and PROFESSOR NORMAN PYE Honorary Fellowship is granted to persons who have rendered conspicuous services to the cause of Geography or the work of the Society. This year we have two new Honorary Fellows, Professor Gordon East and Professor Norman Pye. Emeritus Professor East was Professor of Ge- ography at Birkbeck College, London for 23 years, from 1947 to 1970. Before that he taught at the University of London and was visiting Professor at a number of American universities. His many books range from historical geography to the theory of geography, and from the Mediterranean to the Meetings: Session 1991-1992</page><page sequence="2">354 MEETINGS: SESSION 1991-1992 Soviet Union and Great Britain. Professor East received our Murchison Award and served on the RGS Council. Professor Norman Pye was Professor of Geogra- phy at the University of Leicester for 25 years from 1954 to 1979, and during part of this time served as Pro-Vice-Chancellor. He has also been active in overseas universities in Canada, Ghana, East Africa and Guyana. Professor Pye was on expeditions to very different climates: Spitzbergen and the Sonora Desert. He has been a splendidly active member of the RGS Council and on many other geogiaphical bodies, and still does much work for our Education Committee. Honorary Corresponding Member: PROFESSOR AKIN MABOGUNJE We are also appointing an Honorary Corresponding Member, Professor Akin Mabogunje of the University oflbadan, Nigeria. After obtaining his doctorate at University College, London, Pro- fessor Mabogunje has taught at the University of Ibadan for the past 33 years, most of them as Professor of Geography. His personal research interests range from migration and urbanization to regional development. He succeeded our past President, Professor Michael Wise, in the highest position available to academic geographers: as President of the International Geographical Union, from 1980 to 1984. Professor Mabogunje has taught in many universities, in the United States, Canada, Sweden and Brazil, and he has received many honours, including our own Murchison Award. Sadly, Professor Mabogunje cannot be with us today, but Mr S. A. Ibi, who is a Minister at the Nigerian High Commission, has kindly agreed to accept the Honorary Corresponding Membership on his behalf. This year, we are issuing one of our rare Special Medals to the Ordnance Survey 'for two centuries of contributions to surveying and cartography'. As we heard at the conference about the Ordnance Survey, held here a fortnight ago, it is unquestion- ably one of the world's greatest mapping establish- ments. The Ordnance Survey has pioneered many innovations in science and technology. It has also achieved a massive output of maps and plans essential to the nation. Suffice it to say that Great Britain is perhaps the best mapped country in the world, thanks to the Ordnance Survey. That great organization also remains at the forefront of new developments with its programme of digitized mapping, its use of new technology, and its research. There are many links between the OS and this Society. The longest-serving Director of the Survey, Major General Thomas Colby who ran it from 1820 to 1847, was also one of the founders of the RGS in 1830. Another later Director-General of the Ord- nance Survey, Sir Charles Close, was President of this Society in 1930 when we celebrated our centenary and built this Lecture Theatre. Five Director-Generals of the OS have been awarded our Gold Medal and almost every Director-General has served on our Council. We are therefore close friends of the Ordnance Survey and it is a particular pleasure to award this Special Medal to its Director- General, Peter McMaster. Mr PETER McMASTER: President, My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. I would, most sincerely, like to thank the Society on behalf of all Ordnance Survey staff, for this award. The President has referred to the long association between the Society and Ordnance Survey, and that is an association which is much valued by Ordnance Survey. The Society and the Department have a common concern for the best interests of British mapping and over many years Ordnance Survey has had cause to be grateful for the support which the Society has given before many Commis- sions and Committees of Enquiry. This has been a great strength to Ordnance Survey and has been vital for ensuring the continuation of good mapping in Britain. I am particularly happy about the timing of this presentation, for it enables me to report this occasion, and to display this fine medal, at our Retired Staffs Open Day in a fortnight's time. I think it very appropriate that I should be able to pay tribute with this generous award to those who have gone before us, and to whom we, the present staff, owe so much. President, I know that all staff, past and present, of the Ordnance Survey will feel greatly honoured by this award. Thank you very much. The PRESIDENT: The Queen has approved the award of the Patron's Medal, which ranks equally with the Founder's Medal, jointly to Dr Helge and Dr Anne Ingstad, for research on the European discovery of North America. Dr Helge Ingstad started his career as a lawyer, but then spent a number of years as the Norwegian Governor of North-East Greenland and then of Spitzbergen (Svalbard). He undertook ethno- graphic studies of Apache Indians in the United States and of an Inuit group in Alaska. However, the Ingstad's greatest achievement was in their eight archaeological expeditions to Greenland, Newfoundland and other parts of northern Canada to study traces of old Norse settlements. In 1960, after a long search, at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland, they discovered and excavated the only definitely authenticated Norse site in the Americas, dating from about AD 1000. It</page><page sequence="3">MEETINGS: SESSION 1991-1992 355 is appropriate that this Society should honour such a remarkable discovery in the year before the world celebrates the fifth centenary of Columbus' much later discovery of America. This medal is awarded jointly, since Dr Anne Ingstad was the archaeologist who worked with her husband on all these Norse expeditions and directed the archaeological work on them. Dr HELGE INGSTAD: President, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. My wife and I are greatly honoured to be here today and receive the Patron's Medal for research on the European discovery of North America. This research has lasted many years in cooperation with many, from the fishermen of Newfoundland to scholars from many countries. I am extremely grateful to them all. I have been deeply interested in the Norse expansion in the Arctic and the sub-Arctic during the Viking Age. Particularly, I have been interested in the problem of the Norse discovery of America as told in the Icelandic sagas. This problem has been discussed to a great extent in this literature for nearly three hundred years. The sagas state that grapes were found in Vinland, and therefore it has been commonly held that Vinland must lie in a region with wild grapes, far in the south. A number of regions have been proposed, such as Massachu- setts, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia, but no trace of any Norsemen has been found there. I believed that everything about grapes in the sagas was a later unhistoric addition, and that Vinland should be looked for in Newfoundland. My opinion was based on different reasons, one of them being a different interpretation of the sagas. In 1960 I investigated the coast of Newfoundland from the sea and from the air. And at last I was lucky. On the northern coast in a region called L'Anse aux Meadows I met a sterling fisherman by the name of George Decker. He showed me some very low and overgrown remains of house sites. They could have derived from Indians, Eskimos, whalers and fisher- men or from Norsemen. Only excavations could give the answer. In the period 1961-8 I led seven archaeological expeditions during which the sites at L'Anse aux Meadows were excavated. Scholars from Canada, USA, Iceland, Sweden and Norway took part. My wife -Anne Stine - was in charge of the archae- ological work throughout those years. Eight house sites were excavated, some fairly large - up to 24 metres. They were entirely built of turf and related to house sites known in Norway, Iceland and Greenland from the Viking Age about AD 1000. Of particular interest was the discovery of a smithy connected with the production of iron from bog-iron, a typical Norse process. Furthermore, some interesting Norse artifacts came to light- I can only mention a spindle-whorl of soapstone and a ringheaded pin of bronze. According to a series of radio-carbon analyses, the settlement dates from about AD 1000, the time of Leif Eiriksson's Vinland voyage, according to the sagas. Today it is generally accepted that the site at L'Anse aux Meadows is a Norse settlement. The Canadian Government has declared the whole area a National Park and built a Viking Museum there. Today it is a popular tourist attraction. The good results from the excavations at L'Anse aux Meadows are a product of cooperation. I am grateful to so many scientists who worked with us, and I would also extend my thanks to the Canadian Government and to the Memorial University of Newfoundland - the work was carried out in close and congenial cooperation with them. Finally, may I again express our sincere thanks and gratitude to the Royal Geographical Society for the honour that has been bestowed upon us here today. The PRESIDENT: Her Majesty The Queen has approved the award of our Founder's Medal to Professor Andrew Goudie of the University of Oxford for 'contributions to geomorphology'. Although Andrew Goudie obtained his doctorate at Cambridge, he has taught at Oxford since 1970, becoming Professor of Geography and Head of Department in 1984. His career is an admirable blend of intellectual academic output and arduous fieldwork. He is author of 16 books and over 100 papers. The titles of his most notable books indicate the range of Professor Goudie's interests: Geomor- phology of Deserts, The Geomorphology of England and Wales, Environmental Change, The Human Impact, and The Nature of the Environment. Apart from running an excellent department and all his written output, Andrew Goudie is a most energetic expeditioner who has conducted field research in remote places almost every year for the past 20 years. He has worked in Swaziland, Namibia and Pakistan as well as in many other countries. He was deputy leader of this Society's Karakoram Project in 1980 and also of our Kora Research Project in Kenya in 1983. Most particularly, he led our Kimberley Research Project in Western Australia in 1988, and this proved to be a model of a multidisciplinary project that achieved excellent results in quite difficult terrain. Andrew Goudie's links with this Society are manifold, including being an Honorary Secretary from 1980 to 1988, a Vice- President, and Chairman of the Science and Public Policy Committee (formerly the Research Com- mittee). He has also been Chairman of the British Geomorphological Research Group and is an Honorary Vice-President of the Geological As- sociation.</page><page sequence="4">356 MEETINGS: SESSION 1991-1992 Professor A. s. GOUDIE: President. My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. One has no right to receive a medal of this importance for doing something that one enjoys so much. Were I not paid to do it, geomorphology would be my hobby, and fieldwork and travels would be leisure-time activities. My parents' love of walking in the Cotswolds converted me to geomorphology and fossil collecting by the age of seven. My school, Dean Close, made sure that I loved Geography and the outdoor life through to university, and even the Combined Cadet Force, with its beastly drills and scratchy battledress, made sure that I could map read. At Cambridge the Groves exposed me to glaciers and raclette, and David Stoddart (ebullient of Berkeley) exposed me to Norfolk salt marshes and wild duck sandwiches. Their geography was not that of Conrad's experience, 'a bloodless thing with a dry skin covering a repulsive armature of uninteresting bones'. The contribution that these three Cambridge tutors have made over the years to rearing geographers who believed in fieldwork, scientific exploration and coping with wild environ- ments, cannot be underestimated. Cambridge, in those more enlightened days, exposed one to horizons beyond Watford and the Weald. Since then in the charming and experienced company of Dick Grove, David Price Williams, the Allchins, Karunakara Hegde and those professional geomorphological impresarios, Cooke, Jones, Brunsden, Doornkamp and Warren, I have trav- elled some of the world's deserts and bushlands. Most recently of all, I have travelled and worked with my wife, Heather. We took our honeymoon in the Namib Desert and produced our first daughter in the Kimberleys. Amy, for her part, is named after a vaguely anthropomorphic twin-peaked granite inselberg, and went into her first tropical cave aged three weeks! I have also enjoyed my RGS connections. Alfred Steers used to say that he liked the RGS because one met ordinary people there- bankers, Admirals, Dukes and the like. These, he found, made a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill aca- demic. I tend to agree with him. It has been a privilege to see the RGS evolve into the exciting and forward-looking body it now is. Above all it has been fun to be involved with some of the major RGS projects, be it as leader, deputy leader or member. The energy of Lord Shackleton and the Bishops in the Kimberley, of Nigel Winser in Wahiba, the Karakorams and the Kimberley, of Keith Miller in the Karakorams and of Malcolm Coe in Kora, has been daunting to emulate and stimulating to observe. Through the friendship and efforts of all the people mentioned I have enjoyed my geography. There have, of course, been down-moments: the insect life of Australia, the snores of one or two of my camp colleagues, the unreliability of one's bowels in certain parts of Asia, but what are these compared to the thrill of one's first Land Rover journey in Africa, the satisfaction of discovering a major archaeological site, or the privilege of contributing to the Queen of Sciences. Receiving this medal adds immeasurably to my enjoyment of the subject, but it has all been such fun, I don't deserve it. The PRESIDENT: This year's Victoria Medal is awarded to Professor John Clarke of the University of Durham. Professor Clarke is Britain's leading population geographer. He has chaired commissions on this subject for the International Geographical Union, the Institute of British Geographers, the International Social Science Council and other bodies, and he was Acting Chairman of the Human Geography Committee of the Social Science Re- search Council. John Clarke obtained his doctorate from the University of Aberdeen, but moved to the University of Durham in 1955. He retired last year after 22 years as Professor of Geography at Durham, including six years as Pro-Vice-Chancellor. Much of the credit for Durham's fine Department of Geography goes to him. Professor Clarke has done fieldwork in many parts of Africa and the Middle East, including two years as a Professor in Sierra Leone and visiting professorships at seven universities in Africa, China, the United States and European countries. His great reputation as a population geographer rests on ten books, nine edited books and over 100 papers. His most important books include Human Geography and Developing Countries ( 1971 ), An Advanced Geography of Africa (1975) and Geography of Populations: Approaches and Applications (1984). Professor JOHN CLARKE: President, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. I am honoured and flattered to be a recipient of the prestigious Victoria Medal, and to be listed in such august company. I am particularly pleased that it is for services to Population Ge- ography, a field that has emerged strongly during my academic life since 1950, influenced no doubt by the fact that world population has more than doubled since then. More remarkable is the reflection that when the Royal Geographical Society was founded in 1830 the world population was only about one billion, less than one-fifth of what it is today and equivalent to only one decade of population increase at current rates. Although the population of Britain was under a third of the present total, it was more than in the whole of North America, because the main waves of European emigration had yet to begin. Few populations had experienced any demographic</page><page sequence="5">MEETINGS: SESSION 1991-1992 357 1971, where he is now Reader and Director of the Applied Tropical Ecology Unit. His bibliography contains over 100 papers, articles and books. Dr JOHN PROCTOR: President, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. I am greatly honoured to be here today as a recipient of the Busk Medal for contributions to forest ecology. Although it is I who am accepting this medal, I do so on behalf of all those who have worked with me. I have to say that I have never worked alone. I have always been dependent on administrators, assistants, fellow scientists and often, and importantly, native people, for help. I had the great fortune to take part in the RGS Mulu Expedition and received vital support during the formative days of that expedition from its leader Robin Hanbury-Tenison. On the expedition itself, I had unstinting help. I must mention three people in particular: Inggan Nilong of Long Terawan, whose grandfather was Shackleton's foreman on his first ascent of Mount Mulu in 1932; Harry Vallack (who was a much better 'busker' than me!); and Sue Fogden, who sorted litter into more fractions and for longer than anyone before. Everyone worked continuously to help the Forest Ecology Group achieve its aims. Ten years later I was given, again by a stroke of good fortune, charge of the Forest Regeneration Group on the RGS Maraca Project. At crucial earlier stages John Hemming, the leader, gave vital support and I had two superb assistants in Jill Thompson and Duncan Scott. Other expeditions between Mulu and Maraca have enjoyed similar efforts on my behalf. Keith Hamylton-Jones led our expedition to Costa Rica and helped in many ways. Angela Heaney was a flawless research assistant in that country and afterwards. In the Philippines, and on Seram in Indonesia, Gill Fairweather has been a tireless helper. You will have gathered from this sample of places in which I have researched that I am a peripatetic sort of rainforest ecologist. This is not entirely because I always have to flee enraged host countries, but it does stem from a genuine belief that we still know little of the variety and hence true con- servation value of most of the world's rainforest. Everywhere I have worked has had important novel features that contradict generalizations. The present fashion is for long-term research at a few key forest sites. I support this trend totally, but at the same time I do feel that the short-term wide- ranging approach has its value. My final acknowledgement is to the RGS, which for me has made both approaches to rainforest research possible and has been of great help at every stage of the work for which this year's Busk Medal has been given. transition from high fertility and mortality, and only one in 30 people in the world lived in towns, compared with two in five today: momentous change during the lifetime of this great Society. Many of the nineteenth-century writings of geographers about population were concerned, often deterministically, with its relationships with the physical environment. Curiously, we are coming full circle. Population Geography has developed world-wide since mid-century, but its content and orientation have varied greatly with the scale and period of analysis, the demographic input and the significance of the physical environment to human activities - particularly strong in less-developed countries. Rising awareness of global environmental change and degradation, identified not least by our President, and the availability of a vast array of satellite data, are stimulating more scientific studies of the complex interrelationships between popu- lation and environment. The challenge is great, and I am fortunate to be able to continue collaboration with overseas colleagues in various international organizations. Of course populations may be studied at a more local level, and as Chairman of the Durham Health Authority I am privileged to indulge in what might be called 'Applied Population Geography', a topic of great fascination though not entirely without political interest, not least to my numerous friends in Durham past and present to whom I owe an immense debt of gratitude. Mr President, I am deeply grateful to the Society, and may I say also that you have greatly pleased my wife, a devotee of Victoriana - my marital status has never been higher! The PRESIDENT: The terms of reference of the Busk Medal now include research and conservation as well as fieldwork abroad in Geography. It is therefore very appropriate that it should go to Dr John Proctor of the Department of Biological and Molecular Sciences at the University of Stirling. John Proctor is probably this country's foremost tropical forest ecologist. He led groups on the two largest research projects that this Society has ever mounted: the Mulu (Sarawak) Expedition of 1977-8 and the Maraca Rainforest Project, Brazil, 1987-8. In each of these he was a tireless field worker who devised imaginative research experi- ments and inspired the teams he led. Dr Proctor has also led other important research projects, including two expeditions to Sabah, two expeditions to the Philippines, one to Costa Rica, and other ex- peditions in Brazil, Indonesia and India. With his network of active students and research programmes throughout the tropical rainforest, it is said that 'The sun never sets on a Proctor project'. John Proctor has taught at the University of Stirling since</page><page sequence="6">358 MEETINGS: SESSION 1991-1992 The following Awards were then made: Cherry Kearton Award to Mr PETER JONES for wildlife films.
