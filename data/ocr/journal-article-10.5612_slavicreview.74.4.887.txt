The ocean and its  inhabitants also shaped the oft en tragic relationship between Russians, Kam- chadals, Aleuts, and other indigenous peoples” (4). Moreover, the North Pa- cifi c was itself undergoing ongoing changes in the eighteenth century due a  variety of hydrological, ecological, and geological factors. The arrival of Rus- sians to the region was just one additional source of environmental instabil- ity. Indeed, the drop in sea-otter populations was not solely the result of hu- man activity. Rather, “complex factors induced these depletions: climate and  sea temperatures shift ed, with the warming trend that occurred around 1790  a potential climatic driver of fur-seal and sea-otter declines” (61). This volume also speaks to the important questions about tsarist Rus- sia as a multiethnic, multiconfessional, and spatially heterogeneous empire.  Russians’ relations with the native peoples of the North Pacifi c were funda- mentally transformed by sea-otter ecosystems, since Russian merchants and  pioneers used (oft en dragooned) Kamchadals, Alutiits, and Aleuts to be the  primary hunters of these fur riches. Their hunting profi ciency, through wa- ters and islands oft en very distant from their homes, proved deadly for the  sea otters and ensured suff ering for these oppressed peoples. Here the eco- logical and biological were intricately interlinked with human ethnocultural  and socioeconomic power structures. The drive for furs was pushed on by  the unquenchable Chinese thirst for the skins, the taxation structures of ya- sak (tribute), unregulated Russian traders and hunters in search of immediate  profi t, and abusive relations with the native peoples of the region. In the end,  as the ocean mammals went, so too did the indigenous peoples of the islands.  As Langsdorff  wrote in melancholic, if hyperbolic, terms to Adam Johann von  Krusenstern in 1807, “Now there are no sea otters, and almost no one left  to  kill them” (99).

Most English speakers have a “conditioned refl ex” when hearing the name  Pavlov to immediately envision a dog salivating at the sound of a bell. Daniel  Todes tells us that the uslovnyi refl eks phenomenon is correctly translated as  “conditional refl ex” and that Ivan Pavlov rarely used stimuli as variable and  imprecise as a bell (another mistranslation, from “buzzer”). Having previ- ously described the work on the digestive system that brought Pavlov Russia’s  fi rst Nobel Prize, in Pavlov’s Physiology Factory: Experiment, Interpretation,  Laboratory, Enterprise (1994), here Todes details the entire 87 years of Pavlov’s  </page> <page sequence="2"> 888 Slavic Review life, with two-thirds of the text devoted to his rise from “mere Nobel Prize  winner to a cultural symbol of twentieth-century science” (265). Emphasizing  the bell “misses the purpose and direction of Pavlov’s research, presenting  as its grand achievement what was merely its point of departure” (287). Pav- lov grappled with the relationship between “physiological and psychological  processes” (297) that remains a crucial realm of investigation and mystery. Todes’s beautifully written account combines a history of science and med- icine with a sweeping social history. The thoroughness of a careful life’s work  comes through in every chapter. When he describes Pavlov’s re- energizing by  spending summers at the family dacha in Estonia, Todes depicts the varieties  of late imperial dacha communities. Anton Chekhov’s descriptions of Russian  life receive as much attention as scientifi c treatises. Todes obeys Pavlov’s in- junction to rejuvenate scientifi c work with attention to other realms. Readers  learn the schedule of local peasants providing victuals and the intricacies of  the popular game gorodki, played by Peter the Great and by Iosif Stalin and  Sergei Kirov. Pavlov was a skilled player who engaged in verbal commentary  bordering on psychological warfare. Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was the eldest son of a Riazan ́ priest, and the  church had been the family vocation for six generations. Educated at the local  seminary, he developed his lifelong interests by reading the thick journals at  Riazan ’ ́s public library, a facility established by Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin  when he served as governor. Pavlov’s choosing medicine and science pro- voked a split with his father that never healed. Pavlov used a ruse “common among seminarians” (42) to enroll at the  Military- Medical Academy in St. Petersburg in 1870. He applied to the Juridi- cal Faculty, passing the exams in history and Russian literature while avoid- ing the math exam required for the Physico-Mathematical Faculty. Ten days  aft er being admitted, Pavlov requested and was granted a transfer to the  Physico-Mathematical Faculty. For nearly two decades aft er graduating, Pav- lov had a remarkably undistinguished career. Todes notes that had he died at  age forty, few would have remembered him. Pavlov had grand aspirations but  poor work habits. This began to change with some private funding, including  a grant from Emanuel Nobel that Russia’s current ruler might well view as the  actions of a “foreign agent.” A year in Leipzig, in 1885–86, helped, but Pavlov  fi nally attained a secure position only in 1890. Pavlov’s spouse shared the travails of these years. Serafi ma Vasil e ́va  Karchevskaia provides an intriguing example of the “emancipated” women  of the 1860s and 1870s becoming family-focused wives and mothers. Hav- ing vowed to share everything when they wed in 1881 (a marriage aided by  her seeking counsel from Fedor Dostoevskii), Pavlov later sought to separate  home and work, telling Serafi ma that “it would be hard for me to also breathe  at home a physiological atmosphere” (131). Serafi ma accepted a friend’s advice  to avoid “imprudently” seeking support from her husband in dealing with  problems because this “would disturb his peaceful pursuit of his scientifi c  work . . . the entire goal of your life” (136). Pavlov’s materialism challenged  Serafi ma’s deep religious convictions, yet she remained by his side despite his  extended aff air with coworker Mariia Petrova. </page> <page sequence="3"> Featured Reviews 889 Pavlov’s research elicited a “tepid” response among Russian physiologists,  but recognition abroad “vaulted him to the forefront of Russian physiology”  (222). Lafayette Mendel’s favorable book review in Science helped. Receiv- ing Russia’s fi rst Nobel Prize made him a phenomenon. In 1904, Pavlov was  awarded the prize for his studies of the digestive system, based on extensive  experiments with dogs. Todes’s chapters on the “physiology factory” describe  a laboratory designed to mass produce scientifi c results based on extensive  experimentation using live animals. Though Pavlov consistently emphasized  the enormous value of keeping the dogs alive to observe results, the number  that succumbed would raise enormous ethical issues for twenty-fi rst-century  practitioners. During the civil war famine, he shift ed focus to studying the ef- fects of hunger on the dogs’ conditional refl exes. The surgery that proved central to Pavlov’s most famous fi nding—that  the psychic signal of food produced salivation—required a procedure that  Todes terms “the ingenious, even diabolical esophagotomy” (154), allowing  experimenters to divert food from the dog’s mouth so that it did not reach the  stomach. While this provided the initial evidence for Pavlov’s hypothesis that  the nervous system generates the signals stimulating salivation, subsequent  perfection of the “tease” method of showing a dog food without allowing it  to eat provided more convincing proof. A dog’s personality was considered  an important element in interpreting research results. The animals get their  own chapter (chapter 13, “Favorite Dogs”), and individual dogs were cred- ited with major fi ndings regarding gastric glands (Druzhok) and the pancreas  (Zhuchka). Plaudits did not satisfy anti-vivisection groups at the turn of the  twentieth century, and they would not assuage animal rights activists today.  Individual dogs with unique personalities appear in many subsequent chap- ters. The dogs became agitated whenever placed on the experimental stand,  leading Pavlov to formulate the “refl ex of freedom.” The question of canine personality versus replicable scientifi c results  looms large. Todes notes more than once that Pavlov considered his long years  of observations to be a “control.” Pavlov’s idea of “objective” research meant,  fi rst, quantifi able data in the form of measurable saliva drops and, second,  that his own interpretation was based on “objective physiological processes”  (289). By the 1930s, he felt he could employ subjective interpretations because  his thirty years of experience made it possible for him to interpret phenom- ena. He could understand the dogs, and if they could speak, they would have  added little. Todes’s description of Pavlov’s domination of his lab suggests a Russian  style of scientifi c management presaging the Soviet era: a patriarchal leader  presiding over the work of colleagues, assistants, and students, tolerating few  alternatives or deviations. This is a direct precursor to the system of scientifi c  schools based on dominant leading fi gures and total control by directors at  the Academy of Science institutes. Pavlov did entertain alternative explana- tions based on data, but it took a brave junior researcher to endure the shout- ing and criticism that inevitably resulted from questioning the great man’s  interpretations. Revolutions inevitably change things. The chapter on the civil war follow- </page> <page sequence="4"> 890 Slavic Review ing the Bolshevik seizure of power, appropriately titled “Cataclysm,” is a mov- ing and compelling account of the human cost of those years, when one-third  of the academy’s members perished. But by 1920, Vladimir Lenin had begun  to pay attention. As Russia’s only Nobel laureate, Pavlov developed a complex  and contradictory relationship with Soviet authorities: “It entailed mutual  acrimony and outright combat, cooperation in their mutual goal of facilitat- ing his scientifi c research, and attempts by each to win over the other” (595).  When a party delegation visited Kirov to complain about Pavlov’s behavior,  he responded that he could not help. If international recognition made Pavlov  an icon in Russia, his vitality and willingness to criticize the Bolsheviks made  him a hero in Europe and America, even when his scientifi c pronouncements  defi ed comprehension. Even a scholar as careful and thorough as Todes leaves out a few things.  He omits Mikhail Bulgakov modeling Professor Preobrazhenskii, the canine  experimenter in Heart of a Dog, on Pavlov. Kendall Bailes’s biography of Vla- dimir Vernadskii provides another example of a prominent Russian scientist  who found that the Bolsheviks would support his work (on the biosphere) at a  level far exceeding what any western source was prepared to off er. Todes might have off ered more thoughts on what Pavlov’s career tells us  about Russian and Soviet science. This reviewer’s list would include “inherited  characteristics” from the prerevolutionary era, in particular, the “great man”  tradition of “scientifi c schools”; emphasis on theory, due in part to inadequate  equipment; the sometimes crucial role of private funding; and politically in- fl uenced choices of topics and approaches. Pavlov’s empire demonstrates that  priority constituted the key resource for support in Soviet science: his lab got  heat by receiving the entire allocation for his institute. This masterful volume is the defi nitive study of a unique fi gure whose  life and work reveal a tremendous amount about science and Russian society.  Todes tells the story with loving care and careful analysis. Several times he  characterizes Pavlov’s research as a “journey to the horizon.” Pavlov’s “holy  grail” was the integration of physiological and psychological processes. The  quest lasted three decades, in which “he discovered much of interest along the  way—facts, methodologies, relationships, and insights of enduring value—but  the ultimate destination continually receded behind an endless landscape of  new and perplexing complexities” (300). Each time, Pavov’s response was  more experiments and more variables, which meant “his explanations con- tinually expanded in scope at the cost of precision and refutability” (301). Did chasing the horizon justify the cost? Pavlov himself sometimes  doubted. Todes notes that aft er World War II, Pavlov appeared “hopelessly  old-fashioned.” However, “his scientifi c practices now seem in many ways  quite modern—quite compatible with contemporary scientists’ attention to  personality types among animals, their attempts to divine the goings-on in  the minds of dogs and dolphins, and the mechanical and anthropomorphic  metaphors they employ to do so” (730).
