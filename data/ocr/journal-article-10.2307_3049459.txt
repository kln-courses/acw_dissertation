<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Identity of the Central Deity on the Aztec Calendar Stone* Cecelia F. Klein Of the extant artistic monuments created by the Aztecs of Pre-Columbian Mexico, the Aztec Calendar Stone is un- doubtedly the most important (Fig. I). The thirteen-and-a- half foot circular polychromed basalt relief has been used to illustrate Postclassic Mexican cosmological concepts and the nature of their manifestation in Postclassic visual art more often than any other single image of the period.1 Discovered in 1790 lying face down in the Plaza Mayor of Mexico City (formerly the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan), and seen today in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City, the Calendar Stone has, further, come to symbolize for the Mexican people the beauty and complexity of their Pre- Columbian heritage. Given its dual role as a national sym- bol and a key to scholarly understanding of Postclassic art and cosmology, it is critically important that the icono- graphy of the Calendar Stone be fully comprehended. The fundamental meaning of the Aztec Calendar Stone has been understood for some time. Scholars have typically accepted the interpretations offered by Eduard Seler and Hermann Beyer who are in essential agreement on the matter.2 According to them, the Calendar Stone functioned as a graphic symbol of the Postclassic concept of cyclical time and space.3 This theory is based on the form of the carving itself, which depicts a giant disk with pointed pro- jections that in standard Postclassic iconography invariably represents the sun. The rim of the stone takes the form of two serpents meeting at tails and heads; they are typically identified as Xiuhcoatls, or Fire Serpents, mythological creatures who symbolize the twenty-four-hour course of the sun through the daytime sky and the earth at night. An inner ring contains all twenty day-signs of the Aztec cal- endar.4 In the center of the reliefs there appear the frontal, or enface, face and hands of what is certainly a deity; these are enframed by the six-lobed Postclassic graphic symbol for the word Ollin, which means "earth," "movement," or "earthquake." The Ollin sign is accompanied by four small circles that convert it into the date naui ollin, 4 Ollin, or "4 Earthquake." In each of the four angles of the Ollin sign there is an image that similarly refers to a specific date in the Aztec calendar. In connection with this imagery Seler and Beyer point out that the Aztecs believed that the universe had passed through four cyclical epochs, each of which had had its own sun. Each of these epochs or "suns" had been violently destroyed at the end of a fifty-two-year cycle, or Aztec "century." The Aztecs themselves, on the eve of the Spanish Conquest in the early sixteenth century, were living in the fifth and last epoch or "sun" and believed that it too would be destroyed, thereby obliterating both man and his uni- verse for all time. This present sun, whose name was naui ollin, 4 Ollin, was expected to be destroyed by earthquakes again at the end of an unspecified Aztec "century" of fifty- two years.5 Since the date 4 Ollin appears on the Calendar Stone relief, and since the four dates located in the four * This article is a version of a paper presented to the Columbia Uni- versity Seminar on Primitive and Pre-Columbian Art, 15 February 1974. It is based on a portion of my doctoral dissertation.

The latter roughly covers the years between A.D. 9oo and 152I, the year of the Spanish Conquest. At the time of the Con- quest, most of central Mexico was under the control of the Aztecs, a Nahuatl-speaking people who rose to power in the i 4th century during what is known as the Late Postclassic period. The Aztec Calendar Stone was carved by these people to sit atop their major ceremonial plaza where it presumably served in some way in the performance of Aztec rituals. The exact orientation and function of the monument have never been ascertained. 2 E. Seler, Disertacidnes, trans. D. de Le6n, Mexico City, M.M.S.S. del Museo Nacional, 1903, vr, If, and Gesammelte Abhandlungen, II, 796-99; Beyer. See also Caso, 1958, 33, for a more recent presentation of the same interpretation. 3 Recent dissenting points of view are put forth by Aviles-Solares and R. Noriega, 221-242. While the two authors disagree in their identifica- tion of the various astronomical cycles and symbols represented, both conclude that the Aztec Calendar Stone was an astronomical calculating device used to compute time. Curiously, neither dissents from the trad- itional identification of the central figure challenged in this article. 4 The Aztecs used two calendars that functioned independently but that ended on the same day every fifty-two years. The first, the xihuitl, was an agricultural calendar based on the 365-day rotation of the earth around the sun. It was divided into eighteen months of twenty days each with an additional five days (nemontemi) at the end. The second, the tonalpohualli, was a divinatory calendar based on the meshing of an invariable series of twenty day-signs with a series of the numerals one through thirteen; each combination of day-sign and numeral could occur only once in 260 days. The 26o-day cycle was divided into twenty periods, or "weeks," of thirteen days each. A larger cycle of fifty-two years, known as the xiuhmolpilli, always ended on a day that simultan- eously concluded both a 365-day and a 26o-day cycle. The xiuhmolpilli was itself divided into quarters and was of the greatest cosmic and ritual significance. 5 Owing to the nature of the Aztec calendar, the solar year, and thus the fifty-two year cycle, could never have ended on the day 4 Ollin. It is therefore not clear how the Aztecs related their fear of the day 4 Ollin to the end of their fifty-two year "century." The date 4 Ollin would have occurred at least once every solar year, however, and events of that day may have been interpreted as prophesies or determinants of the fate of the sun at the end of the current fifty-two year cycle. The association of the day Ollin with the end of a fifty-two year cycle may also derive from the earlier use in many parts of Mesoamerica of an Ehecatl-Mazatl- Malinalli-Ollin set of yearbearers. Such a system survived until the Con- quest in parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero. If the names of the years, and hence the yearbearers themselves, were derived from the last day of the year, as Caso suggests, then the last day of the fifty-two year cycle would have always fallen on a day Ollin (see Caso, I967, 128).</page><page sequence="2">2 THE ART BULLETIN x Aztec Calendar Stone. Mexico City, Museo Nacional de Antropologia (photo: Museum) angles of the Ollin sign are the exact dates of the destruction of the four previous "suns," Seler and Beyer safely conclude that the monument is a graphic symbol of the Aztec concept of the five mythological solar epochs and the end of the world.6 We know, however, that fear of the cataclysmic destruc- tion of the fifth and final sun, naui ollin, led the Aztecs to hold elaborate vigils and rituals at the end of every fifty-two-year cycle, proceedings designed to stave off the disaster. These vigils took place around midnight when the appearance of a particular constellation and star at the center of the night sky guaranteed that the sun would rise as usual at the eastern horizon at dawn and that life would continue for at least another fifty-two years. The anticipated destruction of the sun was therefore apparently expected to take place at night, at which time it was believed to be dead and hidden in the underworld at the navel of the female earth goddess Tlaltecuhtli who systematically "devoured" it each day at sunset. Only proper ritual and sacrifice could insure that the sun would be "reborn" in the east in the morning to pursue its important travels across the sky. The navel of the earth, moreover, was located at the center of the universe. The Aztecs divided both space and time into segments corresponding to the five world direc- tions and arranged them in a cyclic sequence that ran east, north, west, south, and center. The east and north were associated with sunrise and noon, and thus the sky by day; the west, south, and center were associated with sunset and 6 The dates of destruction and hence the names of the five mythological suns cited on the Aztec Calendar Stone are those mentioned in the Leyenda de los soles and the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas; other accounts give different names and/or sequences. Those seen on the Calendar Stone are: (I) 4 Ocelotl, "4 Tiger"; (2) 4 Ehecatl, "4 Wind"; (3) 4 Quiauhtl, "4 Rain"; (4) 4 Atl, "4 Water"; and (5) 4 Ollin, "4 Earthquake" or "4 Movement."

The south and center in particular were associated with the precise moment of midnight and the underworld; it was at this time and in these regions that all Postclassic cosmic cycles came to an end.7 Accordingly, since each of the five mythological solar epochs referred to on the Aztec Calendar Stone were similarly assigned to a particular direction in the traditional sequence, the fifth and final sun, naui ollin, fell to the center. It is clear, therefore, that, in referring to the anticipated destruction of the fifth sun at the end of the entire Aztec spatio-temporal cycle, the Aztec Calendar Stone specifi- cally alludes to midnight, the earth, death, and the center of the world. In view of these additional implications, the identity of the deity represented enface at the very center of the Calen- dar Stone relief becomes increasingly problematic. Scholars have traditionally identified this deity as Tonatiuh, an Aztec sun god, an identification that on first analysis would seem appropriate within the context of the solar disk and refer- ences to the five mythological solar epochs. Tonatiuh, how- ever, like all Aztec deities, had specific functions and con- notations, and these functions and connotations are in fact incompatible with the cosmological context of the stone. Tonatiuh was a god of the day sky, not of the night sky and the earth, and he was invariably associated with the world direction of the east in the Postclassic calendar and codices. Since death and destruction, like the earth and darkness, were associated with the world directions of west, south, and center in Postclassic cosmology, Tonatiuh's affiliation with the east dissociates him from these concepts as well. To identify the central deity of the Aztec Calendar Stone as Tonatiuh is therefore to locate a god of the east, and thus of the beginning of cosmic cycles, of daylight, of the sky and life itself, within a context of cosmic destruction and com- pletion at midnight at the dark center of the earth. In short, to accept this identification is to cast the consistency of the Postclassic mind into disrepute. The deity represented at the center of the Aztec Calendar Stone is not, however, Tonatiuh. It is not a deity of light or the day sky of the east, nor is it a god of life and the begin- ning of cosmic cycles as opposed to one of death and cyclic completion. Evidence for this is both linguistic and literary as well as visual. According to Miguel Covarrubias's recon- struction drawing of the badly damaged and faded face and hands at the center of the monument (Fig. 2), the deity represented there within the solar disk originally had yellow hair, a jewel-tipped nose plug, circular dangling earrings, large teeth in an open mouth, and a long protruding tongue, which takes the standard graphic form of the flint knife used by Aztec priests to remove the hearts of their sacri- ficial victims. The deity wore a red fillet decorated with two jade rings separated by an abstract jewelled ornament at its center. The facial painting was divided into two horizontal zones, the lower half of which was red, the upper half of which was a lighter red or pink.8 Two contiguous red bands, which may have read as either a single or double band, surrounded the outer edges of the eyes. The hands, which are still clearly clawed and which clutch human hearts, take the profile form of devouring monster heads. The absence of a body suggests that the god is viewed from above, his head upturned and hands upraised, thus hiding from view the body beneath them. In the Postclassic codices, the sun god Tonatiuh also wears circular dangling earrings, a jewel-tipped nose bar, and a blond wig; his fillet is decorated with jade rings (Fig. 3). In the literature of the period, moreover, Tonatiuh was associated with the eagle, a bird sometimes depicted in the codices in conjunction with Tonatiuh in the act of grasping human hearts with its claws. The god frequently appears - both in the form of a full-length figure and as a disembodied head - in company with the solar disk; occasionally his head, unlike that of any other deity, is set directly in the center of that disk. At times his eyes are framed on three sides by a single red band (Fig. 4). Tonatiuh never, however, appears with the monster- faced hands seen on the deity of the Aztec Calendar Stone, nor does he ever appear with a protruding tongue of any kind. His fillet is typically yellow rather than red and is typically decorated with at least three jade rings on each side and a central ornament that takes the form of the head of a bird. As a rule his eyes are not banded; when they are, a contiguous double band is never used. The god does appear frequently in the Aubin Tonalimatl' in his role of fourth of the thirteen Postclassic Mexican Lords of the Day, as a disembodied head set in the center of the solar disk and wearing not only a double (sometimes triple) eye-band, but a pink and red bi-zoned face painting as well (Fig. 5). Since the Aubin Tonalitmatl image was one of the major bases for Beyer's original identification of the Calendar Stone deity as Tonatiuh, however, it is in- structive that the identical markings appear in the same codex on the faces of the night sun gods Xochipilli and 7 For a complete discussion and defense of this position, see Klein. I presented a brief summary of the argument at the conference on "Death and the Afterlife in Pre-Columbian America" held by the Dumbarton Oaks Center for Pre-Columbian Studies on 27 October 1973, in a paper titled "Postclassic Mexican Death Imagery as a Sign of Cyclic Com- pletion," published in the proceedings, 1975. The central world direction differed from the other four world direc- tions in performing a transitional function. Since the Aztecs conceived of space, as well as time, in terms of recurring cycles, the end of one se- quence automatically predicted, and even inaugurated, the beginning of the next. The central world direction, therefore, although typically associated with the end of a sequence, could also signify the beginning of a new one. For this reason it was often referred to as the "up and down" direction, a term based on the belief that the center of the universe extended vertically from the bottom of the earth to the top of the sky, thereby permitting easy access from one region to the other. In its tem- poral affiliations, as a result, it occasionally appears to have been more closely associated with the actual beginning of a cosmic cycle than with an ending. Such occurrences are rare, however; in the vast majority of instances, the center is clearly associated with the end of a cycle and hence with darkness, earth, and death. So strong was this association that the central world direction often appears to have been conceptually fused with the south and in many instances simply to have been left out of a sequence in favor of it. 8 Covarrubias does not give his reasons for reconstructing the coloration of the Calendar Stone figure as he does, but his reconstruction is con- firmed by that of Robert F. Sieck who actually examined the pigments remaining on the stone (see Noriega, opp. 64). Beyer, 2o, reconstructs the deity's face as solid red, but admits to doing so "because Tonatiuh was painted this way in the codices of the central region" (author's translation).</page><page sequence="4">4 THE ART BULLETIN Piltzintecuhtli (Fig. 14).9 Both double eye-bands and a bi- colored face painting are in fact occasionally found elsewhere on both Xochipilli and Piltzintecuhtli, while, with the single exception of the Mixteca-Pueblan Codex Borgia, 55 (Fig. 4), where Tonatiuh's face is painted in two shades of red, the day sun god's face is elsewhere either solid red or solid yellow. In other words, only single eye-bands, not double eye-bands, or a bi-zoned face painting, are characteristic of Tonatiuh. Tonatiuh, moreover, never appears in the rare frontal, or en face, two-dimensional form adopted by the Calendar Stone deity. Even in the seemingly comparable Aubin Tonalimatl images the sun god is seen in profile view. Frontality, in fact, is always reserved in Postclassic two- dimensional imagery for those deities who are related to the female earth goddess Tlaltecuhtli who herself invariably appears two-dimensionally in en face form and who con- notes earth, darkness, agricultural fertility, death, and the world directions of west, south, and center (Fig. 6).10 Tlaltecuhtli is characterized visually by her dorsal "dis- played" posture in which both arms and legs are bent and outspread in the traditional pose assumed by native Mexican women during childbirth.11 Her head is typically upturned, as is better seen in a three-dimensional Aztec statue which represents her or her "sister" aspect Coatlicue (Fig. 7). Her monstrous face bears round, ringed, or banded eyes, an open mouth with sharp teeth, and a protruding tongue that often takes the form of a sacrificial flint knife. Her joints and extremities take the profile form of monstrous faces that frequently clutch human hearts. When she appears in two-dimensional form as Coatlicue, her frontal face, with its differentiated lower portion, its exposed teeth, its flint- knife tongue and its circular dangling earrings bears a striking resemblance to that of the deity of the Aztec Cal- endar Stone (Fig. 8). Since only deities who shared Tlaltecuhtli's connotations of earth, death, darkness, and cyclic completion could adopt her frontal form and unique insignia, and since this form and many of these insignia appear in the Calendar Stone deity, but never on Tonatiuh, there can be little doubt that the former refers, not to Tonatiuh, but to a solar deity of the earth, night, fertility, death, and the western, southern, and/or central world directions. This assumption is support- ed by the fact that throughout Postclassic Mexico, round, ringed, and banded eyes, long tongues, flint knives, and human hearts - all encountered on the Calendar Stone image - symbolize death.12 It is further supported by the fact that the Aztec land of the dead, Mictlkn, was originally located in the south or center of the world, at the navel of the female earth monster herself where it was associated in the calendar with the hour of midnight.13 Since the sun, like all celestial bodies, was believed to die and descend to the land of the dead each time it disappeared at the western horizon, it follows that a solar deity bearing the form and attributes of the female earth monster would represent the dead sun at night housed within her. We know, in fact, that the Aztecs believed that Tonatiuh, at the moment at which the sun disappears at the western horizon, was con- verted into another deity, a solar god of earth, death, and darkness, who passed through the underworld each night. This deity, who represented the dead sun at night in the body of the female earth monster, was variously known as Xochipilli, "Prince of Flowers," Piltzintecuhtli, "Lord of Princes," Yoaltonatiuh, "Night Sun," Tlalchitonatiuh or Ollintonatiuh, "Earth Sun," and Yohualtecuhtli, the "Lord of the Night." Xochipilli, the "Prince of Flowers," was a southern deity who was incorporated into the Aztec pantheon in the course of military conquest (Fig. 9). He was the patron of music, dance, songs, and games and was affiliated with sexual pleasure, lust, fertility, and the sun. In an Aztec hymn addressed to him, the god refers to himself as "I, the maize"; he is linked here, as elsewhere, with the maize god Cinteotl.14 Seler titles Xochipilli the "Lord of the South" and designates him as chief representative of that world direction.15 Together with the moon goddess Xochiquetzel he ruled the mythical land of Xochitlicacin, the "Land of Flowers," which was located in the south. Since the land of the dead and the hour of midnight were associated with the south as well as with the center of the world, it follows that Xochipilli was a god of earth, darkness, and death. In the Aztec hymn addressed to him, Xochipilli is indeed des- cribed as one who singsyoaltica, "in the night."16 In most literary accounts Xochipilli was the husband or lover of the moon and vegetation goddess Xochiquetzal, but he is replaced in this role by one Piltzintecuhtli in the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas and in an Aztec hymn addressed to Xochiquetzal.17 In the codices, as in the com- mentaries and legends, Xochipilli in turn occasionally sub- stitutes for Piltzintecuhtli and frequently appears with that god's insignia. According to the Histoire du Mechique, Pilt- zintecuhtli was Xochipilli's father.18 Xochipilli was intimately related to and even inter- changeable with Piltzintecuhtli because Piltzintecuhtli was also a solar deity. Piltzintecuhtli is often described as "the young sun god" and wears - like Xochipilli - a number of 9 Beyer, 15. 10 For a full defense of the thesis that frontality was reserved for deities associated with earth, death, darkness, and cyclic completion in two- dimensional Postclassic art, see my doctoral dissertation. 11 Seler, 1900-o01, 10o3 12 Thompson, 1960, 45, 173; E. Seler, "Explanation of the Wall Paint- ings of Mitla," in Central American Antiquities, Calendar Systems, and History, ed. C. P. Bowditch, Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin, xxvIII, 1904 323. The round, ringed, or banded eye was apparently roughly analogous to the closed eye, which also symbolized death. The closed eye is, however, relatively rare in Postclassic Mexican imagery and does not even appear on the major death deities Mictlantecuhtli and Micticacihuatl, whose eyes are round and/or ringed, but always open. For evidence that the ringed or banded eye in Postclassic Mexico was symbolically synony- mous with closed eyes in Postclassic Maya art, see Klein, 206-217. 13 Thompson, 1934, 222-25. Thompson argues here that the reported assignment of Mictlkn to the north at the time of the Conquest repre- sented either a very late development or a mistake on the part of the chroniclers themselves. 14 Sahagdin, III, 213- 15 Seler, I902-03, 139; see also Seler, I960-61, 11, 1097. 16 Sahagfin, mII, 213. 17 Seler, I960-6I, II, I035- 18 Ibid., Iv, 6o.

Although he appears as rattle- bearer of the east in Codices Borgia 5 I1, and Vaticanus B 2 1, and faces the flint-knife god Iztli in that section of the Codex F6jervary-Mayer world direction chart (page I) which corresponds to the east, Piltzintecuhtli is normally affiliated with the west. He appears in the F6jervary-Mayer world direction chart in his capacity as third of the nine Lords of the Night in which he was actually regent of the third Mexican day-sign Calli (House), which Seler describes as the "dark house of the earth, the west."19 Piltzintecuhtli was reported to have fathered the maize god Cinteotl in the mythical land of Tamoanchan which also was located in the west.20 According to an Aztec hymn addressed to the moon goddess Xochiquetzal, Piltzintecuhtli descended into the underworld in pursuit of her, his beloved; here he was believed to have intercourse with the moon.21 Since the moon was believed to be hostile to the day sun, or Tona- tiuh, Piltzintecuhtli can only have represented the sun at night.22 The Mayan counterpart of the third day-sign Calli (House) ruled by Piltzintecuhtli was in fact Akbal, "Night," which among the Maya was ruled by the Jaguar God who represented the sun at night. The Aztec hymn sung every eight years at the festival celebrating the completion of the Venus-solar cycle clearly identifies the young sun god with night: See if Piltzintecuhtli resteth in the house of darkness, the house of night. O Piltzintli, Piltzintli, with yellow feathers are thou pasted over. On the ball court thou placest thyself, in the house of the night.23 There can be little doubt, therefore, that Xochipilli- Piltzintecuhtli was a solar deity who specifically represented the dead sun at night at the navel of the female earth mon- ster. He is associated, accordingly, with the phenomenon of frontality in two-dimensional art, which signifies a relation to that goddess. Both Piltzintecuhtli and his Mayan counter- part, the Jaguar God, were associated with the number seven, and in Maya hieroglyphic writing the number seven was actually interchangeable with a conventionalized frontal face.24 The Jaguar God often appears two-dimen- sionally in frontal form. Xochipilli himself ruled the twen- tieth and final Mexican day-sign Xochitl (Flower) whose Mayan counterpart was the Ahau glyph which also took the form of a frontal face (Fig. I I). J. Eric S. Thompson identi- fies the latter as the face of the sun and concludes that it is "almost certainly" that of the young sun god.25 Moreover, since the Ahau glyph is always inverted when it appears in the Maya glyphs for east and sunrise, it would seem that its normal position refers to the sun in the underworld in the west, south, or center of the world. Its Mexican day-sign counterpart Xochitl always symbolized the south and, sig- nificantly, the hour of midnight as well. Xochipilli-Piltzintecuhtli appears twice, moreover, in Codices Vaticanus B 96, and Borgia 53, in the full-length frontal displayed form of the female earth monster so closely related to the night sun (Figs. 12, 13). Here the god assumes the disguise of a deer, an act that surely refers to the Mexi- can legend that Piltzintecuhtli turned into a deer on the day 7 Xochitl (7 Flower), the day of the annual festival held in honor of his beloved, the moon goddess Xochiquetzal. Maya myths frequently tell how the young sun god dons a deer disguise in order to woo the moon.26 Again, since only the night sun - never the day sun - was on intimate terms with the moon, these en face images of Xochipilli-Piltzinte- cuhtli in deer disguise can only refer to the sun at night. Xochipilli-Piltzintecuhtli, a god of the night sun in the underworld, therefore shares with the central deity of the Aztec Calendar Stone the ability to be represented in two dimensions in the frontal form characteristic of the female earth monster Tlaltecuhtli. He further shares with the Calendar Stone deity the bi-zoned face painting: in the Aubin Tonalamatl his face is painted in two shades of red, and elsewhere it is often painted red on the bottom and yellow on the top (Fig. 14). Xochipilli-Piltzintecuhtli appears, moreover, in Codex Borgia 14, 16, 28, and 57, as elsewhere, with double red bands surrounding the outer edges of his eyes (Fig. 9). The eye-bands reappear in Codex Borgia 39 on the disembodied face of an earth monster with upraised arms who has attributes of Xochipilli-Piltzintecuhtli (Fig. 15). Xochipilli often appears in the codices wearing a red rather than yellow fillet decorated with only one or two jade rings on each side. During the Aztec Xochilhuitl, or "Flower Feast," held in honor of Xochipilli, that god's impersonator carried an impaled human heart. These rather remarkable correspondences between the young sun god of night and the deity of the Aztec Calendar Stone certainly support the contention that the latter represents the night sun and further suggest that it may in fact repre- sent, at least in part, the god Xochipilli-Piltzintecuhtli himself. Human hearts, however, like long tongues and clawed hands and feet, were also characteristic of the Tzitzimime, the stellar souls of dead warriors who descended to the center of the earth at midnight during certain critical periods in the Aztec calendar. At the end of the fifth and final "sun," when the world was to be destroyed by earth- quakes on the day 4 Ollin at the end of a fifty-two-year cycle, the Tzitzimime were expected to descend; at this 19 Seler, 1901, 67. 20 Seler, I96-6I,11, , 035. 21 See J. Soustelle, La pensde cosmologique des anciens Mexicains, Paris, 1940, 40. 22 There are a number of myths that reveal that the sun in the day sky was hostile to the moon; according to one, the sun's first act was to de- fend his mother, the earth, by cutting off the head of his sister, the moon, and putting his remaining siblings, the stars, to flight. According to Caso, 1958, 13, the sun was believed to reenact this victory every morn- ing upon rising. In contrast, many Mexican and Maya legends make it clear that the dead sun in the underworld at night was in love with the moon, who is repeatedly identified as his wife or consort. See J. E.!S.

The commentator of Codex Telleriano-Remensis lists a certain "Yoalaotecotli" among the ranks of these stellar demons and Thompson equates him with the god Yohualtecuhtli, "Lord of the Night," whom Seler identifies as the night sun in the underworld.27 Sahagi6n reports that incense was not only offered four times a day to the day sun Tonatiuh, but five times each night as well to the sun god iovaltecutli, or "Lord of the Night.""28 Sahag6in further identifies as Yohualtecuhtli the star known to us as Castor, which formed part of a constellation called Mamalhuaztli, the "Fire Drill Sticks." Although Sahag'in reports that it was the sight of the Pleiades at the zenith of the midnight sky that signaled the beginning of another fifty-two-year cycle, he notes that Mamalhuaztli was close to the Pleiades.29 The two constellations were in fact closely associated with each other at the moment of the drilling of New Fire; so close, apparently, was this relationship that Alfonso Caso contends that it was the appearance of the star Yohualtecuhtli in the center of the midnight sky at the end of every fifty-two-year solar cycle that signaled a temporary reprieve from the cosmic cataclysm that the Aztecs be- lieved awaited them.30 A god known as Yohualtecuhtli who represented the sun at night and the Tzitzimime was therefore apparently associated with the end of the fifty-two-year cycle. Sahagu'n, moreover, further links Yohualtecuhtli directly to the date 4 Ollin. In the course of his discussion of the Aztecs' worship of the sun, Sahagu6n passes from a discussion of Tonatiuh to the night sun Yohualtecuhtli and reports that: "It was said:/'The Lord of the Night, he of the sharp nose, hath unfolded, and we know not how his office will end.'/And his feast day came upon the day of the day-count called naui ollin, every two hundred and three days."31 According to Beyer, the Ollin sign was itself a symbol of the constellation Mamalhuaztli, the "Fire Drill Sticks."32 In Codex Borbonicus I6, the date 4 Ollin is replaced by the "earth sun" deity Tlalchitonatiuh as co-patron of the sixteenth Aztec week. The dead sun at night at the center of the earth therefore shared his name and associations with the very stellar being who controlled the destiny of the Aztec nation.33 There are relatively few visual images of deities in Post- classic art that have been identified as Yohualtecuhtli, but it is significant that those that have been so identified share a number of features with the Aztec Calendar Stone deity. Seler identifies as "Yohualtecuhtli, the solar god of the underworld" a large full-length figure on page 40 of Codex Borgia whose body is frontal and displayed (Fig. I6).34 The god's profile head is upturned in the manner characteristic of the female earth monster and his eye is surrounded by a single red band on three sides. A giant sun disk forms the deity's torso; smaller sun disks, which take the form of an- thropomorphic profile monster heads, adorn his joints and extremities. A comparable deity on page 43 of the same codex boasts the snout of a crocodile and a protruding tongue (Fig. 17). On page 35 of Codex Borgia, two full- length figures, again wearing single red eye-bands and crocodile costumes, are specifically identified by Krickeberg as the dead sun who nightly passes through the under- world.35 The body of one is again frontal and displayed (Fig. I8). Seler understandably identifies the Borgia 35 figures with Cipactli, the earth crocodile of the east, but simul- taneously concludes that they, like the Borgia 43 figure, represent lunar deities.36 Since the moon was always affil- iated with the female earth monster and the west, south, or center of the world - never with Cipactli or the east - the appearance here of crocodilian features must refer, like the frontal displayed form and anthropomorphic joints, not to Cipactli, but to Tlaltecuhtli and her association with dark- ness, death, and the earth.37 Although Seler does not directly identify the Borgia 35 and 43 deities as Yohual- tecuhtli, he does conclude that Yohualtecuhtli may have represented the moon in the underworld as well as the night sun. Confirmation of the identification of the Aztec Calendar Stone deity as Yohualtecuhtli comes from the writings of Sahagiin. In speaking of the feast held on the day naui ollin, Sahaguin reports: "And there was the image of that one [the sun] at a pyramid temple called Quauxicalli. There was erected his image, his image was designed as if it had the mask of a man [but] with [the sun's] rays streaming from it. His sun ornament was round, circled with feathers; sur- rounded with red spoonbill [feathers].''38 27 Thompson, 1934, 228-29; Seler, 1963, 11, 28. 28 Sahaguin, Im, 202. 29 Ibid., 60. 30 Caso, 1958, 20. See also Krickeberg, 178-79. Caso, for reasons he does not cite, identifies the star Yohualtecuhtli with Aldebaran rather than Castor and states that it was observed in conjunction with either the Pleiades or Aries. E. Seler, in "The Venus Period in the Borgian Codex Group," in Central American Antiquities, Calendar Systems, and History, ed. C. P. Bowditch, Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin, xxviim, Washington, D.C., 1904, 356-57, also repudiates Sahagln's identification of Mamal- huaztli with Gemini and concludes that it may have been part of Aries. 31 Sahaguin, In, 202. This statement includes an error on Sahagin's part since, owing to the nature of the tonalpohualli, the day 4 Ollin could recur only once every 260 days. 32 Beyer, 34- 33 That a star in the center of the midnight sky should share the name and connotations of the dead sun simultaneously located at the center of the earth is understandable in view of the Postclassic belief that the underworld and its inhabitants nightly pass into, or are reflected in, the dark heavens. The stars were traditionally regarded as the "souls" of the dead in the underworld at the center of the earth and all nocturnal celestial bodies were affiliated with the earth, the underworld, and the western, southern, and central world directions. See Krickeberg, 130, and Klein, 33-34- 34 Seler, 1963, II, 42. 35 W. Krickeberg, "Das mittelamerikanische Ballspiel und Seine Rel- igiose Symbolik," Paideuma, III, 1948, 141, 164- ?36 Seler, 1963, II, 28. 37 Although Tlaltecuhtli was reportedly a toad, she was the female counterpart of the earth crocodile Cipactli and as such was closely rel- ated to and occasionally even confused with him. While the directional and temporal associations of the two were in direct opposition, both deities represented the earth. In two-dimensional Postclassic imagery, Tlaltecuhtli's frontal face often appears to be formed of two profile heads of Cipactli conjoined at the back or front. Tlaltecuhtli thus typically shares with Cipactli a missing lower jaw, sharp pointed teeth, a curled nose and curled eyebrow, and a flint knife projecting from the nose. 38 Sahagain, I1, 203-</page><page sequence="9">THE AZTEC CALENDAR STONE 9 :-.i-ai::_:::: :: -:-r:~~:~i:::: ~iiiiiii:_ii ~i_~:-:~ ~liiiiiii;:'::-L:- ::: ~k:--:e::::::: :_:::~ :.. ~:----~: i:i:~:-_::~,,:: _:::-:-: ::--:~~-::- -iiji~~::iii:_iii~iiiiijii:i~iiis:ii~~i Y~:" : : .-. ::~: ::-:-:i::-:i::~:i :i:::-:~::: .-- j:::::::i~ii_:~i:i?~i:i:--i.i~8i__?iii_- ;:::::::::':: :::i-:- : :::::: :::: --:-li:::-----:-_-:;iii:ii-~:-~::-:::i~l I~ :c-:~: ::: :i::: i~ii ~?~II :i: ~:a a:. ^d ~~~~ ~-~ ~er~ cl~~ ;~!I:I-~~ illlll : E:~IZi~zs . i :r:::: :I-:--:::::: TD i- xp ai-- ~~ L~H~ rr ~ ~-~ii i: -i-iiii~:9~i~9~?~;i~~ii li-~i i_: i~iii: -~:; ii~'i :::::-: :- s_: s r 1Bs~srs~P~s~iar~'~%s~i~ll~[LBr`~;lB~g~~ i~:_~;~~ --i~ _i :::~: -:* ~-111111~:-~:il!-11:-.II : i r 18 The Night Sun(?), detail of Codex Borgia, fol. 35 (from Seler, 1963, III, 35) ea -'~IMIYR\ I~~Z~ - iiiiiii~l~ 3 "4PL~ 5/ 20o The date "4 Ollin" with single round eye, drawing (from Beyer, fig. 69) 21 X6lotl, Huastec stone relief from Tepetzintla, Veracruz.

Although the Aztec Calendar Stone lacks the red spoonbill feathers men- tioned by Sahaguin, Sahag6in's illustration for obvious reasons has been frequently compared with that monument. Scholars have further assumed that Sahag6in was specifi- cally referring here to the day sun god Tonatiuh and have thus cited the accompanying illustration as proof that the Calendar Stone figure also represents that deity. Analysis of Sahagi6n's text reveals, however, that the passage referring to the frontal image of a solar deity immediately follows that discussing the Lord of the Night Yohualtecuhtli and his feast day naui ollin. The description of the solar image and the matching illustration therefore clearly refer to the sun in its nocturnal aspect. In a number of Postclassic images, moreover, the Ollin sign, often in the context of the date 4 Ollin, is depicted with a single round half-closed eye at its center (Fig. 20). According to Seler, this eye symbolized the Tzitzimime, the setting sun, and the night.39 The unique substitution in the Aztec Calendar Stone of a frontal face for the traditional eye within the Ollin symbol strongly suggests that the deity represented on the stone also represented the Tzitzimime, the setting sun, and the night. Throughout Mesoamerica the frontal face was and is conceptually equated with the eye; the Zinacantan Tzotzil word for "face" (sat), for example, is the same as that for "eyes," while the Zapotec lao, loo means "face," "eyes," and "frontside."40 39 Seler, I96o-6I, II, 723-24; Seler, I900-OI, Io8. 40 The Yucatec Maya word for "face" (ich) similarly means both "eye" and "front." Sahaguin's catalogue of his Aztec informants' descriptions of the parts of the human body includes the following: "Face; that is to say, eye..."

Furthermore, since Seler concludes that the round eye at the center of the Ollin symbol functioned as a sign for the Nahuatl word for "night," youalli, it is probable that the substituted frontal face on the Aztec Calendar Stone served a related para- linguistic function. If this is the case, then the word for "night" may well even have appeared in the deity's name. Two solar deities include the Nahuatl word for "night" in their names - one is Yoaltonatiuh, the "Night Sun"; the second is his close relative Yohualtecuhtli, the great "Lord of the Night." The appearance on the Calendar Stone of attributes of Tonatiuh combined with attributes of the female earth monster and the nocturnal sun gods Xochipilli and Piltzintecuhtli in a solar context commonly reserved for the symbol for "night" therefore leaves little doubt that the deity represented there was a solar god of the night. Yohualtecuhtli, however, represented not only the dead night sun in the underworld, but the "dead" planet Venus as well. Among the Mexicans, as among the Maya, the 584-day Venus cycle was divided into four phases, each of which corresponded to a specific world direction. The first phase was that of the Morning Star which appears at dawn in the east, the second was that of superior conjunction which was associated with the north, the third was that of the Evening Star which appears at dusk in the west, and the fourth was that of its disappearance in inferior conjunction in the south (or center) of the world. As was the case with all stars and planets, including the sun, Venus was believed to be "born" in the east as the Morning Star and, as the god X61otl, the Evening Star, to "die" upon its descent to and disappearance at the western horizon. Upon entering the body of the female earth monster Tlaltecuhtli, Venus, like the sun, assumed that goddess's associations and in- signia. Accordingly, the Evening Star of the west and the planet in inferior conjunction in the south or center of the world appear occasionally in Postclassic two-dimensional imagery in the frontal form of Tlaltecuhtli, with displayed limbs, upturned head, clawed hands and feet, round, ringed, or banded eyes, large teeth, and a protruding tongue (Fig. 21). Moreover, since the Venus cycle, like the solar cycles, began at dawn in the east and concluded at or around midnight in the south or center of the world, these en face images of the western and southern phases of the cycle must similarly refer to the conclusion of a cycle. The frontal so-called "Morning Star" reliefs seen on Mausoleum III at Chichen Itzi, which actually represent the Evening Star in inferior conjunction in the south or center of the world, are in fact accompanied by the date of the completion of a "Great Venus Cycle" consisting of 260 revolutions of that planet (Fig. 22).41 41 See Seler, I960-6i, I, 693-94, for an analysis of the Chich'n ItzA reliefs. For a defense of the thesis that these reliefs, like all enface Post- classic two-dimensional images of Venus, refer to the planet in inferior conjunction in the south or center of the world at the end of a Venus cycle, see Klein, 89-91.</page><page sequence="11">THE AZTEC CALENDAR STONE II The Great Venus Cycle, however, simultaneously ended on the same day as a cycle of eight fifty-two-year solar "centuries." The 584-day Venus cycle also terminated on the same day as a 365-day solar cycle every eight years and further coincided with the completion of every other fifty- two-year cycle; in other words, the rituals carried out at the end of every other fifty-two-year cycle marked not only the completion of the major Aztec solar cycle but the comple- tion of a Io4-year Venus cycle as well. At this time, as at any time in which the sun and Venus simultaneously com- pleted a cycle, the two celestial bodies were believed to engage in mortal nocturnal combat and ultimately to fuse in the dark bowels of the female earth monster. The hymn sung during the Aztec Atamalqualiztli festival held at the conclusion of the eight-year Venus-solar cycle tells of such a nocturnal contest between the young sun god of night, Piltzintecuhtli, and X6lotl, the god of the planet Venus as the Evening Star. This hymn opens, significantly, with an address to "the lord of the night."42 One of the Maya names for Venus was ah piz a'kab, "Lord of the Night." In pursuing his own interpretation of the Aztec Calendar Stone as a device for astronomical calculations, Jose Aviles- Solares proposes that the date 4 Ollin, when it is pierced by an arrow-like device such as penetrates it on the Cal- endar Stone, refers to the conclusion of the eight-year Venus, solar cycle.43 Seler demonstrates that the Ollin sign was associated with the fifth and final period (as opposed to phase) of the planet Venus as well as with the fifth and final sun; in Codex Borgia 25, as Seler points out, it appears in this context as a symbol of the central world direction.44 As the seventeenth of the twenty Aztec day-signs, moreover, Ollin was ruled by X6lotl, the Evening Star, who was actually associated in the Postclassic mind with the dead sun as it sank beneath the western horizon. The commen- tator of Codex Vaticanus B states that the date 4 Ollin was merely another name for X6lotl and the commentator of Codex Vaticanus A designates the day 4 Ollin as the day of the disappearance into the Red Sea of Quetzalc6atl, a historical personage later associated with Venus who was believed to have died and to have been later reborn in the eastern sky as the Morning Star.45 In Codices Borgia and Vaticanus B, the date 4 Ollin co-ruled the sixteenth week of the calendar with X6lotl. Both the end of the fifty-two-year solar cycle and the critical date 4 Ollin were therefore associated with the planet Venus in its final phase as the Evening Star in inferior conjunction in the south or center of the world. It would seem likely that the Aztecs, who envisioned a cataclysmic destruction of the universe at the end of a fifty-two-year solar cycle, expected that destruction to occur at the simultaneous completion of a Venus cycle as well. A number of related Postclassic images confirm the possibility that the frontal face at the center of the Aztec Calendar Stone refers to the god Yohualtecuhtli at the end of a Venus as well as a solar cycle. In the center of page 28 of Codex Borgia, the rain god T1iloc appears in the guise of Xochipilli-Piltzintecuhtli, the night sun, as representative of the fifth and last of the Venus-solar periods (Fig. 23). He wears the red and yellow zoned face painting and the double red eye-bands characteristic of that god and similar to the insignia of the Calendar Stone deity. According to Seler, Tl1loc as Xochipilli here represents the center of the world and the fusion of Venus with the sun.46 The Maya equiva- lent of Xochipilli's calendrical name I Xochitl (I Flower) was I Ahau, or hun ahpu, the name of the Maya god of the dead planet Venus in the underworld. All of the Codex Borgia figures with frontal displayed bodies and red eye- bands are, moreover, located within that section of the codex that deals with the travels of Venus through the underworld. This includes the large figure on page 40 of that manuscript which Seler specifically identifies as Yohual- tecuhtli (Fig. 16). This figure actually wears the conch- shell earrings of the Venus god Quetzalc6atl and the paper leg bows frequently worn by the Evening Star deity X6lotl. In Codex Borbonicus 16, X6lotl appears opposite the earth sun deity Tlalchitonatiuh, as co-patron of the sixteenth week of the Aztec calendar, with double-banded eyes, a flint-knife tongue, and clawed hands and feet. The deity depicted at the center of the Aztec Calendar Stone can, therefore, no longer be identified as the sun god Tonatiuh who represented the day sky and the east. Neither the literary nor the graphic evidence supports this view. Even Durain's report that the human sacrifice performed in honor of the sun on the day 4 Ollin was theoretically carried out at midday when the sun was at the center of the day sky, rather than at midnight, does not negate the thesis.47 Since both the zenith and the nadir were regarded as part of the unifying central world direction, the two were often concep- tually synonymous and, at times, even interchangeable.48 In the version of the destruction of the second cosmogonic 42 Sahaguin, 1II, 212-13. Seler, I960-6I 11, 10, I59, translates this as "he, the Lord of Midnight" (English translation mine). The passage equates this night lord with the word xochitl ("Flower") in two instances, thus providing further evidence that the god Xochipilli (Flower Prince), ruler of the day-sign Xochitl (Flower), was at least an aspect or element of the deity known as the Lord of the Night: The flower of my heart lieth burst open, the lord of the night. She hath come, she hath come, our mother, the goddess Tlazolteotl. Cinteotl is born at Tamoanchan, the flowery place, on the day Ce xochitl. 43 Aviles-Solares, 36-37; 41-49. 44 Seler, I963, I, 264. Seler also proposes here that the date 4 Ollin in Codex Borgia 28 represents the date of the disappearance of Venus as Morning Star into superior conjunction in the north. His arguments rest, however, on the faulty assumption that the Dresden Codex Venus tables begin with heliacal rising on the day 13 Kan, rather than on the day I Ahau, and on an erroneous assignment of the Acatl years to the north rather than to the east. The five Venus periods were five consecutive Venus cycles of 594 days each which equalled exactly eight solar years. When the five Venus periods had recurred thirteen times, the final day coincided with both the end of the tonalpohualli and the fifty-two year cycle. This could happen only once every I04 solar years. 45 See Caso, 1967, 197, for a list of the various associations of the date 4 Ollin mentioned in the codices and chronicles. 46 Seler, 1963, I, 265- 47 D. Durin, The Aztecs: The History of the Indies of New Spain, trans. D. Heyden and F. Horcasitas, Norman, 1964, 122. 48 This probably explains why Seler, 1963,1, I66, associates Xochipilli, the "Lord of the South," with high noon, and may account, at least in part, for the apparent confusion at the time of the Conquest of north and south in regard to the location of the land of the dead (see note 13).</page><page sequence="12">12 THE ART BULLETIN sun, 4-Ocelotl, "4 Tiger," presented in the Anales de Cuauhtitlan, the moment of death and darkness is actually reported to have occurred at noon rather than at midnight: Then it happened that the sky was crushed, the sun did not follow its course. When the sun arrived at midday, immediately it was night and when it became dark, tigers ate the people ... 49 Clearly, the spatial contiguity of zenith and nadir implied a temporal contiguity between noon and midnight as well. We know, in fact, that all beings temporarily located at the center of the sky were believed capable of descending directly to earth and to the crossroads at its center; among these were the stellar Tzitzimime alluded to on the Aztec Calendar Stone. That the same belief applied to the hour of noon and the sky by day is attested to by a contemporary Aztec story recorded by Madsen that tells of a man who hitched a ride with the sun at dawn; at noon the sun said to the man, "Here is where I leave you," and the man fell down into his own home below.50 The Aztec Calendar Stone image must therefore be re- garded as a representation of the darkened sun and planet Venus at the center of the earth at the moment of cyclic destruction and completion in which they fused to create the hybrid deity Yohualtecuhtli, the great Aztec "Lord of the Night." Since Yohualtecuhtli was a god of the earth, dark- ness, death, and the south and center of the world, his appearance here in a context of the end of the world at the center of the earth in the middle of the night is far more logical than would be that of Tonatiuh. More under- standable, too, are the appearance of traits of the female earth monster and the rare utilization of the frontal form that always indicates cyclic completion in Postclassic Mexico. Recognition of the Aztec Calendar Stone deity as Yohualtecuhtli thus avoids the logical and cosmological discrepancies involved in its identification as Tonatiuh reveals a new level of beauty and profundity in the famous carving.
