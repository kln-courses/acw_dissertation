<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EPISTEMIC STATUS OF ANALOGICAL LANGUAGE In the light of the demands made on language by analytic philos- ophers, many theologians and philosophers of religion have de- fended the use of analogical language to talk about God because the only alternative has seemed to them to be either the use of anthro- pomorphisms or holy silence - neither of which is particularly inviting. Mascall states the dilemma explicitly by saying, "Without analogy of attribution, it hardly seems possible to avoid agnosti- cism."1 I believe that the use of analogy does not really offer an escape from the attacks on religious language made by analytic philosophers. I wish to argue that any meaningful use of analogical language to talk about x, presupposes that something literal about x is already known. Such a claim has been made before. W. V. O. Quine, for example, says, "... analogy in the primary sense, as we might call it, relates things that are already known apart from the analogy."2 William T. Blackstone also says, ". . . if one is to know analogically something of God (or any other object) then one must know some- thing of God (or any other object) literally."3 But what has not been made clear is exactly why such literal knowledge is required and how analogical uses of language depend upon prior literal knowledge. The problem is essentially one of determining which analogical uses of language might be appropriate or "fitting" to use to talk about x. Ian T. Ramsey, for example, employs heavily qualified, non-literal phrases to talk about God, e.g. First Cause, Infinitely Wise, Infinitely Good, and Eternal Purpose.4 The question which arises is "Why did Ramsey choose the models 'Wise', 'Good5, and 1 E.

Ramsey admits that "any word may be a 'model'",5 but when the use of the word 'evil' is discussed, Ramsey says that 'evil' is generally used in relation to 'devil' not 'God.' It is part of the "logic" (?) of the word 'devil' to use qualified forms of 'evil' to talk about the devil, Ramsey says; but evidently such is not part of the "logic" (?) of the word 'God.' I suggest that what Ramsey means when he suggests that it would be violating the "logic" of the word 'God' to attempt to explicate it by using qualified forms of 'evil' really has nothing to do with logical difficulties at all. There is undoubtedly an oddness involved in talking about God as infinitely evil; one immediately wants to say, "That's not appropriate," or "That's not fitting," but this oddness has nothing to do with any logical difficulties. The problem is simply one of determining what one is willing to allow as an appropriate or fitting analogy. Hume was making this point, I think, in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion when he has Philo suggest several different analogies to the one used by Cleanthes' argument from design. Hume has Philo return time and time again to the questioning of the fittingness of the particular analogies used by Cleanthes. And finally, in Part VI, when Philo suggests that the world is more like an animal than it is like a ship or a house or any other product of man's intelligence and workmanship, Cleanthes himself begins to point out the dissimil- itudes involved in the animal analogy, for example, no sense organs. Cleanthes by attacking Philo's animal analogy really is under- mining all use of analogy including his own since the crucial issue becomes how does one explain and defend the fittingness of any analogy. This question of what I shall call the fittingness of the linguistic usage is an important one ; it is this notion which necessitates prior literal knowledge to any meaningful use of analogical language. Let us examine for a moment the well-known analogy of proper pro- portionality : God is to man as a shepherd is to his sheep. Notice the large amount of totally extraneous material which is completely irrelevant to the intended use of the analogy. Such material is not only irrelevant but can be misleading, and if a person is to under- stand what is intended to be conveyed by the use of the analogy, he 5 Ibid., p. 91.</page><page sequence="3">THE EPISTEMIG STATUS OF ANALOGICAL LANGUAGE 213 must sift through this extraneous material and eliminate it. Imagine a person's complete helplessness in trying to understand the analogy if he has no prior knowledge about its meaning. What does it mean to say, "God is to man as a shepherd is to his sheep"? Does this mean that God leads man into the hillsides to graze as the shepherd leads the sheep? No? Well, does it mean that God will one day shear man of his wool as the shepherd does the sheep? But man has no wool, and when a sheep can no longer produce wool he is led to the slaughter. Does it follow then that God is leading man to slaugther because man is incapable of producing wool? Most religious people would say that such meanings are not "fitting". What a religious person would probably mean by the statement, "God is to man as a shepherd is to his sheep", would be something like the following: God loves man; he is concerned with man's welfare, and God pro- tects man from dangers. He is man's leader, and man should obey him and follow him as the sheep do the shepherd. This is the fitting interpretation, but a person could never know this simply by a consideration of the statement. "God is to man as a shepherd is to his sheep." Woodbridge O. Johnson makes this point using what is, perhaps, an even better example. To speak metaphorically is to speak of one thing as though it were another because of an observed similarity between them. At the points of similarity metaphor is a true character- izer; at all other points it is irrelevant and hence falsifying. Take the case of the mother who, watching her small son eat breakfast, calls him a pig. The metaphor "pig" is an accurate characterizer at specifiable points; for both animals eat greedily, sloppily, and noisily. But it is irrelevant and falsi- fying at other points; namely, possession of four legs, a curly tail, and potential bacon.6 Johnson suggests exactly what I have been maintaining. He speaks of "an observed [emphasis mine] similarity" between the two things which are compared. This observed similarity is the literal knowledge which I have said is presupposed by the use of non-literal language. In regards to the example used, a person must know prior to the use of the metaphor that the child at the table was similar to 6 Woodbridge O.Johnson, "Anthropomorphism: Outmoded or Inevitable" in Analogy and the Problem of God' s Personality (Parkville, Missouri: Park College Press, 1955), p. 15.</page><page sequence="4">214 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION a pig because of his eating habits, and only when such prior knowl- edge is present is the metaphor meaningful. When one says "a is to b as c is to d" he does not intend that a is to b as c is to d in every respect. If a were related to b in any and all of the ways in which c and d were related, then there would be no need for the use of an analogy because the relations between a and b and c and d would be identical. There will then be dissimilitudes between the two pairs of terms in any analogy of proper proportion- ality. Also, some similarities will always exist between the relations which hold between any two pairs of terms. The relations which hold between a and b (in "a is to b") will always be similar in some ways and dissimilar in others to the relations which hold between c and d (in "c is to d"). What is really needed are some bases, some rules, some guidelines for deciding which of the multifarious ways of interpreting an analo- gy is the proper one. But these bases, rules, or guidelines never are included in the analogy itself. Jerry Fodor and Jerrold Katz, when considering the problem of explicating the notion rule of language^ consider several different analogies offered by ordinary language analysts, e.g. a recipe, a rule of grammar, a rule of game, or a dance instruction.7 In no case, however, is there any "... basis for deci- ding which of these analogies is most profitably used to interpret the notion rule of language ,"8 The reason for this is simply because we must already know what a rule of language is before being able to meaningfully use any analogy to interpret this notion. Fodor and Katz summarize the matter thus; "... no analogy can explicate itself. In particular, even an illuminating analogy cannot itself say why it is illuminating."9 No analogy wears its illumination on its sleeve. If an analogy is to be illuminating to a person, if an analogy is to be fitting, if one is to sift through the extraneous, irrelevant information, and if the analogy itself does help in these regards, then some prior knowledge is necessary. Thomas McPherson's discussion of what I have called the fitting- ness of an analogy illustrates well, I think, how some writers have failed to grasp the real epistemic significance of the literal knowledge 7 Jerry A. Fodor and Jerrold J. Katz, The Structure of Language (Englewood Cliffs : Pren- tice-Hall, Inc., 1964), p. 13. 8 Ibid. 9 Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">THE EPISTEMIG STATUS OF ANALOGICAL LANGUAGE 215 presupposed by any meaningful use of analogical language. In "Assertion and Analogy"10 McPherson points out that even though the religious person usually wants to say of his analogies that they are true or false, really we do not properly talk that way of analo- gies; we should say rather that they are "good" or "bad" (fitting or non-fitting). "'Good' analogies," says McPherson, are those that make their point simply and clearly; and they are those that are fruitful - those that suggest naturally the possibility of development in more than one direction . . ,"n This passage camouflages some important points. How do we know what point it is which an anal- ogy is supposed to make? And if we do not know this, how can we ever tell whether the correct point is being made "simply and clear- ly." Whatever our source of the answers to these questions, it will come from outside the analogy and will have to be defended. And ought "good" analogies be regarded as good for suggesting possibili- ties of development in more than one direction? We have already seen the difficulty caused by doing this with the shepherd analogy and pig metaphor. McPherson is intent upon distinguishing between talking about the truth of an analogy which he takes to be inappropriate and the meaningfulness of an analogy. He says, It seems hardly relevant to ask: Is it true that God's rela- tion to us is that of the father in the parable of the Prodigal Son to (chiefly) his younger son? It seems even less relevant to ask: Is God really a shepherd? The point is that analogies are often tendered in explanation of things that cannot be expressed in any but analogical, metaphorical, indirect, ways. We are not reduced to analogy when we want to say that a film has gone on too long, but we are when we want to talk about God. There is often no alternative statement - no simple, non-analogical, literal, statement - that will do the job we want done. If there were such a simple, non-analogical, literal, statement available we should not have been reduced in the first place to using analogies and metaphors in order to say what we want to say.12 10 Thomas McPherson, "Assertion and Analogy," Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol. 60, 1959-60. 11 Ibid., pp. 162-163. 12 Ibid., p. 163.</page><page sequence="6">2 1 6 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION Certainly McPherson is correct in not wanting to regard analogies themselves as true or false, but if the analysis offered here is correct some truth claims must be established before any meaningful use of an analogy can be offered. It may be irrelevant to ask whether it is true that God really is a shepherd, but it will always be relevant to ask whether it is true that God bears such and such a relation to man as is borne to sheep by shepherds. McPherson claims in the passage cited above that "The point is that analogies are often tendered in explanation of things that cannot be expressed in any but analogical, metaphorical, indirect, ways," but this claim ignores the epistemic role played by the literal knowledge presupposed by analogical uses of language. If McPher- son's claim is true, how could one ever determine which analogy was fitting for expressing whatever it is which is to be expressed and how could one ever claim that one use of an analogy was better than another? McPherson comes close to recognizing the difficulty involved here when he says, "If we are to be able to say that state- ments are analogical, metaphorical, or parabolic, some at least of their terms must in the literal sense be understood by us."13 And he also admits that we can only recognize "that a statement about A is a metaphorical or analogical statement if we are able to look at it alongside other statements about A that are not metaphorical or analogical statements."14 Both of these passages concentrate on the problem of our recognizing and identifying analogies as analogies, and though I agree with McPherson on this point, by making the point this way, the fact is obscured that the problem is really an epistemic one. The real problem is not being able to identify an analogy as such but of being able to understand an analogy; what is at stake is the meaningfulness of analogies. And we are right back in the lap of the analytic philosopher again since meaningfulness itself must be explicated either by use of some form of the analytic philosopher's criterion of significance or in some other way. In either case, the use of analogy has only brought us full circle, and we are still confronted with the problem of defending the meaningfulness of religious claims. McPherson does try to get at this question of the justification of the use of analogical language with the notion of anchoring. Analytic 13 Ibid., p. 164. 14 Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">THE EPISTEMIG STATUS OF ANALOGICAL LANGUAGE 2 1 7 philosophers he claims have failed to distinguish between meaning and anchoring. McPherson says, "To give the anchor of 'God is our Father' is to state the reasons that make us want to assert it. Or, if you like, to say how it is anchored is to answer the question : What makes you say that?" This seems to be the kind of pre-analogical basis for which I have been asking, but anchoring proves to be a psychological process rather than an epistemological one. Recovery from a serious illness may serve as an anchor for "God is our Father",15 suggests McPherson, even though he admits that "there is no logical step from CI completely recovered from my serious illness last year' to 'God is our Father'".16 Such considera- tions constitute evidence (!) according to McPherson which "is relevant as tending to confirm or disconfirm semiotic religious asser- tions . . ."17 Certainly such considerations do not constitute evidence for asserting the analogy but only a. psychological reason for a particular person's asserting it. The notion of anchoring gets us no closer to the prior knowledge presupposed by analogical language. John Wisdom, in his contribution to the well-known symposium "Other Minds",18 rejects the use of analogy for knowing the mental states of other people, and his reason for doing so is a sound one. Some philosophers have argued that knowing "the state of the soul" of another person from observing his behavior is analogous to know- ing about the inhabitant of a house we never enter by observing the house from the outside, but Wisdom disagrees. He says, In the first place, when one argues from the lights behind the blinds and the clatter of the cups that the people opposite are having tea, this is based not merely on having noticed in one's own house a connexion between these things, but also upon having observed this connexion in the houses of others which one has entered. Without this support the argument would be much feebler, and much feebler still had one never stepped outside one's own front door. And now the whole falsity of this comparison begins to dawn on us. For it's not merely that a condition fulfilled in the case of inference 15 Ibid., p. 169. 16 Ibid., p. 170. 17 Ibid. Semiotic religious assertions are metaphors, or analogies, or as if statements. 18 John Wisdom, "Other Minds," Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplement, Vol. 20, 1964.</page><page sequence="8">2 1 8 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION from the outward state of a house or a motor car or a watch to its inward state is not fulfilled in the case of inference from a man's outward state to his inward state, it is that we do not know what it would be like for this condition to be fulfilled...19 In other words, we have no notion of what the experience of the inward states of other people would be like, and the analogy itself is of no help whatsoever. It would seem to follow a fortiori that the same would be true of attempts to employ analogical language to talk about God. If it is admitted that there are not observed similarities between God and other terms which would serve as bases for analo- gies, then could one ever know what it would be like to try to justify such connections "had one never stepped outside one's own front door?" The analytic philosopher's criterion of significance raises its ugly head again. Such considerations lead J. L. Austin to conclude, "... we don't . . . claim to know by analogy, but only to argue by analogy."20 This distinction is a crucial one. Surely, if we asked a person, "How do you know that there's a tea-party going on inside the house?21 and he answered "By analogy," we would consider the reply a strange one. Likewise, if we ask a person, "How do you know that God is loving and cares for man?" we do not expect "By analogy" for an answer; nor would we be likely to accept it. The notion of knowing (or coming to know) involves the processes of justification, offering evidence and the like, and the evidence which is required for knowing X must be present before any meaningful analogy between X and Y can be understood since the analogy must relate similarities between X and Y. If the similarities are not already known, then no fitting analogy can be understood, and if the similarities are known before the analogy is understood, then one does not come to know by analogy. One can argue from analogy when similarities between X and Y are already known to exist, but the source of the knowledge of the "known similarities" must be defended. And it is exactly this point at which the analytic philosophers are trying to get with their attack on religious language. Knowledge of similarities between God and 19 Ibid., pp. 124-125. 20 J. L. Austin, "Other Minds," Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplement, Vol. 20, 1946, p. 148. 21 The tea-party example is used by Wisdom, Austin, and Ayer.</page><page sequence="9">THE EPISTEMIG STATUS OF ANALOGICAL LANGUAGE 2 1 9 whatever he is compared to by the use of an analogy precedes the use of the analogy. These knowledge claims must be defended, and the analogy itself cannot be used. The use of analogy in science illustrates well the non-epistemic role which analogical language plays. Scientists have long used analogies to "relate the unfamiliar to the familiar" or to "explain the new and strange in terms of the old and familiar." But the resem- blances between the unfamiliar and the familiar must be known to the scientist before constructing the analogy; he does not claim to know the unfamiliar by analogy. The use of analogy also definitely plays a heuristic role in science. Analogies can suggest to a scientist a certain hypothesis for explaining hitherto unexplained phenomena. For example, Fourier's knowledge about the flow of liquids sug- gested to him similar hypotheses for explaining the conduction of heat, and perhaps his knowledge of liquids even suggested the specific experiments to be conducted to verify his hypotheses. In any case, however, the use of analogy here carries a heuristic value - not an epistemic one. Fourier did not claim to know the laws of the conduction of heat by analogy even though the use of analogy did suggest to him the hypotheses to form and the experiments to make. But a lucky hunch, a dream, or many other things might have spurred Fourier on ; the value of analogies in science seems to be more psychological than epistemological. All of this leaves theologians who defend the use of analogical language to talk about God still in the position of having to defend their knowledge claims. The fittingness of any analogy cannot be determined except by relying upon prior knowledge claims, which must be known to be true, and whatever the method of verification one uses to determine the truth of these claims, one must be willing to defend this method against the demands of analytic philosophy. The meaningfulness of any analogy then is derivative ; prior knowledge claims must first be known to be true, and before that, meaningful. Any meaningful use of analogy, then - the use of any fitting analogy - presupposes the meaningfulness and the actual determination of the truth of prior knowledge claims. Analogical uses of language are epistemically sterile, and the analogical horn of MascalPs dilemna proves to be as unpleasant as the other. James F.
