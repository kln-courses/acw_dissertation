<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORDSWORTH, BOCCACCIO, AND THE PAGAN GODS OF ANTIQUITY By ALAN G. HILL 'The world is too much with us' is perhaps the most arresting of Wordsworth's sonnets, but also one that is particularly open to misunderstanding. It does not seem to belong very obviously with other poems composed around the same time. How are we to interpret the climactic outburst of the poet which breaks obliquely across his measured indictment of 'getting and spending' and the imaginative sterility and alienation that result from it? Great God! I'd rather be A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.1 Wordsworth is saying, presumably, that superstition is preferable to worldliness or apathy if it preserves the life of the imagination and our sense of nature as a living presence with purposes akin to our own. The poet is not commending paganism at the expense of Christianity, but contrasting its 'poetry' with the deadly materialism of modern living which is out of tune with nature's 'powers' and nullifies our own. We can accept paganism as 'outworn', while admitting that it can still be a source of imaginative energy and power-as Hazlitt found it: ... as we shape towers, and men, and armed steeds, out of the broken clouds that glitter in the distant horizon, so, throned, above the ruins of the ancient world, Jupiter still nods sublime on the top of blue Olympus ... the sea gods ride upon the sounding waves, the long procession of heroes and demi-gods passes in endless review before us, and still we . . . 'have sight of Proteus coming from the sea, I And hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn'.2 But there is nothing in the first eight lines of the sonnet to prepare the reader for the startling paradox with which it closes. The irruption of deities from the Ancient World into what is apparently a contem- porary English landscape is disconcerting, even surreal; and though I Poetical Works of William Wordsworth, ed.

In fact, there is nothing quite like it in his poetry up to 1803, the most likely date of the sonnet. Hitherto, he had banished the pagan gods entirely from his poetic universe. Poetry that aspired to the 'Truth that cherishes our daily life' no longer had any place for such polite fictions which, as Locke had remarked long before, were 'more like the inventions of wit and adornments of poetry, than the serious persuasions of the wise and sober'.4 Could the classical gods ever again be anything more than personifications or figures of speech? The day seemed long gone by when they might be thought to embody in allegorical form the spiritual energies or 'powers' underlying the appearances of nature, which Wordsworth aspired to celebrate as 'an inmate of this active universe' and 'even as an agent of the one great Mind'.5 The Virgilian animism he clung to as a child, which survived into the poetry of 'Nutting' and the earliest versions of The Prelude,6 was, for him, a better guide to the living processes of nature than the old anthropo- morphic cults. The English Bible spoke of analogous 'powers' having control or influence in creation,7 and Shakespeare in The Tempest attributed to them the retribution that fell on Alonzo and his companions for their treachery to Prospero: for which foul deed The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have Incens'd the seas and shores, yea all the creatures, Against your peace.8 A universe of active 'powers', pagan or Christian, was not incom- patible with the forces of Newtonian physics, and even with Godwin's law of Necessity, and could thus be accepted as a poetic embodiment of both ancient and modern experience. It was for the poet to convey his own emotional responses to nature, not a body of doctrines. Wordsworth may have had this in mind in his letter of c. 1804 about education in which he recommended, along with the study of fairy 3 See Paradise Lost, iii. 604; Colin Clout's come home again, 1. 245.

It was the same 'active Principle' which subsists In all things, in all natures; in the stars Of azure heaven, the unenduring clouds, In flower and tree, in every pebbly stone That paves the brooks, the stationary rocks, The moving waters, and the invisible air.

These lines from the climax of The Excursion (1814),11 composed in 1798, echo Tintern Abbey and the anima mundi of Aeneid VI, circling back towards the Virgilian influences from which Wordsworth set out, and forward to the 'Powers' that continue to haunt his later poetry, for example in the second sonnet of the Ecclesiastical Sketches, and in 'At Sea off the Isle of Man', from the Itinerary Poems of 1833.12 As late as the Preface of 1815 he was arguing that 'the anthropomorphitism of the Pagan religion' subjected the minds of the poets of the Ancient World too much to 'the bondage of definite form'.13 In spite of these reservations, however, the pagan gods stage something of a come-back in his poetry from 1803 onwards, as we 9 The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth: The Middle Years, Part I, ed.

There is, for example, the moving evocation of classical pastoral in The Prelude Book VIII, written in the knowledge that Coleridge was actually enjoying the Italian landscapes which Wordsworth could conjure up only in imagination: Smooth life had herdsman, and his snow-white herd To triumphs and to sacrificial rites Devoted, on the inviolable stream Of rich Clitumnus; and the goat-herd lived As calmly, underneath the pleasant brows Of cool Lucretilis, where the pipe was heard Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks With tutelary music, from all harm The fold protecting. 14 'Great Pan himself' also appears at the climax of the sonnet 'Composed by the Side of Grasmere Lake' (1807)15 as an image of the tranquillity of nature spread out under the vault of heaven beneath the planetary powers of Jove, Venus, and Mars. Pan, or 'the universal frame of things', was 'a noble fable', according to Bacon, who assigned the deepest significance to classical myth, 'and big almost to bursting with the secrets and mysteries of Nature'.16 Wordsworth would also recall Milton's description of the early creation: Universal Pan, Knit with the Graces, and the Hours in dance, Led on th' eternal Spring.17 But pagan mythology returns to Wordsworth's poetry with the most sustained splendour in the evocation of the ancient religions in Book IV of The Excursion, which is part of the Wanderer's message of hope to the Solitary as he emerges from the wilderness of Enlightenment scepticism and from his disappointment at the failure of the French Revolution. The passage was deeply engaging to all the poet's early admirers, who credited him with the restoration of their spiritual and imaginative well-being, and it will be examined in more detail below. Thereafter, as if with renewed confidence in the appropriateness of myth, Wordsworth occasionally returned to the pagan gods: in the 'Ode, 1814', for example, the ode 'On the Power of Sound', and in a late poem, 'Love Lies Bleeding', which, with its companion-piece, 14 Prel.

Towards the end of his life, in a Fenwick Note (1842) attached somewhat arbitrarily to the little-known 'Ode to Lycoris' (1817), one of the least interesting of his mythological poems, Wordsworth belatedly went some way towards providing an explanation. It constitutes his sole pronouncement on classical mythology. Recalling his love of the Greek and Roman poets in childhood ('Classical literature affected me by its own beauty'), and the prestige of classical culture at the Renaissance, he recognizes the objections of modern readers 'who think mythology and classical allusion too far-fetched and therefore more or less unnatural and affected'; but while voicing his own reservations on the subject, he finally comes down on the side of allowing it a place in modern poetry: No doubt the hackneyed and lifeless use into which mythology fell towards the close of the seventeenth century, and which continued through the eighteenth, disgusted the general reader with all allusion to it in modern verse; and though, in deference to this disgust, and also in a measure participating in it, I abstained in my earlier writings from all introduction of pagan fable-surely, even in its humble form, it may ally itself with real sentiment.. .19 What had convinced him that, while pagan divinities in modern poetry often amounted to little more than poetic devices or grotesque fancies that had lost all reality and naturalness, they were not necessarily so, and could still on occasion embody permanent truth and feeling? What had prompted him to think again about the living power of myth? The revival of poetic interest in the pagan gods of antiquity is usually traced back to Schiller's 'Die G6tter Griechenlands', pub- lished in Wieland's Teutscher Merkur in 1788. As has often been pointed out, the poem marked a turning-point in European feeling about the pagan religions.20 The ancient Greek gods, according to Schiller, represent an ideal of harmonious beauty and power which has vanished from the world, to be replaced by an outlook on life in which sense and spirit are at odds with each other, so that disenchant- ment and alienation set in. But there is no evidence that Wordsworth was at any time influenced by this poem, or even knew it. Coleridge, on the other hand, may have read it, and it possibly coloured his lines 18 PW iii. 143; ii. 323, 167. 19 Ibid. iv. 423. 20 See J. G.

The lines won the praise of Sir Walter Scott22 for 'the feelings so exquisitely expressed by a modern poet': The intelligible forms of ancient poets, The fair humanities of old religion, The Power, the Beauty, and the Majesty, That had their haunts in dale, or piny mountain, Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring, Or chasms and wat'ry depths; all these have vanished. They live no longer in the faith of reason! But still the heart doth need a language, still Doth the old instinct bring back the old names .. .23 Coleridge's wistful elegy for the passing of the old divinities is, however, unlikely to have stimulated Wordsworth's experiments with classical fable. In spite of his apparent nostalgia for the old order, Coleridge categorically pronounced pagan myth to be 'exploded',24 and much preferred Hebrew and Christian poetry. As a committed Christian, he could hardly do otherwise. Coleridge wrote to William Sotheby in 1802: It must occur to every Reader that the Greeks in their religious poems address always the Numina Loci, the Genii, the Dryads, the Naiads, &amp;c &amp;c-All natural Objects were dead-mere hollow Statues-but there was a Godkin or Goddessling included in each-In the Hebrew Poetry you find nothing of this poor Stuff-as poor in genuine Imagination as it is mean in Intellect...25 In a more buoyant mood he might have had some sympathy for Elizabeth Barrett Browning's celebration, much later, of the triumph of Christianity: 21 See Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson with the Wordsworth Circle, ed.

Phoebus' chariot course is run! Look up, poets, to the sun! Pan, Pan is dead.26 Wordsworth's emphasis, on the other hand, is quite different. Just because in 'The world is too much with us' the pagan creed is 'outworn' but not 'exploded', it still retains its imaginative force and appeal which can be revived by the poet's visionary power. There is a sense in which it remains a permanent part of man's imaginative inheritance, a folk memory that is never entirely superseded. Like the pagan temples, it lingered on in the imagination long after the old religion had given way to the new. Wordsworth's delight in 'the universal Pan'27 and the other tutelary powers seems in fact to owe little or nothing either to Schiller or to Coleridge, and another source must be found for the new feeling about the pagan gods which enters his poetry around 1803 and reaches full development in The Excur- sion. A likely source can be found, I suggest, in Boccaccio's Latin treatise Genealogia Deorum Gentilium. It is now clear for the first time that the Wordsworths and Coleridge were reading this work together in Italian in 1803 to help Coleridge improve his knowledge of the language before his departure for Malta early the following year.28 What is more, Coleridge's copy of Gen- ealogia degli Dei Pagani (Venetia, 1588) remained in Wordsworth's library for many years, being listed in the manuscript catalogue of his books compiled in 1829; and it was not returned to Derwent Coleridge until after Coleridge's death.29 Wordsworth had known Boccaccio's Decameron much earlier, at Racedown in 1795, but he probably learnt first of Boccaccio's scholarly endeavours as a humanist from Gibbon, who in his account of the early Italian Renaissance described the Genealogia as 'a work, in that age, of stupendous erudition', which the author had 'ostentatiously sprinkled with Greek characters and pass- ages, to excite the wonder and applause of his more ignorant 26 See 'The Dead Pan' (1844) (Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Oxford, 1920), 303-6), based (as she says in the headnote) on a tradition in Plutarch's De Oraculorum Defectu, and excited by reading Schiller's 'Die Gotter Griechenlands'. 27 See 'O'er the wide earth, on mountain and on plain', PIW iii. 131. 28 See Marginalia (Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge), ed.

Neither would Coleridge, who later on was plan- ning a complete edition of Boccaccio's scholarly works, have done so. The Genealogia Deorum Gentilium, a kind of encyclopaedia of classical myth, was one of several treatises which Boccaccio con- tributed in his later years to the revival of learning pioneered by his friend Petrarch. A vast range of classical reading is summarized in fifteen Books under nearly 700 headings, each dealing with a par- ticular figure in ancient mythology. Wordsworth would have found Proteus and Triton discussed under divinities of the ocean in Book VII.31 The myths are allegorized to give, where possible, a moral, and even a Christian sense above their literal or historical meaning, according to a tradition of interpretation going back to classical and patristic times and handed on to the Renaissance, where it received definitive formulation in Bacon's De Sapientia Veterum and in the Preface to Sir John Harington's translation of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (1591), a work well known to Wordsworth: The ancient Poets haue indeed wrapped as it were in their writings diuers and sundry meanings, which they call the sences or mysteries thereof. First of all for the litterall sence (as it were the vtmost barke or ryne) they set downe in manner of an historie, the acts and notable exploits of some persons worthy memorie; then in the same fiction, as a second rine and somewhat more fine, as it were nearer to the pith and marrow, they place the Morall sence, profitable for the actiue life of man, approuing vertuous actions and condemning the contrarie. Manie times also vnder the selfsame words they comprehend some true vndestanding of naturall Philosophie, or sometimes of politike gouernement, and now and then of diuinitie: and these same sences that comprehend so excellent knowledge we call the Allegorie ... 32 The Genealogia helped to ensure the survival of this tradition of classical learning into the Renaissance, before it sank almost without 30 Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ch. 66. 31 Genealogia Deorum Gentilium, ed.

The allegorical reading of myth was as familiar to Ralegh, Burton, or Sir Thomas Browne, as it was to Harington or Milton. Wordsworth had other works on the explication of fables in his library: for example, the Mythologiae sive explicationis fabularum (1586) of Natale Conti (1520-82), the Italian humanist; and Geofroy Linocier's popular .lMythologiae Musanum Libellus (1583).

For, far from being just a compendium of fables, it also offered a justification for their use by the poet. In providing, in the two final Books, an account of the origins of poetry and a defence of the poet's vocation, it went to the heart of some of Wordsworth's central preoccupations. For Boccaccio, the essential subject-matter of ancient poetry was myth, which is alive with the imaginative power in which the value of poetry resides. Poetry 'proceeds from the bosom of God'; it is 'sublime in its effects'; it 'brings forth strange and unheard of creations of the mind'; and thus 'it veils truth in a fair and fitting garment of fiction'.33 Through myth, poetry came to embody the spiritual intuitions of the ancients, and so, wherever it 'first dawned on the world', it was essentially religious in origin; and Boccaccio considers in turn the claims of the Hebrews, the Babylonians, the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, and finally the Greeks, to have invented the art first, without deciding the issue one way or the other. But wherever its true origins lay, poetry sprang from primitive wonderment at the forces of nature which were attributed to divine agencies, and prayers and choric rituals were devised in exalted language to pay honour to them: To strengthen the authority of these songs, they [the Greeks] enclosed the high mysteries of things divine in a covering of words, with the intention that the adorable majesty of such things should not become an object of too common knowledge, and thus fall into contempt. Now since the art thus discovered seemed wonderful and wholly new, they named it, as I have said, from its effect, and called it poetry or poetes, that is, in Latin exquisita locutio; and they who had composed the songs were named poets.34 Thus, as Boccaccio maintains in a parallel discussion in his Life of Dante, theology and poetry 'may be considered to be almost one and the same thing', for Aristotle calls poets 'the first Theologians'.35 Here, Boccaccio is following St Augustine's argument in the City of God that the old gods were deified heroes, or 'principalities and powers' set up in nature according to their Creator's will to serve his purposes, though misunderstood and presented in distorted form by the poets.36 But poets are not quite the same as theologians, and 33 C.

Boccaccio in fact provides what amounts to a commentary on Wordsworth's argument in Book IV of The Excursion, though this may not be obvious at first since the poet's exposition is ordered by his own priorities and somewhat broken up by the demands of a 'conversation poem'. The Wanderer confronts the Solitary's death-wish by arguing that superstition is preferable to apathy, which is contrary to nature but encouraged by scientific or analytic modes of thought, 'Where soul is dead, and feeling hath no place'.38 He goes on to show that, from the beginning of time, man has never lacked some form of spiritual guidance, however imperfect, to nourish the admiration, hope, and love which are innate propensities of the human soul and natural antidotes to the Solitary's moral lethargy. The Wanderer's spirited evocation of the ancient religions is an exemplification of the power of poetry to embody in fable and myth mankind's early attempts to commune with the spirit of nature and to understand its processes and laws. For in the ancient world, 'The imaginative faculty was lord I Of observations natural'.39 Following the stages of Boccaccio's account quite closely, though sometimes drawing on other sources for incidental details,40 Wordsworth begins with the Hebrew religion of 'Jehovah-shapeless Power above all Powers, I Single and one, the omnipresent God',41 revealed in miracles and judgements to the Chosen Race, and goes on to the Persians (Boccaccio's Assyrians), the Babylonians, the Chaldean shepherds and astronomers, and finally 'the lively Grecian', whose anthropomorphic cults Could find commodious place for every God, Promptly received, as prodigally brought From the surrounding countries, at the choice Of all adventurers.

Even 'bewildered pagans' had 'hopes that overstepped the Grave'.45 A little later, the Wanderer, a born poet, again uses 'the vision and the faculty divine' to conjure up the imaginative processes of 'the unenlightened swains of pagan Greece', as they peopled the solitudes of nature with their divinities. All answered to a natural human need or 'a real sentiment' in the words of the Fenwick Note. This time he gives individual examples of the myth-making propensities of the Greeks, as in the herdsman's vision of Apollo which was, according to Benjamin Robert Haydon,46 Keats's favourite passage in the poem: -In that fair clime, the lonely herdsman, On the soft grass through half a summer's day, With music lulled his indolent repose: And, in some fit of weariness, if he, When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear A distant strain, far sweeter than the sounds Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetched, Even from the blazing chariot of the sun, A beardless Youth, who touched a golden lute, And filled the illumined groves with ravishment.47 Wordsworth goes on to account in the same naturalistic terms for the worship of Diana and her nymphs, the naiads of stream and fountain, the oreads of the mountain, and finally the satyrs and Pan: 42 Exc. iv. 721-8. 43 Ibid. 735-40. 44 Ibid. 755. 45 Ibid. 940. 46 In a note in his copy of The Excursion, now in the Cornell University Library. 47 Exc. iv. 851-60.</page><page sequence="12">THE PAGAN GODS OF ANTIQUITY 37 Withered boughs grotesque, Stripped of their leaves and twigs by hoary age, From depth of shaggy covert peeping forth In the low vale, or on steep mountain-side; And, sometimes, intermixed with stirring horns Of the live deer, or goat's depending beard,- These were the lurking Satyrs, a wild brood Of gamesome Deities; or Pan himself, The simple shepherd's awe-inspiring God!48 Such testimonies to the divine presence, and of early man's attempts to understand it, are not to be despised by more sophisticated generations. They are natural responses, however primitive, which carry their own imaginative truth; and the outward rites and forms in which they are embodied are also 'a natural process'. The poem moves on from this excursion into the imaginative life of primitive peoples to other related themes and to a new character, the Pastor, who, speaking in his professional capacity (and not for Wordsworth), brushes aside the 'idle songs of wandering gods, I Pan or Apollo, veiled in human form';49 but not before the Solitary has acknowledged the perennial power of the ancient myths over the imagination.

In The Excursion Wordsworth continued to keep pagan myth alive for poetry, so that the old fables could be a vital source of symbols and poetic idealism to Keats, Shelley, and the Victorians, for many of whom The Excursion was little short of a revelation. Though the scientific study of comparative mythology was already under way in Germany, it is inconceivable that Wordsworth had ever heard of Georg Friedrich Creuzer or Karl MUiller, let alone that he would have 48 Ibid. 879-87. 49 Ibid. vii. 729-30. so Ibid. vi. 545-7. Wordsworth found the pagan gods of pre-Christian Britain too repellent for extended poetic treatment (see Prel. (1805), xii. 320-53; Exc. ix. 682-709; and Ecclesi- astical Sketches (1822), Part I, sonnets III and IV), but in his approach to them he still follows Boccaccio's guidelines. The Ancient Britons were never left entirely without spiritual guidance from their bards, in spite of the 'baleful rites' that had obscured 'Diluvian truths, and patriarchal lore'; and the Druids, though cruel and misguided, had some inkling of the truth.</page><page sequence="13">38 HILL: WORDSWORTH, BOCCACCIO, AND sympathized with their laborious researches had he known of them, and many years were to pass before they made any significant impact on English intellectual life. But we do know how much he deplored the demythologizing history of Niebuhr and the threat to 'those old credulities, to nature dear', the legends of Ancient Rome.51 It was left to the young George Eliot, in her first contribution to the Westminster Review-a discussion of R. W. Mackay's Progress of the Intellect, published a year after Wordsworth's death52--to try to reconcile the spirit of the pagan religions which she had absorbed from The Excursion with the 'advanced' intellectual culture of the new age. Her article implicitly refers back to Wordsworth's ideal pictures of the pagan cults at every turn of the argument. Any theory of the development of the human race towards higher forms of religion must, she implies, leave room for earlier stages, especially for the 'exuberant religious imagination of the Greeks'; and she later rebuked a famous evangelical preacher for his ignorant and patronizing view of Greek mythology.53 The dangers of arid specialization in these matters, divorced from creative imagination and the spur of 'admiration, hope and love' (by which George Eliot herself set such store), are well illustrated in the character of Mr Casaubon in Middlemarch, who is lost in the labyrinth of ancient mythologies to which he vainly seeks the key, 'like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying mentally to construct it as it used to be'.54 He fits exactly Wordsworth's analysis of the mental processes of the esoteric re- searcher, 'lost in a gloom of uninspired research',55 whereas the poet's own purpose had been quite different, to appeal over the heads of the specialists to the sympathies of the general reader. 'One of my principal aims in The Excursion', he explained to Coleridge, 'has been to put the commonplace truths, of the human affections especially, in an interesting point of view; and rather to remind men of their knowledge, as it lurks inoperative and undervalued in their own 51 See the four sonnets 'At Rome' in Memorials of a tour in Italy, 1837 (PW iii. 213-14). 52 Westminster Review, 54 (Jan. 1851), 353-68. 53 Ibid. 64 (Oct. 1855), 445. Writing in 1852 on 'The Lives of the Saints' in the Eclectic Review, James Anthony Froude took much the same view of the pagan religions as George Eliot had done the previous year, no doubt echoing Wordsworth and Thomas Carlyle's first lecture on Heroes and Hero-worship (1841): 'Philosophy has rescued the old theogonies from ridicule; their extravagances, even the most grotesque of them, can now be seen to have their root in an idea, often a deep one, representing features of natural history or of metaphysical speculation ... In their origin, they were the consecration of the first-fruits of knowledge, the expression of a real reverential belief' (Short Studies on Great Subjects (London, 1890), i. 546). s4 Middlemarch, ch. 3.

Here, though apparently unknown to himself, he was closest to his European contemporaries-to Schiller and his followers in Germany, and to Leopardi in Italy who, following the same tradition in Alla primavera, one of the finest of his Canti, also lamented man's loss of mythopoeic vision and estrangement from the vital powers of nature. In conclusion, some related questions deserve brief discussion. Did Wordsworth's Fenwick Note on the use of pagan mythology have a wider reference than might at first appear? Was there any special significance in its date, 1842? And why did he wait as late as that before pronouncing on an issue that was so important to his poetics? Twenty years earlier, in an article57 that was well known in the Wordsworth circle, Hartley Coleridge was already celebrating the return of pagan myth in the poetry of Keats, Shelley, and others, under the stimulus of The Excursion, recommending Greek myth as 'unrivalled in the beauty and simplicity of its forms, the pregnancy of its symbols, and the plastic facility with which it accommodates itself to the fancy and feelings of all mankind'.58 His own sonnets thereafter occasionally draw on Greek myth to some effect,59 echoing perhaps Keats's yearning for the lost innocence of a pagan Arcadia. Was Wordsworth's Fenwick Note meant to sound a warning to the host of minor versifiers (now mercifully forgotten) who, allegedly with his sanction, were busy repopulating their poems with the old mythical personifications? Or did it also imply some tacit recognition that others besides himself, notably Keats and Shelley, had indeed been successful in allying myth with 'real sentiment'? Keats's and Shelley's debt to Wordsworth's poetry has been well documented: Wordsworth's response to theirs, however, is more problematical. His limited acquaintance with Keats has been fully discussed elsewhere, and the details need not be repeated here.60 His s6 Letters: The Middle Years, Part II, 238. s7 H.

While he possessed Keats's first two volumes of poetry, we cannot be sure that he ever saw the 1820 collection, containing Hyperion and the Odes,61 so that, though well aware of Keats's tragic circumstances, Wordsworth may not have come to know his best work well until some years after his death. The case of Shelley is rather different. In spite of their political differences, Wordsworth had much more to say about him and was soon acknowledging his genius. According to a visitor to Rydal Mount in 1826, 'he told us he thought the greatest of modern Geniuses, had he given his powers proper direction, and one decidedly superior to Byron, was Shelley, a young man, author of Queen Mab, who died lately at Rome'.62 He said much the same to Jared Sparks,63 the American historian, and to William Bennett, a Quaker Visitor.64 To his nephew he remarked that 'Shelley is one of the best artists of us all, I mean in workmanship of style',65 and later he described The Cenci to Henry Crabb Robinson as 'the greatest tragedy of the age'.66 Presumably he also saw Shelley's verses in The Keepsake for 1829, as he contributed to the same volume himself. But Wordsworth does not seem to have had the opportunity of studying both poets with the attention they deserved until he acquired the Galignani edition of The Poetical Works of Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats some time after its first appearance in 1829.67 Possibly he learnt more during his visit to Rome in 1837, where he met Joseph Severn68 and may have visited the monuments in the Protestant cemetery- though there is no record of this in his letters. Two years later he 61 The evidence from Wordsworth's library lists is unclear. See Shaver, IWordsworth's Library, 143-4. 62 Letters of John James Tayler, ed. J. H. Thornm (London, 1872), i. 74. 63 H.

It was not until later still, during the parliamentary struggle for copyright reform in 1842, to which he was passionately committed, that he unreservedly gave Keats and Shelley their true valuation in the great tradition of English poetry and enrolled them openly among the immortals.70 When Wordsworth dictated his Fenwick Note on the use of pagan mythology only a few months later, therefore, he cannot have been unmindful of the achievements of Keats and Shelley in extending the use of classical myth in striking ways of their own; and it seems likely that his Note was not only a justification of his own practice since many years before he had written 'The World is too much with us' and The Excursion, but was also meant to register his sense that others had successfully followed his own example in what Keats had held to be one of the wonder-works of the age. 69 Letters: The Later Years, iii. 732.
