No part of Greece is more interesting to the mythologist than Arcadia, the home of beliefs and customs which seem to belong to the earliest strata of Greek religion. Hence Arcadia, with its stone-worship and were-wolves and human sacrifice, has been a kind of happy hunting-ground for the student of folk-lore and anthropology. Fol- lowing quite different methods of interpre- tation, W. Immerwahr has recently pro- duced a valuable monograph on Arcadian religion.1 Immerwahr is an adherent of the ' local' school, who, working on lines laid down by H. D. Miiller, try to disen- tangle the local and tribal elements from the national 'Olympian' religion. The service which Wide, Immerwahr, Tumpel, and others are rendering in this direction cannot be too highly estimated; when the religious systems of every Greek country, city, and sanctuary have been examined as fully as Arcadia has been treated by Immerwahr, or Laconia by Wide, we shall have a proper arrangement of mate- rials for the general study of Greek myth and ritual. In the present learned and lucidly 1 Die Kulte und Mythen Arkadiens. I. Band. Die Arkadischen Kulte. Leipzig. 1891. written volume, M. B6rard, while fully appreciating the work of these scholars in classification, declares himself dissatisfied with the theories which they deduce from their materials. Immerwahr, like Roscher and his collaborators, works on the ' Aryan hypothesis,' assuming that the bulk of Greek mythology was evolved without the aid of foreign influence. M. B6rard, on the other hand, is one of the uncompromising Orientalists, the most prominent of whom is Otto Gruppe. When the second part of Gruppe's great work appears,2 mythologists will be in a better position to examine the theory of wholesale and universal borrowing of Greek religion from the East. In his Essai de Mithode M. B6rard has attacked the very stronghold of the Aryan school. The Arcadians, who lived before the moon, have hitherto been supposed to have developed their religious customs and beliefs with little, if any, direct foreign con- tamination. Their isolation in the centre of the Peloponnese, their pastoral non-maritime life, as well as the many primitive and savage elements in their religion, seem strong argu- ments in favour of the generally accepted theory. It is, indeed, admitted by historians that at some early period the Phoenicians 2 Die griechischen Kulte und Mythen in iihren Beziehungen zu den Orientalischen Religion. Bd. I. 1887. F2</page><page sequence="2">68 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. had trading settlements on the coasts of Greece,1 although the extent of their in- fluence and the date of their occupation cannot be estimated with any certainty. Probably, however, a certain amount of the Semitic religion survived the departure of the Phoenicians from Greece, and became incorporated with the Hellenic religion. Semitic influence has been pointed out in the mythology of Thebes (Cadmus and Europa, Ares and Harmonia, Heracles, &amp;c.), Corinth (Aphrodite, Melicertes), Cythera (Aphrodite), Attica (myths of Theseus' com- bat with the Minotaur and the Marathonian bull, the Amazons, &amp;c.). In the Peloponnese, survivals of Oriental cults have been traced, with more or less probability, at Patrae, Sparta, Amyclae, and Olympia (see Abbott p. 54). But the historians seem to have excepted Arcadia from the sphere of Phoenician influence. At the most, they have suggested that the names of a few Arcadian places (e.g. Macariae, near Megalo- polis) have a Phoenician sound. M. B6rard, however, boldly claims a Semitic origin for nearly all the Arcadian gods with the ritual and mythology attached to them. Pan and Selene alone appear to be excluded from his list, as primitive 'Pelasgic' deities.2 In an interesting introduction he urges that the theory of a Phoenician settlement in the heart of Arcadia presents no difficulty; his arguments are partly philological and rely on the supposed traces of Semitic names of persons and places in Arcadia;3 but none of these names are very conclusive, and we may reasonably doubt the direct Phoenician origin of Macareus (son of Lycaon), the rivers Syros and Malous, and some other place-names for which the same claim is made. M. B rard argues that there is no in- herent improbability in his assumption that a Phoenician trade-route passed through Arcadia, the foreign merchandise being exchanged for Arcadian cattle, timber, and slaves. The traders went up along the Eurotas and followed the course of the Alpheus to the sea, thus skirting Mt. Lycaeus. The first section of the book (pp. 49-93) is devoted to the principal god of this region-Zeus Lycaeus-whom the author identifies with a Phoenician Baal. He draws attention to the following points of similarity in the character of the two deities. (1) Human sacrifice is inseparable from the cult of Zeus Lycaeus, and may be compared with the like sacrifices to Semitic gods (e.g. to Melcart at Tyre, &amp;c.). To this it may be replied that human sacrifice is not confined to the Semites, but is a common feature of savage religions. (2) No image of Zeus is mentioned at any of his three sanctuaries, on Mt. Lycaeus, at Megalopolis, and at Tegea. This is an ex silentio argu- ment; but granting that the god was worshipped in the form of a stone, as M. Berard suggests, it does not by any means follow that this stone was a Phoe- nician betyl. Stock and stone worship is so universal that it is dangerous to draw any ethnological conclusions from its oc- currence, unless, as in the case of the Paphian Aphrodite, worshipped under the form of a conical stone, the Semitic origin of the cult can be proved on other grounds. (3) Zeus Lycaeus had no vao's or temple proper, but only a rE'/EVOg and /3oyo'. M. Berard gets rid of the difficulty in Thuc. v. 16 ('3o-rv 7Tr olK&amp;l9 TO LEpOV 7TOTE TOy At 9 olKovvra) by the explanation that Pleistoanax occupied half the house belonging to the rEoEVo: ' l'autre moitie fut r'servee sans doute pour le materiel, le personnel, ou les commodites du culte.' He compares Thuc. i. 134 E' otK/7/LL 01 /E-a .C78 Ov To70V EpOVE9 EXOWv. The same criticism applies to this argu- ment; the absence of a temple may be a common feature of Semitic worship, but almost any page of Pausanias shows that an altar, without a temple, sufficed for the ritual of genuinely Greek gods, if the Orientalists will allow that any god is genuinely Greek. (4) There is more weight in the argument which M. B6rard draws from Pausanias' description of the altar on Mt.

At Megalo- polis, the precinct of Zeus contained two altars, two tables, and two eagles., Both at Megalopolis and on Mt. Lycaeus the precinct was an 3pawrov; the author com- pares the sanctity of certain mountains, among the Semites, as Sinai and Carmel, but the idea is, of course, by no means peculiar to the Semitic peoples. 1 Mover's Phoenizier, pp. 47 ff., Curtius I. ch. ii., Duncker Hist.

B6rard has made out a strong case for his Semitic theory, as far as Zeus Lycaeus is concerned; and if Zeus Laphystius (at Alos and in Boeotia) and Zeus Apomyius (at Olympia) are often identified with Phoenician Baals, there is at least as much probability for the same identification in the case of the Arcadian god. And yet there are serious difficulties, which should prevent us from too hastily accepting M. Be- rard's theory. From a historical point of view, it might be thought curious that no hint has been preserved of the foreign origin of the cult, as in the story of Cadmus; nor is there any philological evidence, such as has been adduced for the Oriental origin of Melicertes (i.e. Melcarth), Heracles (I Ar- chal), or Zeus Apomyius (Baal Zebub). For we can hardly doubt that Zeus Lycaeus means the Wolf-Zeus or at least Zeus of the Wolf-mountain, although M. Berard and Immerwahr both favour the old derivation from ,/luc, 'ILight-god.' But it must be allowed that the Wolf-god might still be Phoenician, as Robertson Smith (Rel. of the Semites, p. 88, new edition, quoted by Be- rard) shows that the belief in were-wolves was held by the Semites. I have examined the case of Zeus Lycaeus at some length, because the theory of his Semitic origin is at least tenable, though it would appear to be by no means proved. But the author is not content with an isolated Baal; he argues (p. 93) that Semitic deities were worshipped in trinities, consisting of a god, a goddess, his wife, and a young god, their son; e.g. at Sidon we find Baal Astarte and Eshmun, at Tyre, Baal Astarte and Melcarth. The origin of most of the Arcadian gods and goddesses is to be sought for in one or other of the members of this trinity. Again, each member of the Semitic trinity has a triple aspect; 1 but the Greeks formed a separate deity out of each separate aspect or title, so that Zeus, Dionysos, and Poseidon are really one and the same Baal. Hera, Aphrodite, Demeter, and Artemis are all forms of the great goddess in her celestial terrestrial and infernal aspects. The young god (Adonis, Thammuz, Eshmun, or Melcarth) divides his functions and powers between Hermes, Heracles, and Asclepius. The nomina have become numina with a vengeance. Even the 'black Demeter' of Phigaleia resolves herself into an Astarte. The transforma- tion was effected by the following steps. Originally Astarte rode on horseback, in her aspect as a warrior goddess. Now Syrian, like Egyptian gods, often bore the head of their sacred animal en guise de coifure, e.g. Aphrodite carries a dove on her head in Cyprus; M. B6rard therefore concludes (p. 120) that the human face of the goddess gradually disappeared, and the head of the animal descended on to the shoulders of the goddess. This theory seems hardly likely to supersede the explanation of the anthro- pologist, that the horse-head is the last relic of a goddess who was incarnate in the form of a horse. We need not be surprised, after this, to find from the author's Intro- duction (pp. 44-45) that he has a very qualified admiration for the methods of folk- lorists. In fact, M. Berard has tried to prove too much; he has been carried away by his anxiety to find a place for each Arcadian deity in some aspect of a 'triple triad ' of Oriental mythology. Let us con- sider, for example, his treatment of Le dieu fils. His theory, as I have already men- tioned, is that different characteristics of one Semitic god produced Hermes, Heracles and Asclepius. 'Arcadia,' he says, 'is the country of Heracles; it is the scene of a great number of his exploits, and the Arcadians are his usual companions in all his enterprises.' 2 Now it may be granted that Heracles became readily acclimatized in Arcadia; but there can be no doubt that he was a Theban god before he became Arcadian: in other words Heracles, like Aphrodite, may have been originally Semitic, but he was introduced into Arcadia after he had become hellenized; his presence in Arcadia has nothing to do with the assumed Phoenician occupation of that district. With regard to the Arcadian Hermes and Asclepius, there is no authority for the theory of their Oriental origin. Hermes in Arcadia was primarily a phallic shepherd- god, giver of increase to the flocks and of luck to men; if he was borrowed from the Phoenicians his Semitic prototype must also have been a god of flocks and fertility. Yet we are asked to believe that ' il repr&amp;- sente, dans le pantheon hellenique, une conception tres voisine du Verbe s6mitique,' p. 276. Such points of similarity as may exist between Hermes and Merodach (e.g. both were patrons of letters) are no proof that the Arcadians borrowed Hermes from the Babylonian god. A likeness to Mero- dach might be traced in the Olympian or Pan-hellenic character of Hermes, but it certainly cannot be extracted from his Arcadian aspect. This likeness is probably 1 P. 174. 2 P. 272</page><page sequence="4">70 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. accidental: but granted that the conception of a Merodach or a Nebo may have influenced the Greek Hermes, the fact that his special Arcadian characteristics are not those of his assumed original proves that the Arca- dians did not borrow him directly from foreign sources. Lastly, it is true that Asclepius is sometimes a juvenile deity and is generally affiliated to Apollo; so M. B6rard calls him a 'dieu fils.' But, as Miss Har- rison points out,1 this idea was only de- veloped when the cult of Asclepius came into conflict with that of the Dorian Apollo. It was necessary to find a connexion between the two gods of healing; so the old dream- oracle god gave way to Apollo, and became his son. Asclepius, moreover, was not originally Arcadian, as M. BBrard appears to claim,2 but Thessalian. The conclusions which the author draws from his study of Arcadian religion are summed up on p. 323. He distinguishes three periods in its development :-- (1) It appears that originally there was a simple Pelasgic religion in which Pan and Selene, the sun and moon, were the only gods worshipped. (2) A Semitic religion succeeded this primitive nature-worship: Zeus Lycaeus took the place of Pan upon his mountain. (3) Hellenic period. The Greeks ration- alized and analysed the Oriental religion and so produced the anthropomorphic pan- theon of the historic Arcadians. The 'Semitic period' cannot be con- sidered as proved, or even probable, if the above criticisms on M. B6rard's arguments are accepted. As to the 'Pelasgic period' we know as little about the religion as about the race of the Pelasgi. There is no objection to calling Pan Pelasgic if that term is preferred to ' Hellenic.' But a protest must be made, when not only M. B4rard 3 but Immerwahr 4 follow Preller 5 and the old school of mythologists in assuming a solar origin for Pan. For if Mannhardt did not write in vain, he surely proved beyond dispute that Pan, like the Satyrs and Fauns of Italy, the Urisks of Scotland, and the Ljeschie of Russia, was a wood spirit conceived of in the form of a goat.6 But, as there seems to be a perpetual recrudescence of the solar theory in connexion with Pan, in spite of Mann- hardt and Mr. Frazer, it may not be useless to examine the arguments which Immerwahr and his supporters bring forward. Pan has his flocks in Arcadia; Helios and Apollo have their herds; therefore Pan is a sun- god. But Pan, as the god of a shepherd people, naturally protects the flocks of his worshippers. The herds of Helios or Apollo are no parallel, whether they belong specially to the Sun-god, or whether (as in Hom. hymn. Mere. 71, 8Oiv paKadpowv fo'es) they are the common property of the gods, and are merely tended by Apollo. Again Pan is the son of Ether, according to one tradition (Mnaseas); but this does not appear to be an early genealogy; and indeed the parentage of the god is too indis- criminate to draw any conclusions there- from. His father is Uranus, Zeus, Hermes, or Apollo; his mother Callisto, Oenoe, Penelope or the daughter of Dryops, ac- cording to various accounts (see Preller- Robert, where an even longer list is given). His epithet aicdXo in Macrob. Sat. i. 23 may refer to the sun in the mind of Macrobius himself, but is certainly no proof of an original solar character. Immerwahr points out that Helios and Pan were worshipped together at Sicyon; but unless the men of Sicyon, like Pentheus, saw two suns, this fact might as easily show that Pan was not the sun. It may be true that Helios and Apollo were little worshipped in Ar- cadia,7 but this is purely negative reasoning and does not concern Pan; nor is a developed sun-worship by any means universal. The solar theorists make much of the fact that Pan and Selene were worshipped together in Arcadian caves s and that Pan won the love of Selene by an artifice.9 But both Pan and Selene ' inhabit caves, so that there is nothing wonderful that the two deities should have a cave in common. I find that this obvious explanation is also given by Roscher (Selene, p. 151), who suggests an additional link between Pan and Selene; in his view, Pan is merely a divine counterpart of the Arcadian shepherd- hunter, and is connected with the moon because a moon-lit night is favourable for watching the flocks and for nocturnal hunting expeditions." f Myth. and Mon. of Ancient Athens, p. 324, 2 P. 270. 3 Pp. 61-62 &amp;c, 4 op. cit. p. 204. 6 Preller-Robert 1.2 pp. 738 ff. 6 Antike Wald- und Feldkulte, ch. 3, 7 Immerwahr, p. 205; B rard, p. 62. 8 Porphyr. de Antr. 20. 9 Macrob.

M. B rard's reconstruction of Pelasgic beliefs is as du- bious as his theory of a ' Phoenician period,' influencing the whole of Arcadian ritual and mythology. E. E. SIKES,</page></plain_text>
