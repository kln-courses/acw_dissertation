<plain_text><page sequence="1">Climatic Challenges and Changes: A Little Ice Age Period Response to Adversity?The Vickers Focus Forager/Horticulturalists Move On B.A. Nicholson, Dion Wiseman, Scott Hamilton and Sylvia Nicholson Vickers focus people are believed to have practiced a lifeway based upon foraging and gardening in the Tiger Hills, a glacial-moraine upland, in southwestern Manitoba. It has also been argued that Vickers focus society was more socially complex than earlier hunter-gatherer groups in the region relying almost exclusively on bison hunting. There is evidence to suggest limited stratification in Vickers focus culture and clear evidence of a widespread exchange network that brought a variety of exotic materials and finely made ceramic vessels into the Lowton site. Other smaller seasonal sites have been identified nearby. These have been interpreted as satellites of the Lowton site. These people appeared as immigrants in the area circa A.D. 1400. Sometime around A.D. 1450 they left the Tiger Hills and have been identified further west in the Lauder Sandhills around 100 years later, following an intensive foraging lifeway. There is evidence they had begun to exploit bison more intensively and this trend is further intensified in the Sanderson site in southeastern Saskatchewan, where a full-fledged bison hunting economy was fol lowed. The cause for their relocation and altered subsistence strategy is believed to have resultedfrom a sudden, drastic cold spike during the Little Ice-Age. Keywords: horticulture, climate change, settlement patterns, environmental biodiversity, subsis tence change Since 1985, the senior author has been re searching a series of sites in southwestern Manitoba, characterized by an unusual mix of ce ramic wares that indicate influences from the East ern Woodland cultures of southern Minnesota/ northern Iowa and from the Middle Missouri area (Nicholson 1991:169). It is this unique assemblage of ceramics that forms the diagnostic basis for the Vickers focus, which is considered to be a part of the Plains Village phenomenon. The ceramics fit well with the Scattered Village phase materials described by Ahler (1993:67) and with Scattered Village phase materials from the Horner-Kane site (Gregg 1994:6.24). In addition, these sites are typi cally much larger than earlier hunter/gatherer sites of Blackduck people in the region and include a much richer assemblage of exotic lithic materials and other artifacts such as catlinite elbow pipes and, in particular, the ceramics which include Knife River Fine ware and both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessel-rim effigy heads (Nicholson 1994:106-110). There is also evidence at some of these sites to suggest that these groups supple mented their lifeway with small-scale horticultural B.A. Nicholson - Department of Anthropology, Brandon University, Brandon MB R7A 6A9 E-mail: nicholson@brandonu.ca Dion Wiseman - Department of Geography, Brandon University, Brandon MB E-mail: wiseman@brandonu.ca Scott Hamilton - Department of Anthropology Lakehead University, Thunder Bay ON P7B 5E1 E-mail: shamilton@lakeheadu.ca Sylvia Nicholson - SCAPE Project, Brandon University, Brandon MB R7A 6A9 E-mail: nicholsons@brandonu.ca Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 51, No. 199, pp. 325-333, 2006 325</page><page sequence="2">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 activity, based upon the occurrence of horticultural implements including stone and bone hoes (Nicholson 1991:169, 1994:107; Nicholson and Malainey 1995:97-98). Recently, the recovery of corn phytoliths and starch grains from ceramic resi dues has shown conclusively that corn was, in fact, consumed at several Vickers focus sites in the re gion (Surette 2005; Boyd et al. 2006). The sites are located in out-of-the-way areas on warm, well watered soils suitable for small-scale horticulture and in areas that would have provided a wide vari ety of seasonal resources to semi-sedentary groups (Nicholson and Hamilton 2001:65-67). In this paper we address the question of the reasons for the disappearance of the Vickers focus people from the Tiger Hills area and their appear ance later in the Lauder Sandhills to the west. We also discuss changes in the lifeways and subsis tence strategies accompanying this translocation. THE VICKERS FOCUS In a recent interview, Mr. Dave Daniels an Elder from the Long Plain First Nation, recalled that he had been told by his father of a group of agrarian Indians that had once lived in the Tiger Hills. In the interview, Mr. Scribe asked, "Do you know any stories relating to this area?" Mr. Daniels replied: In that area there, years ago, my father talk (sic) about a different type of Indian that lived there. It wasn't the Ojibway, it wasn't the Dakota, he called them Ichininewuk. I gathered from what he was try ing to tell me was that these were an agrarian people, an agricultural society. They lived in along south facing banks of large hills. This was because that's where the sun was the warmest and that is where they would be protected from the north winds. He called them a special name because they were a peaceful people. Other people also picked on them a lot. He did talk about them living in the Tiger Hills area. I believe he was talking about the Mandan Indians. My father also talked about a fair skinned people there as well. I remembered him describing the people, where they were living and talking about the Pembina River area and south to the Turtle Mountains area (Oral Interview of Mr. Dave Daniels by Mr. Brian Scribe 2001). These people had selected sites on south fac ing slopes where the soil would be warm and where there would be shelter from north winds. Mr. Daniels referred to them as Ichininewuk and noted that they were "picked on" by other groups. This description fits well with the Vickers focus sites in the Tiger Hills. He thought that they might have been Mandan but the Vickers focus ceramics fit more closely with a Hidatsa connection (Nicholson and Hamilton 2001:69). The term Ichininewuk may be a rendering of the Ojibwa term generally writ ten as kicci-iniwak or gichi-iniwak, which means "big men". These latter spelling variants are used by linguists in Manitoba and Minnesota respec tively (Paul Voorhis, personal communication 1997). Several Vickers focus archaeological sites have been identified in southwestern Manitoba, grouped into two regional clusters that appear to be sequential rather than contemporaneous. The earlier cluster is associated with till based silt outwash deposits in the Tiger Hills, east of the Pembina Trench. The second cluster is associated with post-glacial sand dune areas on outwash lacus trine sands in the Glacial Lake Hind Basin (GLHB). The Tiger Hills sites form the eastern cluster. The Lowton and Lovstrom sites are located within these uplands and the Randall site is located on the till plain, south of the Pembina River (Figure 1). All of these sites are situated on warm, sandy/ silt soils at some distance from major waterways and are dependent on potholes as water sources (Nicholson and Hamilton 2001). The warm, fa vorable locations of these sites and the presence of horticultural implements in the artifact assem blages supports the horticultural hypothesis, indi cating the use of small-scale horticulture as a part of the Vickers subsistence economy in this eastern cluster (Nicholson 1991,1994,1996). These sites appear to be contemporaneous with each other and radiocarbon (14C) dating indicates that they were occupied circa A.D. 1400-1450 (Table 1). The second cluster of sites is dominated by those in the Makotchi-Ded Dontipi locale, located on the southwestern edge of the Lauder Sandhills in the GLHB, and underlain by the Oak Lake Aqui fer (Figure 1). Makotchi-Ded Dontipi is a Dakota phrase meaning "the place where we live". The combination of local, high topographic relief and presence of a water table near the ground surface has created a diverse ecotone with a high resource potential for hunter-gatherer and forager subsis tence strategies (Hamilton and Nicholson 1999).

However, there is no evidence of the practice of horticulture in any of these western sites. Similarly, the pattern of site distribution in the western locale and the functional artifact assem blages, lacking in horticultural implements, differs significantly from that of Vickers focus sites in the eastern section of the Pembina trench. Similarly, these western sites contain little in the way of ex otic materials such as catlinite. While the pottery recovered in these western sites are clearly Vickers focus materials similar to the vessels from the Lowton type site, there is no exotic pottery such as Knife River Fine ware or effigy heads on vessel rims (Nicholson 1991, 1994). Radiocarbon (14C) dating indicates occupation of these sites circa A.D. 1600, about 100-150 years later than the Tiger Hills sites (Table 1). For both the eastern and western site clusters, high levels of plant and animal biodiversity, rela tive to the surrounding prairies, characterize the areas in which individual Vickers focus sites, as well as the larger clusters of sites, are situated (Hamilton and Nicholson 1999:8-14; Nicholson and Hamilton 2001:54-57). The Tiger Hills uplands are composed of re cession and end moraine deposits. A till plain ex tends to the south and west, with a proglacial lake plain to the north and east. The Tiger Hills up lands themselves are characterized by till outcrops, internal outwash plains and areas of high relief and poor internal drainage. This varied topography re sults in numerous ponds and small lakes and a di verse range of microhabitats. These include aspen/ oak forest, balsam poplar/willow forest, meadows, marsh and open grassland. Directional exposure (aspect), local water resources, and soil type de termine the nature of these microhabitats. The Vickers focus sites in this area are typically located adjacent to large potholes on medium textured sandy silt soils with a southern aspect. The western sites in the Makotchi-Ded Dontipi locale are situated on sand plains adjacent to dune fields in the GLHB. These sand deposits are un derlain by the Oak lake aquifer, which lies close to the surface over most of this area, and supports numerous shallow lakes and ponds. The area is a mosaic of marshland, xeric sand plain and dune fields, with aspen-oak forest being commonly found in the duned sections. In some of the lower sections, a riverine type gallery forest with ash and balsam poplar is found. Prior to the advent of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s, American elm was a prominent species in these gallery forests as well. As is the case with the Tiger Hills, this environ ment is characterized by a wide range of micro habitats and a high degree of local biodiversity within the surrounding mixed-grass prairie envi ronment. Within both of these areas, there are continu ous environmental gradients resulting in a much greater diversity of resources for forager-horticul tural dependent groups than in the surrounding prairie. The term ecotone, as used in this paper, reflects this understanding of the environmental variability and resource richness of these locales (Nicholson 1987:44-55). CHANGES IN THE VICKERS FOCUS ADAPTIVE STRATEGY The resource potential in both of these areas is high and foraging and/or horticulture could be a favored adaptive strategies in either situation. However, the Vickers focus people followed sig nificantly differing strategies in the GLHB than in the Tiger Hills. The ceramics indicate that the same group of people occupied both locales. The point of interest is that a successful, and likely seden tary village culture, that followed a horticultural and foraging lifeway, abandoned their home terri tory and moved to another area that was also marked by a high level of biodiversity. This move was followed by a scaled down, seasonal village settlement pattern focused on a forager economy with no indications of horticultural practice. The only apparent exception to this "rule of change" in the western cluster is the undated Johnas site where a probable bison scapula hoe and a stone hoe were recovered as surface finds. This site is the most northerly site that has been identified in the west ern cluster and may be earlier in time than the other sites in this cluster. The Johnas site is located in a cultivated field and no radiocarbon dates are avail able. The seasonal occupations of the western sites indicated a changed pattern of resource exploita tion and these sites are all smaller than the central Lowton site in the eastern cluster. The faunal di versity in the western sites indicates that the for 328</page><page sequence="5">Nicholson, Wiseman, Hamilton, and Nicholson The Little Ice Age and Vickers Focus ager part of the Tiger Hills adaptation remained in place but there was a shift to a central place strat egy from a center based settlement pattern (Nicholson and Hamilton 1997:39). The term center based refers to a settlement strat egy where a large, extended occupation village was established to serve as "headquarters" for more short term, satellite, or task-specific resource extraction settlements. The term central place refers to a settle ment strategy where a seasonal village was strategi cally placed and from which short-term, resource extraction task groups were dispatched into the sur rounding area. A center base would typically be occupied for more than a year and a central place would typically be chosen for seasonal extraction, although it might be reoccupied within a relatively short span of years, depending upon local availabil ity of such materials as firewood, fresh water, plants, etc. Both systems allow for larger population ag gregations than are typically represented in sites left by earlier hunter-gatherers. The earlier sites are consistent with microband or extended family so cial groupings. This strategy is supplemented by large macroband sites when these smaller groups come together for communal resource extraction, determined by the seasonal abundance of a particu lar resource. Examples would be boreal forest sea sonal fishing sites, related to spawning runs or com munal bison hunts in the late fall and early winter on the plains (Nicholson and Hamilton 1997:39). In the Makotchi-Ded Dontipi locale, warm season occupations such as the Vera site are still characterized by bison bone but they also contain a diversity of other summer species including turtle and avian materials (Playford 2004). There are also smaller numbers of lithics - normally associ ated with hunting - and a large number of ceram ics, utilized in the processing of a wide range of foods. At wintering sites such as Jackson (Playford 2001) there is an increased amount of comminuted bison bone and large numbers of lithic tools, par ticularly projectile points. There is also a small bison kill at the north end of this site, indicating a local beginning for the adoption of mass kill tech nology. Similarly, the Sanderson site near Estevan contains Vickers focus ceramics and huge amounts of bison bone, suggesting a full adaptation to mass killing of bison. However, the presence of a wide range of other species in this site indicates that the ancestral foraging strategies were still followed to some degree (Magee 1997). The progression of the Vickers focus subsistence strategy, following their abandonment of the Tiger Hills, moved from foraging/horticulture with seasonal resource ex traction sites to extended, task group foraging and finally, to a full fledged bison procurement. economy over a period of about 100 years. Why did this happen? The first issue in ad dressing this question is, why did these Vickers focus forager/horticulturists leave the rich environ ment of the Tiger Hills for Makotchi-Ded Dontipi in the Glacial Lake Hind Basin and the second is, why did they give up the surplus producing horti cultural component of their subsistence strategy when they moved to an area that, all things being equal, would have been satisfactory for small-scale horticulture as well. The answers may lie in the fact that all things were not equal at the time when they left the Tiger Hills. THE EXODUS FROM THE TIGER HILLS TO MAKOTCHI-DED DONTIPI In keeping with the statement by Elder Dave Daniels that the Ichininewuk were "picked on", it may be that they were persecuted into leaving the Tiger Hills. However, this does not account for their failure to continue gardening in a new area that would have readily supported this practice. The possible explanation for both issues - aban doning the Tiger Hills and cessation of horticul tural practice - may be found in a cataclysmic, short term, climate change event, recorded in tree rings around the northern hemisphere. In two recent articles (Marine/ al. 1998; 1999), temperatures for the last 1000 years in the north ern Hemisphere are presented as a 38-year rolling average (Figure 2). The coldest period in that 1000 year interval falls shortly after A.D. 1450 and co incides with disappearance of the Vickers focus people from their agricultural village complex in the Tiger Hills. Even with the smoothing effect of the rolling 38-year averaging, this period stands out as a dramatic, negative temperature spike. A previous, and less severe cold spike, circa A.D. 1350, marked the start of the "Little Ice Age" that continued intermittently until accelerated by the dramatic cold episode in the mid-1450s. The "Little Ice Age" did not end until the 1890s, when there was a dramatic upturn in mean temperature (Fig ure 2). In an earlier article, Nicholson and Hamilton (2001:69) noted that a cataclysmic volcanic erup 329</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 51, NO. 199, MEMOIR 38, 2006 -,-,-,-j-,-,-,-1-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-.-n _ Reconstruction (AD 1000 to 1980) ] - RMon^^^ 1998\ I : &lt; llfW Pi I WI'll ?] ' H ' ffffTl ?|hH 1 jiff I IfP i "* I I n ' 1 1 'hi sHPHf' i' *ff xfp 1 |i| * i i H - \ Itm m " I ii* - II \ ! s iWm f 11 - 1-01 ? ? ? ?

The effects of this cold episode are re corded in tree rings from northern California, Eu rope and China. This severe, short-term event co incides with an intensification of the cool Neo Boreal period, and would have made an already deteriorating growing season unsuitable for the cultivation of imported cultigens like corn. Fagan (2000:84) notes that deteriorating climatic condi tions during the period 1419 to 1459 led to fam ines and, "By 1440, wine growing had virtually disappeared in Britain. Only the vineyards at Ely in eastern England persisted until 1469 before they too, ceased operation after years of producing sour, unripe juice." (Fagan 2000:84). This severe cli matic event also coincides closely with an oral tra dition recounting the arrival of the Awatixa Hidatsa at Knife River after having lost their corn. Inter estingly, the archaeological evidence supports this late arrival of the Hidatsa at the Knife River vil lages. These dates also agree with terminal dates for the Scattered Village complex (Ahler et al. 1991) and the disappearance of the Vickers focus from the eastern section of the Souris-Pembina/ Tiger Hills area. It would appear that this environ mental disaster might well have ended the horti cultural phase of Plains Village occupations in southern Manitoba. These comparatively cold, short season con ditions would have been particularly stressful for Vickers focus people attempting to maintain hor ticultural production in the extreme northeastern Plains. It may be that an initial, limited horticul tural success in the region ended with a series of cold, short summers that prevented the harvesting and drying of seed corn, with the last crops being consumed as "green corn" or simply lost due to unseasonable killing frosts in the late spring or summer. Following the withdrawal or relocation of these villagers, the Tiger Hills and Pembina Moun 330</page><page sequence="7">Nicholson, Wiseman, Hamilton, and Nicholson The Little Ice Age and Vickers Focus tain (Figure 1) became a virtual "no-mans-land" exploited by several groups but unclaimed or unclaimable by any of them. This condition still prevailed when Northwest Company fur trader Alexander Henry the Younger established a trad ing post at Park River in 1805 (Gough 1992). He notes in his journal that the Ojibwa and the Sioux, with Metis also hunting into the area, contested the area. However, he also notes that none of these groups was able to gain ascendancy and physical control of this game-rich region. With horticulture no longer being practical, the Vickers focus people would have had to inten sify their foraging activity to make up the shortfall created by loss of their garden production. How ever, having lived at the Lowton site for a number of years and, having established logistical camps in the surrounding area, it is likely that the avail able subsistence resources were already depleted and unlikely to rebound under a more intensified regime of foraging. The times of abundance and a surplus producing economy that brought exotic goods to their village were over. The inevitable answer would have been to move on to a new, eco logically rich homeland where the natural resources had not been depleted by intensive localized ex ploitation and where an intensification of the for aging aspect of their subsistence strategy could be implemented. The Vickers focus sites in the Makotchi-Ded Dontipi locale reflect these changes rather clearly. Two sites in particular demonstrate the center based seasonal pattern. These are the Vickers focus occupations at the Jack son site and the Vera site. These sites fall closely within the same C14 win dow, circa A.D. 1600 (Table 1). In addition, some of the ceramics are suf ficiently similar to suggest that the same individual may have decorated them (Figure 3). The Jackson site rep resents a cold season occupation and the Vera site represents a warm sea son occupation. This indicates that the Vickers focus people remained in the area but moved their campsites accord ing to local resource availability and abundance. This is consistent with the central place model mentioned above. THE MAKOTCHI-DED DONTIPI SEASONAL ADAPTIVE STRATEGY The analysis of faunal materials from the Jack son site demonstrates that it is a cold season site, occupied from November until April (Playford 2001:95). This site is characterized by a faunal assemblage dominated by bison, and includes fe tal remains. Projectile points are numerous as well as other classes of lithic tools, including bifaces and scrapers. These are tools typically associated with bison hunting and the processing of meat and hides. Lithic debitage is abundant but there is little in the way of cores, and the lithic flakes that are present are relatively small and include large num bers of rejuvenation flakes. These observations indicate that lithic material was in short supply. This would be consistent with a season when the ground (i.e. quarry sites) was frozen. At the north end of this site there is a small bison kill indicat ing, perhaps, that these people were appropriating the lore and technology for mass kills. The conjoinable base of a projectile point was recov ered from the kill area while the distal end section was recovered in a processing area of the site (Belsham 2003:193-194). This indicates that both of these areas were contemporary. The faunal remains from the kill site indicate I PI Lowton Site Jackson Site Vera Site 0 5 cm Figure 3.

However, the scatter of butchered bone over the entire site, representing elements that are typical of second ary butchering, indicates that most of the kills were made at some distance from the site. The smash ing of long-bone ends, rich in red marrow, indi cates that bone grease extraction was conducted here as well. The overall artifact assemblage sug gests a social group with full gender representa tion. The Vera site, in contrast, is a warm season occupation. Bison still dominate the assemblage but the site inhabitants did not utilize dietary in significant muscles as seen at the Jackson site (Playford and Nicholson: this volume). There are full term fetal specimens (Playford 2004) as well as a first phalanx from a neonate bison calf with a light formation of cortical bone. There are also warm season species including turtle and avian remains. The lithics contain few stone tools, with projectile points being relatively scarce. In con trast, there is a large ceramic assemblage compa rable to the Jackson site. The change in relative abundance between lithics and ceramics is consis tent with a warm season occupation, when fewer people would be at the site, possibly relying heavily on vegetal foodstuffs as opposed to a regular and abundant supply of meat. This assemblage indi cates a strong female gender component and a weakly represented male gender component. This would be consistent with a base camp composed primarily of females and young children. There is no clear indication of the presence of elderly people but this would be an expected component where young hunters and young, childless women would be in the field hunting and processing bison at some distance from base camp. CONCLUSIONS The picture that emerges is one of significant change for Vickers focus people after they aban doned their homeland in the Tiger Hills. The Tiger Hills sites indicate the presence of a large central village, the Lowton site, supported by a scatter of logistical villages that likely accumulated small surpluses to support a large wintering population at the Lowton site. This larger aggregation would have improved the defensive/bargaining position of people holding a small wintering surplus. The abundance of luxury goods at the Lowton site (Nicholson 1991, 1994) indicates a sizeable trade or exchange network that could have been based, in part, upon this surplus. Sometime around 1455 1465, the Vickers focus people abandoned the Ti ger Hills area. Subsequently, the picture that emerges is one of significant change for Vickers focus people after they abandoned their homeland in the Tiger Hills. It appears likely that the reason for this exodus lies in a drastic short-term change in the climate, possibly as the result of catastrophic volcanic activity in the south Pacific region. Following the move to Makotchi-Ded Dontipi, the lifeway is quite different. Aside from some non-local lithic material, there is little that can be construed as exotic or luxury goods. The sites are more transient, shifting to seasonal occupations from the extended occupation present at the Lowton site. While there is sufficient faunal di versity to suggest that intensive foraging was in place, the indications are that the western Vickers focus people, at the Jackson site at least, were adapting themselves to a dependency on the vast herds of bison that drifted in from the surrounding plains. Perhaps the greatest lesson to be drawn from the Vickers experience is the resiliency that these people displayed. Having traveled to a new home land, well to the north of their places of origin in the western margins of the Eastern Woodlands of the present U.S., these people established them selves in the Tiger Hills as forager-horticulturists. They modified their practices to fit the opportuni ties that the new land provided and met the ac companying challenges. Then, faced with a cli matic environmental catastrophe, well beyond their control, they cut their losses and moved on. Simi larly, the record of change, provided by the Makotchi-Ded Dontipi sites in the Glacial Lake Hind Basin, provides a fascinating record of their evolution from a forager subsistence strategy to wards a full-fledged bison hunting economy as they continued their travels westward. There is also ceramic evidence to indicate that some of these people moved south to the Middle Missouri area, by way of Devils Lake (Gregg 1994:6.1-6.21), to become the Hidatsa of historic times.
