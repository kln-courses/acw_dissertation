<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIAL GROUPINGS: THE TERMINOLOGY OF KINSHIP HISTORIANS WERE FAMILIAR WITH SOCIAL STRATIFICATION LONG BEFORE Max Weber and other sociologists tried to tell them what it was and how it should be seen in the context of their own particular studies; and those trained in the English pragmatic tradition have, with rare if notable exceptions, continued to write about society and its component groups at various stages of the past as if Weber had never existed - partly from a fear, perhaps, of being mistaken for Marxists. In the opening years of this century his earlier work was both familiar to and appreciated by Professor (later Sir) Paul Vinogradoff; and there is much in the latter's Oxford Inaugural Lecture (on Maine) and in The Growth of the Manor that would lead us to suppose that a considerable part of Weber's wider-ranging later work, with its emphasis on the complex typology of the forms of social action and the limited range of responses available to both individuals and groups, would be equally congenial to him.' But if Vinogradoff's Chair of Jurisprudence had a refining effect on his thought and writing, it may also have had a restricting or inhibiting one. The medievalists who learnt from him were certainly for the most part uninterested in sociological ideas: the revealingly-titled Studies in Social and Legal History which Vinogradoff initiated and edited are overwhelmingly institutional in approach, concerned with the external forms of society, with its statics rather than its dynamics.2 Social historians of recent years who have convinced themselves that social groups and their interaction are only worth studying if the primary evidence can be quantified and subjected to statistical inquiry have necessarily left the Early Middle Ages untouched since the material that can be 1 P.

Vinogradoff is one of the very few English medievalists in this century to have understood the difference between the kinship-system (as defined below, n. Io) and the inheritance-rules of a particular society: see, for example, The Growth of the Manor, pp. 9-13 and esp. notes 7 and II, where Maitland's failure to appreciate the difference is noted. But, as we shall see, he was probably wrong in supposing that the kinship-system of the Anglo-Saxons was an agnatic one. 2 Significantly perhaps, this is truer of the contributions to the Studies that deal with English themes than of the three that have a non-English subject. And Vinogradoff's own remarkable (and incomplete) Outlines of Historical Jurisprudence belong, of course, to the very last years of his life.</page><page sequence="2">usefully treated in this way is minimal. German medievalists, however, have reacted rather differently. Concerned to establish the existence in early German political and social life of a group or groups whose rights and powers did not come to them by devolution from the monarch, they have argued that the part played by a limited number of men, families or kindreds (Sippen) in the recorded history of Frankish and post-Frankish Germany and their discoverable relationships demonstrate the existence of a small upper stratum which collectively had such rights and maintained them through many generations. The notion of a uniquely-privileged "noble" stratum or class, characterized by what sociologists would recognize as their endogamy, commensalism and receipt of deference as well as by their dominating place in the political life of the society of which they formed part, has apparently been strengthened by the independent study of another segment of that society. Proceeding from quite different premises, a number of German medievalists have in recent decades sought to diminish the inherent rights of the "non-noble free", even to the extent of arguing that their legal libertas, with all the consequences that followed from it, was derived exclusively from and conditional on the monarch's discretionary authority, that is, they were all (in the extreme version of this theory) Kinigsfreie, "king's free".3 It has been left to Swiss scholars to recognize the paradox of a scheme which attributes inherent rights to a few by denying them to the many, and one of them has not hesitated to accuse the new generation of German early medieval historians of putting forward the Fiihrer- prinzip in a new guise!4 In two studies now in the press, I have commented on and criticized 3 "Noble" stratum: for a partial review and critique of the voluminous and complex literature see K. Leyser, "The German Aristocracy from the Ninth to the Early Twelfth Century", Past and Present, no. 41 (Dec.

PAST AND PRESENT 4 NUMBER 45</page><page sequence="3">EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIAL GROUPINGS certain aspects of these now inseparable approaches to the problems of early Germanic social stratification and organization;5 but in general the voluminous literature which they have provoked has not attracted the attention in this country which the subject deserves. Mr. Leyser's article in Past and Present, no. 41 (December, I968) is therefore doubly valuable as a critical introduction to recent literature on the German upper stratum or "nobility" and an independent contribution to the study of its status-features; and he rightly suggests that a similar approach might prove fruitful for the study of pre-io66 England. If such an attempt is ever made, in spite of the serious limitations of the English sources and the reluctance of many scholars to consider alternative approaches to Anglo-Saxon history,6 it is likely that its starting-point will be Mr. Leyser's remarks rather than the writings of the German scholars whose views he has partly accepted and partly modified. It is therefore unfortunate that in a central section of his illuminating article, Mr. Leyser's arguments rest on what is surely a misunderstanding of both the contemporary and the modern terminology of kinship. In his view, "an important example used to demonstrate the possible superiority of cognatio (maternal kin) over agnatio (paternal kin) is the way in which the Carolingian house-historians spoke of Hildegard, Charlemagne's second wife and the mother of Louis the Pious": that is to say, they recalled her ancestry through her Swabian mother. Subsequently Mr. Leyser remarks that: "The term cognatio was not uniformly used by early medieval writers or even by the scribes of charters to mean kinship on the mother's side. Often it stood for relationship generally as in classical literature". He proceeds to illustrate this from the case of the early eleventh-century Rhineland abbess who declared herself to be the last of her cognatio who could rule the convent as had been prescribed by her paternal grandfather when he founded it in 952. "Here then", he concludes, "cognatio actually meant agnatio, descent from a male ancestor. Hildegundis was by no means kinless but her female affinity did not meet the conditions of the 952 settlement".7 Several of these statements are misleading and one or two are clearly wrong. 5 "Europae pater: Charlemagne and his achievement in the light of recent scholarship", Eng.

Agnati were those who, by reason of birth, were under the - originally absolute - paternal authority (patria potestas) of a free-born citizen; or else, in some contexts, the nearest male relatives other than a man's own children. Agnatio referred exclusively to this relationship, the "agnatic tie" - a bond of dependence which ended for sons (and for any children they had in their father's lifetime) only with the death of their father; for daughters it ended when they contracted a lawful marriage and there- fore entered the agnatio of another man. Already in the late Republic, however, a married daughter was no longer assumed to have severed all formal connection with the family into which she had been born and might even continue to enjoy certain rights as an agnate of that family; and the legal notion of agnatus had correspondingly to be modified.8 Cognatio in Classical Latin refers to a blood-relationship not embraced by agnatio; cognati (-ae) are anyone in this relationship - brothers and sisters of the deceased father of a paterfamilias, his nephews and nieces, cousins, etc. whether on the mother's or the father's side. These two words are very common in literature but figure in juristic texts much less frequently than agnatio, agnatus because no important legal consequences, whether in the form of obligations or advantages, originally followed from a merely con- sanguineal relationship. To refer to the earlier generations in the male line from which a paterfamilias descended (that is, his patrilineal ancestors) other terms were used. Relations by marriage, our "in-laws", were adfines, the relationship thus created being adfinitas.9 The distinctions between agnatio-agnatus, cognatio-cognatus and adfinitas-adfinis are well illustrated by three passages from the Roman jurists of the second and third centuries and two from Isidore: for as is usually the case, this seventh-century scholar's terminology and definitions are taken predominantly from much older written sources, although they are not entirely unaffected by the Latin usage of his own time. 8 J. A. Crook, Law and Life of Rome (London, I967), ch. 4 is an admirable introduction to the Roman law of the family in its social context; the article agnatio (by T. Mayer-Maly) in Der Kleine Pauly, i (Stuttgart, I964), cc. I33-4, is the best brief account of its subject. For a fuller collection of references to the sources, Thes. Linguae Latinae, i (entries "adgnatio", "adgnatus") is indispensable. 9 For cognatio, adfines, see Thes. Ling. Lat., iii, cc. I476 ff.; i, cc. I2I7 ff.

(v) Isidore, Etymologiae, ix. 6. i and 2 (ed. Lindsay, I91 ): agnati are so called because they are added to the family when sons [al. children] are otherwise lacking; ... cognati are so called because they are linked by the tie of blood relationship (agnati dicti eo, quod accedant pro natis, dum desunt filii; . . . cognati dicti, quia sunt et ipsi propinquitate cognationis coniuncti). When, in the mid-nineteenth century, Sir Henry Maine contrasted the social or legal systems under which property descended exclusively in the male line with those in which it descended to or through persons of either sex, whether children or other relatives, he labelled these systems respectively agnatic and cognatic. Social anthropol- ogists who took their cue from Maine but were more interested in kinship-systems and their wider social implications found it convenient to use the words agnates and cognates of "descendants in the male line" and "descendants of either sex from a common father and mother"; and they added the words affines to indicate those related by marriage, not by blood.'0 In modern anthropology or sociology, therefore, the terms agnate and agnatic (usually of a lineage, but also of a kinship-system in which patrilineages play a predominant role) are not precisely equivalent to the Classical Latin words from which they are derived since they indicate membership of a lineage which may be - to use another "term of art" - of any depth and not related to a living person. On the other hand, cognatic and cognates as here defined are somewhat narrower in scope than the corresponding 10 L.

According to Radcliffe-Brown, p. 52: "In any given society a certain number of... relationships by blood or marriage are recognised for social purposes, i.e. they have attached to them certain rights or duties, or certain distinctive modes of behaviour. It is the relations that are recognised in this way that constitute what I am calling a kinship system, or, in full, a system of kinship and affinity". Compare further the illuminating book of J. K. Campbell cited below, n. 24. 7</page><page sequence="6">PAST AND PRESENT words in Latin: but they are never restricted to maternal kin or relationship through the mother. Sometimes, indeed, the notion of cognate is extended to include blood-relations of an earlier generation; such a usage has certain disadvantages, however, and many social anthropologists favour the term consanguine if one word has to be found to cover these relations as well as descendants.1l Writers before Maine had used the words agnate and cognate in somewhat different senses because they were in fact the heirs to post-Classical Latin usage. From at least the early second century the notion of the absolute authority of the paterfamilias had been under attack from various directions: the property rights of sons in their father's lifetime and of wives and daughters, whether in terms of inheritance or of partial freedom of disposal, steadily increased in the early Imperial centuries; and by the fourth century the legal significance of the agnatic tie had greatly diminished.12 Agnatio occasionally occurs in more or less its traditional sense as late as the early sixth century: a letter written by Sidonius Apollinaris in the 47os refers to a man who "is taking steps to succeed by right of agnation (per agnationis praerogativam) to an unmarried cousin on his father's side who has died intestate - unless indeed he should be thwarted by some crafty influence"; and a quarter-century later a chapter of the Lex Romana Burgundionum includes the phrase "the son of a paternal uncle and a grandson in a male line of descent shall succeed by right of agnation" (filius patrui et nepos per virilem sexum agnationis iure veniens debet succedere).13 A claim to inherit from an intestate as his (in Classical terms) agnatus proximus would have been difficult to sustain in the fifth century; the context of the phrase quoted from the Burgundian Lex is in fact one of a whole series of derogations from the Classical norms of intestate succession, and if Sidonius's acquaintance did vindicate his claim it was presumably because he could satisfy the rules of current "Vulgar Roman law" - in his case, probably that stated in a later chapter of the same titulus of the Burgundian Lex. 4 11 This is the usage of, for example, Lorraine Lancaster, "Kinship in Anglo- Saxon society", Brit.Jl. of Sociology, ix (I958), pp. 230-50, 359-77. 12 Crook, Law and Life of Rome, pp. 107-II, II3-5, II9-22; E. Levy, "Vul- garization of Roman law in the early Middle Ages", Medievalia et Humanistica, i (I943), pp. 28-30 (with ample references). 13 Sidonius, Epistolae, v.I.3 (ed. Luetjohann, Mon. Germ.

Burg., x.9; cf. x.6-8 (ed. de Salis, pp. I34-5). A confusion and conflation of the "classical" and the "Vulgar Roman" rules of intestate succession, as well as other misconceptions, seem to lie behind the extraordinary statement of the late PNre Grosjean and Miss Deanesley that: "In Roman (cont. on p. 9) 8 NUMBER 45</page><page sequence="7">EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIAL GROUPINGS Already in Imperial decrees of the fourth century transmitted by the two Codices, however, agnatio is also used in a concrete sense - "family" or "progeny" generally, and even of the family of a slave! And that this latter, very un-Classical, usage was a widespread one in the legal language of the Late Empire is indicated by its recurrence in early medieval texts which are strongly impregnated by "Vulgar law" terminology and notions, such as the seventh-century Lex Visigothorum and some of the eighth-century Frankish formulae.15 Already in the fifth century the author(s) of the interpretatio Pauli were led to conclude from the texts they were expounding and regularly mis- understanding that "agnates are those who descend through the male line, cognates through the female" (agnati sunt qui per virilem sexum descendunt, cognati autem per femineum) - a definition that was subsequently incorporated in the Lex Romana Burgundionum and linked with the unobjectionable statement: "because if a line of descent passes through a woman, cognatio takes the place of agnatio which has come to an end" (quia si in propinquitate intervenerit femina, soluta agnatione fit cognatio).16 I know of nothing to suggest that this particular "agnate/cognate" contrast became established usage in any part of Western Europe in the early Middle Ages; but in any case relations through a daughter or a sister are not "maternal kin". Most confusingly, in the late Classical and post-Classical centuries the words cognatus, cognata had acquired other specialized meanings, becoming the standard words for "brother-in-law", "sister-in-law", and exceptionally being used for other "in-law" relationships also. (note 14 cont.) civil law, as known to all notaries, the principle of cognatio [sic] was involved in cases of claims to inherit by heirs in a collateral line, not in cases of marriage. Collaterals might inherit, in the absence of direct heirs, up to the seventh degree of propinquity: after that the state stepped in and took the inheritance because cognatio extended no further" - although admittedly passages in the early Germanic codes which continue the concepts of "Vulgar Roman law" encourage such confusion: M. Deanesley and P. Grosjean, "The Canterbury edition of the answers of Pope Gregory I to St. Augustine", Jl. of Eccles. Hist., x (I959), P. 5. 15 Codex Theodosianus, ii.25.I (ed. Mommsen, i/2, p.

The earliest examples of cognatus, -a in their changed sense are of the later fourth century, but some of the many inscriptions which show this usage may well be older; and supporting evidence for the notion that it was a well-established feature of spoken (Vulgar) Latin well before this time would be - in the view of some scholars at least - that its derivatives are found in almost all Romance languages including Rumanian (cumnat, corresponding to Italian cognato, etc.).17 The history of the words with which we are primarily concerned in the period from the early sixth to the mid-ninth century is in some respects straightforward, in others complex and confused. Late Latin usage continued, particularly in laws and documents, but at least from the time of Bede a small number of writers and scholars were becoming acquainted with earlier - literary - usage; the societies to which this inherited terminology was applied were, however, very different from that for which it had first been coined. Agnatio in an abstract sense is virtually unknown but it does occur in a part of the Annales Mettenses which, although dated 688, was written a year or two after 80o, where it clearly means "descent in the male line". In documents, agnatio or its variant form agnitio (which is found in Frankish formulae as well as in charters from St. Gall and north Italy and is not to be attributed to the influence of Hibernian Latin) invariably has a concrete sense, that of progeny or descendants generally: just how far this could diverge from the usage of both Classical jurists and modern anthropologists is shown by a Milan document of 822 which is concerned with the unfree status of a certain Luba (fem.!) una cum agnitione suas (sic). The substantive agnatus has been noticed in this period only in the conservatively 17 Thes. Ling. Lat., cc. I48I-2 (entries "cognatus" subst. b; "cognata" subst. b); W. Meyer-Liibke, Romanisches Etymologisches Wirterbuch, 3rd edn. (Heidelberg, 1935), no. 2029. The previously-quoted passage from the jurist Modestinus suggests one way in which this semantic shift may have taken place. In later Roman and early medieval legal texts adfinis invariably means (adj.) "bordering, bordered by" or (subst.) "boundary, neighbour". The Classical usage "relation by marriage" was, however, obviously familiar in English missionary centres in later eighth-century Francia, since it is used in this sense by both Willibald and Hugeberc: see the passages quoted below, n. 2I. Compare the revival in Arbeo, Vita Haimhrammi, c. I4 (ed. Krusch, Scr. rer. Germ., 1920, pp. 46-7), and thereafter frequently in texts from Germanic regions, of the exceptional gener, "husband of a sister", recorded previously only in Cornelius Nepos and Codex Justinianus. IO NUMBER 45</page><page sequence="9">EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIAL GROUPINGS "Vulgar Roman" Lex Raetica Curiensis.18 Cognatus, cognata, "in-law, relative by marriage", is standard usage: it occurs in every century of the early Middle Ages; it is found in ecclesiastical law, papal letters, secular law, chronicles. The glossing of cognata with the words "that is to say, a brother's wife or a wife's sister" (quod est uxorfratris aut soror uxoris) in an edict of the Lombard king Liutprand (an. 723) might suggest that the special significance of the term was still unfamiliar in the early eighth century, but such an interpretation would almost certainly be wrong. Since at least the sixth century churchmen had been trying to get the Christianized Germanic peoples, whose own traditional attitudes were under certain circum- stances often very different - among them the Burgundians, the Anglo-Saxons, and later the Lombards - to accept the incestuous nature of marriage or adultery with a sister-in-law; and in the process of adding the sanctions of secular law to the Church's most recent decrees on this subject, Liutprand wishes to make it quite clear that (as in canon law) it is irrelevant how the "in-law" relationship has been created.19 The three chapters of the Edict of 723 which treat of "unlawful marriage" are a direct reflection of the decrees of the Roman synod of 721, whether or not those who drafted them were familiar - as is certainly possible - with some version of the recently much-discussed Responsiones Gregorii ad Augustinum. Chapter 8 of the 721 acta reiterates earlier condemnation of marriage between cousins (consobrini). Chapter 9 declares that "If anyone shall have taken a wife from his own cognatio or whose cognatus [that is affine, in-law] 18 Annales Mettenses priores, ed. B. von Simson (Scr. rer.

There is no doubt that (particularly in literary texts) it may mean "relationship", "kinship" in the abstract; but when it is used in decrees and laws of early medieval date it very frequently corresponds (as here) to our "kin-group, kindred", and in documents almost always does so. Genealogia, consanguinitas and one or two other words are occasionally used in the same sense. The persons who collectively form this kin-group are usually referred to as propinqui or parentes but sometimes, confusingly if significantly, as amici - because in a "traditional" society the only true friends a man can have are those linked to him by ties of blood.21 Who precisely these kinsfolk were, what the nature and extent of the cognatio was, are not problems that can be decided linguistically; still less can they be 20 Leges Liutpr., xxxii-xxxiv (an.

Eccles., liv (I959), PP. 879-94 (with its severe but entirely justified criticisms of the Deanesley-Grosjean article cited above, n.

If this is confirmed, the Lombard "capital", where clergy sent from Rome were completing the work of conversion in the concluding decades of that century, would be the obvious context. 21 Not certainly either abstract or concrete are the usages in Edictus Rothari, cliii (ed. Beyerle, p. 48): de gradibus cognationum (because of the plural); and Bede, Hist. Eccles., ii.9 (ed. Plummer, i, p. 97) (because of the context).

NUMBER 45 12</page><page sequence="11">EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIAL GROUPINGS solved by transferring the legal rules or conventions of one society (such as that of Republican and Imperial Rome) to others in which the functions of the kindred, and the social structure of which these were one aspect, were very different. This is strikingly illustrated by the evidence from Ireland, the one part of early medieval Europe in which the kinship-system was for all practical purposes agnatic, as in Classical Rome. The evidence of the vernacular Irish law-texts is fortunately very specific on this point: Originally the narrowest of the kin-groups recognized by the law was the four-generations group, called in Irish the derbfhine, the agnatic descendants of a common great-grandfather, in other words all persons related to each other in the male line up to and including second cousins.... But there were two other wider kin-groups, which stood as it were in reserve for special circumstances, and in these circumstances a man might share in the liabilities and sometimes inherit the property of his third or fourth cousin.22 Yet when early Irish Latin writers had to find a translation for fine, that is, both the narrow and the wider kin-groups, the word they used was cognitio: Adomnan in his Vita Columbae (together with cognitionalis homo for "kinsman"), for example, and in an extremely interesting section of the probably early eighth-century Collectio canonum Hibernensis.23 The kinship-systems of late Republican and early Imperial Rome and of early medieval Ireland were, therefore, in the terminology of anthropologists and sociologists, both unilineal (and patrilineal). The purpose or social functions of kinship, the duties and rights of kindred, were however very different in the two societies - not least in the inevitable importance in Ireland of mutual self-help and protection, vendetta and settlement by composition, for which the kin-group had collective responsibilities. The law-codes of all the Germanic peoples who had established themselves in the Roman Empire between the late fourth and late sixth century assume or lay down similar responsibilities for their kin-groups. But among these peoples - although the evidence for some of them is less full than one would wish - it is clear that kinship was non-unilineal or bilateral: 22 D. A. Binchy, "Secular Institutions", in Early Irish Society, ed. M. Dillon (Dublin, 1954, 1963), p. 58.

Miss Lorraine Lancaster has argued forcibly that the absence of distinctive terms for second, third, fourth cousins, etc. makes it unlikely that there were any clear rules about the set of kin responsible for the payment of wergild in Anglo-Saxon England - which may well be true. The view of Miss Phillpotts and Miss Lancaster that in practice the responsibility of kinsmen might not extend beyond a very narrow circle of kinsmen, perhaps only the immediate family, is borne out by one of the rare accounts of a non- magnate feud - just post-Io66 - in the Life of Wulfstan of Worcester: here it is a man's five brothers who insist on blood-revenge for his accidental killing, although it is not absolutely certain (however 24 For the terminology see Mair, Introduction to Social Anthropology, pp. 64-7; Lancaster, "Kinship in Anglo-Saxon society" (cited above, n. II), pp. 230-2. An excellent account of the extent and functioning of a bilateral kinship-system in a "traditional" European society is J. K. Campbell, Honour, Family and Patronage (Oxford, I964), esp. chaps. 3, 5, 6. 25 Lancaster, art. cit., is indeed the only detailed and rigorous sociological analysis of the evidence of texts since B. S. Phillpotts, Kindred and Clan in the Middle Ages and after (Cambridge, I9I3) which is still valuable but suffers from lack of chronological precision. K. F. Drew, "The Germanic family of the Leges Burgundionum", Medievalia et Humanistica, xv (I963), pp. 5-14 is almost exclusively concerned with mundium. E. A. Thompson, "The barbarian kingdoms in Gaul and Spain", Nottingham Medieval Studies, vii (I963), pp. II- 20 in my view misunderstands the functions of kinship and consequently seriously underestimates its importance in the Romano-Germanic kingdoms. For vendetta see M. Gluckman, "The peace in the feud", Custom and Conflict in Africa (1956), ch. I, repr. from Past and Present, no. 8 (Nov. I955), pp. I-I4; J. M. Wallace-Hadrill, "The bloodfeud of the Franks", The Long-haired Kings (London, I962), ch. 6. PAST AND PRESENT I4 NUMBER 45</page><page sequence="13">EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIAL GROUPINGS likely) that they are coterminous with the cognati who have refused to accept monetary compensation.26 There is no good reason for thinking that the situation was any different on the Continent. It is clear that neither the reckoning as far as "the seventh generation" for purposes of property inheritance - transmitted via "Vulgar Roman law" texts from the very different conditions of Classical Rome - nor the ordering of a set of kin according to the parts of the body, based on the supposed metaphoric force of the standard word for "(degree of) relationship", namely geniculum (corresponding to Old English cneow, etc.) have any socio- logical reality.27 The likelihood is that the circle of kinsmen - cognatio, consanguinitas or genealogia, propinqui or parentes - was differently conceived not only among different Germanic peoples but locally according to custom and differently when the issue was one of inheritance of land or a monastery, vendetta and composition or who should be present at a wedding-feast. The only consistent feature is the bilateral nature of the kin-set and the fact, therefore, that such a set can have no structural persistence through several generations. 28 Lancaster, art. cit., pp. 232-4, emphasizing that there is no support in the texts for Radcliffe-Brown's view that the Anglo-Saxon kin-group embraced sixth cousins (or, as he asserts elsewhere, that the sharing of the wergild of a kinsman extended to fifth cousins); Phillpotts, Kindred and Clan, pp. 217-8; William of Malmesbury, Vita Wulfstani, xv (ed. Darlington, p. 38). For "(settlement by) composition", William of Malmesbury uses the standard Continental technical term amicitia; the corresponding word in the lost Old English Life which he was translating was presumably lufu, although it is not recorded in this sense (as my colleague Professor K. Cameron has kindly confirmed): lufu in Ethelred, iii.I3, which is rendered by amicitia in the corre- sponding passage of the Quadripartitus, must mean - as the context shows - "agreement to arbitration (involving a third party)", (not "compromise" as in Medieval Latin Word-List, s.v.), which is not quite the same as a settlement reached by bilateral negotiation. 27 So, rightly, Phillpotts, Kindred and Clan, p. 216, n. 2; Lancaster, "Kinship in Anglo-Saxon society", p. 233. The anthropomorphic analogy is a late development, perhaps not earlier than the early eleventh century. Geniculum, first recorded in Pactus legis Salicae, xliv.II-I2 (ed. Eckhardt, Mon. Germ. Hist., I.iv/I, I962, pp. 172-3), then in Lex Ribuaria, lvii.4 (ed. Beyerle and Buchner, p. IO5) and Ed. Rothari, cliii (ed. Beyerle, p. 48), means simply "relationship, degree of relationship", as presumably the common Germanic word or cognate Germanic-language words (as Old English cneow) of which it is a translation: etymology must not be confused with synchronic semantics, as James Barr, The Semantics of Biblical Language (Oxford, 196I), esp. pp. 37-40, 107-I8, has sharply reminded us. The unreality of a kin-set extending to "the seventh generation" is emphasized by the insistence of Ed. Roth., cliii that anyone who wishes to succeed (to the property of a kinsman) must be able to name each of the ancestors (antecessorum suorum) on descent from whom his claim is based. Paul the Deacon, writing c. 790, claimed to know the names of his paternal grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather, although since he asserted that the latter came to Italy in 568 it is more than likely that the family tradition had already been in some way falsified: see Historia Langobardorum, iv.37 ex. I5</page><page sequence="14">PAST AND PRESENT From the second quarter of the ninth century, however, there are signs that in Carolingian lands cognatio was undergoing a further change of meaning. A St. Gall document of 827 created a precaria for the life of the donor of the property in the first instance: "and if his sons Paldcoz and Perahtolf shall outlive him, they shall be on the same terms (similiter faciant ipsi) and [likewise] all their cognatio". It is pretty clear from the context that cognatio here does not refer to kindred including cousins, etc.; it is not impossible that it means "agnates, agnatic descendants", but the emphasis is certainly on descendants in the direct line - when they fail, the land reverts to the monastery. It is equally clearly so in the passage in Thegan which was one of the starting-points of this inquiry: Hildigarda erat de cognatione Gotefridi ducis Alamannorum, through three generations in the male line and a fourth in the female. And the point of abbess Hildegundis's statement in IoI4 is precisely that she was the last female who could trace descent from the founder (as distinct from collateral relatives) - as Mr. Leyser correctly recognizes, although he then confuses the issue by saying that here "cognatio actually meant agnatio, descent from a male ancestor", not "descent in general".28 Something more may be involved here than a further change of meaning (or semantic shift) in the technical terminology of what was now a "learned" language. It is right to be sceptical of the view that the notions of social grouping which seem to be implied by the various collective entries in the Libri Memoriales of religious com- munities necessarily correspond to the groupings and relationships recognized by the persons named in other social activities. The changes which take place in the character of such entries in the course of the ninth century are, however, more fundamental than the exclusion or inclusion of, say, third cousins in a kin-set. For a time laymen appear in these "Books of Remembrance" in entries based on rank or office. In the middle years of the ninth century the St. Gall Liber temporarily has separate entries for (lay) men and women. In the later ninth century in all the Libri the characteristic entry is a "family" or "kin" one; and although the range of relationships covered by these entries may vary widely, there does seem to be a predominance of ones which embrace a husband and wife, their 28 Urk.-buch St. Gallen, i, no. 306; Thegan, Vita Hludowici, ii (Mon. Germ. Hist., Scr., ii, pp. 590-I); Leyser, art. cit., p. 35, with p. 5 above. The signifi- cance of cognatio here is in fact identical with that of the papal letter of 748 cited above, n. 21. But cognatio for "direct line of descent" is perhaps already to be found in a papal letter of c. 625; Bede, Hist. Eccles., ii.Io (ed. Plummer, i, p. 103). I6 NUMBER 45</page><page sequence="15">EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIAL GROUPINGS agnates and their affines.29 In other words, the class of substantial landowners is tending to emphasize agnatic kin at the expense of cognatic. Such a development may, indeed, have been taking place even earlier in particular contexts: Vinogradoff suggested nearly seventy years ago that the privileged position accorded to five named genealogiae in a much-discussed chapter of the eighth-century Lex Baiuvariorum must imply the exclusive recognition of agnatic relationships in these kindreds as well as in that of the Agilolfing dukes.3 0 The political and social conditions of the end of the ninth and the tenth centuries seem to have put a brake on the extension of the principle of agnaticism among landowning families and may indeed temporarily have reversed the process. Its revival is one aspect of the growing "self-consciousness" of the upper strata of society in post-Carolingian Europe and the emergence of new social attitudes which reinforce their separateness from other strata. To the small landowner, whether "gentry" or peasant, what mattered still was that there should be kinsfolk able to offer support on occasions of crisis - violent death, disputes over property, the consequences of mis- fortune. To magnates what mattered increasingly was the unchallenged possession of lands and office, and the secure social superiority and power at both local and "national" level that went with them: in this context the important relationships were those of descendance or "lineage", and cousinly relationships were more often a source of tension and dissension than the reverse.31 The serious study of social stratification and its concomitants in the early Middle Ages is new and will be regarded by some historians as another unnecessary concession to "trendiness"; but it is - or 29 K.

Even if we accept the views of those who believe that the Lex in its present form contains elements that are as much as a century older (Buchner, Die Rechtsquellen, pp. 26-9), tit. iii - like tit. ii - clearly reflects the conditions of early eighth-century Bavaria: so, after others, B. Krusch, Neue Forschungen iuber die drei Oberdeutschen Leges (Abhandl. Gottingen; 1927), esp. pp. 94-5; cf. Thompson, Nott. Med. Studies, vii, p. I2. Some scholars, however, would still argue that the named genealogiae, like that of the Agilolfings themselves, had a recognizable existence already in the sixth century: see F. Prinz, "Herzog u. Adel im agilolfingischen Bayern", Wegeder Forschung, lx (I965), pp. 225-63. 31 For the establishment of "lineages" in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries see L. Genicot, "La noblesse au Moyen Age dans l'ancienne 'Francie' ", Annales, xvii (I962), esp. pp. 13-21; Leyser, art. cit., pp. 48-53, and the other literature cited by these writers.

This is only one of a number of fields in which the professed historian is unlikely to find relevant questions and meaningful answers without a knowledge of the concepts and terminology of other disciplines, "new" and not-so-new. His texts and other sources and their exposition remain, however, the historian's primary objects of study and specific task. For a medievalist this will always involve the collation and interpretation, with strict reference to context, of the Latin terminology of the period. It does not matter whether this activity is called lexicography (felt to be old-fashioned and even pedantic) or historical semantics (thought to be forward-looking and exciting). What does matter is that in those few aspects of medieval history where precision is possible we should be precise. University of Nottingham D. A.
