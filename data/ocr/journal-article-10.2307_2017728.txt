<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XXXIX, No. 24 NOVEMBER 19, 1942 THE JOuRNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ARE IDEAS PHYSICAL? IN his celebrated essay "The Energies of Men," William James asks us to believe that ideas release energy, that they are dynamo- genic agents. This is particularly true, he says, of personal ideals or socially significant principles. One thinks of the slogan "Re- member Pearl Harbor" or the democratic principle: all men are created equal. It seems indisputable that in some sense ideas, fertile or vicious, have influenced the course of human history. Now if ideas do release energy, individually or collectively, is it not clear that they must possess energy? And if they release physical energy in the human organism, must they not be physical forces? An affirmative answer to these questions is implied by, although not always explicit in, the contemporary doctrine of the physical mind. This hypothesis has been clearly expressed in the impressive statement: "Point for point, the properties of the mind turn out to be identical with known properties of the brain."' A modified version of this view is to the effect that ideas are aspects of physical forces. This is closer to the naturalistic conceptions of S. Alexander and R. W. Sellars who repudiate epiphenomenalism but regard consciousness as a quality or aspect of organized brain- processes. Both views agree that ideas regulate or re-enforce be- havior to the extent that they are, wholly or in part, energy- patterns in the human cerebrum. The doctrine of the physical mind is not subject to the glaring difficulties of radical behaviorism, for it entails full recognition of the reality of introspective data and its advocates freely concede that these "conscious processes" cast much light upon the brain- process. On the other hand, it carries with it a clear denial of psycho-physical dualism and an affirmation that all the energy dis- played by human beings is physical energy of one form or another. In these latter respects, the doctrine in question is fundamentally opposed to dualistic conceptions of "mind energy" such as those of Bergson, McDougall, and many of the psycho-analysts. In the judgment of these thinkers, mind is a distinct kind of energy, not describable or measurable in terms of the categories and units of 1 P. T. Young, Motivation of Behavior, p. 532. 645</page><page sequence="2">646 THE JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY the physical sciences. Hence ideas, if they are forces, are non- physical forces. As against this view, the doctrine of the physical mind implies that ideas are "energy traces" in the brain which, under certain conditions of re-facilitation, in some way affect the course of nervous energy on its way to the muscles and glands. Such traces may be viewed either as persisting stresses at the sy- napses or as well-established associative pathways formed by condi- tioning or in some comparable manner. Professor Montague's highly original theory of consciousness as potential energy or "an- ergy" in the brain appears to be a compromise between these con- trasting views but to lean more closely to the Bergsonian doctrine both in its radical conception of time and in being favorable to belief in personal immortality.2 Another advantage of the doctrine of the physical mind is that it can be stated in such a way as not to violate the law of conserva- tion of energy as does its older version, epiphenomenalism. The latter, in teaching that consciousness is only an aura surrounding the human machine, like a rainbow over a waterfall or the babbling of a brook,8 does involve this difficulty that it asks us to believe in a non-causative effect, an efilorescence of the expenditure of energy which gives back no energy and transmits none. The analogies of the epiphenomenalist were, indeed, never very convine- ing. For the rainbow over the waterfall or the babbling of a brook may inspire the creative efforts of the poet or the theologian. Even the evanescent shadow that follows a man in the sunlight may startle an animal or arouse the risibility of a child. The epiphe- nomenalist may escape this by becoming a parallelist. But by thus asserting that no brain energy goes into the making of ideas he accepts the perpetual miracle of emergent qualities without a cause. Now the doctrine of the physical mind, in common with most forms of naturalism, is not free from this haunting difficulty. But, by placing ideas within the stream of pulsing energy that surges across the brain and not outside of it, the physicalist con- trives to affirm that our ideas are naturally eaused like breathing or any other function and that they participate in the energizing of human behavior. This, I think, is the strength of Professor Sellars' evolutionary naturalism. It naturalizes consciousness without making it otiose or merely luxurious. Mind becomes a qualitied aspect of a total process of mind-brain, the brain part of which would function differently and less effectively if it were not glowing with consciousnes 2 W. P.

Santayana, The Bealm of Essence, p. 134.</page><page sequence="3">ARE IDEAS PHYSICAL? 647 Before we can rest in such an enticing view, however, two very fundamental questions must be asked. If ideas are basically physi- cal, do they possess physical properties? And do their properties include dynamic or causal, as well as purely qualitative properties ? William James, when he wrote "The Energies of Men," was dual- istic enough to say "no" to the first question and "yes" to the second and thus to approach rather closely to Bergson's doctrine of mind energy. His argument is worth considering afresh. He points out that as human beings we can energize not only on pro- gressively more active levels but also on qualitatively higher levels. "Everyone," he remarks, "feels that his total power rises when he passes to a higher qualitative level of life." Thus, he goes on to say in a memorable passage, "writing is higher than walking, thinking is higher than writing, deciding higher than thinking, deciding 'no' higher than deciding 'yes.' " The higher we go in this scale of living, the more inner work is necessary. But the total expenditure of calories by the organism may be less. Some- times this inner work is inversely proportional to the number of foot-pounds of energy expended. Just to relax and to achieve inner peace or harmony may be the essence of spiritual work. The quiet acceptance of a unifying principle of life is much more truly efficacious than so much muscular strain that depletes our reserves. The essential basis of this argument for mind energy, then, is that we have direct evidence of mental or spiritual work as opposed to merely physical work and that since energy is usually defined as work done or the capacity for work it is entirely logical to postulate the existence of mental or spiritual energy. Just as physical work represents the application of so much force against so much resist- ance, as in overcoming gravitation, so mental work involves the putting forth of mental force (intelligent effort) against mental resistance (problems, difficulties, mental inertia). Is it not true, and here we advance beyond James, that the psychologist succeeds in measuring this mental energy with some degree of exactnesst He does not measure it in physical units, or even in I. Q. points as we sometimes suppose, but basically in terms of questions of graded difficulty. The typical intelligence test is constructed upon the principle of mental gradients. Each successive question re- quires, not more muscular effort or more visceral effort which are, indeed, a handicap at times, but more work in the sense of attentive clarification or analysis and relation-grasping or pattern-forming synthesis. As yet no instrument for measuring moral or spiritual work has been devised. The nearest approach to this is the scale of values type of test which is now quite familiar. Such a test gives a rough measure of the relative amount of interest (affeetive</page><page sequence="4">648 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY energy) which esthetic, religious, social, and other stimuli-complexes elicit from you. But the choices do not appear to be graded in terms of valuational difficulty and hence to measure valuational energy. The phenomenological truth of James's descriptions of mental and spiritual levels of work can not very well be denied by the proponent of the doctrine of the physical mind. He is, therefore, forced to argue that such apparent mental or spiritual energy is really nervous energy with certain qualities of sensory pain or pleasure and of imagery supervening. He endeavors to explain all this in terms of the integrative activity of the human nervous sys- tem. A higher level of personal activity must represent: (1) higher levels in the nervous system; (2) more complex unities of inter-neural functioning; (3) greater approximation to the inte- grative activity of the brain as a whole as opposed to localized functions of specific tracts; (4) more refined sensory or imaginal pleasure or a more satisfying re-organization of the perceptual field through the working of the brain as a whole. Man is a time- binding and space-binding animal to the extent that sweeping waves of nervous energy embrace in certain unities, admittedly difficult to explore, spatially discrete brain-processes from different sensory points and memories (brain-traces) of differing degrees of intensity from recent to remote. The genius differs from the ordi- naty person, according to this view, not in the size of his brain but in: (a) some as yet unknown superior quality of his brain cells; and (b) in the superior concentration of energy or exaltation of motive which spurs him to use the widest neural inter-connections of his brain to a much greater degree than his less talented fellows. The creation of art, science, literature, morality, and religion must be understood in these terms. Advocates of the mind-energy view may criticize this theory either from a negative or from a positive point of view. The former and less effective argument, like that of the neo-vitalist, points us to the immensity of our ignorance of the brain and its levels. The superior quality of highly integrated brain tissue seems to be read into it by projection rather than discovered by authentic neurological findings. Neurologists admit that the brain of the genius does not differ in quality of tissue from that of the normal brain. It is only the sub-normal brain that is defective in certain layers. The electro-chemical activity of one nerve-cell is very much like that of any other. The conception of a general fund of central nervous energy which sweeps across the brain and unites the different areas in other than a sympathetic resonance seems to be more speculative than founded upon fact. The so-</page><page sequence="5">ARE IDEAS PHYSICAL? 649 called brain-waves have been sorted out into different types such as alpha, beta, gamma, etc., but they have not been definitely graded as to quality. All "alpha waves" look very much alike on the record. No type of brain-wave yet discovered represents what may properly be called creative thinking. The leading neurolo- gists admit that they do not yet know any details of the process whereby the brain conserves memories. Even the qualities of sen- sation which introspeetion reports are not yet explained in terms of specific nerve-energies or known cortical patterns. Even so simple an attribute of consciousness as intensity is only correlated with frequency of nerve-impulse, not clearly understood in terms of it. Nerve-fusion as a mode of explanation of the phenomenally indubitable sensory fusion is a very difficult conception. Small wonder that the eminent neurologist, E. D. Adrian, wrote some time ago: "The nervous system . . . is a material system somehow responsible for such nonmaterial things as emotions and thoughts. These are in the category outside the range of mechanical explana- tion, and for this reason will never be fully explainable in terms of physics and chemistry."' The weakness of these objections, well-grounded as they may be, lies in the fact that they minimize the progress that has been made and will be made in neurological and bio-chemical discovery. Who knows but that the answers to these enigmas will be forthcoming within the next century. The mind-energist is on much stronger ground when he contends, much in the spirit of William James, that we are making faster progress in understanding the human mind by assuming that, once mentality emerges in the long course of cosmic evolution, it presents us with certain new qualities, properties, and laws which, although superimposed upon those of physics and physiological chemistry, are in some sense distinctive, unique, or autonomous. Even the successors of behaviorism, the so-called objectivists, now freely concede that psychology as a science has its own categories and its own distinctive methods of procedure, even its own factual content, and is not to be regarded as an appendage of either biology or bio-chemistry. They would agree that much more is being learned about the 'nature of per- sonality from personality tests, clinical procedure, and from stud' ies of phenomenal behavior than from physical investigations of our human substrate. In this' connection it is significant to note that one of the most authoritative and illuminating works on per- sonality to appear in recent years is a six-hundred-page volume in which only a few paragraphs are devoted to neurological findings.' 4 G. W. Allport, Per8onalityy.</page><page sequence="6">650 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Mathematical procedures and depth analyses applied to what may be called "human data" appear to be the chief growing points of the science of the mind at present. The theory of mind-energy, however, has a more metaphysical approach in its confrontation of the doctrine of the physical mind. A philosophy of mind can hardly escape being a philosophy of reality since man's mind emerges out of the cosmos. Included in any adequate view of the universe must be some provision for that aspect of ideas which we denominate under the head of univer- sals. It seems beyond question that man responds to general principles, to wide relationships, to universal or invariant connec- tions of the data of experience. He is no longer regarded as a mere rationalist, but is a thoroughgoing empiricist who recog- nizes this realm as not only real but operative. Now the physi- calist has his greatest difficulty at precisely this point, namely, as to what type of physical process can be the basis of general ideas, the laws of psychology, for example. An underlying physical identity of pattern will not suffice to explain many types of uni- versals which are, phenomenologically at least, not spatial or ma- terial but logical, temporal, or trans-temporal and -axiological. Bergson appears to be right when he affirms that the higher up we go in the scale of mentality the more the parallelism of the psychical and the physical breaks down. This is simply to affirm that logic, esthetics, ethics, politics, and history are autonomous sciences; they are not branches of physics; they are most fruitfully explored in terms of non-physical categories. The view that ideas are not only non-physical realities but actually operative forces, however, is less easy to establish and has a great weight of traditional criticism against it. Yet Bergson seems to be entirely sound when he declares that we have a primi- tive, unsophisticated perception of actual force or energy in our own experience of effort." This deserves to be respected and taken for its full worth rather than explained away or analyzed into static elements. Professor Montague's version of this, namely, that we do have an experience of enforcement and that our par- ticipatory awareness of the potential energy of stress is just as objectively valid as our visual perceptions, is no less plausible.6 It seems undeniable, moreover, that from Plato to Bergson most of the dualistic and idealistic systems have taken this primary causality as almost axiomatic. In some sense all philosophers are causally anthropomorphic to the extent of believing that their ideas are efficacious. Otherwise why should they be so busy try- 5 Time and Free WsAl, authorized trans., .paeeim. 6 The Way8 of Thing., p. 183, p. 498.</page><page sequence="7">ARE IDEAS PHYSICAL? 651 ing to install them in other philosophers' brains to replace ideas which they regard as illogical or outworn. The objections of the positivists, however, are sufficiently acute to merit respectful at- tention. First, there is the contention, so often repeated by psychologists, that the belief in the efficacy of ideas is a relic of primitive animism and illusory because pre-scientific. This is either a question-beg- ging epithet or it rests upon the rather naive view that scientific analysis and abstraction give an exhaustive account of whatever science investigates. A more impressive but none the less irrel- evant objection is to the effect that our sense of effort can not be trusted as veridical because it is not simple, as Bergson contends, but complex, that is, composed of certain muscular sensations and images. But this is true of all perceptual knowledge, notably of our vision of physical objects which, since the great realistic in- stauration of 1901, has seemed so much less subject to skepticism than formerly. In short, visual realism is the minimum of all realisms but kinesthetic realism is equally well-founded. Another answer is that an experience of fact or value may be at once com- plex and simple, at once subjective and objectively revealing. A third irrelevant objection, traceable to Hume but still parroted, is that our awareness of power or force does not enable us to pre- dict future occurrences or to derive a law of consequences; in short, that it does not solve the problem of induction. The answer is that this is true but that it is not a special difficulty of kinesthetic realism or dynamism. It is only a general difficulty of all tran- scendent inference from immediately given data. It demands so- lution, but not by giving it up as the positivist tends to do. It is best solved, in the writer's judgment, after the manner of White- head's philosophy of the organism or of some similar cosmic ideal- ism or energism, that is, by a general metaphysical solution. The remaining objections to'the postulate of dynamism, i.e., of idea-forces, are largely overcome, I think, by the following con- siderations: (1) The business of philosophy is not to do away with the major intuitions of the human race, of which the con- sciousness of mental efficacy is one, but to explicate them and to render them consistent. (2) The process of history is well-nigh unintelligible unless we assume that great ideas, as of democracy, individual rights, a super-race, or a divine destiny, have been actually operative along with natural forces such as climate and economic forces such as food-supply. But such history-shaping ideas, although not devoid of physical properties, are much more completely interpreted in terms of conscious experiences of value and power. (3) No complete or intelligible philosophy in the</page><page sequence="8">652 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY long run evades the. category of activity-passivity. The various forms of naturalism limit the sphere of this category to natural events or energies. But this limitation appears to be arbitrary, that is, founded upon a preference for the explanations of the nat- ural sciences rather than a reasoned justification of this prefer- ence. The positivist, speaking broadly, professes "to reject this category entirely but in the end smuggles it in, either in the cer- tainty of his own deductions or in his interpretation of strict im- plication. Even if he reduces such certainty to 'a probability, he nevertheless experiences some conviction of the logical ground of such probability. Even if 'he reduces strict implication to ana- lytical judgment or to a freely chosen postulate, it gives him"a sense,of mental power to do so. (4) As various writers such as James, Bergson, Broad, Pillsbury, Jennings, and Pratt, have argued, the application of the inductive causal methods to the antecedents of behavior in volition supports the view that the idea of the goal or the intention of the agent is, inferentially, at le'ast, a co-cause of that behavior, in the sense of being always present when voluntary action occurs, always absent when voluntary action fails to occur, and varying in degree, although in different units, concomitantly with the corresponding behavior. The well-known exceptions, stressed by Spinoza and Hume, can be adequately ex- plained in terms of the principle of composition of causes or of failure to achieve the normal conditions of volition.7 (5) -Attempts to explain the efficacy of volition in terms of past conditioning or unconscious learning involve the "retro-projective fallacy," that is, the preformationist assumption that the present is only an un- folding of past causes or energy-systems. In' particular, such at- tempts seem to ignore the fact that, back to birth at least, the or- ganism was consciously struggling to learn and consciously aware of success, even if success was accidental. (6) Man's indubitable creativity can be more intelligibly explained in terms of the func- tioning of ideas which are cross-fertilizations of his various con- served experiences evaluated in the focus of consciousness rather than by postulating unconscious creativities or as yet mythical trans-cortical fusions. Cerebral association should be viewed as the machinery of creation rather than its very essence. Many philosophers will still feel that the hypothesis of mind- energy-with its idea-forces is too dualistic and involves a mysteri- ous transeunt causation. The writer submits that this objection is at bottom a fallacy of spatialization or of reification. The true disjunction here is not between an identity of mind and brain that 7 Cf. the writer's article: "Personal Agency and the Humian Analysis," this JOURNAL, Vol. XXIV (1927), pp. 645-656.</page><page sequence="9">ARE IDEAS PHYSICAL? 653 ill accords with their manifest differences of properties...and an ultra-Cartesian dualism that would put mind outside the brain. When any two forms of energy in the universe interact or when one is converted into another, there is a region of mediation or over- lapping. There is qualitative discontinuity but functional con tinuity. What we feel in- volition or thought is not a qualitative identity of mind .and brain but a functional continuity made pos- sible by the fact- that the stream of consciousness has depth as well as surface shimmer. This dimension of consciousness is recognized not only in the Freudian fore-conscious but.in the orthodox psy- chological concept of the subconscious, conceived as marginal awareness. It has been metaphysically described with increasing acuteness by Leibniz, Schopenhauer, and Bergson. If, then, mind possesses depth (or "volume" as some psychologists prefer to call it), it becomes intelligible to conceive it as pervading the organism and hence being able to sense in a participative way both the up- rush of subconscious desire and the answering surge of telic will. Hume failed to discover the presence of "power,'' not only be- cause his psychology was atomistic instead of configurational, but because he looked only on the surfac.e of consciousness as it gleams in the spotlight of attentive clearness. Introspection has been-too exclusively identified with this clear, superficial awareness, too little with the deeper, more natural awareness of personal re- sourcefulness without which such basic terms as "capacity," "energy," and "force" would be meaningless to us. It is the merit of Freud, McDougall, and William Stern to have revived this fruitful conception of depth of consciousness and made it the basis of a truly dynamic science of mind. It is unlikely that the advocate of the physical mind theory will be convinced, From a naturalistic evolutionary view, ideas seem to have evolved too late in the history of the cosmos to be causally important. Is it not the superior brain of man that is really re- sponsible- for what little progress he has made? Are not the fundamental causes the mechanical, electrical, and chemical ener- gies which have been in the world beyond any knowable begin- ning? At this point the doctrine in question is seen as a corollary of cosmic naturalism. Naturalism has been well summarized by Professor Hocking as a philosophy which professes to be complete but which leaves many aspects of the world unexplained.8 Pro- fessor Boodin has, in essence, charged naturalism with being' a view of the universe without a creative principle.9 Many centuries ago Plato in the Phaedo anticipated these fundamental objections 8 Types of Philosophy, revised edition, pp. 94 ff. 9 Three Interpretations of the Universe, Ch. 11.</page><page sequence="10">654 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY by asking how we are to account for the coming into being of order in the world without a principle of order. Socrates concludes that the cause of his sitting there is not the ten thousand physical causes, although they play a part, but his "choice of the best." So in the world at large, the principle that "will never be over- thrown" is: "By beauty all things become beautiful." In this age refreshed by the speculative vision of Whitehead, the pervading and increasing order of the world seems no longer utterly insol- uble. Idealism, theism, and cosmic vitalism today would almost coincide in this inference: the evolving order of nature, life, and history implies certain principles of order; order implies an orderer. To this, naturalism opposes a cosmic epiphenomenalism. There is something in the human mind, historic prejudice, or deep reason, which makes this epigenesis of orders only slightly more convincing than a sterile preformationism. That ideas actually guide our organisms and that principles have guided the energies of nature are complementary aspects of a difficult but thoroughly tenable hypothesis. It is the common insight of Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz, Hegel, Bergson, and Whitehead, uniting their astonishing variety of metaphysical detail. Did six so seminal thinkers unite in an illusion ?
