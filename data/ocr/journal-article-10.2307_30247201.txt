Katsina-like masks and masked figures on ceramics are identified, described, and contrasted with other anthropomorphs. Mask depictions are shown to: 1) occur only after about A.D. 1300 in the Homol'ovi area, and only at the large, aggregated sites; 2) occur in various media, of which kiva murals and painted stone slabs probably had ritual functions; and 3) occur in many different contexts, including some with high visibility, suggesting that all community members had access to knowledge of the cult. Katsinas are benevolent spirit beings who reside in the mountains and springs part of the year, and come to the pueblos bringing rain to the dry fields. Wearing distinctive symbol-laden masks and costumes, they dance in the plazas and distri- bute food and gifts to community members and guests. Did katsinas come to Homol'ovi before the area was abandoned for the Hopi Mesas in the early A.D. 1400s? Was the katsina cult then, as now, an ideology inviting the participation of the entire community? The most convincing evidence for the katsina cult at Homol'ovi is found in the depictions of katsina-like masks and figures in visual media such as rock art, murals, and pottery. This study addresses these questions by focusing on ceramic designs that appear to depict katsinas, and several aspects of the contexts of the designs and the objects that bear them. Between about A.D. 1275 and 1300, potters of the Colorado Plateau and Upper Little Colorado River began to radically change the way they decorated their products. In addition to diversifying the range of colors and kinds of design structures used, potters depicted more life forms. They "broke away from the rigid constrictions of the earlier geometrics, and frets and scrolls sprouted wings and tails and became birds" (Carlson 1982:221). Carnivores with elegant claws and elaborate anthropomorphic faces appear. Identification of such faces as masks, and specifically of katsinas, is well attested for ceramics, as well as rock art and wall murals. The resemblance to many modern katsinas, particularly the "chief' katsinas such as the Hopi Ewtoto, Taawa (Sun), Chakwaina, and various ogre kat- sinas, are obvious. Hopi and Zuni consultants consistently have identified the de- signs shown here, and those cited by others, as katsinas, although a modern analog cannot always be provided for each example. The identification, origins, and distribution of katsina iconography have been addressed by several authors 297</page><page sequence="2">298 HAYS (Adams 1988; Cole, this volume; Di Peso 1974; Ferg 1982; Schaafsma and Schaafsma 1974; Schaafsma 1980; Smith 1952; Young 1988). This study, in con- trast, addresses the possible economic, social, and ideological roles of the katsina cult at Homol'ovi. Katsinas appear on three ceramic wares found at the Homol'ovi sites: White Mountain Red Ware, Jeddito Yellow Ware, and Winslow Orange Ware (for more information on the pottery and its classification, see Carlson 1970; Smith 1971; Hays 1989). The development of these wares, each produced in a different region, reflects pan-Puebloan changes that took place in the art of ceramic production and decoration at about A.D. 1300. In the Upper Little Colorado River region, a tech- nical and stylistic pinnacle of artistic achievement was reached with what archae- ologists now call Four Mile Polychrome, the latest type in the White Mountain Red Ware. To the north, potters of the Hopi Mesas began making yellow-firing ceramics, such as Awatovi Black-on-yellow and Jeddito Black-on-yellow, and painting them with a variety of new designs. By A.D. 1400, they were producing Sikyatki Polychrome, with birds, animals, and katsinas rendered in red and black on a clear yellow ground (Bishop and others 1988). Situated between these two regions, and trading with both, Homol'ovi potters also experimented with new styles and subjects. Their products, called Winslow Orange Ware, are poorly documented, and the regional context of their designs are not yet well understood. Examples discussed here show that Homol'ovi potters of the A.D. 1300s not only had access to imported pottery bearing depictions of katsinas, but also depicted katsinas on their own local products. HUMANS AND KATSINAS ON POTTERY The katsina figures discussed and depicted here' are an inventory of all known examples with a Homol'ovi provenience. They should be viewed as exam- ples rather than a sample in the scientific sense because they come from many kinds of sources, most of them nonsystematic excavations. Included are vessels excavated by Fewkes (1898, 1904) at Homol'ovi I, II, and III (these examples are provenienced only as "Homolobi," but we know Fewkes only excavated exten- sively at Homol'ovi I) and Chevelon Ruin, now housed at the Smithsonian Institu- tion; vessels collected in the late 1890s by Dorsey, Burt, and Wattron at Homol'ovi I and II for the collections of the Field Museum of Natural History (many are published in Martin and Willis 1940, I photographed and drew others in June, 1988); the Homol'ovi Research Program's 1984 excavation at Homol'ovi II (Adams and Hays 1989); and three vessels from a private collection now available for study at the Arizona State Museum. These last were collected in the 1960s at Homol'ovi II. Anthropomorphic figures on pots from Homol'ovi can be divided into simple human figures, which usually have few or no facial features, and those that appear to wear masks, probably representing katsinas. Most of the katsina depictions</page><page sequence="3">Katsina Depictions 299 C a Figure 1. Human Figures: a, Jeddito Black-on-yellow ladle handle, "Homolobi" (USNM 157084); b, Awatovi Black-on-yellow ladle base, about 10 cm diameter, Homol'ovi II (in possession of Homol'ovi Research Program); c, Sikyatki Polychrome bowl interior, "Homolobi" (USNM 156690); d, Jeddito Black-on-yellow bowl, Chevelon (USNM 157402). show the mask only, but several also depict the entire body. In this study, the three categories are human figures, katsina masks, and katsina figures. Fewkes (1904:70) notes that "the drawings of human beings which have been found [in the Anasazi area] are for the most part of the rudest possible character," an observation that describes four of the Homol'ovi examples (Figure la-d), all on Jeddito Yellow Ware. Together with this observation, Fewkes depicts an early Sikyatki Polychrome jar with a human figure and footprints painted on the interior (Figure 1 c). The figure carries what may be a hammer and a spear in its upraised hands, but has no facial or other details. Figure lb has hair whorls, a style until re- cently worn by Hopi girls. A third anthropomorph (Figure I d), from Fewkes 1904:Fig. 13) has hair whorls or hair bobs and dots for eyes. The figure kicks both feet out to one side instead of posing rigidly like the others. A scene on a Jeddito Black-on-Yellow bowl from Chevelon Ruin might depict a woman giving birth (Figure Id). The woman's arms are long and winglike, and her womb is indicated by a fringed circle surrounding a simple dot, perhaps a navel. Two small figures appear between her legs, and she is flanked by two other small, solid figures in profile. Stylistically similar petroglyphs depicting childbirth are found near the Cottonwood Creek and Chevelon ruins. The heads of all the human figures are tiny, round, and minimally adorned. Two have a rigid "lizard-man" posture, with knees bent and arms raised. This posture is common in rock art figures known as "lizard-men," (or women, be-</page><page sequence="4">300 HAYS cause many have hair whorls) from the Pueblo I period, that also appear occasion- ally on pottery of most periods (for example, Martin and Willis 1940:145, 237; Morris 1927: Plate 256b; Moulard 1981:Plate 72; Olsen 1988:Fig. 29). The pos- ture of Figure 1 a resembles that of the hump-backed flute players also common in rock art and occasionally on pottery from earlier periods (for example Lister and Lister 1978:Fig. 23; Martin and Willis 1940:129; Olsen 1988:Fig. 25; Rohn 1971:171). The four human figures from Homol'ovi appear to represent the con- tinuation of a long-established Anasazi manner of depicting humans. This style differs from that of katsina depiction in form and in the emphasis given the face and head. The five examples from Homol'ovi of masked beings are depicted as full fig- ures (Figure 2a-e). Although poses are similar to those of the humans in Figure 1, all are much more elaborate facially than the previous examples. Three carefully drawn rectilinear figures hold hands across the design field of a Jeddito Black-on- yellow bowl from Homol'ovi I (Figure 2a). Their fringed legs bend to the side, perhaps to indicate dancing. Masks are decorated with simple horizontal hachure and a row of dots across the top. Some Hopi consultants suggested that these fig- ures might represent cumulus cloud katsinas; another thought they were a kind of butterfly maiden. Another rectangular mask appears on a second Jeddito Black- on-yellow bowl (Figure 2b). Only the lower half of the face is hachured, and a decorative design is added to the chin; this design is common on Kayenta-style pottery from the Pueblo III period as well as Pueblo IV. Arms again are bent at the elbows and raised. An Awatovi Black-on-yellow jar sherd (Figure 2c) from Homol'ovi II deposits dates to the mid-A.D. 1300s and depicts a tiny figure with a rectangular head, simple eyes and mouth, upraised arms, and shoulder decoration similar to that painted on the bodies of many modem katsinas. A large, elaborate katsina figure (Figure 2d; Martin and Willis 1940:frontispiece) on a Four Mile Polychrome bowl found at Homol'ovi I strikes the same bent-limb pose noted above, and wears a decorated garment. Note that the round mask is divided hori- zontally, the mouth is rectangular and toothed, and the eyes are elongated. These features appear again and again on the masks (see also Moulard 1981:Plate 73). Figure 2d is unique in having a solid arms-up, legs-down body on the exterior, and a very large, round-eyed mask on the inside. The placement of the usual broken banding line, or "life line," suggests horns. This figure appears on a Homolovi Polychrome bowl from Homol'ovi I. Most katsina depictions dispense with the body altogether and portray only the mask (Figures 3 through 5). The most common features are toothed mouths; elongated eyes; round, semicircular or rectangular heads adorned with hair, ruff, feathers or horns; and horizontally divided faces (Appendix A). Not enough examples of mask depictions have been found at Homol'ovi alone to generate a design grammar or to identify particular katsinas, and it is beyond the scope of this paper to collect further examples from other areas for comparison (but see Ferg</page><page sequence="5">Katsina Depictions 301 a b Figure 2.

Nonetheless, a few strong associations suggest that more or less discrete categories of masks are represented. For example, if there is a toothed mouth, then the eyes are elongated, either as flattened semi-circles, or dashes (Figures 3a-d, 4a-b). Of the eight masks with elongated eyes, seven have toothed mouths and one (Figure 3e) has a round mouth. Ruffs and rays extending from the head appear only on round or semicircular masks. Examples of these associations are found on all three wares. Finally, if the head shape is a triangle or an irregular rectilinear form, then the eyes are negative squares with dots in them (Figures 4f, 5b, d). The reader may question the identification of Figure 4d-f and Figure 5a-d as masks, but careful examination will show that they share many features with the more obvious examples. If the designs shown here are masks, they are highly abstract and ambiguous. They are included because many modem katsina masks</page><page sequence="6">302 HAYS b c d .e Figure 3.

These particular designs suggest masks but do not quite transcend the realm of normal geometric pottery designs. The eyes of four of these figures are the dot-in- negative-square element frequently found in Pueblo III pottery designs of both the Kayenta and Upper Little Colorado regions. The designs depicted in Figure 5c-d also are made up of geometric elements and motifs that would be at home on earlier vessels, but would most likely have been arranged in rotational configura- tions. The bilateral symmetry seen on these examples is characteristic of many Pueblo IV period designs, as are asymmetric layouts. Although each example is unique, regular co-occurrence of particular stylis- tic features in designs shows that some kind of sharing of ideas about designs took place between potters (Bishop and others 1988:330, 332). There are certain reg- ularities in form and in structure, the way the figure is placed in a total design field, that show each potter was working from shared ideal forms. Study of the manufacturing loci of the pots bearing conventionalized mask designs defines the</page><page sequence="7">Katsina Depictions 303 b c eC d f Figure 4.

In this case, ideas as well as pottery vessels were moving among the Hopi Mesas, the Upper Little Colorado region, and Homol'ovi. CHRONOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION OF KATSINA DEPICTIONS AT HOMOL'OVI There are six major sites in the Winslow, Arizona, area: Homol'ovi I-IV, Chevelon and Cottonwood Creek ruins, collectively known as Homol'ovi. All date primarily to the earlier Pueblo IV period, roughly A.D. 1275 to 1400. The examination of ceramic assemblages at each site (see Figures 1-5) shows that katchina depictions appear only after A.D. 1300 in the Homol'ovi sequence, ap- pear only at the three largest sites, and appear primarily, but not exclusively, on imported ceramic wares. Homol'ovi IV is an early Pueblo IV site dating to the late A.D. 1200s. Its sur- face assemblage suggests affiliation with the southern Black Mesa area.

Jeddito Yellow Ware is found, suggesting abandonment by A.D. 1300. No kat- sinas are depicted on the Homol'ovi IV vessels I saw in private collections. Homol'ovi III is a village of about 40 rooms that was occupied from about A.D. 1275 to 1300, and again, probably seasonally, in the early to mid- or late A.D. 1300s. Most of the decorated pottery at Homol'ovi III, especially in the early deposits, is locally made Winslow Orange Ware. Cibola White Ware and White Mountain Red Ware were imported from the south, mainly Pinedale Black-on- white and Cedar Creek Polychrome in early deposits, and Four Mile Polychrome in the late occupation. Jeddito Yellow Ware, imported from the Hopi Mesas, ap- pears in very low frequencies (.1% to 5% of decorated ware) in the early levels, and becomes much more common (up to 50%) in the debris of the later occupation. Use of locally manufactured pottery was decreasing as importation of Jeddito Yellow increased during the early to mid-1300s. Lack of Sikyatki Poly- chrome suggests that the site was no longer used after the mid- to late A.D. 1300s (for probable dates of production of specific pottery types, see Smith 1971, Carlson 1982:220, and Breternitz 1966).</page><page sequence="9">Katsina Depictions 305 Homol'ovi III has been excavated extensively by the Homol'ovi Research program, and many at least partially reconstructible vessels have been recovered in addition to tens of thousands of decorated sherds. These include about a dozen life-form depictions, including birds, quadrupeds, and lizards. No human or mask depictions have been found. Adams notes in his article on Homol'ovi III (this vol- ume) that the kivas at Homol'ovi III were abandoned by A.D. 1300, and filled in by the later, seasonal inhabitants, suggesting that many, if not all, ritual activities took place at one of the larger, aggregated villages. This pattern also may account for the lack of katsina depictions on Homol'ovi III pottery. There is as yet little information on the ceramics from the Cottonwood Creek Ruin, a site intermediate in size between Homol'ovi I and Homol'ovi III, but Jed- dito Yellow Ware is the most common ware on the site surface. Its frequency even exceeds all utility ware combined, suggesting occupation into the mid- to late A.D. 1300s. Again, no katsina depictions were seen on privately owned vessels from the site. Homol'ovi I, Homol'ovi II, and Chevelon are much larger ruins, all probably occupied until about A.D. 1400, after the abandonment of the smaller sites. Sikyatki Polychrome, although rare, appears among other types of Jeddito Yellow Ware. This is the most common decorated pottery ware at all three late sites; rela- tively little Winslow Orange Ware is found. White Mountain Red Ware, especially Four Mile Polychrome, continues to be an important southern import. Katsina masks appear on Jeddito Yellow Ware at all three sites, and on White Mountain Red Ware and Winslow Orange Ware at Homol'ovi I and Chevelon. Masks are absent on earlier (pre-A.D. 1300) pottery types found at these sites and others in the western Colorado Plateau region, such as types in the Little Colorado White Ware, Tusayan White Ware, Tsegi and Jeddito Orange Wares. (They do appear on Tularosa and Pinedale Black- on-white of the Cibola White Ware at other sites to the south, see Ferg 1982.) In sum, life forms are not especially common on pottery found at the Homol'ovis, nor at any other Anasazi sites. Bird and animal forms occur on most kinds of pottery and at all of the Homol'ovi sites. But masks and masked figures have been found only at the largest sites, suggesting that the katsina cult was not practiced at the contemporaneous smaller sites nor at those abandoned before A.D. 1300. Katsina iconography, then, is temporally and spatially associated with large, aggregated villages. CONTEXT AND MEANING OF KATSINA DEPICTIONS As E. C. Adams notes in the introduction to this volume, evidence for the katsina cult appears at the time of greatest growth of the Homol'ovi settlements. Aggregated communities needed ways to integrate their membership when popu- lations became too large to reach consensus by face-to-face interaction among in- dividuals (Johnson 1982, 1989). Communities also needed, at least sometimes, to</page><page sequence="10">306 HAYS facilitate intersettlement interaction, such as trade, exchange of marriage partners, and temporary or permanent migrations. The elaboration of ritual or- ganizations, events, and paraphernalia was one solution that was developed. The katsina cult would have been a particularly important development in the Pueblo world when it took on its present role as a popular religion. Pueblos appar- ently have long had many war, healing, and rainmaking sodalities, each of which initiated a limited number of males from the community. Women also had such sodalities. Pueblo society is not egalitarian in terms of social and political power, which is clearly wielded by the priestly class. But the katsina cult, especially at Hopi, is open to all. Any girl or boy can be initiated at about seven or eight years old. Such an overarching organization, with its message of community unity, cooperation, and adherence to the "natural" social order, can be seen as an ideology in the sense that it helped obscure or mask social and political inequalities. It is easy to see why an overarching ideology and a cult in which all could par- ticipate would have helped to hold together growing communities whose members probably came from different regions and had their own esoteric sodalities. It is more difficult to prove with archaeological evidence alone that the appearance of katsina iconography at aggregated Homol'ovi sites in the fourteenth century rep- resents the formation of such a social structure. One line of evidence that can be pursued is a thorough examination of the appearance of the katsina depictions, first in different media (that is, which kinds of items have the designs and which do not), and then in the visual contexts of media and designs (or, which items could be seen and used by people of different residence, gender, and age groups). By looking at the different media that bear katsina depictions it is possible to show that most belong to a Pueblo IV iconography. Iconography is defined here as the visual representation of religious or legendary subjects by conventional images and symbols. To show that some of the conventionalized images described above are part of an iconographic system, it must be shown that they most probably represent religious or legendary subjects. We cannot know what ancient people thought or said about katsina designs, but we can know something about how they used the objects that bear the designs. There is no evidence that vessels depicting katsinas were used in ritual ac- tivities. Although depositional context is unknown for most of the examples pre- sented here, most probably came from burials because we know that Fewkes and Wattron excavated primarily for burials. The Homol'ovi Research Program examples were found in domestic and refuse deposits. Kivas, structures that are interpreted as the primary loci of ritual activities, have not yielded more vessels with life-form designs than any other kind of structure or midden. In addition, some katsina-bearing vessels, from all kinds of deposits, show a moderate degree of use wear similar to wear found on vessels with geometric designs only. It is still possible, however, that uses were different. For example, vessels with "special"</page><page sequence="11">Katsina Depictions 307 designs may have been curated as heirlooms more frequently than others (but re- call that at least the yellow and red ware vessels shown here were produced after A.D. 1300, and deposited by A.D. 1400). But we can compare pottery designs with designs found in other media that we think were used primarily in ritual activities: kiva murals, and carved and painted stone objects. One kiva mural has been recorded at Homol'ovi II (Pond 1966). The upper parts of the panel had eroded away, but the lower portion depicts human torsos and legs. These resemble the full, masked figures on murals in Awatovi kivas, which were certainly made and used in a ritual context (Smith 1952:163). Many of the mask depictions on the Awatovi murals (Smith 1952:294- 306) bear a strong resemblance to the ceramic designs described above, most of which appear on yellow ware vessels manufactured on the Hopi Mesas. A stone slab (Figure 5e) in the Smithsonian collections was labeled as "re- moved by Fewkes from Little Colorado Ruins." It shows a rectangular face with features similar to mask depictions on pottery: elongated eyes and a rectangular toothed mouth. It also has a yellow band across the chin and a decorated band around the perimeter. Painted slabs also were found in graves at Kawaika-a, a fif- teenth century site on Antelope Mesa, where they were associated with Jeddito Black-on-yellow and Sikyatki Polychrome ceramics. The slabs depict birds, clouds, and dragonflies. Stone slabs with mask designs were found at Kinishba and Point of Pines (Smith 1952:267-268; Di Peso 1950). Smith (1952:261-262) suggests that the slabs were probably used originally as altar paraphernalia be- cause similar pieces were so used in the ethnographic present. In assessing the social role of the katsina cult, it is important to ask which members of the population had access to katsina iconography. If it was a popular religion, as it is today, then we would expect the designs to be available to all. Fourteenth-century katsinas are depicted on pottery found in all kinds of deposi- tional contexts, and in on-site rock art (Cole, this volume), suggesting that the de- signs were visible to all. If knowledge of katsinas was esoteric and restricted, then one would only expect to find them depicted in remote shrines and shelters, or in nonpublic deposits such as kivas and perhaps burials. Thus, mask designs may have been important public symbols in Pueblo reli- gion of the fourteenth century. But the specific symbolic meanings of these katsina designs, their iconology, cannot be known from the archaeological record alone. It is hoped that such meanings will be pursued in further research. Redis- covering or reformulating the meanings that these designs might have had for their makers can be assisted by looking at recent and modern Pueblo religion. For over a century, ethnographers and historians have asked living practitioners of native religions the meaning of symbols appearing on wall murals, altars, textiles, baskets, and pottery. A symbol is by definition an arbitrary, or conventional, association between image and meaning. A symbolic system is therefore not only</page><page sequence="12">308 HAYS mutable and flexible, but is subject to deliberate manipulation. One must take care not to forget that even the most conservative art styles and religions change over time as a result of any number of internal and external forces. There is a gap of over 500 years and 85 kilometers between some of the modern Hopi clans and their Homol'ovi ancestors, but finding and following the many lines of continuity should provide much of interest to symbol-minded archaeologists of the future. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Although a burden for only 21 figures to support, it was concluded that mask depictions appear suddenly on pottery in the Homol'ovi area in the early to mid- A.D. 1300s, and are associated with large, aggregated sites. Although evidence for ritual use of these vessels is lacking, kiva murals and stone slabs bearing simi- lar designs were used ritually, suggesting that mask depictions belong to a religi- ous iconography. The public visual context of the designs, when found on rock art and pottery, suggests that all members of the community had access to this iconography, which is also the case with the modern katsina cult. This study also has shown that items occurring rarely in the archaeological record can be used to answer interesting questions. Museum and private collections can be useful even if they lack precise proveniences. Finally, some aspects of art and religion are not only accessible, but are amenable to archaeological investiga- tion. To address problems of social organization and adaptation, it is not necessary to identify each katsina, such as Snow, Ogre, and Warrior Maiden, nor to know their many connotative meanings, such as moisture, fertility, and clan affiliations. Rather, we can learn a great deal from the contexts of designs in terms of time, space, culture area, functional and depositional associations. Acknowledgments.

Most drawings were done by me from color slides using a tracing apparatus. Those designs done from my reconstructions are Figures 2a, 2e, 3c, 3d, and 4f. Reconstruction was done primarily to flat- ten designs from their original three-dimensional context inside bowls with strongly incurved rims. It should be noted that for bowls that have been traced from photographs, the incurved rim obscures part of the design, including the banding line just under the rim (this line virtually always has a deliberate break, sometimes called the "spirit break," in Jeddito Yellow Ware and Winslow Orange Ware, but not Four Mile Polychrome). Sources of those redrawn by tracing from published photographs are so noted in their captions. I regret that no scale is available for the illustrations. Bowls of unknown scale measure between 15 cm and 25 cm in diameter. REFERENCES CITED Adams, E. Charles 1980 An Archaeological Assessment ofHomolovi I Ruin.
