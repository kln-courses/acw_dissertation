<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS * AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. IX, No. 1: January, 1972 On Coherence of Factual Beliefs and Practical Attitudes, STEPHEN K?RNER Descartes on His Substance and His Essence, DAVID S. SCARROW Descartes' claim that he is a substance which thinks and that thought alone is essential to him is generally supposed to rest upon an epistemo logical argument, albeit a patently fallacious one. I argue rather that Descartes rests these claims upon principles which are manifest in his theoretical physics. In his physics he regards the essence of body both as the determinable of which modes are determinates and the. determiner by which modes are determined. This bodily essence is extension. Since thoughts are not modes of extension, they must be modes of a substance with a different essence, namely, thought. And since each substance has only one essence, thought alone is essential to any thinking substance. This interpretation accords with a careful reading of the Second and Sixth Meditations as well as with the relevant discussions elsewhere. Semantics for Logical and Nomic Modalities, NICHOLAS LA PARA The central intention of the article is to provide an acceptable philo sophical basis for nomic modality, one that will be helpful in the logical analysis of physical laws, conditionals, and related concepts. To this end, a semantic method is presented for interpreting languages containing logical modalities, nomic modalities, identity, definite descriptions (per haps non-referring), and non-referring names. Interpretations are also provided for two sorts of universal quantifiers, one ranging over just actuals, one ranging over actuals and possibles. This is done without the Platonic postulation of "real" possibles. The questions raised by the "referential opacity" of modalities are resolved by the semantics. The article also contains a brief discussion of hypothetical reasoning, and a criterion for synonymy of predicates. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

MARTIN The standard view of basic actions takes them to be simple actions and rules out a priori such apparently non-simple actions as skating and opening a door by turning the knob. It is argued that these actions, indeed any actions, can be basic actions and that the basic/non-basic and simple/non-simple distinctions should be separated. The argument begins by challenging the assumption that basic actions are "gifts." The assump tion that doings such as moving one's hand to open the door are always actions is then questioned. It is held that only doings to which one attends are actions. But then, given that a basic action is one which is not done by doing some other action, many of the things which on the standard view are necessarily non-basic actions can be performed as basic actions. Whether they are in fact performed as basic actions is an empirical question. Meaning and Illocutions, DAVID COOPER At first sight, a bewildering number of apparently incompatible theses concerning the relationship between meaning and illocutions have been proposed. In fact none of these theses, when analysed, are incom patible at all, and there is a single thesis which the various authors dis cussed?Austin, Alston, Holdcroft, and Cohen?could agree upon. The dispute between Austin and Cohen, for example, as to whether illocutionary force is separate from meaning turns out to be a merely verbal issue. And disputes as to whether meaning can be explained by reference to illocu tions only arise because of a failure to make a certain distinction between the particular and the general use of a sentence. Are Transcendental Arguments a Version of Verificationism, PETER HACKER Adjusters and Sense Data, SAM COVAL Indifference and Moral Acceptance, MALCOLM SMITH The author here considers what can be said for internalism, viz., the view that no one can accept a moral judgment unless he has a favorable or an unfavorable attitude towards that thing which the judgment is about. He contends that the arguments in favor of internalism are inconclusive, and that the considerations which make it intuitively plausible can be explained consistently with its denial. In the paper's concluding section, he points out that noncognitive ethical theories have relied heavily upon internalism, and he argues that his contentions about internalism seriously weaken such theories.</page><page sequence="3">580 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS What's Happening in Philosophy of Language Today?A Metaphysician's Eye View, JAY F. ROSENBERG On the Ontological Status of History, NATHAN ROTENSTREICH * The article takes issue with three philosophical positions whose com mon trend is to deduce history from a basic factor outside history proper: The systems analysed are Hegel and his theory of Spirit, Marx and his theory of production as a primary historical factor and Heidegger and his theory of Time and future. Constructively, the paper suggests that the awareness of time is presupposed in history and by it. The awareness of time runs parallel in two directions?both towards the past and towards the future. The common feature of the intentionality towards these two dimensions of time is the transcendence of the present moment. Two basic human experiences: the awareness of one's being a descendent of his predecessors and the acquisition of language reinforce the historical inter pretation of the basic reflection upon time. Identity Through Time, D. ODEGARD ** Two views on identity through time are often thought to be exhaustive, and each has attracted its advocates. According to one an identity state ment is always, or always elliptical for, a statement of the form "a is the same f as b," hence, "a is the same F as b, but not the same G" is accept able. The opposing view rejects both the ellipsis thesis and the relativity of identity. The alternatives are not exhaustive, however, since it is pos sible to reject the ellipsis thesis while retaining identity's relativity. A defence of the third, frequently unnoticed, alternative is offered. AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. IL, No. 3: December, 1971 Referential Opacity, ALAN REEVES Quine's definitions of "purely referential position" and "referential opacity" are too simple. They do not allow distinctions that are shown to be necessary by an examination of cases. For example: (i) a context might influence some but not all of the singular term positions within its scope; (ii) we must distinguish the possibility of substitution for a term in * Mr. Rotenstreich's article appeared in Vol. VIII, No. 4: December, 1971. ** Mr. Odegard's article appeared in Vol. VIII, No. 4: December, 1971.</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 581 a position from that of substitution for any term in that position; (iii) we must distinguish the possibility of substituting within a sentence or term in a context from that of substituting within any sentence or term in that context. Exact definitions are given of concepts that take into account such complications. It is remarked that analogous complications will be needed in definitions of "extensional context" and "truth-functional context." "Ought" and "Can," MICHAEL STOCKER Focusing primarily on the "ought" of the Doctrine that "ought" implies "can," three questions are considered: (i) which "ought" is this? (ii) for which notions does it stand? (iii) what is qualified by it? It is shown that the Doctrine is plausible and correct only if (a) restricted to overall moral evaluations of specific acts, which (b) are also agent evaluations (e.g., "blameworthily"), and (c) where inability is inculpable. Tolerance of Rudolf Carnap, D. GOLDSTICK Carnap is the author of the influential suggestion that frequently disputes between rival philosophies, insofar as they are not simply irra tional, "metaphysical" pseudodisagreements, are really disputes over which of a set of alternative languages to speak. The only theoretical considera tions relevant to any such practical question are pragmatic, Carnap holds; but since pragmatic utilit?s also are only calculable within the framework of a particular language, for Carnap the adoption of a philosophical posi tion will at bottom amount to a non-cognitive decision akin to an existential "commitment" or leap-of-faith. This Carnapian "principle of tolerance" is attacked dilemmatically in a crucial example. Energy and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. C. A. HOOKER A precise abstract argument is presented to show that if it be granted that time is a continuum and that the temporal duration of any physical state is determined by a closed interval on the real line, then, under the quantum assumption of only finite energy transition, it (i) takes a finite time for each such transition and (ii) during that finite time no precise energy can consistently be attributed to the system undergoing that transi tion. Further, it is shown, using physical examples, that the doctrine that quantum effects are accounted for by the physical disturbance of the measured system during the measurement interaction is erroneous.</page><page sequence="5">582 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Plato's Theory of Causality: Phaedo 95-106, M. J. CRESSWELL This is in part a reply to an article by C. C. W. Taylor in Mind 1969 claiming it to be impossible to discover any coherent theory of causal explanation in the Phaedo. The paper attempts to show that Plato puts forward a theory of causality which, whether or not it is an adequate theory, does not yield to the objections Plato brings against the causal theories of the presocratic physicists. The Two Doctrines of Distribution, THOMAS J. RICHARDS Two closely-linked but separate accounts of distribution of terms in traditional logic are discerned, both dating back to medieval times. These two notions, Universalization- and Instantiation-Distribution, are formalized in "Existential Theory"?first-order quantification theory buttressed with existential assumptions to match the needs of traditional logic. It is shown that if a term is U-distributed in a sentence then it is I-distributed, and that the converse does not hold. Finally, the law of Valid Process is proved not to hold for I-distribution, and the law of Distributed Middle not to hold for either sort. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XI, No. 4: December, 1971 Spontaneity and Alienation, NATHAN ROTENSTREICH The paper suggests a distinction between alienation as a perversion of human spontaneity and objective or semi-objective creations which are continuations of human spontaneity. Alienation as a perversion occurs when the human being is subjected to the control of other human beings and is used as a commodity. As against this, language is a semi-objective structure and thus a paradigm of human creativity which enlarges the scope of human existence and does not contract or suppress that scope. There is a current tendency to identify alienation with objectivization, taking spontaneity as the principle and as the norm. The present paper suggests that a distinction has to be maintained between these two atti tudes towards the preservation of human spontaneity.</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 583 Lonergan and Dewey on Judgment, ROBERT 0. JOHANN After briefly indicating the large-scale differences between the philos ophies of Lonergan and Dewey, the author analyzes the positions of the two men on the nature of judgment and finds a surprising similarity not only of doctrine but even of expression. For both men, the matter of final judgment?that, namely, to which the "yes" of judgment is essentially correlative?is a qualitative state of affairs resulting from the very process of inquiry and immediately "had" (in Dewey's sense) as a settled basis for further intelligent activity. This leads the author to suggest that Lonergan needs something like Dewey's conception of the primacy and ultimacy of gross, qualitative experience to make his own theory of inquiry consistent, and that Dewey's position about the qualitative context guiding inquiry pre supposes a native orientation on the part of the inquirer not wholly unlike Lonergan's "pure desire to know." Gandhi's God, S. C. THAKUR The article begins with the general claim that the most fundamental concept in Gandhian philosophy is "truth" ("Truth" in religious contexts), and not "non-violence" or "Satyagraha," as might generally be supposed. The author cites evidence and presents arguments in support of his claim that the main tenets of Gandhi's political, moral and religious philosophy can in some sense be seen to be entailed by his commitment to truth. In this connection, the author analyses Gandhi's well-known identification of God with Truth, and suggests that Truth (and hence God) be understood as denoting "the entire set of laws of being" (including the ones yet to be discovered). This interpretation, the author argues, is not only philo sophically defensible, but even has some clear advantages over more anthropomorphic notions of God; and, for that very reason, may well provide a basis for "the religion of the future." The Dialogue Parmenides: Insoluble in Platonism? HANS ROCHOL The author is concerned with the unity of Plato's dialogue Parmen ides, in other words: with the content and meaning of the "One," and the basic concept of the so-called "enigmatic" hypothetical derivations, the "hypotheses," in the second part of the dialogue. He derives the strict identity of the non-existent One at the end of the first hypothesis and of the existent One at the beginning of the second hypothesis wih a non enigmatic non-existent and a non-enigmatic existent One, the latter being called the idea, in the first part of the dialogue. Thus he proves both the unity of the dialogue and the identity of the "enigmatic" One with the Platonic idea such as it appears e.g., in Phaedo, the Republic, and Timaeus.</page><page sequence="7">584 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Aesthetic Proximity: An Agency of Belief, BEREL LANG After a review of the emphasis given the concept of "aesthetic dis tance" in the current literature, the author attempts to point up the imbalance produced by that emphasis. If anything, he argues, the account of art's power is more fundamentally rooted in the concept of "aesthetic proximity." The analysis attempts to show how that concept can be brought to bear on the traditional questions of truth and belief in art; its usefulness in this connection is viewed as further evidence of the per tinence of the concept. Zen in Heidegger's Gelassenheit, PETER KREEFT Abortion: Parameters for Decision, RUDOLF J. GERBER The Principle of "Acting by Not Acting," in Tao Te Ching, PAUL TAN CHEE ING, s.j.* This article attempts a global understanding of The Tao Te Ching's principle of action and non-action. It must be interpreted in its total context: the historical background, the Yin-yang influence, and the es sential metaphysical perspective of The Tao Te Ching. If looked at from this angle, the principle does not become quietism, but a metaphysical principle for all action to achieve harmony within and without a person. There are three vital elements to this principle. (1) Because in everything there is the interaction of Yin and Yang, so in action too there must be this interaction. Thus, action (ya'ng) must be counteracted by non-action (yin). (2) This interaction must be in proper proportion to attain harmony which means that it must be natural or "spontaneous." (3) Since action is determined by the particular object of the act, it must open itself out to the non-particular?the Universal. * Father Ing's article appeared in Vol. XI, No. 3: September, 1971.</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 585 JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. X, No. 1: January, 1972 Plato's Parmenides: The Structure of the First Hypothesis, JAMES WILLIAM FORRESTER The author presents a reading of the structure of the First Hypothesis of the second part of Plato's Parmenides (137c4-142a8) with the intention of vindicating "positive" interpretations of the hypothesis (i.e., those inter pretations which take Plato to be expressing in a straightforward manner what he believes to be truths about an entity termed "The One"). The author holds that the end of the First Hypothesis, which both interlocutors find unsatisfactory, is meant to disprove a premiss introduced late into the hypothesis. Why Plato introduced a premiss he knew to be faulty is explained by general considerations of the structure of the second part of the Parmenides. Henry of Ghent on Internal Sensation, J. V. BROWN Taking as his point of departure the idea that Henry of Ghent (?-1293) was neither a theologian nor a philosopher, but a polemicist, the author tries to show that while the Solemn Doctor's ideas on the internal senses are presented unsystematically, there is, nevertheless, a systematic theory of internal sensation. "Common Sense," Sense Memory and Imagination are dealt with. It is the progressive absence of the singular object sensed that determines the nature of the object of each of the internal senses. "Absence" is interpreted in terms of Henry's teachings on intentio and ratio. The article is mainly one of historical exposition. Quotations from the two major works of Henry, together with references to the works of those who influenced him, are provided in the footnotes. Hobbes on Obligation, Moral and Political?Part Two: Political Obligation, STANLEY MOORE In Part One it was shown that according to Hobbes the principle of equal treatment is essential for moral obligation. His model of sovereignty by institution, as his model of the state of nature, is construct ed on the assumption that all men are equal in power. His model of sovereignty by acquisition is constructed on the contrary assumption. It follows from his premises that in commonwealths by institution, if sovereigns act prudently, subjects' legal obligations harmonize with their moral obligations. But in commonwealths by acquisition, if sovereigns act prudently, subjects' legal and moral obligations conflict. Hobbes's model of sovereignty by institution is a fiction, constructed on assumptions contrary to fact. Its rhetorical function is to conceal the logical incom patibility of a quietist account of men's duties as subjects and a subversive account of their duties as men.</page><page sequence="9">586 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Materialism and Natural Events in Dewey's Developing Thought, ROBERT J. RICHARDS In this article the question of materialism provides a directive focus both for the examination of a problem which occupied Dewey throughout his career and for the consideration of his theories of inquiry and expe rience with their peculiar ontic commitments. There are three well defined stages in Dewey's thought concerning materialism and the various meanings of the term. The early, neo-Hegelian Dewey rejected the doctrine of materialism as unclear and illogical. The second movement of his thought, reaching definition with Experience and Nature, brought a repudia tion of both spiritualism and materialism; mind and matter are properties of natural events, rather than one being a property of the other. With the epistemological explorations of his Logic and work with Bentley, Dewey moved from an interactional to a transactional analysis of natural events, and consequently accepted, in one sense of the term, the epithet "mate rialist." In order to expose the roots of his shifting views it is necessary to investigate Dewey's theories of inquiry and experience. A close scrutiny of these theories reveals in Dewey's thought a fundamental continuity, bringing certain ontic commitments which are at odds with his own characterization of his later position on materialism. These commitments suggest that Dewey was never "really" a materialist. Intellectual Analysis in Bergson's Theory of Knowing, MARY CHRISTINE MORKOVSKY, C.D.P. Near the beginning of the second chapter of Creative Evolution, Henri Bergson briefly outlines a method for conducting philosophical investiga tions. Although intuition of duration is for him the most valuable kind of knowledge, he insists that it must be preceded by intellectual analyses. This article examines two of the detailed analyses Bergson himself makes of the human self in Time and Free Will and of life in Creative Evolution. After tracing directions of activity, he arrives at tendencies and eventually at an indivisible impetus. Intellect or reason can reach only the past and the fixed, but Bergson's method of convergence accumulates prob abilities and prepares for intuition of creative novelty. Others can achieve a non-intellectual type of certitude in the same way provided they do not mistake the objects of intellectual analyses for ultimate reality. Love and Natural Desire in Ficino's Platonic Theology, ARDIS B. COLLINS* The Aristotelians of the Renaissance insisted that philosophy is independent of religious teaching. Ficino answers them by revealing a necessary continuity between philosophy and religion. He establishes his position on the basis of a metaphysics inspired by Thomas Aquinas. Since a creature takes its whole reality from God's creative act, the fundamental * Ardis Collins' article appeared in Vol. IX, No. 4: October, 1971.</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 587 reality or being of creatures is their relation to God. And since human knowledge and will are directed toward being, every properly human activity implicitly seeks the divinity. But God is infinite and man is finite. Human nature demands what it cannot achieve; it is a desire to transcend itself. God answers this desire by placing in man a love which leads to the divinity he cannot comprehend. Plotinus has inspired Ficino's description of this love. But Ficino identifies it with the natural desire described by Thomistic theology, thus integrating the Platonic and Thomistic aspects of his thought. Pierre Charron s View of the Source of Wisdom, MARYANNE CLINE HOROWITZ* The contention of this paper is that Pierre Charron 's De la Sagesse is fundamentally a neo-Stoic moral treatise. The author shows that in the 1601 edition and more clearly in the 1604 edition, Charron attacks the Aristotelian theory of sense knowledge not only from the perspective of Pyrrhonism but also from the perspective of the Stoic theory of natural law in man. It is argued that the root idea of the work is the assertion of the existence in man of natural seeds of virtue and knowledge which provide man with the potentialities for knowing and willing the content of natural law. The author interprets Charron 's scepticism to be primarily a preparatory device for freeing man's esprit from the pursuit of and adherance to particular truths in order that it may guide man to become a preud'homme, a wise man. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXVIII, No. 15 Vices v. Self Knowledge, MARGARET GILBERT This paper concerns the logic of ascriptions of evil character and specific vices, concentrating on the former. I argue that the self-ascription of evil, while not as peculiar as has been supposed, possesses some peculiar features. There are certain specifiable relationships between the self ascription of evil, self-falsification, and "objectivation" (seeing oneself as an object). Other-ascription lacks these particular connections. Do these findings support the thesis (here called Spectatorism) that character trait concepts are fitted for other ascription rather than for self-ascription? I consider whether they bear out a Spectatorism regarding vice concepts, and conclude that the facts gathered here can at most support a very mild form of that thesis. * Maryanne Horowitz's article appeared in Vol. IX, No. 4: October, 1971.</page><page sequence="11">588 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Vol. LXVIII, No. 16 A Proposed Definition of Propositional Knowledge, PETER KLEIN A satisfactory definition of propositional knowledge must (i) be acceptable to rival epistemological theorists, (ii) do justice to most of our intuitions and (iii) be free from counter-examples. It is argued that the proposed definition satisfies those three conditions. The definition is: S knows that p at tx iff (1) p is true, (2) S believes p at tx, (3) p is evident for S at tx, and (4) there is no true proposition such that if it were to become evident to S, p would no longer be evident. It is claimed that there can be no counter-examples to the definition and that, in spite of appear ances, the fourth condition does not lead to skepticism, although it is compatible with various forms of skepticism. Vol. LXVIII, No. 17 Is Scientific Metaphysics Possible, MARIO BUNGE A theory belongs in scientific metaphysics if, in addition to having a definite mathematical structure, it is consonant and even contiguous with science. Three examples are exhibited and discussed: assembly theory, which elucidates and systematizes the concepts of juxtaposition and inter penetration of individuals; analysis and synthesis theory, or the theory of the emergence of novelty through the formation or dissociation of wholes; and automata theory, or the grey box view of systems determined by their environment. These theories are metaphysical by virtue of their generality and their reference to reality. And they are scientific because consistent with science and moreover transformable into specific scientific theories upon being enriched with special assumptions. No frontier between metaphysics and science remains. The paper is a preliminary progress report. Vol. LXVIII, No. 18 Intentionality Via Intensions, DAVID WOODRUFF SMITH and RONALD MCINTYRE The influence on analytic philosophy of the notion of sense or meaning as refined by Frege is as obvious as it is important. Seldom recognized, however, is the importance of this same notion for the theory of inten tionality that Husserl propounded as the basis of phenomenology. Husserl accepted Brentano 's characterization of acts of consciousness (seeing, believing, etc.) as intentional, i.e. directed toward objects. But his phenomenological theory of intentionality is distinguished by a sophisticated dependence upon intensional entities. Husserl says that his notion of act meaning ("noema") is a generalization of the concept of linguistic sense.</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 589 This paper seeks to establish the precise sense in which he conceived this to be true and to detail the role that intensional entities play in Husserl's theory. In particular, we conclude, noemata are to "direct" acts by individuating objects of consciousness, where those objects themselves are typically ordinary, non-intensional, individuals. MIND Vol. LXXX, No. 318: July, 1971 Conforming to Custom, D. W. CRAWFORD Is there a jutification for the belief that we ought generally to conform to customs? The answers usually given to this question are examined and judged to be inadequate with respect to customs which have no moral basis. Nonetheless there is an important relation between custom and morality: customs, being conventional practices, can give rise to obliga tions, for sometimes the failure to conform will have moral implications which we have an obligation in general to avoid. MONIST Vol. LVI, No. 1: January, 1972 The Laws of War, RICHARD A. WASSERSTROM Compensatory Justice and the Black Manifesto, HUGO A. BEDAU Visceral Racism, IRVING THALBERG I distinguish individual attitudes and behavior from collective ideology and practices. On the individual level, I contrast the frankly hostile attitude of white supremacists with an outlook which seems to be endemic among white liberals. On the collective plane, I differentiate explicit segregation from "built-in" or institutional racism, which keeps non-whites out of decision-making roles by indirect means. The outlook which interests me is most clearly displayed toward black Americans. I call it visceral racism. A viscerally racist liberal is not a supremacist in disguise ?a latent, or even an unconscious supremacist. Rather, he systematically misperceives social phenomena involving black people. He screens out the harsh facts of institutional racism, and sees black "progress." He ignores the long tradition of black resistance, or sees only "rioting"* and "looting." I attempt a detailed analysis of these and other linguistic manifestations of an attitude one would never take if whites were involved.</page><page sequence="13">590 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Paternalism, GERALD DWT0RKIN The author defines paternalism as interference with a person's liberty of action justified by reasons referring exclusively to the welfare, good, happiness, needs, interests or values of the person being deprived of liberty. After some further analysis of the concept, Mill's arguments against all paternalism are examined and it is argued that there are two distinct argu ments to be found in Mill?one Utilitarian and one which attributes to liberty an intrinsic value. The author then goes on to develop an argu ment schema for deciding under what conditions paternalism is justified. It is argued that there are kinds of situations which make it plausible to suppose that rational individuals would agree to have their liberty restricted for paternalistic reasons. Finally two principles are suggested as limita tions on such interventions. Obligations to Future Generations, MARTIN GOLDING Prestige and the Logic of Political Argument, ROBERT E. MCGINN An analysis of the concept of prestige is offered which captures the flavor of this concept as it is most frequently used in contemporary political and social discourse. Several definitions which confuse prestige with influence, reputation, power and esteem are criticized, and a new definition is proposed: "the reservoir of favorable opinion accorded an individual by members of a group." Three senses of "favorable opinion" are noted corresponding to the multiple uses to which this concept is put, and criteria for its proper application are formulated and discussed. Specimens of political argument couched in terms of the concept of prestige are examined (e.g. "X ought not abrogate its commitment to Y, for X has committed its prestige in situation Z [involving Y]"). Finally, it is shown that the appeal of such arguments often rests on a defective con ceptual model, here christened the Poker Chip Model of Prestige. Methodology of Confirming the Effectiveness of Public Policy, VIRGINIA BLACK Can philosophy be enlisted in support of a more rational and ethically based social life? This paper describes how policy-making can become less ad hoc and contradictory by using a method in which partial implica tion yields "ideological implicates" as correspondence rules which logically connect fundamental moral beliefs to policies or laws that may then be said to instantiate them. The method requires these steps: (1) a moral norm is defined; (2) ideological implicates are ascribed to the norms on the basis of various considerations; (3) these implicates are translatable as policies that must also function as rules of evidence; (4) empirical evi dence must then be found to determine whether a policy is effective. By this route, the same criteria that justify one policy in preference to another also confirm the effectiveness of that policy in instantiating a moral belief. The advantage of using this method is twofold: It yields an objective measure of the relative effectiveness of alternative policies that are being evaluated. It assists in discovering laws needed for ethical social guidance.</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 591 THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. XLVI, No. 1: Winter, 1972 Maritain's Ninetieth Birthday, JOSEPH W.

Chisholm main tains that timeless states of affairs are necessary to an adequate account of recurrence and of the propositional attitudes, and suffice to explain adverbial modification and inference. The present article urges that Chisholm has not shown how to dispense with an ontology that contains, perhaps in addition to states of affairs particular, dated, events like explosions, strolls, and birthday parties. On Davidson's Paratactic Theory of Oblique Contexts, R. J. HAACK Davidson offers a rationale for construing a sentence such as (1) Galileo said that the earth moves, as two; namely, (2) Galileo said that: the earth moves. The demonstrative of the first allows us to think of it as referring to the second. It is alleged that the failure of substituting into (1) of co-referentials is resolved and that (l)-type sentences are amen able to a truth condition theory of meaning. We allege that this theory faces difficulties concerned with (a) reference and sentence composition, (b) reference and truth, (c) iterated oblique contexts, (d) Davidson's use of a notion of samesaying as primitive and (e) indeterminacy of transla tion.</page><page sequence="15">592 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Truth, Quantification, and Abstract Objects, LESLIE H. THARP Value, Alternatives, and Utilitaritanism, JORDAN HOWARD SOBEL According to Casta?eda, the principle that an action is right if it would have better consequences than any of its alternatives is untenable even given plausible restrictions concerning alternatives and value. I argue that though he does not establish this thesis it is nevertheless correct. A demonstration is supplied that capitalizes upon the possibility of doing other than by choice actions that are open to choice. For this demonstra tion the value of an action-proposition is taken to be a probability-weighted average of the ways it could come true. In conclusion, modifications that perhaps render the principle tenable are sketched. For example, rather than applying the "test of utility" to actions open to choice, one might apply it to the choices of these actions. The Commitment Fallacy, LES HOLBOROW I argue against the general theory developed by J. R. Searle in Speech Acts concerning the way in which we commit ourselves by perform ing a speech act. It is shown that Searle's analysis of the relevant speech acts does not accommodate several clear cases of insincere promising and stating, and commits him to an unacceptable derivation of an "ought" from an "is" in the case of stating as well as promising. A reformulation of Searle's rules in terms of the concept of being obliged in the eyes of others both accommodates the counter-examples and removes the un acceptable implications. A Critical Examination of Russell's View of Facts, KEITH HALBASCH In Philosophy of Logical Atomism, Russell argued that negative and general facts were required for an adequate account of truth. In my paper these arguments are explicated and then criticized. Russell's argu ments for negative facts are all rejected, and it is shown that it is con sistent with his basic position to account for the truth or falsity of negative sentences on the basis of positive facts alone. It is further shown that by a novel application of recent, but now standard, techniques in model theoretic semantics it is also possible to account for the truth-value of quantified sentences in terms of atomic facts alone. Intentionality and Possible Facts, RICHARD E. AQUILA Some philosophers, e.g., Bergmann, construe judgment as a relation between mental acts and facts. This requires merely possible facts in the case of mistaken judgment. I discuss the conditions upon any dis tinction between actual and merely possible facts which is compatible</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 593 with an account of intentionality as a relation to facts. One condition of this compatibility is that we be able to distinguish the modes in which a fact exists from modes of connection among the entities involved in that fact. But this distinction is impossible so long as facts are construed, as Bergmann does construe them, as complex entities which literally contain the entities which are involved in them. Massey on Tense and Special Relativity, DOUGLAS LACKEY Certain philosophers have argued that some of the theorems of standard Prior-style tense logics are incompatible with the Special Theory of Relativity. It is argued with respect to one particularly obstrusive example that the incompatibility disappears when a sufficiently a-meta physical interpretation is given to the logical connectives. Some comment on other points in the interpretation of tense logic is provided. An Approach to Intensional Analysis, PAVEL TICHY * The chief features of the approach are the following. 1. The uni verse of individuals is regarded as specified independently of facts and consequently as constant through all possible worlds. 2. Intensions are functions taking possible worlds into extensional entities over the universe. 3. Predicates and descriptive terms refer to intensions rather than to the values of the intensions at the actual world. 4. Ordinary language expres sions are analyzed as involving hidden variables ranging over possible worlds. A simple notational system is proposed. The explanatory power of the approach is demonstrated on an assortment of examples ranging from the de re-de dicto distinction to counterfactual conditionals. Intentionality and Causal Analysis, C. G. PRADO ** In his A Materialist Theory of the Mind (Routledge, 1968) D. M. Armstrong attempts to give a causal analysis of intentionality. In doing so he attempts to reduce that aspect or property of the mental which poses the most worrying obstacle to reductive-materialist analyses of mind. Armstrong's analysis is given in connection with his account of per ception as the acquisition of belief?and ultimately as the acquisition of states apt to produce certain behaviour. The causal analysis of inten tionality also turns on Armstrong's accounts of purposive behaviour and of * Mr. Trichy's article appeared in Vol. V, No. 3: September, 1971. ** Mr. Prado's article appeared in Vol. V, No. 2: May, 1971.</page><page sequence="17">594 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS an objective. It is argued that the account of perception fails because it precludes the differentiation of the sense modalities. It is further argued that the analysis of intentionality fails because it requires the completion of a "causal circuit" involving object perceived, percipient's objectives, and consequent behaviour, but that given his account of an objective, Armstrong cannot in every case unambiguously pick out the percipient's objective, hence is in some cases unable to close his "causal circuit." PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XXI, No. 85: October, 1971 Hume and Shaftesbury on the Self, BEN MIJUSKOVIC The paper criticizes Kemp Smith's thesis that Book I of the Treatise was written after Book II because there are two different conceptions of the self in the two books. Kemp Smith maintains that the self of Book 1 is modelled on atomistic and Newtonian principles; Book II on biological and Hutchesonian ones. The paper argues that: (1) there are not two con flicting conceptions; (2) Hume's view of the self follows Shaftesbury's analyses (not Hutcheson's) and Hume therefore reconciles the "two" posi tions along Shaftesburean lines; and (3) consequently no conclusion regarding the dates of Books I and II can be drawn on the grounds of the self., Hume, like Shaftesbury: (a) attacks the rationalists' principle of a simple and identical idea of the self; (b) assumes we can reflect on our own awarenesses; and (c) insists that our selves possess the same sort of identity attributable to plants and commonwealths. The Political Ideal of Privacy, H. J. McCLOSKEY Privacy is recognized as a value in liberal thought today and even more widely. This paper considers the nature and sphere of privacy, the grounds upon which it is to be demanded and defended, and how the dictates of privacy may collide with those of other values. It is argued that all and every aspect of one's being may be within or without the sphere of privacy, that it depends in a large measure on whether one has by one's actions conferred the right to know on others. The relevance of socially created feelings of outrage, hurt, shame and humiliation to privacy, and the difficulty due to social relativity here of satisfactorily explaining and defining this relevance is noted. Arguments for privacy from the utility of respecting this right, and from what is required by the duty to respect persons, are discussed.</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 595 Vol. XXII, No. 86: January, 1972 The Uniqueness and Reproducibility of a Work of Art: A Critique of Good man's Theory, ANTHONY RALLS Aesthetic Reasons for Acting, A. H. LESSER Other People's Experiences, LLOYD FIELDS Variations on Force and Vivacity in Hume, TRUDY GOVIER Hume's use of such terms as "vivid," "vivacious," "forceful," "strong," and "solid" in the context of impressions and ideas has long seemed peculiar to students of his philosophy. The author maintains that it is helpful to recognize the difference between the forcefulness of an idea and its vividness. The forcefulness of an idea is its influence upon other ideas; its vividness is its clarity and amount of detail. This distinction, although not explicitly adopted by Hume himself, could be adopted in order to improve upon his method of differentiating impressions from ideas, memory from imagination, and belief from conception. A further revision of the Humean position, called item-relativization, avoids some of the more obvious counter-examples to Hume's original formulation. It is also argued that Hume is entitled to regard such terms as "forceful" and "vivid" as primarily applicable to impressions and ideas, and derivatively applicable to external objects. The discussion as whole should serve to remove the suspicion that Hume has stated some of his most basic epistemological distinctions in metaphors which he can neither justify nor explicate. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXX, No. 3: July, 1971 Spinoza's Theory of Ideas, DAISIE RADNER The theory of ideas in Part II of the Ethics is considered in light of problems arising from Cartesian representationalism. I explain what it means in Spinoza's system for ideas to represent and how the adequacy of ideas provides a guarantee of their truth. I distinguish between the object of an idea and what the idea represents, and analyse the relation between the idea and what it represents in terms of the resemblance of the thing represented to the object of the idea. Adequacy and truth are both taken to refer to the relation between ideas and what they represent. A true idea of a thing represents it as it really is. Adequate ideas are true, since they represent their objects. My interpretation is used to overcome such objec tions as "idea" is ambiguous in Spinoza's system and ideas cannot be inadequate in us and adequate in God.</page><page sequence="19">596 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Perceptual Knowledge, JOHN L. POLLOCK The traditional theories of perceptual knowledge are surveyed and rejected. It is then argued that the correct explanation of perceptual knowl edge is that the way in which we are appeared to provide us with prima facie reasons for perceptual judgments. These are reasons that are simul taneously "logical" in the sense that they arise directly from the meaning of the concepts, and defeasible. It is maintained that the concepts of perceptual attributes are "ostensive" concepts that cannot be explained in terms of their truth conditions. Their content is determined by what would count as a good reason for ascribing them to something. This is what makes the above prima facie reasons possible. The paper closes with what purports to be a demonstration that some kinds of statements about the way in which we are appeared to are incorrigible. Utilitarianism and the Wrongness of Killing, RICHARD G. HENSON Whether hedonistic utilitarianism takes pleasure and pain or happi ness and unhappiness as the determinants of Tightness and wrongness (I argue) it is incapable of accounting for the wrongness of killing people. I propose a precise statement of hedonistic act-utilitarianism, based on a metric employing hedons (algebraic units of instantaneous levels of pleasure/pain or happiness/unhappiness) and hedon-hours (quantities of pleasure/pain or happiness/unhappiness, measuring a person's being ?t a given hedonic level through a period of time). Surveying the relevant sources of negative hedon-hours, I argue that causing a person's death often fails to yield a decisive negative verdict on killings which we should generally agree to be clearly wrong. Rule utilitarianism fares better, but raises problems of its own. Three Platonic Analogies, ROBERT J. FOGELIN PHILOSOPHY Vol. XLVII, No. 179: January, 1972 Language, Meaning and God, D. M. MACKAY (1) Examines the biological function of communication, arguing that mechanistic analysis does not "debunk" but suggests more penetrating criteria of meaningfulness. The main linking notion is the "conditional readiness" of the recipient to reckon with his world, which can have a direct correlate in terms of the organizing system of his brain. (2) Notes</page><page sequence="20">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 597 distinctions between meaningful, communicative, and relevant utterances, and opposes the idea that invulnerability-to-test is a sufficient criterion of cognitive meaninglessness. Conceptual blind spots and other barriers to communication are discussed. (3) Applies the analysis to talk about God as "One to be reckoned with," concluding that van Buren and others have no justification for abandoning the "cognitive approach." Draws parallels with the semantics of fundamental physics and of talk about persons, where activity-words stand up best to analysis, and "to be reckoned with" better than "to exist." Truth and the "Religious Language-game," PATRICK SHERRY Taking two new books by D. Z. Phillips as its starting-point, this article considers some recent attempts to apply Wittgenstein's later philos ophy to religious issues, concentrating particularly on their treatment of the question of religious truth. After examining N. Malcolm's "this lan guage-game is played" move, the author goes on to discuss problems con cerning the "autonomy" of religious language and the justification of religious beliefs. It is argued that the views of Phillips and others about the nature of religious truth are both theologically unorthodox and philo sophically unsound, and that they fail to deal with the difficulty that different religions and sects have mutually incompatible beliefs. The article concludes with some suggestions about how a better Wittgensteinian philosophy of religion might be developed: more attention should be paid to understanding religious concept formation, rather than to arguing that religion has a special kind of truth. Games, Families, The Public and Religion, REV. F. GERALD DOWNING Utilitarianism and the Morality of Killing, R. STEPHEN TALMAGE PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENO LOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXXII, No. 2: December, 1971 The Problem of Robot Consciousness, DWIGHT VAN DE VATE, JR. Can we humans make a conscious machine, a machine with the self awareness each of us has? In the literature devoted to this problem, the conscious machine is usually thought of as something produced the way other machines are produced, namely by a solitary inventor or a laboratory team. If one holds as I do, however, that conscious flesh and bone persons are produced by society, that is, by the socialization process, then it becomes interesting to ask whether society could make conscious persons out of gears, wires, and transistors. The three sections of the article are entitled "The Conscious Machine as a Collective Achievement," "The First-Person Structure Problem," and "Structure and Control: The Third-Person Prob lems."</page><page sequence="21">598 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Logical Impossibility, SOLOMON E. LEVY Factual Necessity and the Libertarian, THEODORE GULESERIAN The work performed by the notion of factual necessity in the libertarian's position is precisely described. A portion of a formal system of factual necessity is presented wherein the concept of factual necessity appears as a primitive modal operator. The partial system (or charac terization) includes a special form of the following controversial rule of inference: from, it is contingently true that p and it is factually necessary that if p then q, to infer that it is factually necessary that q. The concept of factual necessity as thus characterized is defended from several objec tions, including the standard charge of confusion with the concept of logical necessity or logical inference. Bruce Aune's treatment of factual necessity, which leads him to conclude that the concept is useless, is shown to be fundamentally defective. The upshot is that regarding factual neces sity the libertarian can clear himself of the popular charge of "conceptual confusion." Some Deontological Expressions, CARL WELLMAN The thesis of this article is that all deontological expressions have the same kind of meaning, critical meaning, and that what distinguishes the meanings of different deontological expressions or of different senses of the same expression is the different critical claims they make. After a brief description of the nature of critical meaning, the various senses of "right," "wrong," "ought," "obligation," and "duty" are defined. The meaning of modifiers such as "moral'' or "legal" when applied to duties or obligations is also analyzed in terms of critical meaning. It is claimed that this paper constitutes a test case that partially confirms the theory of the nature of judgments of obligation originally proposed in The Language of Ethics. Ontological Cryptophobia, C. MASON MEYERS It is argued that reaction to a seemingly inflated ontology often results in unwarranted ontological parsimony. Quine 's rejection of existent possi bilities in "On What There Is" is countered by showing each of his objec tions answerable without unnecessary or irrational reification. In partic ular, reasons are given why possibility cannot be regarded as something "merely mental." The concept of reality is examined in order to determine in what sense a possibility can be real in a philosophically interesting way. This sense is shown to be that in which x can be said to be real (1) only if "x has some predicate P" is logically independent of "Someone believes x has P" and (2) only if there is no obvious way in which x is a construct. Requirement (2) is then defended against the criticism that it disregards the question of ontological ultimacy.</page><page sequence="22">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 599 Sum is a Logical Consequence of Cogito, RONALD SUTER Hintikka ("Cogito, Ergo Sum: Inference or Performance?") wishes to reject (1) B(a)-&gt;(Ex) (x = a), pointing out that it would cease to be provable in quantification theory if logicians dropped the dubious assump tion that (2) all the singular terms with which we have to deal designate some actually existing individual. He also argues for the falsity of (3) thinking entails existence. Williams (The Certainty of the Cogito) contends that Descartes inferred "I exist" from "I think" using (4) "B(a)" presupposes that (Ex) (x = a) as his principle of inference. In this paper, the author shows why (3) should be affirmed and (1), (2), and (4) rejected. While he thus agrees with Hintikka and Williams that appeal to our lower functional calculi fails to explain the necessity of the connection between cogito and sum, he offers an alternative account of why sum is nevertheless a logical consequence of cogito. RATIO Vol. XIII, No. 2: December, 1971 The Hohfeldian Jurai Opposite, PHILIP MULLOCK Hohfeld's theory of fundamental legal conceptions seeks to explicate the various senses of "a legal right" in terms of their logical interrelations of correlative (logical equivalent) and opposition (contradiction). A. R. Anderson argued in "Logic, Norms and Roles," Ratio, vol. 4, p. 36 (1962) that a) Hohfeld's correlatives were not in all cases logical equivalents, and b) Hohfeld's concept of opposition was not simply nega tion. On the basis of a careful examination of Hohfeld's writings it is argued, contra Anderson, that Hohfeld's theory is in fact an informal legal precursor of modern deontic logic and is consistent with the square of opposition for deontic modalities. The essence of Hohfeld's theory is that if a is a jurai relation (Right, Privilege, Power, Immunity, etc.) and it is true that a then we can point to its correlative which is also the case and to its opposite which is not the case.</page></plain_text>
