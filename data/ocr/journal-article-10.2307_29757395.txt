<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Critical Review of Rock Art Studies in Saudi Arabia by Majeed Khan As a result of the Comprehensive Archaeological Survey Program in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducted under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities and Museums, a large number of rock art sites are recorded. Brief reports on these sites have been published in Atlal, the Journal of Saudi Arabian Archaeology; except for the work of Anati (1968, 1972, 1974), little has been published on the rock art of Saudi Arabia. Articles have been published on Hanakiya (Courtenay-Thomson 1975), and on the rock art of Arabia (Zarins 1980, 1982, 1985), using the same dating and analytical scheme which Anati devised for the Central Arabian rock art (1968, 1972, 1974) (*). In the late 1960's and early 1970's, when archaeological investigations started on a large scale in the more remote areas of Saudi Arabia, archaeologists either did not take account of rock art sites, or these were poorly recorded. Often, only those sites that were easily accessible or strikingly depicted, were recorded. Sometimes, when rock carvings and inscriptions were associated, all too often the epigraphists ignored the petroglyphs. Thus rock art long remained in obscurity. In such a situation Anati's pioneering work (1968, 1974) on the rock art of central Arabia was warmly applauded by the archaeologists and rock art students. Material from other regions of Arabia was also dated and classified with reference to Anati's work (e.g. Zarins 1981, 1982). Even when rock art studies started on a larger scale in Saudi Arabia and reports were published in Atlal (1985-1992), an even more recent article of Michael Jung (1991b) still depended on Zarin's old work and Anati's dating and classification. Moreover, the rock art of North Yemen has been interpreted and dated in relation to Anati's work in Arabia. More recent rock art and epigraphic surveys of the central and southern parts of Saudi Arabia (Kabawi, Khan &amp; Zahrani 1990) reveal that Anati's dating, analysis and interpretations are to be re-evaluated and his studies reviewed in the light of new evidence. It is interesting to note that Anati did not visit the sites himself, and his studies were wholly based on the photographs supplied to him by the Philby-Ryckmans-Lippens expedition of 1951-52. Anati's method was to divide the rock art of Central Arabia into the following highly generalized and flexible periods: Islamic after A.D. 622 Literate A.D. 650-1000 Late Hunting and Pastoral 500-1,200 B.C Middle Hunting and Pastoral I 1,000-2,000 B.C. Middle Hunting and Pastoral II 2,000-3,000 B.C. (*) A detailed critical account on Anati's books by this author is being published in Atlal, 14 (in press). [1] 427</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 - Rock-carvings reproduced from Anati's books on Central Arabia: 1-6. Rock K-59 (Anati 1974: 96); 7. Dhathami style (Anati 1974: 47); 8. Mahash style (Anati 1972: 150). (Anati 1968: 160). Anati recognized 35 styles and accommodated them in the above classification. However, his classification of styles appears ambiguous. It is heavily dependent upon the shape and outlines of figures, the size, the characteristics of 'pecking' to produce the figures, rather than the decoration or modification of traits, an approach that is both uncertain and equivocal. Thus to distinguish the difference on the basis of 'elegant and generalized shape' (his definition for Najd Hair Style); and 'rather elegant animal figures with body entirely or partially pecked' (his definition for Samma Style) is practically impossible. Simple morphological generalizations are inadequate. Anati's dating of central Arabian rock art is based on stylization but he does not give any reason for including one style in the Hunting and Pastoral II and another in Hunting and Pastoral III phase. We have no idea on what evidence his dating is based. Neither does he make any attempt to correlate his dating with the archaeology of the region. Although in some cases his classification of phases is based upon superimpositions or difference in patina, we still do not know how he classified rock art into different chronological phases; for example, the Preliterate Hunters and Pastoralists period has been further subdivided into Late, Middle, I, II, and III but provides no evidence in support of his suggested phases and their dating. The dubiousness of classification and dating remains constant throughout his books and it is never clarified on what basis the Middle Hunting Pastoral III is considered the oldest and how he has dated this or other sub-phases. According to Anati 'each style has its own figurative repertoire. Each style has its own figurative approach, its approach to scenes and compositions'. He further adds, 'cultural Middle Hunting and Pastoral III Early Hunting and Pastoral Early Hunters 3,000-4,000 B.C. 4,000-6,000 B.C. before 6,000 B.C 428 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 - Rock-carvings reproduced from Anati's books on Central Arabia: 1-2. Long-haired style female; 3. Islamic; 4. Literate; 5. Pre-literate. differences shown from different styles seem to indicate that, in many cases, stylistic differences may represent the presence of different cultural human groups' (1972: 30). But he does not classify figures in similar style according to his own definition. An example of the confusion generated is that some female representations which show common traits and are depicted in identical style, are nevertheless differently dated. One of them (Fig. 2.1) is included in the 'Long Haired People Style' (1200-500 B.C.); the other (Fig. 2.3) is included in the Islamic Period' (after A.D. 622). This failure to recognize and classify each style separately is a major shortcoming of Anati's work. For example, figures depicted on rock K-59 (Fig. 1) are classified as Dhathami Style. If we look at the definition of Anati for Dhathami Style, we will find that none of the figures on this rock fit the definition that he established for the Dhathami Style, which according to him 'is characterized by stylised small size animals, the shape of the body being rather neglected and pecked mainly in the front part. Some of the oxen appear as bulls, most of the animals are in motion posture. They give the impression of large herds. Anthropomorphic figures are hybrid and have horns, a fact which may indicate the presence of a particular consideration for the animal' (1970: 122). When we look at the figures of rock K-59 (Fig. 1), we fail to recognize specific traits of Dhathami Style on them. For example Fig. 1.2 that of an ox has a complete body conflicting with Anati's definition of Dhathami Style. The animal in Fig. 6 is also complete and is depicted in profile; Fig. 1.5 appears to be an unidentified animal which is depicted with fully pecked body; Fig. 1.2 shows V-shaped horns as opposed to the splaying horns of Fig. 1.1. Thus each figure of rock K-59 shows variations in its traits and style, and none of them conform to the definition of Dhathami Style. Furthermore, Fig. 2.3 has similar traits to that of Fig. 2.2. Both are shown with long hair reaching down to the waist, half-raised arms, open palms with outstretched fingers, a triangular torso, small neck and narrow waist. Despite the similarity in traits of these two figures, Anati has dated them differently and has separated them into two different periods ? Fig. 2.2 is included under the 'Long Hair People Style', while Fig. 2.3 is included in the Islamic Period. On the other hand, Fig. 2.5 with all its different traits has been included with Fig. 2.2 in the preliterate period. This does show that Anati sometimes ignored the characteristic features of his own definitions and classified figures into various styles and dated them separately without considering their common or different stylistic traits. [3] 429</page><page sequence="4">1 Fig. 3-1. Animal-headed female figure at Abha, associated with an inscription; 2. Animal-headed female figure dated 5000-1200 B.C., reproduced from Anati's book. All the figures included in Fig. 2 reveal that the representations of the so-called 'mythical females or goddesses' are similar in their basic traits. There are no good grounds for separating them into different styles or phases. They apparently belong to the same style and undoubtedly the same time and cultural period. In vol. 1 (pp. 68-69) Anati included a schematized human figure with an animal-like face. He considered it 'Preliterate' representation, while during my recent visit to the same area I located a similar figure in association with an inscription (Fig. 3) mentioning the name of a pre-Islamic deity 'Azun'. Thus again Anati's dating proved to be erroneous. It is not only Anati's dating and classification of styles which are based on insufficient archaeological or technical grounds ? but his conclusions are also hypothetical. In vol. 4 Anati includes a chapter on 'the analysis of fauna', written by E. Techerno. At one place Techerno writes, 'the apparent similarities between the Dhathami Style and an Indian mode of engraving are of much interest. If the engraving technique is derived from an Indian source, we may speculate that both artistic style and cattle, and perhaps, the entire culture, were introduced via Mesopotamia' (Anati 1974: 240-41). These speculations are based on the location of a single highly stylized cattle representation (Fig. 5.3). Zebu was introduced to Arabia quite late probably during Bronze/Iron Age (Clason 1975: 94-95). Techerno's suggestions that before 8,000 years not only the Zebu but the 'entire culture were introduced via Mesopotamia to Arabia' contradicts Anati's conclusions in which he suggested that the 'Oval Headed people appeared in Central Arabia towards the end of the fourth or at the beginning of the third millennium B.C.' (Anati 1968a: 100). Anati further adds, 'the negroid population seems to have lived happily in their Central Arabian "diaspora" until the end of the second millennium. At this time, some external factor, probably the arrival in the area of more powerful human groups, caused their sudden departure. From then therefore, no traces have been found of their beautiful and characteristic rock pictures' (1964: 181). During my recent visit to Anati's sites I found several Oval Headed People figures superimposed or associated with inscriptions (Fig. 4) thus contradicting the entire dating and classifications as well as the conclusions of Anati's studies. 430 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4 - A rock-art panel at Jebel al-Kaukab, Central Arabia. The 'Oval-Headed People' and the female with long hair are either superimposed on inscriptions or are identical in patina. There are several such rock-art panels at Jebel al-Kaukab and in the Jebel al-Qara area. This evidence invalidates all the dating and interpretation of Anati's 'Oval-Headed People' and 'Females with Long Hair', which, according to Anati, fall between the 4th and the 2nd millennium B.C. Actually they are located either in association with or superimposed on inscriptions. [5] 431</page><page sequence="6">Thus the story of the migration of 'Oval Headed People* appears somewhat unconvincing, as we find the same art style continued until and even after the literate period. Also there is no evidence of attributing the 'Oval Headed People' to the 4th or 3rd millennium B.C. Almost all the human figures are associated with daggers and swords. Also Anati placed some of the female figures with long hair in the Islamic and literate period as well, but he provides no evidence for their appearance in the 5th or 4th millennium B.C. I agree with Jung's dating of Bronze or early Iron Age for the 'Oval Headed People', and the 'Females with Long Hair' could safely be attributed to the Iron Age, as most of these figures are located either in association or superimposed on the inscriptions. Anati's suggestion that the 'Oval Headed People' left the area in the 2nd millennium B.C. is totally absurd. From a total of 27 rocks containing petroglyphs, 23 have been recorded from the area of Jebel Qara (Anati 1968b: 9). A recent visit to the area of Bir Himma, Jebel Qara and Jebel al Kaukab by this author together with the survey team of the Department of Antiquities and Museums revealed hundreds of rock art panels scattered over the area in which the Philby-Ryckman-Lippen Expedition recorded only 23 rocks. Jebel Qara and Jebel Kaukab consist of a range of small hills running parallel to each other north of Himma. Besides the range of Jebel Qara and Jebel Kaukab, there are various other small hills and outcrops scattered in the wadis and in the open plains, on which hundreds of petroglyphs and inscriptions are located. I observed that either the Philby-Ryckman-Lippens Expedition did not record all the available rock art and inscription sites from the area, and that it had been selective in its recordings, or it had not provided all the recorded information and photographs to Anati or perhaps Anati himself worked on some highly selected material. During our survey of Anati's area (Central Arabia as he suggested) we have recorded very frequent depictions of large-sized human representations wearing feathered headdresses and holding spears or spears and shields. They are usually situated on prominent locations usually facing east. Their prominent locations, uniform style and identical traits, possibly suggest that the artists intended to represent a common single personality which could perhaps be a 'deity'. If the artist meant to portray himself, as Anati suggested (1968b: 6), then each figure would be different from the other, both in its outlook and facial features, while this is not the case. Likewise female figures with long hair, triangular torso, narrow waist and half-raised arms are also frequently found throughout the area of Jebel Kaukab and Jebel Qara. These figures are attributed by local bedouins to 'Alia' the famous pre-Islamic deity and ruler of the area. Anati places these figures in his chronology of Late Hunting Pastoral period, dated c. 5000 B.C.-1200 B.C. (1974: 140-41). In a recent paper Michael Jung (1991b) compared the rock art of northern Yemen with that of Central Arabia and criticized the dating of Anati for the Oval Headed People. He has also stressed the dating, classification and interpretation of Zarins (1982) for northern Saudi Arabian rock art. Jung referred to the Comprehensive Archaeological Survey reports of Saudi Arabia and suggested that 'these studies reveal rock pictures with characteristic traits that are surprisingly uniform and common both to Central and to Northern Arabia'. I am surprised by this highly ambitious comparison as there is absolutely no similarity in the rock pictures of Jubbah and Central Arabia either in compositions of contents or stylization. A comparative study of human and cattle figures from Jubbah and Central Arabia reveal that the early phases of Jubbah rock art can safely be attributed to the neolithic period (dated on the basis of stone artifacts found in most of the Jubbah sites and the analysis of Jubbah 432 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 5-1. Male and female figures fromjubbah (Zarin's Jubbah style); 2. Male and female figures from Central Arabia (from Anati's books on Central Arabia); 3. Tracings of a part of 'the Hunter's Palette'. lake sediments, which suggests that it was active c. 7000 to 5000 B.P.) while that of Central Arabia does not go beyond the Bronze Age. The Jubbah cattle are depicted large size, sometimes with very deep pecking and sometimes in low relief (Fig. 5). Only two types of horns are found in the Jubbah area, one with forward projecting horns, probably suggesting a wild species, and the other with backwardly curved horns usually associated with a human figure, perhaps suggesting a domesticated animal (Khan 1933, 1996). In Najran area the cattle are mostly Zebu type with upward rising horns (see above). In a very few cases cattle with small and forward projecting horns are found. They are very small in size and some of them resemble human figures with horns (see Anati 1968). Similarly there is a substantial difference both in style and physical traits of Jubbah human figures and those of the Najran area. t7] 433</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 6-1. Rock-cut cattle figures from South/Central Arabia; 2. Rock-cut cattle figures from Jubbah (Zarin's Jubbah style). Human figures from Jubbah are shown holding either bows and arrows or boomerangs. There are absolutely no spears or shields or daggers depicted with human figures in Jubbah, as Zarins (1982: 26) has mentioned. I have recorded almost every rock-art panel from Jubbah and have never found any shields or spears on human figures. But these are most common in the rock art of the Oval Headed People which are usually associated with long spears, shields and daggers. While facial features are shown on most of the Oval Headed People, Jubbah rock art is totally devoid of facial features. There is also a highly recognizable difference in the female figures of Jubbah and central and southern Arabia (Fig. 6). Again there is an erroneous mention of human stick figures and spears in Jubbah rock art (Jung 1991b: 51). Human stick figures appeared very late (Bronze/Iron Age) in the rock art of Saudi Arabia (Khan 1989). Zarins (1982) and Jung (1991b) have both reached to far-fetched conclusions regarding the similarities in the cultures of north and south Arabian hunting and pastoral societies. Also Anati's claim that the makers of the rock art of central Arabia moved to the north or migrated to Africa via the Sinai Peninsula or crossed the Red Sea at the end of the 2nd or beginning of the 1st millennium B.C. (Anati 1968b: 182) is totally invalid as we have seen that several Oval Headed People figures are superimposed on inscriptions or found in association with them (Fig. 4), thereby suggesting the presence of Oval Headed People in southern Arabia and even further south, in northern Yemen (Jung 1991b), until very late in the historic period. The similarities in the rock art of north Yemen (Jung 1991b) with those of Anati's Oval Headed People and the association of some figures from Safir etc. with the Thamudic inscriptions support my claim that Anati's dating of the rock art of central Arabia is erroneous and invalid. I agree to Jung's suggestion that the rock art of Jubbah is much older (7000-5000 years B.P.) than that of Central Arabia or northern Yemen (Bronze/Iron Age). Also Oval Headed People figures are not found elsewhere north of Najran. This particular cultural 434 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 7 - A sketch-map showing major rock-art sites in Saudi Arabia and the 'Alia Triangle'. group was inhabited in a triangular area from Najran to Abha and further south in North Yemen. Figures of the Oval Headed People do not exist north of Najran or Jebel Qara and Jebel Kaukab ranges. They are found in small numbers in Bisha, Abha and Baha area, that is, in the northwestern highlands and further south in north Yemen. It means that the people who depicted the Oval Headed People did not cross the 'Alia Triangle' (my attribution), and their culture was mostly limited to this Triangle (Fig. 7). The total absence of Oval Headed People in the rock art of Hejaz, Najed and northern Saudi Arabia prove that Anati's hypothetical suggestion of migration is also invalid. Zarin's (1982) relative dating of Jubbah rock art as Chalcolithic based on stylistic similarities with the figures of The Hunters Palette' (Fig. 8) is also erroneous, as it is based on assumptions and not on reality. Neither the bows and arrows nor the dress and style of palette figures show any similarity with Jubbah figures (Fig. 6). The long spears, the dress and the bows shown in the palette figures have absolutely no resemblance with Jubbah's simple bow and arrows. Furthermore, in the palette, the human figures are shown holding spears which are totally absent in the rock art of Jubbah. Although during the comprehensive rock art and epigraphic survey of central and southern Saudi Arabia hundreds of rock-art sites were located, unfortunately no cultural material was found near or around those sites, which created a problem of dating. However, in most of [9] 435</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 8 - 'The Hunter's Palette' (after Frankfort 1951: pi. XIV). the cases Oval Headed People figures are found superimposed or in association with certain inscriptions. The patina difference of these inscriptions with the associated rock art does not suggest a long-time period. Perhaps the Oval Headed People rock art was depicted in the 1st millennium B.C. and continued until the literate period. There is no evidence to prove Anati's dating of 4th millennium B.C. for the beginning of this art. The greater concentration of Oval Headed People rock-art sites in the Najran and Bisha area of Saudi Arabia and their further location in Abha and Dhahran al Janub suggest that this particular art was first adopted on a large scale in southern Saudi Arabia and the artists who used the same art inhabited further away in north Yemen. Merely on the basis of rock art it is not possible to suggest where these people came from. They might have developed their own art, which later became popular in the area on a large scale. However, in the entire Saudi Arabia from Jubbah to Najran (about 2000 km) this particular art style does not exist, which suggests a local evolution, development and adoption. I therefore do not agree with Jung's suggestion that the Jubbah and Oval Headed People Style belong to one common culture. The total lack of any stylistic similarities in the human and cattle figures of Jubbah and Southern Arabia and Yemen rock art (Fig. 6) and the limitation of the Oval Headed People and Females with Long Hair within the 'Alia Triangle' of Najran, Baha and Abha in the southwest and the Safir range of North Yemen, clearly indicate artistic and cultural differences in the population of northern and southern Arabia. While in the north, male figures dominate rock-art assemblages, in the south female figures are most common. Almost all the deities represented in the rock art of northern Arabia are male, whereas most of the deities shown in the rock art of Southern/Central Arabia are female. The northern society was male dominated while the culture of the Oval Headed People shows that women occupied a more prominent place in society. The rock art of northern Saudi Arabia shows a variety of art styles which have been chronologically classified by the present author. The Bronze and Iron Age rock art of the north consist of usually outlined or stick human and animal figures while in the south we find 'Oval Headed People' and 'Long Haired Females', which are usually associated with inscriptions. Thus there are sharp stylistic and contextual differences in the art of northern and southern Saudi Arabia which could be taken as representing two different cultural entities. 436 [10]</page><page sequence="11">REFERENCES Anati, E.
