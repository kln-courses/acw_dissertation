<plain_text><page sequence="1">French Circus Posters Ségolène Le Men Circus posters are commonly referred to as an autonomous genre among posters, although they ought to be considered simply as a subdivision within the general category of posters connected with the performing arts, which themselves belong to the broad field of cultural posters. Circus posters are immediately recognizable as such: brightly col- oured, they carry a conventional set of images related to the language of the circus show, as it is found in the circus programme. National traditions had merged into the international circus culture of the 'travelling people'1 by the end of the nineteenth century, when fair gatherings,2 which belonged to traditional culture, gave way to the modern and fashionable show of the circus. The 1 88os was a turn- ing point, when the traditional circus poster found broader applications : many permanent circuses were built in Paris, for which posters were commis- sioned, and the genre was extended to other places This article, which was suggested to me by Henri Zerner, is based on research derived from a 'dossier' show, 'L'Affiche et le cirque', held at the Musée d'Orsay (April-July 1991). Publica- tions on this topic include various exhibition catalogues, in addi- tion to the extensive literature devoted to the history of the circus (see the bibliography given by H. Thétard in La Merveilleuse Histoire du cirque , Paris 1978); Le Cirque , Paris, Musée des Arts Décoratifs, 1974 (typed list) ; and Le Cirque français Paris, Musée de la Publicité, 1981 (for the large Musée de la Publicité collec- tion).

Franconi frères 1813, woodcut, 450 x 605 mm (Paris, Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires) . where circus performances were given, like the hip- podromes and the cafés-concerts; in the Ginger- bread Fair, located in Place de la Nation, in the east of Paris, posters started to replace the paintings used in the advertising parade, and soon took the place of the parade itself.3 At the same time, new oppor- tunities became available for new developments in the art of the poster and, under Chéreťs impetus, a new style emerged that was influential in the birth of Art Nouveau : this confrontation between tradi- tion and modernity, low and high art, is part of the fascination raised by circus posters. The history of circus posters can be divided - as is the case for all posters - in two main periods : the black and white period and the colour period, each dependent on the techniques available at the time. The circus began in the eighteenth century as a show based on horse exercises ; it was imported into France from England by Astley in 1 783, who set up the first permanent circus in Paris, in the Faubourg du Tem- ple. During the first half of the nineteenth century the Franconi family, a dynasty established by a legendary founder during the era of the French Revolution and the Empire, settled in Astley's circus following his exile, until a circus was built in 1839 by the architect Hittorff in the Carré Marigny : this Cirque des Champs Elysées was the birthplace of the Romantic circus.4 Beside the shows, the circus was a fashionable place where riding lessons were given to the aristocracy and the Court. 3. In Les Frères £emganno , his novel published in Paris in 1879, Edmond de Goncourt expressly stated the link between the parade and the circus poster : 'Alors le pitre, aux deux côtés de la porte d'entrée, posait une affiche qui servait pour toute la saison, une affiche menteuse où le directeur donnait une idée de l'art à la fois savant et bonhomme de ses réclames, de sa littérature, de son latin même . . .

Grandville made two drawings of it : one in his youthful Neo- classical style, and the other in his daring late style, a breath- taking bird's-eye view made as a preparatory drawing for the illustration of a chapter of his last work, Un Autre Monde (Paris, 1 844) ; both drawings, which belong to the Guiaud album in the Carnavalet museum collection in Paris, are reproduced in the catalogue Grandville au musée Carnavalet , Paris, Paris- musées, 1987 ; Guiaud was a pompier painter of the time, who had been the friend of Grandville in his youth ; it is quite likely that Guiaud knew Chéret and showed him his admirable album of Grandville's drawings.</page><page sequence="3">FRENCH CIRCUS POSTERS 365 203. Rouchon, ' Hippodrome" , 1858, woodcut, 1,200 x830 mm (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra).</page><page sequence="4">366 FRENCH CIRCUS POSTERS Announcements for the Astley and Franconi shows were given in various ways, of which posters was one ; these early posters are very rare,5 and may be considered as the incunabula of the art of the illus- trated poster. One must remember that in France posters in black typography on white paper were a royal monopoly for official notices: there were dif- ferent ways for issuing posters privately, one of which was the use of colour paper (each theatre in Paris had its own colour) . The use of images was another way to issue private posters, and this became the pre- ferred avenue of the circus. Astley posters were long and narrow, and divided in two : the upper part was pictorial, the lower tex- tual. A combination of woodcut medallions was above a long typographical text, where the size of font determined the sequence of reading. Special problems arose with circus posters, which needed to present large images that could be seen from afar and which had to be printed in large runs; also, while the same images could be used over and again, the text had to be changed in language (French or English) and in content, according to different pro- grammes, new schedules and places. These problems became even more acute when wood-engraving sup- planted the use of woodcuts: vignettes were more appropriate for the page of a book than for the size of mural posters, although they permitted large print runs. In the case of popular broadsheets and wall- papers similar problems were solved by splitting up the pictorial field into smaller areas, where the vignettes were either juxtaposed or coordinated within some kind of framing device. In wallpapers, the ornate frame provided a pattern that could be repeated along the roll of paper. In the Astley poster of 1786, Plus de cent tours différens (fig. 201), vignettes are set in medallions linked together in two groups by different decorative motifs: wreaths, crowns, grotesque faces and ribbons, comparable to phylac- teries used as a field for mottoes.6 Formally, this over- all pattern refers back to both wallpaper design and to fair paintings, although it also functions as a trademark, identifying Astley by his emblem - the horse and rider linked to the motto vide et crede. Two rectangular blocks were used, and it is quite likely that silhouette end-grain vignettes (probably not engraved with the burin)7 were fitted into the medal- lions. This system of using medallions divided the field of the poster into smaller areas, which meant that a broken piece could be more easily replaced; it also introduced a kind of narrative rotation from one vignette to the next, which led the reader to interpret the whole picture as a circular strip that referred to the successive steps of the programme, as it was described in the lower, textual, part of the poster. It would, however, be wrong to expect in this early example a one-to-one literal illustration, as this kind of poster did not yet belong to the system of literate book illustration but still to the 'popular' culture of broadsheet imagery, which it shared with chapbook vignettes and shop signs: in these, figurative motifs have a generic significance that can be compared to pictograms, or noun-pictures, where they derive their meaning from either the content or from the oral explanation of the peddlar or commentator, who shows one vignette after the other to the audience. This oral comment is transposed into print in the lower part, which occupies one third of the poster: font size, variations from capital letters to lower-case letters and from roman to italic char- acters allow a subtle gradation of literacy, which relates to the learning of reading in the petites écoles of the Ancien Régime.8 At that time many people remained semi-literate, mastering spelling only in capital letters; in the rural communities there were often one or two people who acted as cultural mediators, as they were able to read the texts of chap- books and posters to the community, thereby orally transmitting a written culture to their audience. This type of audience was, on the other hand, alert to the pictorial part of these printed objects, whether 5. Some are recorded in the collections of the Musée des Arts et Traditions Populaires in Paris (but not in the Musée de la Publicité, which reflects the tastes of the first collectors of posters, the affichomanes of the turn of the century) ; there are also examples in private collections in Germany. 6. These mottoes were written in simple Latin: 'vide et crede' which, being an international language, was appropriate for itinerant circus troupes. 7. As Robert Blachon has recently reminded us in the Nouvelles de l'estampe , Spring, 1991, about early Armenian end-wood engravings, one must distinguish two stages in the invention of wood engraving : the use of the end-grain block, and the use of the burin as the tool for engraving it. 8. According to the price paid and to the length of schooling, it was possible to gain access to a reasonable standard of literacy competence, at a time when reading was taught to the poor over a seven-year period as a companion study to catechism, which remained the major aim of the Christian Schools Brotherhood (Frères des Ecoles chrétiennes). Initial instruction was devoted to the ABC in Roman capital letters, then one learned to read the ABC in Roman lower-case, then in italic and other types. This was followed by syllables, words from one to four syllables and, finally, texts.</page><page sequence="5">FRENCH CIRCUS POSTERS 367 204.

A comparison between French and English popular printed culture shows that the pictorial mode was more developed in England - for instance in chapbooks - than it was in the French bibliothèque bleue. The same goes for pos- ters: while French official notices (avis) were based on a written version of the oral message and exposed the quasi-magical presence of a text to the illiterate,9 who had to avail themselves of cultural inter- mediaries, English and German posters were not constrained by regulations on their design and made greater use of a mixture of woodcut imagery and text. This perhaps had something to do with the dif- ferent levels of literacy that existed in Protestant and Catholic countries. The Astley poster implies two levels of reading competence, one for the capital letters spread all over the field (the title at top, some areas of the text in the lower part and in the phylactery inscriptions), and the other for the further text in the lower part. This duality parallels that of the typefaces used for texts and titles of books. If indeed this is true for early posters,10 the text in the lower part may be under- stood as an equivalent to the detailed analytical sub- title that functioned as a kind of summary in eighteenth-century books ; as a whole, the poster also looks like an enlarged emblem, where the image is placed between title and text, which provides its clues. Circus shows admitted a socially mixed audience, and circus posters therefore reflected this by introducing a complex visual system that drew upon different cultures, from popular culture (oral, semi-literate or literate) to book-culture, which recognized the allusions to title-pages and emblem books. This is an important feature, and remains a major issue in the whole history of posters, con- sidered, as this is, as a canal for the merging of dif- ferent cultures and a sign for the birth of the civilisation of mass-media - what American scholars call the 'Popular Culture'. Whereas the Astley poster appears as a French equivalent of the English version produced for the same company (possibly with the same woodblocks), and was conceived in a way that is close to the early circus posters in Germany and England,11 the Franconi poster Aujourd'hui, par permission . . . Cirque de MM. Franconi frères . . . (fig. 202) refers back to an autochthonous tradition used, for instance, by Papillon in his famous theatre posters : the image is relegated to the edges of the poster, horizontal in format. This ornate frame is comparable to that found in some tapestries and book pages, where tall blocks are fitted together to form the four edges of the 'frame', and where the text is exposed in the centre of the sheet. The Franconi poster also derives from the kind of panel that was posted on the door of the circus, to announce the coming show. The official approval of the show is stressed in different ways: the Napoleonic eagle tops the whole composition (in the place occupied by the dove in sacred contexts) and the first line of the text refers to the permission given by the mayor; finally, in a subtle but effective way, the typography uses the Didot character, which was used for official texts, and the poster tries to look like an official notice, printed in black on white paper without an image inside the main field. Nevertheless, the Franconi poster follows the same combination of decorative and figurative motifs in the imagery - in which silhouette vignettes are fitted within a geometrically framed pattern - and a sim- ilar dual level of reading as is found in the Astley poster. As for the latter, it includes the date and loca- tion of the show (Saturday, 4 September 1813, under the new market-hall), yet the name of the town is not given. Bold type in the capital letters adds expressivity to the well-controlled hierarchy of char- acter sizes, in a way that foreshadows the Romantic use of expressive typography in titles and advertis- ing. The show is, by this date, already varied and well-structured : the text of the poster describes the sequence of events and thus plays the rôle of a pro- gramme: equestrian exercises (grandes manoeuvres de cavalerie ), a pantomime (la scène des frères meuniers ), dances (le menuet et la contre-danse) and, last but not least, the performance by a marvellous animal, the 'DEER, named Coco, seven years old and embel- lished with antlers' (CERF, dit Coco, âgé de sept ans et orné de son bois) . The whole typographical composition culminates in the word cerf very deliberately, for it not only refers to the well-known deer that belonged to the Franconis, but also to an animal famous in tradi- 9.

The antlers of the deer were used in jokes about cuckolds,12 and relate to a well-known gesture (faire les cornes).13 Besides this comic aspect, which makes the deer look like a kind of animal clown and the circus show like a charivari ,14 the deer belonged to the vocabulary of contemporary French animal ABCs, and the shape of this word as it is spel- led in capital letters was familiar to children. On a more serious note, the deer was also linked to the Christian culture of the legenda aurea through the story of St Hubert, which had its lay counterpart in Geneviève de Brabant (a chapbook tale taken up by puppet theatres,15 and apparently related to Protes- tant culture16 ) . For all these reasons, the simple large spelling in bold type of the noun 'deer' plays the rôle of an image within the text of the poster, as it immediately evokes a visual response in the minds of a wide range of spectators. It is not surprising, however, that the deer does not appear on the illus- trated edges of the poster, for it does not belong to the conventional iconography of circus posters. Within the space of 30 years early circus posters - from Astley to Franconi - had defined a standard iconography based on equestrian themes, which included scenes that involved equestrian dancers, acrobatic clowns, and 'Mr Loyal5 with his long whip ; the text was conceived as a summary of the show, and included place, time and the cost of the 1 1 .

The use of gestures, of course, forms part of the farcical basis for the comic circus. 14. The charivari was the noisy mockery raised in rural communi- ties against cuckolded husbands or quarrelsome couples. 1 5.

Both these posters also stressed the name of the circus director, which was used as a com- mercial hallmark. Many changes derived from the shift to techniques other than woodcut, which finally led to colour lithography, the medium employed by the end of the nineteenth century. Chéret was a major figure in the advent of colour lithography in France, although the need for colour and large pic- tures were earlier met by other techniques. In the 1840s the artist and printer Rouchon inven- ted the modern formula of the outdoor, illustrated, large-size colour poster : hitherto, illustrated posters either involved woodcut vignettes or black and white lithography to advertise romantic illustrated books.17 These posters derived pictorially from the books they announced : in the lithographic type they reproduced in an enlarged form a title-page or fron- tispiece, while, in the vignette type, they showed samples of the illustrations of the book that was being announced. They were meant to be placed inside the glass of the bookshop door, or inside the shop. Rouchon worked mainly for the 4 magasins de nouveautés ' - shops selling fashionable goods, espe- cially clothes - but in 1846 he also made the first ¡ feuilleton ' poster for Le Fils du diable by Paul Féval, and in 1 858 produced a poster for the Hippodrome, which gave new life to the tradition of circus posters (fig. 203).18 The hippodrome was a large oval-shaped amphi- theatre in which horse races as well as shows inspired by the circus tradition took place. As horses were then a major feature of everyday life, equestrian attractions became very popular and hippodromes became part of the Parisian social scene. During the second half of the century, the Hippodrome du Pont de l'Alma followed a very dynamic advertising policy : in his poster for it, Rouchon gave not only his address (10, rue Bréda) - as printers were obliged by the law to do - but also included imp . breveté ; imp was the abbreviation for imprimeur (printer), while breveté may be understood in two ways : that he was a registered printer and that he was a printer who held a brevet , a patent that was jealously guarded. His invention was a colour-printing process for pos- ters, developed from one used by wallpaper printers,1 9 who applied colour woodblocks to the paper. This technique recalled the traditional way for colouring popular imagery and playing cards by using stencils. The result was a clearly defined image made of jux- taposed areas of colour and of flattened shapes, which needed to be very synthetic and expressive. The technique was well suited to poster imagery, and Rouchon mastered it wonderfully : his Hippodrome of 1858 (fig. 203) is centred on a large picture, presen- ted as an expanded vignette, in which galloping hor- ses and their riders recall the treatment of this motif in popular circus imagery, inspired by the Hip- podrome and the Franconi show (figs. 204 and 205). 20 But the subject showed a romantic elope- ment, related to the pantomime show given* at the time in the Hippodrome, which involved a Crusader and a Moor riding away with a woman in oriental dress. Medieval European history and orientalism were thus combined with the equestrian theme, with possible references to the magical world of the Thousand and One Nights' Entertainments. Cross- cultural, geographical and historical connotations belonged not only to the Romantic bric à brae , in time they also became part of the formula of large audience shows, down to Hollywood movies.21 The picture gives a strange and contradictory effect of immobility and animation: the riders' bodies stress static verticals and the full-face Crusader gazing at the spectator gives an impression of stillness, while the floating veil of the woman and the legs of the galloping horses suggest speed and movement. This 'vignette', placed between lines of text, is treated in a very different way than the text of the early 'logo- centric' circus posters : here the text not only embra- ces the image, setting for it a base and a top, but also becomes part of it, as it seems to fall down like a theatre curtain. Whereas the printed word domin- ated the early poster, with Rouchon and the Roman- tic poster the whole sheet started to be treated as a 17. Some attempts in colour, using printing inks, were made for the publisher Curmer, for instance, but they remained scarce. 18. See Rouchon , Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, 1983. Posters by Rouchon - who protected his invention by legal dépôt - have become very rare; the Bibliothèque Nationale holds (in the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra) the largest collection of his work. His posters were very famous: they were mentioned by Balzac, photographed by contemporaries and used as a symbol for the 'irritating posters' that covered the capital's walls with huge splashes of colour, as described by the archi- tect of the Paris Opéra, Jules Garnier, in his article 'Les Affiches agaçantes', Gazette des Beaux- Arts , December 1871, 490-94.

The increasing poster craze in Paris soon resulted in legislation that restricted posters to certain loca- tions: in addition to being displayed around the newspaper kiosks, the Morris Company was allowed to erect all over the town its famous colonnes , still familiar today. Special kinds of posters were made for the Morris colonnes , which were managed by an advertising company ( compagnie d'affichage ) run by the same people, and they were sometimes issued by the printers also owned by the Morris Company. Their posters were composed of two sheets, one printed by a lithographic printer and the other by a typographic printer.22 The text was printed on the background colour paper,23 while the pic- ture, placed in the centre, could be exchanged periodically.24 A poster of 1880 (fig. 206) exemplifies this type of poster dominated by Anglo-American models: the background yellow paper carries black typography (issued by ' typo Morris Père et Fils ' ) that includes bold 'American' advertising typefaces (in the names 'Félix Carioť, 'Lolo' and 'Lola') derived from the 'Egyptian' romantic advertising letters - themselves derived from the Didot typeface - that are present here (in the names 'L. Renz' and 'Boisset's'). The 'Egyptian' was a French typeface, invented at the time of the Egyptian Revival, but the 'American' was a typeface imported from American posters and Far West commercial spelling, based on bold and distorted lettering. The proportions of letters are dis- torted in one of two directions, according to their location - they become wider for words at the top and bottom of the poster, but taller for words at the sides, so that they can be squeezed into the available space: the effect is akin to vision through distorted glasses, and this recalls some of the attractions of the amusement parks. This approach reverses the rela- tionship between text and image found in the Franconi poster and in the theatre poster in Papil- lon's tradition: the centre is now given over to the image, and the text is relegated to the periphery; thus, the earlier metaphor of the textual panel or blackboard is abandoned in favour of the new metaphor of the framed painting. This choice seems to illustrate adequately one of the topoi of the poster critics who followed the pioneering texts of Huys- mans, Roger Marx and Fénéon, and who opposed 207.

In 1868 for Champfleury's Les Chats , Manet realized the most famous poster of this type, which was, however, issued by Gadet and not by Morris. This separation of the poster into two sheets involved two different printers in a way that affects today's collections, whether public ones, such as is to be found in the Bibliothèque Nationale, or those derived from private collectors, such as those to be seen in the Musée de la Publi- cité, for the dépôt légal was made by the printer, and collec- tors often found what they sought in the printer's shop. 23. This was an inexpensive kind of paper used in packaging that was nicknamed 'sugar paper' (papier à sucre ) as it was used to pack sugar-loafs ; the same paper, in blue, had been used since the eighteenth century as covers for the French chap- books of the 'bibliothèque bleue', and then, usually in yellow, as covers for French romantic novels, and later for the 'Charpentier' pocket-books. 24. Other solutions adapted for use on the Morris colonnes were successfully produced by other printers following Chéret, who used very large and narrow papers printed in colour lithogra- phy, for instance in La Terre , the famous poster of 1889 for Zola's novel.</page><page sequence="10">372 FRENCH CIRCUS POSTERS 208.

Renz or M. Wulff. . . . The central image was printed by a famous company, known as Affiches américaines Ch. Lé vy, where the American reference was stressed :26 colour lithographic posters were still perceived as a modern American tech- nique. Three stones were required for this image, one for each colour, black, red and blue: the black for the drawing and the shadow of the horse; the blue for the sky and, combined with the red, for the figure ; the 'reserve' technique added white to the composi- tion, for the doves and the horse. The final effect recalls the art of shop signs, and shows a graceful flying image, freed from the laws of gravity in an Icarian dream ; it reminds one of the magic of orien- tal tales, such as The Enchanted Horse. This poster shows an interesting combination of primitivist pop- ular style and an incomplete grasp of the science of colour through its use of simultaneous contrasts and the eye-catching attraction of primary colours.27 Moreover, in parallel with the contemporary developments in book illustration, the reference in this poster to the Thousand and One Nights 3 Entertain- ments exemplifies the growing fashion for literary allusion.28 Chéret, the son of a Parisian typographer, was born in 1836, and belonged to the most cultivated part of the Parisian working-class; although he started his apprenticeship drawing letters in a litho- graphic workshop at the age of thirteen, he also made Sunday visits to the Louvre, and took evening lessons at the Ecole Gratuite de Dessin run by Lecoq de Boisbaudran, whose drawing method was based on visual memory. During his long stay in England (1859-66) Chéret became familiar with the Anglo- American poster techniques and with the art of illus- trated commercial and cultural posters, which were well advanced in comparison to what then existed in France. According to his earliest biographer, his friend the collector Maindron, he made there aboùt twenty posters for opera, circus and music-hall : no examples of these are known to me, nor did Main- dron ever have any of them in his collection. They also escaped the legal dépôt obligation at the Biblio- thèque Nationale, as they were printed in England.29 It has been suggested, and it is likely,30 that Chéret saw the big and impressive colour advertisements issued by American circuses on tour in England,31 before they started touring on the Continent. Such huge posters (examples of which are held in the col- lection of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) are dated precisely by the copyright line, and look like printed versions of fairground booth paint- ings ; two of them, one with dancing clowns (dated 1 856) and another with a female rider standing on 25. Huysmans first turned to this subject in the conclusion of his 1 88 1 Salon, and returned to it when he spoke of Chéret in Certains in 1889. Marx repeated Huysmans's idea in the pre- face of the Chéret exhibition catalogue issued in December 1889, one month after Certains was published. This is a recur- rent idea in Fénéon's art-critical writings, from 1884 to the article 'Chez les barbouilleurs' of 1891 for Le Père Peinard ; see Félix Fénéon, Oeuvres plus que complètes , edited by J. Halperin, I, Geneva 1970. 26.

This was reissued in the form of a romantic, illustrated book by Bourdin in 1846 in the Galland translation, and, in its nar- rative structure, was related to the idea of the serial novel. 29.

This book includes Main- dron's catalogue of Chéret's posters, referred to here by 'M' followed by the catalogue number. It would be interesting to find out whether Chéret's twenty or so posters produced in England are kept somewhere in an English collection. 30. Chéret s clowns seem also to derive from the tradition of French caricatures shown in the journals run by Philipon and Aubert, and his 'zig-zag' lettering from the lithographic 'diabolic alphabets' published by Aubert in the 1830s. For a discussion of these alphabets, see S. Le Men, 'De l'image au livre: L'éditeur Aubert et 1' abécédaire en estampes', Nouvelles de V estampe, XC, 1986, pp. 17-30. But a combined influence is very possible with an artist like Chéret, whose art is largely based upon an intense visual memory. 31. J.

After a few years, in July 1881, Chéret sold his studio to Chaix and Co., which by then was located at 18, rue Brunei, and kept, within the Chaix printing plant, the artistic direction of his own branch, called the ' succursale Chéreť; in May 1 890 he moved to the Chaix main printing workshop at 18, rue Bergère, and, from then on, used the signature imprimerie Chaix ( ateliers Chéret) P Chéreťs style was very influential in the develop- ment of French posters, and it extended to include Toulouse-Lautrec and Bonnard. A self-made man, he succeeded in the printing industry, and was awarded a gold medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1889, where the first retrospective exhibition of 32.

This was Cheret s hrst success and the start ot his career, but it was not his first attempt in France at the technique: after a few months' stay in London in 1858, Chéret briefly returned to France, where he made a colour lithographic poster for Orphée aux enfers by Offenbach, commissioned for 100 francs and printed in Lemercier's printing workshop, where Gavarni admired it. Lemercier was the leading French printer for colour techniques and photomechanical processes in the generation that followed that of Curmer. 35.

A fervent nationalist, he gained official recognition for making the Anglo- American poster technique a truly French industrial art; in 1890 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, for being 4 the creator of an art industry', following a petition signed by famous artists and writers of the time, from Rodin to Daudet.37 As was the case with his contemporary Gustave Doré, Chéret was also a self-taught artist able to take visual lessons from anywhere, and was gifted with an excel- lent visual memory. He multiplied pictorial quo- tations from various other works of art : the range of his inspiration (at least in his circus posters) goes from a horse from the Parthenon (fig. 207) to the avant-garde paintings of Manet (fig. 208) and, later, of Seurat,38 from playing-cards, popular imagery and heraldry (fig. 209) to fairground paintings (fig. 210) and Japanese prints (figs. 211 and 212).

Postcard in the series Tout Paris showing the Cirque d'Hiver, c. 1 900 (Paris, Collection Villiers) . was influenced by illustrators like Grévin and, later on, Grandville (figs. 208 and 2 10), 39 although it referred back also to the great mural painting tradi- tion of Tiepolo - reproductions of whose ceilings adorned Chéreťs studio - and to the art of Rubens and Watteau, whom he had discovered in the Louvre. Welcoming and friendly, he charmed all who visited his studio, the door of which was ever open, and which became the place for social gather- ings. He had a great sense of fashion, and succeeded in pleasing with his posters all his audiences.40 Among his other posters - for commercial brands, serialized novels in the press ( romans-feuilletons ), and other kinds of shows - circus posters became over the years a recurrent event, through which he made new experiments in his art; they are very successful com- pared to those of fellow-printers like Appell or Charles and Emile Lévy. Once in France, Chéret started by making posters for music-halls, then worked shortly for the Cirque d'Hiver, before he became involved with posters for the Hippodrome and, finally, for the Nouveau Cirque. The music- halls (1 cafés-concerts ) circus posters were made for the Folies-Bergère from 1874 to 1893 (59 posters)41 and for the Concert de l'Horloge, from 1876 to 1879 (18 posters)42 : circus companies and artists, either from the Gingerbread Fair or from foreign countries, were invited to present their shows. Three posters for the Cirque d'Hiver43 (Maindron 347-49) were commis- sioned in 1876; Chéret worked for the two most 39.

He did not, however, work for the Franconi and Laloue's Cirque d'Eté, nor for the famous Mont- martre circus, the Cirque Fernando, frequented by artists, and opened in 1875.44 From time to time Chéret received other circus commissions,45 and also for posters for export and for individual artists, such as Bidel for his booth in Avenue des Amandiers. As Pierrot was for Willette, the clown figure for 44. For circus architecture in France, see C. Dupavillon, Architec- ture du cirque des origines à nos jours , Paris 1 982. The Hippodrome du Pont de l'Aima was located on the right bank, close to the River Seine; it existed from 1878 to 1892. The Nouveau Cirque, 247-51 rue Saint-Honoré Nouveau Cirque, operated from 1886 to 1926; close to the Palais Royal, but still in the fashionable rue Saint-Honoré, it replaced the Reichshoffen panorama and was in turn replaced by a Pathé film theatre, which shows an interesting continuity of shows expressly catering to large audiences. The Cirque d'Eté was located in the Carré marigny, close to the Champs Elysées promen- ade; built by Hittorff on the site of a wooden circus and opened in 1843, the Cirque d'Eté was the most famous archi- tectural circus in Paris. The Cirque Fernando was located on the 'grands boulevards' on the south side of Montmartre, at the corner of the rue des Martyrs and the boulevard Rochechouart. It was built by the architect Gridarne, at a site that the circus company had established a few years earlier. 45.

Anonymous, 4 Grand Théâtre-Cirque Miniature - Des Singes Savants' , lithograph (Paris, Musée de la Publicité) . Chéret was a kind of self-portrait that featured in many of his posters in addition to the circus ones.46 However, his circus posters were never acclaimed by the press as much as his other posters were, the release of which journalists seemed to have been watching out for. Maybe the reason for this relative lack of recognition is simple :47 circus posters, apart from a few exceptions for the Cirque d'Eté, the Hippodrome (figs. 212 and 213) and the Nouveau Cirque,48 were small in size ;49 they were not spread all over the city, but mostly displayed around the circuses in special frames - visible on old postcards and mentioned by Edmond de Goncourt at the end of his 1879 circus novel Les Frères Zemganm (fig. 214).50 Circus posters arose, once circuses had become permanent buildings, as urban substitutes for the coloured paintings that decorated the fronts of fair booths, and were used as a theatrical decor for the parade. Thus, they remained in the neigh- bourhood of the circus entrance. 46. See, for example, the poster Exposition universelle des Arts inco- hérents of 1889, reproduced in Frühe Plakat , p. 54, no. 186. 47. Some did, indeed, recognize the importance of the circus cycle in Chéreťs work, among them his friend and excellent critic, the novelist Félicien Champsaur, who himself wrote a circus novel, Entrée de clowns , for which he asked Chéret to illustrate its cover. 48. The three posters of 1876 are in the double colombier format. Rouchon's and Chéreťs large posters ('double colom- bier' format) were displayed in horse-drawn carriages (figs. 209 and 226), and Chéreťs hippodrome posters were placed on Morris colonnes (fig. 212). For the Nouveau Cirque, examples would include Willette and the anonymous Lévy poster of 1889. 49. The format they used was *1/2 colombier* (about 600 X 400 mm) in height. 50. 'Sous les clartés tranquilles du gaz, dans leurs petits cadres de fonte, sur de belles affiches jaunes à l'impression toute fraîche, se lisaient en immenses lettres: LES DEBUTS DES FRERES ZEMGANO'. This is at the end of the novel, when the heroes are about to perform in the Cirque d'Eté, at the height of their tragic career.</page><page sequence="19">FRENCH CIRCUS POSTERS 381 In the 1 880s, the general fashion for posters meant that circus posters became more frequent and more specialized, according to the type of performances they announced rather than the place where they were given. For instance, the same design for Les Girard was used for the Folies-Bergère in 1877 (with a red background, M. 82) and again, two years later, for the Concert de L'Horloge (with a green back- ground, M. 138). This stronger link to performance than to place, quite understandable within the tradi- tion of touring circuses, is demonstrated by the rarity of posters showing circus buildings, either from inside or from outside.51 Another major distinction can be made between the artist or 'star' circus poster, recording one single show, and the company circus poster, recording a performance made of successive acts - for instance, Miss Nouma Hawa performing in the Gingerbread Fair (foire au pain d'épices ) (fig. 215), Miss Lala in the Folies-Bergère (fig. 216), whom Degas saw and painted in the Fernando circus - and, on the other hand, the Corvi circus poster, either in its own fairground (fig. 217) or at the Folies-Bergère (fig. 210). In the case of artists' pos- ters, the picture is focused on one or more figures performing their act: clowns, bare-back riders, trapeze artists, magicians, circus phenomena and animal tamers. Even though equestrian and clown themes remain the most frequent, horse iconography was no longer the dominant motif of circus posters, which had begun to include exotic shows given by foreign artists on tour from Spain, England, America, Japan or Arabia. But in the case of posters announcing a show, the picture was supposed to sum it up in one composition, acting as the pictorial equivalent of an illustrated textual programme (figs. 2 1 8 and 219). The motifs are simply juxtaposed without outlines, as in the Willette Nouveau Cirque poster (fig. 220) or delineated by rectangles or oval shapes, in a way that is reminiscent of the subdivi- sions of fair-booth paintings : a case in point is the Corvi poster (figs. 217 and 221). In the parade, a clown would show one picture after the other, at the same time as he explained the successive marvels of the performance played inside, and the painting accompanied his discourse.52 Circus posters often used the familiar motif of the clown advertising the show in front of pictures in the parade. Overall, the poster served as a promise to the audience about the performance : if the show failed to live up to these expectations, the spectator could claim a refund for his ticket.53 218. Anonymous, Hippodrome programme illustrated with a photo-mechanically produced vignette, 1879, 315 X 245 mm (Paris, Collection Villiers). 51 . There is one 'balloon view* of the Hippodrome, in an anony- mous poster of 1877 published by Emile Lévy (reproduced in Le Cirque français , 1981, no. 23), and an anonymous, undated, interior view of the Cirque d'Eté in another poster by the same printshop (reproduced ibid ; no. 26) ; in one Fernando circus poster (Gil Baer, Cirque Fernando: Spectacle varié tous les soirs , Paris, lithograph by F. Appel, undated; reproduced ibid, no. 28, and in E. Darragon, 'Pégase à Fernando: A propos de * Cirque ' et du réalisme de Seurat en 1891', Revue de Vart , lxxxvi, 1989, pp. 44-57), the façade of the newly built circus is shown. All of these architectural views celebrate the recent opening of permanent stable circuses. 52. The clown was following a rhetorical tradiUon based on the ancient arts of memory. Concerning the parade scene, called the 'bagatelle de la porte', there is a large iconographie tradi- tion, which culminates in Seurat's painting Parade de cirque ; for the theme as it is treated in texts, see the Goncourt novel already cited ; the novel by Louis Desnoyers, Les Aventures de Jean-Paul Choppart , first published in the Journal des enfans in 1831, and constantly reprinted during the course of the cen- tury; and the detailed text given by Fournel, op. cit., PP- 49-53- 53. As it is stated in the paragraph about performance arts pos- ters, under the 'affiche* opening in the Larousse Grand Diction- naire Universel du XIX è siècle : 'Tout changement dans le programme d'une représentation doit être annoncé sur l'aéf- fiche primitive par une bande de couleur différente; dans le cas contraire, tout spectateur à le droit de se faire restituer le prix de sa place*.</page><page sequence="20">382 FRENCH CIRCUS POSTERS 2 1 9. Anonymous, Cirque Piège official programme, 245 x 350 mm (Paris, Musée d'Orsay) . Chéret produced both types of posters, and care- fully respected their conventional language. But he gave them his style, and favoured most the motifs of the female rider (the symbol of the hippodrome) and the clown (the symbol of the circus). He also adopted the theme of the parade clown, which he used over and again in various other kinds of posters. One poster of 1 882 for the Hippodrome shows a vari- ation on this theme, and emphasises the pictographic rôle of these motifs as against translating the pro- gramme in visual terms (fig. 222) : on the left, the rider dances on the ť panneau ' on the back of the horse, while a clown holds a typographic poster; he shows his laughing face behind it, painted in the English tradition of Grimaldi's (the 'Auguste'),54 and his hand points to the word ť représentation ' (perform- ance). One line of the typographic programme, set within the illustrated poster, reads c exercices équestres et comiques ', and gives a verbal - albeit telegraphic - equivalent to the equestrian and clown figures. This poster by Chéret demonstrates the continuity that is characteristic of circus posters, which goes back to the early posters by Astley and Franconi. The one-man show type of poster fitted Chéreťs usual way of composing : in the centre of the poster, set against a dark shadow55 or a second figure, he placed a pale figure spinning in a spiral movement amplified by the direction of the letters. Hippodrome 54. See G. Pretini, L'anima del circolo con le memorie di Joseph Grimaldi di Charles Dickens , Udine 1990. 55.

Crowds at the Cirque Corvi, c. 1 900, photograph (Paris, Collection Villiers) . de Paris , Le Cheval de Feu is a good example of this style, where the circus 'artist' happens to be a horse (fig. 223). Chéret also enjoyed the programme type of poster, since he liked to fill up his posters with groups of people, animals or objects; he found new and different ways to present together all the com- ponents of a circus performance. He usually skipped the architectural theme, suggested only once for the newly built Nouveau Cirque (fig. 224). 56 Chéret investigated diagrammatic geometrical patterns in order to unify the dispersion of motifs inherent in the programme poster:57 once he referred to the theme of the horseshoe (M. 66) ; at other times he referred to the medallion subdivisions of the parade paint- ings, as in his witty Corvi "poster for the Folies- Bergère (fig. 210) where two motifs are quoted from the Corvi circus paintings (fig. 221), motifs which appeared also, in a more direct transcription, in the Corvi anonymous poster (fig. 217). The monkeys' feast towers the composition, on a table set over the curved line reading Folies- Ber gère ; and the acrobatic goat dancing on a ball now dances over the letter ťO' of the 'Corvi' name; the whole composition, full of movement, reveals the influence of Grandville's anthropomorphic bestiary over the Corvi circus per- formance and over Chéret's own art. Finally, Chéret adopted the diagonal subdivision of the rectangle, which he borrowed from playing cards and from heraldic imagery.

(figs. 224 and 22Ô)58 needed the dyiiamic subdivision offered by the letters in their smaller half -colombier versions. The diagonal line first occurred there, very successfully: in 1883, it was used to separate the representation of two main acts, the Japanese acro- bats and the lion-tamer (fig. 226) ; in 1885, it became an abstract division of red and blue colour fields, meant to activate different simultaneous colour con- trasts, between figure and background (fig. 209) : the floating clowns, whose distorted movements and laughing faces are expressed through angular black outlines and treated in a caricatural and expressive style, jump in pure colour. One sees here why Chéret was considered by Henry van de Velde as a forerun- ner of Art Nouveau. For the opening of the Nouveau Cirque in 1886 Chéret designed a famous poster, often compared to Seurat's Cirque of 1891, where the same device was used, though in a less modernist way, as it held a figurative meaning (fig. 224) :59 the red colour, falling diagonally, stands for the circus curtain, the gar dine, and the light blue-green colour for the swimming-pool, one of the major attractions of the place. A clown is falling into the pool, while trapeze artists exercise in the air. The dancing rider stands on the galloping horse, in front of which is pasted the painted face of the clown with his famous coiffure à trois pointes . In these two posters (figs. 209 and 224), consciously or not, Chéret used the colours of the city of Paris, as the Indépendants had done deliberately for the poster and the catalogue cover 58. A coloured notice was probably pasted on the poster to announce the forthcoming performance in those displayed in horse-drawn carriages (figs. 209 and 226). 59.

This witty play with the activities of the Indépendants, which showed the avant-garde neo- Impressionist paintings, happened at a time when Fénéon and Seurat were fascinated by Chéreťs art : 'with his charming alchemy, he suc- ceeded in proving . . . the famous "theory of comp- lementary colours" that absorbed Impressionists and Pointillists in 1886'.61 A flood of similar metaphors used by critics con- firms the deep interaction between the circus show, focused on the clown figure, the art of the poster, the art of Chéret and neo- Impressionists around 1889-90. Starobinski, for instance, mentioned the contrast between the joyful light of the circus and the dark, everyday life of the modern metropolis.62 Huysmans and Roger Marx noted a parallel between the happy colour splash of the poster, mastered by Chéret, set against the dirty urban wall, on the one side, and the bright colours of the neo- 60.

Impressionists contrasting with the shadowy hues of the Salon paintings on the other.63 These parallels may explain the reason why both Chéret and the Impressionists and neo-Impressionists were fascin- ated by the circus world, which they used as a metaphor for their art, as an indirect pictorial manifesto.64 After the 1890s, enthusiasm for the circus and for Chéreťs posters started to wane; Chéret himself almost stopped designing posters after 1900, devoting himself to mural decoration and pastel drawing. But for a brief moment around 1890 there had been an exceptional meeting of art with the circus theme, culminating in Seuraťs Cirque , a painting much influenced by Chéreťs posters,65 which represented the highest point of a long tradition. 63. See, for instance, Roger Marx, paraphrasing Huysmans: 'Arracher la rue à la monotonie grise et morne des édifices alignés au cordeau; y jeter le feu d'artifice des couleurs, le rayonnement de la joie; convertir les murailles, les soubasse- ments en surfaces décorables . . . c'est cela la tâche de Chéret', quoted in the preface to Pastels, lithographies, Esquisses : Affiches illustrées de Jules Chéret , Paris, Galeries du Théâtre d'Applica- tion, 1889, p. il. 64.
