<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Allotted Share Managing Fortune in Astrological Counseling in Contemporary India Caterina Guenzi Abstract: Anthropological studies on causality in South Asia in the past decades have focused mostly on local idioms of 'misfortune', with very little attention being paid to ideas of 'fortune' and 'luck'. This article, based on fieldwork carried out among astrologers and their clients in Bañaras, shows that astrology provides an ideological framework for the conceptualization and management of fortune in present-day urban India. According to astrologers' analyses of horoscopes, 'destiny' ( bhãgyay lit. 'allotted share') is conceived as a form of wealth acquired at birth that can be augmented or diminished as a result of planetary influences and personal choices. The author suggests that, beyond the Sanskrit tradition, the semantics of destiny can be linked to decision- making processes and values of achievement that mark the lives of middle- and upper-class families in contemporary India. Keywords: astrology, auspiciousness, Bañaras, causality, destiny, fortune, karma theory, luck Et Bhaga? Je ne perdrai pas notre temps à montrer que ce dieu « Part » s'occupe essentiellement de la richesse: la richesse est la matière essentielle des prières qu'on lui adresse, les mots qui la désignent (rayi, raí , dhána, vásix , ápnas) décorent les strophes où il apparaît. (Dumézil 1952: 51) In the past decades, two theoretical debates focusing on ideas semantically related to fortune and luck developed in the field of South Asian studies. The first was concerned with ideas of destiny and causality. If the interdisciplinary reflection on the various meanings and actual uses of 'karma theory' can be seen as its hard core (Keyes and Daniel 1983; O'Flaherty 1980), its focus, especially among anthropologists, was broader and included a discussion of local idioms of 'misfortune', such as ghost affliction, sorcery, divine anger, and so on (see, e.g., Social Analysis, Volume 56, Issue 2, Summer 2012, 39-55 © Berghahn Journals doi: 10. 3167/sa. 2012. 560204</page><page sequence="2">40 I Caterina Guenzi Kolenda 1964; Nichter 1992; Nuckolls 1981; Obeyesekere 1968; Sharma 1973; Wadley and Derr 1989). The second debate dealt with notions of 'auspicious- ness' and 'inauspiciousness'. As a counterpoint to Dumonťs (1970) assumption that the opposition between purity and pollution is the overwhelming, struc- turing principle of social relationships in the caste society, some scholars con- tended that another ideological polarity- between auspiciousness [subha] and inauspiciousness [asubha)- plays a major role in defining the status of persons and things in the Hindu context (Carman and Marglin 1985; see also Das 1982; Lambert 1997; Marglin 1985; Parry 1991; Raheja 1988; Säävälä 2003). These lively debates, which drew together anthropologists as well as Sanskrit scholars, were staged on the scene of South Asian studies in the 1980s until the early 1990s. Although local idioms of misfortune and in/auspiciousness were amply examined, ideas of fortune and luck were rarely evoked in these works, and, to my knowledge, they have not been submitted to any analytical investi- gation. Nevertheless, my ethnographic material, based on fieldwork conducted in Bañaras at different periods from 1999 to 2008, shows that such concepts play a crucial role in contemporary astrological consultations, not only as an idiom of destiny, but also as a means to influence choices and investments in family life. In order to show the importance of these ideas, this article will examine the social uses of the concept of bhãgya. The semantic field of bhãgya is close to that of 'fortune', and, in spite of being widely used in Sanskrit epic and religious literature, as well as in most contemporary Indian languages, it has not been hitherto sufficiently analyzed. As we shall see, during astrological counseling, the idea of bhãgya is used to evaluate and describe individual and collective shares of fortune. With the help of the data written in the horoscope, the astrologer identifies and calculates the material and symbolic 'lots' to which his clients are entitled, and, according to their wishes and needs, he elaborates strategies aimed at increasing, saving, or investing shares of wealth. Given the centrality of fortune in astrologers' work, how can we explain that such an idea was overlooked in past reflections concerning destiny, cau- sality, and auspiciousness, especially when focusing on the same region? The ethnographical accuracy of the research carried out by the authors contribut- ing to these earlier debates makes it highly improbable that they might have missed a crucial category of thought. This is especially the case since many of them came from the Chicago School, whereby indigenous concepts were taken as the main analytical tool through which to conceptualize Hindu society (Marriott 1989, 1990; Marriott and Inden 1977). What seems a more convinc- ing argument is that something may have actually changed in the way that people perceive destiny over the last decade, the span of time considered in my work. As Fernandes (2006), among others, has shown, the liberalization policy enacted by the Indian government to end its protective manufacturing policies and open many sectors to private and foreign investors in the last two decades, besides having an economic impact on some sectors of the population, has engendered a broader shift in the aspirations and values of the Indian middle classes. Although the role of consumption in the production of the morality, culture, and lifestyle of the Indian middle classes in the last decades has been</page><page sequence="3">The Allotted Share | 41 amply analyzed (see, e.g., Appadurai and Breckenridge 1996; Jaffrelot and van der Veer 2008; P. Varma 1998), few studies have carried out a micro-analysis of how these changes are reflected in people's language and vernacular concepts in ways that are more subtle than the assimilation of English words and the adoption of Western goods suggest. In this article I will argue that the social transformations following the liber- alization of the market in the early 1990s in India are reflected in the way that people talk about destiny in astrological counseling in Bañaras. The astrologers' clientele, composed mainly of middle- and upper-class families from urban set- tings, are confronted with new forms of social and spatial mobility that imply a potential increase or loss of economic, social, and symbolic capital. In this context, destiny is conceived as a malleable resource, as an investment that can be increased, diminished, or wasted, depending on the choices that one makes in life. As we shall see, by orienting people's choices in matter of educational, matrimonial, professional, and financial investments, astrologers elaborate strategies and remedies for a better management of fortune.1 Idioms of Destiny In the Bañaras cosmological landscape, astrology (jyotisa ) co-exists with other idioms of fate and causality, such as the karma theory, divine agency, demon- ology, and so on. Among these idioms of destiny, astrology as a form of Brah- manical, scripturally sanctioned ( sãstrik ) knowledge is often contrasted by the upper class to the lower class's 'superstitions' {andhavisvãs) , such as spirit pos- session ( bhut-pret bãdhã), magic (jãdn ), and sorcery (tonã-totkã) } Neverthe- less, as I shall illustrate, during astrological counseling, idioms of destiny- for example, ghostly attacks, sorcery, karmic retribution, god's will- are integrated into astrological theory, rather than being excluded or stigmatized. On the basis of what may be called an 'astrological reductionism', different idioms of fate are translated into the language of planetary movement, and qualitative ideas are transformed into quantified and visible data. As I have shown elsewhere (Guenzi 2008), the epistemological compatibility between astrology and other Hindu cosmologies rests mainly on the eclectic status of planets {graha ) that, in Sanskrit literature as well as in contemporary practice, are described not only as astral bodies but also as anthropomorphic deities, invisible demons, and semantic elements of a network of cosmological connections. What I want to examine here is the ideological device through which, during astrological counseling, different idioms of destiny are theoretically embedded into astrol- ogy, and how moral and religious ideas are objectified and formalized into the language of planetary positions. This will help us to understand what makes astrology a theory of destiny that matches the expectations and meets the needs of educated, urban middle and upper classes. The relationship between astrology and karma theory offers a paradigmatic example of the way that a different idiom of destiny may be theoretically embed- ded within the astrological paradigm: both the theory of karma and astrology</page><page sequence="4">42 I Caterina Guenzi are scholarly doctrines described at length in Sanskrit literature and recog- nized as orthodox within the Brahmanical tradition; both are used in popular Hinduism and are widespread in all parts of India; and both investigate the mechanisms that regulate human destiny by taking birth as a crucial, mean- ingful moment. Nevertheless, in spite of their similarity, the two theories are based on a conflicting conceptual ground. While in the karma theory the moral behavior of a person determines his or her subsequent life conditions, accord- ing to astrological theory, destiny and human acts are regulated by natural and cosmic principles that are independent from human responsibility. Bad and good behavior are thus seen as a necessary expression of the cosmic order and time. The contrast between the two theories is not surprising if we consider that, historically, horoscopic theory was introduced to India as an exogenous science at the beginning of the present era, when Greek astrological treatises were translated into Sanskrit and progressively integrated into Brahmanical culture (Pingree 1981). To solve the potential contradiction between the two theories, horoscopic treatises (jãtakasãstra ) contain a verse- known by contemporary astrologers as well- asserting that astrology is the science through which the "invisible fruits" ( adrsta phala ) resulting from past deeds, or past karma, become "vis- ible" ( drsta ) through planetary positions.3 This passage has led scholars like Pugh (1983) and Chenet (1985) to conflate karma and astrology into a single deterministic South Asian theory of destiny. Nevertheless, except for this verse, astrological treatises very rarely refer to karmic ideas and remain substantially independent from them. I find it more convincing to consider this passage as an ingenious ideological construct intended to eschew potential antagonism between the two theories and preserve the conceptual autonomy of astrology.4 Even if astrology is formally described as being subordinated to the karma theory, it is the karma theory that is substantially subsumed into astrological theory.5 In practice, during astrological counseling, clients' life conditions are attributed, in the great majority of the cases, to planetary influence. Karmic ideas are mentioned as a supplementary etiology only in a few, dramatic cases, such as the death of very young children or chronic and incurable diseases that are thought to be caused by bad deeds performed in previous lives.6 Another idiom of destiny with which astrology constantly interacts is divine agency. When dealing with the karma theory, astrological treatises describe planets as "indicators" or "signifiers" ( kãraka being the technical term in Sanskrit), while in other textual passages, the nine planets are described as anthropomorphic deities protecting or afflicting human beings. The ico- nography and mythology of the nine planetary deities ( navagraha ) is amply described in Hindu epic and devotional literature, and astral deities are repre- sented and worshipped in many Hindu temples of northern and southern India (Markel 1995). During counseling, astrologers constantly convert the benign or malefic influence of planetary deities into the numerical and quantified form of planetary positions written in the horoscope and vice versa. The technical lexicon used by astrologers expresses the continuity linking planets as divine beings and astral bodies. Thus, the word prabhãv is used to designate both</page><page sequence="5">The Allotted Share | 43 (supernatural) 'power' and (natural) 'influence', while drsti indicates both (divine) glance and (planetary) aspect. In order to control planetary influence, after examining planetary conjunctions codified in the horoscope, astrologers regularly prescribe to clients the worship of major, powerful gods of the Hindu pantheon such as Shiva, Vishnu, Hanuman, or Durga, since planetary deities are hierarchically subordinated to them. Sorcery ( tonã-totkã ), spirit affliction ( bhat-pret bãdhã ), evil eye ( rtãzãr ), and curse ( sãpa ) are also local idioms of causality incorporated into astrological theory. When a client wants to know whether he or she is a victim of this kind of attack, the astrologer checks the horoscope to determine whether the per- son is astrologically vulnerable to such an attack. To this end, the sixth house {šatru bhãva ) of the horoscope, which indicates the enemies ( šatru ) and the position of malefic planets such as Saturn, Rãhu, and Ketu, is to be examined in detail. The textual sanction to the translation of evil attacks into planetary influence comes from the characterization of graha as invisible and demonic 'seizers 'that is found not only in astrological treatises but also in medical and tantric literature. The term graha (from the root grati-, 'to seize') is used in this literature to refer to all sorts of demonic seizers afflicting human beings (Smith 2006). During astrological counseling, the idiom of spirit affliction and sorcery, which, as Parry (1994) has noted, Brahmans and the upper classes tend to see as superstition {andhavisvãs) , is 'rationalized' through the translation of the subjective fears and doubts of the client into the objective and visible data described in the horoscope. Astrologers and clients strengthen and legitimate the objectifying power of astrology by borrowing concepts from modern science. While anthropological works dealing with destiny and causality have focused exclusively on religious ideas, local discourses about fate in Bañaras do not seem to posit an epistemo- logica! hiatus between supernatural agencies and the natural forces regulating human life. During astrological counseling, the nine planets are often described as astral bodies that produce electromagnetic fields and emanate rays with dif- ferent wavelengths. Rings with precious stones corresponding to a planetary or astral body (ruby = Sun, pearl = Moon, coral = Mars, and so on) are regularly prescribed as a therapeutic means to filter and regulate the bodily absorption of planetary rays. Furthermore, because horoscopes are based on mathemati- cal and astronomical calculations and are nowadays made with sophisticated technological supports, such as computer software that astrologers display on their desktops or pocket PCs during consultations, astrology is often described as a form of 'scientific' knowledge. The legitimacy of astrology as a system of knowledge that is fitting for 'modernity' is strengthened by the fact that in Bañaras astrology is taught in two universities that dispense MA and PhD degrees in jyotisa. Not only are the university professors and lecturers among the most reputed astrologers in town, but many scientific researchers from the Bañaras Hindu University regularly consult them (when they do not practice astrology themselves).7 As it appears from what has been said above, astrology as a theory of destiny seems to fit the expectations of the educated, urban middle and upper classes,</page><page sequence="6">44 I Caterina Guenzi not only because it is a Brahmanical, scripturally sanctioned knowledge, incor- porating Hindu devotional practices and values, but also because it purports to embrace an ideology of rationality and modernity. As Prakash (1999) has shown, the translation of Hindu religious ideas into the language of modern science is a process that started during the colonial period, when Hindu religious reformers and practicing scientists reinterpreted and rewrote Hindu scriptures in light of scientific categories in order to prove their universal value. Combining devotional ideas and mathematical rules, ritual practices and digital technology, astrology in contemporary urban India plays a pivotal role in mediating between Hindu practices, on the one side, and scientific rationality and technology, on the other. The Semantics of Bhãgya The word used during astrological counseling to designate human fate and fortune is bhãgya. This is not an astrological technical term but rather a San- skrit-derived noun that is used in everyday Hindi, as well as in other Indian languages. While many authors have examined the meaning and the social uses of the idea of karma, the concept of bhãgya has rarely been investigated. To my knowledge, the only author who has highlighted the importance of the idea of bhãgya is Wadley (1983) in her study on Hindi literature dealing with ritual fasts {vrať). Referring to bhãgya as a "counterpoint to the karma doctrine" (ibid.: 161), she adds: It is well known that the concept and term karma, however defined, is not preva- lent or widely used in all Hindu communities. In the vrat literature, the most common term for destiny or fate is bhãgya. In these texts, karma quite clearly refers to actions, with specific attributions of human conditions due to actions. But bhãgya is destiny, or fate ... [The concept of bhãgya] presents a potential- ity of "luck" or chance or fate (understood as unrelated to past acts) that is not implied by either the classical concepts of karma nor the concept of karma found in the vrat literature, (ibid.: 159, 161) Unfortunately, Wadley does not go further in her analysis. A brief review of the history and the meaning of this term will help us to understand better its uses in the context of contemporary astrological counseling. The word bhãgya stems from the Sanskrit verbal root bhaj- (to divide, to share, to distribute, to allot) and is part of an illustrious lexical family whose first members are attested in Vedic literature.8 In the Rg-veda, bhaga means 'good fortune' or 'prosperity', and Bhaga, 'the Dispenser', is a deity who dis- tributes goods and pleasures.9 In the sacrificial system that is at the heart of the Vedic religion, the term bhãga is used to refer to the tangible 'portion' that human beings receive from gods, as distinct from the portion that human beings offer to gods. The deity Bhaga is said to attribute 'lots' of goods to men on the basis of a regular and predictable system of repartition without competition (Dumézil 1952). Nevertheless, interestingly, the generous and positive fortune- god of the hymns, Bhaga, in some later Vedic treatises - the Brãhmanas - has</page><page sequence="7">The Allotted Share | 45 his eyes burned and becomes blind.10 Bhaga's blindness may thus be seen as a dramatic representation of fortune's ambiguity: the one who allots prosperity and wealth does so according to an unsighted rule of distribution. In classical Sanskrit as well as in contemporary Hindi, the semantics of the term bhãgya- originally an adjective meaning 'entitled to a share'- conveys a similar ambiguity. Bhãgya has two main meanings. In its broadest sense, bhãgya is "the ineluctable rule of destiny according to which all human actions are predetermined" (R. Varma 1971: 766), that is, 'fate', 'destiny', 'time'. This sense is related by common expressions such as "It is written in the bhãgya" [bhãgya me likhã hai), "We can't get anything more than [what is decided by] the bhãgya " ( bhãgya se zyãdã kuch nahf miltã ), and "Nothing will happen but before or after [the moment decided by] the bhãgya " ( bhãgya kepahle , bhãgya ke bãd kuch nahf hogã ). Thus, an astrologer was explaining to a client that even a specialist of human destiny cannot change his own bhãgya : "If this were possible, my son-in-law, who died last year, would be still alive, my second daughter, who is 30 years old and still single, would be married, and I would be much richer than I am." In this sense of ineluctable fate, the concept of bhãgya is similar to that of daiva , the divine and transcendent force that is described in epic and philosophical Sanskrit literature (Nayak 1997). Differently from daiva , though, bhãgya is not a transcendental, abstract principle but rather an immanent, incarnated destiny. It denotes not an absolute fate but a fate that is intrinsically bound to the person 'entitled to a share'. The second meaning of bhãgya is 'fortune', 'luck', 'good chance', 'wealth'. Thus, the 'giver of bhãgya ' [bhãgyadã) is the lottery, and the adjective 'endowed with bhãgya ' (m. bhãgyavãn , f. bhãgyavatT, or bhãgyasãlT ) designates a pros- perous, fortunate, wealthy, and lucky person, while one who is 'devoid of bhãgya ' ( bhãgyahln ) is an unlucky person. As we have seen, from the etymo- logical point of view, this second meaning is the original one and still nowadays expresses the deepest sense of the concept of bhãgya . Bhãgya denotes the 'part', the 'lot', the fortune that is assigned to everyone at birth. This 'lot' may contain good and bad things, but it is viewed as a source of wealth that the person will enjoy during his or her lifetime. In this sense, the concept of bhãgya has semantic affinities with the juridical notion of dãyabhãga, that is, partition and inheritance in customary Hindu law. Dãyabhãga designates the portion of wealth attributed to everyone at birth: "each member of the family is entitled, by birth, to a portion of wealth whose fluctuant 'interest' becomes fixed and materialized at the moment of partition" (Dumont 1980: 26). 11 Similarly, bhãgya expresses the idea of a portion of wealth that people receive at birth and whose fluctuant interest becomes materialized at some moments of life. Shared Shares In reading a horoscope, astrologers have to identify and calculate someone's bhãgya. The horoscope contains information about the bhãgya in both the acceptations mentioned above. The bhãgya in the sense of destiny or fate can</page><page sequence="8">46 I Caterina Guenzi be investigated through the analysis of the full horoscope, composed of 12 houses, while the bhãgya in the sense of wealth and prosperity is precisely described in the ninth house of the horoscope, called the 'house of fortune' {bhãgya bhãva).12 Similarly, in the case of palm reading, the totality of the hand characteristics indicates bhãgya as fate, while bhãgya as prosperity can be examined through the 'line of fortune' ( bhãgya rekhã), also called the 'line of ascent' ( urdhva rekhã). Shares of destiny are not a human prerogative: land, houses, animals, cit- ies, the Indian nation- all are endowed with a 'lot' and are said to have a bhãgya. Most Hindu families seek an astrologer's advice before buying a piece of land or building a house in order to know whether the plot will yield good results as a place for living or for any economic activity. That is why many astrologers nowadays specialize in the branch of divinatory knowledge known as vãstusãstra (geomancy) and sell their scholarly expertise as examiners of 'the fate of the land' {zamïn kã bhãgya) or 'the fate of the house' ( makãn kã bhãgya) (Guenzi and Singh 2009). This is the way an astrologer described the importance of identifying the bhãgya of a land: By observing trees, you'll see how much the bhãgya of a land may vary ... there are lands where the trees can live up to hundreds of years, and other lands where they die after few years, because of the wind, because the soil is not thick enough ... By examining the horoscope of the land [zamïn kï kundalt], astrologers can detect the compactness, the age, and the fertility of the land, as well as the profits [lãbh] and the problems [nuksãn] that may arise on the land ... Land is like the womb of a woman: it may be fertile or not, and this will change in time. The idea of bhãgya is used in neither an anthropocentric nor an individu- alistic way. 'India's fate' ( Bhãrat kã bhãgya) is examined through the astral chart corresponding to the time of the 'national birth', that is, the proclama- tion of independence, and is shared by all the citizens of the country. On the basis of this chart, astrologers examine India's 'allotment' regarding foreign affairs, political elections, terrorist attacks, financial crisis, and so on. But more importantly, bhãgya may define a collective fate in the sense of a 'lot', a heritage shared by members of the same family. In the Hindi devotional songs described by Wadley (1983: 159), for example, the goddess Pârvatï is said to "eat" her father's bhãgya. The principle of shared bhãgya is amply discussed during astrological counseling since, according to Sanskrit astrological theory, horoscopes tell the destiny not only of the native (jãtaka) but also of his or her 'family connections' {parivãrik sambandh). Each house of the horoscope describes a different member of the family, and astrologers may thus find out all kinds of information about a person's grandparents, parents, brothers, sis- ters, husband or wife, uncles, cousins, children, and so on. More generally, the horoscope tells about any person participating in the bhãgya of the native, such as neighbors, servants, illegitimate partners, or professional colleagues. Family members represent for everyone an important 'share' in the 'lot' attrib- uted at birth. Nevertheless, for some individuals the family share may be more important than for others, as a substantial amount of wealth or loss in a person's</page><page sequence="9">The Allotted Share | 47 bhãgya can be determined through one's relatives. This was the case of a client whose aspiration was to become a Bollywood movie star and who had moved to Mumbai to start his career. His mother, worried about his future, consulted an astrologer. After examining his horoscope, the astrologer observed that the young man did not have the 'astral profile' to become a successful actor. The malefic planet Rãhu, situated in the 'house of career' (Jívikã sthãn ), was "cut- ting his good luck" ( bhãgya ko kãtnã). The man's horoscope was negative in many aspects. As the astrologer explained to the mother: His Rãhu is bad, his Saturn is bad, his Jupiter is bad ... Your son will never be stable, he will keep changing jobs, he is going to give lots of troubles to his parents ... he will never be successful as an actor. Please tell him to give up his career in the movie industry. He will never get a major role, he may just aspire, at best, to a marginal role. He is going to waste lots of money. Whatever he'll earn, he will lose. The mother confirmed the accuracy of the astrologer's remarks, adding that her son never listened to his parents. The astrologer went further in reading the horoscope and found that, in spite of his recurrent professional failures, the son would have a "rise of fortune" ( bhãgya-uday ) because of his future wife: There is one very good thing in your son's life: your son will marry a very famous movie star. The marriage will be celebrated between July 2000 and June 2001 . His wife will be very beautiful, very nice, and very rich . . . Your son will never listen to you, nor to his paternal uncles and aunties, but he will listen very carefully to his wife. After marriage, there will be a rise of fortune in his life. This is an example where a man's capital of fortune is constituted mainly by his wife's share of fortune. In many other cases, however, astrologers detect in women's horoscopes some 'defaults' ( dosa ) that may compromise the health or the career of the husband, and rituals have to be performed in order to ward off the danger. In addition to that between husband and wife, the sharing of bhãgya between parents and children is also believed to be very strong, and the destiny of children up to the age of 12 is said to be written in the parents' horoscope. Finding Out the 'Loť The 12 houses of the horoscope define different kinds of bhãgya: the ' bhãgya of money' ( dhan kã bhãgya) , the ' bhãgya of marriage' {sãdJ kã bhãgya ), the 'bhãgya of education' ( siksa kã bhãgya) , and so on. A person may, for exam- ple, have a very good bhãgya for financial wealth (second house) but a bad one for health (first house), or a bad bhãgya for marriage (seventh house) but a good one for career (tenth house). When consulting an astrologer, clients want to know the share, the portion, or the capital that they are entitled to by birth in the different aspects of their life. They may thus ask questions such as: "Is there a house in our bhãgyaV* "Is there a son in our bhãgyaV ' How many</page><page sequence="10">48 I Caterina Guenzi children will we have?" "Is there any land?" "Is there travel abroad?" "How many years (of life) have I been allotted in my bhãgyaV ' Nevertheless, the allotment that people are entitled to according to the horo- scope very often does not correspond to the share that they materially perceive and experience in their daily lives. I remember a couple who had come to see the astrologer because they were going through some financial troubles. Exam- ining their horoscope, the astrologer asserted: "The money is there ... I can see very clearly that you do have money. There is nothing to worry about." After listening silently for a while, the husband blurted out: "If the money is there ... where is this money?" (paisà hai... to kahã hail). This kind of gap between the visible, objective, and incontestable data written in the horoscope and people's perceived experience is very common. When referring to the horo- scope, astrologers use the verb honã (to be) (e.g., "The money is there"), while in describing people's experiences, they use verbs like lagnã (to look like, to seem) or mahsus honã (to feel like) (e.g., "You feel like you don't have any money"). Horoscopic exegesis thus refers to two levels of reality: the horoscope corresponds to the ontological level (where things are), while people's percep- tions are put on a phenomenological level (where things seem to be). One of the objectives of advisory sessions therefore consists in filling the gap between these two levels, so that people may obtain the things that they are entitled to and the truth of the horoscope may be preserved. Astrological theory contains some key concepts that are used during coun- seling to indicate to the clients how to get the material, intellectual, and rela- tional wealth that is due them, according to the horoscope. The concept of yog (lit., 'astral configuration') is used to indicate the moment in which the good allotted to the person is available to him or her. By reading a person's horo- scope, the astrologer may thus be able to say that, for example, "the yog for the house has arrived," "the yog for promotion will be present in six months," "between 2012 and 2014 you will have the yog for marriage," "the yog for a car has been there since 2010," and so on. Most yogs indicate when a share of wealth is temporarily stocked for the person, but some yogs endure for the extent of one's life (&lt; ajlvan yog) and are not limited to a special astral time. Thus, if a person has a "permanent yog for going abroad" {vides kã ajîvan yog), she or he will keep traveling to different countries or will emigrate. Since yogs are seen as the potential wealth that a person is endowed with, young women's yogs constitute a sort of 'astral dowry' that will be examined carefully before marriages are arranged. Clients may, for example, ask the astrologer to check whether their prospective daughter-in-law has a "yog for sons" ( larkõ kã yog), the most valuable yog for a bride. If a housewife has a yog for a house or car, this is said to increase her husband's and her family-in-law's chances to get these kinds of goods. When a yog indicates that a certain good is accessible, the astrologer encour- ages each client to do the very best to obtain the thing that is deposited in his or her 'astral store'. He may prescribe remedies such as the wearing of gold or silver rings with precious stones, since these are said to increase the absorption of positive planetary rays and to increase the self-confidence ( ãtmã-visvãs ) of</page><page sequence="11">The Allotted Share | 49 the person. Or he may ask the client to have a (vegetarian) sacrificial ritual cel- ebrated by Brahmans and addressed to major gods such as Shiva and Vishnu so that they will control malefic planetary influence. Although it usually indi- cates goods or wealth, the concept of yog may sometimes refer to a loss or to danger, as when a person has the ' yog for accidents'. In this case, rather than potential wealth, the yog indicates the 'risk' of getting one's share, and the astrologer will prescribe some remedial and protective measures in order to avoid the risk. If the concept of yog is used to inform the client about whether and when a certain good is available, the horoscope also contains information about where to find it. Let us consider the case of a woman from Ghazipur (a town near Bañaras), inquiring about her children's and husband's horoscope: $: About my daughter Nitu, you saw her horoscope last time and you wrote: "The yog for job is now" [naukrï kã yog abhï hai]. We would like to know in which field she will find it, and when ... I took everybody's horoscope before leaving Ghazipur. Here is her horoscope. A: She will find a job in the commercial sector, for example, in a bank, in a life insurance company, something like that . . . Ç: She told me to ask you this because she wants to know where she should send job applications ... A: In the commercial sector, yes ... but be careful, because she has many obstacles [bãdhã] in this moment, and there will be a delay . . . Ç: Should we celebrate some ritual for this? A: No, you should first think about settling her marriage. Actually, it is not the moment to think about the job. Now the yog for marriage has come. $: Really? So it has come??? A: Yes, I had written last year that the yog for marriage would arrive after one year ... now one year is over. Within three or four months, the marriage will be arranged. It will not be celebrated, but it will be arranged. That's why I told you to forget about the job for a while, right now it is time to think about marriage. Afterward, you will think again about the job. $: My daughter's father [$'s husband] told me to ask you about his job ... Here is his horoscope. He wants to know whether his promotion and transfer will come or not. A: The yog for his transfer is about to come. It will come in August or Septem- ber, in any case after June . . . Ç: Good! Will we have to move far away, or just in a close area? A: You will not move very far. According to the horoscope, you will not go any farther than 72 miles. Ç : With the transfer, will his promotion come as well ? A: Yes. $: Please, take a look at my son's horoscope, too. He lives and works in Delhi. I would like to know about his marriage . . . A: His yog has come as well. Ç: Really? Good. In which direction should we look for his marriage? A: You will find a suitable match in the north direction from where you are. That is, if you live in Ghazipur, it will be in or around Gorakhpur, in that area.</page><page sequence="12">50 I Caterina Guenzi Because of the network of correspondences that, according to astrological the- ory, links planets with spatial directions, social functions, material substances, and so on, astrologers are able to identify in which sector you may find a job, in which region you may find a matrimonial partner, in which field of study your children should specialize for their education, and so on. Thus, for example, since the planet Saturn represents iron and steel, as well as governmental jobs, the astrologer will suggest to a person having a strong Saturn to look for a job in the state-owned Indian Railways or in the public steel industry. A person's bhãgya is thought to be fluctuating, not only because of temporary planetary conjunctions (yog), but also because of 'planetary periods' ( dasã ). In Sanskrit astrological treatises, life is described as ideally lasting 120 years and is seen as a succession of nine 'great planetary periods' ( mahãdasã ), lasting from 6 to 20 years and divided into nine 'planetary sub-periods' [antardasã) .13 According to the nature of the planet ruling the period and the sub-period, as well as their position in the person's horoscope, planetary periods are classified as 'abundant' ( sampürna ), 'empty' (rcfcíã), or 'malefic' ( anistaphalã ) ( Brhat jãtaka, 8:5). The share of fortune allotted at birth will increase and fructify dur- ing prosperous planetary periods, will be scarce during empty periods, and will decrease during malefic periods. I shall here pay special attention to abundant and empty periods, since malefic planetary influence has received extensive attention in literature dealing with misfortune and inauspiciousness (see Fuller 1992: chap. 10; Guenzi 2008; Pugh 1983; Raheja 1988). During astrological counseling, empty and abundant planetary periods are used to define economic strategies of saving or investing shares of fortune. These strategies may be explicitly formulated in terms of an opposition between jobs and business. While regular employment is thought to be good during empty periods, commercial activities should be undertaken during abundant periods. This is illustrated by the case of a 29-year-old unemployed man, the father of two children, who went to see an astrologer with his wife in order to learn about his professional perspectives: c?: [husband] Panditjï [respectful title], I want to know why I could not start any career up to now . . . A: [reading the horoscope] You will have a wonderful career after two years and a half, when you'll be 32 years old. But nothing will change until that time. Now you have to wait to the end of the planetary period you are going through. $: [wife] Panditjï, should he open a shop or should he look for a job? He is educated . . . What should we do? A: At the moment, because of this planetary period, he should rather get a job [naukrï]. After turning 32, he will be able to do whatever he wants, either open a shop or start a business, whatever ... it will work. $: You mean to say that this is not in his bhãgya right now [inke bhãgya më abhï nahï hai ]? A: If he opens a shop now, he is definitely going to lose money. He should look for regular employment- in Central India, in the region between Jabalpur and Nagpur ...</page><page sequence="13">The Allotted Share | 51 $: [talking to the husband] Do you understand? He is saying that [the shop] will work only when it will be in your bhãgya [jab bhT tumhãre bhãgya me jo rahegã, tabhï hogã]. 'Astral capital' and financial capital seem to be managed according to simi- lar principles and are somewhat transposed, the one into the other, during astrological counseling. When you do not have astral capital, you should be employed as a working force, but when you do have astral capital, you should make financial investments. This appears even more clearly in the case of a landowner Ayurvedic doctor consulting an astrologer: A: You are going to be very rich . . . &lt;3: Actually, I already have money. A: Yes, but I mean to say that you will become very rich. In the planetary period that is coming, you are going to earn lots of money. You should absolutely do something else than medical practice in order to get this money . . . Think seriously about it. &lt;S: But what could I do now that I am getting old? I am 45 ... A: But you are so young! Nowadays at 45 people are still very young ... Stop thinking about getting old ... Nowadays even 60-year-old men are full of life14... You should try to increase your willpower [icchã šakti]. The next 20 years are going to be fantastic for you, and 2002 in particular will bring you something new . . . you should consider it ... do you have any land? 3: Yes, I do. A: You have to do some business. If you just invest a small amount of money, you are going to have lots of profit. After some time, your business will get bigger, and you will get millions of rupees . . . In an India where, since 2000, Kauri Banega Crorepatiì (Who Will Become a Millionaire?) is the most popular television game show, hosted by the national movie stars Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, it is not surprising to see that the language of fortune has entered the reading of horoscopes and that those who can become millionaires are encouraged to try their luck. Astrolo- gers nevertheless know very well that their clients are not 'slumdog' million- aires, but people from the middle and upper classes who already dispose of a more or less substantial share of economic, cultural, and social capital. Even if not everybody has "millions of rupees" in his or her bhãgya , the various cases presented here demonstrate the idea that everybody is entitled to a 'wealth' that is stocked somewhere and can become available at particular moments. Conclusion In an essay exploring the meaning of the categories of auspiciousness (, šubha ) and inauspiciousness (&lt; ašubha ) in Hindu culture, Madan (1985) refers to astrolo- gers as the scholarly specialists of the auspicious and inauspicious qualities of time, and to planets and stars as the most important indicators of in/auspicious- ness in Hindu culture. According to Brahmanical sacred scriptures, rituals and</page><page sequence="14">52 I Caterina Guenzi other human activities do not bear fruit if they are not undertaken at the auspi- cious moments ( muhurta ) calculated by astrologers. What I have attempted to show in this article is that astrologers, besides being the specialists of in/auspi- cious timings, are also consulted as experts and managers of fortune ( bhãgya ) . They are asked to identify and evaluate the share of destiny attributed by birth and to suggest strategies for the management of this share. While auspiciousness, as Parry (1991: 272) notes, has the sense of 'predict- ing good', the semantics of fortune has rather to do with the idea of 'attributing goods'. This is not only the meaning of bhãgya from an etymological point of view, but, more importantly, this is the sense that the concept of destiny takes in contemporary astrological counseling in Bañaras. The horoscope is used as a heuristic tool- a 'scanner', in the words of one of my informants- through which bhãgya takes a visible and objective form and the goods attributed to everyone in matters of education, marriage, career, travels abroad, real estate and financial investments, and so on can be examined. Rather than the moral concept of karma, bhãgya- as wealth that is waiting somewhere and some- when- appears as a fitting idea for representing and dealing with the lives of educated, urban middle- and upper-class families in contemporary India.

The research presented in this article is based on intensive fieldwork carried out among 10 practitioners. Like most full-time astrologers ( jyotiçï ) in Bañaras, they are all male Brah- mans. All of them are considered professionally successful and have a regular clientele that comes to their office or home on a daily basis. Most of them have a Sanskrit background and some of them hold an academic position at the Bañaras Hindu University or at the Sanskrit University. Their clientele is mainly composed of Hindu, educated, urban middle and upper class families. The range of professions seeking astrologers' advice includes civil servants, businessmen, academics, doctors, engineers, as well as housewives, shopkeep- ers, drivers, employees in private companies, and unemployed persons. 2. About spirit possession as superstition and for a discussion about hierarchical levels between sãstrik (scripturally sanctioned) and laukik (popular) traditions in Hinduism, see Parry (1994: 226-248). 3. This concept may be formulated differently according to the texts. The Lagha-jãtakam of Varãhamihira, for example, says that "just as a lamp ( dlpa ) illuminates objects in darkness, astral configurations at birth show the maturation (pakti) of merits and faults accumulated in past lives" ( Laghu-jãtakam , 1.3). 4. As Halbfass (1980: 271) observes, the karma theory (in its different versions) was "fully established and almost universally accepted as a comprehensive world-view in classical and later Indian thought ... Concepts and theories which were initially used indepen- dently of and without reference to the karma theory, and which, in its earlier phases, appear side by side with it and as its possible rivals, are reinterpreted in the light of the karma theory, are accommodated to or even identified with it." 5. From the point of view of horoscopic theory, this subordination is obtained through a system of divisional charts dealing with planetary transits called açtakavarga (the eight [h] divisions). This sophisticated technical device, which is absent from Greco-Babylonian horoscopic theory, was developed uniquely by Indian astrologers in order to obtain infor- mation about past and future life conditions through the reading of a natal chart. 6. For an interpretation of why the karma theory and past deeds are invoked only in these particular cases, see Guenzi (forthcoming: chap. 5). 7. In my forthcoming book, I examine the historical background leading to, and the polem- ics raised by, the introduction of courses in "Vedic Astrology" in Indian universities, pro- moted by the Bharata Janatiya Party, the Hindu nationalist party, during its government (1998-2004). See Guenzi (forthcoming: chap. 2). 8. Although etymologically independent, the root bhaj- is semantically close to Greek verbs such as meiromai (to share) , from which stem ideas of fate such as moira and heimar- menè, and daiô (to share), which has led to daimón (see Balaudé 1997). In Sanskrit, the root bhaj- defines a very broad semantic field, including roots such as bhaks- (to partake of, to eat), bhik$- (to wish sharing, to beg), and bhañj- (to divide, to break). From bhaj- stems also the well-known Sanskrit concept of bhakti (devotion), originally meaning 'sharing', and then "accepting or adopting something as one's allotted share" (van Buitenen 1981: 24). 9. Bhaga, 'the Generous', is also a common epithet for gods, and in classical Sanskrit, as in contemporary Hindi, bhagavat (H. bhagavãn ) (possessing fortune, prosperous, holy, divine) is the common word for 'god'. The word bhaga also means 'vulva', the female genital, but this meaning seems to have a different etymology. Bhaga, 'the Dispenser', is an Indo-European god, corresponding to the Avestan Baga (god) and the Phrygian (Zeus) Bagaios (lord). 10. On the basis of this blindness, Dumézil (1956) asserts an explicit parallel between the Vedic deity Bhaga and the Roman goddess Fortuna. 11. In this passage (my translation), Dumont refers to the inheritance rule used in the Mitãksarã juridical tradition, found throughout India except in Bengal, where the Dãyabhãga tradition is followed.</page><page sequence="16">54 I Caterina Guenzi 12. Material wealth is also visible through, as well as in, the tenth house, the 'house of karma', which describes occupation, profession, and career. 13.1 refer here to the virnsottœri dasã system, which is prevalent in North India. According to this system, the succession of planetary periods is as follows: Sun = 6 years, Moon = 10 years, Mars = 7 years, Rãhu =18 years, Jupiter =16 years, Saturn =19 years, Mercury = 17 years, Ketu = 7 years, Venus = 20. The first planetary period in the life of a person is cal- culated according to the planet ruling the lunar mansion ( nakçatra), where the Moon is at the moment of birth. 14. The astrologer was 60 years old at the time. References Appadurai, Arjun, and Carol A. Breckenridge, eds. 1996. Consuming Modernity: Public Cul- ture in Contemporary India.
