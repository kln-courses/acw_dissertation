<plain_text><page sequence="1">Absolute and Personal Idealism PHILLIP FERREIRA Kutztown University jan olof bengtsson's TheWorldview ofPersonalismis, if anything, a histori cal tour deforce. While the books aim goes beyond mere history, readers cannot but be impressed by its account of the early personalists and their influence on later writers. The discussion of Jacobi, Schelling, and Lotze is particularly noteworthy; and with this discussion the development of both European and Anglo-American personalism must hereafter be seen in a new light. Impressive, too, is the account of various strains of personalism (existen tial personalism, Catholic personalism, speculative theism, etc.). And surely we have in these pages an important contribution to the history of both phi losophy and theology. Yet, by the book's end, I found myself uncomfortable with some of its claims. Most troubling to me is Bengtsson's characterization of the relation between absolute and personal idealism. While Bengtsson makes clear why various personalists rejected Hegel's absolute idealism, there is nowhere to be found a statement of the absolutist response. And further, viewing all of absolute idealism as the legitimate target of the personalist cri tique of Hegel, Bengtsson tars with the same brush the revised absolutism that developed in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Great Britain. In this, Bengtsson is following the lead of Scottish personal idealist, Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison (in the minds of many the most important member of the school). We are told that Pringle-Pattison's idealism (and personal idealism generally) is acceptable because it avoids the sins of Hegel's absolutism. Personal idealism, Bengtsson claims, is acceptable because it is committed to (while absolute idealism rejects) (i) the irreducibility of the individual person in experience, (ii) the existence of a concrete intuition of the real (upon which conceptualization is parasitic), (iii) the rejection of pantheism, and (iv) the existence of a "personal absolute." Now a proper evaluation of these claims would take us well beyond the THE PLURALIST Volume 3, Number 2 Summer 2008 : pp. 27-46 ?2008 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 27</page><page sequence="2">28 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 space available here. However, in the first section of this paper I would like to consider, if only in general terms, Pringle-Pattison's attack on absolute ideal ism as found in Hegelianism and Personality (an attack that Bengtsson largely endorses). I would mention that, while the attack in this work is principally directed against Hegel, the English absolutists, too, come in for their share of abuse. It is Pringle-Pattison's position (at least in this work) that the sins of the master are repeated by the disciples; and that, despite their claims to the contrary, there is little improvement in the modified absolutism of T. H. Green, F. H. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. In the second section I shall examine some major themes of Pringle Pattison's The Idea of God. In this, his most important work, Pringle-Patti son makes clear that he is still committed to some form of idealism, and it will be my concern to show how this commitment is developed. However, I believe that serious difficulties surround the position as formulated; and in my final remarks I shall try to make at least some of these difficulties clear. But before these problems can be considered, we must come to some understanding of Pringle-Pattison's early and most controversial work, Hege lianism and Personality. Part I: Hegelianism and Personality When Andrew Seths Hegelianism and Personality (the second volume of his Balfour Lectures) appeared in 1887, it confirmed to all what his previous work only hinted at. Seth had broken completely with the school of absolute idealism?the school with which his name had until this time been associ ated. This break is evidenced by three principal complaints in Hegelianism and Personality. These are (a) Hegel's (and absolute idealism's) identifica tion of logic with metaphysics, (b) his (and absolute idealism's) postulation of a supra-personal experience, and (c) his (and absolute idealism's) failure to acknowledge concrete perceptual experience as the ultimate criterion of knowledge. But let us consider these charges in turn. Pringle-Pattison remarks at several points that Hegel's Logic is essentially a redoing of the transcendental deduction as found in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Indeed, we are told that Logic is the centre of the Hegelian system. In this peculiarity we may trace the more immediate influence of Kant and of the Transcendental Logic which formed the core of Kants first great "Critique." Hegels Logic is neither more nor less than an expansion, a completion and</page><page sequence="3">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 29 rectification of Kant's table of categories. In other words, it is a sys tematic grammar of thought?an analysis of the nature of our general conceptions and of their relations to one another. The special result of the analysis is, indeed, just to make explicit the mutual relations of these conceptions, and to assign, therefore, to each its proper sphere of explanation, its proper place and function in the organism of knowledge. (Hegelianism and Personality 89) This is, I believe, a claim that no serious student of either Kant or Hegel would deny, and Pringle-Pattison is certainly right to emphasize this similarity. However, I think it must be acknowledged that in both Kant's first Critique and Hegel's Logic something more is at work. What Pringle-Pattison largely ignores in Hegelianism and Personality is the motive behind both Kant's and Hegel's logical/epistemological efforts. And the motive that I refer to here is the refutation of empirical scepticism. But since the refutation of scepticism holds such a central place in the work of both Kant and the absolute ideal ists, I think it worthwhile to revisit the issue in some detail.1 We should recall that it was through a careful reading of Hume that Kant was awakened from his "dogmatic slumbers." Kant realized that unless he could vindicate the existence of synthetic a priori propositions (most importantly that "the future will resemble the past"), then Hume's "problem of induction" could not be solved. And further, unless it could be established that there exists a set of a priori concepts that lie behind the formation of empirical concepts, there remains the possibility that the various linguistic-conceptual schemes employed by different persons at different times are wholly incommensurable. Put differently, without the vindication of a priori conceptual forms (and synthetic a priori judgments), scepticism carries the day. Now, if we are to be in a position to evaluate Pringle-Pattison's attack on Hegel's identification of logic with metaphysics, we must understand how Hegel saw Kant's own "transcendental logic" as both a success and a failure. And to this end I shall briefly consider here Kant's strategy in the first Critique. Kant's repudiation of scepticism, we should recall, turns entirely on the idea that space and time?what he calls our "a priori intuitions"?are primi tive and ineliminable aspects of experience?i.e., "conditions of any possible experience."2 And Kant further claims (in his "transcendental deduction") that space and time are themselves the product of a "conceptual synthesis"?a combination of the given data of sense according to specific "rules" which not only order these data but which provide us with a criterion by which we may distinguish between "objective" and "subjective" representations. But if space and time are a priori, and if they are the result of such a conceptual</page><page sequence="4">30 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 synthesis, then the concepts used in this synthesis?the categories? must be seen as a priori as well, i.e., as "conditions of any possible experience." I would note, too, that by calling space and time and the categories "conditions of any possible experience" Kant wants to assert that there is no experience? actual or possible?in which they are not operative. According to Kant we never have had, do not now have, nor could possibly have in the future an experience in which the a priori intuitions (space and time) and the categories are absent. But how does Kant establish this claim? By a thought experiment of sorts. Kant asks us to engage in an act of intellectual and imaginative abstraction. Try to imagine or conceive, he tells us, an experience in which space and time and the categories are not operative, and you will find that you cannot. (And if you think you can you have failed to analyze adequately your abstracted experience.) Crucial to understand, though, is the following: space and time (the a priori intuitions) are for Kant the result of categorial synthesis?the rule governed "running through" of the diverse data of sense. Should the in tuitive apprehension of sense be seen as existing prior to and independent of the categorial synthesis (something that the "transcendental aesthetic" can be construed as allowing) then the subsequent deduction of the categories fails. But despite the care Kant takes in making this point in his "transcendental deduction," there is, Hegel claims, a persisting ambiguity in his discussion. Rather than see the categories as part of an inextricable nexus comprising understanding and imagination and sense (all driven by reason), Kant often writes as though the categories reside solely within the understanding?i.e., within the judging subject s mind. However?and this is the point Hegel and his followers emphasized?if the categories are merely forms of the mind (the understanding), and if the contents of sense do not themselves inherently contain these forms, then they cannot be legitimately seen as "conditions of any possible experience." Indeed, if the categories are forms of the mind that constitute nothing more than a "filter" or "prism" through which sense data must pass, then they cannot be understood as a priori at all. But why is this? Simply because an account of knowledge that sees the categories as confined to the understanding leaves open the possibility that some creature whose psychological makeup is different from our own could interpret the data of sense according to its own (different) categories?i.e., its own psychological nature. Hence by claiming that the categories are but psychological "spectacles" through which the externally given sense data are viewed, they lose all claim to aprioricity. And, according to both Hegel and his absolutist successors, so far as Kant maintains the rigid separation between</page><page sequence="5">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 31 external sense and internal (i.e., "subjective") understanding, the critical phi losophy degenerates into just another form (albeit a sophisticated one) of sceptical empiricism. According to Hegel and his British followers, then, this error must be scrupulously avoided; that is, we must view the categories as the forms of both the mind and the world. And it is only if the "transcendental" perspec tive is maintained?i.e., it is only if the categories are understood as both psychologically and metaphysically necessary?that Kant's refutation of em pirical scepticism can succeed. Of course, Hegel tells us that maintaining this perspective carries with it costs that were not apparent to Kant. By immers ing the categories in the larger contents of experience?by seeing them as characterizing the structure of reality itself?we introduce into these a priori forms an impurity of sorts. Whatever form we identify as a condition of any possible experience (a category) must now be understood as, while still an ineliminable form of expe rience, subject to modification and correction by those contents of experience that do not immediately fall within its purview. For example, while it may be true that the relation of cause and effect is an ineliminable experiential form, cause and effect cannot explain my fuller experience. Hence, what is required is a progressive correction and restatement of the causal relation. That is, I must preserve its explanatory power; but I must also realize that it is not the whole truth?i.e., it is not a principle by which all my experience may be rendered transparent. However, when the conceptual conditions of any possible experience are seen in this light, I am forced to expand and revise them, replacing the less adequate (because less coherent and comprehensive) by fuller and more complete forms.3 To his credit, Pringle-Pattison recognizes that such a dialectical "criticism of categories"4 is at the heart of philosophy. However, to him this "criticism of categories" does not involve the analysis of "conditions of any possible experience." Categories for Pringle-Pattison appear to be either broadly ap plicable empirical concepts (derived by an act of intellectual abstraction on given sense data) or characteristic of our internal, contingently evolved psy chological space. Thus the criticism of categories is nothing more than the mapping out of this psychological/logical domain. As we are told: We are anthropomorphic, and necessarily so, to the inmost fibre of our thinking. Every category, that is, every description of existence or relation, is necessarily a transcript from our own nature and our own experience. Into some of our conceptions we put more, into oth ers less, of ourselves; but all modes of existence and forms of action</page><page sequence="6">32 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 are necessarily construed in terms of our own life. {Hegelianism and Personality 103) It should be emphasized here that this "transcript" of our innermost nature is one that, while it may contain its own internal necessity, should not be seen as laying bare the rational structure of the external world. Although Pringle Pattison does not deny that nature may be the result of a "rational plan" (God's), very little of that plan's rationality is accessible to us. The external world that comes to us in sense is, he tells us, "pure matter of factness" and wholly "alogical." And the various objects and events that physical reality presents to us exist in the relation of, as he puts it, "pure indifference" {Hege lianism and Personality 141-43). This is, of course, a view that has enjoyed considerable popularity during the past century. However, I would emphasize here that it proceeds upon an empiricist?and not an idealist?metaphysic; and I would emphasize too that it carries with it all of the skeptical baggage that the absolutist authors were concerned to set aside. I shall not dwell here on the skeptical and relativistic implications of this view. (These will be considered further down.) Rather I shall turn now to Pringle-Pattison's second complaint. And we find that this objectionable aspect of Hegelianism?the idea of supra-personal experience?has, once more, its source in Kant. But let us consider further how on this issue Kant's "critical philosophy" influenced Hegel. We should understand here that Kant sees the categories as providing the bonds of unity within a larger experiential manifold. But we should also understand that these categories constitute a nexus?-an interconnected whole in which the different a priori concepts stand in a relation of mutual impli cation. More importantly, though, these unifying concepts (categories) are seen by Kant as a limited manifestation of a deeper unity that conditions all experience?what he calls the "unity of apperception." Now Kant's point in discussing this "unity of apperception" is this: while the most primitive of experiences presupposes space and time and the categories as their condition, space and time and the categories presuppose a selfsame subject for whom the parade of sense exists. But more significantly, this selfsame subject presup poses an even more fundamental unity?a unity that cannot be confined to the perspective of this or that finite empirical consciousness. To follow Kant here we must take care to distinguish between what he calls "empirical" and "transcendental" apperception. Empirical apperception, we should understand, is the perspectival act of self-consciousness that every experience contains. That is to say, it is the conscious experience of the unity</page><page sequence="7">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 33 of our selves when we apprehend a spatio-temporal manifold of objects and events. The experience is always "mine" in the sense that it implies a selfsame subject for whom the parade of objects and events exist. Empirical appercep tion, in being "personal" or "perspectival," constitutes the larger part of what we commonly describe as "self-consciousness." However, "transcendental apperception" is somewhat different. Though providing the foundation for our focused empirical awareness, it is not de scribable as "self-conscious"?at least not in the same sense as empirical ap perception. While it certainly constitutes an experiential awareness on the part of the finite subject?and though it is perfectly continuous with empirical apperception?it is an experiential awareness that is essentially impersonal and nonperspectival in nature. Put more simply, transcendental apperception constitutes the postulated unity of all that exists. It is our ongoing (and largely unconscious) conviction that there is only one universe of objects and events and that this one universe is accessible, at least in its phenomenal form, to individual self-conscious subjects. Now the details of Kant's discussion of this matter could delay us for some time (Hegel's even longer). I would only mention that Kant's argu ment for both empirical and transcendental apperception is "transcendental" throughout. That is, these forms of apperception (the one fades off into the other) are seen as "conditions of any possible experience," and it is claimed that if they were not present, there would be no experience at all. We may note too that Pringle-Pattison fully acknowledges (indeed, insists upon) the fact that empirical apperception is present in all self-conscious ex perience; and he further acknowledges that, so far as empirical apperception becomes disrupted, the unity within our own awareness (and any conception of "self" we might possess) becomes compromised. But more than this: he is even willing to accept the idea of transcendental apperception?so long, that is, as it is "properly understood." But what constitutes a proper understanding for Pringle-Pattison? What Pringle-Pattison insists upon is that Kant's transcen dental unity of apperception be understood as nothing more than a "logical presupposition." That is, transcendental apperception is an idea that the expe riencing subject possesses?and it is, for Pringle-Pattison, nothing more than an idea. So far as the metaphysical boundaries of the subject are concerned, these must stop with something like empirical apperception. Selves do not, for Pringle-Pattison, spill beyond their boundaries and somehow "merge" with other selves. And the great error Hegel and his followers make is that they reify this idea; that is, they turn a merely "logical postulate" into a metaphysical reality. In what became the most discussed passage of the book, we read:5</page><page sequence="8">34 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 Though selfhood . . . involves a duality in unity, and is describable as subject-object, it is none the less true that each Self is a unique existence which is perfectly impervious, if I may so speak, to other selves?im pervious in a fashion of which the impenetrability of matter is a faint analogue. The self accordingly resists invasion; in its character of self it refuses to admit another self within itself, and thus be made, as it were, a mere retainer of something else. The unity of things . . . cannot be properly expressed by making it depend upon a unity of the Self in all thinkers; for the very characteristic of a self is this exclusiveness. So far from being a principle of union in the sense desired, the self is in truth the very apex of separation and differentiation. (Hegelianism and Personality iiy?iS, emphasis in the original) I would first point out that the position Pringle-Pattison takes here is some what modified in his later writings. While in his later works Pringle-Pattison emphasizes the ineliminability of the self (the claim that selves are impervious is greatly diminished), he is here demanding that selves be seen as absolutely separate and distinct. But this is, I suggest, a difficult view for someone who describes his position as "idealist." And, though we must for the moment ig nore Pringle-Pattisons subsequent modification of this position, let us consider briefly what Hegel and his followers saw as the epistemological implications of seeing selves as "impervious" to one another. Unless, the absolutists argued, what is called empirical apperception is continuous with an experience that transcends finite perspective (and is itself wholly nonempirical), all knowing states of the subject become not just "rep resentations" of an external world but mere representations. That is, unless perspectival experience is supported by an experience that is, strictly speaking, the possession of "no one in particular," then perspectival experience becomes wholly self-enclosed; and we may escape from this self-enclosedness only by putting our faith?blindly and unjustifiably?in some sort of mechanism by which reference between our psychological states and the external world is effected. To put the matter differently, if we are aware of the "boundar ies" of our own subjectivity, then, according to the absolutist, we are already beyond those boundaries; and, though we may be only dimly aware of it, we possess an experience (in common with others) of that beyond. To speak of ourselves as wholly impervious while at the same time making claims about what lies outside our impervious selfhood is, therefore, to be ensnared in a contradiction. Transcendental apperception may, indeed, be a "logical postu late"; however, according to the absolutist, it cannot be a mere postulate. And any philosophy that treats it as such remains powerless against the skeptic.</page><page sequence="9">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 35 From the perspective of English absolutism, the most cogent criticism made in Hegelianism and Personality is the one Pringle-Pattison takes from E A. Trendelenberg.6 And the point is simply that Hegel's Logic can not get off the ground unless there exists a criterion that is external to any given category as it undergoes dialectical transformation. To state the point more simply, thought in Hegels dialectic cannot function as its own measure. The relatively abstract category cannot be recognized as abstract (and thus "defec tive") without some concrete experience against which its shortcomings are apprehended. And further, for there to be a "dialectical advance" in thinking there must exist a concrete experience that provides suggestions as to how this advance should proceed. Pringle-Pattison summarizes the difficulty in reference to Hegel's category of "being" as follows: The real point at issue remains [in Hegel] untouched. When we say that a thing exists or possesses being, we may be saying very little about it; yet that is, on the other hand, the all-important assertion upon which all the rest are based. When we are assured that we are dealing with a reality, we can go on from the elementary statement of its existence to a more elaborate description of its nature. But that elementary statement must be originally made in virtue of some immediate assurance, some immediate datum of experience. We must touch reality somewhere; otherwise our whole construction is in the air. Whatever view we may take as to the precise locus and scope for such immediate certainty, no sophistry can permanently obscure our perception that the real must ht given. Thought cannot make it; thought only describes what it finds. (Hegelianism and Personality 123)7 What is curious about Pringle-Pattison's discussion of this matter is that? at least for a moment?he feigns a defense of Hegel. He points out that Hegel was well aware that every category was subject to the criterion of the Absolute Idea (the highest and most concrete category) and that the Idea is?though partially present in any lower category?also beyond it. However, after acknowledging this point, Pringle-Pattison goes on the attack. He tells his readers that nothing Hegel says on this head is intelligible, and that, in the end, Hegel's position is one in which abstract thought "excogitates" more abstract thought?all in the absence of a concrete datum. As proof of this, Pringle-Pattison directs our attention to passages in which Hegel describes given perception as general and abstract. And this, to Pringle-Pattison's think ing, establishes that Hegel rejects the idea that concrete experience is required for the dialectical unfolding of the categories. Now, rather than attempt a justification of Hegel's idiosyncratic use of</page><page sequence="10">36 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 terms (though I think one can be provided), I shall appeal here to the work of the English absolutists. They, like Pringle-Pattison, accept Trendelenberg s criticism. And they?years before Pringle-Pattison? make .the same point that is found in the passage quoted above.8 Indeed, no writer was more critical of Hegel's treatment of this matter than F. H. Bradley; and at the very heart of his Principles of Logic is the claim that the dialectical progress of thought demands a criterion that, while including thought, must go beyond mere thinking. Although Bradley insists that "thinking" is a necessary component in the conscious apprehension of objects and events, he equally insists that thinking is inextricably bound up with a concrete experience that comprises much more than thought.9 What is crucial to understand about Bradley s position, however, is this: the datum that Pringle-Pattison tells us must be present if thought is to make a dialectical advance is not for him (or any of the English absolutists) present in perception perse.10 Perception, Bradley tells us, is "ideal." And he thus agrees (as do Green and Bosanquet) with Hegel that what is given in any perceptual experience is only relatively concrete (and thus partially abstract). And what makes any given perception less than fully concrete is that it is isolated from perceptions that are not given. Present perception, on this view, is made pro gressively concrete only by being brought into relation with absent perception; and this is achieved through the activity of thought. Hence, what functions as the criterion of any given thought (or perception) is, for Bradley, a feeling base that is incapable of being located in any given perception (or series of perceptions), but which comprises all aspects of our experience and which provides us with our concrete sense of "reality as a whole."11 I think it interesting to note that Pringle-Pattison tends toward a similar view in his later years. However, in Hegelianism and Personality he remains committed to the idea that given perception?itself wholly independent of thought?is thought's true standard and measure. But this brings us to an other fundamental point of departure between Pringle-Pattison's Hegelianism and Personality and absolute idealism. Pringle-Pattison's position is, I have suggested, essentially dualist in nature. (Whether we call this dualism "empiri cist" or "realist" makes no difference.) And I say this because he argues for the complete externality of thought to its object. But since for Pringle-Pattison the perfectly concrete comes to us only in given perception, the activity of thought must always be one which renders abstract that which is initially (in perception) concrete. Hence, "thinking" on this view is an activity that carries us away from the concrete specificity of the real. This is, however, hardly the view of the absolutist.</page><page sequence="11">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 37 For the absolutist, to "think" is not to engage in an act of intellectual abstraction upon a perfectly concrete perceptual content. To think is, rather, to gather up and systematize the contents of experience, thereby making more concrete what at the level of mere perception shows only a low degree of specificity and individuality. While the "feeling base" provides us with our sense of the perfectly concrete, the explicit apprehension of concrete specific ity (uniqueness) in perception requires a thinking supplementation of these perceptual contents. Thought does not make reality; however, thought does elevate into self-consciousness what would, without thought's activity, remain "merely felt." But was Pringle-Pattison unaware of this doctrine when he wrote Hege lianism and Personality* This is, I think, doubtful. However, he does not disclose his reasons for ignoring it. And, while it is difficult to ascertain his precise motive, it seems likely that he was at this time so influenced by the Scottish philosophers of "common sense" (especially his "revered" teacher, Campbell Fraser) that he thought it unnecessary to examine what were to his mind unnecessary complications in the theory of knowledge. Part II: The Idea of God In the years 1912-13, Pringle-Pattison delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Aberdeen. The published version of these lectures appeared in 1917 under the title The Idea of God in the Light of Recent Philosophy, and, by virtually everyone's estimate, its publication represented the high point of his career. While the book is still critical of certain aspects of absolutism, the polemical tone of Hegelianism and Personality is largely absent. And the reader finds in these pages the thoughts of a mature thinker who is deeply committed to his subject and who is trying his best to articulate some dif ficult and controversial ideas. In the early chapters of this book, Pringle-Pattison provides only a vague outline of the epistemological view he now holds (still greatly influenced by the Scottish common sense school).12 And the reason why such matters oc cupy so little of his time is that he does not see them as particularly relevant to the issues he wants to examine. Indeed, he now tells us that no form of idealism can be established through a consideration of logic or epistemology. However, he also tells us that the idealistic worldview can, and should, be secured through a consideration of value. And for more than four hundred pages Pringle-Pattison argues for moral and religious views that to a great extent resemble (at least superficially) those of the absolutists whom he had</page><page sequence="12">38 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 previously spent so much time attacking. But let us begin by considering the similarities between Pringle-Pattison's position in The Idea of God and the moral theory of the English absolute idealists. We may first notice that Pringle-Pattison has come to agree with the absolutists that the moral life is principally characterized by an individuals effort to realize his or her "true self." And for both Pringle-Pattison and the absolutists the true self is to be found only within the larger community of persons. I would offer here a brief passage in which Pringle-Pattison approv ingly quotes Bernard Bosanquet: [Bosanquet tells us that] "The unit. . . looks from itself and not to itself and asks nothing better than to be lost in the whole." Nothing could be truer. It is the familiar paradox of the ethical and religious life, dying to live, self-realization through self-sacrifice, self-development through absorption in objective interests and in the currents of the universal life. The individual who would find his end in the culture of his own personality, whether as a moral work of art or in the wider fields of lit erature and taste, suffers the same defect as the voluptuary who pursues pleasure for pleasures sake .... Although the individual may not make himself his own End, the world of finite individuals may well constitute the End of the Absolute. {The Idea of God ?So) But what are we to make of this passage? Although the final sentence emphasizes the dependency of the whole on the individuals it comprises, certainly too there is the admission that the individuals own self-realization is found in and through this same whole. However, this suggests that the individual person, in a very real sense, is that whole (or community)?per haps as much as he is his egoistic self. But if the individual person is, at the same time, the whole (in a real and substantive manner), does this not entail a commitment to just the kind of self-transcendence that is advocated by the absolutist? I think the answer to this question must be Yes. And to assert that we realize our "truest self" as a member of the community while at the same time insisting upon our "imperviousness" to other selves seems but a contradiction. Hence, if we are to take seriously the later Pringle-Pattison's comments on "self-realization," it seems to me that we must understand him as having rejected (at least in passages like these) his previous conception of the boundaries of the individual person. But let us also consider how our communal membership relates to the idea of "self-sacrifice." For the English absolutists (and it would now seem for Pringle-Pattison), unless all finite individuals?all persons?are, in one sense, "joined at the hip," the possibility of genuinely selfless behavior falls</page><page sequence="13">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 39 by the wayside. From the absolutist perspective, it is only through the moral agent's grasping his membership in the moral community?indeed, grasping himself as an element in a single moral organism?that he becomes capable of sacrificing his own merely egoistic self for the sake of others. Indeed, the English absolutist argues that, while persons are necessarily distinct, they must at the same time share with others a bond of sameness or identity. And unless this aspect of sameness is thoroughly acknowledged?indeed, felt in the depth of an individual's being?there is no intelligible answer to the question "Why should I be moral if being moral entails self-sacrifice on my part?" According to the absolute idealist, then, moral feeling would be un done if persons were radically distinct (i.e., "impervious" to one another).13 And when we read Pringle-Pattison's discussion in The Idea of God, we find unfolding what appears to be much the same view. But what of the religious perspective? Again, I think that when we con sider what Pringle-Pattison has to say about our relation to God we discover a surprising similarity to the view of the absolutists. For example, we read that The idea of God . . . originates along with the idea of self and is innate in the same sense as the latter. The absolutely finite, if the paradoxical expression may be pardoned, would be entirely shut up within the four walls of its independent entity; i t would be a universe to itself with no consciousness of any Beyond, and of course, therefore, without the con sciousness of higher or lower. But man is not finite in this sense. Man is by contrast a finite-infinite being, conscious offinitude only through the presence of an infinite nature within him. [The Idea of God 247, my emphasis)14 And a few pages down: Theories of the sheer transcendence of the divine defeat their own object, because the very exaltation of the divine into an inaccessible Beyond confers a spurious independence or self-existence upon the finite. It is treated as existing in its own right. But as soon as we begin to treat God and man as two independent facts, we lose our hold upon the experi enced fact, which is the existence of the one in the other and through the other. ( The Idea of God 254) I would make two observations on these passages. First, just as we found in his discussion of morality, the "impervious self" ofHegelianism and Personality appears to have been left behind. Not only is the finite self an integral member of the moral community, it is now seen?at some level of its experience?as continuous with the infinite being. Indeed, the idea of the absolutely finite</page><page sequence="14">40 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 self is now seen as "spurious"; and if {per imposibile) it were to exist, it could not possess an awareness of higher and lower states of being. But this brings me to my second observation. Pringle-Pattison argues throughout The Idea of God that, without a proper understanding of our finite-infinite nature?our existence in and through God and God s existence in and through us?we are left with no solid basis for moral judgment. In deed, he tells us that it is only because we are finite-infinite beings that we are capable of either recognizing our own moral limitations or correcting them once they are recognized. And hence for both Pringle-Pattison and the absolutist, morality is ultimately grounded in the religious perspective. While both would agree that the process of self-realization begins by looking to the immediate community for guidance, in the end it must appeal to the entire system of reality?the being of the infinite. (Pringle-Pattison uses the term "God" to refer to this infinite; the absolutists prefer "the absolute.") Now in order to realize his deeper nature?his truest self?the individual must progressively (though imperfectly) envisage how a being of infinitely greater wisdom and understanding would, in any given situation, proceed. But to envisage this being, and to identify with him (or her or it) is, in ef fect, to abandon the merely personal will; it is to identify the personal will with what may be called "the divine will"?the divine will being the will that has incorporated within it (and accommodated itself to) the desires of all.15 However, for both Pringle-Pattison and the absolutist?and this is the point that must be emphasized?when this identification takes place, or more accurately, to the degree that it takes place, the individual has realized his true individuality, and this realization of true individuality entails both an awareness of one s uniqueness as a person and one s continuity with the infinite. It would be possible here to carry on at some length, citing passages from both the later Pringle-Pattison and the English absolutists, illustrating their common vision on this point. However, space precludes such an exercise. Instead, I shall now offer a few comments on some of the persisting disagree ments between Pringle-Pattison and his absolutist contemporaries.16 I would begin by considering the claim that both Bradley and Bosanquet have greatly misstated the relation between the finite individual and the ab solute. As Pringle-Pattison sees it, there is language in both writers (but espe cially Bradley) that suggests that, as one's moral and religious consciousness expands?that is, as one ascends towards an awareness of the absolute?finite individuality begins to disappear.17 And this, of course, Pringle-Pattison will have none of.</page><page sequence="15">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 41 Now, the amount of time and energy Pringle-Pattison devotes to this issue in The Idea of God is considerable. However, his discussion is, I suggest, often confused in that it fails to follow Bradley's use of the terms "finite individual" and "appearance." For example, in his Appearance and Reality Bradley some times says that in the absolute, finite individuality (an "appearance") somehow "merges" with the whole. However, Bradley also tells us that as the merely finite perspective is overcome, our awareness of true individuality increases. And any merging that takes place (as an individual grasps the whole more fully) is but the recognition that the individual's distinctness is dependent on an underlying unity?the unity of the absolute. Indeed, for Bradley, our sense of our own uniqueness?our true individuality?is coextensive with our ability to see ourselves within the context of the whole; and without an awareness of this context we experience ourselves (relatively) as mere kinds and not as unique. The underlying theory is that when any entity is intellectu ally decontextualized we lose the ability to see it as "this" or "that" particular thing. And only so far as we can see an entity as contextualized?as holding a precise place within the larger system of reality?can we apprehend its true uniqueness and specificity. In the case of Bosanquet, Pringle-Pattison's charge is even more mis placed; and this is because, perhaps more than any other author, Bosanquet emphasizes that the experience of "negativity"?his term for the apprehen sion of concrete individuality and difference within a system?is intensified as thought moves onward and upward in its grasp of the absolute. But "negativ ity," Bosanquet claims, must be strictly differentiated from "contradiction." In negativity, contradiction is overcome. Or, to put the matter in less tech nical language, so far as we see ourselves in the context of the fuller system of reality, just so far do we experience our true individuality and thus grasp "negativity" between the various components of that reality. To the degree that we lack an awareness of our unique individuality, our thought contains "contradiction" (the mere juxtaposing of "kinds"); and this is, for Bosanquet, an altogether different state of affairs.18 But it must be admitted there are more serious differences?differences that cannot be attributed to a misunderstanding of technical terms.19 And perhaps the most important of these differences is Pringle-Pattison's refusal to accept absolutism's characterization of individual personhood as "adjec tival" to reality. Pringle-Pattison takes great exception to this language, and he believes that its use indicates a profound confusion on the part of the absolutists. But why does Pringle-Pattison take this view? What we must understand, Pringle-Pattison tells us, is that individual</page><page sequence="16">4* THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 persons?true individuals?possess a "substantive" and not an "adjectival" existence. And when he tells us this he wants to emphasize first that their individuality is ineliminable\ and second that it is self-sufficient. But to grasp adequately the ideas of ineliminability and self-sufficiency is, he claims, to see that the individual does not stand to the infinite being in the way that "red" (an adjectival characteristic) stands to the "rose" that possesses this color. To describe the individual as "adjectival" to the absolute is, Pringle-Pattison claims, to suggest that the distinctness and independence of the self is but an "ap pearance" (which to him means an "illusion") that would be "overcome" and "merged" into the absolute only if we could see things more accurately.20 No, says Pringle-Pattison. There exists a genuine non-adjectival relation between finite beings to one another and to the infinite being; and this relation is not one upon which the basic individuality of this or that person depends. Such talk is, however, deeply problematic for the absolute idealist; and this is because to view the finite person in this fashion is, to his thinking, to absolutize its boundaries. And to absolutize the boundaries of the individual person is to erect a chasm between self and reality that not only reintroduces epistemic scepticism but reduces to incoherency the idea that we are "finite infinite" beings, or that as moral agents we possess a "ground of commonal ity" with the larger moral order. According to the absolutists, while it is certainly the case that our in dividual personhood cannot be eliminated or undone, this does not imply that we are self-sufficient creatures whose nature does not ultimately depend upon our relation to the whole of existence. The absolutists argue that the idea of a "finite-infinite" creature presupposes the finite creature's continu ity with and dependence upon the infinite. And to be continuous with and dependent upon the infinite means that we are, in a very real sense, its "ad jectives." We are adjectives of the infinite (the absolute) because it is what it is because of us, and we are what we are because of it. And, as the absolutists see it, Pringle-Pattison's rejection of this interdependency works against the larger idealist metaphysic found in The Idea of God. Conclusion While it is clear that Bengttson is quite sympathetic to idealism generally (and that he has problems with some of the non-idealistic formulations of personalism), he appears to accept entirely the interpretation of absolutism that is articulated by Pringle-Pattison (and numerous European personalists</page><page sequence="17">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 43 who preceded him). In this paper I have expressed my concerns with this interpretation, and these I would summarize as follows: (i) Bengtsson sees Pringle-Pattisons personal idealism as consistently developed across works like Hegelianism and Personality and The Idea of God. My view, it should now be clear, is that the logical/epis temological position that emerges in Hegelianism and Personality is essentially non-idealistic and inconsistent with much that is said in the later work. And, though Bengttson acknowledges the "inad equacy" of Pringle-Pattisons position in this area, he does not see it as inconsistent with the moral and religious views that are advocated in The Idea of God. (ii) Bengtsson argues that the essentially idealistic position of The Idea of God is an independent form of idealism (personal idealism). My view is that, so far as the position developed in this work is genu inely idealistic, it must be consistent with?though not necessarily the same as?absolutism (properly understood); and if these forms of idealism truly contradict one another, it is because one or the other has provided an incorrect analysis of the issue at hand. This does not mean that absolute and personal idealism cannot at times cover different ground and be concerned with different questions. However, many of the charges that Pringle-Pattison lodges against absolute idealism (even in The Idea of God) attack the metaphysical foundations of not just absolutism but of any doctrine that could legitimately call itself "idealistic." Of course, only a lengthy examination of the texts in question (and an analysis of some difficult metaphysical problems) could adequately establish the claims I make in this paper. And this must remain a project for another day. NOTES . My discussion relies heavily on (i) Hegel's Faith and Knowledge (the Cerf/Harris translation of Ghuben und Wissen, Albany 1977), esp. pp. 67-96 and (ii) Edward Caird's A Critical Account of the Phibsophy of Kant, esp. pp. 276-405. 2.

This criticism is found in Trendelenberg's Die bgische Frage in Hegels System (1843). 7. Quoted by Bengtsson on p. 121 of The Worldview ofPersonalism. 8. T. H. Green first makes this criticism in his review of John Caird's Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion. See Works 138-46.

See especially chapters eight and nine. 10. It is a serious error in the interpretation of Bradley to take isolated statements in the first edition of the Principles of Logic (Oxford, 1883) as supporting the view that perception per se provides us with a legitimate criterion of knowledge. Bernard Bosanquet pointed out in his Knowledge and Reality (London, 1885) that when Bradley occasionally made statements to this effect, it constituted a profound inconsistency within the book's larger theory. Bradley subsequently acknowledged the soundness of Bosanquet's criticism, and in all his works after 1885 he consistently maintained that given perception was partially "ideal" (abstract) and could not function as thought's ultimate criterion. 11. See my "Perceptual Ideality and the Ground of Inference, in Bradley Studies' 125-38. See also Bradley and the Structure of Knowledge 29-31, 83-84, 89-92, 255-8. 12. See, for example, The Idea of God In the Light of Recent Philosophy (Oxford, 1917), 242. 13. The final line of this passage should not be taken as suggesting that the community of finite selves alone is the ultimate source of our values. See Hegelianism and Personality 246. 14. Although this passage is made in reference to Descartes, Pringle-Pattison makes it clear that it expresses his own view as well. 15. The view of someone like T. H. Green is that "God's will" is not explicitly present until it has manifested itself in the consciousness of this or that finite person. And further, God's will is made "real and concrete" along with the self-realization of the individual moral agent. This is not to deny that there is a sense in which the "Divine will" exists prior to the acts of finite individuals. However, the divine will cannot be seen, prior to its formulation in the mind of a specific individual, as being in any sense "personal." See, for example, Green's Works 230?52. 16. Though he admits that Green is somewhat unclear on the point, Pringle-Pattison charges him with attributing to the infinite side of our being characteristics that could only belong to finite, perspectival awareness. To express the problem in Kantian terms, Green has attributed to transcendental apperception the characteristics of empirical ap perception, and this, he believes, is a fundamentally incoherent position ( The Idea of God, 195-99). The criticism, it should be noted, is quite different from what appeared in Hegelianism and Personality. It is not that Pringle-Pattison, at this point in his career, objects to the metaphysical continuity between finite and infinite being. Rather, he is insisting that the infinite side of our being (and any infinite being that extends beyond human finitude) cannot be said to possess the same sort of self-consciousness that is characteristic of finite intelligence. Now, to this criticism I would only say that this same point was discussed by Bosanquet at some length in 1902. (See "Some Recent Criticisms of Green Ethics," Science and Philosophy [1931] : 150-81. This article originally appeared in Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, new series, 2 [1902]: 25-62.) And, while Bosanquet did not think that Green actually made this mistake, he acknowledges that he could, at times, be read as doing so. Hence, there is no significant disagreement with Bosanquet (or, I would add, E H. Bradley) on this issue.</page><page sequence="19">Ferreira : Absolute and Personal Idealism 45 ij. Pringle-Pattisons most thorough discussion of Bradley is found in "A New Theory of the Absolute," Maris Place in the Cosmos and Other Essays (New York: 1902) 92-158. 18. This point was made in Bosanquet's Gifford Lectures of 1911. These lectures were subsequently published under the title The Principk of Individuality and Value (London, 1912). See especially p. 232 ff. 19.1 would mention, too, the disagreement about the giveness of value. Pringle-Pattison insists that our awareness of value is something that we di rectly experience. We do not "desire" or "value" certain things as a result of reflecting on them. What we desire is what we desire, and it is, to his mind, a confused philosophy that sees our apprehension of value as something that we "think our way into." The absolutist response to this claim is as follows: While it is true that value must be given in the sense of being immediately felt, any such given value cannot be accepted as ultimate. While the absolutist is cer tainly willing to accept the fact that we must directly experience value, he will insist that what we first embrace as "good" is rarely what we hold to be good after we have lived for awhile according to that conception. For the absolutist, ultimate value can only be grasped when we have directly experienced the inadequacy of certain desires. And it is only when we realize that many of the things we immediately value do not bring perma nent satisfaction that we are led to alter our values. But this process, the absolutist will insist, is mediated by thought throughout and is thus not wholly given. See Bosanquet's Principk of Individuality and Value 291?317. 20.
