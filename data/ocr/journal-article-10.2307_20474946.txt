DOWSON Basse Copette, 76390, Seine Maritime, France E-mail: thomasdowson@yahoo.co.uk (Received October 2006. Revised March 2007) ABSTRACT The shamanistic interpretation of southern African rock art has had a significant impact on the study of rock art world-wide, as well as the archaeology of southern Africa. Despite considerable theoretical and methodological developments over nearly three decades the approach has retained its basis in Cartesian thinking and overstated the role of the shaman in the control of supernatural forces. By eschewing Cartesian principles and resituating the shaman in an animic hunter-gatherer ontology, I propose a new direction for southern African hunter-gatherer rock art studies. I initiate this new approach here by drawing on a specific set of themes in rock art - those that still greatly influence the wider reception of hunter-gatherer arts, so-called images of daily life. The interaction of non-human animals and rock surfaces, rocks that have been rubbed smooth by rhinoceroses, is also considered. I argue that the control of supernatural potency was not the exclusive preserve of shamans, but that all human and non-human animals were involved in maintaining the continued circulation of these vital life forces through the various activities that constituted human and non-human beings' identities. The painting and engrav ing of these activities revealed a deeper understanding of the world to ensure its continued existence. Keywords: San hunter-gatherer rock art, rhinoceros rubbings, supernatural potency, hunters, gatherers, shamans. During the 1990s rock art researchers the world over were celebrating: a field of archaeological research that for a long time had been largely the preserve of amateur enthusiasts was fast gaining a more respectable position within the discipline. Rock art research began to contribute to discussions of epistemological and ethical issues in archaeology, and the study of rock art was becoming an integral part of certain undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The 1990s also saw the emergence of a debate in rock art research that impacted on the interpretation of rock arts the world over. In various academic and popular journals numerous authors have debated the appropriateness of shamanism for the interpretation of rock art imagery. Now, well into the second half of the first decade of the 2000s, this debate shows little sign of coming to a close, partly because the points under discussion remain unre solved - but also because the debate is at an impasse. The contributions to this discussion are becoming more and more personal, and it is increasingly being conducted by fewer and fewer individuals. In the early 1990s Timothy Yates, in a pioneering study of Scandinavian rock art, implored rock art scholars to think beyond constructing "chronologies... [and]... the stale discus sions of terminology" (1993: 35). Over a decade later, it is time, I believe, for us to think beyond some of the stale discussions of the appropriateness of shamanism. The discussions are going round in circles; and certain positions are becoming more firmly entrenched. The rock art/shamanism debate is clearly going nowhere. The reasons for this are indeed complex, but most significantly the debate is founded on certain fundamental misconceptions about 'shamanism' and the very activity of producing 'art'. In this paper I mark my departure from the shamanistic interpretation of hunter-gatherer rock arts of southern Africa specifically, and hunter-gatherer rock arts in general; and attempt to lead our interpretative endeavours in a new direction. First, I begin by commenting on the current state of the shamanism/rock art debate to demonstrate how futile it has become. There are two crucial misconceptions at work in this debate. The first concerns the way in which contemporary thinking about art and its origins has influenced how we think about hunter-gatherer rock art. In coming to address the origins of art, the shamanistic interpretation has become increasingly and more explicitly dependent on the idea of an anatomically modern human - a construct that is itself questionable. The second misconception is the very concept of shamanism itself. The place of shamanism in indigenous worldviews, particularly in rock art studies, has been simplified and overstated. The role of the shaman in these communities can be better understood I argue by paying attention to recent discussions of animism in anthropology. The basis of these two misconceptions is founded in Cartesian philosophy. After both resituating human beings within the world in which they live and paint/engrave, and the shaman within an animic ontology, I go on to show how a different reading of certain themes in southern African hunter-gatherer rock art can enable a new direction in the interpretation of hunter-gatherer rock arts in southern Africa, and elsewhere. THE SHAMANISM/ROCK ART DEBATE As someone who was once fully committed to the shaman istic interpretation of certain hunter-gatherer rock arts, I found the June 2006 issue of the South African Archaeological Bulletin an intriguing read. The intrigue lies in the juxtaposition of papers by David Lewis-Williams and Anne Solomon. Readers of the Bulletin will be familiar with their previous debate - an exchange that has clearly resolved little. Now, Lewis-Williams uses the publication of Jean-Loic Le Quellec's RockArt in Africa: Mythology and Legend (also, Art rupestre et mythologies en Afrique) to discuss certain issues that are frequently raised in opposition to the shamanistic approach. Solomon's piece is a standard book review of Lewis-Williams and Pearce's recent San Spiritu ality: Roots, Expressions and Social Consequences. If ever there was a time for the shamanism/rock art debate to move on it must surely be now. Solomon has for some time been attempting to provide an alternative to the interpretative approach to southern African rock art developed by Lewis Williams and others; and Solomon is not alone. Over time fewer and fewer writers have become more and more personal in their opposition to Lewis-Williams. Rarely do these writers acknowledge that a number of other scholars have also made</page><page sequence="2">50 South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 substantive contributions to what has become known as the shamanistic interpretation (for further details see Dowson 2001a: 319-322). But looking beyond the personal, what they offer as an alternative does not live up to expectations: the arguments are often based on misrepresentations, they are somewhat simplistic, they are often repetitive and, perhaps most significantly, they offer little heuristic potential. With this in mind, it is surprising to see such a confronta tional review of the new Lewis-Williams and Pearce book by Solomon. Given the obvious conflict of interest, the choice of Solomon to review this book must be called into question. In fact, Solomon was unwise to consider, let alone accept and submit, such a commission. A book review should present, in an unbiased and professional manner, an opinion on the content and scholarly value of the book. This is not to suggest in any way that Solomon is to be denied a voice in the debate; she has clearly not been denied a voice. Solomon has denied other rock art scholars a place in rock art research by creating an illusion that shamanism/rock art = Lewis-Williams. Solomon does not have to agree with these other scholars, but her repeated ignoring of other researchers and their scholarship is typical of the reverse discourse of feminist scholars, both broadly and more specifically within archaeology (see Dowson 2006; cf Butler 1990: 13). In a number of papers over the years Lewis-Williams has produced point-by-point rebuttals such as the one he produces in response to Le Quellec's book. Over the years these responses have become somewhat repetitive: compare, for instance, this response to Le Quellec, with one of Lewis-Williams's previous responses to his critics published by the Bulletin in 1998. Some of the points can be found in discussion papers and responses published by the Bulletin and other journals (CurrentAnthropology, for example) as far back as the early 1980s. The repetitiveness of these responses, no matter how accurate some of the specific points might or might not be, does little more than entrench some of the problems of the shamanistic interpretation. And, I believe, the shamanistic interpretation ends up coming across a lot more naively objectivist than is intended. For some time now I have felt uneasy with the direction of the shamanistic interpretation in rock art studies. I have been and remain equally convinced, however, that the opposition has clearly not produced a more profitable approach. The interpretative impasse results, I now believe, not from epistemological stubbornness, but rather because both sides of the shamanism/rock art debate are founded on a series of fundamental misconceptions that have to do with the way in which we think about art and the origins of art, and what the shaman is as a human being before we even start to think about how the work of a shaman is implicated in the production of certain rock arts. ART HISTORY AND THE ORIGINS OF ART Modern (mis)conceptions of 'art' are at the heart of the debate, albeit in different ways for different scholars. For instance, most attempts to arrest the ever-increasing momentum of the shamanistic approach make some or other appeal to art history/theory. And that ever-increasing momentum of the shamanistic approach now claims to reveal the holy grail of the history of art, i.e. the origins of art. The relevance and/or appro priateness of art history to non-Western artistic traditions is itself a much discussed topic, and has already been raised in the shamanism/rock art debate. But the fundamental misconcep tions in these positions are yet to be addressed. The study of rock art, world-wide, has been largely, but not entirely, developed by archaeologists using archaeological and anthropological theory and methods. Art historians and artists have dabbled with rock art. We should not be at all surprised by this. Art history's primary concern is with the story of Western Art; non-Western art, particularly rock art, is afforded little more than mystical status and merely serves as a convenient introductory device (Dowson 1995b, 1998c, 1999a). The legacy of art history is the grand magisterial accounts of art from its primitive origins in Western Europe, back in the mists of time, to the contemporary art of today, which sells for exorbitant amounts of money. The production of these 'histories of art' from earliest times to the present is as much an industry as is the industry of contemporary art itself. The late Sir Ernst Gombrich's The Story of Art is a prime, but certainly not unique, example. At the time of his death, this book, first published in 1950, was in its 16th edition and umpteenth impression and today still regularly appears in 'top 10 best seller' lists. Clearly it is well placed to have a powerful impact on the way in which people think about the history of art. South Africa has had its own share of such grand narratives of art history, where rock art traditions are said to 'tantalize' archaeologists and 'fasci nate' students of aesthetic form, while the real story of art begins with the arrival of Europeans and their artistic traditions (for example, Berman 1999). The idea, expressed by Solomon in her review of Lewis Williams and Pearce, and elsewhere by others, that rock art researchers should pay more attention to Western art theory is risible on ethical let alone intellectual grounds. The construct of African Art', which continues to exclude African rock art, has done very little for African Art, let alone rock art, other than enable it to enter a dealer-critic system where it fetches obscene sums of money for Western art dealers, ensuring the continued looting and destruction of Africa's cultural and historical heritage on a grand scale. If there are any true advances in our reception of what is disparagingly called African Art', it is more likely to have been a result of anthropological theory, not Western art theory. It is not at all surprising that substantial resources were given to university art history departments in the United Kingdom to encourage them to develop their West ern Art-focused curricula (see www.glaadh.ac.uk, see also Tat lock &amp; King 2006) in such ways as to include the teaching and learning of non-Western art, design and architectural traditions. When those opposing the shamanistic model suggest that we should be concentrating on the "more tangible aspects of art such as its location, content, techniques, styles and dating" (Bahn 2003: 46) their ignorance of Western art theory is itself revealing. It is just this sort of attention to the formal qualities of rock art that allows us simply to marvel at the skill of these 'early', 'primitive' artists, to be 'tantalized' and 'fascinated' by these images - to keep them locked in an unrecoverable past. I am inclined to think that what Tim Ingold (2000:131) has to say about Australian Aboriginal painters and Inuit and Yup'ik carvers is relevant for the study of rock art more generally: We must cease thinking of painting and carving as modalities of the production of art, and view art instead as one rather pe culiar, and historically very specific objectification of the activities of painting and carving. We are right to admire the skills of Australian Aboriginal painters, and of Inuit and Yup'ik carvers. [These skills] are not, however, specific dialects of a naturally evolved, and developmentally preconstituted 'capacity for art'. The existence of such a capacity is a figment of the Western imagination. And, as Gellner (1964: 12) has remarked, histories of humanity are often little more than histories of the West. The grand narratives of art do more to justify the present than provide any understanding of the 'past', or the 'Other'. And it</page><page sequence="3">South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 51 is archaeologists who often seek to discover the point at which these grand narratives began (Conkey &amp; Williams 1991). Rock art, in particular European Palaeolithic cave art, is crucial to archaeological narratives of the 'anatomically modern man', and their appearance at the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic. Cro-Magnons, or Homo sapiens, are said to be like us in a biological sense but not in a socio-cultural sense. Anatomically modern humans are supposedly biologically endowed with a variety of essential attributes (such as bipedalism, language and advanced cognitive abilities), attributes that are said to provide the capacity for culture. And it is the uniquely human capabilities of creative thought and expression that enables the production of a representational tradition of art. This idea of the anatomically modern man is crucial to Lewis-Williams's argument about the origins of art (Lewis Williams 2002, see also Lewis-Williams &amp; Pearce 2004a). Neanderthals, we are told, lacked a higher order of conscious ness. They also lacked a developed memory and modern language, consequently they were unable to act in any mean ingful way on visions experienced in an altered state of consciousness; they were unable to conceive of a spirit world. Neanderthal's "social and political distinctions were of the here-and-now and founded on sex, physical strength and age" (Lewis-Williams 2002: 285) - in other words they were animals. The arrival of 'anatomically modern people' into western Europe during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition facilitated a new kind of society there. This was because Cro-Magnon people had the higher order consciousness that Neanderthals lacked. They also had a developed memory and a modern language. As a result they were able to act on the hallucinations they experienced in trance, socialize these expe riences and develop a cosmology and a religion: a new, modern society. In a series of papers, Ingold challenges the very existence of an 'anatomically modern human': it is nothing more than "an analytic fiction" (2000: 373), conceived as the epitome of everything a human could be, a compendium of universal capacities abstracted from the manifold forms of life that have actually appeared in history, and retrojected onto the Palaeolithic past as a set of genetically inscribed, developmental potentials underwriting their real ization. Thus the course of history reappears as the progres sive unfolding of the latent capacities of our ancestors, biologically fixed in evolution even before history began (2000: 390). Since hominids are said to be anatomically modern at the start of the Upper Palaeolithic, any developments that have occurred since the start of the Upper Palaeolithic are then suggested to be a result of history, or cultural evolution, not biological evolution. That Cro-Magnons had the same capacity for language as we do today is a consequence of biological evolution, that they could not read or write is said to be a result of history. Contemporary arts and prehistoric arts are similarly separated by history: that Upper Palaeolithic people painted and engraved on cave walls and bits of bone, and Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel reflects a cultural develop ment of some genetic ability or predisposition to image making that can only be understood in socio-historical terms. Upper Palaeolithic people 'invented' art, and through countless generations those artistic techniques have been developed and perfected enormously, as outlined in the grand magisterial histories of art. In this fiction the primary difference between the Lascaux bulls and the painting of the Mona Lisa or Tracy Emin's unmade bed complete with used condoms, is a result of a more developed realization of innate potential in Leonardo da Vinci, and Tracy Emin, than Upper Palaeolithic painters. The history of art from Lascaux to the Louvre then is a story of the progressive unfolding of latent artistic capacities of our an cestors. Thus it is we can talk about the timeless nature of artis tic practice - from earliest times to the present. But, as Ingold (2000: 390) argues this distinction between history and evolution cannot be sustained - there is no place for one explanation (evolution) for how apes became human and another (history) to explain how humans, albeit some humans, became artists. The narrative of the history of art from Lascaux to the Louvre is then flawed from the outset. The differences between Upper Palaeolithic cave art and any creative tradition since, are not one of the realization of innate potential, but of skilful human beings engaging with their diverse environments in different ways. There is, therefore, no such thing as the origin of art; and shamanism has long since been used to provide a reality to this fiction I have just outlined (see, for example, Giedion 1962; Lommel 1967). WHAT IS SHAMANISM? 'Shamanism' is a construct, often said to be a framework, which works at two levels. At one level, it is a mythico-religious or cosmological construction of the environment in the context of trance rituals and beliefs, necessary for the reproduction of society in that environment. Shamanism then is a cultural construct, or a cosmology, of certain non-Western societies. At another level, however, it is a construct of Western intellectu als. A shaman (indigenous person) constructs his/her experi ences in terms of a shared system of beliefs (shamanism) the observer (Western academic) understands and is able to step back from this construction (culture) as one in many strikingly similar ways of understanding an independent reality (nature). Shamanism can only operate on these two different levels at once because there exists in Western thought two crucial divisions. The first is a division between humanity and nature and the second a division within humanity, that between indigenous peoples who live by culture and enlightened West erners who can see culture (shamanism) for what it is. These two divisions are underwritten by, according to Ingold (2000: 15), a belief in and a commitment to the "ascendancy of abstract or universal reason" . If humanity exists above nature by virtue of human beings' capacity for rational thought, then it is as a consequence of being able to develop fully this capacity that Western academics are in a position to place their knowledge of the world above that of people in 'other cultures' that are said to be mired in tradition, faith and illusion (Lewis-Williams 2002: 227). These dichotomies are a legacy of Enlightenment thought the principle element of which is an essential distinction between the body and the mind as seen in Cartesian philosophy. Although 'shamans' have fascinated the West since the time Herodotus was writing, it was not until the eighteenth century, through numerous accounts of journeys by botanists, geogra phers, missionaries, and other travellers of the period, that European interest in shamanism "became all-pervasive and extraordinarily intense" and came to "epitomize a grand confluence of ageless human activities the world over" (Flaherty 1992: 13). Just as archaeology was made possible by the emergence of Modernity (Thomas 1996: 12), so too was shamanism. For Latour (1993: 7), a key element in Modern thinking was the organization of the richness and diversity of human existence into discrete, definable entities. And shamanism was, I believe, one of those neatly packaged enti</page><page sequence="4">52 South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 ties. Gloria Flaherty (1992: 213) suggests that the "Enlighten ment was in part, at least, invented to rein in the ubiquitous vestiges of shamanic beliefs and practices ... to purge them from historical reportage". As the Enlightenment promoted the no tion of rational thought, the various practices that would even tually be described under the umbrella term 'shamanism' were neatly packaged, denigrated and banished to the irrational. But as enthnographic and, later, anthropological interest in shaman ism grew, it could only be re-accepted if it could be suitably or rigorously defined; attempts to provide a suitable definition of shamanism have played a prominent role in the shamanism/ rock art debate. The poetics of human existence was, and continues to be, reduced to something altogether more prosaic. Since my first discussions with Bushmen people about trance experiences and beliefs in 1989, 1 have been uneasy with the way in which 'shamanism' is used in rock art research. I have often stated, quite explicitly, that I believed the fundamental problem with the shamanism/rock art debate is not with shamanism per se, but with the way in which all parties in the debate have represented the concept of shamanism. To begin with, I believed the problems were methodological and socio-political (Dowson 1994b, 1996, 1999a, 2001a,b; see also Wallis 2002). I was only vaguely aware then there was more to it than that. Early European travellers' accounts, missionary reports, ethnographies from various centuries are replete with refer ences to trance rituals and associated beliefs. That these texts have to be examined in light of the social milieu in which they were written is beyond question (and such critical analyses do in fact exist). That these accounts report the existence of individuals who we now call 'shamans' and their trance and hallucinatory experiences is as unquestionable. But, there is something wrong with the 'textuality' of shamanistic interpre tations. I attempted, unsuccessfully I now feel, a different way of writing about the expression of shamanism in rock art (1998a, see also Dowson &amp; Porr 2001). That attempt was unsuc cessful because I did not go far enough in unpacking our essentialist notions of shamanism, an understanding that is based in Cartesian principles. I have come to realize we need to radically rethink 'shamanism' - not just attempt to provide a more suitable definition. A rethinking that must explore criti cally how the shaman operates within so-called 'indigenous' ontologies. Interestingly, the way in which rock art researchers discuss shamanism as either of the two constructs outlined above is strikingly different to recent discussions of animism in anthro pology and sociology (Harvey, 2006, provides a truly monu mental account of this). Rethinking animism has included, for example, Martin Stringer's (1999) study of how E.B. Tylor's use of animism has been consistently misread, Nurit Bird-David's (1999) reformulation of animism as a relational epistemology, and Morten Pedersen's (2001) constructions of animic and totemic modes of thought in North Asian ontologies. In this rethinking of animism there is an explicit move away from Enlightenment notions of 'nature', 'life' and personhood, an intellectual exercise that has yet to take place in rock art research. In fact, there has been very little theorizing about the shaman in rock art research. What we have all been guilty of is a reifica tion of a narrowly focused understanding of shamanism as an all-encompassing cosmology, producing humanity's earliest images. The recent research on animism shows a rethinking of shamanism as a concept for understanding rock art is not only long overdue, it is also possible. I now develop such a rethinking by examining four specific themes in the hunter-gatherer rock art of southern Africa. TRANCE OR SCENES OF DAILY LIFE Most rock arts, certainly those that are at the heart of the current interpretative deadlock, include imagery that appar ently depicts, or alludes to the daily activities of hunter gatherers. Images such as these have led scholars to propose somewhat mundane and rather simplistic meanings and motivations for these images specifically, and rock art generally. And it tends to be these images that are reproduced when rock arts are used to decorate contemporary material culture (Dowson 1995b, 1999b). In southern Africa, for example, the most common image that is reproduced in such contexts is the hunt scene, frequently fictitious (Dowson et al. 1994). These supposed depictions of daily activities, and their dispropor tionate reproduction in contemporary contexts, have been a significant factor in the reluctance to accept a religious/sym bolic interpretation of the art, an interpretation that focuses on the beliefs and experiences of shamans. In the context of south ern African rock art research, certain scholars could accept that some of the rock art was associated with trance rituals and beliefs, but the presence of 'scenes of daily life' ensured that a more straightforward interpretation of the art as depicting the day-to-day activities of hunter-gatherers would never be dismissed. The shamanistic interpretative framework, wherever it has been applied, has not been able to advance a convincing interpretation of these depictions - those interpretations that have been essayed are clumsy and cumbersome, but in most cases these depictions are expediently overlooked. But deal with them we must. I consider four painted images. The first (Fig. 1) appears to be a straightforward representation of a hunt: a man (he has a penis) drives an eland towards another human figure that is shooting arrows at the animal. The eland is in a rather awkward position, it has its neck lowered but its nose is raised. Eland adopt this posture when they have been pursued for a long time, because the nostrils fill with foam and blood, making it difficult to breathe. Contrary to widespread belief, and the impression one gets from popular re-productions, there are comparatively few depictions of humans actually engaged in hunting. In one valley of the Drakensberg Mountains, for instance, Harald Pager (1971) identified only 29 hunting scenes among 3909 individual paintings. Of those 29 hunt scenes only seven show men shooting at animals, and only one animal is depicted as having being hit by an arrow. But, there are many human figures depicted running, or walking perhaps, while carrying hunting equipment. The painting in Fig. 2 appears to depict the success of a hunting expedition. Here a procession of human figures, which most assume to be male, appear to be carrying small antelope that we can in all probability assume to be dead. One man has an animal thrown over his shoulder, while two other male figures show another way in which small buck are often carried - by tying the legs to a pole. The third painting (Fig. 3) appears to depict the daily activities generally assigned to women. In this example a procession of three women (two of them have breasts) carry sticks used to dig up edible roots. These sticks were sometimes weighted with a bored stone, and fixed in place on the stick with a wooden wedge. The women in this painting carry such weighted digging sticks. These three paintings (Figs 1-3) conform to stereotypical understandings of hunter-gatherers and their way of life - men hunt animals and women gather plant foods. And, that hunter-gatherers chose to paint such scenes is also easily understood given related stereotypical views about their lifestyle. As hunting and gathering are thought to be their only activities of necessity that occupy their daily routine, there is plenty of time to pursue creative endeavours such as painting</page><page sequence="5">South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 53 iEI., FIG. 1.

KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. these activities on the walls of their shelters (see, for example, Thompson 1990: 9). Interpretations of paintings like the one reproduced in Fig. 4 are based on an extension of these stereotypical views to accommodate changing historical circumstances in southern Africa over the last two thousand or so years. There are a number of paintings around South Africa that include animals (sheep, cattle and horses) and objects (iron spears, shields, wagons and ships) that are said to be indications of contact between indigenous hunter-gatherers and other incoming groups of people - namely pastoralists, farmers and Europeans. Just as once, in some utopian pre-contact period, hunter-gatherers painted idyllic scenes of daily life, paintings from post-contact times included depictions of events that record interactions hunter-gatherer people had with new arrivals, interactions that were often extremely violent. The painting reproduced here in Fig. 4 shows one such violent event, a poignant image with faithful attention to detail. For instance, on some horses the bridle is easily discernible, at least one horseman has a beard, and flashes from the rifles and even the flash from the pan of a flintlock rifle have also been included. Because of this striking attention to detail, this painting is generally said to depict an actual incident of a FIG. 3. A procession of women carrying weighted digging sticks.

Drakensberg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. mounted Boer commando attacking a band of Bushmen, caught red-handed, as it were, with stolen cattle (Pager 1975: 112; Vinnicombe 1976: 24-28; Wilcox 1984: 200). Bushmen are indeed reported to have carried out raids on European farmers' livestock, and commandos were sent after them (Wright 1971; Vinnicombe 1976: 9-108; Dowson 1995a), so it seems natural enough to assume such events would be painted. Given paintings such as the four I have just described (Figs 1-4), it is perhaps understandable that images like these are thought to be representations of activities in the daily lives of the peoples who made them. In fact, in some instances, such as the procession of women with digging sticks (Fig. 3), such a view seems incontrovertible. But this cannot be said of all such depictions. A number of researchers (Campbell 1986, 1987; Manhire et al. 1986; Hall 1986, 1994; Yates et al. 1993; Loubser &amp;</page><page sequence="7">South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 55 Laurens 1994) have examined closely paintings generally thought to have been made by hunter-gatherers after their contact with herders, farmers and Europeans. These scholars argue that new peoples on the landscapes resulted in new opportunities and new sources of conflict, which were incorpo rated into the symbolic work of shamans, and were thus reflected in the rock art. The painting of the Boer attack on Bushmen, for example, not only shows men on horseback shooting at fleeing Bushmen, there is also a 'non-real' human figure in the upper right hand edge of the panel. The figure has an exaggerated penis and a scrotum, is bleeding from the nose, and it has two long emanations from its head and a tail. These features indicate that this figure is a shaman transformed in altered states of consciousness (Campbell 1986: 262-264). The presence of the shaman figure in this apparently graphic narrative is discussed in terms of the changing nature of shamans' symbolic work following contact with new peoples. One of the shamans' tasks was to cure the sick, and for the Bushmen sickness was both biological and social. These activities were depicted in the rock paintings. The arrival of new peoples into southern Africa resulted in a whole new set of social circum stances, out of which new forms of social and physical conflict arose. Not surprisingly San people turned to their shamans to alleviate these new tensions. And, it is equally understandable that the people painting images such as these should have depicted their shamans' attempts to deal with the changing, often violent, social circumstances the San people found them selves in. So, the depiction reproduced here in Fig. 4 cannot simply be thought of as a representation, no matter how detailed or narrative-like it is, of an actual event - the presence of the shaman figure argues against such a superficial interpretation. But what of the hunt scene represented here in Fig. 1? It appears to be a straightforward representation of a hunt scene. Again, the shamanistic interpretative approach has challenged such a reading. When a San shaman enters trance, it is said he or she has 'died' - trance itself is often called 'little death' or 'half death'. The shaman 'dying' in trance shares certain behavioural characteristics with eland that are dying as a result of being chased and shot by a poisoned arrow. They both tremble, stagger about, sweat profusely, lower their heads, froth at the mouth and bleed from the nose, and, finally, collapse unconscious. Shamans also believe they become animals in trance. The trans formation into an animal is in fact one of the most frequently reported hallucinatory experiences of deeper stages of altered states of consciousness. In one such report a person said: I thought of a fox, and instantly I was transformed into that animal. I could distinctly feel myself a fox, could see my long ears and bushy tail, and by a sort of introversion felt that my complete anatomywas that of a fox. (Siegel &amp;Jarvik 1975: 105). There are numerous paintings that show human/animal figures with various combinations of human and animal features, the so-called therianthropes. There are many depic tions in which these therianthropic figures are juxtaposed with dying eland or antelope. Dying animals then have a symbolic significance - they do not simply represent the physical death of the animal, they also recall the 'death' of the shaman. And in a direct comment on the hunt scene in Fig. 1, Lewis-Williams and I wrote, "often one cannot be sure if one is looking at a 'real' dying eland or at a metaphorical depiction of a 'dying' shaman" (Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1989: 53). It is interpreta tions like this that scholars, even those who are broadly sympa thetic with the shamanistic approach, find problematic. The interpretation Lewis-Williams and I offered for the hunt scene (Fig. 1) does give the impression that any depiction can be interpreted in terms of shamanic experiences and beliefs; if not now, eventually. On this point, it is Mathias Guenther (1999: 234-235) who is perhaps the most diplomatic: "The decision as to the trance component of one or another representation is deemed by some to be arbitrary and is the key element in what has become one of the most enduring and interesting contro versies in Khoisan expressive culture." So while most are pre pared to accept a shamanistic interpretation for the Boer attack on Bushmen in Fig. 4, the hunt scene in Fig. 1 is an uncompli cated representation of two men involved in hunting down an eland. And so an interpretative impasse: the hunt scene then is either a candid representation of humanity's interaction with nature or it results from cultural constructions of nature. Both are wide of the mark, I now argue. BEING IN THE WORLD Both of these interpretative positions are informed, albeit with a different emphasis, by a Cartesian view of the world which sees a distinction between nature and culture. This view suggests that humans, unlike animals, exist in the world on two levels: the social level and the natural level - humans are both persons and organisms. Animals on the other hand are only organisms - they exist in the world as material entities to be killed and consumed by humans and other organisms, and they only exist in culturally constructed worlds where they have been reinterpreted as anthropomorphic beings (theri anthropes being a classic example). So the hunt scene is either just that - a routine activity associated with the procurement of food - or it is, in the context of a shamanistic interpretation, or Thackeray's (1994, 2005a,b) notion of 'sympathetic control', the product of a cultural construct of southern African hunter gatherers that afforded meaning and significance to nature, and enabled these people to make sense of and live in the world. For Parkington (2003, but see also Parkington et al. 1996), who offers a competing interpretation based on the rock art from the south western Cape, the eland is a metaphor for the birth of the hunter rather than the death of the shaman. Parkington suggests "hunting means the killing of a large game animal such as an eland and eland form the basis of an extended metaphor that links food to sex" (Parkington 2003: 144, original emphasis) and "no animal more effectively embodies the system of understanding the world than the eland, or equivalent large game animal. No activity more effectively problematizes the differences between people and animals and between men and women than does hunting" (2003: 146). This position is no different, in principle, to the way in which animals are located in San expressive culture by the shamanistic interpretation; in his attempts to interpret rock paintings Parkington has merely substituted one set of metaphors for another, while relying on the same fictitious dichotomy between nature and culture. In all these positions the animal is denied any intentionality and agency, or personhood. But this is not how hunter-gatherers perceive their relationships with animals - including hunter-gatherers of southern Africa. I do not believe, any longer, that the hunt scene represents a graphic metaphor of a 'dying' shaman, or any other system of metaphors that make sense of the world either. And it is not a straightforward depiction of a hunting event. Rather, it reveals an interpersonal dialogue between two sentient beings in the world: human and non-human animal. Hunting for hunter gatherers is not simply about the procurement of food, it is world-renewing, it is a skilled way of engaging with the world</page><page sequence="8">56 South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 -II FIG. 5. A couple said to be engaged in sexual intercourse. Drakensberg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. that ensures the circulation of supernatural forces (see Ingold 2000; see also Descola 1992, 1996; Harvey 2006). The hunted provides food and sustenance, while the hunter ensures he and his community behaves respectfully towards this act of giving. Even a superficial reading of southern African hunter-gatherer ethnography reveals this is as true for them as it is for any other hunter-gatherer. So-called avoidance behav iours associated with the hunt are extensively documented for the San. The presence of these actions suggests, as Guenther (1988: 198) points out, that "activated in each hunt is a feeling of sympathy, and the implicit recognition that the animal is a moral and sentient kindred being" . The hunt scene reproduced here in Fig. 1 reveals this engagement between human and non-human animals, both engaged in the regeneration of life forces. Many hunter-gatherer groups around the world see a parallel between hunting and sexual intercourse and marriage (for the San see Lewis-Williams 1981a; Biesele 1993; for the Cree see Ingold 2000: 13,67). Both activities can be thought of as rites of regeneration: "consumption follows killing as birth follows intercourse, and both acts are integral to the reproductive cycles, respectively, of animals and humans" (Ingold 2000: 67; see also Descola 1992, 1996). In southern African rock art, there are about as many known explicit depictions of sexual inter course (Fig. 5, see also Vinnicombe 1976: 247), perhaps more, than there are known explicit depictions of hunts. And, like hunting, the gathering of plant foods (Fig. 3) is another way in which humans (and non-human animals) engage with the world in which they live, it is a skilled activity that is also carried out with respect. Gathering involves a person moving about in the world, exploring it, being attentive to it and ever alert to the signs in it. Just as hunting involves a dialogue between the hunted, the hunter and the landscape, so too gatherers enter into an interpersonal dialogue with the landscape. Hunting and gathering are not mundane tasks associated with the procurement of food; they are activities that are intimately associated with the regeneration of supernatural forces. And it is into this way of being in the world that the work of the shaman must be understood. The so-called shamanistic interpretation of southern African hunter-gatherer rock art has more than adequately demonstrated how the activities of shamans are associated with the regeneration of supernatural forces. Shamans, variously, attempt to cure the sick (both biological and social ills), and control the game and the rain. But those of us working within the shamanistic interpretative framework have thus far suggested the rock engravings and rock paintings were exclusively associated with shamans' symbolic work on social relations and the reproduction of nature (see, for example, Lewis-Williams 1981a, 1982,1984; Campbell 1986,1987; Deacon 1988, 1994; Dowson 1994a, 1995a, 1998b; Ouzman 1996, 1998; Blundell 2004; Lewis-Williams &amp; Pearce 2004a,b; etc., etc.). Some writers may have been more circumspect than others, but in all it was only ever the shamans by virtue of their trance activities who were responsible for the regeneration of the world - never hunters and gatherers by virtue of their hunting and gathering activities, and certainly never non-human animals. If the dying eland was linked to the 'dying' shaman, it is because the dying animal was simply a metaphor for the 'dying' shaman; not because in death, real or trance, both the eland and the shaman were involved in maintaining the circulation of supernatural forces. The significance of death and hunting, was not metaphorical, it was very real, and essen tial for the regeneration of life. And it is the significance of these activities, those of shamans, hunters, gatherers, and animals, that are revealed in the hunter-gatherer rock art of southern Africa, and, I would argue, beyond. The active and intentional way in which both humans and non-human animals engage with the world together, and leave revelations of this engagement, can be best illustrated at a rock engraving site reported and discussed extensively by Sven Ouzman (1996, see also 2001). Thaba Sione is a complex rock-engraving site in the North West Province of South Africa. Ouzman recorded some 559 identifiable engraved images, but it is the depiction of rhinoceroses (the most frequently and richly depicted animal at this particular location) that he believes provides the site with a conceptual focus and pre eminence. This focus centred on rhinoceros potency and certain elements of San shamanism - specifically, but not exclu sively, rain-making. San shamans were believed to be able to control the rain (Vinnicombe 1976: 323-344; Schmidt 1979; Lewis-Williams 1981a: 103-115; Dowson 1998b; Lewis-Williams &amp; Pearce 2004b). Very briefly, in some rituals it is said that the shamans would drag the rain-animal (said to be a hippopotamus, eland, cow, or a strange combination thereof) out of a water hole and lead it up into the sky, where they would cut its skin and the blood would fall as rain. Drawing on the substantial southern African ethnography of rain-making, Ouzman has convincingly shown that at least some of the rhinoceros depictions at this site almost certainly negotiated rain-making beliefs. Such beliefs he argues would also have been based on the behaviour of rhinoceros at Thaba Sione. Surrounding the hill on which the engravings were made are 27 large, standing stones that have been rubbed smooth by rhinoceros over a considerable period of time. Some of these stones have had engravings added to them at a later time. Rhinoceros wallow in muddy waterholes, cover them selves in mud, and then rub themselves against robust standing stones in an attempt to remove ectoparasites from their skin (Smithers 1983: 560-564). The movement of these animals from the waterholes to the hill was interpreted as a "visible expression of [shamans'] control over, and ownership of, a spirit world resource" (Ouzman 1996: 58). Places have a "history, sedimented layers of meaning by</page><page sequence="9">South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 57 FIG. 6. A painting of a trance dance, eastern Free State, South Africa. virtue of actions and events that take place in them" (Tilley 1994: 27). The obviously real presence of the rhinoceros and the engravings made thereafter are two such 'events' in the biography of Thaba Sione. But I take a less culturally construc tionist view of the relationship between those events. San shamans did not observe the behaviour of rhinoceroses at Thaba Sione and appropriate it spiritually within the terms of an imposed set of cultural beliefs about rain-making to make that place culturally, spiritually and politically significant. All engagements within a new or familiar place are constituted by the history of that place - San peoples' (not only shamans') engagement with Thaba Sione was intimately bound up in the dialogue rhinoceroses also had with the place. The human act of engraving involves removing (pecking, incising or scraping) the outer skin of the rock to expose the inner, unweathered rock that makes the depictions stand out. Sometimes these en graved depictions were then rubbed smooth. And there are also instances where humans have rubbed smooth certain patches on the rock surface. This is exactly what the rhinocer oses were doing - their rubbing against the standing stones re moved the outer skin to expose inner rock - to make a fresh surface. Rubbing the rock surface was as intentional for the hu mans (Yates &amp; Manhire 1991; Dowson 1992; Ouzman 2001) as it was for the non-human animals. Today we draw a distinction between the patches of rock rubbed smooth by humans and rhinoceroses. I suggest this distinction is unnecessary or insignificant. These 'rubbings', and all the engravings, are the physical reminders of humans' and non-humans' knowledgeable engagements in the world. Rubbing the rock for humans was implicated in shamans' rain-making and curing activities. Rubbing the rock for rhinoceroses was also implicated in maintaining their well being. These are similar activities, with similar physical out comes, for similar reasons. In hunter-gatherer world views supernatural forces circulate freely amongst constituents of the environment, human and non-human, animate and inanimate. The continuity of the living world depends on the circulation of these life forces, and both humans and non-human animals take responsibility for maintaining that circulation. If we are correct in speculating that rubbing the rock for humans, and, as I have demonstrated, for animals, is about ensuring the circula tion of supernatural potency, at Thaba Sione, then the ongoing dialogue between humans, non-humans and place is founded on coactive attempts to ensure the continued circulation of supernatural forces. And it is this idea that I believe is at the heart of southern African hunter-gatherer rock art. NARRATIVE VERSUS PERFORMATIVITY Until now I have taken for granted the binary distinction between male and female. I now bring my examination of specific depictions to a close by developing my discussion of specific themes of hunter-gatherer rock art, with the use of one final painted image (Fig. 6), in relation to one further aspect of that rock art, another aspect that features prominently in the shamanism/rock art debate in southern Africa. In this example six women are depicted standing, and holding what are most probably flywhisks. Other humans, probably also women, appear to be lying down, one of whom could very well be bleeding from the nose. The white line around the group is reminiscent of other painted lines around unequivocal trance</page><page sequence="10">58 South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 dance scenes (see Lewis-Williams 1981b; Dowson 1988a; Lewis-Williams et al. 2000). This painting and others like it, that appear to highlight the depiction of women as opposed to men, have been used to explore gender relations in southern African rock art (see, for example, Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1989: 46-47; Stevenson 1995; Solomon 1992, 1994, 1998; Ouzman 1997). The problem with studies like these is that they adopt not just a normative approach to gender, but a heteronormative one (for more on heteronormativity in rock art research specifi cally see Dowson 2000b, 2001a, and in archaeology more gener ally, see Dowson 2006). Heteronormative approaches to gender are greatly influenced by a Cartesian philosophy, in which the categorical distinctions between body and mind, nature and culture are extended to sex and gender. In the context of southern African rock art research then, the San human being is a stable, biological entity, a sexed body - male/female, onto which cultural constructions of gender are added (see Dowson 1988b; Ouzman 1997). For some time now scholars from a variety of intellectual and disciplinary positions have argued quite convincingly against the idea of 'male' and 'female' as essential biological categories of sex/gender (for one, very readable account, see Fausto-Sterling 2000). The approach I have drawn on for the new direction I propose here, in which a human being is defined in terms of being in the world, is very much in line with Judith Butler's (1990, 1993) theory of gender performativity. For Butler, categories of gender, particularly male versus female, do not adequately account for a person's identity, performativity is a process through which a person is consti tuted (for a review of the use of performativity in recent archae ological research, see Perry &amp; Joyce 2001, but see also Fowler 2000). In quantitative analyses of rock art imagery, there is a wide spread tendency to classify human figures as male or female by the presence of genitalia or breasts. In some instances, where these are absent, the human figure can be identified as male or female by associated material objects. For example, in southern Africa a human figure holding a bow and/or arrows is accepted to be male: 'male by bow' (Vinnicombe 1967). Human figures without primary or secondary means of identification are 'indeterminate'. In Fig. 6 only six of the 14 human figures can be identified in this way, they are women. But, and quite signifi cantly, eight human figures are indeterminate. In fact the vast majority of human figures in southern African rock art are supposedly unidentifiable. This is most obvious in two differ ent study areas of the southeastern mountains: Vinnicombe (1976) found that 89% of the figures are indeterminate, whereas Lewis-Williams (1981a) found that 72.5% of the human figures he analysed were unidentifiable. Similar results have been obtained from other regions in southern Africa since. If southern African rock art 'tells' us anything about gender, it is that the historically and politically specific notions of male and female based on primary sex features are at best misleading, but more probably entirely irrelevant. What is immediately discernable is not Western constructs of gender but activity. In Fig. 6 it is not femaleness in opposition to male ness that mattered, but rather the performativity of individuals. Activities, such as healing, dancing, gathering or hunting, were not simply actions people performed, they were processes of engagement through which those people depicted in the rock art were constituted. It is precisely because we think about activities as straightforward actions, a man hunts while a woman gathers, as opposed to processes that are both constitutive of and constituted by engagement, that today we see the painted scenes I have been examining in this paper as (graphic) narratives. They are not narratives of daily routine, they are embodied revelations of personal engagements with the world; engagements through which each human and non-human animal sought to maintain the circulation of vital forces. A SHIFT IN EMPHASIS OR A NEW DIRECTION? I have outlined above what I believe to be a more appropriate approach to the hunter-gatherer rock art of southern Africa, and probably elsewhere. For some readers, my continued discussion of shamans and their trance experiences and beliefs will suggest that this represents nothing more than a shift in emphasis, rather than a new direction. If the last two decades of research on southern African rock art has shown us anything, it is that no one can deny the presence of graphic depictions of the trance experiences and beliefs of shamans. The problem with the shamanistic approach is not that shamans did not exist, but that 'shamanism' is said to be the overriding cosmol ogy that determined what got painted and engraved, and how. This is best demonstrated in Eastwood's recent account of painted Kudu from the central Limpopo Basin (2006). Relying on Lewis-Williams's ideas about focused polysemy (1998, 2001), Eastwood suggests that paintings depicting puberty rites are "shamanistic" (as opposed to 'shamanic', a spurious distinc tion created by others to justify the monolithic interpretative strategy of the shamanistic approach) because puberty rites also engage supernatural forces (Shostak 1981: 149). But, it does not follow that because both puberty rites and trance rituals engage supernatural potency that images of these can all be termed 'shamanistic', even when taking into account the ex pediency of 'focused polysemy' or the shamanic/shamanistic distinction. What Eastwood has so compellingly demonstrated is how hunter-gatherer rock art can and does include quite different themes. The idea that 'shamanism' permeates all aspects of daily life for the San is not universally accepted by anthropologists who have worked in the Kalahari (see Guenther 1994: 267-269). Because supernatural potency is thought to be everywhere, from healing dances and puberty rituals, animals and plants, swarming bees and the rain, to the vapour trail of a jet plane, tape recorders and travelling in a truck at high speed (Lee 1984: 109; Marshall 1999), it does not follow that shamanism perme ates all aspects of daily life. While shamans do activate super natural potency, and attempt to control it for the good of their community, supernatural potency is not the exclusive preserve of the shaman. Also, the way in which Barnard (1988) and Guenther (1999) have long since characterized San religion is diametrically opposed to the way in which Lewis-Williams and others (myself included) have constructed a shamanistic cosmology for the San. San religion can be said to be deeply ambiguous and fluid; these are not words that could be used to describe the standardized and uniform shamanistic cosmology ascribed to the San. Mindful of this, I have demonstrated here that the art did not centre exclusively on the work of shamans and their attempts to renew the world, as is the current domi nant story. In this narrative other activities, such as sexual inter course and hunting (not yet gathering, but it would only have been a matter of time), are said to be linked metaphorically to shamans' exclusive control over the world. The current shamanistic approach is founded on Cartesian distinctions between mind and body, nature and culture. In such a view of the world rock engravings and paintings are graphic metaphorical representations of a cultural construc tion of nature. I do not believe these Cartesian distinctions exist, but more importantly, I do not believe hunter-gatherers</page><page sequence="11">South African Archaeological Bulletin 62 (185): 49-61, 2007 59 think/thought like this either. The approach I suggest we inves tigate further is fundamentally different to the shamanistic approach, and this is explicable in at least the following two specific points: * Painted and engraved images do not graphically represent metaphors of trance experiences and beliefs. The dying eland is not a metaphor for a 'dying' shaman. Images of dying eland, or any other animals for that matter, are just that: images of dying animals whose engagement with the world ensures the continued flow of supernatural forces. And by depicting such images the painters revealed a deeper understanding of the continuous flow of supernatural forces; the dissolution of animate forms enables their generation elsewhere. * The engagements of shamans with the world are not privileged over those of other humans and non-human animals. The manipula tion of supernatural forces, as Eastwood rightly reminds us, is not the exclusive preserve of shamans, and there is no reason to assume that where 'supernatural forces' are implicated we are dealing with a 'shamanistic cosmology'. While images that reveal the work of shamans in their attempts to maintain the circulation of life forces do exist, and these might be more frequent in certain areas than in others, southern African rock art cannot be termed 'shamanistic'. Humans and non-human animals, shamans, hunters and gatherers, mothers and fathers, and their children, were all sentient beings, who in their day-to-day engagements with each other and the landscape in which they lived were intimately and actively involved in world-renewing activities. And those activities included hunting, gathering, sexual inter course, and trancing, to identify a few. The painted and engraved images we see on the rock surfaces of southern Africa, certainly those we can ascribe to hunter-gatherers, reveal a world in which both human and non-human beings actively engaged with one another, and the manifold attempts of these beings to ensure the circulation of supernatural forces that kept the animic system going. This is not to imply, how ever, that just because all humans and non-human animals are embedded in a network of intimate relations that everyone will be respectful and act towards one another appropriately. As Graham Harvey (2006: 149) suggests, rules of etiquette (avoidance behaviours, etc.) exist and are made explicit because they are not always followed, they are not natural or instinctive. Revealing intimate relations on the rock face, the engagements between various human and non-human beings, and using constituents from the world to make these revela tions, was itself another form of engagement that contributed to maintaining the continuous flow of supernatural life forces. Humans may be unique in their abilities to make depictions of such engagements with the world (although the rhinoceros rubbed rocks at Thaba Sione challenges such a Eurocentric and technicist view of image-making), but they are only able to do so by engaging with the constituents of their world, not because of some innate capacity for making art.
