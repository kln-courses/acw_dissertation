<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Evolution of Urban Society: Early Mesopotamia and Prehistoric Mexico. By ROBERT McC. ADAMS. Chicago: Aldine Publishing Co., 1966. From the point of view of the history of civilization, this little book, the work of a scholar with a superb anthropological train- ing and background as well as intimate knowledge and understanding of the arche- ology, history, and culture of Ancient Meso- potamia, may well turn out to be a minor classic. The author's underlying aim is to demonstrate the thesis that even in case of "the most complex and creative of human societies," social behavior conforms to a limited number of social laws. To achieve this goal, he utilizes the comparative method-the hallmark of anthropology as a discipline-to discover, isolate, and describe the regularities and similarities in the emer- gence and structure of two independent urban societies, those of early Mesopotamia and prehispanic Central Mexico. He thus comes to the conclusion that in spite of their vast separation in time and space, they are actually regional, specialized variants of a single "processual" pattern, and that there- fore, in the study of "civilized" societies, it is genuinely useful "to proceed at times from a generalizing comparative stance rather than exclusively from a contractive and compart- mentalizing one." The first chapter, "The Problem and the Evidence," begins not inappropriately with a brief discriminating survey of some of the views of the earlier anthropologists relating to the problem of the emergence of political states: Lewis Morgan's outmoded "linear" cultural evolution; Gordon Childe's "Urban Revolution" with its potential distortions and drawbacks; Julian Steward's cultural "core," "a nexus of basic institutions and relationships," with its misplaced emphasis on ecological adaptation as the primary source of change; Braidwood and Willey's "step" and "ramp" metaphors for the rate and duration of the "interrelated web of changes" that constitute the Urban Revolu- tion. The author then goes on to develop his reasons for selecting Mesopotamia and Central Mexico-and not, for example, Egypt and the Andean area-for his comparative study: these two regions are least likely to have any genetic interconnections due to cultural diffusion; they represent "pristine" urban states "that developed sui generis out of purely local conditions"; in spite of their divergent geographical features, they are "closely comparable in terms of population potential, degree of political centralization and urbanization"; the span of time it took them to develop from agricultural settlements to expansionist urban states is approximately the same for both regions-about a millen- nium and a half; both have a considerable amount of written records, "textual" in the case of Mesopotamia1 and contextual in the case of Mexico. Needless to say, however, the quantity of the available source material is far from adequate, and its interpretation is riddled with difficulties. The entire remainder of the chapter is therefore devoted to a closely argued, detailed analysis of the nature of the data and its limitations and pitfalls. In fact 1 In the course of the excellent overview and evalu- ation of the Mesopotamian and Mesoamerican written evidence (pp. 31 ff.), we find the observation: "Still a further common limitation within which the his- torian must work in both Mesopotamia and Meso- america is the narrowness and somewhat arbitrary quality of what Leo Oppenheim (1960) has termed the recorded 'stream of tradition.' " Whatever the merits of the term "stream of tradition" as applied to Mesopotamian written sources-and there are reasons to doubt both its accuracy and adequacy-it refers primarily to the clay documents discovered in the Ashurbanipal library of the first millennium B.C. For the purposes of a study dealing with Early Meso- potamia, however, it is the much earlier literary material dating from 2500-1700 B.c.--i.e. the works from which the "stream of tradition" gradually emerged-that is essential, and, limited as it may be, it is of inestimable value for the understanding of all aspects of Mesopotamian urban society (cf. also note 13). 326</page><page sequence="2">BoOK REVIEWS 327 the author does such a persuasive, thorough- going job of denigrating the available source material that the reader is somewhat taken by surprise on reading the rather optimistic summation "this is not an admission of defeat, but only a statement of difficulties." In any case, the character of the problem thoroughly ventilated, and the complexity and ambiguity of the evidence fully demon- strated, the reader is now well prepared to evaluate and appreciate "the broad similar- ities" between the Mexican and Mesopota- mian societies, and thus recognize that they are "essentially parallel examples of a par- ticular type of development in a multi- linear evolutionary framework." The second chapter, "Subsistence and Settlement," begins with a detailed com- parison of the role played by the "Food- Producing Revolution"-a "process," be it stressed, and not an "event"-in Mesopo- tamia and Mesoamerica. In both cases it led to a greater aggregate of leisure time, popu- lation growth, stability of residence, agri- cultural surplus in the form of deployable wealth. The second half of the chapter an- alyzes the similarities in the "composite" character of the subsistence patterns of the two regions: the involvement of specialized groups of producers2 and the "mediation" of their relationship by some dominant insti- tution, such as the temple and palace;3 the increasing intensity of land cultivation, par- ticularly through irrigation, that stimulated the concentration of hereditable wealth and the emergence of a class-stratified society. Especially noteworthy is the illuminating analysis of the agricultural and pastoral economy of early Mesopotamia as revealed in the enigmatic textual sources (pp. 55-61), as well as the penetrating treatment of the nature of the Mesopotamian and Meso- american irrigation systems and the role they played in the "encouragement of new eco- nomic resources and social complexity" (pp. 67-76). 2 The assertion on p. 49 "that the great early centers of the cult of the shepherd-god, Dumuzi, lay in cities bordering the Sumerian edin or "pasturing ground" is highly speculative, and carries little con- viction in spite of its seeming reasonableness. Ac- cording to numerous Sumerian texts, for example, Dumuzi is at home in Eridu, a city that can hardly qualify as bordering on the edin. As yet we know very little of the origin and development of the Dumuzi cult; its complexity and intricacy, however, preclude a simple logical explanation of the kind implied in the cited passage. 3 The view that the institution of the market place was largely or entirely absent in the early cities of Mesopotamia (pp. 52-53) follows that generally taken for granted by students of Mesopotamian history and culture. To my mind, however, this surmise, based largely on negative evidence-the total absence of specific market-place documents-is quite unjustified. The fact that market-place records have not been found is no proof whatever that a market place did not exist in the Early Mesopotamian towns and cities-it is absurd to assume that the day-to-day "bazaar" buying and selling transactions would be recorded on tablets. On the other hand, here are several texts pointing to the existence of a market economy and market place in early Mesopotamia: In the Urukagina reform documents (cf. The Sum- erians, pp. 317-22) we find that shepherds were re- quired to pay silver to the palace for sheep-shearing; that a shublugal could say to his supervisor who wanted to buy his donkey, or to a "big man" who wanted to buy his house: "Weigh out for me the silver pleasing to my heart" (that is "Pay me as much as I think fair"); a man who divorced his wife had to pay five shekels of silver to the ensi and one shekel to the chief steward. Now where would these people get silver shekels, or what would they use them for, if there were not a money economy and a market place where merchandise could be bought and sold (note that while the shepherd and the "supervisor" may have been temple officials and therefore presumably received monthly rations from the temple, "silver" is never mentioned as part of these rations, and they must therefore have obtained it privately in one way or another)? And if we turn to only a century or two later than the Akkadian period we find the Ur- Nammu "law-code" describing the poor man as "a man of one shekel," and the rich man as "a man of one mina," terms that clearly indicate the prev- alence of money and market economy. Roughly from this same period we learn of the actual existence of a public square where both young lovers and school- boys would be tempted to linger, and where no doubt wares and pleasures of one sort or another could be purchased for a price (cf. e.g. The Sumerians, pp. 244-45 and 254). To be sure the tablets inscribed with these texts date from the first half of the second millennium, but there is good reason to conclude that the compositions go back to about 2000 B.c., and that they may even reflect a much earlier urban situation. In fact, a priori, as a matter of common sense, it is hardly likely that the citizens of the Early Meso- potamian towns and cities would run to the temple or palace for their daily needs; it seems much more reasonable to assume that "bazaars" of one kind or another existed throughout Early Mesopotamia. Un- fortunately it is unlikely that archeology will ever speak out with certainly on this point; it is rather improbable that the excavator would be able to rec- ognize and identify an early Mesopotamian "bazaar" should he come upon one.</page><page sequence="3">328 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES "Kin and Class," the third chapter in the book, is devoted primarily to a comparison of social and class stratification, "the main- spring and foundation" of political society, as it developed in the two regions.4 Following a sober, up-to-date treatment of the relevant textual material for Mesopotamia, it pro- ceeds to demonstrate that the elementary units from which the Early Dynastic Meso- potamian urban society as well as that of late prehistoric Central Mexico were built up, consisted of "traditional, localized groupings composed of related nuclear families." Turning next to social and class stratification, the chapter continues with a penetrating, comprehensive analysis of the Mesopo- tamian evidence, both archeological and epigraphic, and concludes that Mesopotamian society, like that of Mesoamerica, was on the whole rather rigidly stratified: princely families at the top,5 in possession of manorial estates of various size, a large class of labor- clients dependent in one way or another upon these "noble" estates, a small but by no means insignificant slave population;6 both societies, moreover, still had kin-related communities more or less independent of the princely elite.7 The formation of a class society is vitally related to the development of the political state, the subject of the fourth chapter of the book, "Parish and Polity." First, in both societies, came the "priests," that is, "an elite whose claim to leadership was primarily validated on religious grounds," for in both Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica, the indica- tions are that religion and religious forms of expression were intense, omnipresent, and all-embracing.8 There follows a comparative analysis of the religious phenomena common to both regions: their anthropomorphic pantheon,9 the building of monumental temples, and the similarities in their activi- 4 I am inclined to the opinion that for Mesopotamia Morgan's stress on private property as characteristic of the emergence of urban society is more to the point that the author's emphasis on stratified social rela- tions (cf. pp. 79-80); in this respect it differs signifi- cantly from its Mesoamerican counterpart. 5 For the aristocratic military character of the ruling princely class in Early Mesopotamia compare, e.g., chap. 24 of my History Begins at Sumer. 6 The statement on p. 102 that male slaves are generally referred to as igi-nu-du, "the blind ones," is somewhat misleading-the igi-nu-du is but one category of slaves, utilized in the kind of field labor-- drawing water from a well, for example-for which sight was not essential. There is little doubt that mutilation of slaves, such as blinding or cutting off the ears, was practiced in Early Mesopotamia, pri- marily no doubt, as a means of forestalling the possi- bility of escape, but it is hardly likely that all, or even the majority of, slaves were so impaired. 7 For Mesopotamia, there is reason to conclude that "kin-related" communities played little, if any, role in its urban society (the rendering of im-ru-a as lineage or clan in the contexts referred to on p. 85, is far from assured). On the other hand, as early as the days of Eannatum, a century or so before the be- ginning of the Akkadian period, the inhabitants of Umma, for example, are called "the men of Umma," while in the Urukagina texts, the Lagashites are designated as "sons of Lagash" (cf. The Sumerians, pp. 319 and 321); that is, people were identified as citizens of this or that city, and not with a clan or some other kin-related group. Nor is there any reason to assume that this was an innovation in the time of Eannatum or Urukagina-it may well go back to considerably earlier times. In fact it is not unlikely that a sense of citizenship-city-pride and patriotism -was a significant feature of Mesopotamian society that differentiated it from that of Mesoamerica. 8 While it is true that Mesopotamian urban society like that of Mesoamerican was theocratically or- iented, the indications are that in the case of the former, the role of the temple, and religion as a whole, in the daily life of the citizens, has been greatly exaggerated by earlier scholars (not a few of whom came from religious backgrounds), as a result of the one-sided nature of the evidence (cf. e.g. The Sumer- ians, pp. 75 ff.). The people living in the early Sumerian cities were probably not much more religious, or religion dominated, than those of the Medieval cities of Western Europe, and even the vast land holdings of the temples were probably not much larger, relatively speaking, than those of the Medieval church. In fact while it is true that religious ideas and practices pervaded Mesopotamian life, gave it mean- ing and perspective, and were responsible in large part for the Mesopotamian creative effort in art and architecture, music and literature, they did not lead to the irrational, obsessive compulsions that char- acterized other ancient peoples and societies, including that of Mesoamerica. 9 Even if the name of the goddess Inanna has nothing to do with ripening dates, and if the name Dumuzi turns out to mean "true son" rather than "he who quickens the young ones," it is probably true that "the earliest conceptions of deity to crystallize were those associated with the assurance of fertility and the annual regeneration of crops and livestocks" (p. 122). But it is quite as likely that the belief in a tutelary deity for each town and city was also an early development in Mesopotamian religious thought, and this again would point to the importance attached to place rather than kin in Mesopotamian urban society (cf. note 7).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 329 ties and organization.10 In both societies, moreover, there was a parallel gradual trans- formation from an essentially theocratic authority to a more secular, politically oriented government, culminating in the institution of hereditary kingship and in expansionist militarism that ushered in the establishment of empire-size political units."1 As even this brief, summary sketch of its contents shows, The Evolution of Urban Society is an imaginative, original contribu- tion to an understanding of the history and character of man's cultural evolution: dis- cerning, discriminating, and scrupulous in methodology, judicious and authoritative in its conclusions. Lest this review turn into a panegyric, however, let me note several aspects of the study that seem to me debat- able and inadequate. First, there is the matter of style-the writing tends to be stilted, labored, and ponderous. It may be that the repeated use of such high-sounding words as "conceptualization," "adumbrate," "sym- biosis," and "extrapolate," not to mention a number of rather grating, turgid phrases and sentences, are essential to anthropologi- cal and "scientific" precision, but there is considerable room to doubt the validity of this view. After all the author himself does not disdain the use of such "poetic" devices as alliteration in his choice of chapter-titles, or in the use of such metaphors as "ramp," and "step" to describe the "paradigms" of early urban growth; or a dramatic simile such as "chorus" and "central protagonists" (p. 120). Quite debatable, too, is the assertion (p. 174) that the differences between the Meso- potamian and Mesoamerican societies are extremely small in bulk in proportion to the similarities. At least this reader, after reading and rereading the book was left with the impression that the author had been more suc- cessful in dissecting the differences between the two societies, than in "eliciting" their similarities.12 Not that this is an unworthy achievement for which the author need feel apologetic-after all, it is quite as impor- tant and meaningful to determine the laws that govern the contrasts between the vari- ous urban societies as it is to trace their similarities. 10 The suggestion made on p. 129 that the im- portance of Nippur was due "not to the forcible extension of local cults by politico-military means, of which there is no trace in the available evidence, but in the establishment of interconnections between the administrative staffs of different temples etc." is disproved by the Tummal text (cf. The Sumerians, pp. 48 ff.), according to which it was a king of Kish who, for some as yet unknown reason, built there the temple of Enlil and Ninlil. Similarly the fact that the very earliest forms of writing were not localized (the tablets come from as far north as Kish and as far south as Erech, and no doubt future excavators will find their counterparts in numerous other city-sites) points to a political hegemony over all the more important cities considerably earlier than the Ak- kadian times (cf. The Sumerians, pp. 43 ff. and, independently, Falkenstein apud Edzard. Die Zweite Zwischenzeit Babyloniens, pp. 2-3). In fact it is quite likely that Mesopotamia was politically expan- sionist and even empire-oriented to some extent, long before the Akkadian period, and that the Aztec period in Central Mexico may perhaps better be compared with the Early Dynastic of Mesopotamia. 11 In connection with what, on the whole, is a care- ful and illuminating analysis of the emergence of kingship in the two societies, note the following: For the political role of the assembly in Mesopotamian cities (p. 139) cf. now my "Vox populi and the Sumerian Literary Documents," RA, 58, 149-52. On p. 142, it is to be noted, the emergence of kingship among the Aztecs is shown to parallel that which took place in Mesopotamia in the Enmerkar-Gilgamesh era, which again indicates that the Aztec society is perhaps more comparable to the Early Dynastic of Mesopotamia, rather than to the Akkadian (cf. pre- ceding note). On p. 146, the reader should bear in mind that the tale of Gilgamesh involving the fifty adventurous heroes (it is the poem generally known as "Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living" cf. The Sumerians, pp. 190 ff.), and that concerned with the struggle between Gilgamesh and Agga (cf. ibid., pp. 186 ff.) are two separate literary works and not part of the same composition, as the author's phrasing seems to indicate. In connection with the discussion of the Mesopotamian pantheon on p. 148, it should be noted that Enlil is called "the king of all the lands" in the pre-Akkadian Lagash historical documents (cf. e.g. The Sumerians, p. 313) and that the pre- sumed shift in attitude there alluded to must therefore have taken place in the Early Dynastic period (for a more detailed statement, about the early Mesopo- tamian pantheon cf. The Sumerians, pp. 118 ff.)- once again, therefore, the Aztec society is actually being compared with Early Dynastic rather than Akkadian Mesopotamia. The assertion on p. 154 that it is not till the Akkadian period that Mesopotamia emerged as an expansionist, empire-oriented urban society may, as noted above, turn out to be erroneous cf. also preceding note). 12 Cf. e.g. pp. 40, 47, 51-53, 63, 65, 89, 117, 118-19, 123-24, 130-31, 133, 144, 150-51, 161, 165-69, and the summation of "the differences" on p. 174.</page><page sequence="5">330 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Finally, it seems rather strange and even bizarre, that in a book devoted to such rela- tively advanced, complex urban societies as the Mesopotamian and Mesoamerican, there is a well-nigh total absence of any reflection on, or discussion of, the psychological aspects of their cultures: the drives and motives, the ideas and ideals that gave purpose and mean- ing to their social behavior and institutional activities. It is true that, in general, arche- ology, because of the very nature of its finds, is usually mute and inarticulate on such "ethereal" and elusive matters, and tends to treat the folk whose artifacts it uncovers as faceless automatons without thoughts, feelings, and passions. But in the case of Mesopotamia, and to a lesser degree, of Mesoamerica, there is at hand a rich store- house of literary material that can help us penetrate to some degree into the minds and hearts of the people responsible for the emergence and development of their urban societies.13 It is therefore to be hoped that in the future reprintings and revisions that this admirable book is no doubt destined to undergo, there will be a chapter such as "Psyche and Purpose," or "Views and Values," that will add a psychological dimension to the study, by searching out the similarities and differences in philosophical, religious, and ethical rationale of the two societies in their ideologies and world views.14 SAMUEL NOAH KRAMER The University Museum University of Pennsylvania 13 For the Mesopotamian material, cf. e.g. my Sumerian Mythology, and chaps. 4-7 of The Sumerians; the translations of the Sumerian and Akkadian texts by various scholars in Ancient Near Eastern Texts; Falkenstein and Von Soden's Sumerische Hymne und Gebete. For the still largely untapped Mesoamerica material, cf. e.g. Miguel LBon-Portilla's statement on pp. 446-47 of TheMythologies of the Ancient World. 14 In these psychological and spiritual aspects of the cultures of the two societies, too, the similarities will prove to be broad and fundamental; there is little doubt that the two societies were characterized by similar instinctive drives, emotional motivations, intellectual rationalizations, and ethical values. But again it is the differences that should turn out to be more meaningful for the history of man and his cultural evolution. Whatever the reasons, it is the Mesopotamian who developed a relatively reflective and pragmatic way of life permeated by a sense of balance and moderation, that for an extraordinary long stretch of time saved its culture from stultifica- tion, stagnation, and parochial provincialism. Mat- erially and spiritually, in their religious thought and ethical practices, in their economic, social, and political organization and operation, the Early Meso- potamians managed to strike a viable mean between reason and fancy, the knowable and the mysterious freedom and authority, free enterprise and statism, rights and duties, prerogatives and obligations (for details cf. especially chaps. 7-8 of The Sumerians, and pp. 1, 16, 33-35, 50-82, 99-100, 123-28, 145-46, 157- 62 of The Cradle of Civilization). Mesoamerican society, on the other hand, took quite a psychologically different path, and it is my surmise that its ideological obsessions contained the seeds of self-destruction to a much larger degree than the Mesopotamian, so that it would probably have aborted relatively early even if the Spaniards had not come along and "decapitated" it.</page></plain_text>
