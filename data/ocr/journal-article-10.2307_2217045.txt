<plain_text><page sequence="1">45 ITERATED MODALITIES1 The modest quantity of symbolism required in this paper will be given in the notation of Lukasiewicz. The following elements will be needed: Propositional symbols : p, q, r, etc. Functions of one proposition: Np = not-p Mp = p is possible Lp = p is necessary Functions of two propositions : Cpq = if p, then q Kpq = both p and q Apq = either p or q E'pq = p = q Existential quantifier : xx -- For some values of x Brackets are unnecessary, as the scope of each function is determined by the number of arguments needed to satisfy it. Thus, for example, in the proposition ' CKpqr ', 'Kpq' is one proposition and is the antecedent of the conditional, of which ' r ' is the consequent. In the proposition ' ApCqr ', 'Cqr ' is one proposition and is one of the alternatives, the other being ' p '. Given these elements, we can state the problem which is to be discussed. It concerns two propositions which appear to fall within the province of logic, but on whose truth or falsity the somewhat cursory writing on the subject has as yet produced no agreement. They are (1) CMLpLp and (2) CLpLLp. In words : 'If it is possible that a proposition is necessary, then the pro- position is necessary '; and 'If a proposition is necessary, then it is neces- sary that it is necessary '. Apart from the fact that when a branch of logic allows the formation of propositions one wants to know whether they are true, there are at least two reasons for wanting a decision on these propositions in particular. (a) The former of them, in this respect perhaps rare among disputed pro- positions of logic, ramifies into philosophy : Professor A. N. Prior has shown2 that it is relevant to the traditional formulations of the ontological argu- ment for the existence of God. Since Leibniz, it has been fairly generally agreed that the conclusion of that argument must be something like 'If it is possible that God exists, then God exists '-LCMpp. But in fact it has often been treated in such a way as to suggest that what the proof claims to establish is that if God's existence is possible, then God necessarily exists-LCMpLp.3 Prior has shown that the latter of these formulations rl'his article is based on a paper read to the first New Zealand Philosophical Con- gress, held in Christchurch in May, 1953. 2A. N. Prior, Formal Logic (Oxford, 1955). 3For example, in H. W. Carr, Leibniz, pp. 113-114: ' If God is possible, God is. In other words, if God is a possible existence . . .then God is a necessary existence '.</page><page sequence="2">46 JONATHAN BENNETT follows from the former if and only if we assume CMLpLp. (b) The two propositions under discussion have an unusually irritating quality, in that there appear at first sight to be powerful reasons for rejecting both, and at the same time equally powerful ones for rejecting their contradictories. If proposition (1) is true, then there is a class of propositions whose possi- bility entails their truth; and if (2) is true, then of the members of the same class it must be said that their truth entails their necessity. Further- more, if (2) is true, then we may say of any proposition that if it is necessary then it is necessary that it is necessary that . . . it is necessary-with as many 'necessary's as we have time and patience for: CLpLLLL . . . Lp. And a similar oddity can be demonstrated with respect to (1). On the other hand, the first proposition can be shown to be equivalent to 'CMpLMp ,,4 so that its denial seems to mean that at least some propositions asserting possibility are contingent. And a denial of (2), ' KLpMNLp ', appears to commit us to the view that true propositions about necessity are not them- selves always necessary, and that they are therefore contingent. Those of us who were well brought up have been given to believe that the laws of logic are as those of the Medes and the Persians, so that the suggestion that they are contingent-that in some sense they might have been other- wise-is naturally one which makes us uneasy. That modal logic throws up difficulties of this kind can, of course, be used as an argument against it. Professor Quine has recently used5 the difficulties over reaching a decision about iterated modalities as an additional reason for not using modal terms as statement operators in the first place- additional, that is, to the arguments based on the now well-known difficulties which occur when modal propositions are quantified. The present article is written on the assumption that there are logical truths which are separable from non-logical ones, that this separation is what modal propositions are about, and that the latter are worth systematising in so far as we have got them clear and worth precisifying in so far as they require it. Since an intuitive approach to logic is an assumption of this article, solutions which radically depart from it will not be considered,6 with the exception of Straw- son's illuminating error and of the treatment of the subject by McKinsey. The latter is too powerful and pertinent to be ignored. We may, then, loosely describe the problem as being concerned with the status of the propositions of logic-not the status of logical truisms, but that of propositions which identify such truisms for what they are. The rhetoric of the matter is as indicated under (b) in the third paragraph above, 4The proof is as follows: By converting CMLpLp we get CNLpNMLp, which, by the definition of ' L ' as ' NMN ', is equivalent to CMNpNMNMNp. In this substitute Np for p, to get CMpNMNMp. And this, by the definition of 'L ', is equivalent to CMpLMp. Q.e.d. 5' Three Grades of Modal Involvement ', Proceedings of the XIth International Con- gress of Philosophy (1953), vol. 14, pp. 65-81. 6Thus Prior's decision (op. cit.) on both propositions, coming as a by-product of purely formal work on the axiomatisation of propositional logic, is perhaps the most interesting non-intuitive piece of work yet done on the subject; but it necessarily lies outsi'de the scope of this article.</page><page sequence="3">ITERATED MODALITIES 47 and it is fairly clear that this points to no definite answer either way. A few writers, however, have gone a little further than rhetoric (though many more than this have delivered judgment), and the most substantial of their arguments will be examined in what follows. The thesis will be advanced that none of the arguments considered offers a satisfactory solution; and a tentative answer will be suggested, one which has not (so far as the present writer knows) been put forward before, and which seems to point in the right direction. I In trying to come to grips with what Professor Carnap says7 about the propositions under discussion, we are faced with a question on the answer to which depends our assessment of his treatment of this and of most other partly philosophical problems. The question is: What does Carnap mean his semantic rules to be ? On them he bases his concept of L-truth, which is 'meant as an explicatum for what Leibniz called necessary truth and Kant analytic truth'; but we are still left in doubt as to what explication is. Carnap sometimes speaks of it as though it were something like con- ceptual analysis on a more or less realist pattern, yet his use of the word 'decision' where one would expect the word 'discovery '8 seems to belie this impression and to suggest rather that he sees himself as carrying out a conventionalist programme. As a result of this ambiguity, criticisms of Carnap's solution to the present problem must be stated as a disjunction- one alternative for each plausible interpretation of his work. According to Carnap, a proposition ' p ' is necessary if it is true by virtue of the semantic rules of the system alone, independently of any linguistic facts. Thus, if 'p ' is true by virtue of semantic rules which we shall call A, B and C, then it is necessary : Lp. But ' L ' itself is defined by a further semantic rule, say D, so that ' Lp ' is true purely by virtue of the semantic rules A, B, C, and D. Thus it too is necessary: LLp. Now it appears that by ' semantic rule ' Carnap means either a conven- tion about word-usage, a convention which has traditionally and mistakenly been assumed to be a law about the facts of logic; or he means a convention about word-usage which we try to bring into accordance with the facts of logic. Let us take the second possibility first, and suppose that Carnap believes that there are logical laws to be discovered. On this basis we can say quite briefly that a true (or good ? or adequate ?) semantic rule is a law of logic. On this interpretation Carnap is right in saying that a necessary proposition is asserted (in W. E. Johnson's phrase) ' on the responsibility of Logic '. But the definition of a word or of a symbol like 'L ' is not asserted on the responsibility of logic, nor, to put the same thing differently, is it true in virtue of logical laws alone. Definitions are determined (legislated) in accordance with our requirements for saying 7Rudolf Carnap, Meaning and Necessity (Chicago, 1947), p. 174. 8Cf. C. Lewy's review of Meaning and Necessity, Mind, n.s. vol. 58 (1949), esp. p. 234,</page><page sequence="4">48 JONATHAN BENNETT what we want to clearly and simply : they are not true or false, as proposi- tions are; and they can be changed to suit our requirements, as propositions cannot. And this means that Carnap's lumping together of the two is considerably suspect. An objection must also be raised to his assertion that 'Lp ' is necessary not because of the nature of 'p ' but because 'L' can be predicated of ' p ' simply in virtue of the definition of ' L '. For any predicate which can be truly affirmed of a subject can be so affirmed because of the definition (or at any rate the meaning) of the predicate. 'Christ- church is flat' is true because 'flat' means what it does mean, but that does not make it a necessary proposition. In reply to this it will be said that 'Christchurch is flat' is not necessary because its truth depends not only on the meanings of the words involved but also on the facts about Christchurch. But, similarly, 'Lp' is true because 'L' is defined in the way it is, and because of the facts about ' p '-in particular the fact that ' p ' is such as to be certified by the logical laws which Carnap calls semantic rules. Thus, if we take Carnap's work at the value of this one of its faces, his argument in support of proposition (2) must be rejected. But if he is trying to make logic by means of conventions, denying that there are any logical facts to be discovered, then Carnap must be answered differently. For cannot the conventionalist say that 'p is necessary' does not express a fact about 'p' at all, and thus deny the relevance of the analogy between 'p is necessary' and 'Christchurch is flat ' ? For, on the conventionalist view, necessity is not a property which-as a matter of blunt fact-some propositions have and others have not. The question as to whether a given proposition is necessary has its answer embedded, so to speak, in the language : it is not the sort of question that can be ' investi- gated' in the way in which we can investigate the flatness or otherwise of a city; and definitions and so-called logical laws can be classed together as semantic rules, for they are all man-made and alterable at will. But, leaving aside the question as to whether conventionalism is a tenable pos- ition, this argument will not hold. For if necessity is a matter of man-made rules, the rules have now been made and the question as to whether a given proposition is necessary or not is a quite factual one : it asks, 'What shape has this proposition got, and what do our rules say about that sort of shape ? ' This question is, indeed, more like the question 'Is Christchurch flat ? ' than is any genuinely logical enquiry. And the answer to it is contingent. For if we regard logic as the science of rules governing the use of language, then questions like 'Is it necessary that p ? ' must be put in the form 'Is " p " necessary ? '-they are, that is, about words and not about their meanings.9 And the fact that a sentence is made up of just the words it is made up of is, one would think, a contingent one on any theory of con- 'The writer hopes that, by sometimes regarding 'p is necessary' as short-hand for 'It is necessary that p ', and by treating ' p ' as a stand-in for some definite proposition rather than as a variable, he will be excused the excessive use of quotation-marks and any use of quasi-quotation. The distinction being made in the above passage by the introduction of an extra pair of quotation-marks should be clear enough,</page><page sequence="5">ITERATED MODALITIES 49 tingency. Thus neither of the acceptable interpretations of his words will sustain Carnap's arguments in favour of proposition (2). II Mr. P. F. Strawson's difficult article 'Necessary Propositions and Entail- ment-Statements '10 should probably be taken as an informal prolegomenon to a conventionalist system of logic, rather than as an attempt to complete such a system. Criticism of it could therefore easily be unfair : for example, Strawson's decision to deny proposition (2) by adopting the 'convention . . . that intensional statements are contingent' might be answered with, 'Is that meant to modify our use of the word " intensional " or our use of the word " contingent " 2 Whichever it is, we can coin a new word for what we mean, and put (1) and (2) up for consideration all over again'. But, though nothing in Strawson's article specifically rules out such a retort, and though indeed his too casual conventionalism rather encourages it, it is fairly clear that he is in fact suggesting a theory of logic in which this kind of coining and re-stating has no place. Nevertheless, Strawson's summary dismissal of proposition (2), besides showing that at least one conventionalist does recognise what his con- ventionalism commits him to in this respect, has a curious consequence which can be drawn within the limits of conventionalism, and which illus- trates the fact that even if logic is made and not found it must be made with care : ad hoc conventions such as the one that 'intensional statements are contingent ' appear to be subject to a due regard for what one can only call their logical consequences. For if we adopt Strawson's convention, then Lp is contingent (by convention) but NLLp is necessary (because true by convention) and LNLLp is contingent (by convention) and so on, ad infinitum. This would not be a matter for comment were it not for the fact that Strawson's expressed reason for introducing his con- vention is that there is ' no virtue in such an indefinite multiplication of orders of necessity' as is implied by (2). In trying to reduce this infinite number of ' orders of necessity' Strawson hlas succeeded only in halving it; that is, he has succeeded in nothing. TII A quite different attack on the problem is found in Professor G. H. von Wright's paper on 'Interpretations of Modal Logic '.1 Von Wright does not try to argue the matter out directly, for he claims that neither of our dubious propositions can be accepted or rejected on the basis of self-evidence or of what he calls the 'received truths ' of logic. Nor does he try to do the job by means of definitions in the manner of Carnap and Strawson. lOp. F. Strawson, 'Necessary Propositions and E:ntailment-Statements ', Mind, n.s. vol. 57 (1948), pp. 184-200. llG. H. von Wright, 'Interpretations of Modal Logic ', Mind, n.s, vol, 61 (1952) pp. 165-177,</page><page sequence="6">50 JONATHAN BENNETT Instead, he uses physical models-segments of a straight line, groups within a population, and so on-as analogues for the concepts employed in logic. With these he finds true analogues for the 'received truths' of logic, and then asks whether the corresponding analogues of propositions (1) and (2) are also true of his physical models. Fortunately, he discovers that some of his models verify the doubtful propositions while others do not, and he concludes that neither proposition ' can claim universal validity for the concept of the possible (and the necessary) in modal logic, nor can either of them be rejected as contrary to the " true " nature of modality '. It is 'fortunate' that he comes to this curious conclusion, because such methods can never produce valid results for this kind of logical problem, so that we must at least be thankful that von Wright carried his investiga- tions far enough to show that no result is obtainable in this case. And his conclusion must be taken to mean 'Not proven ', for the only other thing it could mean is that neither proposition is universally true and that neither is universally false. And this, on the basis of tests with physical models, he is not entitled to say. The fact that true interpretations of the doubtful propositions can be found proves nothing, for a little ingenuity can produce true interpretations of propositions which, in their usual meanings, are manifest contradictions. Nor is anything proved by the fact that there are interpretations in which the received truths of logic remain true while the doubtful propositions are false. For, suppose that the doubtful propositions had been found (or, for some purpose, were assumed) to be true, and it was then wanted to show that they were logically independent of the previously 'received' truths of logic: the procedure would be simply to find some interpretation in which the other propositions were true and these two false. This would prove not that the latter were not universally true, but only that they did not follow from the others. And this is just what von Wright has done. IV A far more formidable defence of proposition (2) than any so far dis- cussed has been given by the late J. C. C. McKinsey in his article 'On the Syntactical Construction of Systems of Modal Logic .12 Briefly, the main outlines of McKinsey's position are as follows. To say that a proposition is possible is to say that either it is true or by certain agreed methods it can be 'translated' into a true proposition. The methods of translation consist in what has sometimes been called the substitution of others for the material elements of the proposition, without alteration of the formal elements. Thus, for instance, 'Grass is red and cows are yellow' is a logi- cally possible proposition because the substitution of 'green ' for 'red ' and of 'daffodils' for 'cows ' yields a true proposition. McKinsey's methods will not permit the substitution of anything else for the 'and' in this pro- 12J. C. C. McKinsey, 'On the Syntactical Construction of Systems of Modal Logic ', Journal of Symbolic Logic, vol. 10 (1945), pp. 83-94.</page><page sequence="7">ITERATED MODALITIES 51 position, as 'and ' is formal and not material. Wisely declining to theorise about the notoriously awkward formal-material distinction, McKinsey gives a set of translation rules which implicitly limit 'formal' elements to 'and ', 'not ', and their derivatives. A possible proposition, then, is one which has a true translation. And a necessary proposition is one which has no false translations: to call 'All men are mortal or some men are not mortal' a necessary proposition, is just to say that any substitutions we might make for 'men' and 'mortal' would yield true propositions. Now, if this is all that is meant by saying that it is necessary, then to say that it is necessary is equivalent to asserting (the truth of) the logical product of all the trans- lations. Thus, ' "All men are mortal or some men are not mortal " is neces- sary' is equivalent to 'All men are mortal or some men are not mortal, and all pigs are triangular or some pigs are not triangular, and all philologists are high-minded or some philologists are not high-minded . . .' and so on. In symbols,' LApNp ' is equivalent to ' KApNpKAqNqKArNr . . .'. Now, if the original proposition is necessary, then each translation will be not only true but also itself necessary, and thus their conjunction will be neces- sary. Proposition (2) is therefore true. In this rough and ready formulation the argument may be something less than perfect, but in McKinsey's original, rigorously formalised presenta- tion it is, on its premisses, flawless. There are, however, two premisses which one might question. In the first place one might plausibly claim that there are logically necessary propositions, like 'No green things are colour- less ', which are not true on all translations according to McKinsey's rules- the necessity lying, so to speak, in the ' material ' rather than in the ' formal' parts of the proposition. (This point will be briefly returned to in the next paragraph). Secondly, granting provisionally that if a proposition is neces- sary any translation of it according to the rules will be true, the question arises as to whether this is all that is meant by saying that it is necessary- or, to put the issue in slightly less dangerous language, the question arises as to whether there is nothing more to logical necessity than this fact about translations. The 'naive' realist will want to say that there is something more, and will point to the fact that when we have an intuitive grasp of some logical truth we also have an intuitive grasp of its universality-that somehow or other we can come to know that every proposition of a certain sort must have certain other properties. This is an unsatisfactory account, but it is in accord with common logical intuitions to suppose that logical necessity is in this way linked with universality. But if McKinsey is right, then when someone asserts that a certain proposition is necessary, he is simply saying that every member of a certain (perhaps infinite) class of propositions is true. To which one can only reply, 'How do you know ? ' If there are no modalities, sui generis, if propositions are divided simply into the true ones and the false ones, then the demand naturally arises for an explanation of the fact that we have what appears to be certain know- ledge of the properties of all the members of some infinite classes of proposi-</page><page sequence="8">52 JONATHAN BENNETT tions. Logic, after all, is possible-and the fact requires some explanation. It may not be a very good explanation to say that when we perceive the necessity of a proposition we perceive the necessity of all propositions like it in certain ways, but at least it is better than anything that can be offered by those who deny that there is necessity : for they must say that there are infinite classes of propositions of which the truth of every member is known but which have no distinguishing characteristics except this odd fact of their knowability. It is perhaps worth noting that McKinsey's position in this matter is not unlike that of Professor W. V. Quine, whose notion of 'logical truth ' is defined in terms of statements in which only logical terms (which he enumer- ates) occur essentially.13 The notion of vacuousness, which is the contra- dictory of essentiality in this definition, is exactly coextensive with McKin- sey's replaceability-in-translation, and Quine's logical terms are what have here been called McKinsey's formal elements. Though he does not turn his definition of logical truth to account in connection with the present problem, Quine could probably do so rather more safely and convincingly than McKinsey. For (a) Quine can reject the above claims for the meaning of 'necessary', on the basis of a general philosophy of logic which finds no place for the notions of meaning, synonymy, analysis, etc.; (b) Quine can accommodate the fact of apparently necessary propositions which do not meet McKinsey's translation criterion-an accommodation made possible by an extensive and subtle epistemology of logic and science which appears to form no part of McKinsey's equipment; (c) For the same reason, Quine can answer the epistemological questions raised in the preceding paragraph, without making any concessions to logical realism. These points are mentioned in order to indicate that there is a way of undercutting the presuppositions of the present article, which is far more thorough and far less vulnerable than the somewhat occasional efforts so far mentioned. A critical account of Quine's philosophy of logic and science would be quite out of place here, but perhaps this moral may be drawn from what has been said : it is not so easy as it has sometimes seemed to dispense with the traditional metaphysic of logic-the conventionalist who has, so to speak, come through the problems raised in Quine's 'Truth by Convention' and not around them is likely to end up, as Quine has, with a considerable revision of the whole field. Those who deplore the whole en- deavour will at least welcome evidence that-by its very extensiveness- it no longer has the air of simple, sweet reasonableness which early and un- critical conventionalists such as Hobbes and Ayer tried to give it. V It would lead too far afield to discuss in detail Mr. C. Lewy's attractive and persuasive article, 'Entailment and Necessary Propositions ,14 in 13F'rom a Logical Point of View (Cambridge, Mass., 1953), pp. 22-23; Mathematical Logic (Cambridge, Mass., 1951), pp. 1 ff., 28, etc. 14C. Lewy, 'Entailment and Necessary Propositions', in Philosophical Analysis (ed. Max Black), pp. 195-211.</page><page sequence="9">ITERATED MODALITIES 53 which, in the course of a more comprehensive treatment of the relations between necessary propositions and propositions asserting necessity, our present problem is discussed. Lewy assents to proposition (2); and reasons for not accepting his solution are implicit in the next section of this article. But his analysis suggests the following argument against proposition (2): Consider the propositions (A) LApNp (B) ApNp. Lewy is concerned to discover whether (B) entails (A), in the ordinary intuitive sense of 'entails ' which involves that (A) follows logically from (B) or that ' (B), therefore (A) ' is a valid argument; and he finally decides that (B) does not entail (A). Nevertheless, he claims that (A) is itself neces- sary, and points out that if by 'entails' we meant 'strictly implies' then, on this assumption about (A), we should have to say that (B) does entail (A). That is, LC(ApNp) (LApNp) because of the necessity of the consequent. Now, this can be stated in the form of a formally inexact but nevertheless adequate inconsistent triad: (a) ' LApNp ' is a necessary proposition. (b) 'ApNp' does not entail 'LApNp' in the ordinary sense of 'entails'. (c) There is no sense of ' entails ' apart from that of 'strictly implies '. Any two of these imply the falsity of the third, and this fact constitutes, for those who agree with Lewy that (b) is true and who also concede Professor Lewis's claims for his concept of 'strict implication ',15 a demonstration that 'LApNp' is not a necessary proposition. And since a similar triad could be constructed for any proposition of the form 'Lq ', this constitutes a demonstration (on the given assumptions) that no proposition of the form ' Lq ' is a necessary proposition. VI None of these treatments offers an unequivocal answer which will satisfy those who are convinced neither by esoteric accounts of logical necessity nor by attempts to eliminate necessity altogether. Von Wright's analogies lead nowhere, and attempts, such as that based on Lewy's argument, to deduce either the dubious propositions or their contradictories from self- evident propositions are, to say the least, shaky. Since this amounts to saying that logic cannot settle the problem as it stands, that we cannot alter logic so as to settle the problem, and that it is no use seeking help from outside logic, we are left with only the" rhetoric ' of the problem; and it is to this that we must now return. Let us look again at the proposition 'p is necessary'. It says something like 'p is true in virtue of the laws of logic alone ', or 'the laws of logic ensure that p is true '. What, then, are we saying when we assert that 'p is necessary' is itself a necessary proposition ? Are we not saying that the l6Reasons for doing so are given in the present writer's ' Meaning and Implication ', Mind, n.s. vol. 63 (1954), pp. 451-463.</page><page sequence="10">54 JONATHAN BENNETT laws of logic ensure that the laws of logic ensure that p is true ? And if the meaning of' LLp ' is something along these lines, then surely it is always false. It would not, of course, be hard to make fun of this way of putting it (' Quis custodiet. . .? ' and so on), and it would be pleasant to be able to state the matter less metaphorically. But this much seems to be, on the basis of the assumptions of this article and therefore of much of the liter- ature on the subject, reasonably clear and beyond dispute: there is a body of logical truth in terms of which judgments about the logical properties of propositions can be made; and it just is not true to say that this body of logical truth is also its own guarantee, or that it guarantees or confirms or ensures its own relations with other propositions. The laws of logic cannot be guaranteed by the laws of logic-or by anything else. One of the mistakes which Achilles made in his discussion with Carroll's Tortoise was in trying to argue with the beast at all : we can justify propositions by logic, but we cannot justify logic by anything. So proposition (2) is false. Whether this is to be taken as implying that modal propositions are contingent depends on what we mean by 'contingent'. As a rule, when we describe a proposition as 'true and contingent' we mean that, though it is true, within the logical structure of things it could have been false-' It is true, but logic doesn't rule out its falsity '. And in this sense the pro- positions of logic are clearly not contingent: we cannot say that, with the facts of logic remaining as they are, the facts of logic could have been differ- ent. For a true proposition the terms 'necessary' and ' contingent ' are proper contradictories only within the limits of logic-each refers to a relationship between the given proposition and logic itself. But proposi- tions about the logical status of other propositions can come into neither of these categories. Thus the second of our dubious propositions and its 'con- tradictory' are-in the meanings usually assigned to them-both false. To ask whether ' Lp ' is necessary or contingent is to ask logic for its credentials; and, of course, it has none. VII Something must now be done with our symbolism, for, whatever we say about the words ' necessary ' and ' contingent ', the fact remains that 'Lp ' and 'MNp ' (or their analogues in Lewis's or any other notation) are contra- dictories by definition. All we can do, then, is either to treat ' MNp ' as ' contingent' and 'Lp ' as ' either-necessary-or-modal ' or to treat ' Lp ' as 'necessary ' and 'MNp ' as ' either-contingent-or-modal'. It is fairly clear that the former choice is the less likely to cause confusion. For ' KpMNp ', 'p is true and contingent ', we should usually say, conveys a definite idea that though 'p ' is true things might have been otherwise- that, so to speak, there is some counterfactual conditional with a conceivable antecedent and 'Np ' as its consequent. So that to take the latter alter- native, interpreting 'MNp ' as 'p is either contingent or modal' and 'Lp'</page><page sequence="11">ITERATED MODALITIES 55 as 'p is necessary' (in the strict sense outlined above) would be to alter the meaning of ' M ' in a radical and misleading way. However much change we force in traditional meanings by adopting the former alternative, it will almost certainly be less than this. Given these interpretations, proposition (2) is true, for all it says is that it is not the case that, within the framework of the laws of logic, the laws of logic could have been different. And the proviso regarding the meaning of ' L ' need not give much inconvenience : in most cases we can take ' L' as meaning 'necessary' in the usual way, so long as we are prepared to back down when it is predicated of a proposition which is itself modal. It would be useful, however, to have a symbol which means 'necessary' (or rather, to correct what has been a systematic imprecision in this article 'It is necessary that. . .') with no backings-down for special cases. Suppose we use the letter 'T' for this purpose; then we can deny proposition (2), in the sense in which it has usually been understood, by asserting that NCLpTLp-it is not the case that if a proposition is not-contingent, it is necessarily not-contingent. (And we can also assert that NCTpTTp.) The point of divergence of 'T' from 'L' can be marked by the equivalence, which could be used as a definition of 'T': El (Tp) (KLpNAAAE'pMqE'pLqE'pMNqEIpLNq), the singularly unattractive right hand side of which means simply 'Lp, and p is not a modal proposition '. VIII So far almost no attention has been paid to proposition (1)-' CMLpLp '. It implies proposition (2)16 but is not implied by it, so that in the present circumstances it requires separate treatment. Neither proof nor disproof can be given in this case, any more than they can in the other, but an in- vestigation of proposition (1) in the light of what has already been said suggests that it is true. It has been argued above that where ' p ' is a modal proposition 'Tp' is always false. The same cannot be said of 'Mp', for all true propositions are possible and some modal propositions are true. But we may well ask just how much we do say by such an assertion as that MLp. Perhaps, to revert to the almost anthropomorphic language used earlier, we may expand 'MLp' into something like 'The laws of logic permit that the laws of logic demand that p is true', or, more plausibly, 'The laws of logic being what they are, they do not rule out the possibility that the laws of logic rule out p's falsity'. And these formulations make it clear that the ' M' in 'MLp ' adds nothing : it has an occurrence as vacuous 16The proof is as follows : We have as hypothesis that (1), CMLpLp, is a logical law; and its converse, CLpMLp, is also a logical law (derived by substitution of Lp for p in CpMp, which is a logical law); whence it follows that E'MLpLp. Now, it was proved in an earlier footnote that (1) is equivalent to CMpLMp, which, with the substitution of Lp for p throughout, gives CMLpLMLp. And in this, by the logical equivalence of Lp and MLp which has just been proved to follow from (1), we may substitute Lp for MLp in both antecedent and consequent. This yields CLpLLp, which is proposition (2). Q.e.d.</page><page sequence="12">56 JONATHAN BENNETT as that of the first existential quantifier in ' 'xEx&lt;x '. So proposition (1) is true. There is one way in which it might seem possible to find propositions which could be necessary but in fact are not so; a way which appears to have been followed by Dr. A. F. Emch some years ago in the course of a sketch of a new theory of implication.17 Suppose we are trying to discover whether a proposition is logically necessary, and we discover first that it is not of the form ' KpNp '. If it were of that form it would be impossible, and as such could not be necessary-which might lead us to say, in the case where we find that the proposition is not of the form 'KpNp', 'For all we have discovered so far, it could be necessary'. There is a sense in which this would be a true statement, even if 'p ' were not necessary. But the force of the ' could ' is not that normally conveyed by the ' M ' symbol; for all the above statement means is that there is a logical law, ' NLKpNp ', stating that certain sorts of propositions are not necessary, but that the proposition under consideration is not of that kind. And if this were what is usually meant by 'possible' in logic, we should have some curious con- sequences :-For example, supposing that the first thing we discovered about this proposition was that it did not follow from the axioms of some consistent but incomplete system-an unlikely first discovery, but not an inconceivable one-this might lead us to conclude that the proposition ' could' be false. This would be a 'could' in the sense just outlined, and in this sense the statement would be a true one: the proposition ' could, on the evidence ', be false. Yet the proposition concerned might nevertheless be a logically necessary one, so that if this sense of ' could' is assimilated to ordinary logical possibility, we have the odd phenomenon of a proposition which could be false yet cannot be. No other considerations have been advanced which would lead one to doubt the contention that an 'M' pre- fixed to a modal proposition is simply a redundancy which can be ignored; and since this consideration will not stand up, we may conclude that 'CMLpLp ' is true.
