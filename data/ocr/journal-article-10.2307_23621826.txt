With the increasing ubiquity of portable spectrograph^ techniques in Australia it is timely that the complexities of field-based analyses are discussed. A review of portable x-ray fluorescence (PXRF), including the limitations of the technique, and discussion of the complex physical interactions encapsulated by the resulting elemental data, provide a firm basis for interpreting the analysis of a rock art panel on the Woronora Plateau, New South Wales. PXRF data supports the results of previous (laboratory-based) pigment characterisations, that a locally sourced, composite clay based paint was used to produce rock art. Results highlight the requirement for specific knowledge and expertise, not only in relation to the technique, but also the rock art under investigation and, critically, its taphonomic context. Ultimately this case study demonstrates that portable spectrometry should be considered an addition to the existing repertoire of archaeometric techniques applicable to the study of rock art, rather than as a replacement for laboratory analyses. Introduction The application of portable x-ray fluorescence (PXRF) has a ca 35 year history in archaeometry, with a veritable explosion in its use for the investigations of archaeomaterials, such as ceramics and obsidian, in the last decade (Guilherme et al. 2008:444; Speakman et al. 2011:3483). The increasing ubiquity of portable spectrographic techniques has been largely driven by an increase in commercial availability, and the decrease in price of 'hand held' instrumentation, combined with the growing importance of non-destructive methods in contemporary archaeology (Heginbotham et al. 2010:178; Joyce 2011:199). The most desirable attribute of portable spectrometry is that analyses are able to be conducted in the field (i.e. in situ), without destructive sampling or composition-altering sample preparation and therefore without adverse impact to the material culture being investigated. The trade-off is that there are limitations inherent in accuracy, precision and sensitivity of portable spectrographic techniques compared to laboratory-based instrumentation. In respect of the serious ethical considerations associated with rock art research (Bednarik 1992; Clottes 1992; Watchman 1992a), the non-invasive nature of portable spectrometry represents unprecedented sampling freedom. Rapid acquisition of compositional information is possible, enabling the collection Archaeology and Paleoanthropology, The University of New England, Armidale NSW 2350, Australia &lt;jford5@une.edu.au&gt; of large (statistically robust) datasets (Williams-Thorpe 2008), thereby allowing the examination of archaeological patterns, contrasting the isolated cultural indices provided by previous opportunistic sampling/solely laboratory-based analyses of Australian rock art pigments (Cole and Watchman 1993, 1996; Huntley et al. 2011). Importantly, in situ analyses allow research questions to be addressed at an appropriate spatial resolution: the composition of pigments can be systematically studied across a motif, rock art panel, site, site complex or geographic region (bounded by an identified 'stylistic' art province). The success of all archaeometric analyses rests with a critical evaluation of the physical properties (beneficial attributes and inherent limitations) of the selected technique(s) and their efficacy in relation to archaeological inquiry. For the analysis of archaeological pigments, techniques such as XRF are inherently limited because they identify the elemental composition only, not the structural (crystallographic or compound) nature of the sample (Lirtzis and Zacharias 2011:119). Elemental data is a powerful tool in pigment research, but only 'where well-defined questions have been posed, whose answer relies on the resolution of a given dichotomy' examinable by the technique employed (Aloupi et al. 2000:18). This fundamental principle underpins the case study presented herein. With commercial PXRF instruments, field portability has come at the cost of power through the miniaturisation of x-ray tubes, which decreases detection limits and reduces the suite of elements that can be measured compared to laboratory-based energy dispersive XRF (Guilherme et al. 2008:444). There are many laboratory-based non destructive techniques available for investigating the chemical composition of archaeomaterials that offer greater precision and are able to analyse a larger number of elements (Lirtzis and Zacharias 2011:110). There are also numerous high precision geochemical techniques with minimal sampling requirements that have been applied to the investigation of Australian ochres (Creagh et al. 2007; Green and Watling 2007; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2012). The benefits of non-invasive, in situ rock art analyses must therefore be balanced against the resulting limitations of PXRF to define research questions of archaeological interest that can be examined. The following section reviews the limitations and complexities encountered when applying PXRF to rock art. The intent is not to provide a comprehensive overview of the physics of PXRF for all rock art applications, rather a context for discussing the results of the case study presented. General issues associated with the field application of PXRF and the extremely specific nature of data obtained, which must be interpreted with reference to their unique taphonomic context, are highlighted. 78 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 75, December 2012</page><page sequence="2">Jillian Huntley (née Ford) Complex Physical Interactions: Some Issues Associated with In Situ PXRF Analysis of Rock Art The principle of XRF spectrometry is that primary x-rays from an x-ray tube or radioactive source are incident upon the surface of a sample and create inner shell (K, L and M) atom vacancies. These vacancies de-excite, producing secondary, fluorescent x-rays with measurable characteristic energies diagnostic of the elements present (Pollard et al. 2007:101). XRF analysis (including PXRF) is a bulk analytic technique where elemental characterisations are an average of the entire sample volume (Shackley 2011:10). PXRF estimates 'the bulk composition of the sample from what is essentially a surface measurement' (Potts 2008:10), especially in relation to light z elements (&lt; iron). Figure 1 illustrates the surficial nature of light element PXRF analysis and the attenuation effects discussed below. It is widely accepted that sample thickness affects the precision of elemental measurements from PXRF (Lirtzis and Zacharias 2011:127). Rock art pigments, like those from other archaeological contexts (wall frescos, illuminated manuscripts, pottery decoration, etc.), are often found to be what analysts term 'infinitely thin' in relation to XRF: When the penetration depth of the incident radiation emitted by the exciting source, and the secondary x-ray emitted by the sample, is larger than (or of the same order of magnitude as) the sample thickness, then the sample is considered ... infinitely thin (Cesáreo et al. 2008:209). In other words, a sample is infinitely thin when incident x-rays completely penetrate, or pass through, the material being analysed. The thickness of rock art pigments varies. Personal observation of articulated (i.e. still bonded to the shelter substrate) black and red rock art pigment from the Sydney Basin via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show thickness is tens of microns (ca 7-50 pm), but varies in the order of tens of microns across millimetre lengths of discrete motifs. Published observations of Gwion1 motifs from the Kimberley, Western Australia, where paints appear to be applied relatively consistently/thickly are generally ~25 pm (Watchman et al. 1997:Figure 3-20). My recent observations of articulated Gwions via SEM are that pigment thickness varies between ~25-275 pm, again over millimetre lengths of motif. Therefore, most, if not all, rock art will be infinitely thin, especially in relation to heavier z elements (&gt; iron). Most importantly, pigment volume will vary within PXRF analytes. Critical depth penetration is another essential consideration when selecting areas for analysis and interpreting PXRF data, especially in relation to archaeological materials, such as lithic artefacts and mineral pigments (ochre), that are susceptible to complex geological weathering processes resulting in compositional segregation at the sample surface (Cook et al. 1990; Potts 2008:10; Smith et al. 1998; Williams-Thorpe Gwion motifs have historically been referred to in academic literature as 'Bradshaw' figures.

Compiled from SEM backscatter micrographs (Ford 2006) (image by Lucas Huntley). 2008:179). Previous empirical studies of light z element critical depth penetration in silicate rock (rhyolite—comparable to the sandstone shelter matrix in the case study) have demonstrated increasing x.-ray attenuation with depth for PXRF (Potts et al. 1997). Critical depth penetration of elements such as potassium, calcium, titanium and iron have been shown to be ca 30 pm, 35 pm, 50 pm and 170 pm; however, the analyte volume is cone shaped, meaning that half of the contribution of bulk chemical composition is derived from ca 5 pm, 5 pm, 7.5 pm and 50 pm, respectively (Potts et al. 1997:33, emphasis added). It is well-established that air attenuates low energy x-rays, particularly affecting the measurement of light z elements (&lt; titanium). For this reason laboratory-based energy dispersive XRF instruments often operate low energy analyses in a vacuum or change the chamber atmosphere, purging it with helium (Shackley 2011:30). During in situ analysis unprepared samples with uneven surface morphologies can introduce additional air gaps between the sample and PXRF instrument (Forster et al. 2011:393; Lirtzis and Zacharias 2011:132). In addition to attenuation, gaps between the instrument aperture and the surface of the analyte may introduce significant, and as yet unquantified, errors relating to angles of incidence and detection in respect to variation of fluorescence intensity (de Boer 1989; Jenkins 1999:39). These issues have led some analysts to conclude that fully 'quantitative results cannot be obtained directly from rock samples in the field which have irregular shaped surfaces' (Potts et al. 2005:769). The structure (mineralogy, mixed grain size and density) of materials under investigation is one of the most well-documented factors affecting x-ray attenuation and self-element secondary fluorescence (Karydas 2005). Again, this is especially so for unprepared samples. Concisely put, in bulk analyses the 'matrix emission intensity of each element is a function not only of its concentration but also of the overall composition of the larger area under investigation' (Lirtzis and Zacharias 2011:119). The size of the 'area under investigation' (i.e. analyte volume) in PXRF is reduced compared to laboratory-based energy dispersive XRF, commensurate with the smaller x-ray tubes facilitating field portability. PXRF is therefore sensitive to mineralogy and grain size effects (Forster et al. 2011:394) and attenuation due to matrix density. Quantitative density measurement is required to a tr &lt; Number 75, December 2012 auStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 79</page><page sequence="3">Taphonomy or paint recipe: In situ portable x-ray fluorescence analysis of two anthropomorphic motifs from the Woronora Plateau, New South Wales calculate coating thickness (Piorek 2008:62) and critical depth penetration (Potts et al. 1997:32). Density has been shown to be a significant attenuation factor in PXRF analysis of experimental aluminosilicate matrices (Forster et al. 2011), pigments (Mantler and Schreiner 2000) and lithics (Potts et al. 1997; Williams Thorpe 2008). Matrix density is of particular relevance in the case study presented here, as both the shelter substrate and clay-based rock art pigments are porous. Water absorbs x-rays more strongly than air and occurs in pigment rock art in two ways: as part of the crystalline structure of minerals (part of geological compounds), and in the pore spacing of rocks/clays. The latter has the greatest potential to impact field-based PXRF by reducing the spectral response of characteristic x-rays, leading to Tower precision, poorer detection limits and lower accuracy' (Liangquan Ge and Lin 2005:28). Orientation: Browns Road 29 The two bichrome anthropomorphic motifs analysed in this study are located in one of hundreds of known pigment rock art sites in the Sydney Catchment Authority's Metropolitan Special Area (MSA) on the southern Woronora Plateau (Dibden 2011:202; Ford 2006:7-8) (Figure 2). Browns Road 29 (BR29, AHIMS 52-2-1643) was recorded in 1991 as part of a systematic survey by the Illawarra Prehistory Group (Sefton 1991). Prior to this, the character and extent of rock art within the Cordeaux River catchment was unknown, except for a few isolated shelters (McCarthy 1961,1967; Sim 1964), though various geographically discrete, impact assessment-based archaeological investigations in the Catchment during the late 1970s and early 1980s had noted the potential for shelters to contain art (e.g. Attenbrow and Happ 1983:6). Rock art from the Woronora Plateau, including 31 sites from within the MSA (McDonald 1994:2008 as cited in Dibden 2011:71), has been incorporated into broad, regional scale stylistic syntheses. Two major phases of pigment rock art have been defined in the Sydney Basin (McCarthy 1967, 1988; McDonald 2008). This broad sequence is again recognised in recent detailed analyses of the discreet MSA art assemblage by Dibden (2011) and both pigment phases are present at BR29. Dibden (2011:261) noted differences within the specific and nuanced formal signatures of complex locational, environmental and spatial patterning in the pigment art sequence not previously identified in broad-scale syntheses. Anthropomorphic motifs at BR29 are attributed to the most recent period of art production on the Woronora Plateau (Dibden 2011:339). This latter pigment art phase has an inferred chronology of somewhere between ca 4000 years ago and the colonial period in the broad Sydney Basin regional sequence proposed by McDonald (2008:249, 343); however, after evaluating several lines of evidence, Dibden plainly stated that 'in the absence of direct dates for the rock art, or of any associated archaeological deposit, establishing the timing of this sequence for the Upper Nepean, with any certainty is not possible' (2011:157). BR29 is a clam-shaped rockshelter located in a cliff-line immediately below a major ridge running perpendicular to the Illawarra Escarpment. Bedding of the sandstone is relatively thin, resulting in multiple minor benches and a dramatically rugged landscape (Young and Young 1988:12). The site is approximately Figure 2 Location of BR29 (AHIMS 52-2-1643). The grey shading is the Metropolitan Special Area, with the Nepean, Avon, Cordeaux and Cataract Dams inset (left to right) (image by Lucas Huntley). 22.5 m wide at its mouth, with a northwest sloping ceiling ranging from approximately 3.5-0.7 m in height (Figure 3). The floor is mostly bedrock, with thin, step-like bedding cross-sections visible, as is detritus from the ceiling (exfoliated spall flakes and small block fall). A large joint in the bedding, located at the base of the ceiling, allows water to flow through the sandstone massif, while several smaller unconformities and eroded bedding planes are present across the ceiling within the rock art panels (Figure 4). BR29 contains 43 motifs, predominantly eels and anthropomorphs exemplified in the panel examined. Art at the site is notable for the relatively large size of the motifs and for the frequent use of colour (bichrome and polychrome, including yellow) (Dibden 2011:339). The specific findings of previous pigment characterisation conducted on yellow pigment from the central anthropomorphic motif at BR29 (In Situ Loci 3, Figure 5), re-examined in this case study, are outlined in 'Research Aims' later. This previous pigment characterisation was undertaken as part of a pilot study designed to redress the imbalance presented by previous examinations of archaeological raw materials in the Sydney Basin, which had been predominantly lithic (Attenbrow 2002:122-123). The pilot demonstrated the viability of pigment characterisation and the potential of pigment provenancing studies within the complex, active geomorphic environment of the Hawkesbury Sandstone. Furthermore, a variety of information relating to pigment sources, application, chronology and taphonomy was gained. However, the results of this pilot study were by no means conclusive, being necessarily constrained by a sampling strategy that explicitly avoided adverse visual impact to the rock art (Ford 2006; Huntley et al. 2011). Taphonomic Context of the BR29 Rock Art Weathering of geological formations is complex, depending on many environmental factors and the material properties of the rock itself (Wells et al. 2008:1047). Mineral composition (particularly crystal structure) greatly influences the type and course of weathering, especially chemical (cavernous) processes (Twidale 1968:136-137). BR29 is a Hawkesbury Sandstone shelter, the dominant geology of the Woronora Plateau (Hazelton and Tile 1990; Twidale and Campbell 1993; Young and Young 1988:11). The geological strata of the MSA consists of the Illawarra coal measures (exposed in the Illawarra Escarpment/ eastern boundary), a small remnant of Narrabeen Sandstone 80 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 75, December 2012</page><page sequence="4">Jillian Huntley (née Ford) Bedrock Location of art panel under / investigation Shallow sediment &gt; fine sand Main Drip Line — Block FallI I \ 5 Metres k Secondary Drip Line Figure 3 Plan and section drawing of BR29 (image by Lucas Huntley).

Lambert (1980) undertook a quantitative by clay-rich cements often containing calcium (Twidale 1968; study of the amount of salt contained within detrital sands Vinnicombe 1980). Grain structure is typically 80-90% quartz, found at the base of active cavernous weathering in three 5-10% feldspar (aluminosilicate crystals that often contain shelters. Prior to this work the prevailing view concerning salts calcium) and 1-5% mica or kaolin (clay), with grain sizes was that they were only a primary catalyst in arid or coastal ranging between 350-500 pm (Hunt et al. 1977:113; Wells et environments (Hughes 1978:3; Young and Young 1992:71). al. 2008:1048-1049). Iron-oxides (haematite, maghemite and Lambert (1980:30), however, demonstrated that soluble salts goethite) are present throughout Hawkesbury Sandstone and (from 0.8-1.4%) were present in all detrital sands of the active concentrations from 5.7-20.4% are reported in the matrix cavernous erosion measured in the Hawkesbury Sandstone, cement (Hunt et al. 1977:114-115). Most surprisingly, the largest concentration of salt was found Recent literature is scant in relation to the geomorphology in the most inland shelter (some 50 km from the coastline), of Hawkesbury Sandstone and little quantitative research Of particular relevance to this case study is the fact that none has been undertaken since the 1970s and 1980s in relation of the cavernous weathering examined by Lambert displayed to either the processes causing, or the rates of, weathering in macroscopic salt encrustations (Lambert 1980:31).

In Hawkesbury Sandstone the precipitation of secondary minerals and their deposition at, or near, the rock substrate surface results in a less permeable, structurally harder mineralised layer, known as case hardening (Young and Young 1992:74). Again, the presence of soluble salts has been noted as catalysing and accelerating case hardening, enhancing dissolution of precipitous minerals (Mol and Viles 2011:302), particularly iron, clay and calcite phases (Young and Young 1992:74). Mineralised or case hardened layers at the rock surface represent compositional segregation of the matrix, as discussed in the preceding section. Deposition of precipitates results in altered mineralogy and therefore different chemical composition at the rock surface. Case hardened surfaces are visible across the ceiling at BR29 in areas of fresh cavernous weathering or flake exfoliation. Observed case hardened surfaces across the rock art sites on the Woronora Plateau vary in thickness from 50 pm to 5 mm (see Ford 2006:Plate 18-36; Huntley et al. 201 l-.Figure 5-90). Precipitous mineral deposition also forms coatings or mineral skins on rock substrate surfaces. Mineral accretions are the best described geological weathering products in rock art research, as their potential to contribute chronological information (numerical age determinations) has been well demonstrated in Australian contexts (e.g. Aubert 2012; Watchman et al. 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005). Silica rich accretions, commonly known as amorphous silica skins (hydrated amorphous silicon dioxide, Si02.nH20) (Watchman 1996:ii), have been observed throughout rock art sites in the Hawkesbury Sandstone (Lovering 1952). Precipitous mineral deposition appears consistently across the ceiling at BR29. The accretion at BR29 (presumed to be amorphous silica) has formed small irregular, coral-form stalactite structures commonly in the order of &lt;0.5 mm, but which can be up to 3 mm in height. These micro-stalactites occur in moderate, consistent density across the BR29 ceiling and their morphology and colour matches the description of common opal, coralloidal stalactites given by Lovering (1952:Figure 2-30) and Young and Young (1992:77-78). At BR29 the silica skin lies underneath the anthropomorphic motifs under investigation (Figure 5). The chemical composition of silica skins is predominantly derived from weathered source rock. In Hawkesbury Sandstone this is generally the same rock on which they have formed (Watchman 1992b:62). The composition of the BR29 silica skin is presumably derived from the Hawkesbury Sandstone, though the mechanism of silica skin formation is somewhat less straightforward. Watchman's work in the 1990s concluded that typically in rock art sites throughout Australia 'silica skins are not formed from solutions that flow directly out of the rock immediately underlying the skin ... they are surficial precipitates, or accretions formed by deposition from water that flows across stable surfaces' (Watchman 1996:212, emphasis added). This appears not to be the case for the BR29 silica skin. Rather, the stalactite structures indicate that the origin of the accretion is slow percolation of ground-waters through the orthoquartzites (Hawkesbury Sandstones) (Clarke 1916; Lovering 1952:30; emphasis added). This mechanism of silica deposition has been noted in shelters which have roughly planar roofs due to their extension back along bedding planes, such as at BR29. The consistent presence and density of silica stalactites across Figure 5 Detail of the rock art panel. The white ovoids indicate the location and approximate size of the PXRF instrument aperture. In Situ Loci 3 (i.e. Spectrum 3) is the location of previous pigment harvesting (photograph by Jillian Huntley). the ceiling (rather than grouped stalactite structures along obvious seepage, fractures or joints) is further evidence that silica is precipitated through the sandstone massif (Young and Young 1992:77). The microstructure of silica skins has implications for x-ray attenuation. Features of vitriform amorphous silica skins include air voids and spherical (quartz) grains ca 5 pm in diameter, dispersed through thin sheets or plates of deposited opal-CT (Watchman 1990a:29). Silica stalactites in the Sydney Basin sandstones observed under SEM show layered rings with small air voids between concentric, circular depositions of amorphous silica (Young and Young 1992:78). Internal air gaps, isolated large grains and the irregular surface micromorphology of the BR29 coral stalactites may contribute to x-ray attenuation, including variation in radiation path lengths, resulting in reduced fluorescent intensity during in situ PXRF analysis. Finally, it is important to understand the properties of the rock art pigments themselves, as they have the potential to impact their own weathering (Odlyha et al. 1997 as cited in Sumner et al. 2009:241). Pigments act as a surface modifier, changing albedo, light transmissivity, thermal and moisture properties (Bullet and Prosser 1983 as cited in Sumner et al. 2009:242). The thin, dispersed nature of paints at BR29 is expected to significantly reduce the impact pigments have in relation to weathering. However, the physical properties of the paints, being porous and clay-based, indicate they could have an altered chemical composition due to the incorporation of precipitous minerals, particularly silicates and iron-oxides (Young and Young 1992:74). In addition, mineral pigments often undergo compositional segregation (particularly at their surface) through phase transitions due to heat or oxidisation (Cook et al. 1990; Smith et al. 1998). The physical properties of rock art paints that have the most potential to impact on in situ PXRF can be grouped as microstructural—specifically, grain size and porosity. The grain size of modern industrial pigments is ~ 1 pm, whereas rock art pigments generally contain a mixture of grains, ranging in size from very fine to very coarse. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the error introduced by grain size heterogeneity in XRF analysis of pigment is low where average grains are &lt;5 pm (Mander and Schreiner 2000:32). However, MSA rock art paints contain mixed grains, from very fine kaolin and mica clays a few 82 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 75, December 2012</page><page sequence="6">Jillïan Huntley (née Ford) microns in diameter, to long, tubular-shaped feldspars typically black and no pigment (Figure 4).

Methodology Routine analysis of Ohio Red Clay, a standard reference PXRF has a practical sampling advantage, as strategies can material used in archaeometric investigations, was undertaken be adjusted in an 'interactive' mode to accommodate the 'live' daily (Glascock 1992; Kuleff and Djingova 1998; MacDonald et evaluation of results (Potts 2008:11).

Multivariate analyses were used to compare trends in overall element characterisations with trends in discrete indicator element groups. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) (using a correlation matrix) and (Ward's) Hierarchical Clustering of NPA data was undertaken using JMP 9 software. Untreated NPA values were used for multivariate exploration, as no assumptions about normative distributions were made (Baxter and Jackson 2001). PCA and hierarchical clustering techniques were selected as they have an inverse relationship in terms of the premise of data processing (modelling vs explanatory approaches) (Baxter and Jackson 2001:131; Glascock et al. 2004). This was intended to explore variation (if present) in compositional groups defined by multivariate techniques with orthogonal vs agglomerative approaches. Geochemical variability of data collected was explored by comparing trends within the relative abundance of indicator element groups (i.e. specific groups of elements indicative of cavernous weathering, clays and precipitous mineral deposition). NPA data classified as representative of different taphonomic and cultural phenomena (indicator elements) were treated by a logarithmic transformation to facilitate comparison of trends due to large variation in values (a function of differential critical depth penetration) (Baxter 2003:75; Glascock 1992; see also Table 2). Results and Discussion Trends in the relative abundance of elements (summarised in Table 1) were interpreted to address the aims of the case study presented. Direct comparisons of relative abundances are not useful, as NPA values reflect the discrepancy in bulk analyte volume. The multiplicity of attenuation effects relating to field sampling notwithstanding, there is a relationship between NPAs as a function of atomic weight and resulting critical depth penetration (Figure 1). NPA values measured in the spatial transect on the control block for silicon at &lt;100, compared to iron in the thousands to tens of thousands, demonstrate the discrepancy (Table 2). Critical depth penetration with PXRF in this case study is estimated to be from ca -10 pm and -200 pm for silicon and iron, respectively (Potts et al. 1997:33). Silicon therefore measures around 5% of the analyte volume of iron with PXRF, rather than reflecting the compositional concentration of silica in Hawkesbury Sandstone, which is 80-90% quartz (Wells et al. 2008:1048) with minor (variable) iron concentration in matrix cement measuring 5.7-20.4% (Hunt et al. 1977:114). Trends in Overall Compositional Data It is important to stress that the aims of this case study do not extend to archaeological provenance (or sourcing) studies in the conventional archaeometric sense (Dillian and White 2010; Speakman et al. 2011). Archaeometric use of the term provenance is established on the basis that there exist differences in chemical composition between different natural sources that exceed, in some recognisable way, the differences observed within a given source material (Weigand et al. 1977:24). Here I define characterisation studies in the broader framework of provenance as used by collection managers (Russell and Winkworth 2009), employing geochemical characterisation towards the notation of a biography of rock art as object (Gosden and Marshall 1999) and inferring past social context for the object from geochemical data. Studying the materials from which an artefact is composed (i.e. its geochemical composition), rather than the materials from which an artefact is made, greatly enlarges the research potential and scientific significance of the artefact and the archaeological/ethnographic site from which it is derived by enabling comparisons with other objects and sites (Russell and Winkworth 2009) regardless of the successful identification of source materials to their original geographic location. Though many archaeometric studies of ochre have been conducted in Australia, no technique or approach (i.e. combination of techniques) has satisfactorily resolved archaeometric provenancing of pigment beyond the resolution of indices and trends to broad geographical regions and/or non-geographically described mineralogical sources (Creagh et al. 2007; David et al. 1993; Goodall and David 2001; Goodall et al. 2009; Green and Watling 2007; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2012; Smith and Fankhauser 2009; Smith and Pell 1997; Smith et al. 1998, 2002). Even the latest generation of very high precision geochemical techniques can only evaluate trends observed in compositional groups of ethnographically known Australian ochre sources (Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2012, emphasis added). Trends in the chemical composition of pigment(s) provide important archaeological indications regarding procurement and use, regardless of unequivocal geochemical 'fingerprinting'. In the BR29 pigment measured for this study there is a strong overall trend to low relative abundances for in situ analytes compared to the control block and internal standard. This demonstrates that the attenuation effects outlined above (surface morphology, heterogeneous mineralogy and grain size, matrix density, compositional segregation at the shelter surface and the silica skin at BR29) are having a marked impact, lowering fluorescent yields. Notable exceptions to the overall low relative abundance trend in situ are aluminium (which is consistent throughout all analytes), silicon, sulphur, chlorine, vanadium and manganese, which all trend higher in situ, and chromium, which was either at or below the limit of detection for all analytes, except two of the three experimental (red) motifs on the control block (Figure 6). 84 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 75, December 2012</page><page sequence="8">Jillian Huntley (née Ford) c N Moderate0 Moderate0 Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate 3 O I O _l I £ o -J Low Low Low Low Low Low 0 O Moderate High Negligible Low to Negligible Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate 0) LL Moderate Very High Low Low Moderate Moderate High High IVIn Low Low to Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate w o Negligible ▼ o —I Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible &gt; Moderate Moderate Moderate to High Moderate to High Moderate to High Moderate to High Moderate to High Moderate to High p High to Moderate High to Moderate Low Low Low Low Low Low &lt;z u Moderate to High" Moderate to High" Low to Negligible Negligible Negligible Negligible Moderate Moderate a High High Moderate to High Moderatet Moderate Moderate to High High High u Very High to Very Low Very High to Very Low Moderate to High Moderate to High Moderate to Low Moderate to Low Low to Moderate Low to Moderate V) Low* Low* High Moderate Moderate High Low to Negligible Low to Negligible 55 Moderate Moderate High 0 High HighO High 0 Moderate to High Moderate to High &lt; Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate Moderate High High &gt; Element v Spectra Location Control Block No Pigment (25 loci, 1 spectrum each) Control Block Applied Pigment (3 loci, 1 spectrum each) In Situ Loci 1 - Black Pigment (2 spectra) In Situ Loci 2 - No Pigment (2 spectra) In Situ Loci 3 - Yellow Pigment (1 spectrum) In Situ Loci 4 - Yellow Pigment (2 spectra) Ohio Red Clay Powder (2 spectra) Ohio Red Clay Fired Solid (1 spectrum) o c E ® CD _0 o q3 CJ CD c 'o O CT&gt; - "O W c co CO CD co E w v; 2 5® Em 03 a -C EE &gt; CD — ™ ~F&gt; 10 03 ^ i_ P O LL. o (J 'c 'a) | 1 111 TJ CD ! i 1 = 1 8 "g - I g "S £ 7 i3 - = ^ 8 £ ■§ | t c o m ° * W P £ c = ® I p £ ™ ?i 1.1 0 •= o&gt; a. &lt;2 &gt; 3 X "O c 2 £ o .£ 2 1 ?:iE 0 CO E -C a £ 3 £ r°" a c C 5 •&gt;.

Values given in bold italics are analyte locations on the control block containing applied pigment (refer to Figure 6). Multivariate analysis (PCA and cluster) of analytes provides clear evidence for the multiple attenuation effects described for field-based PXRF through the separate grouping of the in situ and other analytes, illustrating the effect of pigment volume within the bulk PXRF analytes, and highlighting the structural (mineralogical and/or grain size) heterogeneity of the Hawkesbury Sandstone shelter matrix. Figures 7 and 8 graphically represent the separate grouping of in situ analytes from the control block and standard. The separate clustering and projections in multivariate space of the three internal standard analytes illustrate the effects of signal attenuation via matrix density. PXRF data from the same standard in two different density states group separately, despite having exactly the same chemistry. The two standard spectra that group together are from the powdered Ohio Red Clay, with the third, separate standard spectrum collected on a solid matrix of the same standard reference material (spectra 36 and 37, and 35 respectively in Figure 7). Separation in both multivariate analyses (cluster and PCA) of the partial experimental motif analytes from the control block (Figure 6) demonstrates the important contribution of pigment volume within PXRF spectra (spectra 21 and 7, and 9 in Figure 7). The separate groupings of Hawkesbury Sandstone without applied pigment in both multivariate analyses, graphically represented by the grey squares in Figure 7, show the mineralogical heterogeneity of the internal shelter matrix for which the control block is a proxy. The clustering of both yellow and black pigment analytes (Figure 7) is consistent with the interpretation of previous archaeometric research: that a composite (clay-based) recipe was used to create various colours of rock art paint on the south Woronora Plateau. This interpretation is further supported by the trends present in groups of indicator elements. Trends in Indicator Elements In order to untangle the complex taphonomy of the BR29 rock art panel, groups of elements indicative of various natural and cultural processes were identified and resulting trends in their NPA data examined. Within defined indicator element groups, an overlap exists between the products of geological weathering and the geochemical signatures of rock art production. This is intuitively obvious because rock art pigments are natural minerals (often termed ochres), that are themselves products of geological weathering (Rowe 2001:200; Watchman 1990b). The overlap of geochemical indicators, where specific elements and groups of elements are present in geological weathering and rock art pigments, highlights the need for detailed knowledge of site specific taphonomy for the successful interpretation of PXRF analysis. One of the primary catalysts for, and geochemical signatures of, cavernous weathering is salt (Lambert 1980; Young 1987; Young and Young 1992). Previous analytic work describing soluble salts in the detrital sands of cavernous weathering alcoves determined sodium, magnesium, sulphur, chlorine, potassium and calcium to be chemical components (Lambert 1980:30). Sodium and magnesium are below the detection limits of the PXRF instrument used in this study. Of the remaining elements, chlorine was the major chemical component identified in detrital sands, making up c &lt; Number 75, December 2012 auStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 87</page><page sequence="11">Taphonomy or paint recipe: In situ portable x-ray fluorescence analysis of two anthropomorphic motifs from the Woronora Plateau, New South Wales z Zh ■1 ■2 ■4 ■8 ■12 ■3| ■23 ■11 1 ■19 ' ■17 ■21 '5 Zh ■15—1 ■14 1 ■25 ' ■6 Zl ■24 ' ■22—J ■27—' ' ■10— ■28 •35 ■13 ■16—i ■26—Z ■18 1 ■20 " ■7 ■9 ■29 ■32—I □30 □31 •36 •37 Figure 7 Dendrogram scaled by distance.

Sulphur, potassium and calcium were minor components of the detrital sands, measuring -3%, -1.3% and -5% ion composition, respectively (Lambert 1980:30). Within the panel at BR29, chlorine, sulphur, potassium and calcium are thus identified as elements indicative of salts and therefore chemical (cavernous) weathering. Measurement of these indicator elements was essential for addressing the primary aim of PXRF analysis at BR29: was detrital (chemically weathered) Hawkesbury Sandstone used as the colour producing constituent in yellow paint? In addition, PXRF provided a means of examining the presence and relative abundance of cavernous weathering elements not necessarily macroscopically visible (Lambert 1980:31). The results are presented in Figure 9. Potassium and calcium trend lower at BR29 compared to the control block and standard, whereas sulphur and chlorine trend higher (Figure 9). Sulphur and chlorine are present, and in greater relative abundance, on the art panel than within the sandstone matrix (for which the control block is a proxy). Chlorine, sulphur, potassium and calcium are light elements, with a critical depth penetration of less than or equal to -30 pm (Potts et al. 1997:33), excluding the (unquantified) impact of attenuation effects. As the lightest elements of the cavernous weathering indicator group, sulphur and chlorine measurements are the most surficial. The results illustrated in Figure 9 therefore indicate that sulphur and chlorine are present at the surface of the panel, throughout rock art pigments and in the shelter substrate. This assertion is supported by the presence and reasonably consistent relative abundance of sulphur and chlorine throughout the panel, including black and yellow pigment analytes and the analyte with no pigment (inset, Figure 9). The patterning in chlorine and sulphur relative abundances at BR29 is of interest, not only as an indication of a potential catalyst for cavernous weathering, but also as potential constituents of rock art paint. Relative abundance of chlorine and sulphur is reasonably consistent throughout the in situ analytes, though on closer inspection sulphur measured equivalent to chlorine or in a higher relative abundance in spectra from yellow rock art paint. Chlorine is a major chemical component of cavernous weathering (Lambert 1980), while sulphur has been identified as a major chemical component of the yellow rock art paint from the sample located in the present In Situ Loci 3 (Huntley et al. 2011). The similar or higher measurement of sulphur in yellow pigment is consistent with the findings of previous research and indicates that sulphur is both present as an indicator of chemical weathering on the art panel and as a constituent in the yellow rock art pigment. The dispersed and surficial nature of the pigments at BR29 (Figure 5), in addition to the infinitely thin nature of pigment, incorporates the shelter substrate into the bulk analyses. To this end, calcium can be used as a proxy for the contribution of the sandstone shelter substrate in the PXRF spectra. Calcium is a known constituent of the clay-rich cements and feldspars in Hawkesbury Sandstone (Hunt et al. 1977; Twidale 1968; Vinnicombe 1980; Wells et al. 2008). However, calcium was not observed in the previous analysis of rock art pigment on the southern Woronora Plateau (Ford 2006:Appendix 6; Huntley et al. 2011:87). Patterning in Figure 9 suggests that the pigment volume of In Situ Loci 3 (yellow pigment) is the largest measured, as no calcium was observed. This is consistent with this loci being identified previously as the thickest extant pigment application within the panel (see Huntley et al. 2011:88). AU of the matrices analysed are clay rich aluminosilicates with high relative abundances of potassium. While consistent with the overall trend to lower yields in field-based analysis, moderate (rather than low) relative abundance of potassium was measured in situ at BR29 (Figure 10). Potassium is a moderate chemical component of clay. Potassium was identified as a minor chemical component of cavernous weathered detrital sands, however the small fraction (approximately 1.3 weight percent of ions in 50 g of dissolved sand measured [Lambert 1980:30]) is considered below the detection limits of in situ PXRF. Potassium measured in pigment analytes at BR29 is considered to have derived in 88 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 75, December 2012</page><page sequence="12">Jillian Huntley (née Ford) small part from the sandstone matrix substrate of the shelter (including the case hardened surface and silica skin) and predominantly from the clay-based rock art paint. The low relative abundance of potassium in Loci 2 (no pigment), compared to the analytes from rock art pigment locations, supports this and is consistent with previous research that concluded clay was a common constituent of rock art paints on the Woronora Plateau (Ford 2006; Huntley et al. 2011). Consistent relative abundances of aluminium throughout analytes reflects the consistency of the (aluminosilicate) matrices analysed and the mobility of aluminium as a precipitate, making it consistently present within the BR29 case hardened shelter substrate and the silica skin. Conversely, titanium measured a lower relative abundance in situ, consistent with the overall trend. The contribution of the titanium filter in the light element methodology PXRF is assumed to be constant due to the consistency of aluminosilicate matrices. The trend to a lower relative abundance of titanium at BR29 (as described for potassium) is considered to derive primarily from the contribution of clay within compound rock art pigments. Similarly, the very sublet trend in aluminium to lower relative abundance between In Situ Loci 2 and the analytes that contain rock art pigment may represent a greater contribution of aluminium in the clay-based pigments. Given it is the lightest element measured, the very surficial nature of the analysis means that the expression of the trend in aluminium would not be as pronounced as in titanium or potassium (Figure 10). The strong trend in silicon to markedly higher relative abundance in situ is comparable to the trend discussed for sulphur and chlorine. Just as chlorine and sulphur are indicative of taphonomic processes (cavernous weathering), the trend to high relative abundance of silicon is interpreted as predominantly the chemical signature of the (amorphous) silica skin located across the BR29 ceiling. Previous laboratory analyses identified silicon as a major chemical component of yellow rock at BR29 (Huntley et al. 2011:87). The silicon trend at BR29 is a minor of the trend discussed for potassium (Figure 10). While silicon is a major chemical component of clay, the higher relative abundance of silicon measured for In Situ Loci 2 (no pigment) suggests that there is higher silicon on the shelter substrate (the silica skin). The marked trend to high silicon abundance in situ is complementary evidence for the dispersed and surficial nature of the pigments, and contrasts with the overall trend to lower x-ray yields. The final indicator element group represents the chemical signatures of precipitous minerals that result in case hardening and accretions (Figure 11). The scant quantitative data available suggest that, as a result of mineral precipitation in sandstones, the exterior of quartz grains becomes coated in kaolinite and/or calcite (Young and Young 1992:74), resulting in clay- and calcium-rich chemical signatures, inconsistent with the calcium pattern observed by PXRF.

Hawkesbury Sandstone. While the overall iron trend at BR29 Variation in copper and zinc relative abundance is therefore is again to low relative abundance, there is an obvious trend less attributable to field-based attenuation effects and more to higher relative abundance for iron in yellow paint (Figure reflective of the heterogeneous mineralogy and mixed grain 11). Trace element concentrations of iron were measured in size of the Hawkesbury Sandstone matrix. The consistency of yellow paint from BR29 by PIXE/PIGE (Ford 2006:A4-1), copper and zinc at BR29 is therefore indicative of the fine however iron was not identified as a chemical component of grained, homogenous micromorphology of the case hardened yellow paint via SEM-EDXA, nor were iron-oxide minerals shelter surface (Figure 1), as evidenced by the contrasting identified through XRD (Huntley et al. 2011:87, 89-90). Iron fluctuations in copper and zinc measurements in the internal measured by PXRF is interpreted as being both a chemical sandstone matrix for which the control block transect is component of in situ mineralogical segregation, present a proxy.

The smaller suite of elements observed in situ manganese, vanadium and cobalt trends observed by PXRF compared to SEM-EDAX and PIXE/PIGE (Ford with PXRF are similar to, though more subtle than, the 2006:Appendix 6; Huntley et al. 2011:87) is due to the detection trend discussed for iron (higher in yellow at BR29 and in the limits of the technique.
