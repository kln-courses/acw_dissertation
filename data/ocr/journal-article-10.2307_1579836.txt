<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONCEPT AND FUNCTION OF REASON IN ISLAMIC ETHICS by G. E. von Grunebaum Los Angeles Hellmut Ritter zum 70. Geburtstage* The universal mission of French civilization has been argued on the ground that it is, as it were, made to the measure of man (M. Lambilliotte, Mission pacifique et universelle de la culture frangaise. An address before the Troisieme Congres de l'Union Culturelle Fran?aise, Fribourg, Swit- zerland, September 21, 1956. "La culture frangaise est vraiment ' la taille de l'homme"). The same conviction of its perfect adjustment to human nature and human needs supports the claim to universality of Islam. Both civilizations are fond of contemplating their own reason- ableness and both take for granted the effective existence in mankind of reason as a fairly uniform capability to which this reasonableness is fitted as key to lock. But where in France, as perhaps in the West as a whole, reason is primarily an instrument to expand the known universe and to organize it through understanding, in Islam it is above all an instrument to accept and befriend a universe which God not only has made but of which He indicated the interpretation by revelation; so that there is a distinct limit beyond which the sacrificium intellectus will become the most profitable attitude for man to take-a limit neither epistemological nor introspective but rather a limit set by supreme and benevolent Wisdom in the interest of man whose rescue from himself and from perdition the Lord would wish to see accomplished. This is why not only a very considerable number of messengers and prophets were, at different times and in different places, entrusted with conveying to mankind the information-facts as well as commands- necessary to guard them in this and to guide them in the next world; but this benevolent satisfaction with man as the most noble of His creatures must, more particularly, be recognized as the cause due to * Zum 70.

E. von Grunebaum which the facts of life as well as the positive law to which man is to submit in his own interest are so perfectly attuned to his God-given nature. So to achieve salvation man needs to discipline but not to cripple or distort his gifts, as the foremost of which he may be well advised to recognize his rationality. For Islam, to say it once more, takes man safely through both worlds and it does so because it is the religion of the mean. "We have made you a community in the middle, ummatan wasaltan" (Koran 2: 137/142, transl. R. Bell, Edinburgh 1937-39 1). This brief statement (clear enough in itself but introducing in the Holy Book a statement not altogether clear in its intent) has become the locus classicus for that sentiment of the Muslim that his faith enjoins the middle path between dedication to the life of the body as this is peculiar to polytheists and idolaters and hostility to the body as this is peculiar to the Christians and their monk- ery (e.g., Tabari- d. 923- Tafsir, Cairo 1321/1903, II, 5; likewise still the recent Shiite commentary Kitdb al-Mizdn ft tafsir al-Qur'dn by Saiyid Muhammad H.usain at-Tabdtabi'i, Teheran, n.d., 1955 or 1956, I, 322- 323; the commentators are agreed on assigning the Christians to the one extreme but are somewhat at variance with regard to the upholders of the other). And God has called the Muslims wasat, those in the middle, "because of all things God loves best the intermediate ones" (Tabari, Taf- sir II, 514: id kdna ahabb al-umiir lilldh ausatuhd 2). Thus the preferred position which the Islamic community enjoys in the favor of the Lord is due to its moderation; and this moderation is nothing but an expression of the unequalled adaptation to human nature which distinguishes the Muslim revelation and hence the ethics implicit in it. God has made man rather than the angels his xalifa or deputy on earth (Koran 2 : 28/30). His qualification for this xildfa (deputyship) is that knowledge of the 1 If H. Lammens, Tdif I la veille de l'hdgire (Beirut 1922), p. 70 and again, La Mecque i la veille de l'he'gire (Beirut 1924), p. 306, should be right when he argues that umma wasa.t actually meant in the mouth of the prophet 'un peuple d'61lite' the interpretation given the phrase by the Muslim community would only gain in significance in terms of its self-view. 2 Cf. also the praise of the fourth (of the seven) climes as the middle one and of the Persians as its rulers; e.g., Mascfidi (d. 956), Kitab at-Tanbih wal-israf, ed. M. J. de Goeje (Leiden 1893), p. 622: the author glorifies the kings of Persia for having ruled over ausa.t al-ard1 wa-asraf al-aqdlim, 'the middlemost part of the earth and the noblest of climes' (the passage is translated by Carra de Vaux, Le livre de l'avertissement et de la revision, Paris 1897, p. 9); similarly Barhebraeus (d. 1286), Muxtasar ad-duwal, ed. A. S.lhpni (Beirut 1890), p. 793-4: the Persians are ausa.t al- umam daran wa-aSrafuhum iqliman, 'the nation with the most central homeland and the noblest in regard to the clime (they inhabit)'. Both passages have been included in cAll Akbar Dahxudd's Amtal wa-hikam (Teheran, n.d.), pp. 166510 and 1548" respectively.</page><page sequence="3">Concept and function of reason in Islamic ethics 3 names of things-an archaic mode of expression which we may in our terms interpret as that of the true being, the essential reality of things- which God has taught him in preference to the angels; in other words, God relies on man's reason or on his rationality when he entrusts him with the viceregency of the earth to administer it and enjoy its usufruct. Man is the summit of creation and reason the noblest quality of the many with which God has honored him (al-Oazzali, Ihyd' 'uliim ad-din, Bfilq 1289/1872, IV, o10819). "It is God's greatest blessing to us, and there is nothing that surpasses it in procuring our advantage and profit 0.. By Reason we have comprehended matters obscure and remote, things that were secret and hidden from us;... by it we have achieved even the knowledge of the Almighty, our Creator, the most majestic of all that we have sought to reach and our most profitable attainment" (The Spiritual Physick of Rhazes, i.e. Muhammad b. Zakariyd' ar-Rdzi- d. 925-at-Tibb ar-riuhdni, trans. A. J. Arberry, London 1950, p. 20). There is no divergence of outlook between a freethinker like Razi, the great physician, and a theologian like Oazzdli (d. IIII) who declares Reason "the means to attain felicity in this world and the next" and who reflects that even "Turks, Kurds and the coarse Bedouin", despite their closeness to the order of the beasts, will by a natural instinct honor the old because their reason, sharpened by experience, has given them an incontestable superiority (Oazzali, Ihyd' I, 83). And both the scientist and the theo- logian derive a moral obligation from man's possession of this supreme treasure. We must not degrade reason nor counteract it in conducting our affairs. "We must not give Passion the mastery over it, for Passion is the blemish of Reason,... Nay, but we must discipline and subject our Passion, driving it and compelling it to obey the every dictate of Reason. If we do thus, ... we shall be happy in God's free gift and grace of it" (Spiritual Physick, p. 21). Linking his anthropology to ethics by a different path, Gazzili insists on man's duty to be grateful to his Lord for having received reason (or: intelligence, 'aql) as well as good character and knowledge. And he observes on the side-with perhaps more serious- ness than we would tend to ascribe to this remark-that it is part of the nobility of reason that he who does not possess it enjoys it as much as he who does and that, in fact, there is a general inclination to consider oneself better endowed with it than one's fellows-all the more cause, Gazzdli concludes, to render thanks to God for as much of it as one fancies oneself to have been granted by Him (Gazzali, Ihyd' IV, 1235-11). Ibn al-Cauzi (d. 1200oo) justifies the writing of his Axbar al-hamq or Stories of Fools by arguing that these stories "will move intelligent persons to give thanks to their Creator that they were not made that way"; cf. F. Rosenthal, Humor in</page><page sequence="4">4 G. E. von Grunebaum Early Islam (Philadelphia 1956), p. 4, whose paraphrase is adopted as the Arabic text is not accessible to me. What, however, is the nature of that 'aql, or reason, whose possession is such an essential characteristic of humankind ? And are the associations called up by the term the same in a Muslim as in a Western milieu ? Two circles, one may say with some oversimplification, two circles or types of thinkers have been leading in the analysis of the concept of reason. The faldsifa, the Aristotelians and neo-Platonists of Islam, resumed and developed the Greek notions of 'aql as the antithesis of perception, studying it in its function as the theoretical and the practical intellect and attempting to meet the difficulties inherent in the description of individual psychological experience in terms of universals not really amenable to individuation. The direct bearing of their constructs on the ethical ideas of the Muslim community has not been considerable. The theologians and moralists, on the other hand, moving on a more practical level reflected popular ideas which they consolidated by systematizing them. Oazzdli is well aware that the word 'aql is used in more than one sense and that a good deal of disagreement on the subject of "reason" is due to the failure to realize the multiple connotations of the term. He discusses four principal meanings in which 'aql is used. (i) It is the quality that distinguishes man from beast and predisposes him to the reception of the theoretical sciences, al-'uliim an-nazariya; (2) it is the knowledge which teaches a child to distinguish the possible from the impossible and makes him discern "axiomatic" facts such as that two is more than one; (3) it is also the knowledge which experience yields; finally-and here we meet with that ethical turn that is characteristic of the theological examination of 'aql-(4) we call him possessed of 'aql who realizes the consequences of actions and manages to control his emotional impulses in the light of his foresight (Ihyd' I 84-85). 1 The connection between reason and right conduct is as firmly established in popular as in theological consciousness; intellectual brilliancy per se does not suffice to make a man an 'dqil. For the basic definition conceives of 'aql not merely as a source of knowledge but specifically as "a natural way of knowing, independently of the authority of the revelation, what 1 This passage is not to suggest that Gazzill's view of caql does justice to all aspects of Arabic usage. The philosophers proper developed a considerably more elaborate classification of the concept. Avicenna (d. 1037), for example, disting- uishes no less than eleven kinds of caql; his terminology has been listed conveniently by J. Bielawski, Deux pdriodes dans la formation de la terminologie scientifique arabe, Rocznik Orientalistyczny 20/1956, 281, note 32 (on the basis of the more extensive discussion by A. M.

F. Rahman, Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed., I, 34,b f. s.v. "akl). What we miss (but our medieval forebears, the contemporaries of the thinkers whose ideas we are attempting to summarize, would probably not have missed) is the endeavor to analyze the epistemological relation between human reason and the extrahuman data with which it is concerned, the range (or the limitation) of the sphere within which its judgment may claim ("objective") validity, and the conditions which its very structure (it, too, left unanalyzed by the medieval Muslim) imposes on the world so as to render it perceptible and organizable by the means with which reason is endowed. For from an epistemological viewpoint, the mutakallim is content to contrast "aql as a source of knowledge with tradition, or naql; in this contrast, 'aql will be coordinated with aprioristic, naql with "accidental", historically determined, factual or positive knowledge. This elementary typology of knowledge has been developed into a classification of the sciences or, to be more exact, of the religiously relevant sciences, that is, to stay within the terminology and the value-world of the ethically oriented theologian, the "useful" sciences. 1 Here the 'aqlfydt, the (kinds of) knowledge which are accessible to (divinely) unaided reason are confronted with what is variously called al-'uliim as'-s'ar'ya wad- diniya, legal and religious knowledge as based on revelation, or sam- 'iydt, subjects that cannot be proved by apodictic arguments but derive from Koranic or traditional data. The 'aqlfydt include, as the name implies, all that reason can acquire by itself, as "on the ethical level, the natural values of law and morals." Ildhfydt, theology proper, maintains a somewhat ambiguous position in that it is sam'i as being based on scripture but 'aqli as being amenable to rational argument; prophetology, on the other hand, as well as eschatology and the positive statutes of law and government are merely sam'i, ex auditu, that is, they could not have been developed at all correctly without God's assistance through revelation (for this paragraph cf. L. Gardet, Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed., I, 342b-343a, s.v. 'aklfydt). Even though human nature has been so constituted as to be able to obtain its fundamental moral orientation without ad hoc guidance, the concrete precepts man is to follow are not simply derivable from innate insights nor are the concrete precepts which require fulfilment neces- 1 To the warnings against preoccupation with useless knowledge which this writer collected on pp. 117-119 of his Islam.

What has recently been called "theistic subjectivism" (by G. F. Hourani, Ethical Value, Ann Arbor, Mich. 1956, p. 31),1 that is to say an outlook which defines as ethically good "whatever is approved by God" and as the " 'rightness of acts' their being commanded by God", has become the orthodox position in Islam and in a sense, the theoretical justification of Islamic law. Consequently it has been the existence or non-existence of an element of rationality or rational purposiveness in religious precept which became the crucial issue for those to whom God's pedagogical arbitrariness seemed incompatible with their concept of the divine or with their sense of human dignity. A Hellenizing philosopher such as Miskawaih (d. 1030) cannot reconcile himself to the thought that any injunction of the sari'a could lack a direct relation to an inborn disposition or need of man. Companionableness or "social feeling", uns, is an elementary human trait. It is to cultivate this trait that the ?arc'a imposed the duty to perform the five daily prayers in common rather than in isolation. The purpose of that community prayer is, as Miskawaih expressly states, to actualize the natural companionableness which is in man in potentia. The Friday Service, which will bring together people from different parts of town, the two principal festivals of the Muslim year, which will unite villagers with townspeople, and even the pilgrimage to Mecca, which unites Muslims from every country, are viewed and if you wish, accounted for, by the same consideration (Miskawaih, Tahdib al-axldq, Cairo 1323/1904, p. 46; cf. R. Walzer, Aspects of Miskawaih's Tahdhib al-Akhldq in: Studi orientalistici in onore di Giorgio Levi Della Vida, Rome 1956, II, 619-621; but cf. p. 621 n. I). Oazzali, on the other hand, insists on the educational value of obedience to irrational command. Without self-restraint and control of desires, God cannot be approached. This realization motivated the monks and recluses of earlier religions to retire from this world. But for the Muslim God established the obligation to pilgrimage as a substitute for permanent abnegation of the world. He asked the believers to foregather in Mecca to His glory even as visitors will foregather at the court of a human 1 An unusually clear formulation of this outlook occurs in Ibn IH.azm (d. 1064), al-Ihkim li-usiil al-ahkiim (Cairo 1345-48), VIII, 120-132, whose argumentation is designed to support the tenet that "Allah does what he wishes with no regard to cause or reason." Brief excerpts from this passage have been translated by E. Graif, Probleme der Todesstrafe im Islam, Zeitschrift fiir vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft 59/1957, 118-19. The same author, ibid., 119-121, quotes Ibn al-Mal'ak (not al-Malik as Grif writes; ca. 1427) commenting on Nasafi (d. I310), Mandr al-us~il, for the opposite outlook which strives after a reconciliation of the structural order of reason with that of revelation.</page><page sequence="7">Concept and function of reason in Islamic ethics 7 monarch, submitting to His majesty in humility and recognizing that He was too great to be encompassed not only within any house but within any one country. To induce their devotion and to deepen their sense of dependence, God "imposed on them" during the hacc "actions which are not agreeable to the hearts and to whose meaning the minds, 'uqfil, would not be guided by themselves" such as the so-called stoning of the devils at Mind and the courses between as-Saf~ and al-Marwa. "By actions of this kind the completeness of submission and servantship becomes evident." Other precepts such as the poor-tax have an easily understood objective with which reason will readily agree; fasting is an obvious technique to combat desire; prostration during prayer a persua- sive gesture of devotion; but in ritual actions like the stoning of the devils there is nothing to attract heart or mind; they are done merely in response to a command; so their execution testifies to that sacrifice of intellectual reservation which is required for absolute obedience; and it is in such unqualified self-dedication that Oazzdli finds the religious purpose of the believer's obligation to visit the sanctuary of Mecca once during his life-not by way of a journey planned as he pleases but bound to an irrefrangible ritual order compliance with which will, in part at least, run counter to every inclination of will and reason (cf. Gazzdli, Ihyd' I, 252-53). To the Muslim the fact of a religious truth seemed to imply its change- lessness; validity meant validity for ever and anon; on the analogy of religious truth-and in which truth would there not be an element connecting it with the edifice of the more specifically religious verities ?- truth as such, that is any statement about the universe commanding rational assent, was conceived of as descriptive and static. Developmental change, predictable modification were uncongenial concepts, the delib- erately provisional, heuristic or at any rate conditional character of much of our "scientific" truth was an irritant, not to say a counter-sense. Authority could be trusted and followed not only because ancient excellence was unlikely to be reached again, let alone to be surpassed; but also and mostly because in a universe that had been delimited by revelation and largely accounted for by reason the yielding up to empir- ical observation or other fact-finding methods, of orientation points already safely fixed would have injected an element of uncertainty into human thinking as well as acting that seemed intolerable to medieval man and incompatible with the kindness of the Creator who had placed His creatures into a finite and firmly scaffolded universe. The paramountcy of strictly "scientific" interests in some thinkers led to their proposing a concept of rational truth that is a close kin to our</page><page sequence="8">8 G. E. von Grunebaum own idea of the validity of scientific insight. It was not merely the ortho- dox who resisted and ultimately defeated their approach. The sectarian, too, opposed any attempt to deabsolutize scientific and philosophical knowledge. The conflict between the two ideas of the nature of scientific truth has found expression in one of the most curious documents which we possess of the intellectual life of the Muslim Middle Ages. The Ismd'ili, Abi Hltim ar-RIzi, seems to have been in the habit of writing up succinct yet in part at least verbatim accounts of his discussions with Muhammad b. Zakariyv' ar-Rizi (d. 925), the great philosopher-phys- ician whom we have encountered earlier in this presentation. One day, they came somewhat obliquely onto the problem of the nature of scien- tific truth. The uniqueness of the document will, I hope, suffice to justify my presenting it in full even though the fact that the disputants broach their subject in a slightly circuitous way might have made a summary a more convenient means of bringing their arguments into focus. "I (Abfi Ijitim ar-Rizi) challenged him (Muhammad ar-Rdzi) at another meeting and said to him: Tell me about the principle you maintain which asserts the five pre-existents: the creator, the soul, matter, space, and time (301). Do the ancient philosophers agree with you on it or differ from you? H e sai d: The ancients held varying opinions on this subject. But I have remedied this by much investigation and reflection on their principles; and so I have found what is the truth that cannot be refuted or escaped. I said: How was it that the mental powers of those sages failed and their views diverged?-when, as you claim, they were independent thinkers, muctahidin, devoting all their concern to the study of philos- ophy until they attained the subtlest sciences and became scholars and models in them. Yet you claim that by much investigation of their writings, rusfim, and books you have attained what they failed to attain; -while they were your leaders and you their follower, for you studied what they left behind, looked into their principles, and learned from their books. And how can it be that the follower should rank higher than he who is followed and that he who is led be more perfect in wisdom than the leader ? He said: I shall offer you evidence on this, which will show you that the case is as you say, and which will let you tell truth from error on this subject. Know then that any latecomer among the philosophers if only he devotes his interest to the study of philosophy and gives himself over to it incessantly, exerting himself independently with all his might and investigating the points on which, because of their subtlety and diffi-</page><page sequence="9">Concept and function of reason in Islamic ethics 9 culty, the ancients differed, will acquire and preserve what his prede- cessors knew and improve on it by his own intelligence, the multitude of his studies, and his consideration of other materials. For he is versed in the knowledge of his predecessors and is perceptive of other informa- tion, which he considers superior; for investigation, reflection and independent effort cannot but result in addition and improvement. 1 I said: If the remedies arrived at by the latecomer are at variance with the position of his predecessors, as you are at variance with those who preceded you, then this variance is not an advantage; rather, vari- ance is an evil, an increase in blindness, added support for falsehood, a contradiction, a corruption. Indeed we find that by your many investi- gations and speculations you philosophers have increased solely the variety and contradictoriness of your opinions. And when you stipulate in your own case that the latecomer will attain to what the predecessor did not, as you have claimed that you have done in offering views at variance with your predecessors, you cannot be sure that there will not come after you one striving to dissect what you have been trying to do; who will know what you did but will add to it (302) and attain through his intelligence and personal effort and reflection what you failed to attain. He will contradict your judgment and oppose your very principles just as you contradicted your predecessors and opposed their very principles when you asserted the five pre-existents and claimed that your prede- cessors were mistaken where they were at variance with you. It is just as if you were each at variance with the other. On this basis, Sarf.ta, corruption, fasdd, would be established in the world, truth disappear forever, and falsehood become methodically organized. Those who are at variance with you have accomplished only vanity and error; for variance is vain, and a mistake is error. And you too, on this basis, will necessarily accomplish only vanity and error since those that will come after you will on the pattern, qiyds, of your views offer some new point, fd'ida, and hit upon something you missed. He said: In this there is neither vanity nor error; for each of them (i.e. both the predecessor and the successor) is giving his best effort, muctahid. If he exerts himself and occupies himself with reflection and investigation he is proceeding on the path of truth; for souls are not purified of the turbidness of this world or freed for that other world except through the study of philosophy. So when someone studies it and 1 The idea of the time element in scientific progress (but without the ethical aspect of such progress) occurs already in al-Kindi (d. 873) apud F.

E. von Grunebaum attains something of it, however little it be, he purifies his soul from this turbidness and renders it free. 1 And if the common crowd who ruin their souls and are neglectful of study would devote but the slightest concern, nazar, to it (i.e. philosophy), this would liberate them from this turbidness, even though they attained only a little of it. 2 I said: Are you not insisting that study of philosophy is itself achieve- ment of the truth and escape from vanity? He said: Yes. I said: But you have also asserted that the people are ruined through antagonism and disagreement. Thus, by your own assertion, those that study philosophy increase simply in being ruined. For you have declared that the philosophers hold varying views and that what you believe yourself is at variance with the opinions of your predecessors; and you have yourself accepted the presupposition, ?ari.ta (lit.: theory), that your successors may be at variance with you as well as with others. On this supposition (303), ?arita, the cause of ruin will become stronger every day and vanity, bd.til, and error increase. H e said: I do not count this either vanity or error; for he who examines and exerts himself independently is on the way to the truth, muhiqq, even if he does not reach his objective, as I have already explained to you; because souls are not purified except through study and investiga- tion. This is the whole of what I have to say. I said: Now if you persevere in this assertion and reject the truth and resist it stubbornly, then do tell me what you think of one who studies philosophy while yet believing in the ordinances of the prophets: does his soul become purified and do you expect him to be freed from the turbidness of this world ? He said: How could he become a student of philosophy while yet believing in those fables, xurdfdt, retaining those varying tenets, and persevering in ignorance and submission to established opinion, taqlid! I said: But did you not claim that anyone studying philosophy even though not very deeply and examining into it the least bit would purify his soul? He said: Yes. 1 Here we have, as it were, a 'de-Islamicised' version of the common idea that the muctahid's effort even if a failure is meritorious in itself. 2 The confrontation of the roots sfw and kdr is, of course, not an innovation of RAzi's. Cf., e.g., already Muh.ammad b. Yasir ar-Riyd?i (d. under al-Muctasim, who ruled from 833 to 842), ed. C. Pellat, 20. I (in: al-Magriq 49/1955, 316): "Is there anything pure that does not turn turbid, anything pleasant that does not tend toward changing for the worse ?" Cf. also the passage quoted by Quddma b.

What fables, xurdfit, could be more numerous, what submission to opinion go beyond this and what ignorance be greater. What purification could come to the soul of such a one, and what could he achieve except the rejection, raftd, of prophetic ordinances, loss of belief, kufr, in God and His prophets and messengers, the denial of God's existence, ilhidd, and voiding the very concept of God, ta'.til!

Hodgson (ed.), Introduction to Islamic civilization, Course Syllabus and Selected Readings (Chicago 1958-59), I, PP. 387-90. (Quoted by permission of the publisher, the University of Chicago Press.) The tone of this discussion is reminiscent of those disputationes frequent in the Patristic period of which minutes were prepared with the knowledge of the participants. Origen (d. ca. 254) who allowed himself to become involved in a number of such 8L&amp;aex-oE on occasion complains that the minutes were falsified by his opponent. Cf., e.g., Entretien d'Origgne avec Hdraclide et les eveques ses coll gues sur le pgre, le fils, et l'dme, ed. J. Scherer (Cairo 1949; Publications de la Soci6t6 Fouad I; Papyrologie. Textes et documents IX; for the form of the entretien cf. esp. pp. 50-58). With respect to the mun.zara of the two RdzI our confidence in the accuracy of the account is strengthened by the manner in which Mulhammad b. ZakarlyA' breaks off the conversation when he realizes that he cannot convince his interlocutor and when he comes to feel that by continuing the exchange he may be led farther than would be prudent even in the circles in which he moved. It is the emotional strength and the theoretical weakness of any Islamic system of ethics that the allocation of ultimate responsibility remains problematical, or to put it more concretely, that the latitude of choice allowed to man is uncertain. His responsibility is required to uphold divine justice and to secure his active and conscious collaboration in the service of the community of True Believers, but it must be experi- enced, or at least formulated in a manner not to curtail the unquali- fiable omnipotence of the Lord. Muslim ethics oscillates between motiv- ation by a concern with human freedom, human guilt, human self- education, and a concern, almost a delight, in God's inscrutable and unrestrained lordship, which has often enough allowed the faithful to draw strength and self-respect from a sense of utter and almost reckless surrender and submission. The command of God and the interest of man create a tension in Islamic ethics (cf. Hourani, Ethical Value p. 205) 1 1 The kinship with Calvinism of the Muslim religious attitude has often been</page><page sequence="12">12 G. E. von Grunebaum which is not to be seen as a dialectical process to be resolved by a synthe- sis of some sort; rather the conflict is retained as a permanent incentive for man to adjust to the divine demands. It has been the tendency of what has come to be orthodox Islam to concede to man, in its ethical theory, that minimum of freedom and responsibility which is implicit in unsophisticated experience and which, at the same time, allows doctrine to stand in the face of man's pride in reason. The Koran with its many striking expressions of the existential truth of man's simulta- neous dependence and freedom has throughout the ages provided the necessary documentation for a position that renders difficult not the religious experience as such but only its credal articulation. To the imam Cacfar as-S.diq (d. 765) is ascribed a striking formulation which brings out the tendency to constitute Islam as the religion of the 'mean'.

The dictum is quoted (with the addition of numerous passages from Persian poetry representing the same point of view) in Dahxudd, Amtal, p. 1343 (-1352). On the level of everyday morality this attitude is reflected in sayings such as that of al-Baihaqi (d. 1077): dar karha guliiw kardan na-sutiida ast, "to go to extremes in one's actions does not meet with praise"; Ta'rix, ed. Sa'id Nafis! (Teheran 1319-32/1940-53), I, 18918-19. Islam recognizes the rights of man; but it places greater emphasis on the rights of God on man; and the covenant in which Adam and the angels expressly acknowledged AllAh as their Lord (Koran 7 :171/172) is used to bridge the chasm between the two concepts of morality implied in the ideas that nothing could be known about right and wrong but for God's willingness to instruct man in the positive law and that man is yet to be held responsible for a certain moral creativeness or at the very least, his spontaneous and consistent assent to a system of precepts whose rationale he is deemed unable to fathom. This covenant means the renunciation of the aspiration to organize the world under man, to make it fully man's through the exercise of reason; in return, God will give guidance and eternal bliss. But the tension persists, for man is bound and God remains free. This is why the merely psychological description remarked upon; usually, it has been overstressed. But it is worth noting that in Islam as well as in Calvin's personal outlook the view of God and the style of contemporary rulership are in harmony. Lucien F6bvre, Combats pour l'histoire (Paris 1953), PP. 227-28, explicitly connects Calvin's concept of "le don totalement gratuit et inconditionnel que rev6t (in his theology) l'octroi de la grace aux Mlus" with the concepts of royal justice and grace as these were understood in France during the sixteenth century. It is, however, only fair to indicate the reservations which H. I. Marrou, De la connaissance historique (Paris 1955), p. 267, has felt it necessary to register with regard to F6bvre's suggestion of a causal connection between the theological and the political notion; he will admit a coordination in world view and style, but no more.</page><page sequence="13">Concept and function of reason in Islamic ethics 13 of man's actions is apt to take into account the element of intellectual conviction, or choice, which the will is called upon to confirm and extra- polate (cf. al-Oazzdli as analyzed by M. Umaruddin in D. M. Donaldson, Studies in Muslim Ethics, London 1953, PP. 155-156), an analysis which may achieve a high degree of introspective subtlety while on the meta- physical plane man's claims will in general be subordinated and well- nigh suppressed in favor of the majestic amorality of the Creator of the Universe from Whom we are issued and to Whom we shall return. In Muslim ethical theory, the key problems have therefore remained relatively unchanged from its first treatment by the Mu'tazilites to its reformulation by the modernist reformers. Is it necessary to postulate divine righteousness? And is it possible to do so without interfering with His majesty? Does human righteousness presuppose an independent moral judgment? Or will it suffice to accept the Command? The pre- suppositions of those problems can be stated in the form of another question: Is a thing good because God has designated it as such or has He designated it as such because it is good? And together with this problem there arises the epistemological crux: Is reason sound? that is to say, Can normativeness be defined in terms of conformity to it so that even the will of God will be subordinate to it ? Or is it fallible, with its validity limited to the operations of the human mind as long as they do not touch the suprasensible of which an understanding may be attained only through God's willingness to dispense it ? In the one view, reason suffices to acquire a correct knowledge of God; and since God's law must be based on that same reason there must be a law and it cannot be other than it is. In the orthodox view, however, God need not have given any law and if he had given another it would have been equally obligating- regardless of its positive content and its acceptability to human reason. Where to the Mu'tazilite the identity of reason is the principle tying together the realm of God and the world of man, to the orthodox divine and human reason are not necessarily of the same order and what safe- guards the interaction of God and man is the Command with human reason confined to explication and application. Yet human reason is adequate for its purpose-to distinguish between reality and illusion and to comprehend the Creator within the limits set by Revelation itself. Fundamentally, the position of the pious modernist like Muhammad 'Abduh (d. 1905) is the same. The dependence of Islam on rational proof of its doctrines (rather than on miracles), the role allowed reason in the interpretation of the Book, the part assigned reason in distinguishing between the harmful and the beneficial-they all are recognized and stressed. But the traditional restriction reemerges when religion is</page><page sequence="14">14 G. E. von Grunebaum invoked as an instrument of control against which the results reached by reason are to be checked. In this manner a rational science, a rational ethics are encouraged without any abrogation of the primary and over- riding validity of revelation (and, one cannot help adding, of whatever other verities will seem adequately guaranteed by tradition). (On Mu- hammad 'Abduh cf. for convenience Donaldson, Studies, pp. 250-252.) It has become customary to oppose the Divine, Religious or Canon Law of the Sar'ca and the Secular Law of the Qdniin (and kindred developments) and to point to this opposition as to the method by which the Muslim societies have managed to adjust unalterable norm to the exi- gencies of the day and by which in administration, jurisprudence, social and economic relations, reason and custom could be secured their due and natural place in the organization of the community. This antithesis loses some of its rigor when it is realized that the sari'ca is, more than anything else, a presentation of religious obligations (similarly already G. Bergstri*sser in: Islamica 4/1931, 234); in this capacity, it lays claim to all, but actually structures only some areas of legislation (such as personal statute) or sections of such areas (as in the case of penal law). In actual fact, therefore, many aspects of social relations are left out, and those that are covered are treated not so much systematically as ex- emplarily with the understanding that cases not immediately decidable by analogy are to be committed to the ictihdd, the effort or initiative of the representatives of the accepted legal rites or schools. It remains true nevertheless that the rigidity of the legal tradition and the limitations inherent in purpose and source materials of the ?ari'a have compelled practically every Muslim government to supple- ment, or substitute for the ?ard'i', regulations of its own making. Insofar as these had to do with questions of judicial procedure the stipulation of the aric'a which permits the government to limit the jurisdiction of the religious judge assured the "legality" of "secular" rulings; where this legality may have seemed doubtful necessity supplied the required vindication. In any event, the power of the sovereign to create qawdnin and to enforce them was never contested in earnest. It is, however, important to realize that by its own techniques the ?arf'a maintained a much higher degree of practicality than it is as a rule credited with. It is less the so-called hziyal, or legal devices, with which ?ar'y ordinances could be circumvented by procedures justifiable from the ?ari'a itself, to which allusion needs to be made in this context; it is rather the possibility allowed the government (but not solely the govern- ment) to select in a given case from among the pertinent rulings however divergent which any of the four "orthodox" rites had come up with.</page><page sequence="15">Concept and function of reason in Islamic ethics 15 And since those divergencies, ixtildfdt, not infrequently will reflect divergent social conditions and divergent sociological aspirations, an element of pragmatic rationality was, as it were, re-injected in the official use of the Canonic Law. Its relatedness to contemporary life is, to us at least, somewhat obscured by the ?ary'a's reluctance to argue on abstract principle. Different attitudes to the concept of property and the right of the state to restrict it will not express themselves in these or comparable terms but make themselves felt in variations of opinion on specific issues such as the leeway to be granted a property owner when he wishes to build on unused ground adjoining his own-will he or will he not be required to obtain the permission of the government before breaking ground? Likewise a fundamental question of economic policy such as the right of the government to fix prices is not taken up per se or as part and parcel of a social theory; but it is dealt with by granting or refusing the muhtasib, or market-inspector, the power to control prices-this last point, incidentally, is not treated in the hand- books of Canon Law but in the manuals composed to guide the muhtasib; it is, however, relevant in assessing the role of "reason" in the legal and social sphere insofar as opinions relating to this area of the community's existence are apt to be based on the principle of istisldh, the public interest, which is accepted in greater or smaller measure by most of the law schools and which is unmistakably one point at which human "reason" is permitted to impinge on traditional or systematic considerations that would normally be viewed as the determining factors of sar'y devel- opments (for references cf. E. Ashtor-Strauss in: Rivista degli Studi Orientali 31/1956, 81-82, with literature p. 82, note I, and especially the various studies of R. Brunschvig on Mdliki law and medieval Muslim urbanism). Islam as the natural religion of man and reason as his most distinctive and most ennobling possession-only one word changed and the state- ment with all its pride would meet the aspirations of France (and most of the West) before the great revolution. And yet-no two spiritual movements could be farther apart than classical Islam and European Enlightenment. Islam uses reason (as our Middle Ages did) to find con- firmation for (fractions of) an absolute truth by logical proof; the objec- tive of thought is not the uncovering of causal connections between ever more accurately described and if need be experimentally produced pheno- mena but the establishment of the meaning of created things within God's plan of the universe; constructivism or formalism, a naive satis- faction with interpretation both anthropomorphic and anthropocentric and what can hardly be called other than a rejoicing in human fallibility</page><page sequence="16">16 G. E. von Grunebaum and limitation as a confirmation of the Lord's unfathomable supremacy direct and confine the range allowed, or rather: claimed for our rational faculties. By contrast, the reason of the Enlightenment is aggressive; it chafes at accepting any limitations in range and subject matter for its analyses; the dispelling of mystery is its peculiar task; truth held on the authority of tradition (and revelation tends to be considered nothing more than tradition) represents an especially irritating challenge to it; criticism is its primary function, the sweeping aside of time-honored errors its delight, the demonstration of the sovereignty of man its real objective. Between creation or nature and reason there exists something like a pre-established harmony-nature is so constituted as to yield its secrets to reason; in fact, what secrets there are, are such merely because reason has not as yet sufficiently been focussed on them. The world is man's not simply because man stands highest in the hierarchy of creatures and because God has adjusted the world to the requirements of his survival and rule but because it is within his power to comprehend it, to dominate it through his comprehension and by dint of reason to extend his mastery over it progressively. In Islam, man's rank of which his reason is the supreme token, testifies to God's wisdom and benevolence; man's existence glorifies his Maker; in Enlightenment (and ever since) the glory is man's whatever be the tribute he will pay to the Creator's wisdom and kindness. The limitations of reason which at the end of the eighteenth century Kant compels his contemporaries to realize exclude man-if indeed they do exclude him- only from areas into which, in the last analysis, he no longer cares to penetrate; and the amenability of the cosmos to mathematical inter- pretation largely compensates for the untrammeled enjoyment of speculative advance. In fact, to discipline reason is to increase its effec- tiveness. So where Islam finds it possible to adjust humankind to a God-centered universe thanks to the reasonableness of the divine com- mands, the West of (and since) the Enlightenment with its primary interest in man and the exploitation of his faculties makes itself more and more at home in a world which responds to rational inquiry and yields to scientific control (cf. in this context the formulation of J. Huizinga, Das Problem der Renaissance; Renaissance und Realismus, Tiibingen 1953, P. 54; and P. Hazard, La crise de la conscience europdenne, i68o- 1714, Paris 1935, pp. 121-22). As civilizations, both Islam and the West are in a position to defend and make good their claims to universality as being 'made to man's measure'; but in Islam, concerned as it is above all with God and His</page><page sequence="17">Concept and function of reason in Islamic ethics 17 rights and intentions, the measure which God is believed to have set for mankind was accepted as a conclusive self-judgment; while we of the West incessantly revise our measure in the light of accomplishment and failure and envisage adjustment to the world which we are subject- ing to ever more rapid and ever more thorough transformations, as a challenge to rationalize rather than a testimony to a reasoned order already in existence, and thus as a task rather than a fact. The peculiar kind of curiositas (a word first coined by, or at any rate preserved in Cicero, Ad Atticum II, 12, 2) which has been one of the psychological conditions of occidental research became a recognized and self-conscious motivation of man's philosophical and moral quest in the first century A.D. H. J. Mette, Curiositas, in: Festschrift Bruno Snell, Munich 1956, pp. 227-235, has studied the use made of man's 7repLpyl - the Greek term corresponding to curiositas which in this meaning must be dated to the same period-in Lukios of Patrai and Apuleius on the one hand, the Asklepios (ch. 14) and the so-called 'Address of Momos to Hermes', on the other. Philo of Alexandria (d. after A. D. 40), De migratione A brahami (Ilept &amp;7r0otXiaq), 216-218 (but cf. also the beginnings of 219 and 220), inspired by the &amp;to8eua-t of Genesis 12 :6, gives a masterly portrayal of that attitude in which we will readily recognize ourselves and to which certain Muslim figures such as the geographer al-Muqaddasi (wrote 985) would surely have experienced a similar response (cf. the Introduction to his Ahsan at-taqcdsim, ed. M. J. de Goeje, Leiden 19o6). This is the beginning of Philo's discourse: "Love of learning is by nature curious and inquisitive, not hesitating to bend its steps in all directions, prying into everything, reluctant to leave anything that exists unexplored, whether material or immaterial. It has an extraordinary appetite for all that there is to be seen and heard, and, not content with what it finds in its own country, it is bent on seeking what is in foreign parts and separated by great distances."
