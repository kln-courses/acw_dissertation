<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FASCINATION OF PANTHEISM. W. S. URQUHART. fHOUGH the wide and ever increasing fascination of s pantheism is one of the most noticeable tendencies in our own day, its attractive influence is as old as the history of thought. Goethe declared that "all antiquity thought in this way." We may, e. g., trace much of our pantheism back to the ancient philosophy of India, and discover it as the ruling conception of the sages of the Vedanta. Touched with a more exclusively religious spirit, pantheism became the foundation of much of the mysticism of the middle ages. In more modern times it reappears in the philosophy of Spinoza; and it is the world-view from which Hegel often struggles in vain to escape. In India it is still the most prevailing inspiration of thought and life. What is the secret of this fascinating power which the centuries unite in acknowledging, and which is felt to-day both in the East and in the West? How has pantheism been able to attract so many minds, and bring within the sweep of its influence men widely separated in their initial point of view, professing many different creeds, and belonging to many different races? Our attempt to give some answer to this question is entirely analytic and preparatory. It implies at the out- set, at least, no valuation of pantheism. If we can, how- ever, to any extent, discover the secret of its fascinating power, we shall then be in a better position for deciding whether it ministers to mental and moral sanity, or leads rather to intellectual bankruptcy and moral despair; Vol. XXI.-No. 3. 21</page><page sequence="2">314 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. whether it is a defence of religion, or "floats in a cloudland between theism and atheism, confessing God and making him nothing under the pretence of making him every- thing." We may consider the fascination of pantheism in its intellectual, emotional, and moral aspects. The intel- lectual man of to-day, whether metaphysically or scien- tifically inclined, prides himself on his open-mindedness. He desires to dispense with categories which tempt us to transcend their limitations or which savor of dogmatism. In regard to the deepest matters of thought, he is more negative than positive; or, where he is positive at all, the position reached must be non-exclusive, befitting an apostle of catholicity and an opponent of all definite theology. Pantheism seems to give him what he needs. It has been described as Protean, and is the most catholic of all systems of thought. It encourages a love of vague- ness by representing such vagueness as a necessity of pro- gressive thought, and this impression of its liberality has no doubt been deepened by the fact that it has in almost every age encountered the opposition of the most orthodox theologians of the Church. Even at the present day di- vergence from pantheistic theory is in some quarters taken as the measure of the almost culpable conservatism of a theological writer. Amongst the more educated peo- ple of India, with whom pantheism is a working creed, this theoretical catholicity is a constantly recurring claim. "One religion is as good as another," is one of their most favorite sayings, and the attitude on religious matters which it indicates is not unlike that of many anti-theolog- ical thinkers in western lands. We are peculiarly sensitive to-day to the limitations of the conception of personality. "To depersonalize man," said Amiel in his "Journal Intime," "is the great tendency of our age; and the tendency is not less strong now than it was when these words were written. There has been a reaction against the doctrine of the 'im- pervious self,' against Kant's excessive emphasis upon</page><page sequence="3">THE FASCINATION OF PANTHEISM. 315 individual self-determination. This attitude to human personality has affected theological speculation and mani- fested itself in a growing horror of anthropomorphism. The depreciation of personality is probably due origin- ally to crude ideas of personality,-ideas colored to a great extent by our consciousness of the limitations of our own organism. We may say that it is because the depths of the concept have not been sounded that its application is so restricted. But however this may be, the fact of its felt inadequacy remains, and we are told th at we should not have the presumption to limit God by the use of it in reference to him. Such use, it is said, is a temptation to dogmatism. For, after all, personality is a concept with a certain amount of content; it is an assertion of knowledge, and we should not assert knowledge in a sphere where none is really possible. Or if we are un- willing to go so far as to say that no knowledge is pos- sible, we should abandon ineffective and worn-out ways of thought, and make use of categories which have been already successfully applied in the region of physical sci- ence. At least, we should not block the way to the divine by the use of categories which have merely traditional value. To those whose point of view thus reveals an "antago- nism between the comparative limitation of the personal conception and the grand immensity of the impersonal," pantheism appeals. It fills up the void left by our con- sciousness of the limitations of our' most cherished concep- tions. Our sense of failure does not destroy our desire for contact with the divine immensity; and, having been baffled in one direction, we try other ways. The first sat- isfaction pantheism gives us is that it enables us to de- scribe this immensity as a unity. We have escaped from the limitations which distressed us, but we have not lost ourselves in chaos. Our intellectual abhorrence of un- resolved particularity is respected, and we are supplied with conceptions which allow us to include all details within a unitary system, or give us metaphysical justi-</page><page sequence="4">316 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. fixation for disregarding such details. If, further, we have some lingering regrets for the loss of more personal con- ceptions, we are encouraged by being told that the ele- ments of personality we have had to sacrifice are them- selves worthless and hindrances to our highest good. And, if we should have doubts as to whether we have even, un- der the guidance of pantheism, reached the proper point of view, we may be comforted by its vagueness. We are not by it tied down to any hard and fast theory of the One and the Many. We may leave this and many prob- lems like it in an attractive indefiniteness which we need not, at first, distinguish from a solution. More positively, pantheism satisfies our desire for pene- tration into real being, our craving for the permanent ele- ments in experience. The prevailing fashion of modern thought leads to a concentration of attention upon the change of the finite world; but it is not enough. The world passeth away and the lusts thereof, and in the in- tellectual sphere change is unintelligible except in relation to a permanent. We may at first attempt to find this permanent in the law of the process, but we soon find that we dislike universal evolution, and are not satisfied un- less we can find a system within which, indeed, evolution takes place, but which is not itself evolved. From a more idealistic point of view, we may say that we desire to be assured that the Real towards which our intellectual search is directed does not merely come into existence with our knowledge of it, but eternally is. Now pantheism seems to meet this tendency of thought. In one phase it offers us a totality within which there may be change, but which is not, as a whole, subject to change. Or, if we are still perplexed by the problem of change there are other phases of pantheism (especially Eastern) which invite us to disregard the reality of all variations and permutations of phenomena, and fall back upon the one and only Reality, an undifferentiated ultimate Being. All is God, we are told, and why should we be perplexed by the unreality which lies outside the Being of God. Why</page><page sequence="5">THE FASCINATION OF PANTHEISM. 317 should we beat in vain against the doors that seem shut against us, when we may know that they are shadowy, and through them may take our shadowy wayt The assertion of unity at the expense of diversity may be made in various ways. The changing phases of the world may be crushed together like the parts of a tele- scope (as in the Vedantic doctrine of Karyakaranabveda). We emerge from the temporal into the eternal, and are able to face with greater confidence the problems of creation and final issues. Any doctrine of creation which is to be ultimately satisfactory, must be monis- tically conceived,-a demand which creates many dif- ficulties. These difficulties, however, pantheism allows us to meet by the use of such phrases as ' eternal creation,' and by excusing us from further investigation into the particular character of creation, and the place left within it for human freedom and activity. When, again we turn to the other end of the process, and attempt to conceive the ultimate result in which nothing shall be left unre- lated to, or unresolved in God, pantheism seems once more to help us, only demanding that we should be willing to concentrate our attention almost entirely upon God, and regard as of no account the place which the creature may finally have in regard to him. Even the most orthodox theologian is attracted by this apparent agreement of pantheistic theory with the Pauline doctrine of God "re- conciling all things to himself." Again, when a philosopher has to meet the suggestion that his system of thought is merely a subjective and arbi- trary construction, he may base his defence upon a pan- theistic theory of knowledge. How can the thought in question be merely his thought when all thought is the thought of God'? The humble philosopher is merely the medium of truth. It is not conceivable that he should be in private possession of even a little bit of the illimitable truth of the world. In the words of Herbert Spencer, "he, like every other man, may properly consider himself as one of the myriad agencies through whom works the Un-</page><page sequence="6">318 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. known Cause, and when the Unknown Cause produces in him a certain belief, he is hereby authorized to proclaim and act out that belief." According to such a view as this, the individual is a stage in the development of the thought-activity of the universe and must give up the idea of making any individual contribution. At the same time, the thought-construction which comes to him will gain additional validity, for it will now be regarded, not as an arbitrary and individual invention, but as the pro- duct of a deeper and more universal life. Such an at- titude is an echo of the reminiscence doctrine of Plato, and is the underlying thought of the Vedanta. The philosophy which makes use of it is rapidly approaching mysticism, and is met and helped on its way by pantheism. It has been indicated above that pantheism has a special appeal to the scientific mind, and, indeed, the revival of pantheism at the present time is largely due to an action and reaction between religion and science. Science feels the need of religious conceptions while not definitely acknowledging the need even to itself. There are many thinkers who, attracted and somewhat misled by the de- velopments of modern science, have departed altogether from their ancestral beliefs. The claim of facts,-or what they call facts,-is an exclusive one. The scientific method must everywhere be rigorously applied. But yet they are not satisfied. They cannot rest in bare isolated facts or even in the laws of their connection. The world they know is after all a small one, and they are conscious of the great disproportion between the known and the unknown. The sense of mystery still remains, and they would fain admit that "nature is not all dust, but a living portion of the spheres." And so the scientists look longingly back to the country from which they have come out, and desire that the divine may still be with them in the wider world upon which they have entered. Not that the scientist would for a moment explicitly abate his claim to the a11-sufficiency of science, or look forward to a time "when the sciences shall more and more</page><page sequence="7">THE FASCINATION OF PANTHEISM. 319 cease and immediate knowledge take their place." All that he desires is that something may be added to science in as unobtrusive a way as possible, which, while not dis- turbing it, shall make it more religiously attractive, and enable him to see nature "with a divine glow upon it." It is an addition of this sort that he supposes pantheism allows him to make. It does not require him to be false to scientific method. It does not depend upon artificial relations to a dead past or problematical constructions of a shadowy future. It takes ,the universe as it is, and pre- sents it as a God who may be worshiped,-a living God of yesterday and forever, but also of to-day, who "shines upon us more splendidly now than in the times of our ignorance, . . . because larger powers of contemplation have been evolved in man." Spencer's philosophy may be taken as one example of scientific pantheism. Even his reverence for the Unknowable is pantheism in more abstract form. In any case this Unknowable plays the part of a 'sleeping partner,' so that the reverence other- wise given to it may be transferred to the world in its concreteness and its totality,-the result being pantheism in its naturalistic form. The whole tendency we have just been considering, might be described as the underpinning of empiricism by religion. Empiricism suffers normally from being ir- religious and pluralistic. Pantheism covers over these defects, and thus widens the appeal of empiricism to human nature. The latter becomes more respectable and more orthodox by taking on a religious and mystical guise. It is of course a further question whether this re- ligious dressing of mechanical conceptions may not make their paralyzing effect more deadly, and allow the prac- tical application to life of theories which might otherwise have remained merely speculative and so comparatively harmless. We must now turn to the more emotional element in the fascination of pantheism. It must be admitted that the form of thought which most easily kindles the de-</page><page sequence="8">320 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. votion of the saint and stimulates the rapture of the poet is pantheism in one or other of its forms. It is specially the religion of the dreamy and unpractical mood, and when such moods affect a mind possessed also of intel- lectual strength, it becomes the faith of the poet and the mystic. The mystic of medieval Europe joins with his Eastern brother in despising the rights of the individual and craving absorption in deity, and both are supported by pantheism of an abstract type. Immediate contact with God which is desired by the mystic, implies a conception of God as the All, and an effort to transcend the limits of the merely finite. The Neo-Platonic consciousness of being 'saved' finds here a metaphysical basis. The aim of Julian of Norwich is to "noughten all else that is made for to know and have God that is unmade. " Everywhere the aim of the devoted saint is just to be able to negate everything but God, and to possess his own soul alone, and yet not alone,-to possess it as a phase of God. If the mystic can say with sincerity, 'God is All,' he feels that he has reached the highest level of religion, and in becoming conscious of the identity between himself and God, he has a foretaste of the bliss of the eternal life. If, again, we take the more naturalistic phase of panthe- ism, and, instead of saying 'God is All,' prefer to say, 'All is God,' we find that by the immensity of this conception the deepest emotions of the poet and artist may be stirred. An immediate contact with the beauty of the world seems to be offered which shall also be an intimate communion with a divine spirit. It is essentially an emotional at- traction which we are here considering, for the appeal of the whole of nature is always more emotional than in- tellectual. The poetry of Wordsworth would seem to depend for its religious effect very largely on pantheistic emphasis. In his efforts to get away from unhealthy and even morbid subjectivity, he relies mainly on the conception of nature as divine. It is true that he never becomes entirely a pantheist, but his personal God is always tending to</page><page sequence="9">THE FASCINATION OF PANTHEISM. 321 "shade off into the impersonal." Generally, it may be said that for him the whole intricate and vast movement of nature becomes the complex working of God. Nature, breathing life and joy, is full of God, and coalesces with him into one 'mighty Being.' Every one of the minute processes of the universe, as the poet watches them with loving attention and almost religious devotion, seems to him to speak Of Life continuous, Being unimpaired That has been, is, and where it was, and is, There shall endure. Nature, conceived of as a divine unity, and regarded through the medium of intense poetic feeling, becomes, for Wordsworth, an object of religious adoration, giving ele- vation and value to his whole life-attitude. He can speak of the "bliss ineffable" with which he felt The sentiment of Being Spread o'er all that moves and all that seemeth still. It is true, of course, and, in view of any subsequent crit- ical estimation of the influence of pantheism, should be carefully kept in mind, that this rapturous mood had its intervals of dejection. He could speak of himself some- times as more like a man Flying from something which he dreads Than one who sought the thing he loves. Still these passing moods of depression do not alter the general conclusion that pantheism was to a large extent the philosophical basis of Wordsworth's poetry, that he may, therefore, be regarded as an illustration of its ap- peal to the poetic mind. And the fact that pantheism is the philosophical creed not only of Wordsworth, but of many other poets as well, would seem to some to be a presumption in its favor. At least this would be the case if we were to agree with the dictum of Mr. W. B. Yeats that only those ideas in which</page><page sequence="10">322 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. philosophy has become poetry, are likely to be permanent. There is no other system of thought which has influenced so widely and so deeply the poetic mind. It consecrates the beauty of the particular, and at the same time enables us to transfuse with emotion even the most abstract con- ceptions. It seems the natural basis of the aesthetic at- titude. Finally, we may consider the influence of pantheism in the sphere of ethics, and its appeal to men of a practical turn of mind. The desire for what, from the intellectual point of view we called permanent elements of experience, reappears here in the practical moral life. When a man is striving after the good, he is nerved to the struggle by the feeling that the good is not something which he has now to bring into existence for the first time by his own individual effort. It must be something which has been in existence from all time, and unless it is now, in principle, at least, a reality, it cannot effectively summon him to service, to whatever extent it may still await a special detailed setting in his particular moral experience. Here becomes apparent the value of an ideal of which we frequently find traces in Eastern pantheism,-the idea that progress consists, not in moral change, but in the recognition of that which is already real. It is also an emphasis of the Platonic doctrine of reminiscence in the moral sphere, and an ethicizing of the more modern say- ing that "the Absolute has no seasons, but all at once bears its leaves, fruit, and blossoms." A danger of course lies very near. The idea just re- ferred to may be so emphasized as to withdraw our at- tention from the necessity of progress. That such a con- sequence may follow is not however our present concern. We are simply noting the presence in pantheism of. an idea which fascinates because it seems at first sight to give us assurance of the permanence of moral values. Our belief in the everlasting reality of goodness has an appar- ently firmer basis when it can rest on the pantheistic doc- trines of the permanence of the whole, and the ultimate</page><page sequence="11">THE FASCINATION OF PANTHEISM. 323 illusoriness of everything that lies distinct from the nature of God. It is of course a further question how far in pantheism the nature of the whole or of God is indeed ethically conceived, but it is a question which belongs to criticism rather than to analysis. Again, the discipline which mystical pantheism inculcates appeals strongly to the man who is in earnest about the perfecting of his own character. He is summoned to rise through the various grades of Being, to pass through the 'purgative life,' the 'illuminative life' to the 'unitive life,' and the very de- scription of these stages, or of others like them, inspires him with the idea of progress being slowly but surely made. The pantheistic emphasis upon the whole of things, when applied to the world of human society, calls us further to the surrender of merely individual and selfish aims, and the annihilation of desires connected with the continuance of a separate personality. It offers us a mode of thought which awakens some of the noblest im- pulses of our nature, and seems to stand in attractive con- trast to the sickly other-worldliness which would make salvation consist only in the saving of one's own soul. It encourages a man to look beyond the narrow confines of his own family, his own community, his own race. Be- cause God is All, and All is God, therefore all men are divine and all men become proper objects of service. "Humanity is incarnated in each man, but each man is only realized so far as he passes out of himself into the wider life of humanity."' While one phase of pantheism might thus conceivably be used in support of ideals of mutual service, we should notice on the other hand its connection with social life of an entirely different character. In certain of its phases, it has been used as a refuge when inequalities were most glaring, political life most unpromising, and moral effort, generally, despairing and weak. These conditions may be noted in connection with the Vedanta philosophy and with Stoicism. Medieval mysticism, also, which is an-</page><page sequence="12">324 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. other form of pantheism, seems to have arisen in circum- stances of gloom. Amalric of Bena, one of the earlier mys- tics, lived at a time when all the vigor of individual life was crushed out under the double despotism of the Church and the Empire, and a period of revival in mysticism set in during the fourteenth century when Europe was still suffering from the effects of the devastation wrought by the Holy Wars. The explanation is that pantheism, in one of its Protean variety of forms, offers most of all an escape from present troubles. It seems to promise a relief from the calamities of life, however great they may be. Its popularity in- creases therefore with the severity of the calamities. Its world-view enables us to negate or at least to forget the worry of detail, and the vexations of ordinary life. It affords a metaphysical justification for withdrawing from the responsibilities of society, and sometimes in the hurry of our escape we may not distinguish between flight and victory. If we are passively inclined, temporary relief may wear the guise of permanent conquest, and pantheism at least promises us this temporary relief. We may, like the ostrich, be simply burying our heads in the sand, but at least the sand is provided, and occasionally even human beings may be grateful for it. Whatever our further critical estimation of the value of pantheism may be, the analysis of its fascination, under- taken in the foregoing pages, will leave us with the im- pression that it is a force to be reckoned with. It has always been regarded as such a force, but the attitude towards it in the Christian centuries has been curiously varied, and might be described as one of mingled distrust and welcome. A writer of forty years ago could say, "Christianity and Pantheism must be reconciled, other- wise it will be the worse for Christianity. " And this com- plex attitude was further illustrated a year or two ago in the extraordinary interest and opposition aroused by an attempt to interpret Christianity from an entirely pantheistic point of view,-an attempt which proceeded on</page><page sequence="13">THE FASCINATION OF PANTHEISM. 325 the assumption that the truth of pantheism was indis- putable, and its promises altogether trustworthy. This assumption, however, was not received with so great a degree of unanimity as to warrant us in thinking that, after all the warring of the creeds, we had reached a new era of pantheistic peace. Rather is the controversy still with us, and at the present time we seem again called upon to examine the claims of pantheism, and to inquire whether it can honestly and permanently satisfy the vari- ous needs of our human nature, whether it increases or decreases our sense of the value of life. We have an- alyzed its fascination and indicated some of its promises, but, before we surrender ourselves to its influence, we have to ask whether we are here dealing with the apparent or the real, with trustworthy or untrustworthy promises. In conclusion, I would ask, Is it not at least possible that the vagueness, by which pantheism attracts those who are unwilling to hold to any fixed form of faith, may be- come so predominant as to involve almost intellectual bankruptcy? May it not be the case that the unity by which it attempts to hold together the diversity of the world, falls apart from the unity, disappears into the region of abstractionism, and leaves the diversity to de- generate into mere naturalism, determinism, and fatalism? Is there here permanent satisfaction for the emotional rapture of the poet or the mystical devotion of the saint, or may there not be danger of repeated reaction, having effect in helplessness before the actual problems of the world? Finally, is it not a question worthy of consider- ation whether the expansion of sympathy which pantheism produces in the sphere of ethics, may not be more than counterbalanced by its failure to give an adequate ex- planation of suffering, its depreciation of moral distinc- tions, its rigid determinism and denial of progress, its disregard of both the present and future worth of the individual? Under its influence may we not put contem- plation before conflict, and care more for flight than for victory ?</page><page sequence="14">326 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. Such inquiries are, however, beyond the scope of this article, which will have fulfilled its purpose if it to any extent prepares the way for them. W. S. URQUHART.
