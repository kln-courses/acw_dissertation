<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rock art and prehistory. Edited by Paul Bahn and Andr√©e Rosenfeld. Oxbow Monograph 10. The Short Run Press, Exeter. 1991. ISBN 0 946897 32 8. Pp. VII + 147. UK Pounds 18.00 (posted). The volume comprises an introduction by Rosenfeld and Bahn and 15 papers by individual authors, seven of which deal with Aboriginal rock art. Several contributors discuss theoretical issues. Bahn questions the notions that European Palaeolithic art was used in hunting magic or to store information on the environment. He argues such concepts, if valid, would explain but a small proportion of the art. Smith and Bullen both challenge the idea that only men in Aboriginal society performed sacred rites. Smith's synthesis of the anthropological literature shows that, at least in some regions, both sexes conducted love magic and increase ceremonies. She urges researchers to rethink women's role as artist since evidence indicates that women had exclusive rights to produce rock art at some sites. Bullen analyses female figures in the art of Deaf Adder Creek and the Laura region and concludes that 'certain aspects of the figures [...] suggest that women were acknowledged as creative beings whose very images were imbued with power' (p.56). Franklin and Rosenfeld review the concept of a widespread and homogeneous Panaramitee style in Pleistocene Australia. Franklin analyses figures from art sites across Australia and concludes that the Panaramitee style represents a valid entity although variations of this style between sites suggest the presence of regional variants. Rosenfeld, however, does not view the Panaramitee as a valid style due to major regional differences in motif types. She thus concludes there were several artistic regions in the Pleistocene. Forge poses the question: 'are hand stencils art?'. Using ethnographic data, he argues stencils are not part of an art system per se. As such, researchers ought to exclude stencils from stylistic analyses. Chesney summarises Raphael's ideas, methods, theoretical underpinning and interpretations of European Palaeolithic art. She stresses the potential contribution that Raphael's approach can make to the study of rock art. Three articles discuss methodological issues. Layton examines problems in identifying and interpreting art figures for which no ethnographic information is available. Layton's case study shows that what one sees in a maze of lines depends on lighting conditions and observer's preconceptions. Clegg also explores ways in which subjectivity affects reliability in recording and interpretation. He encourages researchers to identify interpretations that creep in their own work. Officer argues that the motif category (*anthropomorph' is inadequate to study stylistic variations. He shows how different criteria are currently applied to classify non-figurative and figurative motifs and argues that relying on formal attributes would provide a logically consistent scheme for classifying both kinds of motifs. Five articles present empirical analysis of rock art. Prous attempts to define a stylistic sequence at a rocksheiter in Brazil using several dating methods. The study involves the use of new techniques and interdisciplinary work while also relying on potentially misleading concepts including the assumption that only one style was in use at any one time. Kosasih documents the nature of Indonesian prehistoric rock art. He advances explanations for the production of some art, although these are not convincing in my opinion. For instance, Kosasih suggests that 'the picture of centipedes may be a reminder to people that they are dangerous' (p.68). The value of this article lies in its synthesis of the nature of Indonesian rock art. McDonald outlines changes in art styles of the Sydney region and relates these to changes in stone artefact technology. She questions the notion that technological shifts are linked to stylistic changes. McDonald proposes an engraving sequence for the shelter art and presents dating evidence for the earliest phase. Her analysis relies on challenging concepts including contemporaneity of different styles. Johnston analyses the distribution of Irish petroglyphs attributed to the period 2500-1500 b.c. Environmental variables are examined to establish the function of the art. Results suggest an association between petroglyphs and settlement sites as well as agriculturally suitable soils. Brown investigates changes in Tasmanien art and other prehistoric assemblages. He concludes that changes occurred in the nature of association between painted art sites and occupation deposits and that there is no evidence for a Pleistocene antiquity of Tasmanien engravings. Brown suggests that designs of body cicatrices, motifs painted on bark and engravings 'represent a statewide art style practiced by Tasmanien Aborigines in at least the late Holocene' (p. 105). It is a most useful article for its synthetic qualities. In summary, the volume has two major strengths. First, it presents readers with a range of papers that question old concepts and propose new ones. Second, the volume provides synthesis of the archaeology of art from several regions. However, some authors rely on dubious concepts, most notably that only one style can exist at a given place and time. Overall, the volume reflects a generally progressive community of rock art analysts and is of particular relevance to rock art scholars in Australia.
