<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Gopolian Echoes in Sologub's The Petty Demon: Are they imitative of or organic to Gogol's Dead Souls?' Harry Snyder Andrei Belyi states that "in the very mature works of Sologub, his prose, as it were, attracts to itself the music of Gogol', not being essential to the prose, but being salutary to its blood; Sologub rejuvenates himself with Gogol'."2 In his introduction to The Petty Demon, translated by Andrew Field (Random House, New York, 1962), Ernest J. Simmons affirms that "the world of reality in this provincial town where Peredonov teaches school has its counterparts in earlier Russian literature. Certain works of Gogol', Dostoevsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and even Chekhov have con- tributed something to its description, its mores, and its inhabitants." Andrew Field in his preface draws his own parallel between Gogol' and Sologub: "Both Gogol' and Sologub have the ability to reduce life to its most elemental and ludicrous components ... Unlike Gogol',3 however, Sologub presents an alternative to the repugnant spirit that pervades his novel. This alternative is the poignant affair between Lud- mila Rutilova and a young boy.Sasha Pyl'nikov."4 Feeling little satisfaction, however, in the wake of such literary generalities, one is prompted to ask just how precisely or to what extent can one writer be indebted or related to another? Or to consider the title of this article: Are the echoes of one writer in another imitative or organic? By imitative echoes one should understand those similarities in prose which result from conscious manipulative reproduction, having nothing to do with elements of the deep structure of prose formed by the dyna- mism of psychic numinosity and hence organic to the creative process-in the sense that they issue from archetypal thinking that produces both image and emotion.5 With this criterion in mind, one would be hard pressed to identify any writer in the Gogolian school whose psychic thrust is organically related to that of Gogol"s prose. And, if this be the case, one might correctly adduce that Gogolian echoes throughout Russian literature are, indeed, largely imitative, resulting primarily from a literary construct predicated on what Victor Erlich understands as a "tendency toward minute, 'metonymic' description, toward a lavish use of external detail, above and beyond the call of the story itself."6 This would imply, then, that writers of the Gogolian school have imitated certain techniques of Gogol''s prose, but have not written from the same dynamic thrust issuing from the archetypal thinking that was the matrix of Gogol"s creativity. It is the purpose of this article to show, firstly, how Sologub consciously echoed Gogol"s prose' and, secondly, to show how Sologub missed the upward burst of psychic 'elan of Gogol"s effusive lyricism with its atmosphere of human encouragement, understanding only that part of Gogol"'s thought that relates to what Zinaida Saxovskaja has formulated as the "metaphysics of nonbeing."8 With a force peculiar to his own creativ- 189</page><page sequence="2">ity, Sologub reversed the direction of Gogol"s prose of metaphysical ascent to invoke a world of metaphysical descent. Certain writers in the Gogolian school have successfully echoed Gogol"s humor or aspects of it (non sequitor, hyperbole, label sticking, absurdity, grotesque, etc.) which is "romantic," not compatible with "realistic" Russian literature; but yet once again operative in the twentieth century. Sologub, in his turn, imitated techniques of Gogol'"s humor-a link between the exterior of Sologub's world with the floor plan of Gogol"s- by presenting characters as grotesque caricatures where the mechanical, jerky movements that dehumanize, cause the reader to lose his equili- brium, which then causes him to laugh from embarrassment. The gro- tesque movements of the notary Gudaevskij in Sologub's town merit a prolonged chuckle and might easily have been performed in a Gogolian landscape. It should be noted, however, that mental proclivities that are perverse to varying degrees such as paranoia, sadism, transvestism and necrophilia, all of which are incorporated into Sologub's humor, are almost foreign to Gogol"s humor which is based on tongue-in-cheek satire and downright slapstick.9 The tenor of Sologub's "Author's Foreword to the Second Edi- tion," "Author's Foreword to the Fifth Edition," "Author's Foreword to the Seventh Edition," and "Dialogue (To the Seventh Edition)" imme- diately brings to mind Gogol"s laborious effort to vindicate his own writing, and especially Dead Souls. These three "Forewords" with the "Dialogue" read like an extended parody on Gogol"s metaphysical anguish in Dead Souls, Dead Souls, Part Two, and Selected Passages. In the "Author's Foreword to the Second Edition," Sologub states; "I was not obliged to contrive and invent on my own. Everything that relates to the narrative incidents, and everyday life and the psychology in my novel is based on very precise observations, and I had sufficient 'models' for my novel in my proximity." B. Yu Ulanovskaja maintains [Cf. A. A. Izmailov, "F. Sologub o svoikh proizvedeniiakh," Birzhevye vedomosti (Oct. 16, 1906), p. 3.] that the prototype for Peredonov was a certain Ivan Ivanovich Strakhov who was a teacher in the Velikie Luki district in the late 1880's. Ulanovskaja also claims to identify models for Volodin and Varvara "O prototipakh romana F. Sologub Milkii bes," Russkaia literatura, Vol. XII, No. 3 (1969), pp. 181-84. Together with these prototypes for The Petty Demon there may be still another prototype for Peredonov: he is Ci"ikov's teacher for whom we have no name. It is ironic that the prose in Dead Souls that may have furnished Sologub with his prototype for Peredonov, about whose earlier life we know almost nothing,'1 should be found precisely in the flashback of Cicikov's childhood which is provided to aid the reader understand how certain events in childhood molded, as it were, poor Cicikov's character." CSiikov's teacher was a great lover of quiet and good conduct and could not bear clever and sharp-witted boys: it seemed to him that they 190</page><page sequence="3">must infallibly be laughing at him. (303.) Sologub echoes the prejudices of Cirikov's teacher and then expands it to include some interchange be- tween Peredonov and his students: In Peredonov's classes people had truly been laughing a great deal lately-and not because he enjoyed it. On the contrary, Peredonov was irritated by children's laughter. But he couldn't restrain himself from saying something superfluous or indecent. First he would tell a silly anecdote, then he would start to mildly tease someone. In a class one could always find those who were happy for the opportunity to create disorder, and they would produce a furious bout of laughter at every trick of Peredonov's. (135.) Peredonov, of course, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia; its fears are permanently lodged in his brain. Left alone with Versina, Pere- donov was pleased that the others had left, otherwise, to be sure, they might have started laughing again. Although he knew probably that they weren't laughing at him, nevertheless, a feeling of annoyance lingered on inside him, just the way the pain lingers on and grows after touching a stinging nettle, even though the nettle is long removed. (40-41.)12 Cirikov's teacher gives "good marks in all subjects to the boy who doesn't know his "a" from a hole in the wall, as long as he conducts himself meritoriously; but as for the lad in whom [he sees] an evil spirit [a petty demon?] and a mocking air, [he'll] give him a zero, even though he could give pointers to Solon!" (303.) Cf. footnote 12. Peredonov has similar sentiments in grading papers. The headmaster severely upbraids Pere- donov for giving a grade of four to the paper of his own son which was written poorly while giving a grade of one to Adamenko's paper which was done with complete satisfaction. (177.) Peredonov hates Adamenko for spoining Volodin's chance, presumably, to marry Adamenko's sister. Cirikov's teacher wore a three-cornered cap which he kept obseq- uiously tipping to the headmaster-a sycophantic gesture which, in turn, nurtures a fawning behavior in Cirikov: "... as soon as the bell sounded he [young CiTAikov] would make a headlong dash and fetch the teacher's three-cornered cap (that's what this teacher actually wore, a three- cornered cap) [sic] ... and would try to come within the teacher's ken at least three times as the latter walked along, incessantly taking his cap off to the schoolmaster. (304.) In The Petty Demon the three-cornered cap has a modest begin- ning in an atmosphere of fear, then develops into a symbol behind which Peredonov can hide his paranoia, and finally into a symbol of authority that lets him vent his sadism. At first, Peredonov explains to Avinovitsky that he has an official cap with a cockade, but that he doesn't always wear it. (101.) Then having decided to wear only this cockade, Peredonov takes it off in front of the church and crosses himself three times for everyone to see (114.)--one time for each corner of the cap and perhaps three times to match young Ciiikov's trying to come within his teacher's ken at least three times as the latter walked along. Ci1ikov's teacher's wrath was provoked by any student who so much as dared to stir in his seat or twitch an eyebrow. He would drive the 191</page><page sequence="4">insolence of insubordination out of such a student by making him scrape his knees raw on the floor. (303.) Standing on the knees also becomes standard punishment in The Petty Demon. However, here, the sadism extends to relationships between both sexes. Not wanting to stand in the corner for eavesdrop- ping, Mila Adamenko proposes to his sister that he should stand on his knees at her feet with the result that she suddenly pushes him away. (134.) After catching Saga in a dress in Ljudmila's bedroom, Kokovkina orders him to stand on his knees. (245.) And later, Saga says obstinately, with a look of someone who is being unjustly offended that Kokovkina wants to punish him some more because he hadn't begged her forgiveness and would have even stayed on his knees the whole evening. (247.) Punishment on one's knees takes a sadistic turn during the moments of mounting passion in the ravine between Saga and Ljudmila: she tells Saga to get down on his knees and then with an imperious cruelty on her face she commands him to kiss her nice little white feet. (232.) This sadism is brought full circle back to Peredonov when he "kept glancing at Saga and it was particularly pleasant for him to see him on his knees, like someone being punished ... He was swarthy and shapely and this was particularly noticeable when he was on his knees... " (122-123.) Stanley J. Rabinowitz sees the Ljudmila-Sa-a affair as a proving ground for Saga's sexual maturation which reaches a climax against Ljud- mila's sadism in the ravine. Ljudmila's suggesting that they go hammer nails at her place immediately truncates her sadism in the ravine, but eerily hints at Saga's cruxifixion by her hands. Ljudmila effects Saga's mental corruption which could lead to physical destruction: through the narra- tor's omniscience, Saga asks himself how he could offer his blood and his body in sweetest sacrifice to her desires and his own shame. (239.) Rabinowitz states brilliantly that, "if peredonovshchina-the constant slippage of all phenomena into an intensified state of corruption and decay-represents the major components of Sologub's philosophical vision in The Petty Demon, then it is Sasha's psychological metamorphosis which demonstrates the potency of this vision.13 All this imagery that Sologub has borrowed from Gogol' is similar in pictorial reproduction, but the psychic intent with which Sologub seems to develop it is dissimilar from Gogol"'s. Gogol' created the image of Cidikov's teacher so that when the teacher was dismissed [Peredonov is dismissed] for stupidity or some other failing [Peredonov's faculties were dull and slow. (38.)] and turned to drink [Peredonov has been swilling since the start of the novel], he could unmask young Ciiikov as a nig- gardly little opportunist. But Gogol' with a concern for mankind beyond the ugly mugs who are misbehaving in his chief provincial town, tells us how in the town of Cidikov's youth, all the clever and witty fellows whom the teacher had persecuted, "learning of their teacher's pitiful plight immediately took up a collection for him, even selling many things they needed." (305.) Cf. footnote 12. Despite Gogol"'s generally low opinion of fellow man's morality in his provincial town which is hammered home in the seemingly endless ironic passages in Dead Souls, Gogol' can still invest his characters with the purest altruism. The fact that Ci~ikov's dismissed 192</page><page sequence="5">teacher in his despair breaks down and cries and Peredonov to whom no one shows any milk of human kindness, in his insanity, commits murder suggests that Sologub echoes Gogol', but missing Gogol"s pity, showed no mercy towards Peredonov and turned him into a spectre of evil. (The author Pursewarden in Lawrence Durrell's Mountolive has jotted down this oracular thought for his novel: "All great books are excursions into pity.") The imagery, then, is more than a word picture; the emotion behind the picture very distinctly makes a pronouncement on the ethical stance of both authors. There are striking similarities between the scene in the gymnasium church where Peredonov is sexually aroused by looking "at this girl in disguise," and the garden scene which reveals Peredonov's sexual sadism: standing a while in both places Peredonov grows sad in the garden and melancholy in church; in the garden the faint tender sounds (we presume there is music in the church) wafted through the soft "dark air" of evening which induce "sorrow" and arouse "sweet dreams" of erotic direction parallel the "pleasantness" for Peredonov in seeing the "sorrow" in the "dark eyes" of Sasa. Not only do Ljudmila's and Sasa's moments of frolicking love involve the sadism of standing on the knees, this sexual position of being on the knees has direct ties with "ladies in the most seductive situations" of the garden scene and "it was particularly pleasant for him to see Sasha on his knees, like someone being punished" of the church scene-all of which seem to suck Ljudmila and Saga into the vortex of Sologub's metaphysical evil. The secret perversities of Ljudmila and Saga (their love is based on self-gratification), especially her dreams, pull both of them into the sphere of Peredonov's wanton sexual desires making their affair subiect to the same gravitational pull toward the nether world as is the action of the "main plot"; the emotions of the Ljudmila-and-Sasa episode deny them absolute beauty int he evil of their maneuvers just as the thoughts of Peredonov deny him the possibility of spiritual growth in the evil of his insanity. Thus, textual evidence suggests contrary to early and even recent criticism that Ljudmila's and Sasa's metaphysical world and Peredonov's metaphysical world are one and the same. For the purpose of this article, then, which is to determine whether Sologub's echoes of Gogol' in The Petty Demon are organic to Gogol"s prose in Dead Souls, there need be no distinction made between evil and good parts or even irrelevant parts in Sologub's novel. Ciwikov's father's tweaking young CiOikov's ear follows the same pattern of imagery as the punishment of standing on the knees; whereas Gogol' mentions it only once as a torment that habitually took place in order to muster pity for young Cicikov, Sologub develops it into recurring imagery to express increasing sadistic aggression. When Grulina tells Peredonov that he talks enough nonsense to make a person's ears wilt, he replies harshly that if they're going to wilt, they should be plucked off. (69.) To Saga's question whether Ljudmila intended to put him into a jar, Ljudmila answers that she plucked him by the ears and tossed him back into the water. (161.) During moments of playing rough house, Ljudmila plucks Saga's ear to the point that he doubles over in pain. Ljudmila then 193</page><page sequence="6">takes him by the other ear. (166.) Finally at the masquerade someone shouted that they've got the geisha by the ears. (262.) Ciwikov's teacher "hated Krylov with a mortal hate because the fabulist had said: 'For my part go ahead and sing, if to your work but skill you bring."' (303.) He was dismissed for his stupidity! Krylov's fable "The Liar" (one of the everlasting copybook max- ims before young Criiikov was: Tell No Lies) brings fear to Peredonov because the day after he had lied on a high scale about the Princess he had had to read Krylov's fable in class. (222.) The following textual comparisons with a similarity of pictorial image or of subject matter, but which are consistently and predictably dissimilar in psychic projection suggest that Sologub consciously imitated Gogol'; but whereas Gogol''s vision is directed away from his ground plan optimistically upward promising his reader an ascent beyond self to God and his angels, Sologub's vision is pessimistically cast down-a descent that leaves the reader without hope and plunges him immediately toward the nether world to the Devil and his petty demons. The amount of imagery relating to nature in Sologub's prose would seem to indicate that Sologub has more of an ax to grind to impose his metaphysical stance than does Gogol'. This also seems to be borne out by the fact that weather and conditions of the landscape pass through Pere- donov's consciousness constantly as a direct threat to his existence. Gogol' uses this technique only infrequently in the form of a simile: "Chichikov began to feel ill at ease and out of sorts, every whit as if he had set a beautifully polished boot into a filthy, stinking puddle.. ." (219.) But only a moment before Chichikov had been soaring! The Petty Demon is a novel that presses the psyche downward: the heavy and threatening atmosphere constantly frightens the characters. In Dead Souls a bouncing levity rebounds from the prose: "and the carriage was off, bouncing over the cobbles [and it] was at last rolling along on soft earth." (21.) In Sologub's town "at rare intervals the drozhky would reverberate along the stone pavement only to sink in the sticky mud once more in the unpaved streets." (56.) Nature imagery frightens and depresses Peredonov: "The street had settled down in the gloom ... It was dark, melancholy and damp. Heavy clouds were wandering overhead." (208.) The adjectives "dark," "damp" and "heavy" invoke a mood of depression and the adjective "melancholy" places this description within "pathetic fallacy." Sologub attributes human emotions that arise from fear of uncertainty to the night and to the trees of the Rutilov garden. Any emotions predicated on the ramifications of fear are in perfect keeping with fear itself, the pivotal emotion of The Petty Demon: "Meanwhile, night, soft, rustling with ominous whispering sounds ... descended all around ... The trees from the Rutilov garden were growing suspiciously dark and whispering about something in the depths of the yard. (63.) The branches of trees in particular threaten Peredonov's mental stability: one rustles, shrinks into itself, turns black, caws and flies off into the distance (203); and Peredonov takes an ax to trees that he thinks are 194</page><page sequence="7">harboring spies (728); he even denounces the wood-poachers for having deprived him of switches for the steambath and for properly rearing children (more sadism). In Gogol"s prose, even in satire, trees offer solace and represent the purpose given them by archetypal thinking. It is interesting to note that in Gogol"s tongue-in-cheek satire that the newspaper reports these trees as they should be at some future time which has the effect of offering relief to an otherwise absurd impression from the humor: "However, although these trees were no higher than reeds, the newspaper ... had said of them that, 'Our city has been graced . . . by a park of shady trees whose spreading boughs provide coolness on a sultry day."' (9.) Peredonov expresses an antithetical position to any municipal beautification by say- ing that the grass in his town is a disgrace and should be pulled out. (202-203.) Nor does nature gaze kindly on Peredonov: threatening omens come from everywhere, the sky is frowning, the wind is moaning and the trees are unwilling to provide shade. (212.) Gogol' can make his ground plan "depressing," but he will com- pensate with psychic relief either through lyrical emotions that readjust what is "wrong" in the "reality" of his ground plan or through the alterna- tive in a negative statement-the negative impression is usually mitigated by the "off-swing" into some metaphor. At Manilov's there is a depress- ingly bluish tint to the pine forest and the day is of a dove-gray hue, such as one finds looking at the worn uniforms of garrison soldiers who are peaceful, but never entirely sober on Sundays. (24.) Gogol' doesn't allow this imagery, as Sologub would, to pass through Manilov's consciousness or through Ciwikov's conscious thinking about Manilov's character. What Gogol' does do, is to link the forest and weather with Manilov by stating several pages further that in Manilov's study, "the walls were done in some charming bluish tint [the pine forest] on the grayish side [the weather]" (34-35.) But Manilov like the soldiers in uniforms of dove-gray tinge (the dove is peaceful) is also peaceful. The depression from the pine forest and weather is lifted by Manilov's proposal, "that it would really be a fine thing if we were to live thus together, under the same roof; or if, in the shade of some elm or other we were to philosophize about some subject or other, were to go in for something profound [it's satire, but it still soothes]." (42.) Or again, Manilov says, "if one had some scientific pursuit or other that would kind of stir the soul, lend one wings to kind of soar with, as it were .. ." (31) And what within the social amenities is a grander excelsior than the "much waving of handkerchiefs on the part of his hosts [the Manilovs], who finally had to raise themselves on tiptoes to watch their departing guest?" (43.)~4 As Peredonov's jumbled vision sees nature as more and more derisively mocking, so does his insanity grow more and more chronically acute. The wind in The Petty Demon is a part of this picture of nature gone haywire: "The wind was making the wallpaper stir. It whispered with a soft, ominous, rustling sound, and faint semi-shadows slithered over its colorful patterns. 'A spy is hiding there, behind the wallpaper,' Peredonov thought. 'The wicked people!' he thought with melancholy." 195</page><page sequence="8">(227.) As events turn macabre, they also turn against Peredonov making him lose his sense of reality-things become rearranged like the order in dream-logic: The west was dying out. A cloud wandered across the sky, roaming and stealing along-clouds have soft footwear-and spying. A dark sheen was smiling mysteriously around its dark edges. The shadows of houses and bushes wavered, whispered ... Meanwhile on this earth in this dark and eternally hostile town, all the people he met were wicked and scornful. Everything was united in a general antagonism toward Pere- donov. The dogs were roaring with laughter at him while the people greeted him with barking. (216.) Both the dogs in Sologub's prose and the dogs of Korobowka's yard are anthropomorphic: the dogs that laugh at Peredonov exhibit their human behavior through his insanity which threatens both himself and the reader; the dogs of Korobowka's courtyard are heard barking from a distance and then through the imagination of Gogol"s extended metaphor they become singers greeting Cicikov with the levity of their canine choir- and the reader, in turn, feels the joyous welcome. (50.) Peredonov's paranoia constantly envisages the weather as unpleas- ant and the sky as frowning at him. The crows were cawing as if they meant to tease him and to prophesy still worse troubles to come. (152.) In Gogol''s mythical Russia there are crests of pines in the mist, the ringing of church bells and crows flying thickly against a horizon with no end. (294.) The crows seem, as it were, a finishing touch to Gogol"s painting of nostalgia that encourages the mind to romanticize. Night forces Peredonov to walk more slowly amidst rustling sounds from the grass along the fences that rendered everything suspi- cious and strange: "All things were strangely and surprisingly concealed behind the darkness as though a different nocturnal, that was incompre- hensible and hostile to man had awakened in them." (174.) For Gogol', night itself is exhilarating: "But the night! ... Heavenly powers! What a night is being consummated up in the heaven's heights! And the air, and the sky, distant, lofty, so unencompassably, harmoniously and radiantly spreading there, in its inaccessible profundity!" (297.) In Gogol', the moonlight falls upon the ground like kerchiefs of white linen and under the oblique moonbeams the wooden roofs gleam like flashing metal. (296.) Even gossip reports that Ciwikov had been meeting the governor's daughter in a garden by moonlight. (242.) When Ljudmila and Sasa enter nature, they wind up in a ravine: "The warm air, melancholy and motion- less caressed them... The sun, like an invalid, spread a murky light... Dry leaves lay submissive and dead on the dark earth."'5 Unlike CiZwikov ("evidently even the Chichikovs, for a few moments in their life, turn into poets." (214.)), Peredonov makes no attempt to leap above the landscape of his own soul. Sologub voices the same attitude in his poetry: benevolent death is the positive pole of his world and hatred of everything sunny and vital to life's energy is the negative pole. For Sologub the sun either doesn't function or functions perversely: "Evening was approaching and everything was illuminated 196</page><page sequence="9">with a mournful light filtering through the murky overcast and seemingly from a source other than the sun." (97.); "For some reason the sun kept hiding behind the clouds. Was it spying on him?" (212) In Gogol"s prose, the sun is in its correct place in the sky; "The sun is high in the heavens." (297.) or shining as it should; "clear pond gleaming in the sun." (297.) And there is the incomparable beauty of sunlight in Plju-kin's overgrown garden: "Getting under one of those leaves, God alone knows how, the sun would suddenly transform it into a thing of transparency and fire that shone wondrously amid this dense darkness." (139.) In Gogol"s world, any human trick can be mollified by the calm and beauty of nature-by the warmth of the rising sun. Gogol' likens the stunning effect of gossip to a schoolboy up whose nose, while he is asleep his schoolmates have poked a "hussar"-a paper filled with snuff. But this dirty trick is mitigated by the calming effect of nature when, after a time... he make(s) out the walls lit by the indirect rays of the rising sun ... and the arrival of morning as it peeps in through the windows, to the accompaniment of the awakened forest, resounding with thousands of bird voices, and a glimpse of a shining river, disappearing here and there in glittering eddies, between slender reeds and with clusters of naked urchins everywhere, egging on one another to dive in ... (239.) The young bathers doing what is natural in their euphoria are a perfect complement to Gogol"s impressionistic idyll. Sologub, however, allows Ljudmila to express her perverted sexuality in a dream of erotic sadism in which beautiful, naked and strong, young boys are taking turns whipping each other before her. (144.) This action takes place in what Sologub calls a magnificent chamber with low, heavy vaults which seems incorrect in so far as a gothic cathedral with its heaven-reaching arches is magnificent; low, heavy vaults are not. And one wonders how Ljudmila living in a reality dictated to her by her neuroses can at the same time show "an independence of mind, invulnerability to societal forces, and control over self, situation, and destiny" as Judith M. Mills maintains in her recent article "Expanding Critical Contexts: Sologub's Petty Demon," SEEJ, Vol. 28, Spring 1984: p. 21. Both Gogol' and Sologub posture their metaphysical stance in the description of edifices in their towns: Gogol"s angle of vision scans frequently the upper reaches of architecture; Sologub inverts architec- ture's rising lines. In Sologub's town, "a melancholy lull hung over the streets and it seemed that the pitiful buildings, hopelessly decrepit, tim- idly hinting at the impoverished and boring life lurking within their walls, had originated for nothing." (97.) Gogol', on the other hand, celebrates the joy of a child in discovering a new town for the first time: ... it was a gladsome thing for me to be driving up for the first time to some unfamiliar place ... the curious eye of the child would discover a great deal . . . Whether it were a stone government building of the familiar style of architecture, sticking up all by its lonesome amid a cluster of the one-story little houses..,. or a well-rounded cupola, covered all over with white sheet iron, rearing over a new church whitewashed so that it was as white as snow ... (135-136.) 197</page><page sequence="10">Architecture as well as nature produces fear in Peredonov's consciousness: The public prosecutor's house strengthened and concentrated in Pere- donov those oppressive sentiments into a feeling of melancholy fear. And it was precisely as though that house possessed an angry and spiteful appearance. The high roof hung frowningly over the windows and forced them down towards the ground. Both the wooden trim and the roof had been painted a bright and cheerful color at one time, but time and rain had rendered the paint gloomy and gray. The gates, enormous and heavy, higher than the house itself, seemed to be installed in order to repulse enemy attacks and were bolted at all times. A chain rattled behind the gates and a dog barked at every passerby in a deep bass [recall the deep bass in the canine choir at Koroboaka's who welcome Cicikov]. (98.)16 Gogol' imparts to his children neither the corrupted vision nor the unclean thoughts of adulthood: the children perform with the naivet6 of childhood experience; Koroboaka allows a little serf girl to guide CSicikov to the main road where "Chichikov gave her a copper coin, and she ambled off on her way, contented with merely having sat up on the driver's box." (72.) Sologub surrounds his children with wholesome activ- ity and then takes it away abruptly. Cf. Vladja and his English fishing rod. Sologub frequently posits a psychological observation only to follow it with the construct of a philosophical observation which is not only illogi- cal but also negates the first thought and all seemingly for the purpose of imposing his metaphysical ideology: Only the children, those eternal, tireless [my underlining] vessels of God's delight on the earth, were lively and ran and played. But sluggish- ness [my underlining] was even settling over them by now, and some faceless and invisible monster, nestling at their shoulder, peered from time to time with eyes full of menace into their faces which were sud- denly growing listless [my underlining]. (97) Children remain as children in Gogol"s world, albeit with no developed character, but rather as "part of the painting": I could catch enticing glimpses through the leaf age of the trees, of the red roof and white chimneys of the proprietor's house where there were a half-dozen daughters, with sonorous maidenly laughter, forever playing games, and with the youngest little sister, as always, the greatest beauty of them all ..." (136-137.) And Gogol' allows (Ci-ikov to contemplate the virginal purity of the governor's daughter: ". .. the rounded-out oval of her little face; her waist, ever, ever so slender ... her youthful, graceful small limbs, defining all their pure lines. She seemed to resemble some toy finely and cleanly carved out of ivory .. ." (214.) All fiction must somehow emerge from the non-fiction of the author's consciousness; Peredonov cannot yearn for wholesome beauty as does C~iikov. Nothing is sacred to Peredonov who is obsessed by an urge to 198</page><page sequence="11">destroy. His negative actions always seem to carry an impact which is totally negative: His sensibilities were dull and his consciousness was an apparatus for corruption and destruction. Everything that reached his consciousness was transformed into something vile and filthy. He was immediately taken with deformities in objects and he rejoiced over them. Whenever he passed an erect and pure column, he wanted to deform and deface it. (97.) Gogol"s angle of vision will ascend upward along a column to its very capital: The white, colossal trunk of a birch that had been deprived of its crest by some tempest or thunderstorm rose up out of this green, thick tangle and, high in the air, looked like a round regular column of dazzling marble; the oblique, sharply pointed fracture in which it was terminated in lieu of a capital showed darkly against its snowy whiteness, like a cap or some black-plumed bird. (139.) The whole episode of mutilating cards in The Petty Demon results from Peredonov's paranoia which in its extreme stages causes him to attack. In Dead Souls, Ciwikov plays cards in such a way as to ingratiate himself in the most pleasant way with his adversaries-a kind of win- through-loss operation. Peredonov loses because he's just unlucky: "As was almost always the case he was unlucky and he imagined an expression of ridicule and malice on the faces of the kings, queens and jacks ... Finally, after one enormous loss, Peredonov grabbed the pack of cards and furiously started to tear them to pieces. (191.) Throughout both novels bodily movements or imagery concern- ing the body create atmospheres of movement that seem to issue from each author's archetypal thinking. At the inn in the very first pages of Dead Souls, the servant boy was, "so very lively and spry that it was downright impossible to make out what sort of face he had. He dashed out nimbly, ... tossed back his hair and nimbly led the gentleman up and along the entire wooden outside gallery to show him the chamber that God had provided for him." (4.) Ciaikov is led upward in the very beginning along an outside gallery to be protected by God. In Sologub the movement is down; Bengalsky saves the Geisha by going down a narrow staircase into the courtyard. (263.) At the masquerade, "it was rather filthy in the rooms and right from the beginning a significant portion of the crowd seemed to be drunk. Crooked chandeliers were burning in the cramped rooms with sooty walls and ceilings. The chandeliers seemed enormous, heavy and consumed a great deal of air.. ." (253.) and "The bear [Skoboakina] walked around with heavy steps and roared through the entire hall so that the flames in the chandeliers fluttered." (254.) In Gogol"s inn there is the same sooty ceiling, but the hanging chandelier dingy from smoke, has "a multitude of pendant bits of glass that leapt and bounded and tinkled every time a waiter dashed across the worn-out linoleum, deftly swinging a tray on which was perched as great a host of teacups as you might find birds on a shore..." (6.) 199</page><page sequence="12">In Sologub's town evil intentions generate gossip and the gossip is then discussed "rationally," tying it to the ground. In Gogol"s town the gossip starts from confusion about what is transpiring, accelerates itself with the greatest of verbal ease which, in turn, gives way to the most fanciful of cerebral machinations. There is a kind of electric uneasiness to the anatomies involved in the rapid exchange of gossip in Gogol"s town: "Very well, then, listen to what sort of thing these dead souls are," said the lady who was agreeable in all respects, and her visitor [the lady who was simply agreeable] at these words, became all attention: her little ears perked up of themselves, she sat up very straight, so precariously perched on the divan that one wondered how she retained her seat and, despite the fact that she ran somewhat to embonpoint, suddenly grew slimmer, and as light as swan's down, apt to go sailing through the air at the least puff. (233.) In Sologub's town, Veriga says about Peredonov's fear of rumors being spread about him that the rumors do not dare to rise up from the depths of the town's society where they are cringing in darkness and secrecy. (108.) Gogol' offers psychic relief from nasty words by delivering a panegyric to the Russian word, allowing it to soar into the empyrean. For Gogol', the word is divine. He writes that "there is never a word which can be so sweeping, so boisterous, which would burst out so, from out of the very heart, which would seethe so and quiver and pulse so much like a living thing as an aptly uttered Russian word! (135.) In Petty Demon Darya sings with the following words: "0, deathly melancholy, resound- ing over fields and villages, over the broad expanses of our native land! A melancholy embodied in a frenzied din, a melancholy that devours the living word in a corruptive flame, debasing what was once a living song to an insane wail! 0, deathly melancholy! 0, sweet old Russian song, or are you truly dying? ... (143.) It is important to note that Ci iwkov's first immediate superior was a: Registrar ... who was the personification of indescribably strong insen- sibility and imperturbability, unapproachable ... a man who had never in his life shown a smile on his face, who had not even once greeted anybody with so much as an inquiry about his health ... If he had even once evinced any concern for anything, if he had even once got drunk and in his drunkenness broken into laughter, or he had even once given himself up to wild merrymaking, such as a brigand gives himself up to in a moment of drunkenness! (307.) What is interesting here in Gogol"s listing of the Registrar's sins is that they are all sins of omission created by auctorial supposition predicated on "a man who had never," "a man who had not even" and "if he had even" which actually carry a positive charge in the sense that with them Gogol' tells his reader what the Registrar should have been doing-the "negative" form renders a "positive" relief. Even the laughter and the wild merry- making from drunkenness on the part of the brigand is a psychic relief from the drunken libations to Bacchus on the part of the priests of Themis (176.) to whom Peredonov is related both literally, as a civil teacher, and 200</page><page sequence="13">figuratively as a drinker of large quantities of vodka."7 In Sologub's prose the opposite occurs: statements that seem to be positive carry a charge that is morally negative. Peredonov says that he will tell Vladja's father to beat him-a positive statement with a negative residue. The threat of shaving the cat follows the same pattern. Truth on the side of positive being seems to elude both Peredonov and Sologub. When Peredonov asks Volodin why there is a dirty mirror nearby, Volodin bares his teeth and replies that it's not a mirror but a pond reflecting the trees. (215.) The mirror seems to imply the search for truth or the reflection in this world of Plato's ideals. Sologub injects a curious comment into The Petty Demon to the effect that "Peredonov was striving for the truth after all, according to the general law of every conscious life and he was oppressed by that striving." (228.) If all are striving for the truth, why aren't the Kutilov sisters who lie out of habit so that it's impossible not to believe them? Sologub imposes: "Indeed a falsehood often seems more like the truth than the truth itself. Almost always. Whereas the truth, of course, doesn't seem like the truth." (267.)18 Nor is Sologub's position on Christianity any more clear: "The mystery of the eternal transformation of impotent matter into a force that annulled the bonds of death was forever veiled from him [Peredonov] ... he was possessed of an incongruous combination of nonbelief in the living God and Christ with a belief in sorcery." (201) For Gogol', there is no veil before man's eyes concerning Christian illumination: "But why, then, amid thoughtless, gay, carefree moments, does another, wondrous strain of thought flash of itself within us? The laughter has not yet had time to fade completely ... and yet ... your face has already become illumined with a different light ..." (69.) And further in The Petty Demon there is an equally curious auctor- ial observation on man's relationship to nature which is clearly pagan: Peredonov sensed the reflection of his melancholy and fear in the guise of nature's hostility toward him. But that interior life in nature that defied exterior definition, that life which alone could create genuine relations, profound and manifest, between man and nature-no, he had no sense whatsoever of that kind of life. For that reason, all of nature seemed to him to be replete with petty human emotions [the petty demons]. Blinded by the delusions of the individual and of separate being, he did not comprehend the Dionysian elemental ecstasies that were exultant and rampant in nature. (208.) Sologub's prose here is an awkward echo of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. But how does one reconcile Sologub's thought on Christian trans- formation with his thought on man's pantheistic communion with nature? Sologub says that nature is organic to a wholesome worship of the earth- a wholesomeness which he then corrupts with the ever increasing insanity of Peredonov and whom "biblical murder" has condemned to the hottest fires in hell. (228.) These passages seem to shed a deflected light upon the organic origins of the deep structure of Sologub's The Petty Demon. Sologub's own words about the eternal Christian transformation and the Dionysian elemental ecstasies that seem to elude Peredonov, seem to 201</page><page sequence="14">elude him as well. Gogol' believes that a resolution must come from both man and nature. (140.) Sologub doesn't seem to offer an answer apart from Peredonov's vision which may well be Sologub's very own: In the midst of this languor in the streets and in the houses, in the grip of this alienation from the sky, through this sullied and impotent earth strolled Peredonov, languishing from indistinct fears. And for him there was no solace in the heavenly and no joy in the earthly [my underlining], because even now, as was always the case, he looked at the world through deathly eyes like some kind of demon who was languishing in gloomy solitude out of fear and melancholy. (97.) Sologub sees the future through the mechanical eyes of the dead (110.); Gogol' sees it as the dawning of a Christian utopia. Petty evil in The Petty Demon vested in poshlost' and the gro- tesque does, indeed, seem to be echoed from Dead Souls, but whereas poshlost' and the grotesque are permanent terminals of the totally per- verted world conjured by Sologub, their delineation in Dead Souls is far more subtle-for Gogol' uses them so that he might escape from them into his own lyrical transcendence and so that Cicikov, dipped here and there in the moral slime, but not totally submerged, might finally take the troika ride. In Gogol"s cosmos all things seem to be alive with an endless supply of oxygen and an eternal good will which sublimates the spirit-a sublimation which Sologub gainsays his reader who must continually fall through the holes of his landscape. Dead Souls is a resolution of the divine and the earthly, the divine of which Sologub has banished from The Petty Demon. Sologub must have consciously echoed Gogol"s imagery in Dead Souls, but missing its upward direction, expressed only his own psychic plunge downward, thus failing to create imagery that is organic to Go- gol"s metaphysical being. Instead, Sologub created a metaphysical non- being that is condemned through the workings of demonic agents to a perpetual falling downward. 1014 North Hayworth Ave., #2 West Hollywood, California.

Field's conclusion that Gogol' does not offer an alternative to the "ludicrous components" of his fictional world is in error: Gogol' created the ground plan of Dead Souls (into the madcap characters of which, often grotesque caricatures, he deposited all the nasty, vile traits of his own character; we have this on Gogol"s own words in "Author's Confession") with its frenetic activity where sanity doesn't see the light of day, so that he, Gogol', as narrator-author, might repeatedly soar upward above it in the effusive lyricism of his own sane emotions to create a future utopia for all of 202</page><page sequence="15">mankind. See my article, "Airborne Imagery in Gogol"s Dead Souls," SEEJ, 23, (1979): pp. 173-189. 4. Within the multi-leveled imagery of The Petty Demon, Saga is not the innocent youth presented at first glance: his supple body of ambivalent sexuality and his uncoiling tongue link him to the serpent-god Dionysos ("Sasha laughed with a squeal and stuck out the tip of his tongue rolled up into a tube." (158.) "Sasha turned red, laughed and stuck out the end of his tongue rolled up like a tube." (233.) "It was Sasha's face in both the serpent and the swan bending over Lyudmila .. ." (144.)); his surname "Pyl'nikov" associates him directly with the dust of the town, the whirling dust of the "nedotykomka" and the dust in which he must crawl as the serpent-devil of original sin. For a full argument of this imagery, see G. J. Thurston, "Solo- gub's Melkiy bes," Slavonic and East European Review, 1 (Jan. 1977) and Charlotte Rosenthal and Helene Foley, "Symbolic Patterning in Sologub's Milkii bes," SEEJ, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Spring 1982), 43-55. Nor is Ljudmila the innocent sweetheart of the senior prom. Her entire scheme for the sexual entrapment of Saga together with her impure instincts reveal her as a witch who any minute might vanish in the vapors of her perfumes: rose, lilac, iris, cyclamen, chorilopsis, fuchsia, lily of the valley, clematis and a perfume with a dense herbaceous and brittle scent like the motionless breath of a strangely flowering valley enclosed by mountains. "There was the festive and sweet scent of some new perfume, but something in the scent affected and set (Sasha's) nerves on edge, like the touch of joyful, spritely, rough- skinned little serpents." (170.) For an argument that posits the Rutilov household in particular, and the town, in general, as a coven of hotbed, dense-pack activity, see Linda J. Ivanits, "The Grotesque in Fedor Solo- gub's Novel The Petty Demon," Russian and Slavic Literature (Cambridge, Mass.: Slavica Publishers, 1976), pp. 137-174. Unlike Gogol', furthermore, Sologub has created an earthly reality in which there are sane characters: Marta's brother Vladja is a nice boy with an English fishing rod and we have all met at one time or another the headmas- ter Xripa6 and Saga's landlady, Kokovkina. But unlike the sanity of Gogol"s idealistic vision, Sologub's sane characters make no pronouncements about improving life for the future, but rather, on the contrary, have to deal with Peredonov's paranoia with its overriding sadism and the equally malificent parallel fiction of the amorous, self-indulging misadventure between Saga and Ljudmila. In Sologub's world of inherent evil which is beyond redemp- tion, Peredonov sacrifices Volodin, the sheep without receiving any cathar- sis; Ljudmila and Saga use Peredonov's insanity as their scapegoat in suc- cessfully excusing themselves before the sane characters of Xripaw, Kokov- kina and Saga's newly arrived aunt-but Ljudmila's and Saga's lives still remain an existential deceit and their success calls into question the sanity of the sane. 5. In his book on the imagination as movement L'air et les songes; essai sur l'imagination du mouvement (Paris: Jose Corti, 1943), Gaston Bachelard advances the theory that imagination as movement is synonymous with the dynamic flow of psychic energy issuing from archetypal thinking. Without this psychic dynamism, man does not create in any original sense, but only imitates with pictorial reproduction. In Man and His Symbols (New York: Doubleday, 1972), p. 96, Carl Jung defines this dynamic thrust as the emotion which makes archetypal images meaningful to the human mind: "They [archetypes] are, at the same time both images and emotions. One can speak of an archetype only when these two aspects are simultaneous. When there is merely the image, then there is simply a word-picture of little 203</page><page sequence="16">consequence [an imitative reproduction]. But by being charged with emo- tion, the image gains numinosity [or psychic energy]; it becomes dynamic, and consequences of some kind must flow from it." 6. Victor Erlich, Gogol' (Yale University Press, 1969), p. 118. Erlich takes his lead from Roman Jakobson's "On Realism in Art," (O khudozhestvennom realizme") reprinted in Michigan Slavic Materials (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1952), no. 2, pp. 30-46. 7. A definitive understanding of how well Sologub imitated Gogol' may inev- itably be impossible because of a difference in "atmosphere" around the prose in comparison (the reason for the necessity of full quotes) and because of the lesser or greater skill for writing prose in both authors. Most literary critics will concede that Gogol' is the more subtle writer with a greater stellar magnitude to his imagination. Gogol"'s prose is forever magically smooth in its movement creating drama with an electric dialogue (plugged into life) into which Gogol' hypnotically draws his reader by constantly consulting him with the second-person form of address. Sologub uses the dialogue throughout to create drama, but does not entice the reader into the life of his prose. Sologub's dialogues are too often saccadic to the extent that one scene is instantly truncated by another so that the author can go on to make his next point. 8. See Victor Terras, "Nabokov and Gogol: The Metaphysics of Nonbeing" Poetica Slavica (Ottawa, Canada: University of Ottawa Press, 1981). 9. There can be little doubt that Sologub was enamoured with the details of Gogol''s imagery. The dress of the lady who was simply agreeable was very cheerful, but Praskovia Fedorovna (Sologub's name) thought "that it would be better if the checks were somewhat smaller, and if the polka dots were not brown, but blue." (228.) Peredonov, complaining about his bitch of a landlady and the wallpaper she put up, says that "the entire room is done in a free pattern and small flowers and then over the door are stripes and polka dots. And the color is all wrong." [my underlining] (38.) Sologub's idea for a spying cat may very well have its genesis in the material the lady who was simply agreeable sent to her sister: "it's so bewitching that one simply can't express it in words. Just imagine: teeny-weeny stripes, so-o-o narrow, as narrow as human imagination can picture; the background is blue, and running across the stripe is a design of tiny eyes and tiny paws, tiny and tiny paws, all over... (228.) 10. We know two facts about Peredonov: "I'm a university graduate" (220.) and "Brothers and sisters are always fighting. When I was little, that's how I always played nasty tricks on my sisters. I beat up the young ones and I ruined the clothing of the older ones." (205.) 11. Linda J. Ivanits is correct in her article, "The Grotesque in Fedor Sologub's Novel, The Petty Demon" when she states that "basically he [Peredonov] is drawn from the outside in, through externals which serve both to create pictorial presentation and to reflect the status of his soul." Galina Selegen points out that "unlike other social novels, we do not have a biography of Peredonov, no explanations of social forces forming his character." She notes "there is no plot in the traditional sense, but rather that the novel is a series of the hero's spiritual experiences which reveal his character." But Sologub tells us as much in the novel: "He [Peredonov] was like a corpse activated by external forces and it was as though these forces had no desire to spend much time with him. One of them would play with him for a while and then toss him to another." (229.) Sologub seems to develop his psychological motivation for Pere- 204</page><page sequence="17">donov only with the parceling-out of events to plot the narration; events remain disconnected, tumble on top of each other causing instant lobing off of a scene and seemingly have no other function than to make Peredonov do things that serve as the fulcrum of fear for Sologub's metaphysical ideology. In this respect, Peredonov doesn't need a history-he is the sum of what he still has to perform. 12. Both Gogol' and Sologub use "even though" to introduce metaphors that polish off an argument. C~i.evskij has pointed out Gogol"s use of "even." 13. See Stanley J. Rabinowitz, "Fyodor Sologub's Literary Children: The Spe- cial Case of The Petty Demon" Canadian Slavonic Papers, 21 (1979). 14. This scene of the fluttering handkerchiefs and tiptoes recalls the supreme last farewell of handkerchiefs from Mallarme's "Brise Marine," 1865: Je partirai! Steamer balangant ta mature, L"ve l'ancre pour une exotique nature! Un ennui, desole par les cruels espoirs, Croit encore a l'adieu supreme des mouchoirs! 15. In response to Charlotte Rosenthal and Helene Foley who see the "Lyudmila-Sasha relationship as an alternative to 'peredonovshchina' a world modeled on an idealized pagan Greece, in harmony with nature [my underlining] through which the participants can immerse themselves in creativity, joyfulness, self-oblivion, and a pantheistic communion [my underlining] with the natural flux of the universe that Nietzsche calls Diony- sian," one asks why Sologub applies a "pathetic fallacy" in keeping with Peredonov's mental decline right before Ljudmila and Saga descend into the ravine and not "pathetic fallacy" that complements Ljudmila's and Saga's world that according to Rosenthal and Foley is "brilliant with the passionate colors of flowers, sun, blood and wine?" 16. Once Ci6ikov arrived at the main road, "The wooden time-stained inn received him under its shed, narrow and small but hospitable . . . with fretwork designs, under the roof and around the windows, stood out in sharp, lively and motley contrast against its dark wall; pitchers with flowers were daubed on the shutters." (73.) The description here of the cornices of fresh wood that stand out in sharp, lively and motley contrast against the dark walls illustrates within a few short words Gogol"s use of contrastive language to express his metaphysical posture, i.e. the living and all that represents it will forever stand out in sharp contrast with what is dead and all that represents death. In Pljulkins moribund chamber there is "an ablong yellow engraving of some military engagement or other, with enormous drums, soldiers in cocked hats yelling fit to split their throats .. ." [a fight to live] and "one that took up half a wall by itself, done in oils and depicting flowers, fruits, a cut watermelon .. ." [the freshness of life]. 17. Belinsky characterized Gogol"s art as a pursuit of the ideal in its negation. 18. In Gogol' one must read extremely carefully to catch the truth behind the irony. In Sologub one must read carefully to understand the truth behind the entanglement of falsehoods. 205</page></plain_text>
