From the late eighteenth century came stilted little volumes obviously intended to instruct. In the late nine? teenth-century burgeoning of travelogue series, mentors made gratuitous and unconvincing dis? claimers of aims to teach. If they did admit edu? cational purposes, they confessed to having the lessons "made easy" or, at least, inviting. In the eighteenth century Jedidiah Morse of? fered Geography Made Easy. Being a Short but Comprehensive System of That Very Useful and Agreeable Science.1 An advertisement for the first edition, issued in 1784, was included in the book by the publisher, Meigs, Bowen &amp; Dana of New Haven, and states the author's earnest aims, described in part as follows: The utility of a compendium of geography, which contains a concise, accurate and comprehensive description of the terraqueous globe, is too obvious to need a mention. Mankind are generally fond of acquainting themselves with the world, were it possible for them all to be possessed of the proper means; but geographical books have hitherto been too voluminous and expensive for the purchase, of by far the greater part of the inhabitants of the United States, which has, to them, been an effectual bar to acquaintance with this science. To remedy this, is one important end of this publication. But the Author's more immediate aim is to facilitate the acquisition of geographical knowledge, in the public and private schools throughout the United States. He at first intended it as a manuscript only, for the use of a school under his immediate instruction. . . .

Every one knows, that instructions conveyed in any tolerable kind of verse, are much more easily remembered, than when delivered in the most elegant and harmonious prose. An Epitome, therefore, of Geography (resem? bling a general Map of the World) in which the divisions and sub-divisions of Continents and States?the situation of Cities and Islands?the names and course of Rivers, &amp;c. are pointed out, and described in easy and familiar rhymes? promises satisfaction and profit, not only to the young votaries of Science, but to every one who wishes to read histories, voyages and travels, with advantage and pleasure. To render this small System as useful as may be, great care has been taken, to express every idea with perspicuity, and at the same time with the utmost brevity. . . .

The great burst of travelogue publishing in the next century provided such subtitles as "a peep at/7 "rambles among," "a geographical present" and such lighthearted qualifiers as "knockabout" and "zigzag," to suggest carefree journeys. The first of a considerable band of guardians who served as guides for the young was the Briton Isaac Taylor, father of the famous Jane and Ann who wrote Original Poems for Infant Minds (1804). To his Scenes in Europe (1818), Scenes in Asia (1819), Scenes in Africa (1820), Scenes in America (1821), and Scenes in England (1822), published first in London by Harris and Son, he appended the euphemistic subtitle "for the Amusement and Instruction of Little Tarry-at Home Travellers/' American editions of these little books had various publishers and dates from 1822 on. And there followed Scenes in Foreign Lands; or, A view of Some of the Most Remarkable Wonders of Travel, an Interesting and Instructive Book for Young People (Phila? delphia: W. A. Leary, 1843?). Following Isaac Taylor by several decades, Samuel Griswold Goodrich?known by his pseu 230 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</page><page sequence="4">From a chapter on education in the colonies in The Boy Travellers in Australasia. donym, Peter Parley?and Jacob Abbott opened the floodgates of travelogue publishing with lengthy series, including the latter's famous little "Rollo" books. A cue to Abbott's temperament and character and engaging the reader's atten? tion at once in Rollo in Naples is Uncle George's list of nine rules for two parties traveling to? gether. The first of these reads: The interior of the carriage, all the way, shall belong to Mrs. Gray and her family, and the coupe to Mr. George and Rollo. Mr. George or Rollo may, perhaps, sometimes ride inside; but if they do so, it is to be understood that they ride there as the guests of Mrs. Gray; and in the same manner, if at any time any of Mrs. Gray's party ride outside, it will be as the guests of Mr. George and Rollo. This was followed by rules for choosing rooms upon arriving at the hotel and for setting the hour for the next day's departure. The fourth rule states: Any person who is not ready to sit down to breakfast at the time which shall have been appointed by Mrs. Gray the evening before, or FALL 1981 231</page><page sequence="5">From Jacob Abbott's Rollo in Geneva (Chicago: W. B. Conkey Co., 1900). who shall not be ready to enter the carriage at the time appointed, shall pay a fine, except in the case hereinafter provided for. If the person so behindhand is one of the children, the fine shall be two cents, or the value thereof in the currency of the country where we may chance to be; and if it is one of the grown persons, the fine shall be three times that amount, that is, six cents. Another cause for fines is elucidated in rule eight. Any one of the party who shall at any time make complaint of any thing in respect to the carriage, or the riding during the day, or in respect to the food provided at the hotels, or the rooms, or the beds, when we stop for the night, except when such complaint relates to an evil which may be remedied, and is made with a view to having it remedied, shall be fined one cent, or the value thereof in the currency of the country. Rosie is to be the sole judge of the infractions of the rule, and is to impose the fine, while Josie as before is to collect and keep the money. The final rule provides that "On the arrival of the party at Naples, the amount of the fine money shall be expended in the famous Neapoli? tan confectionery, and shall be divided equally among the three children/7 Goodrich and Abbott were succeeded in turn by other New Englanders, the more literary and less prolific Horace E. Scudder (editor of River? side Magazine)?a writer whom the Atlantic called "the more serene and non-sensational story-teller for children"?with his storybooks about the doings of the Bodley family on their jaunts abroad and Edward Everett Hale and Susan Hale with their "Family Flight" series, which extended to such distant "flights" as A Family Flight over Egypt and Syria. I found it agreeable in 1949 to accept as a topic for my contribution to the Caroline M. Hewins honor lecture series (founded by that generous bibliophile Frederic G. Melcher, then president of the R. R. Bowker Company and donor of the Newbery and Caldecott Medals for outstanding works of American children's literature) Frederic Melcher's suggestion: "The Travelogue Storybook of the Nineteenth Cen? tury." He told me that as a boy in the late 1880s he had read and loved the travelogues being pub 232 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</page><page sequence="6">lished then in great numbers for young readers. In his introduction to my lecture (published as a monograph by Horn Book, Inc.) he called the genre "a fascinating but almost forgotten field/' I found surprising interest in these made-to order, pedestrian storybooks as I began to con? sider their emergence out of social developments of their day. First of all, a taste for adventure was sending explorers on expeditions into en? ticingly remote and hitherto uninvestigated areas of the world. Zealous troupes of missionaries, merchants, tourists, and reporters then followed them. This was occurring within a period of in? creasing vigor in the creation of an American literature for children, and it was natural for storybook writers also to look afar. The more remote or exotic the lands traveled From Pacific Shores; or Adventures in Eastern Seas (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1898), by William Taylor Adams writing under the name Oliver Optic.

Charles A. Stephens sent his Young Yachters to Iceland for a look at gey? sers and his Knockabout Club to the tropics to see strange flora and fauna. Late in the century William Taylor Adams, who wrote under the pseudonym Oliver Optic, dispatched his Boat Club, his Young Navigators, and characters from Our Young Folks Abroad series and his All Over-the-World Library to Eastern Seas and "Across India" as well as "Down the Rhine." His publishers promoted these books?"a blend of the amusing and instructive," declared a re? viewer in 1881?as being "very numerous stor? ies" but "uniformly excellent in morals and literary quality." In these end-of-the-century years, Stephens and Adams had contemporaries in the more ac? complished writers Hezekiah Butterworth and Thomas W. Knox. Knox's lavishly illustrated quarto volumes were praised in the Literary World of November 23, 1889, as "the most at? tractive and popular form in which books for children are now made. The style is a cross be? tween the picture-book and the story-book and the story has a strong infusion of recent real life in the shape of travel or history." Numerous wood engravings lent elegance to many of the volumes, which were often intended for gift-giving. Isaac Taylor is said to have sup? plied for his works as many as 192 engravings, made chiefly from his own designs. Sixty-five were publicized as adorning W. H. G. Kingston's single volume, In the Wilds of Africa, a Tale for Boys, of which an early edition appeared in 1883. In 1889 Knox supplied 250 engravings and orig? inal sketches for his The Boy Travellers in Aus? tralasia (New York, Harper &amp; Brothers) and provided nearly as many for a volume on the Orient and Middle East. The formal engravings used by Knox and Butterworth and others were obtained by the common practice of delving into publishers' stocks of cuts?which led, of course, to repeated appearances of classic scenes of art and architecture. One reviewer in the late nine? teenth century even suggested that some texts were probably "arranged to fit the illustrations." Titles and subtitles were devised to suggest glamour and excitement. Hezekiah Butterworth aimed to enhance the lure of his book on the From Thomas W. Knox's The Boy Travellers in Central Europe (1893). FALL 1981 ^35</page><page sequence="9">From Thomas W.

He gave to his Boy Travellers volume on the Orient and Middle East the rousing title Backsheesh! In his volume on Australasia he projects his lively manner as he describes the mishaps of a kangaroo drive: We let loose the dogs, which up to this time had been kept behind us, and they went away without any urging. The dogs are kept for this purpose, just as fox-hounds are kept in England and France, or deer-hounds in Scotland. The dogs soon overtook and pulled down a young kanga? roo; this caused some delay, but not much, and they were speedily put on the track of an 'old man' kangaroo, as a full-grown male is called. Knox's The Boy Travellers in Central Europe (1893) has one of the boys describe a glacier: "A glacier," says Fred, "is a mass of ice that flows like a river, with the difference that where a river flows one, two, or more miles an hour, the glacier only moves a few inches in a day, perhaps only an inch or two, and in winter hardly any perceptible distance. It is formed of the granular snow that falls in the highest Alpine regions above the snow line (eight or nine thousand feet), and accumulates in the valleys and in the clefts of the rocks." The travels of Elizabeth Champney's young Vassar Girls were less far-flung. Although, primed by high spirits and energy, the girls boldly ventured beyond the Mediterranean Sea to the Holy Land, most of their travel was con? fined to Europe. The Three Vassar Girls in France (Boston: Estes and Lauriat, 1888) shows the girls reacting in shock to the fact that cats and dogs were being sold for food: One shuddering glance was enough, though the market-women protested that they were patron? ized by the aristocracy, and that cat had risen, a large one costing now twenty francs (four dollars). Dogs were cheaper; and Melicent was so much touched by the piteous aspect of a Russian Skye who was offered for sale alive, and seemed to understand for what fate he was reserved, that she incontinently purchased him.

From Three Vassar Girls in France. the Rhine (1887) demonstrate a characteristically provincial point of view: We decided to make the trip from Heidelberg to Strasburg by the railroad which runs through the northern portion of the Schwarzwald, or Black Forest. The villages which we see from the car-windows are very picturesque; the houses having timbered fronts, and queer galleries and balconies. Our first stop was at Carlsruhe, a sufficiently stupid town, named from the fact that the Mar? grave Charles of Baden-Durlach built a hunting lodge here when all around was wilderness and forest. Baden we found more interesting. It is the most fashionable watering-place of Germany, and is sometimes called Baden Baden, to imply that here are the Baden, or Baths, par excellence, and to distinguish it from other Badens. It is said that at the height of the season there are not unfrequently fifty thousand strangers in the place. The estimate sounds preposterous, but it is probably correct. We visited the Conversations haus the evening of our arrival, and the next morning explored the dungeons under the Castle. These are very extensive, and were possibly the judgment-hall, dungeons, and chambers of torture of some secret tribunal. We were shown a rusty thumb-screw, and dropped some pebbles into an oubliette into which poor wretches were thrown. We heard the pebbles bound and rebound for nearly a quarter of a minute, and the faint splash which told that there was water at the bottom. We were glad to escape from this ghastly 238 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</page><page sequence="12">A village in the Black Forest from Elizabeth W.

Much later, in the 1950s, a set of writings similarly intended to inform and also to enter? tain appeared?surprisingly, we might add? under the editorship of the distinguished New York City librarian Frances Clarke Sayers, who gave her name and attention to a series focused on a troupe of neo-Young Travelers. Her fiction? alized accounts differed, however, from the long earlier series produced by one commissioned author. She commissioned a knowledgeable spe? cialist individually for each volume. The coun? tries covered were not only those well known to children from their schoolwork?France, Hol? land, Germany, and Italy, in particular?but South American lands and the West Indies, Japan, New Zealand, Czechoslovakia, and Rus? sia. Although this series did not have a long life, its books were well received in their day. Accord? ing to one reviewer, the set made "great supple? mentary reading, but needs the balance of a collection containing straight factual materials."2 The short life span of the travelogues is proof of the transitory nature of such writing. Criteria for style and content in books for young readers changed. Critics and book selectors came to agree that nonfiction about countries should stand without fictionalizing, just as they were to frown on anthropomorphism in books purporting to inform about animal life. Modern publications with well-designed and uncluttered title pages dropped expansive subtitles like those spelled out by Knox in his books about the Boy Travel? lers. Fulsome minutiae in description also suc? cumbed to the criterion of succinctness. The im? portance of documenting facts was recognized. A look at twentieth-century books about for? eign countries reveals contributions from such notable authorities as Sigrid Undset on Norway and Harrison E. Salisbury on Russia. With greater emphasis given to design and illustration, first-rank artists were engaged, such as the Gua? temalan painter Carlos Merida, who contributed to Patricia F. Ross's Made in Mexico (New York: Knopf, 1952). Other distinctively illustrated vol? umes in the same series covered China, Japan, Thailand, India, Iceland, and West Africa. The fictionalized My Village in . . . series focused chiefly on European countries and provided out? standing illustrative photographs. 240 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</page><page sequence="14">Today writers of fiction from countries around the world are presenting fresh backgrounds to American children. A cluster of Australian lumi? naries?Patricia Wrightson, Ivan Southall, Joan Phipson, Eleanor Spence, and Colin Thiele? have emerged to claim favorable critical atten? tion. Titles in both nonfiction and fiction for a wide range of reading ages have become avail? able particularly about countries well known to children from school study or through classic literary characters. About the Netherlands, be? loved for Mary Mapes Dodge's brave Hans Brinker and Lucy Fitch Perkins's Dutch twins, there are today in print in this country twenty works of fiction, eight of general nonfiction, and three of history, while France, known for Puss in Boots and Cinderella, is represented by forty seven works of fiction, twenty-four of general nonfiction, and nine of history. It should be noted in conclusion that the close rapport in America between the publishers and selectors of children's books has allowed a con? tinued production here of books originating abroad. Republication or translation has resulted in part from the interest shown by children's librarians and other consumers, the mediators between publishers and children. International conferences have created awareness of the kinds of books available. Rights to translate or repub lish are bought by publishers attending the an? nual children's book fair in Bologna, established in 1966 and attended by children's book editors from an ever increasing number of countries. In part also exchange of books across national boundaries is accomplished through the bestow? ing of awards. The Mildred L. Batchelder Award, sponsored by the American Library Association, is given annually to an American publisher of an outstanding work originally published in a for? eign language in a foreign country. And the bi? ennial international Hans Christian Andersen Medals are granted by the International Board on Books for Young People for an author's and an artist's total oeuvre. Published concurrently with the Andersen Medals is an honors list of one title per country for authorship and one for illustration. Outstanding translators are also singled out for honor. Geography today addresses itself to more than land and water?or maps, winds, tides, and clouds?and books for children "fond of ac? quainting themselves with the world" are many and varied. There should be something that "promises satisfaction ... to the young votaries of Science . . . [and] to every one who wishes to read histories, voyages and travel, with advan? tage and pleasure." Virginia Haviland served as chief of the Children's Literature Center at the Library of Congress from its beginnings in 1963 to 1981. Responsible for such works as Children s Literature: A Guide to Refer? ence Sources (with three supplements) and The Best of Children's Books, 1964-1978, she also organized annual children's book lectures at the Library which were recently compiled in The Openhearted Audi? ence: Ten Authors Talk about Writing for Children. She began her library career in 1934 at the Boston Public Library, where she became reader's adviser for children in 1952, serving in that capacity until 1963. A lecturer on children's literature and a re? viewer of children's books, she has also served on significant committees making awards to children's books nationally and internationally, including the Hans Christian Andersen international children's book award, the Newbery-Caldecott Award, the New York Herald Tribune awards, and the National Book Awards for children's books. She received both the Regina Medal and Grolier Award in 1976. Virginia Haviland is a member of the National Society of Women Geographers and wrote her first book on The Travelogue Storybook of the Nineteenth Century (1950). Beginning with Favorite Fairy Tales Told in England, she prepared collections of fairy tales told in Germany, France, Russia, Norway, Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Swe? den, Japan, Greece, Denmark, and India. In 1972 she compiled A Fairy Tale Treasury. Other books that combine an interest in geography with an inter? est in children's literature are The Wide World of Children's Books and Children's Books of Interna? tional Interest. After attending the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions meeting in 1980 she traveled to China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Thailand, returning with new ideas about the creation of children's literature in those lands.
