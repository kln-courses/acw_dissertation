MONEY-COUTTS them, a great depth of soil has collected to form a flat plain, which is now one of the most fertile parts of Crete, especially since the introduction of the potato some forty years ago.' The plain is roughly oval in shape, about seven miles from east to west by about four miles from north to south (Fig. 2). It is divided into two unequal parts by the large knoll called Kephala, which rises not far from the east end and separates the flat plain to the west from the more broken country to the east. The western portion is divided into squares some 600oo yards each way by dykes. These are known as AivilcS, and are attributed by the inhabitants to the Venetians. But in Venetian times the plain was 'out of bounds' on pain of mutilation, owing to the risk of re- bellions being hatched in this out-of-the-way spot,2 and the regularity of the ivicats seems more in keeping with an origin in Roman times. To the south rise the massive twin summits of Dikte proper, Aphendes Khristos and Spathi, both of them just over 7Ioo feet high, and reached in about 2j hours from the plain. East of these is the slightly lower summit of Mount Lazaros, which overhangs the south side of the smaller plain of Katharos, Iooo feet above Lasithi proper. The south-east corner of Katharos is blocked by Mount Khalasmenos. Next comes Mount Aloidha, bounding Lasithi to the east. On the north side is the low ridge of Xerakias or Psarokorphe, behind which rises Mount Selena (c. 5300 feet). Farther west is the peak of Karphi, with the great shoulder of Koprana running down from it, then the ridge of Agiou Georgiou Papoura, and in the north- west corner Mount Louloudhaki. At the north end of the west side is Mount Bergadhi; next comes Mount Aphendes, rising to about the same height as Selena, and south of this Mount Sarakinos, with spurs called Phasossalo, Phaskomiliais and Plaka running down to the plain. There are three smaller plains at a higher level: (I) Katharos, already mentioned, which has cultivation and grazing and is sparsely inhabited all the year round in spite of its altitude; 3 (2) Limnarkaros, uninhabited but well watered and cultivated, between Spathi Diktes and Plaka; (3) Nesimos, a small plain cultivated with difficulty, between Selena and Karphi. Lasithi is drained by the Megalos Potamos, which descends by the 1 Hogarth's theory (BSA VI II5) that the plain was a lake until MM I times, with the Diktaian Cave as a swallow hole, is disproved by the occurrence of Neolithic pottery at Trapeza, which lies at a lower level than that cave. The only site on a level with the flat plain, the Roman site at Vounos, preserves in its name a memory of the time when it was a settlement on top of a small eminence rising out of the marsh. By pure chance the level of the soil has risen just to the top of it. How many other sites are now com- pletely buried leaving no indications on the surface onecannot say. But the local inhabitants speak of bones found at a great depth when wells are dug. 2 BSA XX p. I2. 3 For the Palaeozoic remains cf.

MONEY-COUTTS Khavgas or Khaos gorge from Katharos, receives a considerable tributary which comes down the Poros ravine from Limnarkaros, and eventually disappears into a Xc'voS or swallow hole on the north side of Mount Bergadhi, near Kato Metokhi. Corn and potatoes are grown at the west end of the plain, olives on the broken ground to the east and vines on the lower slopes of the surround- ing hills. Almond, apple and mulberry trees are not uncommon, but efforts at reafforestation have been confined to planting a quantity of ilex trees on the north side of the plain. Grazing on the mountains is good, and the quality of the misithra is said to rival that of Ida. The villages are numerous: (I) Tzermiadho or Tzermiadha, the capital, below Selena; (2) Lagou a quarter of an hour west; (3) Pinakiano, five minutes west of that, with the nearly deserted monastery of Vidhiani near by; (4) Pharsaro, a quarter of an hour east of Tzermiadha; (5) Marmaketo, practically joining the last; (6) Mesa Lasithi, twenty minutes to the east with (7) Zmaliano Metokhi adjoining it, and (8) Mikro Lasithaki, all lie on the north side of the plain. To the west are: (9) Kato Metokhi, (io) Gerontomouri (also known rudely as Gaidhouromandri), ( 11) Plate and (12) Psykhro. On the south side are: (13) Magoulas, now practically deserted, (14) Kaminaki, (I5) Agios Georgios, and a group which practically amount to suburbs of it, (16) Koudhoumalia, (I7) Avrakontas and (I8) Plathiano. On the east side of the Kephala is (19) Agios Konstantinos and, close by, the monastery of Panagia Kroustallenia. In the middle of the plain is the conspicuous church of Agios Ioannes Prodhromos. The total population is about 7000. Though surrounded by mountains, the plain is not difficult of access. It is not, however, on the direct route between any of the great centres. This accounts for the fact that its culture has throughout shewn a pro- nounced individuality of character, and has yet kept in touch with the out- side world. Most of the mountains are scaleable at almost any point, but the following are regular routes passable for pack animals. I. To Kato Metokhi from Lyttos by the 'Tomb of Tsouli.'

I. 13 East of this there is said to be another on the saddle of MTraTr&amp;Kl. No doubt other sites will be found in this district as well as fresh evidence as to those already known. As we have said above, there may well have been settlements which have been covered deeply by the soil of the plain. II. THE CAVE OF TRAPEZA. A. Position and Previous Explorations (Plate 6, Fig. 3). The low plateau called Trapeza lies to the N.E. of the village of Tzermiadha, the summit rising about 300 feet above the level of the plain. Near the east end of the steep southern face of this plateau is a cave, usually known simply as Tris Tpa-i3cas r6 orriiweato, but known also as Trfis VRKaS fl Fpii2rl, to distinguish it from two or three others in the same region, 0o0pvos, a small cave with no antiquities in it, which lies slightly farther west, -ro rpupvdvrl -r6 or raiato, a mere crack in the rock some 30 metres east of Trapeza, which contained a neolithic vase excavated in I937, and nrlyaiadnKc , a larger cave on the north side of the plateau near three small wells, which is also barren of ancient remains. Our cave, which will be called henceforth simply " Trapeza," was first discovered by Sir Arthur Evans (Academy 20.6.96), who refers to it as containing objects mainly of the Hellenistic period, but also comprising a faience figurine of Bes and fragments of gold leaf which subsequently found a parallel in the Early Minoan jewellery at Mokhlos. Taramelli (Mon. Ant. IX 410) also mentions the cave. Bosanquet (unpublished notes) states that a few pieces of bronze reminiscent of the material from the cave on Mount Ida were found here. Otherwise it does not seem to have been visited by archaeologists until June I935, when Miss Money-Coutts and Messrs. R. W. Hutchinson and J. D. S. Pendlebury explored it. Early Minoan II sherds, including a few fragments of Vasilike ware, were found, and with the help of a grant from the Craven Fund of Cambridge University the excavation began on 4 May, 1936, lasting until 19 May. Miss Money-Coutts and Mr. and Mrs. Pendlebury were present throughout, Mr. A. Mayor assisted for the first week, and Mr. R. S. Lavers, architect of the Egypt Exploration Society at Tellel-Amarna, stayed long enough to make the plans and sections. With the consent of the Committee of the British School at Athens, the Curator at Knossos kindly lent the invaluable services of Emmanueles Akoumianos, the School's foreman, for the first week, after which he was replaced by Ioannes Meliarakes of Psykhro, thanks to the courtesy of Dr. S. Marinatos, Ephor of Crete and Director of the Candia Museum, whose foreman he is.</page><page sequence="10">14 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS On our return to Candia every facility was put at our disposal in spite of the necessarily overcrowded state of the Museum, due to its rebuilding, and the Museum formatore immediately began work on mending and restor- ing the vases. We wish here to express our gratitude to the Director and also to Professor Kumaris of the Anthropological Museum at the University of Athens, who undertook to study the bones found during the excavations; to Mr. R. J. H. Jenkins, of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, who translated Professor Kumaris' report, and to Dr. W. L. H. Duckworth, ofJesus College, Cambridge, who made a technical revision of the report with additional notes. Our thanks are also due to Mr. J. R. le B. Tomlin and Mr. H. H. Brindley for the identification of the shells found in the cave. We are indebted to Dr. A. B. Cook and Professor A. J. B. Wace for their interest and help. B. The Excavation (Figs. 3-5). The cave is entered by a low doorway and descends sharply for some seven metres. At this point a broad, flat " landing " occurs, and it turns westwards, to descend sharply again until another level area is found near the back. The rock is extremely porous, and as a result stalactites have formed, a thin glaze often covering the surface of the finds. Holes in the rock allow free passage for currents of air, and even with seven or eight workmen and a petrol lamp the atmosphere never became too stuffy. This also accounts for the quantity of soil in the cave, which could not have been washed in from without, since the entrance is at the top of a steep slope of rock. Although no cave which had hitherto been excavated had shewn any sign of stratification, every precaution was taken that no levels were missed. The plan and section (Figs. 3 and 4) shew how the cave was dug. Horizontally the natural divisions were separately excavated; the narrowing of the cave at the end of the 6th metre, the sharp change in direction at the I Ith, the fallen mass of stalactite at the i5th, the narrowing at the i9th and the 22nd metres provided good stopping-places. After the re- moval of a sufficient amount of disturbed soil from the surface, the lower strata were carefully excavated-horizontally a metre at a time, vertically by as much as would conveniently overlap its neighbouring layer. As each portion was completed the next vertical section of unexcavated deposit was carefully inspected for any signs of artificial levels or changes of earth. Not even the smallest fragment of earth was removed except under the eye of a member of the staff, and after a preliminary inspection in the cave the soil was carefully sieved, again under English eyes, on the small plateau outside, each basket of earth being labelled before it was brought up to daylight. Unfortunately the cave had been the happy hunting-ground for genera-</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI.

Even since our excavation to bedrock, the tradition persists of a great treasure (Aoydpt), haunted and guarded by three niggers ('Ap&amp;rrbES) 'ANvE TcAS O rrPXEI orTb P3&amp;Oos lia youpoiva I AqT-r( youpouvdKla drrO Xpuaocp'--daA rroioSo KaTrXEt TrOo V&amp; EIVE; '1 So touching a faith cannot be - NORTH SECTION IN A I SOUTH -- FLOOR OF CAVE.

Fortunately, however, this rigorous method was pursued in spite of all early disappointments for one pure, unmixed stratum was found 1 'They say there is in the depths of the cave a sow with seven piglets all of gold- but who knows where they are?' This legend of golden sow and piglets guarded by niggers is common to practically every ancient site in Crete and, I believe, in Mainland Greece and the Islands. The probable value of the treasure can be calculated from the number of piglets and of ghostly guardian niggers, which in my experience vary from seven to two and from three to one respectively.

This had evidently been overlooked by previous excavators, owing to the fact that it contained only sherds and bones, and very few of those-more- over the soil was almost indistinguishable from virgin soil. How mixed were the other strata is shewn by the lid (405), which consists of no less than twelve pieces, which came from the following levels: A 5. 0"20-o040, 15. 0o40-0o70, 16. Hole. 0o.30-0o.60, 17. IIo-I40 N. side, 20-22. 0-0o30. On the whole, however, fragments seem to have kept more or less in the same natural divisions of the cave mentioned above. It is vertically that the mixing is complete. This thorough disturbance also precluded the possibility of finding out anything concerning the burial customs. It is possible that the fact that skulls were found embedded in stalactite at the side of the cave implies that the bodies were shovelled aside to make room for newcomers, and their presence above the floor-level shews that they were sometimes laid on shelves of rock. Except, therefore, for this one pure stratum, our attribution of clay and stone vases, seals and metal objects to a particular period is on stylistic grounds alone, and we wish to warn others that our dating is purely pro- visional and must be used with the greatest caution. We have given our reasons in copious footnotes, but we are quite prepared to have our dating for any particular object upset. C. Summary of the Results. A. Terrace below the cave.

Briefly, then, the history of Trapeza may be summarised as follows. At the end of the Late Neolithic period and during most of the Sub- Neolithic-EM I period it was a place of habitation, like many other caves.1 This is practically proved by the fact that the undisturbed stratum contained no human, but only animal bones as well as cooking pots. By the EM II period the custom of communal interment had come in and, as often happens in primitive times, the dwelling of a previous age was adopted or imitated for a tomb. Burials certainly continued here until the end of EM III. The MM I pithoi found in the cave may point to the survival of the custom of interment there into that period. An alterna- tive suggestion would be that the MM I remains are in the nature of offerings, just as it seems that in the Messara at this time the circular built tombs were no longer used as burial-places, but still received votive- gifts, some of them, as Agia Triadha, actually having special annexes erected. Before the end of MM I, but not before a few fragments of the highly localised MM II style had been imported from Knossos or Phaistos and an early XIIth Dynasty scarab from Egypt, the cave was abandoned, and its place was taken by the Diktaian Cave on the opposite side of the plain at Psykhro, where the earliest objects date from the very end of MM I (i.e., just before the beginning of MM III). Remains of a later date at Trapeza are negligible. 1 E.g. Amnisos pac-TnKc 1929 p. 95; Kamarais BSA XIX p. 12 ; Magasa ibid. XI p. 260; Miamou, Mont. Ant.

PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS Note.-Since in the section on Pottery some confusion may easily arise as to the overlapping of periods in various parts of the island, it is advisable to give a short table showing how in our opinion the series goes in the Centre, South and East of Crete.

It should be noted that the positive dates are taken from the hitherto accepted Egyptian chronology, which makes the EM period almost impossibly long. Fortunately, however, there are signs that the date of the Ist Dynasty may soon be brought down to about 300ooo B.c. and the later dates lowered accordingly until the XIIth Dynasty, the beginning of which is astronomically fixed to 2000 B.C.1 Lasithi as a whole from EM II onwards would seem to belong chrono- logically, though not altogether culturally, to the East. 1 Scharff Journal of Egyptian Archaeology XIV p. 275.

The pottery of the Trapeza Cave was unstratified except in one instance -namely, the Trapeza ware strata A 17. I'IO-I'40 S. and 16-18. I'40- I'70 S. For this reason it has had to be dated entirely stylistically, and in Crete this is not easy, owing to the overlapping of periods in different parts of the island, and to the rarity of properly stratified sites. More- over, the number of whole vessels found was small compared with the total number of sherds, and many of the latter have had to be included in the detailed descriptions which follow, in order to avoid giving a wrong impression of the general material, even when their reconstruction is open to doubt. It has been found convenient, except in the cases of the Neolithic and Trapeza wares, which have been treated separately, to divide the finds arbitrarily according to their shapes, and to arrange each class more or less in chronological order, since it is easier to say whether, for instance, one cup is earlier than another than whether either is contemporary with a jug. A date has been given for every piece, but these are to be accepted with reserve. It must also be remembered that the shapes really merge into one another, and that the distinction between cups, bowls and dishes is often a matter of opinion; but this method seems to present fewer diffi- culties than any other, and to be the first step towards achieving a real corpus of Minoan pottery. In the introduction to each class an attempt has been made to give parallels from other sites and to assign the Trapeza vessels to their proper periods. Drawings and sections have been given wherever possible. Vessels now restored in the Candia Museum have been treated as whole specimens except in the sections, but in those cases where the restoration is merely on paper, the existing sherds have been sketched in. Everything is hand-made unless the contrary is expressly stated. The pottery is almost entirely Minoan, although two or three sherds seem to be Greek, and some medieval and modern fragments occurred on the surface and immediately outside the cave. The bulk of it belongs to the EM II and III periods, but there is also a fair proportion which must be ascribed to MM I. Specimens later than this are rare, and seem to have found their way to the cave after it had fallen into general disuse. The Neolithic wares resemble those of East Crete, but at the very end of the Neolithic Period and in Sub-Neolithic times there was an en- tirely local development, and this perhaps explains the scarcity of EM I finds, for the makers of Trapeza ware were probably in part contem- porary with the EM I population of the coastal districts. Again in EM II and III the influence of the Eastern centres is obvious, but</page><page sequence="22">26 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS when the balance of power was shifting towards the centre of the island, and when MM Ia pottery appeared at Knossos, Mallia and Tylissos, Lasithi, like the rest of Crete, seems to have persisted along its ancient lines, preserving the connection with the declining East. The influence of the rising North is, however, shewn by the MM I pottery at Trapeza, and the tendency was to import and imitate Knossian fabrics, though it must be remembered that MM I at Trapeza, as at other Eastern and Southern sites in Crete, corresponds in date with the MM Ib and the MM II of the capital. Thus the pottery from a rather isolated region, although possessing markedly local features, better reflects the general history of Crete than does that from many more important sites whose history was less peaceful. Neolithic. N. (Plate 7, Fig. 6.) Many fragments of Neolithic pottery were found, mostly in the lower levels. The clay varies from brown to black, and is rather coarse. The surface is burnished, but never so brilliantly as in the best Neolithic fabrics of Knossos. Sometimes there is an incised decoration consisting of a series of dashes (N. 1-3) or parallel rows of dots (N. 4). The incision does not appear to have been filled with white,1 but the sherds are generally too much worn for this to be certain. The shapes represented are mainly open bowls and dishes, but it was impossible to restore any complete pots. The handles are of the usual tubular Neolithic type (N. 5-7) with the ex- ception of N. 8, which, with its triangular section, is most peculiar. A similar handle in Trapeza ware was afterwards found on the Kastellos, but from other sites the only ones which bear the least resemblance to it are from the Neolithic levels at Phaistos,2 and these are not identical. One sherd (N. 9) is of particular interest, since it seems possible that it represents part of a face of the type found in Trapeza ware (T. I I-I3). It is un- fortunately much damaged, but it certainly bears an impression closely resembling an eye. This Neolithic pottery is in general similar to that found at Magasa,3 and should be contemporary with the Late Neolithic of Knossos. On account of their poor condition no sections are given of the Neolithic sherds. N. I (P1. 7).-Sherd, broken all round, of brownish clay with low burnish.

There is a knob possibly representing a nose, at one side and near this an indentation resembling an eye. It is possible that the knob was merely coming out to an ordinary tubular handle. Trapeza Ware. T. (Plates 7 and 8. Figs. 6 and 7.) The type of pottery to which, for the sake of distinction, the name of Trapeza ware has been given occurred at all levels, but always in greatly increased proportion below o'80. In the stratum A 17. I*Io-I "4O S. it was found unmixed, except for one sherd, probably from a suspension pot, of the grey powdery clay described below (see Io9-19), and another of coarse dark fabric with two parallel lines on it in chalky white paint, both of which may belong to EM I.J1 Below 1 40 it was the only ware represented in A 16-18 S., but only a few fragments of it were recovered at this depth, since virgin soil began at about I 50. The Trapeza ware sherds from these strata mentioned in the detailed description which follows are marked with an asterisk; the rest were of the usual types, but too fragmentary to be catalogued. In other parts of the cave the ware was associated with the Neolithic pottery described above (N.), as it was also on the Kastellos and in the Skaphidhia Cave, and it seems more than anything else to resemble the coarser unpolished Late Neolithic fabrics of Knossos, Phaistos and the Miamou Cave.2 The clay is always gritty and badly baked. On the break it varies in colour from reddish-brown to black. The surface is without slip, and only very occasionally polished (T. 2-4), although it often shews shallow scorings, as though from wiping while wet (T. 17-19), a feature also observable on Late and Sub-Neolithic sherds from Knossos. The characteristic colour is a mottled combination of purplish-red and black in small patches. 1 The use of white paint during this period is vouched for by Mackenzie, JHS XXIII p. i65; cf. also P of M I p. 63; BSA X p. 20o1, Fig. 3 a; BSA Supp. I p. 4, Fig. I. 2 P of M II p. 9.

I. 29 This is quite unlike the mottling of Vasilike wares,' and does not seem to have been produced by firing, but to be due to some agent in the clay itself.2 In a few cases the outside is yellowish-brown and the interior entirely black (T. 7), and on such fragments the two surfaces have frequently 11 TsI TILTIt tflLIl TZlI&amp;T23 1FTT 1 Tlq TI T2 13 14 rr] T 20 T Ti ?$ T25 T26 "t 8 TiS T23 T21 124 T26 Ts T 22z T 21 FIG. 7.-TRAPEZA WARE, SECTIONS AND RESTORED POTS.

Gournia p. 50. 2 This clay seems to be the same as that used for various later vessels, in particular the cups (5o1-12, 524) the dishes (301-15) and the pithoi (92o-22), but when it is properly baked the mottling does not shew. It is presumably local. A few pithoi are still made in Lasithi at Pinakiano, the clay coming from Agios Georgios or Kato Metokhi.</page><page sequence="26">30 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS which is unmistakable, no matter what the variations in colour. Un- fortunately it is extremely friable, and it was found impossible completely to restore any one pot. No flat sherds occur, and it is therefore to be presumed that all bases were round or egg-shaped. Several such could, in fact, be pieced together (T. 18, 20, 23). They are usually rather thicker than the side walls, but the double thickening of T. 20 is unique. The rims are either upright or slightly outsplayed. They are generally plain, but T. 8 is thickened to a band, and from the Kastellos there later came an example with parallel cuts along the top, a method of decoration found again in MM III, and which seems to have persisted in Lasithi almost to the present day. One type of jar (T. 9) seems to have been 'two-storied' with a collar neck some 8-Io cms. high and a groove where this joined the bulging shoulder.1 The diameter of all vessels must have been large, varying from about 20 to 40 cms. Probable shapes are restored in Fig. 7. The handles are nearly all of the tubular Neolithic type.2 They are placed either at the rim (T. 5), a little way below it (T. I7) or low on the shoulder (T. 7), and vary in horizontal length from 3 to 8 cms. The method of attachment was apparently to pinch up two horizontal ridges from the clay of the wall and to apply over these the ends of the strip form- ing the handle. In some instances the handle has come off and the ridges below are clearly visible. T. 6 is longer vertically, and stands out more freely from the vessel than usual.3 Its edges are slightly bent up towards the centre, and it seems to shew how the transition between the tubular and the loop handle was effected. The most interesting feature of Trapeza ware is its moulded decora- tion. Seven specimens of the 'tress' shewn in T. 9 were found, although some are doubtless from the same vessel. This consists of a band of clay applied vertically and pinched up at intervals in much the same way as the later rope mouldings on large pithoi (cf. 902-1I5). T. I o is pierced horizont- ally through the top projection and the appearance of eyes which is thus given perhaps shews how the faces (T. i 1-13) originated, although they may equally well have been suggested by the front view of an ordinary handle. These tresses occur only on the 'two-storied'jars, and the decoration always stops at the junction of neck and shoulder. The faces T. I1-13 may belong to the same class of vessel, or else to bowls such as T. i. They all shew a somewhat similar physical type, with a strongly marked aquiline nose and rather long slit eyes. The fragment T. I4 may also have been intended to represent human features, since the eye and eyebrow are clearly marked, but the ridge which should form the 1 Cf. Mon. Ant. XIX p. 170 Fig. 22. 2 Cf. P of M II Fig. 3 q and r. ' This has inadvertently been photographed upside down in P1. 7.</page><page sequence="27">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. I. 31 nose is at an acute angle to these. T. 15, again, has a ridge with an eye, but in this case the 'eye' is upside down. These diagonal ridges are, in fact, rather inexplicable. It is possible that they were not purely decorative, but came down to a ledge or wing handle.' Two exceptional sherds (T. 16) shew a zig-zag pattern of very shallowly impressed dots which is paralleled at Phaistos.2 With the Trapeza ware proper were found many fragments of large cooking-pots, which must be contemporary (T. 24-7). The clay is again coarse, but the surface more frequently polished (T. 24, 26). The colour varies from orange to black, but does not shew the typical small mottling of the finer fabrics, and rounded sherds, seemingly from bases, are generally blackened right through. The rims are again upright or outsplayed, but T. 25 is turned back in an exceptional manner. One vessel (T. 26) has a series of circular impressions round the rim with two or more handles immediately below. The handle (T. 27) is almost square in profile, and has an exact counterpart from Knossos.3 Apart from the stratigraphical evidence of A 17. I'Io-I'4O S. and A 16-18. I.40o-1.7o S., the Cretan analogies of Trapeza ware cited above clearly prove that it belongs to the transitional period between Neolithic and EM I. (This was also conclusively shewn in the Skaphidhia cave, where above the existing floor-level there was found one small dark grey suspension pot, and below it nothing except Neolithic and Trapeza ware sherds, the latter being rather more frequent towards the surface.) Its foreign relations seem to confirm the suggested Anatolian element in the Cretan stock.4 The shapes of the pots are perhaps too simple and obvious for parallels to be of any value, but the moulded faces, although not identical, can only be compared with the face-urns of Troy,5 and the features which they represent are as Armenoid as anything which has yet been found in Crete.6 Moulded decoration in itself was never very common in the Aegean area except in those parts, such as Macedonia, Thessaly and Lesbos, where Anatolian connections were strong.7 Lasithi is an isolated district, and it seems as though there the oldest racial element in Crete had remained purer and developed farther along its own lines than elsewhere in the island. 1 Cf.

Three bowls with horizontal loop handles and flat bases, in a technique similar to that of the covers (4o01-9) are of unusual type (l0o-3). The clay is dark grey or reddish, the wall thick, and the surface burnished to grey or black. A large, handleless bowl was found at Amnisos,1 and a smaller one at Porti,2 while one with two horizontal handles occurred at Zakros,3 all with a burnished finish, but the shape does not in general make its appearance before MM I.4 The Trapeza examples are reminiscent of Neolithic vessels, but their handles and bases prove them to be at least as late as EM I, and it is probable that they are contemporary with the covers which they resemble, and belong to the EM II period. It is, however, possible that i o3 at least is an intentional imitation of stone, for at a casual glance it is almost indistinguishable from a stone bowl from Mallia,5 and in this case it can hardly be earlier than MM I. Several fragments (io4-8), rather finer than the above, but of similar fabric, have been included as bowls, although their shapes are conjectural. Their burnish is degenerate, and it would be unsafe to place any definitely earlier than EM II, although the base (o104) resembles some from Partira,6 which should be EM I. The squat profile of 105 should be compared with that of certain pots from Pyrgos.7 A number of sherds (I Io-I8), one complete pot (Io9) and a pyxis lid (i 19) are of the grey powdery ware which has been found on nearly all EM sites. The clay is grey throughout, and either so soft that it crumbles 1 flpCKTtKa Iq.O P. q0 Fig. C. 2 VTM p. 58, 51I6 P1. XXXIV. SBLSA VII p. 143 (not shewn in Fig. 52. CM 2322). 4 Cf.

I. 35 found, as well as tiny loop handles like those on I09. It seems likely that these lugs were merely used to attach a lid, and not to suspend the whole vessel, since their piercings are too small to admit more than a thread,' and this is further proved by the occurrence on a pot from Vasilike of real handles as well as lugs.2 These suspension pots sometimes have a low collar 3 (I09-1I2), and sometimes a projection inside the neck 4 (ii13) to receive the lid. At least five of the vessels from Trapeza are incised (I Io, i Ioa and b, I I, also the spouted bowl 205). It has been suggested that EM incision was derived either from local Neolithic or from contemporary Cycladic originals.5 It seems, indeed, to be divisible into two classes: one with its source in East Crete and degenerating towards the South and Centre,6 in which the decoration consists mainly of concentric half-circles and chevrons, running in horizontal zones; the other confined to the North and found chiefly at Pyrgos, in which the design is not curvilinear and is usually divided vertically. The former has hitherto been found only on suspension pots,7 and seems to die out when these ceased to be made, but the best examples of the latter are on a high-necked shape s which must be Cycladic in origin,9 while it also occurs on a jug of EM II type '0 and con- tinues on cylindrical pyxides until MM I.11 I 10 and I I I appear to shew an overlapping of these two classes, and the latter in particular, although apparently of the same shape as vessels with the East Cretan decoration, has the typical North Cretan vertical fish-bone pattern. The shallowness of their incision, which seems to have been done with a blunt instrument presumably not unlike a polisher, also brings them into relation with the pattern burnished wares of the centre of the island,'2 although they are probably later than these in date. It is noteworthy that incision of both types-i.e., done with a sharp and a blunt instrument-is found in the Cyclades.'3 The cylindrical lid (II9) must again be compared with a Cycladic shape,'4 although it has counterparts at Pyrgos, Arkalokhori and Salame.'5 It is unfortunately impossible to place these grey wares chrono- 1 Cf.

MONEY-COUTTS logically except to within the limits of EM. The incised suspension pots are usually attributed to EM I,1 and probably correctly so for East Crete, but in the Messara even this type seems to continue into EM II,2 while of the present specimens I I I and I 19 might well be brought down to EM III when influence from the islands was strongest.3 If the shape is uncertain the fabric by itself is not a sufficient guide for dating. Fine, polished, buff pottery, with geometric decorations in dark paint, can more easily be ascribed to EM II,4 but of this there is only one sherd (120), although several plain fragments, in the same characteristic ware, were found. The suspension pot also occurs in red clay (121-3), with or without a dark surface wash. Vessels of this kind have frequently been found on other sites.5 They differ in shape from the earliest grey ones in their lower shoulder and less pronounced collar, and should be dated to the transitional EM II-III period. 121 is an interesting example, since it possesses a collar and its clay is not burnt red right through. Some other sherds in similar fabric, red without but grey within, were associated with pottery from Trapeza ware to EM II, so that in spite of its wash it may be earlier than 122 and 123. Two small pots with perforations all round the rim belong to a type of which only one specimen has previously been found in Crete,6 although such perforations, on larger vessels, are characteristic of the early wares of Macedonia.7 The clay is red near the top, but black right through below, as though from contact with fire. The double thickening of 125 is unique, and in conjunction with this blackening towards the base perhaps indicates some sort of stand formed by a prolongation of the outer layer, in which charcoal might be placed. Both pots are probably EM, but in the absence of further parallels exact dating is impossible. Many fragments were found of bowls in red ware, with the surface either plain (126, I3', 132, I36) or more often slightly burnished with or without a slip (127, 128, I30, 133, 134, I37-44, 146-50), or occasionally with a dark wash (129, 135, I45, I51).

The rims are generally turned out (126-32, 134, 138, 142), but sometimes merely thickened with a flat top (133, 137, 139), which in two cases (135, 136) has become a definite projection.

Un- fortunately these bowls are too fragmentary for it to be possible to join any rims and bases together, but the latter seem generally to have been plain and flat (151) or with a slight groove just above the turn (148). Occasionally one occurs with a definite kick (i49), and this is seen in its most exaggerated form in I50, which is reminiscent of the black burnished example (io4) above. Handles are either horizontal (I 33, 138, 140) or vertical (143, I45). The moulding on I41 is exceptional. So little attention has previously been paid to undecorated Minoan pottery that, owing to lack of stratigraphical evidence from other sites, it is impossible to date these sherds with certainty. Those with a red or black wash are probably EM III, and 145, I5I, with added yellowish-white paint, undoubtedly belong to this period, although the former resembles the rim of a bridge-spouted bowl in mottled ware from Vasilike,' which may come from the end of EM II. Of the rest it can only be said that they fall between EM II and MM I. Bowls in buff clay are fewer. Examples of rims are given in 152-5. 156 and 157 are included here rather than with the cups owing to the lowness of their sides compared with their diameters. These six are all probably transitional between EM III and MM I, and the basket-like vessel (158) should be contemporary, since, although the quality of its paint would place it early, the only parallel to its shape is an MM I vase from Dhrakonais.2 The lid (I59) equally seems to be EM III in fabric, but to correspond with an MM I type. It should be compared with one from Vorou with dark on light decoration of the latter period.3 I60 and I61I are from their technique more clearly MM I, although there are no exact parallels for either from previous excavations. 162 is in exactly the same ware as the fine MM I cups (525-7 and 530-3 below) and must be of the same date, although, since only its base remains, the shape is uncertain. The base (163) is unusual, and possibly not Minoan at all, but it seems to resemble more closely than anything else the bases of MM II Tazzas,4 although these Tazzas, owing to their open shape, are generally decorated within. The polychrome sherd (164) is a typical example of MM II Knossian fabric, although the inward recurve of its rim is not common. The red glaze characteristic of MM Ib-II 5 is represented by one sherd only (165). There are no bowls which can be ascribed to a later date than MM II. 1 CM 5313. 2 VTM p. 78, 4965 P1. XLII. 3 'Apy.

These all appear to have had wider mouths than the true suspension pot, but the rim (202), with its inner ledge and piercing, has only to be compared with I 13 for the close relationship between the two types to be seen. The spouts are generally small and tubular, but the opening in the shoulder of 205 from which the spout has been broken off is as large as that in the usual teapot shape, and it is uncertain whether the vessel should not have been restored with a trough-ended spout. This is, in fact, altogether an enigmatic piece, since it is the only known example of a spouted bowl in this type of grey incised fabric (see p. 35), but in the question of dating it cannot be separated from 201-4. Either side-spouts began earlier than is generally supposed, or else the use of this technique and decoration continued later. Both possibilities may even be true. Although the side-spout is uncommon before EM II, there are in the Candia Museum certain grey vessels from Palaikastro 1 and Zakros 2 with tubular spouts, which should precede the Vasilike ware teapots. Moreover, the type of teapot which is commonest in the Messara during EM III-MM I times has a globular body and low collar exactly like those of the suspension pots,3 and is either handleless, or has two small horizontal handles, or even two knobs, on the shoulder, which must have been less useful for pouring than the East Cretan vertical handle opposite the spout, and which seem to be mere survivals from the primitive suspension lug. 205 did not apparently have two handles at the sides, but it may have had none at all, and if the suspension pot developed 1 CM 3209. This has two small horizontal handles at the shoulder, one on either side. 2 CM 2329.

PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS a spout during EM III, there is no reason why it should not exceptionally have done so earlier. Equally, although incised half-circles and chevrons may be typical of EM I in East Crete,1 in the South these are so roughly executed that it is tempting to regard them there as a late and degenerate form belonging at least to EM II.2 According as to whether the clay and decoration or the shape of these side-spouted bowls is given the most importance, they must be put to EM I or II, but the clay, as has been shewn in the case of the suspension pots, etc. (Io9-I9), is of no real value for dating, and the decoration is a certain guide only in the East, so that the later period seems on the whole the more likely. Bowls with tubular side-spouts also occur in red clay (206) of a type which at Mokhlos has been classed with EM I-II vessels,3 but which seem likely to belong to the latter period. These differ from the previous examples only in fabric, which is an added reason for not placing 201-5 too early, and, as Seager points out,4 the shape is one which lasts through the EM III and into the MM I age. There are no bowls with the exaggerated side spouts common in the Vasilike ware of East Crete, and only one example (207) can with certainty be ascribed to EM III. Enough is preserved of this vessel for complete restoration. The moderate spout, distinct collar, and rather flattened rim, as well as the linear and spiral decoration in yellowish-white paint on a dull black ground, make it an extremely good specimen of the period. It should be compared with bowls from Kamarais and Knossos 5 of the same date. The bridge-spouted bowl first appears in Crete in Neolithic times,6 but is not found subsequently until EM III. 208 is a sufficiently typical example of the latter period, although it is more usual for the white decora- tion to be superimposed on a dark wash rather than painted directly on the surface clay 7 and one vertical handle at the back is at least as common as two placed at the sides.8 The sherds (2o9-1o) seem to come from similar vessels, and should be contemporary. 211, with its carinated shoulder and many handles, is, on the other hand, a unique piece, and might equally well belong to MM I. Bowls with lip-spouts are represented by a number of sherds, but only two vases could be restored with any certainty (212 and 213). The former of these should, from the quality of its paint, belong to EM III,o but its 1 P of MI p. 60. Gournia p. 50. 2 VTM D. A. AIQ0. 4IQI etc. Pls.

MONEY-COUTTS A rather more advanced stage is shewn by the last two vessels in this class (218 and 219) but these must still be placed within the limits of MM I. The vertical handles at either side of the shoulder on 218 are a curious feature. In East Crete one vertical handle opposite the spout is usual,1 and in the Centre and South two horizontal handles are equally character- istic.2 The two types are not absolutely confined to their respective areas,3 but there seems to be no other example in which they have thus been com- bined. The square shoulder of 219 is perhaps copied from a metal proto- type, and resembles that of a vessel from Knossos which does not appear to have had a spout, but which has been largely restored. I.

The top of the vessel turns in at right angles to its side, and there is a small groove near the lip of the flat ledge thus formed, possibly meant to hold a cover in place. Two horizontal handles, with a concave, metallic-looking profile, project at the angle of the shoulder, one at either side, but not exactly opposite to one another. For this reason it is to be supposed that there was a bridge-spout between them, for otherwise the effect given would be quite asymmetrical. Dishes. 300. (Plates 8 and 9, Fig. I1I.) Open, more or less straight-sided, dishes are common, although most often represented by fragments. The earliest of these would seem to be 301, the polished, unevenly toned surface of which resembles that of sherds from the Trapeza ware strata A 17. IIO-I140 S., 16-18. 14o0- I"70 S. (T. 2 and 3), although from the shape of its handle it must be at least as late as EM I. 302 and 303 are shapes common in the Vasilike ware of EM II, although 303 is the largest of its kind which has yet come to light in a restorable condition.1 Their fabric is interesting in connection with that of the imita- tion Vasilike ware jugs (606-12, 615-20), for the surfaces of both vessels varies from brown near the rim to black on the base, and this variation is produced by firing, and not, as in the case of the jugs, by the use of different- coloured paints, but their clay is too coarse and their finish not sufficiently hard for them to be classed with the East Cretan specimens. They show, as do the jugs, that the mottled ware was so much admired that it was 1 For the former see Gournia p. 50 P1l. XII o; BSA VII p. 144 Fig. 52; X p. 200; Supp. I p. 6.

I. 49 copied by local potters who did not know the secret of its manufacture, and could only try, unsuccessfully, to achieve a similar effect. It is possible that some of the rims 304-10 belong to vessels of the type of 31 I, but they seem mostly to come from open plates such as 303. Some are burnished (304, 305a, 308, 31o) generally more carefully on the inner than on the outer surface, and some are left plain (305, 307, 309), but the clay is in all cases rather coarse and dark,1 and they give the impression of being for household use. They, as well as the two whole specimens, are best dated to EM II, since, except for the burnishing, they are undecorated, and although vessels of the same shape are found during EM III,2 these always appear to have light on dark paint.3 The open plates continue until MM I, but during this period they are nearly always in buff clay with geometric designs in dark paint, and are chiefly found in the Centre and South of Crete.4 317 is the only sherd from Trapeza which seems to corre- spond to this stage of their development. 3 I, with its vertical handle projecting below the base, although it is of the same fabric as the coarser dishes, belongs to a rather different class, and has no exact counterparts. Some of its base is missing, and it is possible that it had feet like the tripods (313-I4), since at present it will not stand upright, and yet is too large to have been intended for a dipper. These tripods are, in fact, of similar fabric and shape, although considerably smaller. They resemble an MM I vessel from Khamaizi,5 and seem to be the direct forerunners of the MM III tripod lamps which have since been found on the Kastellos, but from their likeness to the cups (515, 516) it seems possible that they may go back to EM III. 315 may equally belong to either period. If a lamp-handle, it is most likely to be MM I, since although lamps with stick handles from Koumasa 6 are called EM, at other sites they have been more frequently found in MM I contexts, and many occurred at Khamaizi,7 where all the finds were of this date. The sherds (316-19) are wheel-made, and therefore presumably MM I, although too fragmentary for certain dating. 316, indeed, appears to have been made on a fast wheel, and in spite of the early appearance which is given by its unevenly coloured surface, may belong to an even later period.

Fragments were found from some fifteen covers, ten of which could be restored (40 i-Io), of a type which has already occurred at many other sites.1 They are circular in shape and have an outsplayed (401-7) or vertical (4o8, 409) rim below a flat top, which often projects like the eaves of a roof at the angle where the two join (401-6). At the centre there is a hollow cylindrical handle. The clay is coarse and dark, either grey or reddish-brown, with the surface burnished to grey or black. The usual decoration consists of a number of wide grooves round the upper part (401, 403-5), and sometimes there are small knobs on the ledge which overhangs the rim (402-4). Where there is no such ledge the angle between the top and the rim may bear a moulded rope pattern of the simplest sort (406-7), or else have merely a narrow groove above and below (408-9). 410 is unique in that its rim joins its top at a very obtuse angle without a projecting ledge, and that the whole of its outer surface is ornamented with roughly scored concentric rings. Also it has two loop handles at either side, as well as the usual cylindrical one in the centre. On the whole, the Trapeza covers resemble those from East Crete rather than those from the Messara, since the latter, with the exception of a rough, un- 1 P ofMI p. 75. VTMp. Io. Mochlosp. 20.

It has sometimes been thought that these covers are dishes standing on a conical foot,3 since they bear some resemblance to Early Dynastic Egyptian tables of offering, and since no pots to which they could have belonged have previously been recovered. It seems clear, however, that this is not the case. The stand of the 'kernos' from Koumasa,4 401 403 G03 .06 408 710 4-11 FIG. 12.-COVERS. Scale, I: 6. which Evans regards as the intermediate form between them and the tables of offering, may approximate to the latter, but it has no rim and is not burnished or decorated on its convex side, whereas the covers all possess rims and are invariably better finished on the outer surface than they are within. As dishes they would stand unevenly, and the loop handles of 4Io would, if placed below the base, be inexplicable. Furthermore, at Trapeza three bowls (IoI-3) were found in exactly the same heavy, badly-baked but well-burnished ware, and, although none of the covers which could be restored seem quite to fit these, it is likely that the two types should be connected, since their fabrics are so similar that at first sherds from the one were taken to belong to the other. It is, of course, equally possible that the covers may have been used with vessels of some perishable material. In spite of their poor baking and seemingly Neolithic burnish, these covers do not appear to be earlier than EM II, since none occurred 1 Annuario loc. cit. Fig. i I. 2 'ApX. AEhr.

MONEY-COUTTS in the earliest rock-shelter burials, such as those of Agios Nikoloas,' from which EM I pottery can best be distinguished. They probably persisted into EM III, for the examples 406-9 seem later than the rest, while 410 is even further removed from the best-known type.2 The peculiar fabric of these covers made them so easy to distinguish that for the sake of reference the stratum from which every sherd belonging to one of them came was written on it before any were joined together. The results obtained were interesting, as proving the complete absence of stratification in the cave. No single one came from fewer than four strata, and although most of the fragments were found between the I6th and 19th metres, the depth at which they occurred varied between 0-0o30 and I10-I.40. Perhaps the most surprising example was 405, of which the provenance was as follows: A 5. 0o20-o-4O. A 15. 0o40-0o70. A I6. Hole 0o'30-0o60. A 17. N. .Iio-I~4o . A 20-22. o-o'30. Besides the dark covers, sherds occurred from at least three larger, undecorated specimens (41I, 411 a and b) of the same shape. Only one, however, and that represented by a single sherd, has a ledge at the angle between top and rim. These seem to have no exact counterparts from other sites, but it is reasonable to suppose that chronologically they follow immediately after the latest of the burnished examples, and thus belong to the transitional EM III-MM I period. An MM I pithos cover from Vrokastro 3 has a similar handle instead of the more usual loop variety (cf. 930), although, like all real pithos covers, it is flat, and therefore fitted into, and not over, the neck of the vessel to which it belonged. 411 may perhaps have been used with a large bowl with an outer ledge such as 146, 147, since none of the pithos rims recovered have any sort of plain collar on which it could have rested. It seems to shew that in Lasithi the ancient type survived longer than in more central districts and stylistically to complete the sequence down to MM I times. Appendix. Figure I 2a. These covers bear a striking resemblance to certain Moorish vessels of the eleventh to thirteenth centuries A.D. from the castle Arcos de la Fron- tera in Spain. These are precisely similar in shape, although they are of glazed pottery. As with the Minoan specimens, at first only the covers were found, and were thought to be dishes: then the bowl to which one belonged came to light. Mr. L. H. Riddell, who has most kindly drawn attention to this parallel, suggests that the Moorish vessels were used for 1 BSA IX p. 340. 2 Signorina Banti has already suggested that the Agia Triadha example may be of this date. 3 Vrokastro p.

If this is also true of the Cretan examples, it perhaps throws a new light on the culinary art of EM times, but modern Cretan casserole lids of metal have identically shaped handles, no doubt because these are lighter than if they were solid right through, and this would be an even greater advantage in heavy pottery. cms FIG.

Cups. 500. (Plate Io, Figs. 13-15.) The commonest type of vessel found in the cave was the round-bodied cup (501-12) of which some sixty or more specimens were represented. Fragments from them occurred in nearly all strata, but most of the complete or restored examples are from A 5. 020-0-o40. 510 was bought in Tzermiadha. The clay varies considerably in fineness and colour, but is most often coarse and dark.1 The surface is generally unslipped, but often slightly polished with some blunt instrument, the marks of which are still visible, and occasionally, particularly on the vessels with strap handles (Fig. 15 h-j), it bears a dark reddish-brown wash. In one case (5oIa) there seem to be faint traces of lines in white paint hanging from the rim, and it is just possible that this is an example of the EM I light on dark technique of which there has already been question,2 since the sherd on which it occurs is of very dark clay, roughly made, and primitive looking. The bases are flattened, or slightly concave from below (50o, 503, 504, 507). The sides are upright at the rim, but rounded below, so that they never make a sharp angle with the base. The handles are large, generally round in section, and reaching from the rim to near the base (50oi-6), or joining slightly below the rim (507-8), or extending only half-way down the side (509-12). Sometimes the last type has a flattened strap handle, but the proportion of these is small. (Variations in handles are shewn in Fig. 15.) 1 This clay seems to be local, see p. 29 n. 2. 2 See Trapeza Ware section for references p. 28 n. I.</page><page sequence="53">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. I. 57 These cups, like the dishes (302-Io), have the appearance of being made for household use, but from their numbers it would seem as though they had been offered in the cave for some ritual purpose, and this is further proved by the fact that at least three specimens (5ilia) have been 'killed' by a small hole being bored through their sides,' as though to serve the dead. 501 502 53 $04 s 5O6 501 508 f50q $10 $11 f512 ~5I3 514. 55 s 511 '1s 1s19 I520 ~21 r522 FIG.

A round-bodied cup with a large handle precisely similar to those from Trapeza was found at Knossos in one of the EM II houses on the south slope,2 and the same shape occurred at Vasilike, also in an EM II context,3 as well as in the early rock-burials 1 Cf. the iug (644). 2 PofMI p. 73 Fig. 40. 3 Trans.

Two dipper cups from Pyrgos 2 which have round bases should also be compared, although they are not of much help for exact dating. The strainer (508) has no counterparts from other parts of Crete, but a few sherds were subsequently found on the Kastellos in a mixed EM-MM stratum, seemingly from similar vessels. It is probable that the round-bodied cups continued throughout EM III, although the open, straight-sided shape was by then more common, particularly in the finer wares,3 for some of the Trapeza examples, such as 512, seem too well made to be as early as their rougher companions, and the form is found again in MM I (539-41). In this case the size and shape of the handles may be a guide for their chronology, for in general the coarser the cup the larger and rounder its handle. The handle (513) seems to belong to exactly the same shape as 510-12, although it is of different ware. It should be compared with EM II cups in buff ware from Mokhlos and Koumasa,4 although the fact that it is covered with a dark wash all over, and not decorated with a geometric design, brings it into relation with EM III fabrics. Equally 514, although resembling two cups from Mokhlos which Seager classes as EM II,5 seems, from its paint, which deliberately imitates the mottling of Vasilike ware in the same way as that of some of the jugs (6o6-12, 615-2o), to belong to the very end of this period. The next group (515-20) can be dated with more certainty to EM III, since several specimens (515, 517, 519, 520) have the linear decoration in yellowish-white paint which is characteristic of that time, and one of them (519) bears a design which for commonness rivals the modern clover leaf, although the discs round its handle are an unusual addition.6 The clay, except in the case of 52o, which is in fine buff ware, is identical with that of the round-bodied cups above, and shows much the same variations of quality and colour, but the outer surface is unpolished, and the inner merely smoothed round. The straight, outsplayed sides make a comparatively sharp angle with the base. Cups of this type have been found on all EM III sites in East Crete, and in particular in the North trench at Gournia, which yielded little or nothing belonging to any other period,' but they are rare in the Centre and South of the island, where the light on dark geometric ware of EM III has a very brief existence. At Trapeza they occurred in a proportion of less than one to five to the round-bodied type. They 1 Gournia p. 56 Fig. 37, 4. 2 'ApX. AE 1918 p. 149 Fig. 7, 28. 3 Trans. Penn. Univ. I p. 195.

I. 59 evidently continued in use there practically without modification through- out the EM III period: 521 and 522 are wheel-made, and therefore parallel in date with MM Ia at Knossos, when the use of the wheel had begun, but this is only further proof that Knossos entered the MM I period before other parts of Crete. 52 I has an exact counterpart, bothin form and decora- tion, from the town site at Gournia,1 which should be contemporary. Soon after the introduction of the wheel they seem to have given way to the finer wares described below. The pedestalled cup (included here rather than with the goblets, since in previous publications it has always been termed a cup) which is so characteristic of MM Ia at Knossos 2 is represented by two sherds only (523, 523a), but it must be remembered that this shape was probably derived from EM I chalices and EM II egg-cups, and that few of either occur at Trapeza (see 8oI-io). There are many fragments from tall, tumbler-shaped cups, but few entire specimens could be restored (524-9). These are wheel-made, generally in fine, well-baked clay of a light buff colour, but occasionally in red ware (524, 528) and sometimes with a grey core (529), probably due to a fault in the firing. The walls of these cups are thin, but never of the eggshell quality attained at Knossos. The usual finish consists of a dark, semi-lustrous wash on the outer surface, either tending to black (525, 526) or to a warm reddish-brown (527), and often with an added decoration in white (525, 529) or white and red (526). The alternating white and red panels on the latter example are particularly characteristic of East Cretan MM I wares; its horizontal S design is paralleled on the rim of a tumbler from Palaikastro,3 and on the neck of a jug from Gournais 4 which is itself of East Cretan shape. These tumblers belong, in fact, to a class which has been found on all MM I sites in East or Central Crete,5 although it is more rare in the South.6 At Knossos the shape occurs in both MM Ia and Ib and continues into MM II.7 The variety with a handle is more rare than that without, and 528-9 find their nearest counterpart in a vessel from Sphoungaras.8 524, with its cross-hatched incision, is unique, but the resemblance of this decoration on the one hand to that on the necks of 'Khamaizi' pots (645-9) and on the other to that of a base with white-painted cross-hatching (533d), as well as its general shape, date it, too, to MM I. 1 Gournia p. 38 P1.

I. 61 The open shape (531-5) is represented by even more sherds than the tumbler, although the two are so much alike that it is possible that some of the fragments grouped under 533 really belong to the previous class: 530 appears to be transitional between the two. The ware is the same in both cases, but in the present type there is a greater tendency for the surface wash to extend over the interior as well as the exterior. Handles, either round or ribbon-shaped, are also frequent (533-5). These are generally attached at the top just outside the rim, and form a wide loop reaching more than half-way down the side. Similar cups have been found in large quantities on other sites,1 but most often in the handle- less form. Both at Vasilike and at Palaikastro 2 there seems to have been some evidence for dating them rather later than the tumblers. At the former site they were rare in the lower level of house A, where tumblers and polychrome sherds were common, and frequent only in the upper one, from which polychromy had almost disappeared. At the latter they were never decorated with white or red paint, while the earlier specimens, with straight striations on the base, in shape merged imperceptibly into those with concentric striations belonging to a later period. At Trapeza the decorated examples should be contemporary with the latest phase of MM Ia at Knossos, since two of the designs (533 k and 1) are paralleled from the Kouloura Houses,3 but it is possible that those with only a dark wash are slightly later. They are all made on the slow wheel, and show straight marks on their bases,4 so that they must at least fall within the limits of MM I, and except at Knossos it is almost impossible to subdivide the pottery of this period. The next three cups (536-8) are similar to the last two groups in fabric, but their outer ribbing seems to be a feature characteristic of Lasithi.5 Several more examples with this effective form of decoration have since been found on the Kastellos, in the house F I, where it might be uncertain whether they belonged to MM I or III, but the polychrome design inside 537 is too typical of MM I to admit of any doubt as to their date. The most complete specimens are straight-sided, but there are also some small ribbed sherds (536f) which are carinated below the ribbing. The shape of 538 is quite uncertain, since only one fragment from the side remains, and this does not seem to correspond to any well-known MM I class. 539-41, with a rounded body and rather outsplayed rim, resemble 1 BSA XXX p. 62; IX p. 303.

W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS cups from Knossos, Palaikastro and Pseira,1 but the double curve of their sides is rather more pronounced. They, too, must be MM I in date, although at the last-named site the type already occurred in an EM III context. 540-I are still in the fine buff, dark-washed ware, and it is interesting to find that coarse cups such as 539 were made in exactly the same shapes as their more refined contemporaries, although presumably thought less worthy of being brought to the cave. The sharply carinated cups (542-4) are all threein fine ware. No handles whichcould be related to this shapewere found,but on other sites it generally possesses a ribbon handle, and it is probable that the present examples should be restored with this addition. Their prototypes occurred at Knossos in the Kouloura Houses,2 but they do not seem to have been common before MM Ib,3 and they continue into MM II. Unlike the preceding groups, they were more popular in the Centre and South of Crete than in the East. They are represented at Palaikastro,4 but at Knossos there are large numbers of sherds from them in all boxes of MM Ib-II date in the Stratigraphical Museum, and at Phaistos they seem to be equally frequent,5 while there are also examples from Porti and Vorou.6 The wavy-rimmed sherd (545) in red clay with decoration in chalky- white paint has a parallel, but with polychrome decoration, from Vasilike, which Evans attributes to MM Ia,7 and must also be compared with two fluted, metallic-shaped tankards from Gournia.8 It is unusual to find the decoration applied directly to the surface clay on such a developed shape, but wavy rims in plain red ware, of almost eggshell fineness, occurred at Knossos in the MM Ia deposit on the Kephala dug in I935.9 The distinc- tion between MM Ia and Ib cannot, as has been said, be made through- out Crete, and it seems best to date this type to the period in general. The straight, upright-sided cup, which is the commonest form at Knossos during MM Ib,1o although already known in MM Ia," is repre- sented by one base only (546). The shape continues into MM II, and the extremely vertical sides of the present example are perhaps an indication of its lateness, although it was made on the slow wheel.12 Moreover, if, as seems probable, it had a handle, this must have been small, and placed near the rim, which is another characteristic of the later period. The remaining cups (547-50) seem all to have been made on the fast 1 BSA XXX P1. XII a 6, P1. XII b I. IX p. 3o0 Fig. I, I a. Pseira p. 17 Figs. I and 2. 2 BSA XXX p. 69 P1.

I. 63 wheel, and cannot therefore be earlier than the end of MM I. 548, with its rather small handle, is likely (like 546) to be contemporary with the MM II of Knossos, although in Lasithi, as in other outlying districts, MM I appears to have merged into MM III without any intervening period.1 It should also be compared with a cup from Gournia which is similarly ridged.2 549 is more problematical. Its shape relates it to the carinated cups (542-4) and its ribbing, although less marked, resembles that on the carinated sherds (536f), yet its glaze has a metallic quality unusual during MM I, and the knob inside its base seems to shew that it was made on the fast wheel. It may be compared with an MM I cup from Mallia,3 but it is probably later than this in date. 550 should belong to MM IIIb, or even to LM I, since flat open cups of this type are seldom found earlier.4 It is consequently one of the latest Minoan finds from Trapeza. I. Round-bodied, Coarse Ware. 501. EM II (P1. 10, Fig. I3).-Cup of coarse clay, reddish outside with a few dark patches, but more blackened within. Slightly burnished surface, with the marks of the polishing-tool visible, running horizontally round the body. Rather concave base. Rounded sides. The handle has been restored, but many rounded handles, joining at the rim and near the base, occur from less complete cups of this type. a. One handle similar to the above, in very dark, coarse clay, slightly burnished, has faint traces of white paiht in vertical lines hanging from the rim. 502. EM II (PI. Io, Fig. I3).--Cup of coarse reddish clay. The surface smoothed, but harsh to the touch and unburnished. Flat base, rounded sides and rather high- swung, rounded handle joining at the rim and near the base. 503. EM II (P1. Io, Fig. I3).-Cup of coarse reddish-brown clay. Inner surface darker than outer, which is smoothed but harsh like that of 502. Shape as 501. Handle mostly restored. 504. EM II (P1. 10, Fig. I3).---Cup of coarse clay, black at the core, but varying from brownish-red to black on the surface. Slightly burnished outside, with the marks of the polishing-tool visible as on 501. Base rather thinner than the sides and tending to the concave. Rounded sides almost incurving at the rim. Rounded handle with a wider loop than is usual joining like that of 502. 505. EM II (P1. Io, Fig. 13).-Cup of coarse brown clay with blacker patches. Smoothed surface. Shape as 502, but handle rather high swung and joining below slightly farther from the base than is usual. 506. EM II (P1. Io, Fig. 13).-Cup of rough reddish clay with the surface smoothed and slightly burnished. Flat base. Sides rounded below, but with an almost out- splayed rim. Large rounded handle, which has become rather angular in the moulding, with the loop pinched together, joining like that of 502. 507. EM II (P1. Io, Fig. 13).--Cup of rough reddish-brown clay with smoothed surface blackened in patches, on which the marks of the polishing-tool are just visible 1 This was particularly clearly proved during the excavations on the Kastellos in the case of the house F i, which was apparently used continuously from MM I to the end of MM III but in which no MM II pottery occurred. 2 Gournia D. 38 P1.

Coarse reddish-brown clay, neither smoothed nor polished on the surface. Flat base. Rounded sides making a sharper angle with the base than is usual. Handle resembling that of 507. A number of holes are pierced through the base and the side opposite to the handle. These have merely been pushed through from outside, and inside there is consequently a ring of clay left round every hole. a. Sherds from at least one other similar vessel. 509. EM II (P1.

Rounded handle set on rather askew high at the side. 510. EM II (P1. Io, Fig. I3).-Cup of same clay as 509. Inside the surface has been wiped round with something which has dragged irregular grooves in the clay. Outside the marks of the polishing-tool are just visible, although the burnish is very low, and there is a slight groove just below the rim. Flat base with a shallow depression inside in the centre. Rounded sides and almost outsplayed rim. Rounded handle which has become rather angular like that of 506 set on high at the side.

There are two examples only, one from the Messara and one from East Crete,1 which are generally ascribed to EM I, and the dating of the former of these has recently been questioned.2 The shape first appears with the earliest buff-coloured pottery, decorated with dark paint, which slightly precedes, although overlapping with, Vasilike ware.3 None of the Trapeza jugs need be placed earlier than EM II, but 60oi, with its light polished slip and traces of a dark linear design, should belong to the beginning of this period. It greatly resembles a vessel from Tomb VI at Mokhlos,4 where the EM II deposit was pure,5 and to a lesser extent one from Amnisos.6 6o2 may be contemporary, since in shape it is paralleled by a jug with a spout unusually long for the South of Crete, from Platanos,7 which is in the characteristic dark on light technique, and it also resembles two examples from Pyrgos,8 although the dating of these is more problematical. On the other hand, it seems to shew the remains of a dark surface wash, and the harsh light clay of which it is made would be more appropriate to EM III. 603 is also impossible to date with accuracy. It is the exact counterpart of a small jug from Agia Photia,9 which, owing to its burnish and rippled grooving, was thought to be early, but the deposit in the cave where it was found included pottery from EM I to MM I. 1 P of M I p. 62 Figs. 25, 26. 2 Annuario XIII-XIV p. 87. 3 Gournia p. 50.

They are either of genuine Vasilike ware (604, 605, 614) or else are local imitations of this, in which case the clay is softer and the mottled effect is due to variations in colour in the paint itself rather than to inequalities of firing. The shapes are the same in both instances, and from the evidence of sites in East Crete, where Vasilike ware was properly stratified, these jugs must belong to EM II and the beginning of EM III.J1 It is possible that the imitations are rather later than the others, but on the grounds that pottery which has fallen into disuse is seldom copied, it would be unsafe to separate the two. The question of how the mottling of the surface wash was achieved has long been disputed. Frank- fort argues that it is due entirely to the arrangement of the embers in the kiln,2 but Signorina Banti has recently stated that at all events in the Messara the paint used must have varied in tone before any baking took place.3 From the Trapeza vessels it appears that both methods were employed, and it is natural that in East Crete, where the decoration originated, the more difficult firing process should have been common, whereas in the South the effect was artificially produced. The true Vasilike jugs shew a dark patch at the centre of each region of mottling, where the flame was in contact with the clay, which is surrounded, first by a lighter circle, then by red which shades off to dark brown according to the degree of oxidisation in the atmosphere of the kiln. The imitations have only light-coloured patches surrounded by dark brown, and the two tones do not merge, but have a hard line where they meet. The surface paint in this case is much more liable to wear off, and the whole impression given is far less brilliant. It is remarkable that punctuated designs occur only on this latter class, and at Sphoungaras a jug was found, which seems on close examination to be in similar ware, with a sharp angle at its shoulder like that of 617, and with impressed dots which, it has been suggested, are derived from the rivets of a metal prototype.4 The dots on this vessel are, however, in a single line, whereas on the Trapeza examples they are arranged in double or triple rows (610, 611 I, 616), and moreover are present only on the more rounded shapes: they are therefore more reminiscent of the stitching on leather vessels, and the double handle of 6 Io increases this resemblance, for it would imitate the rolling up of the edges of a strip of hide.5 The knobs on the neck of 612, unless merely decorative, can, on the other hand, only be referred back to metal nails. At Vasilike pottery of this type was at first thought to be wheel-made owing to the excellence of its finish," and the jugs from Trapeza in the real mottled ware also give this impression. They are, in fact, so much better turned than the rest that it is tempting to see 1 Cf. Gournia p. 50. Pseira p. 17. 2 Frankfort Studies II pp. qo if.

With the commoner painted type it is generally easy to see how the body of the vessel was built up in layers and how the neck was added later. In the</page><page sequence="69">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. I. 73 case of the sharp-shouldered jugs (617-19) the whole of the top was made separately and a projecting ring left inside which fitted into the lower part, but the clay of the two halves apparently often did not bind properly, and they have therefore come apart (cf. the MM I neck (633)). The neck was sometimes attached in the same way, but the handle, which was stuck into the wall at its lower end, making a knob in the interior even if not coming right through, then served to anchor the parts together. The wall is always thick, varying from o'5 to 1.5 cms. It is to be noticed that jugs are the only type of vessel in genuine Vasilike ware found in the cave, but both these and their imitations correspond in shape to those from other sites. The tall variety (604), which is most commonly represented, may be compared with that shewn in Gournia P1. XII 5, the more globular bodied with no. 14 of the same illustration, and those with a sharp shoulder with the example already quoted from Sphoungaras.1 Only the very rounded and rather wide-necked form (615) is unfamiliar. The grooving above the base (604, 606, 609, 616) also occurs on many jugs in the Candia Museum, although it does not seem to have been previously pointed out. The polished fragments (613) have been included here owing to their corre- spondence in shape with the mottled wares, and because plain polished pottery of this type was found in conjunction with similar wares at Vasilike.2 The three miniature jugs (621-3) should probably be assigned to the end of the EM period, but hand-made vessels of this sort vary so much individually that it is impossible to date them more closely. 621 and 622 resemble to some extent examples from Palaikastro, Pyrgos and Krasi.3 623 has a closer parallel from Rock Shelter A at Gournia,4 in which deposit none of the finds seems obviously to post-date EM II, but such evidence is inconclusive. 624-8 must be transitional between EM III and MM I. 624 resembles in shape a jug from Sphoungaras with typical EM III light on dark decora- tion,5 but it is not unlike a vessel from Krasi,6 and there is nothing to prevent it from being MM I, although jugs of that period, at least at Knossos, generally have a higher shoulder and a more definite angle where the neck joins the body.' The metallic-looking knobs on its neck are no guide, for, as has been seen, these already occur on the Vasilike types (612) of EM II-III, and they continue into MM I.8 The squat, rather angular body of 625 recalls an EM III jug from Mokhlos,9 but its neck and spout do not differ materially from those of 627 and 628, which, with their moulded 1 Slhoungaras Fig. 21 c. 2 Gournia, p. jo. 3 BSA IX p. 322 Fig. 21, lo.

The top half of this jug was bought in Tzermiadha, but its provenance was later proved by the discovery in the cave of a base which exactly corresponded in size, shape and fabric, and the whole vessel has now been restored. The spouts (630-I) are evidently from similar specimens, although their lower decoration was probably different. The double lines of paint which follow the lines of their rims should be contrasted with those on EM I-II jugs which run in one direction only, parallel to the end of the lip.2 632 and 633 should equally belong to MM I, although the decoration on the former is unusual and the latter shews how the technique of making the neck and spout separately and then applying them to the shoulder of the vessel continued in use. The restored specimen (634) has a dark semi- lustrous wash all over its surface which is typical of the same period; it resembles in shape the more globular of the MM Ia jugs from the Kouloura Houses at Knossos,3 but with an even rounder shoulder. The sherd (635) evidently comes from a different type, and should probably be restored to correspond with an askos from Koumasa.4 The shape is not common in Crete, although there are examples with flatter tops and smaller spouts from Knossos and Pyrgos,5 but, as Droop has pointed out, it has analogies with an EH mainland class.6 The moulded ridge on the present vessel is unusual, and it is possible that it was in some way zoomorphic. The next four jugs (636-9) are even more peculiar, and it is unfortunate that none of them could be restored. The clay is the same in each case: coarse, greyish buff in colour, and with a rough surface, as though from the use of straw or some other 'degraissant,' but well baked and making a metallic clink if dropped. The shape varies: 636 has the widest spout, 637 the longest neck, and 639 is provided with a handle in front as well as at the back, but all are characterised by an extremely sloping shoulder. The bases, from other sherds recovered but not joinable, seem to have been flat and comparatively large. These vessels may have corresponded in general form to an MM Ib jug from Knossos with polychrome and barbo- tine decorations,' but they themselves are entirely plain. They may equally have come near to some askoid examples from Phaistos with brown 1 JHS XXVI p. 249 P1. X I. 2 P of MI p. 62 Figs. 25, 26. Mallia I p. 49 Fig. 13. 'APX. AshT. 1918 P1. A top left.

At Palaikastro, too, a shape was found which has some similarity.2 The fact remains, however, that no exhibit now visible in the Candia Museum affords a real parallel, although from these partial resemblances it is likely that they belong to the MM I period. The miniature jugs (640-3) require no special comment. They belong to types well known at all MM I sites and especially well represented at Gournais and Krasi. The trefoil spout of 640 has a counterpart from Sphoungaras,3 where in one place the stratification of miniature jugs above EM III cups was clear, and is also paralleled at Gournais, Phaistos and Gournia.4 The knobs on the shoulder of 642 in conjunction with its dark- painted design can be matched at Knossos,5 although at other sites it is more usual to find either the one or the other of these methods of decoration employed separately. 644 is more important, since its shape brings it into relation with the well-defined type of small jug perhaps best known as the 'Khamaizi' pot which follows (645-9). The rim of this vessel is much worn, but it is un- likely that it possessed a spout, since similar specimens from Palaikastro have flat tops.6 Its clay is coarse, its fabric heavy, and it has no incision round its neck to correspond with that on the 'Khamaizi ' pots proper. On the other hand, since, judging from the inscriptions which they sometimes bear (see 645), these must have been used for some ritual purpose, it is extremely interesting to find that the present example, like the cups described under 51iia has a hole bored through its side, as though to kill it for the use of the dead. It, too, is presumably MM I in date. Of the 'Khamaizi' pots themselves, five whole examples were found (645-9), and there are fragments from six others. The ware is the same in all cases. The clay is fine and of a light buff colour, tending to grey or pink, according to the quality of the baking, and lightly polished on the surface. The shape is globular, with a more or less pronounced neck, either upright (645-7) or narrowing towards the rim (648-9), on which there is a decoration of incised lines, either running diagonally all in one direction (645, 646) or cross-hatched (647-9), and sometimes finished below by a single horizontal cut (647 and 649). There is one handle set on the shoulder, which generally seems to have been made separately and applied as a loop to the side (in the case of 647 it has split off), but which on 649 has been pinched out from the body of the vessel and then pierced through. The most important specimen is 645, which has scratched on its base three characters of the hieroglyph class. These are considerably worn, but it is 1 Feslds p. 144 Fig. I20; p. 281I Figs.

Curiously enough, this type of pot does not seem to occur either at Knossos or Phaistos, but to be confined to the East of Crete, with an extension along the northern coast to Gournais and Mallia. Many examples have already been found,4 some of which are inscribed (from Mallia and Prodhromos Botsanou). From the Khamaizi evidence it seems clear that they must be dated to MM I, and although the hieroglyph system reached its most developed form at Knossos in MM II, it was already in use during the preceding age,5 so that its occurrence on them is no real objection to their earliness, and only helps to prove that MM II was a palatial phase which chronologically overlapped with MM I in the outlying districts of Crete. Chapouthier wishes to date all the Mallia writings to the beginning of MM III,6 and would make no distinction between these vases and the clay sealings, but this is mainly because, as he points out, Mallia has no MM II palace, and there seems to be no reason why the former should not belong to the MM I occupation of the site, the existence of which is abundantly proved by other pottery. Equally it is possible that their manufacture continued longer than is generally supposed, for a ritual type of vessel may be supposed to alter less than one in common use, and it is worth noticing that on the Kastellos, in the house FI, a particularly large and well-made specimen of this class was found in a context which suggested that it should be dated to MM III. On the other hand, so little pottery from the cave could be assigned to that period that it is hard to believe that the eleven examples represented there are anything but MM I. The last vessel in this class (660) is included as a jug merely because it has a handle to assist in pouring out its contents. It is made of fine but rather soft buff clay, and has a much-worn decoration of chalky white lines on a dark wash, which proves it to belong to MM I. It has a double body, with an open neck above one half only, but with a hole between the two so that both would contain whatever liquid was placed in it.

Both halves of the vessel must have been roughly globular, but only one, which runs up to a collared neck, is open at the top, although there is a communicating hole between them. A rounded handle goes in an arch from just below the rim of the open half to the top of the closed one. Bottles. 7oo00. (Plate 13, Fig. 18.) Two small, bottle-shaped jars (7o0 and 702) in dark burnished ware are extremely primitive in appearance. 7o0 resembles a vessel from the early burials at Agios Nikolaos,1 except that it is smaller and darker, and also recalls two better-finished examples from the Agia Triadha' Tholos.' 2 702 is most nearly paralleled from Gournia,3 but the sherds from similar but larger jars which have been included with it bring it into relation with a vessel from Amnisos which is of exactly the same shape, although it stands over 30 cms. high.4 The form of both is uncommon, and does not occur in any stratified EM II deposit,5 so that it seems clear that they must belong to EM I. They are, in fact, almost the only pots from Trapeza of which this can be said with any certainty. The three small amphorae which follow are of a type which has been found on several other sites in an MM I context.6 During EM times a rather similar shape occurs, but either with vertical handles 7 or else alto- gether larger.8 Both the Knossos and Krasi examples quoted above have decorations in dark paint running more or less vertically from neck to base, and greatly resemble 70o4. Moreover, the discs which this bears have their counterparts on jugs from the former site,9 which, like the amphora, belong 1 BSA IX D. s12 Fig. 2. 2 Annuario XIII-XIV p.

(Plate 13, Fig. I9.) Fragments were found from a number of goblets with hollow conical bases. The earliest specimens (8oi, 8ola) are in the grey powdery ware described above (see Bowls Io9-I9), but this ware is so friable that the only part of them which now remains is the thick stem which comes immediately below the cup. They correspond to a type found in the Sub-Neolithic levels at Knossos,' and perhaps have analogies with the pattern-burnished chalices of Pyrgos and Arkalokhori,2 although they are so much worn and broken that it is impossible to distinguish any decoration. They probably fall within the EM I period, for although a spouted goblet in grey ware occurred in Tomb VI at Mokhlos, where all the pottery belonged to the earliest phase of EM II,3 this was of a sophisticated type and, as Seager pointed out, was itself derived from earlier vessels. On the other hand, it must be remarked that no high conical stems were found in the EM I burials at Agios Nikolaos,4 nor yet in the Sub-Neolithic-EM I cave at Miamou.5 At Trapeza the same shape occurs in dark gritty clay (804-5) apparently without any surface decoration, and two lower bases (802-3) are also in this fabric. One of the latter (802) closely resembles the base of a footed bowl from Mokhlos,6 which is dated to EM II, but again all are too frag- mentary for their chronology to be certain. Three examples in red clay (806-8) probably come rather later, although they should still, by analogy with the previous sherds, fall within the limits of EM II. They are chiefly interesting for the manner in which they shew how this class of vessel was made in two parts. 806 finishes above in a knob, which must have acted more or less as a dowel and fitted into the bottom of the cup-like top. 808 has no such projection, but is flat above, so that its other half must have been placed on it when it was comparatively dry, and the edges of the join merely smoothed over outside, by a potter with more optimism than desire for endurance. The hole up its centre is too small for the finger to penetrate, and is consequently left rough: it is unclosed at the top, where it would have been covered by the upper part of the goblet. 809 and 810 belong to the well-known type of Vasilike ware' egg-cups ' which have been found in quantity on all East Cretan EM II sites,' but, like the jugs (606-12, 615-20) mentioned above, they are not in the true 1 P of MI p. 59. 2 'AovY.

Pithoi and Larnakes. 900. (Fig. 20.) Many sherds from pithoi were found (901-26, 931, 932), representing some thirty vessels, but these were mostly too smnall and worn for it to be possible to piece them together. The earliest is perhaps 901oI, the moulding on which recalls that of the Trapeza ware cooking-pot (T. 26), although its clay is better baked. It is too fragmentary either to tell its shape or date with certainty, and pithoi are at the best hard to place chronologically, since, for the pre-palatial ages, few have been recovered from stratified sites. It should, however, ante-date MM I, and pithoi were certainly made during the EM period, for an EM III seal stone from near Kastelli Pedhiadha shews a potter at work on an exaggeratedly large vessel of this type.' The commonest variety (902-1I2) is in coarse reddish clay, the outside of which has been smoothed by an extra wetting of the surface. 909 is the 1 P of M I p. 124 Fig. 93 A. In the Pedhiadha plain, at Thrapsanos, the potters' craft still flourishes, owing to the good quality of the clay, and the ubiquitous petrol can is rivalled by modern pithoi. A few of these are also made at Pinakiano in Lasithi, the clay coming from Agios Georgios or Kato Metokhi, cf. p. 29, n. 2.</page><page sequence="83">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI.

These vessels must all have been fairly large, standing some 75 to Ioo cms. high, and their walls are remarkably thin in proportion. It is possible that they were built up in sections, and that the rope moulding which they bear was originally used to conceal the joins,' but there is no evidence from the manner in which they have broken (as there is on 914, 915) that this was the case, and it seems more probable that the moulding was derived from the tresses of the Trapeza ware vessels (T. 9), which it greatly resembles, in spite of the gap in time between the two. This moulding is formed by a narrow band of clay, pinched up at intervals between the fingers, and is applied in one or more lines, sometimes immediately below the rim (910o), but more often farther down the shoulder, which run either horizontally (902-4, 911) or else in festoons looped up so as to coincide with the junction of the handles: it must also have occurred lower on the body, for it is found on many sherds broken all round. The rims are flattened at the top and project slightly outwards. The sides do not appear to have had a very pronounced curve except in the case of 912, and form a fairly sharp angle with the flat bases. Occasionally (909) there is a hole through the wall just above the base which must have served to drain the vessel, and this is paralleled at Knossos and at Pakhyammos,2 as well as on modern pitharia in which shrubs or creepers are planted. The handles are vertical, and generally placed on the shoulder, but on 910 they spring from the rim itself: they would most often seem to have been four in number, and on this class of pithos do not appear to have been repeated near the base. These pithoi resemble more closely than anything else the vessel from Knossos quoted above. In the Pakhyam- mos cemetery, which yielded a representative collection of East Cretan types, rope moulding was exceptional, and the present shape of rim did not occur. The Knossian specimen is MM Ia in date, and the Trapeza ones are probably contemporary, although it must be remembered that MM Ia at Knossos overlapped with EM III in the East of the island. The next group (913-19) is in very gritty buff clay, decorated in three cases with the well-known trickle pattern.3 913-15 are thicker in fabric than the preceding examples, but they still bear rope mouldings, although that on 914 is slashed instead of being pinched up in the usual way.4 The rims of the last two are also different, since they curve back in a heavy collar, and shew clearly how the vessels were built up in separate parts. 916 is the most nearly complete specimen to be recovered, but even this is 1 Cf.

It and 917-18, as well as 913, have rims resembling those of 902-12, whereas the pithoi with trickle patterns from Pakhyammos always have thick collared rims similar to those of 914 and 915, but in all other respects they correspond to the examples from that site, and even the ridges of 918 are paralleled there.1 The attempted hole near the base of 916 is, however, unique, and may merely have been due to some error on the part of its maker, although it must be compared with the real hole on 909. These trickle decorated pithoi seem to have first become common in MM I, although there is mention of one from Vasilike in the third level (EM II) which should be earlier.2 At Knossos the design continues on the knobbed pithoi of MM II, but in East Crete it appears to persist right up to LM times on vessels which are quite indistinguishable from those of the present class.3 Considering how little of the other pottery from Trapeza is later than MM I, it is to this period that the present vessels must be assigned. The three pithoi in dark red ware (920-22) with ridged decoration in shape recall many specimens from Pakhyammos, where indeed vessels with ridges were commoner than those without, although their clay is local 4 and gives them a rather different appearance from those from other sites. A similar pithos was discovered by a local workman on a small terrace out- side the cave to the West during the winter of I936-37, and in company with it were fragments of two MM I bowls and a cup, so that all can be dated to this period. It is probable that the smaller jars (923, 924) are also contemporary. The two straight-rimmed pithoi (925-6) are more unusual, and it is just possible that they should be considered as some sort of chest, such as that shewn in Pachyammos P1. XII, XVII c, since their rims are exactly like those of the oval larnax (927), but in this case the bases which have been assigned to them would be too small to belong. These three vessels are all likely to be transitional between EM III and MM I. Oval larnakes of the former period have been found at Pyrgos and Pakhyammos,5 and of the latter at Pakhyammos and Vorou.6 They seem to begin earlier than the square-cornered form which is represented by 928, 929, and there is some doubt whether this last can really be ascribed to an earlier date than MM III,7 although its clay is similar to that of 913-18, and it must again be remembered that very little of the finer pottery was as late as this. 1 Pachyammos P1.

They are paralleled from several other sites,1 although, curiously enough, none seem to have been noted from Pakhyammos, where the pithoi were all inverted for burials, so that it is possible that commonly they were only used when the vessels to which they belonged were kept upright. They must at all events be contemporary with the pithoi which they resemble, and therefore be dated to MM I. Only one sherd was found from an LM pithos (93I). This bears a rope moulding with fishbone incisions similar to that shewn in P of M IV Fig. 625 a. It may belong to LM I. In I937 an LM III larnax burial was found on a terrace outside the cave to the East, but this seemed to have no connection with any of the pottery which had come to light during the previous season's excavations. 932 is certainly not Minoan at all. It resembles the rims of large store jars subsequently found both on the Kastellos and at Kolonna, and seems to belong to the Archaic Greek period. The exact use to which these pithoi were put remains a problem. Larnakes and rounded clay chests were sometimes used as coffins during EM III,2 but there is no evidence for real pithos burials before MM I, and it would have been extremely difficult, considering how small was the original entrance, to introduce a vessel of this type laden with a corpse into the cave at all. Moreover, the human remains, and particularly the skulls, were mostly found covered with a stalagmitic deposit near the side walls, as though they had been placed there without any covering.3 The evidence from the Kamarais Cave,4 in which there was apparently no indication of interments, suggests that large jars were used there as receptacles for offerings, and this may also have been the case at Trapeza. In the Messara pithos burials were noticed near the "tholos" at Porti and above the earlier deposit at Dhrakonais,5 and at Trapeza, too, there were traces of such a cemetery outside the cave; 6 but this proves little more than the con- tinuity of sacred association in spite of a change in burial customs. At Mokhlos, on the other hand, no such burials were found in any way 1 Pseira p. 19 Fig. 4; Vrokastro p. I 15 Fig. 57 c; Sphoungaras p. 60 Fig. 32. 2 Sphoungaras p. 48; 'APX.

Also in I896 Sir Arthur Evans heard of a pithos containing human remains from near the Kaca7d&amp;priS BeGhaKas below Trapeza, but this may have been later in date.

On the whole, it seems best to regard the pithoi from within the cave as receptacles for offerings, and those from without as coffins, although in date they must be contemporary.2 I.

W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS Anthropomorphic and Zoomorphic Vessels. Iooo. (Plate I3.) There is only one vessel from Trapeza which can certainly be assigned to this class. This resembles four specimens from Koumasa,' but with minor differences: two seem to represent men rather than women, one has no opening in the shoulder, and is presumed to have had one in the head which is missing; two bear dark on light decoration, and none possess any knob on the shoulder which is closed. It also recalls a larger example from Mokhlos,2 which is more realistically modelled and has openings in the breasts as well as the head. Furthermore, as Frankfort has pointed out,3 the type has Syrian analogies, and there is even a parallel from as far East as Shah Tepe near Damghan.4 The vessels from Crete all appear to belong to the EM III period,5 and the Trapeza one is, from its decoration, almost certainly of this date. The use to which they were put is more doubtful. Evans considers that the rope-like excrescences round the shoulders of those from Koumasa represent snakes, and that they consequently provide the first indication of a domestic snake cult,6 but Xanthoudides sees in these only a rudimentary attempt to indicate the arms of the figures. The manner in which the coils continue round the back of the neck certainly suggests snakes, and on the best-preserved specimen there is a further coil round the neck itself, which on Xanthoudides' theory has to be explained as some sort of necklace. On the other hand, there is no doubt that on the Mokhlos one it is arms which are intended, since the hands are clearly shewn holding the breasts, and the same attitude is implied on the others, including that from Trapeza. It is possible that there was actually some confusion in the minds of their makers, who may have found it too complicated to reproduce snakes as well as arms, but if this is admitted, their connection with a snake cult must also be allowed. Whatever their purpose, they form a distinctive group to which the present example is an interesting addition as forming a link between the southern and eastern examples. I.

(Plate I4, Fig. 21.) Fifteen seals (1-15), a scarab (16), a clay sealing (17) and an inscribed pot (18 and 645) were found in the cave, and another seal (Ioa) was recovered later by one of the local workmen from immediately outside. Eight of the seals are of ivory or bone (6-I I, 13) and the remainder of stone. The bottle shape (I-5), the animal and bird carvings (7-Io), the cones (Ioa-I2) and the three-sided prism (15) are of types already known, and the scarab is of an ordinary Egyptian class, but 6, 13 and 14 are more unusual. Curiously enough, the cylinder engraved at either end, which is the commonest form in the Messara, and also known in East Crete, is unrepresented. Owing to the rarity of parallels from stratified sites, it is extremely difficult to date these seals closely. Only five EM seals come from pure deposits: an ivory cylinder from Tomb VI at Mokhlos, where all the early objects belonged to EM II, two signets from Sphoungaras found with pottery of the same period, and two others from an EM III level on the town site at Mokhlos.1 None of these entirely resembles the Trapeza specimens, although the design on one of the Sphoungaras signets is similar to that on 5 and 7, and the horizontally pierced rings at the top of those from Mokhlos may be compared with that on 6. The bottle shape (I-5) is generally considered to be characteristic of EM III, although derived from an earlier type.2 The design on I recalls that on an ivory cylinder from Agia Triadha,3 but in general effect rather than in detail. The spider sign on 2 is already known on primitive picto- graphic seals, and is found in a slightly modified form on prisms with hieroglyphs of Class A: 4 it should thus belong to the transitional EM III- MM I period. The fact that it is made of rock crystal rather than steatite also argues that it is not of very early date," and the same is true of 4 and 1 Mochlos pp. 54 and io8 Fig. 24 VI 26. Sphoungaras p. 52 Fig. 25. (It is not absolutely clear from the text that there was no intrusive EM III element in the stratum where these were found.) AJA I9o9 p. 279 Fig. 3. Evans would also include a signet and a curved cylinder from Tomb II at Mokhlos as EM II (P of M I pp. 83 and 94), but there was one EM III jug in this tomb, and the signet resembles those from the town site, quoted above as EM III, while the coil pattern on the cylinder looks almost later. 2 P Of M I D. 12 I.

Seals in the shapes of animals or parts of animals are common, par- ticularly in the Messara, and seem as a rule to date from EM III.3 They are generally held to shew Egyptian influence,4 although also possessing Syrian parallels,5 and the monkey on 7 is certainly rather Egyptian-looking.6 This seal is comparable to one from Platanos formed like a squatting ape,7 but its workmanship is far more skilful. The surface of its ivory is worn, and its outlines consequently blurred, but it is still a thing of remarkable beauty and delicacy. Its design is of the same type as that on 5 (see note 2). The exact animal represented by 8 is obscure: it might equally well be a dog or some small rodent. The holes which have been cut for its eyes may once have been inlaid, although no seal or amulet on which such inlay remains has yet come to light.8 The grid pattern on its base is similar to that on I I, and perhaps shews the origin of the more complicated engravings on two specimens from Platanos.9 The bird (9) recalls a seal from Koumasa 10 and another from Agios Onouphrios 11 which Evans brings into relation with an example from the Hauran, but is simpler in conception, and has for stamp a mere series of parallel lines. Io is in poor condition below, and shews no trace of engraving, but since the double- headed form is characteristic of amulets rather than of seals, it is possible that it never had any.12 I VTMP1.

MONEY-COUTTS The high conical type (IOa-I2) again cannot be certainly attributed to an earlier date than EM III. Ioa, although of no artistic merit, is a unique and interesting piece. It is formed from a large tooth which has been cut off square at the bottom, roughly ground down above, and pierced horizontally and vertically, but is otherwise in its original condi- tion, and still has some of its enamel adhering. It is thus of the most primitive execution imaginable, but it seems to shew how much of the EM ' ivory' may have been obtained (although the idea of using ivory and bone at all for seals must have been derived from Egypt or Syria 1), and also the origin both of the curved cylinders which have been so frequently found on other sites 2 and of the true conical class exemplified in I1I and 12. Its nearest parallel is from Platanos.3 11 is fashioned with more care. In shape it has many counterparts from the Messara,4 but the four-legged animal on its base is too indeterminate for comparison with other designs. It has a small silver rivet through its side and the hole from which another has dropped, but these seem to have been purely decorative, and not to have been used to join an ancient break, as was the case with a copper rivet through the cylinder already referred to (p. 95, n. I) from Mokhlos. 12, of green steatite, is of exactly the same shape as I I. It resembles a seal in the Candia Museum said to be from Knossos,5 but has a more interesting parallel from Tel Abu Gelgel, which Hogarth considers unusual in Syria and possibly itself of Aegean origin.6 I3 is an unusual type, but seems to be best regarded as a modification of the conoid class, which is sometimes square in section.' Its face is comparable to that of 5 and 7. 14, in black steatite, is certainly not earlier than EM III,8 and is more likely to date from MM I, since it does not correspond to any well-known EM shape, and its design is similar to that of a clay seal from an early house at Gournia,9 as well as resembling that of the sealing 17 (see below), both of which seem best attributed to that period.1o The prism (I5) should be of the same date, although this type is 1 PofMIp. 83. 2 In particular P of M I p. 94 Fig. 64 from Mokhlos (Mochlos p. 34 Fig. 12 II 41). 3 VTM p.

This seal is unique in having a dark surface wash, and seems itself to be an imitation of black steatite. The design may, however, go back to EM II, since it is found on a limestone cylinder from Mokhlos which was associated with sherds of that period (Mochlos p. o109 Fig. 54). 10 This design also occurs on a bronze stamp from Thermi (Lamb Thermi p. 171 Fig. 50 P1. XXV), which unfortunately was not stratified, and Miss Lamb connects it with that on the Anatolian seals already quoted as parallels to 5 and 7 (see p. 97, n. 2).</page><page sequence="95">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. I. 99 said to make its first appearance in EM times.1 It should be compared with a similarly shaped seal said to be from the adjacent site of Koprana, which also has on one face a dog with its head turned back,2 and with another from Gortyna with a goat, a single star, and a potter.3 The most conclusive reason for its dating is the similarity of the dog to the animal scratched on the Khamaizi pot (645 and 18 below) which, as has been shewn, must belong to MM I. The scarab (16) is undoubtedly an Egyptian import. In general style it shews the careful naturalism which is characteristic of the beginning of the XIIth Dynasty,4 and there is nothing in its detail to vitiate this dating. The front of its clypeus is unfortunately broken, but the three lines on its back, and its single girdle with a modified curl in front, as well as its rather square head, are all features common at that time.5 The scrolls on its base have many Egyptian analogies, although less symmetrically arranged than is usual.6 They belong to a type of design which may originate rather before the XIIth Dynasty, but which is most frequent during that period, and has a fairly prolonged later existence.' Nine XIIth Dynasty scarabs have previously been found in Crete,s but the present example is the best which has as yet come to light: none are from the East of the island, but one in amethyst from the Diktaian Cave, engraved with Minoan hieroglyphs of Class A,9 affords an interesting topographical parallel to that from Trapeza, although another from Platanos stylistically comes nearer to it.lo In date it must be placed about 2000 B.C., and therefore belongs to the MM I deposit in the cave.1 Since seals were probably buried with the dead to whom they belonged rather than brought as offerings, and since there is some evidence that the latest interments are of the EM III-MM Ia period,'2 it should be rather earlier than the fully developed MM I pottery, but this, as has been pointed out above, is itself contemporary with MM Ib-II at Knossos.'3 The sealing (I 7) may perhaps come from the side of some large jar or 1 P of MI p. 123 ; Scripta Minoa p. 130. 2 JHS VII P1.

Metal was comparatively rare in the cave, but gold, silver, bronze (or copper) and lead are all represented, so that in spite of the disturbed condition of the whole deposit, some idea of its original wealth may be obtained. It must be remembered that until the EM II period metal of any kind was practically unknown in Crete, so that the rapid spread of its use and the skill with which it was worked shew the receptiveness and ingenuity of the early inhabitants of the island. I. Gold. The 1936 excavations yielded only nineteen fragments of gold, but two others had been found in the cave by Sir Arthur Evans in 1896, and considering the amount of robbery which the place must have suffered both in ancient and in modern times, it is to be inferred that it was once at least as rich as were the tombs of Mokhlos or the tombs of the Messara. All but three of the fragments recently recovered are too much crumpled and torn to be distinguishable. I I seems to belong to a class of pendant well represented at Mokhlos in the richer EM II-III tombs; 1 I 2 may come from a diadem of the kind shewn in Mochlos, Figs. 8 and 9, which Evans regards as the prototypes of the Mycenae death-masks,2 or else merely have been used as a coating over a core of some perishable material; I 3 is more unusual, but is too incomplete to be regarded as a new type: on each there are traces of the common EM repoussd decoration.3 The two pieces previously brought to light are both leaf-shaped, and may have formed part of ornamental sprays,4 or else have been used as single pendants.5 One is ornamented with embossed dots round the edges and down the centre, but the other is plain. Goldwork of this sort seems, from the Mokhlos evidence, to have been most flourishing during EM II,6 and in the Messara, too, one of the richest tombs must have been Kalathiana, which, from the other objects found there, seems to have fallen into disuse shortly after the close of this 1 Mochlos p. 30 Figs. 8 and 9, II 15; p. 31 Figs.

I. 103 period.' There is, however, nothing to distinguish the jewellery of EM II from that of EM III, and gold ornaments persisted without any revolutionary variations in style throughout Minoan times.2 The question of where the Minoans obtained their supply of gold and their knowledge of its work- ing remains obscure, but if, as Frankfort suggests,3 both were derived from the Caucasus region, this lack of development in technique may be ex- plained by the fact that there the same types continued in use for a very long period, while in Crete the metal was too valuable to be wasted in experiment. The Trapeza fragments should probably all be assigned to within the limits of EM II and III, but rather owing to the preponder- ance of other finds of this date in the cave than from any intrinsic distinction in their appearance.

In Crete during the EM period silver was used far less than gold, although in the Cyclades it appears to have been the commoner metal.4 It has been found in East Crete and in the Messara, and, like copper and bronze, occurs both in the form of ornaments and for more practical purposes.5 The cutter or toilet knife II I is the only silver object found at Trapeza, with the exception of the rivet remaining in Seal I 1. It is of exactly the same type as the copper or bronze implements III 1-6, and although its three rivet holes are unusual,6 it cannot be separated from them, 1 VTM p. 82 P1. XLIII b. As well as at Mokhlos and in the Messara EM gold has been found at Sphoungaras (Sphoungaras p. 52 Fig. 4) Pyrgos ('ApX.

MONEY-COUTTS but must also be dated to EM II-III, for the occurrence of silver in Tomb VI at Mokhlos proves that it was used as early as the beginning of the former period, and the cutters themselves fell out of use at the close of the latter (see below). Evans has suggested either an Anatolian or a Spanish source for Cretan silver,1 but the former seems the more probable, since the type of kantharos which chiefly attests to its use in MM times,2 and which has been found both in the original metal and in clay imitations, is closely paralleled by a similar imitation from Alishar II,3 which must be too nearly contemporary with the Minoan vessels for the resemblance to be fortuitous. It is, however, possible that the origin of these particular vessels may lie farther East, and silver itself is known to occur within the Aegean area.4 II I. EM II-III (P1.

Copper and bronze are poorly represented, and small objects, such as may be supposed to have escaped the eyes of previous robbers, predominate. The actual metal has not been analysed, but although copper is known to be more frequent in EM, and bronze in the later periods, there are as yet insufficient data for the distinction to afford any certain chronological evidence.5 Ancient slag-heaps from copper-working have been found in Crete at Khrysokamina, near Pak- hyammos and also on the island of Gavdhos,6 so that although a knowledge of its use was probably due to alien influence at the beginning of the EM age,' the ore itself is likely to be native. Any tin alloy, on the other hand, seems to have come from abroad.8 The earliest implements from Trapeza appear to be the small cutters (III I-7), and these are probably of pure copper. They seem to be divisible into two classes, one very short and square (III 1-6), and the other longer and more flaring (7). They presumably all once possessed handles, of ivory, bone, or wood, comparable to that of III I, which were attached 1 P ofMII p. 169 n. 2; ibid.

I. o05 by rivets.1 Similar blades have been found at Mokhlos,2 Palaikastro 3 and in the Messara.4 That from Tomb VI at Mokhlos must belong to the beginning of EM II, and those from Tombs II and XIX may be equally early, although there were a few EM III finds in these two deposits. That from Palaikastro, however, was associated with 'a common yellow cup' and with an ivory seal which it is impossible to date earlier than EM III, and two of those from Platanos come from 'Tholos' B, which, from its pottery, does not seem to have been in use until this time. It is therefore clear that the type was common throughout both EM II and III, but it is equally certain that it died out before MM I, for it has never been represented in any pure deposit of that period. The use to which these implements were put is obscure. They were once termed single axes,5 but the dis- covery of their handles at Mokhlos, Platanos 6 and now at Trapeza 7 makes this definition untenable; moreover, real single axes have been found at Agia Photia, Sphoungaras and Palaikastro,s which have a hole for the haft and no rivets. The specimens from the Messara have been described as amulets rather than real cutters,9 owing to their smallness and thinness, but one of the present examples (III I) shews distinct signs of wear at the edge, while, as Mosso points out 10 (although to prove a different theory), if they were votive, one would expect to find their practical prototypes, and none have yet been brought to light in Crete.' On the other hand, it is true that they have never been found unconnected with burials, although the lack of any small finds from EM house deposits makes this fact lose much 1 Those on which only one rivet-hole now remains seem to be broken at the top, and may have had others to prevent the blade from swivelling. Cf. the silver one II I which has three, and two tweezer blades from Mokhlos (Mochlos p. 73 Fig. 44, XIX 25), which have two arranged one above the other instead of side by side. All these Trapeza examples are, however, too short to be termed tweezers. 2 Mochlos Fig. 25, VI 29; Fig. 44, I 1, XIX 29, 30, 32, XXI 20; p. 36, II 50; p. I07. 3 BSA VIII p. 296. 4 VTM p. 28 P1.

A similar type, but rather longer occurred at Gournia (Gournia p. 34 P1.

This handle is of copper, but made separately from the blade. Seager mentions one in which both are in one piece (Mochlos p. 107 n. 2). ' The handle and blade of this cutter were separate when found, but from the exact correspondence of the rivet-holes through each there is no doubt that they belong. 8 Gournia p. 56; Sphoungaras p. 68 Fig. 41 ; BSA Supp. I p.

MONEY-COUTTS of its significance, and also, although not themselves known to occur in MM I, they are apparently shewn in the hieroglyphic script of that period,' which seems to argue that they may once have had a symbolic meaning. On the whole, however, it seems best to regard them as Seager did, as 'playing some part in the intricacies of the Minoan toilet,' 2 their most likely use being as razors. Similarly shaped cutters were found by Tsountas in Syros, with marble saucers sometimes containing traces of colouring matter, pounders, tweezers and obsidian razor flakes, and were regarded by him as having some connection with the toilet.3 They are larger than the cutters from Trapeza, but paralleled in size by examples from Mokhlos and Koumasa.4 The handle (III 8) may be from a blade of the above type, or possibly from a larger knife. Its two halves are riveted together, but it is not shaped below so as to fit neatly over its blade, as is the handle of III I, and it is pierced above as though for suspension. It seems to have a counterpart from Zakros,5 and may also be compared with the bone object Miscellanea n below. The two small pointed blades (III 9 and Io) are much worn, and are probably only the points of daggers. If this is the case, III 9 may well belong to the triangular type 6 which is otherwise unrepresented, and should therefore be dated to EM II or III. The long dagger seems to begin almost as early as the triangular,7 but to persist long after the latter had fallen into disuse, and eventually to develop into the more sword-like shapes. The three blades (III I I, 12 and 13) all seem to fall within the limits of MM I, and may be either of copper or bronze. The very heavy rib on III i I is apparently a feature characteristic of South and Central Crete, for there are examples with it 1 JHS XIV p. 305 sign I6. The symbol is frequent, and Evans considers it may represent an instrument for cutting leather. It is found in a short and a long form, both with round blobs to represent the handle. 2 MOChlos p. 21.

Many also appeared during the first excavations in the Arkalokhori Cave, where the pottery was equally early (BSA XIX p. 44 Figs. 7 and 8), but this is uncertain evidence, since bronze swords and axes found on the same site in I935 were much later in date (P of M IV 346) and some at least of those from the earlier dig should be contemporary.</page><page sequence="103">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. I. lo7 from Koumasa, Platanos, Pyrgos and Teke,' but none from the East of the island. At the first of these sites two similar blades in silver were found, while at all four, Cycladic figurines occurred, and it seems possible that the type originated in the islands.2 The rib was evidently a device for strengthening the blade,3 which, being in comparatively soft metal, might otherwise double up under the impact of a blow, and for this reason it is not such an advanced development as it at first sight appears, and, owing to its obvious disadvantages, was later modified. Xanthoudides is probably right in assigning those daggers which shew it most distinctly to the transi- tional EM III-MM I period. III 12 greatly resembles three examples from Mokhlos,4 one of which (from Tomb III) was stratigraphically dateable to MM I, and may also be compared with weapons from Gournia and Pla- tanos.5 It seems to be the most characteristic type of the time, and still to shew the influence of the earlier and broader shape in its spreading top. III 13 may be rather later. Its lengthened tang recalls that of a dagger from Khamaizi which Evans regards as belonging to the fully developed MM I style," and is also comparable to those on two specimens from Platanos which are thought to post-date most of the Messara types.7 It may be transitional to the tanged, square-shouldered shape, which is commonest in MM II.8 The nails (III 14-16) must have fallen from daggers similar to the above, and one was indeed found in III 12, but subsequently shaken loose. The number of rivets on these weapons seems to vary arbitrarily between two and four, and to give no clue for dating. A. Cutters. III i. EM II-III (P1. i5).-Small cutter or toilet knife.

The stone vases can be related most readily to those of Mokhlos, as one would naturally expect from other parallels, such as gold-leaf ornaments and bronze cutters or spatulae.4 They can most of them be dated within the limits of EM II-III, and a number of them, judging from the fine materials and delicate workmanship, should be dated to the earlier period. A number of parallels to the finer vases come from EM II burials and confirm the impression.

A small, finely worked bowl of green steatite (Io) should be EM II, judging from material and workmanship: a bowl similar in shape but of grey marble comes from Tomb XXI at Mokhlos.a Two saucers (II and 12) one of striated marble, the other of green steatite, with four rectangular lugs on the rim, have a parallel 4 from an early deposit at Mokhlos, from Tomb XIX, where all the objects except three were EM II. It is interesting to note that this type is also common in Early Cycladic burials in Syros,5 where six contained traces of colouring matter." Tsountas considers that their use was connected with the toilet. A deeper bowl (13) of variegated striated marble, has two lugs and resembles one from 'Tholos' B at Koumasa: 7 another bowl of grey steatite (I4) has a slight foot and four rim lugs which project less and are more roughly formed than those of II and 12. It somewhat resembles two bowls from Porti.8 A bowl of striated marble with three rectangular rim projections like those of i i and 12 and a short trough spout (17), recalls a bowl from Syros similar in type, but mounted on a pedestal,9 and it also has parallels 10 from Tomb IV and Tomb I at Mokhlos. Another bowl (18) with open spout and three oval rim projections each pierced with two holes for suspension, is of green steatite and incised: its material and incisions resemble the lid with the sleeping dog from Mokhlos.'1 Three bowls with distinct bases have been grouped together in the subsequent catalogue under section D: of these 19, which is of black steatite with small base and flaring sides, with roughly formed lugs on the rim, judging by material and workmanship, is one of the later of the stone vases, though perhaps no later than EM 111.12 20, a pedestalled bowl of green steatite, is very thin and finely worked, and should be grouped in date with the earlier vases: in shape it is like the EM II-III pottery' egg-cups ': there is an example a13 very like it from Tomb XXI at Mokhlos, with a more graceful pedestal.

Two other pedestalled cups are of the well-known MM I 'egg-cup' shape; 25 is of crystal and has a tall base; 26 of marble with a lower and more typical base: a similar cup in grey steatite was found in' Tholos ' A at Agia Triadha.' A number of charming miniature jars were found all of green steatite, of one type with minor variations (27-33): they all have bases: 32 has a tall pedestal and is slender; 2 27, 28 and 29 have a more rounded body; the base in 30 and 31 is grooved, and 32 has a groove below the rim. They may be EM II or III, as similar examples were found in Tombs II and XIX 3 at Mokhlos, where they are probably EM II, but one comes from Tomb IV,4 where the early burial was EM III: 5 these were with one exception of green steatite. Two somewhat similar miniature jars were found in the Messara, one in 'Tholos' A at Agia Triadha,6 of grey steatite, and the other of the same material from Koumasa.7 Neither of these has a high foot: the Agia Triadha jar has grooves below the rim; that from Koumasa is ridged at rim and base. Judged as a whole, the stone vases of Trapeza, though they fall short of those of Mokhlos in variety of colour, and show no workmanship quite so delicate as that displayed by the finest of Seager's discoveries, are not unworthy to be ranked with them. Various other objects in stone were found which had been of use for one purpose or another. Obsidian blades (34 a-s) appeared in the cave in some number, as they have done at so many Early Bronze Age sites in Crete,s the Islands 9 and on the Mainland.1o The length of the blades varied from 5"5 to 2 cms. 35 was evidently a weight: the top is pierced, so it was intended for suspension. It resembles in shape a muller from Gournia," which is probably later. The whetstones (36-40) are of various shapes, being just lumps of stone convenient for the purpose. Some whetstones from the Messara are more elaborate: they are long and narrow and pierced at each end.12 One of the pounders (41) was a naturally shaped piece of hard black 1 Annuario XIII-XIV p. 32 Fig. 5I. 2 Mochlos FiE. 7 II h. 3 Ibid.

The Trapeza pestle does not taper upwards, whereas the Gournia example is shaped like an Indian club. One of the two stone axes (43-4) is of the long type, and has an edge with the same curve as a Neolithic celt from Knossos.2 The other is short and broad with a somewhat straighter edge.3 The use of stone axes continued, of course, into the Bronze Age.4 There are two small objects (45 and 46) roughly pyramidal in shape, whose purpose is not clear; perhaps they are the rough blocking out of seal stones.

I7 parallel a well-known class from the Messara that it is evident that the type is an importation to Lasithi. This primitive class shows three varieties at Trapeza: (I) a long, almost rectangular flattened body with a rough indication of a head of which I, the large marble figurine,' is a rough example, as it shews merely a groove for the neck, while 2 in crystal has the head well separated from the trunk by an indentation to show the neck; 2 (2) figurines which are widest at the shoulder and taper downwards to a point (3 and 4): the neck is indicated by an indentation and the roughly shaped head tapers upwards with a backward slope; 3 (3) a type similar to the last, but with small stumps to indicate the arms (5). The arm-stumps are paralleled in the Messara, where in one case 4 these occur on a figurine which is otherwise exactly like Type 2 at Trapeza. 5, which is very smoothly carved in white calcite, follows below the armpits the line of a rather thick-set human body in a long robe, and does not taper to a point when seen from the front, though it tapers from back to front. Another figurine 5 from 'Tholos' A at Agia Triadha with arm stumps shews a similar moulding of waist and hip line to 5, but comes to a point below. Variations in type 2 and 3 from the Messara are an incision to show the waist-line 6 and a very pointed beard or chin.' Another primitive type from the Messara, cloaked and cut off straight across the base, with hands folded on the breast,8 had no parallel amongst the Trapeza finds. The examples of this type from Agia Triadha shewed indications of features, while those from Koumasa have no nose, eyes or mouth, but where the heads exist there is a very pointed chin or beard. The primitive class represented at Trapeza by Nos. I to 5, with their parallels from the Messara, was noted by Professor Halbherr9 and Sir Arthur Evansl o as recalling Egypto-Libyan prehistoric figurines from Naqada: 11 of these the male figurines shew the very pointed chin or beard, while female figurines taper downwards to a point. The male figurines have a straight base, and an indentation above it sometimes right across,12 sometimes only at each side.'3 1 Prof. Karo suggested that this might be a phallus. 2 For this type cf. VTM P1. XXXIX 172 Porti. Some figurines from the cave at Pyrgos very roughly approximate to this shape. 'ApX. As'r. IV 1918 p. 163 Figs. 14, 252, 253, 255. 3 Cf. Annuario XIII-XIV Fig. 58e; VTM P1.

I. 119 Other figurines from Naqada are narrow and rectangular, divided by an indentation from a small base; two examples shew the head with a pointed beard.2 Signorina Banti strongly denies any kinship between the predynastic Egyptian figures and the Cretan figurines. She stresses the great difference in time which separates them, and claims that there is far less likeness between the Naqada figurines and those from the Messara than has been claimed.3 She upholds the theory that the Cretan figurines are derived from native steatopygous types, assuming as a parallel a development of the Cycladic marble figurines with marked human forms from the violin-shaped figurines.4 But there seems no distinction in date between the more developed Cycladic figures and those of'formless' type, judging from Tsountas' account of the tomb groups in the islands of Amorgos, Paros, Antiparos, Despotikos and Syros.5 The 'formless' type of violin- or even more simple shape is more common in Paros, Antiparos and Despotikos: in Amorgos only the 'human' type occurs, in seven examples, while in Syros both kinds are found, though in small numbers. With regard to the difference in date between the Naqada and the Messara figurines, it seems feasible that in Libya itself a primitive style in art might persist long after it produced the figurines at Naqada at the period of Libyan influence there, and that from Libya itself in later days such figurines were introduced into the Messara, together with Libyan ideas of burial exemplified in the tombs." Nor can such marked resemblances be overlooked as the very pointed chin or beard, and the dome-like head, nor the tapering body, though in Egypt that feature is distinctive of the female figures.' Another resemblance is that of the rectangular shape of Trapeza Nos. I and 2, and their parallel from Porti,s to Naqada figurines of narrow rectangular shape.9 The incision marking off the base of the Naqada figurines has no parallel in Crete, except in so far as it occurs as a division of the body where an incision shews the waist-line.10 The heads of the Naqada rectangular figurines are com- pletely different from those of the Cretan rectangular type. It seems much more likely, judging from the resemblances quoted, that the primitive figurines from the Messara and Trapeza have Libyan antecedents, than that they are derived from native Cretan Neolithic prototypes. They no doubt belong to EM II, since no objects were found 1 Petrie Naqada P1. LIX 9, Io. 2 The beard in the prehistoric Egyptian figures is indicated by lines, ibid. Pl.

MONEY-COUTTS in 'Tholos' A at Agia Triadha, where so many of the figurines were found, which can with certainty be dated to EM I. One of the 'shapeless' figurines referred to, from Syros,' gives the closest Cycladic parallel to the two other figurines of a primitive class from Trapeza (6 and 7). These are apparently made of shell (cf. P of M II 46). The heads of both the Cretan examples have more resemblance to a human head than any Cycladic examples of this or the violin- shaped type, where the head is represented in most cases by a long, rectangular projection.2 6 has a rounded head; neck and shoulders are indicated and the figurine is rounded off below. 7 is similar, but head and body are more rectangular, though the base is slightly rounded; the body of the Syros example is flask-shaped. The Trapeza figurines are not flat strips of stone, but their outline seems to bear a sort of family resemblance to a type of primitive sepulchral figurine, nearly always female, which is found over a wide area.3 They should probably be dated EM III, as are the more completely formed Cycladic figurines found elsewhere in Crete.4 The six bone figurines (8-13) shew an advance on the primitive stone figurines of the Messara type, and should probably be dated EM III, as being less advanced than figurines dated MM I from other sites.5 They are evidently a local product of Lasithi, as so many examples of the type were found in the Cave of Trapeza, while only one counterpart has so far been found in Crete-a fragmentary example from 'Tholos' A at Agia Triadha.6 The stocky little figures, evidently male, give a very life-like and vigorous impression, in spite of their unnaturally square cut heads and lack of features, except for a straight incision for the mouth and a certain indication of nose caused by the sloping back of the sides of the face: the back of the head is flat, but the line of the jaw is stronelv marked. The figures wear divided aprons: a triangular 1 'Eq. ApX. 1899 p. 97 Fig. 30.

Two bone figurines 1 from 'Tholos' A at Agia Triadha shew more indication of facial feature, but do not thereby give a less primitive impression, as one has a completely round head and looks like a Dutch doll, while the other, with its widely spaced round eyes, high-set ears and widely slit mouth, is quite monstrous. The body of the second is not unlike the Trapeza bone figures in general appearance, but the folded arms are not indicated in the same way: there is no apron and only a straight belt: the first has a belt and loin-cloth, but the arms, now missing, had been attached separately. A small seated clay figurine (14) is very rough and has stumps for arms, and the shape of the face is only vaguely indicated. It dates itself as MM I by its round raised cap.2 A pottery head from one of the Proto-palatial houses at Knossos has a similar headdress,3 and is almost equally sketchy, though the nose is well indicated. The Trapeza figure is not joined to its little arm-chair: they were found separately, but the exact identity of the clay and surface established their connection. The chair has very short stumps for legs and low arms and back. No parallel has so far been observed. There are, of course, seated Cycladic figures.4 15 is an ivory head, with traces of shell inlay round the eyes. The back is flat with a socket for the attachment of another piece. A first impression was that it might be Mesopotamian or North Syrian: it does not seem to be Cretan. A. Primitive. i. EM II (P1. I8).-Large marble figurine. Almost phallus-shaped. Height II "4 cms.

MONEY-COUTTS but they appear not to have been previously found in bone in Crete, although there are Italian examples in this material.1 Xanthoudides is doubtful whether these objects should be termed whorls, buttons, pin heads, knob handles, or pendants,2 and Mosso shews that they would be unsuitable for spinning,3 so that on the whole it seems best to classify them as beads, but both their use and their exact date must remain uncertain. Objects of Unknown Use. The four bone objects i-o are all rather enigmatic. I is evidently the point of some small tool of the kind found at Miamou, Magasa, Kamarais, and Knossos.4 It was recovered from a fairly low level (A 4. 0o.6o-o.8o), and may well date from the earliest occupation of the cave, although similar implements probably continued in use after the advent of metal, m may be compared with some amulets from Agia Triadha said to be images of bandaged corpses and to resemble Egyptian examples,5 but the parallel is not close. n appears to be one half of a knife handle, and in this case the holes through it must be meant for bronze rivets similar to those in III 8, but presumably larger. On the other hand, it occurred in A 17. IIO0-I'40 N., almost at the point where this adjoined the Trapeza ware stratum A 17. IoIO-I-40 S., and seems to have a counterpart from Agios Nikolaos,6 which should not be later than EM I: but rivets are unlikely to have been used before EM II. o is certainly mysterious. It might be part of a handle, but has more the appearance of an inlay,7 and held in one position bears some resemblance to the face of a cat or lion. It is at all events too worn to be of much importance. The two flat, roughly-shaped sherds p and q may have been used as palettes,8 polishers, or even counters. Both shew traces of a dark semi- lustrous surface wash, and seem from their fabric to be not earlier than EM III, but they have no published Cretan parallels. Pestle or Pounder. The pestle or pounder (r) is of the same material, apparently shell (cf. P ofM II p. 46) as the two figurines (6 and 7).

It is interesting that these objects should have such a wide distribution, and the resemblance between all the examples so far known, as well as their comparative agreement in date, is so striking that it seems as though they must have had some common place of origin. They certainly seem to represent a common fashion in the use of implements, which prevailed widely in the Aegean area, and has relationships with Egyptian ideas. In Syros as well as pounders 5 similar in shape to that from Trapeza, marble saucers were found sometimes with traces of the dark blue colouring-matter which had been crushed in them; 6 similar saucers, without trace of colouring-matter, were found at Trapeza. The occurrence of such pounders, and also of bronze cutters or spatulae,7 tweezers 8 and obsidian razor flakes in Crete, the Cyclades and on the mainland, is noteworthy. I. Beads. a.

So many generations of treasure-seekers had, however, broken the majority into small pieces, that the total number of burials will never be known. Even allowing, however, for the possibility of several fragments belonging to a single skull it is unlikely that less than a hundred people were buried in the cave during the Early Minoan and perhaps the first Middle Minoan period. NOTE OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. By Prof. J. Kumaris, of the Anthropological Museum, Athens. With additional notes by Dr. W. L. H. Duckworth. From the excavations of the Cave 'Trapeza,' near the village of Tzermiadha in Lasithi, Crete, were brought and deposited in the Anthropological Museum of the University by Mr. J. Pendlebury, who conducted the excavations, various human bones and some of other animals, which were found in burials datable to the period 3000 to after 2200 B.C. A. Human remains. Their fragmentary condition renders the reconstruction of the corresponding skeletons almost impossible. No single skull remains intact. Judging by the fragments of lower jaws (mandible), at least twenty individuals are represented. Among these are youthful, middle-aged, and elderly persons of both sexes. The appearance of the fragments testifies generally to their great antiquity, and some of them look as if they had been almost completely incinerated. The work of reconstruction and assembly has yielded two calvariae and one cranial base, all measurable, besides fragmentary calvariae yielding no valuable evidence, together with various more or less fragmentary frontal, parietal, and occipital bones as well as mandibles. There are also several innominate (hip) and sacral bones, as well as limb bones (femur, tibia, carpus and radius) of various sizes. Notes are appended on the individual specimens. No. 2. (Mr. Pendlebury's A 4. 0o60-0o80). An incomplete calvaria, probably female. It is juvenile, and accordingly light, unmarked by prominences, and of moderate size.

I. 131 individual as the study of these mandibles shews, but also because this detail is not commonly observed in modern contemporary crania. The difference is attributable, as is natural, to the character of the diet, which would seem to have been principally vegetarian, contaminated with numerous mineral particles and supplemented with meat poorly cooked and requiring prolonged mastication. The remaining fragments call for no special remarks. No hard-and- fast conclusions emerge from the study of these remains. There is, however, a definite frequency of the cranial type termed, from the appearance it presents in norma verticalis, the dolichocephalic type. With this is associated the character called clinocephaly, consisting of a slight annular post-bregmatic compression of the cranial vault. Dolicho- cephaly is distinctive of the Mediterranean type, to which the ancient Cretan race belonged. The average index of the skulls examined by Duckworth and Hawes is 74.o, of those examined by Von Luschan (from the MM period circa I700 B.C.) is 74"8. A similar index characterises the skull No. 6 from Mallia (excavated by Dumarque). The facial characters as observed are not consistent with those of the cranium, but only one example is measurable, and in this the condition of the remaining bones renders the result unreliable. The upper facial index (48"09 denoting the euryprosopic 1 variety of face) differs from the average cited by Von Luschan (viz., 54"o denoting meso-prosopy 1). Again the nasal index 42"22 is leptorrhine, and herein differs from the average cited by Von Luschan (viz., 48"4, denoting mesorrhiny). B. The examination of the animal bones, carried out in the Zoological Museum of the University, revealed the presence of ox, goat, sheep (as lamb), an undetermined ruminant (probably cervus), dog, cat, and domestic fowl.
