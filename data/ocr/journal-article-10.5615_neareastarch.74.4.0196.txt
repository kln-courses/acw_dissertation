<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Peqi‘in Cave:  A Chalcolithic Cemetery  in Upper Galilee, Israel Zvi Gal, Dina Shalem, and Howard Smithline I t was a Saturday morning in May 1995 on the hillside of the Druze village of Peqi‘in, Upper Galilee, Israel (fig. 1). A bulldozer was cutting bedrock for the road  leading to the newly built youth hostel, when suddenly a  hole appeared in front of the shovel. The operator stopped  the machine and glanced into a dark cave, slowly exposed to  daylight after apparently having been sealed for thousands  of years. The scene revealed was reminiscent of an Indiana  Jones movie: a natural cave with magnificent colorful  stalagmites and stalactites in a variety of shapes with clear  water dripping everywhere on human skulls and bones, all  spread among hundreds of ancient burial containers, jars,  and bowls (figs. 2–4).  It took only a few minutes until several of the local villag- ers found their way into the cave, clambering back with clay- made boxes and believing they had been blessed with good  fortune. Among these people was someone who understood  the uniqueness of these objects and called Fahri Hason,  then District Inspector of the Israel Antiquities Authority  Figure 1.

Nevertheless, during  the Chalcolithic, the Galilee was sparsely populated compared  to the densely populated northern Negev, coastal plain, and  Golan Heights. If this premise is correct, the finds in the cave  show that this population, although living in small communi- ties in the Galilee, had strong commercial and cultural rela- tions with the communities in the Golan Heights, the Negev,  the Judean Desert, and probably other more remote areas and  populations. It may be that the cave was a sacred reinhumation  site for a widespread population. Another possibility is that the Peqi‘in cave was a central  burial site, indicated by the rich finds from several areas of  the cave, the large number of skeletons and burial containers,  and the unique iconographic depictions. If so, those buried in  the cave originated far beyond the small Galilean settlements  of the immediate region. Petrographic study shows that the  Golanite burial jars (see below) were probably produced in the  Golan Heights, so people from there were, it seems, brought to  be buried at Peqi‘in. The marked discrepancy between the number of individuals  (600–1,000) buried in the cave and the number of ossuaries  and burial jars excavated by us (about 200), should also be  taken into consideration. Although this discrepancy can be  explained as due to the recycling of the burial containers, we  should also consider the variety of burial fashions within the  Figure 18.

Who were the  deceased brought there to their final resting place? Why in  Upper Galilee, which is far from the known major regions of  Chalcolithic settlement?  For the first time, most of the regional Chalcolithic sub- cultures are found in a single defined context, from Gilat and  Beer-sheba in the Negev through the Judean Desert and north- ward by way of the Jordan Rift Valley to the Golan in the east  and the coastal plain in the west. Moreover, we would like to  put forward the existence of a heretofore-unknown Galilean  contribution to Chalcolithic regionalism that deserves further  study. The large quantity of bones (a minimum of 600 to 1,000  estimated individuals), ossuaries, and jars presents a number  of possibilities; indeed, no other known Chalcolithic burial  place contained so large a number of skeletons and burial  containers. One possibility is that the cave was in use for an  extended span of time within the Chalcolithic, as indicated  by a layer of crushed bones found below the ossuaries, hint- ing that the ossuaries were emptied and reused. If so, the cave  probably served the local inhabitants and functioned as a cen- tral burial site for a population that included several villages. Figure 19.

We suggest that these factors may reflect  social hierarchy: highly ranked individuals were buried in  iconographic ossuaries, others could afford an imported Gali- lean jar, and individuals of still lower social status were buried  in simply formed ossuaries or domestic jars or even as piles of  bones in natural niches, perhaps packed in a cloth. If so, we  further propose that those individuals buried in the Peqi‘in  cave were of higher social status among the members of the  Chalcolithic community/communities.  What Does the Iconography Symbolize? The outstanding innovation among the finds from the  Peqi‘in cave is the two- and three-dimensional painted and  sculpted human heads. This is the first time fully realistic  human features have been found on ossuaries, jars, and fenes- trated chalices, including not only a large applied nose and  eyes but also nostrils, ears, mouth, teeth, a beard, and arms— including hands and fingers. In addition, one group of ossuar- ies has small tails. Thus, the ossuaries and jars from Peqi‘in  can be divided into three main groups: female figures with  and without breasts; bearded male figures; and zoomorphic  images, recognized by their tails. It should be emphasized that  genitals were not depicted on any of the ossuaries and jars.  There were also more female presentations than male presen- tations. Undoubtedly, the female motif held a significant posi- tion in the rituals practiced in the cave. However, the question remains: What is the meaning of the Figure 20.
