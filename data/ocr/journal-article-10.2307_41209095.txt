ZAHL My first visit to the Amazon was in the late 1930's when Belém, traditional gateway to the mightiest of all river basins, was still in the pit of depression. Paint was peeling disreputably from the walls of the Hotel Grande, and the plaza was threatened by jungle which no one seemed energetic enough to cut back. Yet the years when rub- ber was king, and this languorous capital of the State of Pará awake and flourishing, are part of the record. Prodigious in its botanic profusion, the Amazon endemically nurtures a tree whose milky fluid pre-Columbians used for making balls that bounced - a re- markable substance that with the advent and growth of industrialism came to pro- vide a universal cushion for a world on wheels. This latex was there for the mere tapping - no new trees needing to be planted, no demanding horticulture prac- ticed, no labor unions surfeited. At the turn of the century the Amazon held a monopoly on the world market, and Manaus, field cen- ter of the industry a thousand miles upriver, raised on its shores along the Rio Negro an opera house as glittering and ornate as any in Milan or Paris. How the Amazon rubber barons, basking in their come-easy wealth and imported cul- ture, failed in 1876 to note Henry Wick- ham's shipment of Hevea braziliensis seeds to the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew; how they dozed while the resulting seedlings were quietly being dispatched to Ceylon, then throughout the East for planting, is a matter of history. Only when these Hevea О This is the third of PAUL ZAHL's reports for the Scholar. neophytes began to yield on a large scale and the resulting product to undersell the Brazilian equivalent, was Wickham's sleight of hand revealed. The Amazonian latex em- pire felt the shock wave of unexpected com- petition, and by 1915 its disintegration was complete. In 1939, the ink on my university sheep- skin barely dry, I ventured into this mold- ering world of rubber slump, seeking of all things ants. But it is not that visit, rather one eighteen years later, that now brings my pen to paper. By then the picture had changed rad- ically. The Hotel Grande was shipshape, the plaza well manicured, and conversation in the Grande's newly air-conditioned cock- tail lounge ranged from manganese opera- tions in Amapá, to a recently installed pe- troleum refinery at Manaus, and the wildly competitive search by a small army of for- eign technologists for oil, bauxite, iron and titanium. The Amazon, economically flat- tened at the time of my first visit, was obvi- ously in the throes of a profound resurgence - all of it, that is, save for one group of in- habitants whose ways were static. They had lured me once, were now doing so again. In umbrageous jungles flung beyond the town's human zone, I found my friends quietly carrying on exactly as before, generally unnoticed and, if seen, sedulously avoided. I was of course delighted, for Dino- ponera gigantea is of particular fascination not only because it is the world's largest ant but also because, as a member of the primitive Ponerinae, it represents an an- cient protophase in the social evolution of all ants. Division of labor is unknown with- in this ancestral form. More sophisticated 282</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR species, with their queens, workers, soldiers, slaves, fungus gardens, aphid "cows" and the like, bear about the same relation to Dinoponera as twentieth-century city dwell- ers do to Australian bushmen. It is likely that these ponerines would have interested the Spanish conquistador Francisco Orellana, who in 1541 discovered the River and purveyed the myth of lady warriors regnant there. For Dinoponera society consists preponderantly of females and is dominated by them, all identical and marvelously versatile - interchangeably hunters, fighters and defenders, egg produc- ers, nursemaids, police officers, excavators. The community is casteless, and has no rec- ognizable queen. A few dolefully fragile males are permitted existence by largesse of the sisterhood, but solely for the well-known purpose. Join me a few miles east of Belém where, machetes in hand and eyes alert for snakes, peccary and such, we enter a world pavil- ioned by a high layer of tree crowns stitched together with liana vines. Monkeys are up there, along with macaws, tou- cans and the rest of the equatorial zoo, but you neither see nor often hear them. The Neotropical rain forest is a deceptively peaceful place, and you wonder about all those Hollywood movies. That treetop sea tossing against the sky provides so diffusing a canopy that, except in clearings, little if any direct sunlight filters through, with the result that botanic life on the jungle floor, underlying a tangle of fallen trees and dead branches, and snowed upon ceaselessly by a sediment of leaves, tends to be meager and sallow. Humidity lingers near saturation; and the air, seldom moving, is never hot but always warm. Picking a narrow trail, with our eyes ever groundward so as to approve each next step, we are suddenly aware of a shiny jet-black thing moving on the leaf-littered path just ahead - the largest ant we have ever seen. Its bulky wasp-waisted body measures well over an inch, with gangling legs and a pair of sweeping antennae effectively doubling that length. This is one of the authentic Amazons which, along with a similar but slightly smaller ponerine, is locally referred to as the tocandira, also the "fever" and the "four-sting" ant, the latter alias bearing the formidable connotation that to be stung by a quartet is fatal. We only half believe this, and therefore freeze but do not draw back. Pinched between the monster's serrated mandibles is a bug of some sort, its legs still thrashing. Obviously the foray has been suc- cessful, and now with her prize secure the huntress is enroute back to colony head- quarters. We follow. I have said that ponerine ants are among the most primitive. Yet, compared to the majority of nonant insects, they are by no means inchoate, an inference based on the social scaling of insects by the degree of ma- ternal care given eggs and offspring. Grass- hoppers simply deposit their eggs in the ground and straightway forget them; a walk- ing-stick female sits on a forest twig calmly venting ova for willy-nilly distribution any- where below. These species patently have no postovulatory sensibility, and are as- signed summarily to the social basement. A little above them are such butterfly species as cement their eggs to the leaves of a specific plant whose tissues the hatchlings find tasty and nutritious. Recall the migrat- ing monarch female who flies hundreds of miles to find fresh milkweed and having laid her eggs thereon loses all further in- terest in their future. Considerably more advanced is the mud dauber wasp who pro- vides a paralyzed spider, the meat of which stays fresh until the egg has hatched and the larva is ready to dine; and the solitary bee who supplies each egg-containing brood cell with honey and pollen before sealing it shut. Some cockroaches, a bit higher in the Blue Book, tote their eggs postpartu- riently, so as to protect them until hatching is imminent. Among earwigs, the mother, having seen her eggs through hatching, ex- tends her solicitude for a time into the lives of the resulting nymphs. But all these species are still to be re- garded as subsocial. Only among ants, ter- mites and some wasps and bees is "true" social status achieved - that is, the mother and/or her helpers not only tend the eggs, feed the larvae and care for the cocoons, but remain with the offspring throughout life to 284</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR set up a family system often so rigidly regu- lated as to make any yet conceived by fascist man seem comparatively benign. By what euthenic and chemical persuasion the queen creates castes among her children-subjects is something every would-be despot should look into. But let us return to that black beauty on the jungle trail, hopeful she may lead us to her lair. She moves with urgent speed and, before we know it, veers off the path and vanishes into a jacks traw of rotting logs. We try to persuade an entrance to the log heap, but the job is beyond us. As the private eye's roper might report to his chief: "Con- tact made, subject elusive." But we are not discouraged; this, as of old, is still good hunting grounds for six-legged Amazons. Furthermore, the afternoon showers have begun and we must cut short the day's search. We hear their barrage on the forest canopy, but do not feel rain until we emerge from the forest to pick up our bicycles for the long pedal back to Belém. It seems fool- ish not to stay in the shelter of the forest, but we prefer a full soaking in the open to a half soaking in an ant-ridden jungle made suddenly dark by the sky's deep over- cast. A day or two later we are afield again, this time guided by José Lameira, a young aide from the Instituto Agronomico do Norte, a research and educational unit set up in Belém by the Brazilian Government to probe ways for increasing the productivity of what traditionally has been the Amazon Valley's skimpy agriculture. The prodigious character of the aim is matched only by the vastness of the area involved. Hundreds of thousands of those square miles of tropical luxuriance are underlain by soil of such high acidity as to render it hostile, even after successive clearing, to conventional farming. Crop varieties able to cope with acid soil must be found, or neutralizing fertilizers unstintingly used. The latter ex- pedient has so far proved uneconomic; the former still keeps plant hybridizers search- ing. Meanwhile the River flows on and the jungle continues to burgeon. José was no myrmecologist, but he was observant. He had told me that some dis- tance from the Institute, in the vicinity of a decaying jungle chapel, big black ants were often to be seen. Tocandiras? We'd have a look. A half hour on bicycles over increasingly rough and narrowing roadways delivered us to the edge of the jungle, then into a clear- ing where, just as José had described, stood a crumbling stone ruin, without roof or floor and overrun by the possessive tentacles of a gigantic climber. That these walls were of religious rather than secular origin was revealed by remnants of an elaborate altar and several niches still intact. A quick first examination of the area re- vealed no sign of ants. José seemed uncon- cerned, reacting with a wordy Latin shrug. Then, as an occasional huge raindrop fell and the daylight grew dim, we listened to another of those inevitable showers cre- scendoing across the jungle. Abruptly, as though fifty firemen hidden somewhere above were turning their hoses our way, it broke - warm, splashing, massive. We pressed close to one of the chapel walls, huddling there under our raincoats. The meteoric character of such tropical rain bursts is always exciting to me but in this instance, as the shower passed, the effect was robbed by the sight of a familiar black beast striding across the soaked ground al- most dead center of the nave. The ant approached a fist-sized hole in the earth and, as I stared, vanished into it. Then another followed. As a third appeared, I came to life and with a leap brought my dripping hat down over the monster. José, with a squeak of vindication, raced back to the bikes for our collecting gear. Cautiously I grasped the Dinoponera be- tween the tips of an extra-long chrome forceps. Legs strained and flailed as her mandibles gnashed at the cold metal; and from the pointed end of her huge segmented abdomen a stinger nearly a quarter of an inch long jabbed repeatedly in a furious effort to penetrate any target within range. With each jab a droplet of transparent fluid oozed from the fine tip. José was back handing me a collecting bottle, and the prize was ours. Traffic at the hole continued - arrivals S&gt;86</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR carried small beetles, caterpillars or spiders, indicating the species' carnivorous habit; departing ants were empty-mouthed. My forceps plucked continually until our catch numbered perhaps fifty, at which time ac- tivity around the hole tapered off, and I assumed we had taken most of the colony's citizens. Still alert for any incoming stragglers, we began to dig a yard-wide circular trench around the hole. Axe saw as much service as spade, for the earth here was interlaced by roots, some massive. We were hindered, too, by an occasional arriving huntress who, suddenly turned warrior, would drop her catch and rush at our shoes, obviously in angry search of vulnerable skin in which to deposit a deadly charge. She was, of course, summarily seized and bottled. Now and then an ant from below would partly emerge to investigate the commotion, only to pivot and disappear. Her responsibilities lay be- neath. Since the days of Solomon, men have de- scribed the ways of ants in anthropomorphic terms. While there are without question a number of provocative resemblances be- tween the societies of ants and men, the dif- ferences prevail. An ant society is little more than an isolated reproductive unit, most often built around a queenly egg-layer and her specialized mainly female offspring; that of man, on the other hand, comprises a coherence for the common good of mani- fold family groups whose members are, ex- cept for sex, morphologically similar. Ants have employed the materfamilias pattern for well in excess of thirty million years dur- ing at least the latter portion of which their mores have changed little, suggesting that the social potential has been exploited just about as fully as the ant's neurophysiologi- cal endowment will permit. The genus Homo, possessing a central nervous system immeasurably more complex than that of even the most advanced social insect, has experimented with societism for only a few hundred thousand years, and is still, obvi- ously, only in the nascency of its develop- ment. As for man's patent consciousness of self and his capacity for pure abstraction, we can no more securely deny that ants possess these in some degree than that ants are meaningfully aware of us. Our trench was about a foot deep when I began hesitantly to remove earth near the center of the diggings where the hole had by now collapsed. Abruptly twenty or more furious females flared up from the soil interstices, wildly agitated by this disturb- ance and the disclosure of several dozen inch-long cocoons shaped like miniature Idaho potatoes. Each grabbing up a cocoon in her mandibles, the angry ladies managed to move the precious bundles a few inches, only to drop them and tackle others. Our forceps bit repeatedly, and in short order the panicked Amazons, along with their cocoons, were our unharmed prisoners. An additional deep spade thrust revealed a cache of off-white larvae - pinhead- to pea- nut-sized grubs, helpless and squirming. Throughout the diggings there were no signs of elaborate mazes and galleries such as characterize the nests of most higher ants. The architecture here was simple, merely a tunnel and a couple of crude chambers, now with crumbling walls. In the debris I spotted dozens of whitish eggs stacked like cord- wood, each no longer than a caraway seed and about as thick as a straight pin. The rapidly diminishing number of incensed fe- males continued to seize eggs, larvae and cocoons, in a frenzy drop them, then repeat the action. Appearing amid the chaos were now sev- eral reddish-brown, wasp-like males only half the size of their sister-mates, bearing transparent wings and on each of their fore- heads a trio of conspicuous accessory eyes. I picked up one in my fingers, knowing that he possessed no weapons. The stinger and venom apparatus of ants are anatomical derivatives of an ancient obsolete egg de- positor, and for this reason are found only in the female. Fragility, helplessness and submission, even in this state of civic alarm, marked the behavior of these winged con- sorts. Soon in the solicitous jaws of their distinctly better halves, they were being carried off to a fancied safety. At last we had bottled virtually every in- dividual of the colony - eggs, larvae, co- coons, adults, all alive. And that night in my 288</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR temporary laboratory quarters at the Agro* nomical Institute, I kept vigil. By count, the she-ants numbered some ninety, evi- dence that a Dinoponera nest is moderately populated compared to the vast city-states of some Hymenopteran species. These I placed in two large screened cages provided with bottom layers of soft damp jungle soil. For a time the prisoners merely paced their cells or climbed aimlessly up and down the sides. But when I poured larvae and cocoons into one of the cages, activity there quick- ened. Ants seized immatures in their jaws, exhibiting the same rescue response ob- served earlier at the excavation site. From time to time, some of the females would release their burdens and patiently stand guard over them. Others nibbled at the soft skins of the larvae, conceivably as a cleans- ing action, but more probably to lick up edible exudates. Lids sat tightly on all my bottles and cages, but during a transfer at least one specimen must have made her escape, for suddenly crawling from the floor and up onto one of my bare sandaled feet was a lady bent on retribution. My swat came too late, as I felt her mandibles take hold, then the sharp entry of a viciously plunging hypodermic. Initially the pain was not intense, and I continued my observations. Later as my ankle began to throb, I examined the punc- ture and the ugly wheal developing around it, comforting myself with the reminder that these, after all, were four-sting ants. The chemistry of ponerine venom is ob- scure. I really had no way of knowing what to expect, although I visualized the toxic deposit seeping into my tissues, upsetting capillary permeability, blocking nerve syn- apses, disrupting the local neuromotor sys- tem. I did know, however, from an evolu- tionary viewpoint, that ponerine ants were derived from a wasp-like ancestor, and that therefore their venom probably bears some resemblance to that of contemporary wasps, which is far more virulent than most Hy- menopteran venoms, and the cause of re- corded fatalities, especially among victims somehow allergic to it. The active com- ponents of wasp venom are known to be histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, acetylcho- line, along with various proteins and en- zymes, for which likely counteractants are antihistamine and intravenous calcium lac- tate. Neither of these was available. I was hobbling now, as the pain rose through my calf and thigh, extending into the groin where lymph nodes were begin- ning to pulsate. The agony lasted about an hour and then rather rapidly abated. Soon all that was left was a glowering welt the size of a half-dollar on my ankle, and a finer regard on my part for Amazon weaponry. It was now close to three in the morning. In the cage to which I had added no larvae or cocoons, a number of ants had arranged themselves in a tight circle, like kittens around a bowl of milk. They were motion- less except for slight adjustments of their heads and mouthparts, their attention riv- eted on a central packet of some twenty glistening little eggs. Clearly these were freshly laid, and the sisters, one of whom had done the deed, had gathered no doubt to serve as nursemaids. Next day I returned to the excavation at the chapel ruins. Three single females crawled on the rubble heap. No doubt far afield at the time of the demolition, they had returned from foraging to find devasta- tion where once had been home. I did not molest them, and when I left they were still stalking as though unable to grasp the reality of their plight. But on the following day when I came back for a final look, no despairing pacers were there. Instead a fresh hole pierced the earth. The survivors were obviously below, hollowing a new chamber, perhaps preparing for the same sort of egg- laying party as had been so promptly or- ganized by their captive sisters. Recovery in the wake of calamity represents perhaps the greatest value of nonspecialization, for had these primitives been one-job members of a rigidly interdependent social structure, like the citizens of most higher ant societies, their doom would have been sealed. I draw no parallels regarding the human species. 290</page></plain_text>
