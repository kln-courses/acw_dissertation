<plain_text><page sequence="1">IF THE SWALLOW MADE THE PRINCE HAPPY: TRANSLATING WILDE INTO RUSSIAN Marina Rojavin, Bryn Mawr College According to Oscar Wilde, The Happy Prince- a, story about love, sacrifice, charity, banality, stupidity, and greed- is intended for children (2000, 350), and, at the same time, is destined "partly for those who have kept the child- like faculties of wonder and joy" (352). It indeed captivated the hearts and love of all people, regardless of age. Published in 1888 as part of The Happy Prince and Other Tales , it has been transformed into plays, films, a rock- opera, and animated films. The tale has been translated into many languages and, to paraphrase Michael Hardwick's words, it has taken on a new life of its own (76). While both folktales and literary fairy tales1 have hidden depths, literary tales "do not represent communal values but rather the values of a particular writer" (Zipes 1994, 15). The Happy Prince is no exception, as it surrepti- tiously delivers the author's covert messages and thoughts to the reader. Wilde's sexual life changed after his marriage in 1884- he was introduced to homosexual practices during the years he was working on the tales, namely 1887-1890 (Pearce 136-50). Wilde most likely reflected these changes in the story via the interpersonal relationships of the characters and, in particular, the gender choices. In his letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, known as De Pro- fundis , Wilde writes that many things which he has experienced are alluded to and "foreshadowed" in The Happy Prince (2000, 739-40). Perhaps this sentiment relates to the trio- the Swallow, the Reed, and the Prince. In the story, "the swallow and the prince are clearly male lovers" (Zipes 1990, 210) and although the swallow initially falls in love with the female reed, ulti- mately, the swallow and the Happy Prince fall in love with each other. Wilde could have made the swallow female, as in the myth about Philomela and Thanks to Sibelan Forrester for suggestions and support. My special gratitude to Gerald Janeček and anonymous SEEJ reviewers for their constructive comments and criticism. 1 . In this article, the term literary fairy tale designates a story that has an author, while a folk- tale does not (Propp 5-9).

As Wilde intentionally makes the swallow male in The Happy Prince , so does he intentionally make the nightingale female in The Nightin- gale and the Rose , despite the fact that the nightingale is male in the Persian legend on which the tale is based. According to the legend, the nightingale falls in love with the white rose and sings to it until he collapses on its thorns, staining it red with his blood (Seward 84). In Wilde's tale, the female nightin- gale has to sing to the Ae-rose-tree with her breast against a thorn to get a red rose for a student. The climax of the scene is a metaphor of sexual interaction which results in the birth of a red rose. The red rose is "a symbol of whole- ness" (Snider 9), of the passionate union of opposites- the male rose-tree and the female nightingale.3 Throughout The Nightingale and the Rose , Wilde emphasizes the duality of male and female- he Sun and she Moon, he Power and she Philosophy, and others, implying the same idea of wholeness. In The Happy Prince , Wilde uses the genre of a literary fairy tale "to illustrate through the imagination an alternative manner of behavior which can be re- alized in society" (Zipes 2002, 175). One such alternative manner of behav- ior is that of homosexuality, a main theme of the tale. Though a truism, different people perceive and react to the The Happy Prince , as to any fairy tale, differently. Adult readers respond deeply to a fairy tale according to their psyche, to archetypal images engraved in their mind (Snider 1). English-speaking people comprehend The Happy Prince based on their English-language consciousness. But a translator inevitably perceives the story in yet another fashion, thus resulting in the translated version acquir- ing new features and nuances in accordance with the consciousness and per- sonality of the translator, whose knowledge and skills are, in turn, founded on his/her language and culture. When reading Wilde's The Happy Prince and the two translations by Kor- nei Chukovsky and P. V. Sergeev and G. Nuzhdin, we come across figures who at first glance may appear the same but in fact differ in key ways. I argue that the choice of the names of the main characters and, consequently, the grammatical gender of the chosen names, shapes the plot development in the three works to create different situations, while the semantics of images asso- 2. According to Greek mythology, the swallow represents female revenge. Tereus, the hus- band of Procne, rapes her sister Philomela, after which he tears out her tongue to prevent her from revealing the crime. Undeterred, however, Philomela weaves a tapestry on which she de- picts what happened to her. In an act of vengeance, Procne kills the son she had with Tereus, boils him, and feeds their dead child to her husband. She then flees and transforms into a swal- low (Ovid Metamorphoses VI, 412-667). 3. In the Russian translation "CojiOBeii h po3a" by Mania Blagoveshchenskaia, where the nightingale cojioeeu is a male according to the masculine gender and the rose-tree translated po306biu Kycm [a rose bush] is masculine, the metaphor is missing for the reader (Wilde 1994).</page><page sequence="3">78 Slavic and East European Journal ciated with the chosen names affects the language and artistic images of the stories overall. In his translation of The Happy Prince , Chukovsky names the main char- acter the feminine jiacmonm [swallow], consequently eliminating the male romance essential for Wilde. Chukovsky became acquainted with the literary works of Wilde in the beginning of the twentieth century and expressed his interest regarding Wilde's persona, life, and works over many decades. He was aware of Wilde's nature (according to Chukovsky's words, a "feminine nature"). In From Anglo-American Notebooks , Chukovsky wrote that Wilde felt like a bride, wife, or mistress towards men, and that this is revealed in his books, because "in his works he was a typical modo vir , modo femina " ([1922] 2001, 7, 8). At that time in the Soviet Union, he could not and prob- ably did not want to highlight the untraditional relationship between the char- acters of The Happy Prince. At the same time, in his translation, Chukovsky reproduces Wilde's literary manner and his creative personality. Sergeev and Nuzhdin, who translated the story in the beginning of the twenty-first century and were not bound by the prejudice of society, unlike Chukovsky, go down a different path. They emphasize the homosexual theme by naming the main character the masculine CKeopeą [starling] and make gender the core aspect of the tale. However, their story does not convey the style and tone of the original and has different cultural connotations than The Happy Prince of Oscar Wilde. This article shows how word choice and the gender pattern in two Russian translations of The Happy Prince , by Chukovsky and by Sergeev and Nuzhdin, affect the semantics, the plot, and the stylistic environment of the story, evok- ing separate and distinct connotations and associations. The paper explores whether the translations are faithful to the original, what allusions they articu- late toward the image of the characters, and whether the tale is translated to be appropriate in the context of the receiving culture. Personification in Russian and English Potebnia shows that the semantic meanings of images in poetic language are grounded in personification, which, in turn, is based on the Russian gen- der classification of nouns. He asserts that the category of gender pertains to anthropomorphic categories that, in the process of personification,4 transfer attributes inherent in people to images (461). The grammatical forms of the nouns, i.e. their belonging to a specific grammatical gender, determine the formation of aesthetic perception and thought. The fact that the male and fe- male biological genders in Russian usually correlate with masculine and 4. Anthropomorphism and personification are parts of one trope; in this tale, endowing the plant, the bird, and the statue with human qualities pertains to anthropomorphism {Princeton Encyclopedia 612; Borev 38, 282); however, in the article the term 'personification' is used re- garding the swallow, the reed, and the statue of the Happy Prince.</page><page sequence="4">If the Swallow Made the Prince Happy: Translating Wilde into Russian 79 feminine formal genders respectively5 is the basis that allows inanimate nouns and nouns that denote birds and animals to acquire a quasi-gender and be personified.6 The semantics of gender forms predetermines the path of personification.7 In contrast to Russian, English does not have the formal grammatical cat- egory of gender. The English language does, nevertheless, have the corre- sponding semantic category of biological gender. Because of this lacuna, the semantic category in English is not expressed through morphology as in Russian- the language classifies objects, but not words, in accordance with whether they are animate or inanimate, with subsequent divisions into human / non-human. Consequently, personification in English is not linked with linguistic phenomena as in Russian, but rather with cultural, historical, and poetic traditions, as well as conventions. Metaphorization in belles- letters and the choice of quasi-gender and anaphoric pronouns depend prin- cipally on the consciousness of the authors and their attitudes and emotions regarding a referent (Baron 101-5; Curzan 21). 8 Word, Image, Plot The Swallow and the Reed Wilde opens the story with a description of "the statue of the Happy Prince" that stands on a tall column: "he was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold," which Chukovsky translates exactly the same way: "cTarya CnacTJiH- 5. For example, cecmpa [sister], mohoxuhr [nun] are feminine, 6pam [brother], mohox [monk] are masculine. 6. For example, in Russian fairy tales jweyuiKa [frog], Jiuca [fox], jicmna [lamp], 3anRmaR [comma] can only be female characters, while KpoKodwi [crocodile], Mypaeeü [ant], hüühuk [teapot] must be male characters. 7. That is what happened when Heinrich Heine's poem "Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam" was translated into Russian. Mikhail Lermontov interpreted Fichtenbaum as cocna [pine] in the poem "Ha eeßepe ahkom ctoht OAHHOKaa cocHa" [In the wild North stands a lonely pine], while oth- ers (such as Fyodor Tiutchev in "C h&gt;okoh CTOpOHbi" [On the Foreign Side], Apollon Maikov in "HHeeM chokhlim KaK PH30H noKpbiT" [Covered by Snow Frost as by Vestment], and Afanasy Fet in the poem "Ha ceBepe Reap oahhokhh" [In the North There is a Lonely Cedar Tree]) inter- preted it as Kedp [cedar]. The German Palme was translated by all four poets as najibMa [palm]. Shcherba stated that the noun Fichtenbaum was chosen purposely because the masculine gender created the image of unsatisfied male love with a woman, which was depicted by Heine as Palme. In contrast, Lermontov described a lonely soul cocua who was dreaming about a far-away soul najibMa. In his linguistic analysis, Shcherba showed that Lermontov's poem was beautiful, but absolutely an independent scenario that was very far from its original (Shcherba 98-109). 8. ror example, in her poetry, Emily Dickinson depicted Soul ( The Soul Selects Her Own Society") and Nature ("The Morning after Wo-") as females; Edgar A. Poe depicted Science , Fantasy and Night as female images, but Death , Hope and Love as males that correlate to the idea of power ("Tamerlane," "Sonnet to Science"), although Love may be female as is its god- dess Venus (Baron 102-3). However, in Russian, dyiua [soul], npupoda [nature], nayxa [sci- ence], (paHmo3UR [fantasy], HOHb [night], cMepmb [death], uadeotcda [hope], Jitoôoeb [love] are female because these nouns belong to the feminine grammatical gender.</page><page sequence="5">80 Slavic and East European Journal Boro npHHua [the statue of the Happy Prince]" and "npHHij 6biJi noKpbiT CBepxy ^OHH3y jiHCTOHKaMH HHCToro 30Ji0Ta [the Prince was covered from head to toe with small leaves of fine gold]." By contrast, Sergeev and Nuzhdin first avoid the word statue and write "cnacTJiHBbiH npHHu," [the happy prince] as if referring to a living being, and then "ero o/jeacaa 6biJia ciiiHTa h3 tohkhx jiHCTbeB caMoro Jiynmero 30Ji0Ta [his clothing was sewn from thin leaves of the best gold]." The phrase eeo odeotcda ôbijia ciuuma [his clothing was sewn] (Sergeev and Nuzhdin) can be used to refer to a man, while npumi 6bin noKpbim [the prince was covered] (Chukovsky) implies that the prince is a statue. He uses the feminine cmamyn although he in the original can refer to either the Happy Prince or the statue. On the other hand, Sergeev and Nuzhdin have a passer-by use the masculine naMxmHUK [monument] in a remark about the statue, which is less suitable here because what Wilde portrays is a statue, not a monument. Furthermore, they describe the prince as a living human, whereas naMRmnuK implies a dead person. Sergeev and Nuzhdin attempt to present a prince that is more alive, but end up compromising their efforts by utilizing naMRmHUK , while Chukovsky does not lend the gender much weight, instead opting for a translation as close to the original as possible. Wilde continues the story, depicting the relationship between the Swallow and the Reed. One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth. [...] So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. (10) The pronouns he and his inform the reader that the Swallow is a male char- acter, while the pronouns her and she , as well as the adjective beautiful , which is normally not used to describe a male, demonstrate that the Reed is female. So, it is established that the Swallow is in love with the Reed and wants to marry her, and therefore does not go with his friends to Egypt when the fall comes. Chukovsky translates the words swallow and reed literally: Jiacmonm and mpocmnuK respectively. KaK-TO HOHbK) npojieTajia tcm ropo^OM JlacTOHKa.

Once during the night, a Swallow was flying by way of the town. It was the seventh week since her friends had flown away to Egypt, while she lagged behind, because she was in love with a nimble beautiful Reed. She had spotted him back in early spring, while chasing a big yellow moth. [...] Then the Swallow began circling above him, at times leaving silvery ripples on the water in her wake.</page><page sequence="6">If the Swallow Made the Prince Happy: Translating Wilde into Russian 8 1 The situation with he-swallow and she-reed changes to the opposite in Russian: jiacmoHKa is a feminine noun and mpocmnuK is masculine, and therefore in Russian they personify female and male characters. The adjectives euÖKuü [nimble] and Kpacuebiů [beautiful] modify the noun mpocmnuK, while the short participle enwönena [was in love] and the verbs in the past tense npojiemana [was flying], cmajia [began] and ôbijia [was] modify the noun JiacmoHKa. Ad- ditionally, the noun nodpyeu [female friends], which lexically expresses be- longing to the female biological gender, pertains to the noun jiacmonm. Sergeev and Nuzhdin retain the same gender roles as in Wilde's story- the bird is a male, and the plant is a female. This is possible, because they name the bird Cneopeą and the plant TpocmuHKa , for the nouns belong to the mas- culine and feminine grammatical genders respectively.

Six weeks ago already, his friends had flown away to faraway Egypt, while he remained. The Starling was in love with a beauti- ful Reed. He met her in early spring, when he was flying down a river in pursuit of a yellow moth. [...] And the Starling began flying, flying around her, touching the river with his wings and covering the water with silver ripples. Despite the gender of the characters in the Russian translation and in Wilde's story being alike, the lexical environment changes. The meaning of the word mpocmuHKa is not fully mpocmnuK; it has two semantemes, cmeôejib [stem] and mpaeuHKa [blade of grass] and has the connotations moHKan [slim] or xydan [thin], rather than npeKpacnan 9 [gorgeous], which looks a bit exagger- ated in reference to mpocmuHKa- xopotueubKan [pretty] or cuMnamunnaH [cute] would fit better. Also, without going into ornithological details about swallows and starlings, especially about the places of their living and nest- ing,10 it is hard to imagine a starling flying down the river "touching the river with his wings and covering the water with silver ripples."11 Meanwhile, even with gender changes to the characters, Chukovsky employs a lexis that stylis- tically replicates the original. A third character then appears- the wind. Wilde writes: 9. Ozhegov and Shvedova is the basis for explanations of the meanings of the lexemes. 10. Unlike swallows, some starlings do not fly from North Germany, where the story takes place, in the winter. Also, some of them fly to Italy, Spain, or Greece, and not to Africa (Dashkova). 1 1 . This sentence is not good in terms of the style. If the two verbs Jiemamb [to fly] were split by the conjunction u [and], instead of a comma, the repetition would sound better. Conversely, the conjunction u before noKpbieamb [to cover] is not needed. Additionally, a mistake appears in the use of the word noKpbiean, which pertains to CKeopeif. Altogether, it means 'the starling was covering the water with ripples.'</page><page sequence="7">82 Slavic and East European Journal [...] he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. "She has no conversation," he said, "and I'm afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind." (10-1 1) Chukovsky tries to remain consistent in his translation and to follow Wilde's lexis, though it is not always possible. Although Wilde does not clarify to what quasi-gender the wind belongs, the story in Chukovsky's translation comes to a controversial situation when TpocmuuK may have an affair with Bemep [wind]. It seems that Chukovsky tries to find a way out of this situation. [...] JlacTOHKa nonyBCTBOBajia ce6a cnpoTOio, h 3Ta npHB«3aHHOCTb k TpocTHHKy noica3ajiacb eii oneHb tjhx)cthoh. - Eoace, Beai» oh KaK hcmoh, hh cjiOBa ot Hero He floõbembca, - roBopHJia c ynpeKOM JlacTOHKa, - h a 6oiocb, hto oh oneHb kokcdihb: 3aHrpbiBaeT c KaaqtbiM BeTepKOM. [...] The Swallow felt herself to be an orphan, and this affection for the Reed seemed to her very burdensome. "My God, it is as if he is mute; you can't get a word out of him," said the Swal- low with reproach, "and I fear that he is very coquettish, that he flirts with every passing wind." The two nouns lady-love and coquette lexically denote female persons. Chukovsky avoids the noun lady-love and replaces coquette [KoxeTKa] with the short adjective KOKemjiue (there is no masculine noun for KOKemm , and the short adjective KOKerruiue softens its feminine implication). Further, he translates flirting as 3auepbieaem. Although the verb to flirt can be translated as KOKemnunamb [to coquet], (ķjiupmoeamb [to flirt], and 3auapbieamb [to make advances], which are equivalent, each word may imply different nu- ances. 3auepbieamb may be considered as juo6e3Hunamb [to compliment], which is not the same as to flirt and diminishes the romantic connotations. Chukovsky cannot find anything other than eemep for [wind] (there is no feminine equivalent in Russian). However, he combines it with the pronoun motcdbiü [each] and uses the diminutive form eemepoK [small wind], which transforms the circumstances in the scene. Now it is not the wind eemep , it is Kaotcdbiü eemepoK [each small wind], which, in combination with the verb 3au2pbieamb, can be interpreted as if 'the Reed is flirting or playing with each small wind.' Although the translator uses the word KOKerruiue , which implies a situation with a romantic element, the phrase is rather tranquil in this regard when compared with Wilde's. On the other hand, in this small passage, Chukovsky focuses on the swallow's temper and annoyance, rather than on the bird's attitude toward the reed. Sergeev and Nuzhdin create a different situation: CKBopeu nonyBCTBOBaji ce6a o^hhokhm, h B03Jiio6neHHafl CTana noHeMHory HaAoe^aTb eMy.

"She does not even know how to speak," he noted. "She's probably a coquette- she constantly flirts with the wind." Here, the translators follow the English original and use the lexical equivalents for the nouns lady-love and coquette- eo3Juo6jieHHaH and KOKemm respec-</page><page sequence="8">If the Swallow Made the Prince Happy: Translating Wilde into Russian 83 tively, and for the verb is flirting- (pnupmy em. Sergeev and Nuzhdin repro- duce the scene lexically and semantically, replicating the same gender roles and showing the same romantic triangle as in the original. They deflate the style in this paragraph to a very neutral one,12 using everyday language, al- though on the whole the passage coincides with the tone of Wilde's Swallow. Although both stories look alike in the described scenes, the reader views different images and different personalities. While Chukovsky depicts a rather fickle and capricious female image, Sergeev and Nuzhdin portray a male character- less impulsive and more haughty and arrogant. The Swallow and the Happy Prince What happens to the Swallow later? He flies to the city with the intention of staying there overnight and sees the statue of the Happy Prince. There, the next part of the story unfolds. Wilde calls Happy Prince a statue in the begin- ning, then again when the Swallow "saw the statue on the tall column," and another time when the Prince tells the Swallow his story, in the author's words, "continued the statue." Chukovsky stays true to himself, and his trans- lation stays as close to the original as possible: "Tyr OHa [JlacTOHica] yBH^ejia CTaryio Ha bbicokoh kojiohhc [There she saw a statue on a tall column]" and then, "npoflOJiHcajia CTarya [continued the statue]." Did Chukovsky ignore those connotations and associations that the translated nouns brought to the story because of their belonging to a grammatical gender? Chukovsky- a highly gifted teller of fairy tales- knew what images arise when Russian nouns are personified. It is likely that he tried not to focus on the gender, to turn readers from this subject, possibly to confuse them. Therefore, he does not see a contradiction between the personified feminine cmamyx strength- ened by the feminine past tense form of the verb npodojiotcajia [continued] and the male Prince. In contrast, Sergeev and Nuzhdin translate those words as "Tyr oh yBH/jeji naMÄTHHK [He saw a monument]," and then, switching to the Prince, "cxa3aji npHHit [said the Prince]," using only masculine words. It seems, as aforemen- tioned, that the translators use nouns which differ from the original on purpose, because they consistently maintain the gender of the characters. At the same time, the gender dichotomy of Chukovsky 's statue-Prince shows a sort of equality of a statue and the Prince, diminishing the latter 's masculinity. After they get acquainted, the Prince tells the Swallow that he can see the misery and unhappiness of his city, at which point he asks the Swallow to stay with him for one night to be his messenger. When the Swallow is asked to take one ruby out of the Prince's sword-hilt and to bring it to the mother of a 12. The Russian linguist Shcherba divided the language into four stylistic levels: 'solemn, neutral, informal, and vulgar' (1957, 121). This classification is used to designate to which level words and expressions belong.</page><page sequence="9">84 Slavic and East European Journal sick boy, the bird says: "My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talk- ing to the large lotus-flowers" (13). Chukovsky again uses the feminine nodpyeu for friends and the masculine equivalent for lotus , Jiomoc : "Moh noflpyra Kpyacarcfl Ha^ Hhjiom h öeceayioT c nbiiiiHbiMH jiOTOcaMH. [My [girljfriends are circling above the Nile and are conversing with luxurious lo- tuses.]" Sergeev and Nuzhdin find a different word for flowers, the feminine noun jiwiuM [lily], to make a gender opposition to the male dpy3bH [friends]: "Moh flpy3bfl yace ^übho jieTaiOT h&amp;r Bcjihkhm Hhjiom. [...] TaM ohh öecejjyiOT c orpoMHbiMH öejibiMH jihjihjimh. [My friends have been flying over the Great Nile for a long time already. [...] There, they converse with enormous white lilies.]" Although the lotus and the lily belong to the same lily family and are often confused, the flowers have different symbolic mean- ings. In Ancient Egypt, the lotus flower became a symbol of the sun and recre- ation, while the lily meant purity and virtue for Greeks (Skinner 151, 160). The translators diverge in their paths: Chukovsky utilizes Wilde's word choice. The reason why Sergeev and Nuzhdin employ the lily, despite the fact that the lotus is strongly associated with Egypt, may be that they constantly retain their gender opposition, even though in this case they can harmlessly use the noun Jiomoc as well. In the next scene, the Swallow demonstrates his high spirit and flies around the city. "Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, 'What a distinguished stranger!' so he enjoyed himself very much" (15). The translators show the same approach to their interpretations as before. Chukov- sky renders the phrase the following way: Kyaa 6bi OHa He aBJWJiacb, BopoõbH npHHHMajiHCb HHpHKaTb: "Uto 3a nyacaic! Hto 3a Hy^Kaic!" - H 3BaJlH ee 3HaTHOH HHOCTpaHKOH, HTO ÖbIJIO AJIfl Hee Hpe3BbIHařÍHO JieCTHO. Wherever she appeared, the sparrows took to chirping, "What a stranger! What a stranger!" and called her a distinguished foreign lady, wh;ch was exceptionally flattering for her. Again, Chukovsky does not see a problem with naming a female character the masculine nyotcaK13 [stranger]. More important for him is using this word to imitate the sparrows' sounds by repeating the same consonant combinations (h [ch], 3 [z], h [eh], 7K [zh], K [k]) and by keeping the rhythm huk-hupúk! HUK-HupÚKÍ [chik-chirik! chik-chirik!]- the sound produced by sparrows in Russian. Thus he slightly changes Wilde's words and applies two meanings of the noun stranger- uyotcaK [alien] and unoempanm [foreigner] - for his scenario requires such word play. Conversely, Sergeev and Nuzhdin choose another word for the noun stranger- cmpauHUK [wanderer], which, when combined with the adjective 13. The masculine noun nyjtcaK does not have a feminine equivalent and is usually not used when addressing female persons, as opposed to the masculine nouns epcm [a doctor, physician], npo(peccop [professor] and others, which are used also for women.</page><page sequence="10">If the Swallow Made the Prince Happy: Translating Wilde into Russian 85 3a2adoHHbiü [mysterious], feels more romantic, but it also seems removed further than necessary from Wilde's original.

Wherever he appeared, the sparrows started twittering: "Who is this mysterious wanderer?" they asked each other. The Starling remained very pleased with himself. They maintain the same calm neutral tone as before, and the verb iąe6emamb [to twitter] fits the style of this part, except that the verb most likely pertains to swallows whereas nupummb [to chirp] would go better with sparrows {NatsionaVnyi korpus rus s kogo iazyka ).14 The Swallow stays with the Happy Prince another night, for the Prince asks him to take a rare sapphire from his eye and bring it to a poor young man who has to finish a play. But the Swallow refuses to do so and starts crying. "'Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,' said the Prince, 'do as I command you'" (16). Chukovsky's prince says: "JlacTOHKa, jiacTOHKa, MajieHbKaa jiacTOHKa! HcnojiHH bojiio moio! ['Swallow, swallow, little swallow! Carry out my will!']." Meanwhile, Sergeev and Nuzhdin's prince uses these words: "MajieHbKHH, MajieHbKHH ckbophohok,- npoMOJiBHJi npHHit, - c/te ji au, icaK h BejiK) ['Little, little starling chick,' uttered the prince. 'Do what I tell you']." The authors of both translations stay true to the original and articulate the fondness expressed by the Prince toward the Swallow. It is easy to do so in the case of jiacmoHKa because of the diminutive -ohk- that implies 'tiny, small' and gives the word the additional nuance of tenderness stressed (as in the original) by the adjective McuieubKan [small]. It is also worth noting that the noun jiacmoum is used in reference to women and children expressing warmth and fondness. Sergeev and Nuzhdin use cKeopnonoK to show the same emotions, but the result is different, because the noun indicates nestling and invokes different emotions and a different picture than JiacmoHKa . So the Happy Prince asks the Swallow to stay with him one night and then another in order to take, one by one, the great ruby from his sword and rare sapphires from his eyes, and to give the stones and the gold leaves with which he is covered to those in the city who need them most. The relationship be- tween the Happy Prince and the Swallow gradually changes. If, in the begin- ning, the Swallow does just a favor and stays with the Prince for one night to be his messenger, later he cannot leave the Prince, because he becomes respon- sible for him. This responsibility is augmented especially when the Prince turns blind, in addition to another, possibly more important, reason; the Swal- low knows that he will die if he stays with the Prince, since the winter is ap- proaching. The Prince realizes it too, and he demands that the Swallow fly 14. Also, the imperfective nonejinjicn [appeared repeatedly] is better for this sentence than its perfective counterpart nonewicH [appeared once], because, to ameliorate the style in this sen- tence, all verbs should be imperfective.</page><page sequence="11">86 Slavic and East European Journal away, although he knows that he would be alone and no one would need him, because he would no longer be happy. However, the Swallow refuses to fly away, and Wilde makes the reason explicit: "The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well" (20). Wilde omits a conjunction between the second and the third clauses. Consequently, the third clause is a parenthetical phrase, which syntactically conveys supplemental information and, more importantly, makes the empha- sis fall on this phrase. It seems that Chukovsky translates this sentence ver- batim: "JIacTOHKa, öeflHaa, 3HÖJia h Mep3Jia, ho OHa He xoTeiia noKHHyn» ripHHiļa, Ta K KaK oneHb jnoÖHJia ero [The Swallow, poor thing, trembled from the cold and froze, but she did not want to leave the Prince, because she loved him very much]." Nonetheless, he builds the sentence in such a way that the attribute óednan [poor], placed after the modifying noun, is detached, and this part is separated by the intonation, although stylistically, öednan jiacmomca would sound better, as this combination would express feelings instead of just exposition as with the detached attribute. Other than this, Chukovsky dimin- ishes the emphasis put on the last three words by employing the conjunction max kūk [given that]. By leaving out the last part of the sentence Sergeev and Nuzhdin partly ob- scure the homoerotic theme which otherwise their translation strives to bring out: "MajieHbKHił CKBopeu, Bee öojibme h öojibme 3aMep3aji [The little star- ling froze more and more]." At last, we come to the climax of the relationship between the Swallow and the Prince when the Swallow "knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more." "Good-bye, dear Prince!" he murmured, "will you let me kiss your hand?" "I'm glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow," said the Prince [...] "but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you." "It is not to Egypt that I am going," said the Swallow. "I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?" And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down at his feet. (20) Chukovsky translates this powerful dialog in a solemn style with a moving tone, carefully selecting the words and word order, which mirror the same emotions, but not the situation that Wilde invokes in his story. - npomaň, MHJibiH npHHu! - npomenTajia OHa.- Tbi no3BOJiHiub MHe nouejiOBarb tboio pyicy? - ü pafl, HTO Tbl HaKOHeu yjieTaeuib b ErnneT, - otbcthji CuacTJiHBbiH npHHu.

"I'm glad that you are finally flying away to Egypt," answered the Happy Prince [...] "But you must kiss me on the lips, because I love you."</page><page sequence="12">If the Swallow Made the Prince Happy: Translating Wilde into Russian 87 "Not to Egypt I'm flying," answered the Swallow. "I am flying away to the Asylum of Death. Are not Death and Sleep brothers?" And she kissed the Happy Prince on the lips and fell dead at his feet. One sentence belongs to a different, neutral, style compared to the elevated style of the whole paragraph: " Ho mbi dojijtcna notļejioeamb Mem e eyôbi, nomoMy umo h jhoõjho meôn" The demanding, but at the same time straight- forward, request expressed by dojiotcna [must] simplifies the situation. The neutral conjunction nomoMy umo [because] indicates clarification and expla- nation of the request, which is contained in the main clause, but is irrelevant in a declaration of love. Aside from that, the use of the noun yema [lips], in- stead of eyôbi [lips], in the last sentence, which relates to the high style and sounds bookish, makes the relationships sublime and platonie rather than af- fectionate and loving. This marks another time when Chukovsky follows the original stylistically, while narrating a different story thematically. Con- versely, he ignores the fact that cMepmb [death] is a feminine noun, and in Russian consciousness, it is associated with a female image and should be cecmpa [sister]. Here, however, it actually matters that CMepmb [Death] and Coh [Sleep] are õpambH [brothers] in correspondence to the Greek myth that Death and Sleep are brothers ("Legendy i skazaniia" 16). What Sergeev and Nuzhdin show is different with regard to the style and meaning: - IIpomaHTe, Aoporoň npHHu! - BbiroBOpHJi oh. - Pa3peiiiHTe mhc nouejiOBan» Barny pyicy.

"Little Starling, I'm glad that you will finally be in Egypt," said the Prince [...] "But you need to kiss me on the lips, since I love you." "But I am not departing for Egypt," said the Starling. "I am departing to the Castle of Death. Death is Sleep's sister, true?" He kissed the Happy Prince on the lips and dropped on his shoes. In contradiction to Chukovsky 's translation, other nuances can be found in the words: " Ho meõe nado noąejioeamb Mem e eyõbi, eedb h jhoôjoo meÔH ." The impersonal structure of the main clause, which includes the auxiliary nado [need] belongs to the neutral style with focus on the main verb notfejioeamb [to kiss]. The conjunction eedb [for], which pertains to the solemn style, emphasizes the feeling of the Prince and expresses the specific relationships between the two characters. Most likely, they allude to the love 15. It is not clear why only in this episode the starling addresses the Prince with polite forms, using Bbi [you] instead of informal mu [you], npoiyaůme [farewell] instead of npouļau. , pa3peiuume [allow], not pa3peuiu , and Baiuy [your] rather than informal meoio [your].</page><page sequence="13">88 Slavic and East European Journal affair. However, the combination of meõe nado [...] and eedb [...] do not match stylistically and do not induce an apt sentiment. The noun CMepmb [death] acquires a female quasi-gender as per the grammatical feminine gen- der, and it turns into cecmpa [sister], which does not destroy the content, but estranges it from certain allusions. Finally, the last words in this excerpt " yncui na eeo mytpnu [fell on his shoes]" do not seem poetic and do not lead to any allusions, whereas Wilde's fell down at his feet is poetic and can guide readers to various allusions, i.e. love and worship, and can also be associated with the Bible, Revelation 19:10, "/ fell at his feet to worship him ." At the same time, Chukovsky's words "yncuia Mepmean k eeo noeoM [fell dead at his feet]" convey the same tone, feeling, and mood as in Wilde's tale and can refer to the same allusion. Thus, the development of the relationship between the Prince and the Swal- low in the two translations brings to mind different pictures and evokes dif- ferent feelings. Sergeev and Nuzhdin show a romantic relationship as in the original, focusing on the loving bond between males. However, their por- trayal of these scenes is not as powerful as Chukovsky's because of the lexi- cal and stylistic milieu. Chukovsky, on the other hand, focuses on the spiri- tual values and replicates the artistic tone of the original. Concluding Thoughts As stated above, the content and plot of poetic works are stipulated by se- mantics and connotations that the gender forms evoke, which, in turn, influ- ence the choice of lexis. This is the case of the sign-text dichotomy accord- ing to Gin: the sign as a name of the character which develops into the text (explication), and text as a plot structure which condenses into the sign (im- plication) (Gin 61). The names of the characters in both translations (&lt; cmamyn , JlacmoHKa , TpocmuuK , Bemep ( eemepoK ), nodpyeu, Jiomoc, CMepmb u Con - ôpambH (Chukovsky)- noMHmnuK, Cneopetf , Tpocmunm , Bemep , dpy3bn , CMepmb- cecmpa Cna (Sergeev and Nuzhdin)) and, consequently, their gen- der, lead to dissimilar plots, and the semantics of the names impacts the choice of a different lexis, which leads the reader to different allusions. Many associations connected with the image of the swallow can arise: the swallow as a herald of death and a symbol of spring and resurrection, the swallow as one of the animal totems of Aphrodite and as a symbol of female revenge in Greek mythology (Hall 48). In Russian culture, as well as in oth- ers, the swallow is perceived as a symbol of the soul (Hall 48; Surat 1). This aspect is important in the discussion about the Russian reader, given the fact that the theme of a soul is central in the Russian culture.16 The swallow is 16. Many Russian poets devoted poems to the swallow (Gavrila Derzhavin "JlacTOHKa" [Swallow], Apollon Maikov "JlacTOHKH" [Swallows], Afanasii Fet "JIacTOHKH" [Swallows], Osip Mandelstam "JlacTOHKa" [Swallow], and others).</page><page sequence="14">If the Swallow Made the Prince Happy: Translating Wilde into Russian 89 also a symbol of immortality (Epshtein, "Derzhavin Gavriil Romanovich") or of the death of loved ones (Egorova 2). Albeit Jiacmonm is viewed as a messenger of spring, the cneopeiļ is also strongly associated with spring, which is expressed in poetry (e.g. the poem by Nikolai Zabolotsky "YcTynH MHe, CKBopeu, yrojiOK" [Give up your perch to me, starling], 1946) and art (e.g. a painting by A.M. Gerasimov "flecHH CKBopua" [The Song of a Star- ling], 1938). If the noun jiacmonm appeals to compassion, cneopeą brings a different emotion since it appears in Russian culture mainly as a singer- imitator with positive or negative implications (e.g. in two fables by Ivan Kry lov, "CicBopeu" [The Starling ] and "Kotchok h CKBopeu" [The Kitten and the Starling]). In his translation, Chukovsky names the main characters as in the original. He presents a different picture in terms of gender roles, however, and elimi- nates Eros and the theme of homosexuality. He tells the reader, primarily a young reader, a story, at least one of subplots, about a capricious female char- acter JJacmoHKa , which parts with TpocmnuK , her male lover, for the latter does not show much admiration for her. JlacmoHKa becomes a better person because of good actions, and because the friendship and platonie love with the Prince make her better, or rather, change her completely. Chukovsky carefully chooses words and plays with styles (e.g. in the monologue of Jiacmonm about TpocmnuK and eemepoK ), moving the subplot in the direction of his choosing and intentionally ignoring the gender when he thinks it is necessary (e.g. referring to Jiacmonm as the masculine nyołcaK [stranger], or to the fem- inine CMepmb [Death] as the masculine 6pam [brother]). It is not about the same love and not the same trio as in the original. Chukovsky's trio implies another situation and evokes other feelings, yet reproduces the literary manner and style of Wilde and the poetic melody of the tale. Sergeev and Nuzhdin select cmopeiļ for the character, intending to con- struct the same scenario as in the original. Conversely, this guides them to dif- ferent scenery. It does not evoke the same emotions as the original, first of all because of the name of the bird. They retain the same gender pattern as in the original, emphasizing the homosexual relationship between Cmopeiļ and ĪIpuHtļ. Although it seems that this leads them to the same set-up in the rela- tionship between the trio Tpocmunm , Cneopeą, Ilpunij as between the Reed, Swallow, and the Prince, their story is not as powerful. The translators main- tain gender as a key factor in the story, but sacrifice the tone and allusions of the original because of the word choice (e.g. feminine mpocmunm to pair with CKeopeą , naMnmnuK to match with npuną, jiujiuu to oppose dpy3bx). The informal style does not fit the situation in some scenes (e.g. the last sentence in the last dialogue between Cmopeą and Tlpuną ), and the unnecessary omis- sion of essential words, such as those that reveal that the bird loved the Prince, reduces the intensity of the feelings between Cmopeą and Tlpuną. On the surface they represent the same plot as in the original, but on the whole,</page><page sequence="15">90 Slavic and East European Journal they fail to reproduce the author's spirit, and the Russian reader does not re- ceive a tale equal to the original in allusion and sentiment. The repercussions of word choice and the semantics of nouns with quasi- gender are evident in the translations by Chukovsky and by Sergeev and Nuzhdin of Wilde's The Happy Prince. For Chukovsky, an artistic translation has "to reproduce not only the original author's ideas and images and plot schemes, but also the author's literary manner and creative personality" [1919] (1984, 18). Although the important aspect of homosexual love is hidden, the Russian reader receives a tale which preserves Wilde's beauty of language and the poetic melody of the tale. By making the bird female and retaining the fairy-tale atmosphere, as well as the linguistic richness, Chukovsky makes this story primarily designed for children. Sergeev and Nuzhdin conversely main- tain the same gender roles as in the original, but sacrifice the symbolism asso- ciated with the swallow, and their translation strategy leads to an undesirable result, since they seem to lack a real feel for the original. The translators go down different paths, and the reader receives one tale full of Wilde's spirit and art and another that lacks the same beauty and emotional power. REFERENCES Baron, D.
