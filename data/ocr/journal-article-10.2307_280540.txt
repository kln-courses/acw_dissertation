(This emblem glyph is certainly not the well-known Naranjo emblem iden- tified by Berlin [Journal de la Societe des America- nistes, n.s. XLVII: 111-119, 1958]; if it refers neither to Caracol nor Naranjo, it would seem likely that it refers to another site in the vicinity of those two cen- ters.) Beetz also calls attention to another glyph that, while definitely not an emblem glyph, seems to behave like one. He designates this the "Caracol Glyph," as it seems to be associated with Caracol rulers; it may ul- timately prove to be a title or have some related mean- ing. There are a few additions or corrections that would have made this an even more useful book. (1) A map showing the location of Caracol (and other sites men- tioned in the text) would have been helpful. (2) Intersite relationships and the co-occurrence of similar clauses at different sites (e.g., the ox-compounds at Caracol, Tikal, and Naranjo) could have been discussed at great- er length, and the clauses from other sites could have been illustrated. (3) Some editorial errors involving glyph-block designations should have been caught. For example, on page 119 references to Stela 6 glyphs at El 3, F15, and D 16 in Figure 7 are incorrect; the page 119 text should refer to B 13, C 15, and A 16, respec- tively. There are similar errors on pages 121-122. On the whole, however, the volume constitutes an excellent record of the Caracol inscriptions. Future epigraphers will appreciate the photographs and the careful line drawings of the texts, while today's scholars will welcome the dynastic reconstructions offered by Beetz. Although we still know very little archaeologi- cally about the site of Caracol, this publication of its known inscriptions should inspire some investigator to design a project integrating excavation strategy, epi- graphic results, and a regional settlement pattern sur- vey. On the Edge of the Sea. Mural Painting at Tancah- Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico. ARTHUR G. MILLER. Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University, Washington, D.C., 1982. xiv + 133 pp., illus., biblio., index, appendices. $35.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Clemency Coggins, Peabody Museum, Harvard University. The title, On the Edge of the Sea, expresses Arthur Miller's key point in this study, that a peripheral, even frontier, location on the east coast of the Yucatan pen- insula dictated the course of history and the religious symbolism found in paintings at Tancah and Tulum. On this eastern shore of Mesoamerica the rise of the Sun and of Venus were interpreted as rebirth from the underworld, as the passage across a threshold, or limen. Because of this metaphor, and for topographic reasons, he analyzes the psychological history of Tancah-Tulum in terms of liminality. Historically, Miller postulates a sequence of entradas by foreign groups, of which three pertain directly to the stylistic sequence of the local mural painting: (1) ca. A.D. 770; (2) ca. A.D. 1440; and (3) a sixteenth-century Spanish colonial occupa- tion. This book is divided into six chapters, with three appendices, one on the Tancah ceramic sequence by Joseph W. Ball, one on the human skeletal remains by Frank P. Saul, and one on archaeological mollusca by Anthony P. Andrews. The illustrations are abundant, with 145 figures that include black-and-white photo- graphs, maps, plans, and line drawings, with an ad- ditional 47 color plates at the end. In Chapter I, Miller discusses geographical setting and notes previous research. It is too bad that he did not include a 1976 article, published in Mexico, by Martine Fettweiss on the paintings at Tancah, Xelha, and Coba (Algunos sitios con pintura mural en Quin- tana Roo, Cuadernos de los Centros, #27), since she comes to many of the same conclusions. In Chapter II, Miller describes excavations he di- rected in the Structure 44 complex at Tancah. These confirmed the Late Preclassic occupation found by Sanders (Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publi- cation 606, Contribution 60, 1960), and dated the ear- liest masonry construction in this complex to Terminal Preclassic. Ceramic vessels found in ten burials ex- panded this sequence into the Early Postclassic. Eighty operations were carried out here, but "to avoid unfo- cused listing of data" (p. 15) there is little presentation of this work. The 13 sections of exploratory trenches and of burials are, with one exception, not keyed to the plan of the group and so cannot be located. Miller emphasizes that the purpose of the excava- tions was to find ceramics to date the murals in Struc- ture 44; however, he disputes Ball's eleventh-century date for construction, which is based on ceramics from the fill of Structure 44-1st (pp. 109-110), in favor of his own mid-fourteenth-century estimate of the date of the extant paintings, which resemble one of the styles in the later Postclassic Madrid Codex (p. 54). The most obvious way out of this dilemma lies in postulating two or three centuries in which the building was built but not yet painted; in fact Ball suggests the site was abandoned between A.D. 1050 and 1200. Adoption of the 11.3.0.0.0 correlation (256 years later) of the Chris- tian and Maya calendars offers another possible solu- tion. Excavations were also carried out in Structure 71, an early Colonial Spanish chapel with associated bur- ials which suggested some continuity in burial customs from Prehispanic times, and provided Saul, in Appen- dix II, with an opportunity to examine bones for spe- cifically European-related disease and dietary changes. Chapter III presents the development of the mural tradition at the neighboring sites of Tancah and Tulum, and at Xelha, immediately to the north. The paintings are scattered and their preservation poor, so that while the postulated relative sequence is sound, it is difficult to date any part of it. Miller identifies the earliest, and the latest, paintings in the sequence at Xelha. The ear- liest are on the inner wall of a vaulted room in Structure 26-sub (Plates 42, 43). Here red and yellow birds fly over mounds in two square red-bordered panels on a white ground; these flank a glyphic panel that begins with a day sign. This wall is best illustrated in Fettweiss (1976: Figure 10). A problem with the chronology that Miller has de- vised is that the earliest period, Terminal Classic/Early 207</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Postclassic, extends from A.D. 770 to 1200, an un- manageably long time, and it is never stated how the beginning and ending dates were determined. Miller assigns a painted diving jaguar" (Plates 44, 45) in Xelha Structure A to this early catch-all period (p. 51), while the latest painting in the sequence, also from Structure A, is described as early Colonial (Plates 46, 47). The latter is, according to Miller, on stucco layer no. 26 (out of 27), whereas the diving jaguar is on another wall on layer no. 7 (p. 56). Although he describes Struc- ture A architecturally as "typical Late Postclassic," the inner room with the paintings may actually represent an earlier phase of construction (p. 43, footnote 18). The painting that exemplifies the earliest period is in Structure 12 at Tancah (Plates 6, 7). This large al- legorical scene features four blue anthropomorphic beings, of which three wield axes and have long-nose heads; these figures converge on a seated personifica- tion of corn. Several ceramic vessels depicted in this scene correspond to types found in the fill of Structure 44-1st (p. 110) which, on the basis of its mural, Miller would date at A.D. 1350 (p. 54) and Ball as eleventh century (p. 110). Miller and Fettweiss both note some stylistic simi- larities between the painting in Tancah Structure 12 and those in the earlier part of Structure 1 at Tulum. On this basis Miller assigns Tulum Structure 1-sub to his earliest period, before A.D. 1200. However, Sand- ers's extensive testpitting established Tulum as a sin- gle-component site, occupied for approximately two centuries before the Conquest (1960, p. 188). While Structure 1-sub might date from the thirteenth century it is unlikely to be earlier. Next in the sequence are the paintings in Structure 44 at Tancah that closely resem- ble two in the Codex Madrid, dated A.D. 1350, in the Middle Postclassic. The final style, after A.D. 1400, found in Structures 5 and 16 at Tulum, was brought by an outside group that Miller identifies as "Putun- Nahua" (p. 74) who carried Mixtec style and ico- nography. Chapter IV postulates a series of entradas on the coast, and the continuous possibility of piratical raids, symbolized by the axe-wielding Chacs in the Structure 12 painting, who may be understood as the warrior- merchants whose presence and absence characterized the episodic history of the region. This chapter closes with a valuable ethnohistoric summary of the Colonial period, partly written by Nancy M. Farris. The final chapter returns to the murals and to what Miller calls the iconology of Tancah-Tulum; by this he means their "intrinsic meaning" or their "cultural im- plications," as opposed to their iconography, which would refer to an analysis of the apparent symbolic program. While numerous references are made to the iconography, the visible content of the paintings is nev- er systematically described, so it is not always possible to understand how Miller perceives them, and to follow his argument. At the end he expands on the themes of rebirth, as symbolized by Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan, Ve- nus, and Sun imagery. These are convincingly present in the Cenote at Tancah where Ahau and Lamat glyphs are carved in the rockface (Figures 118-20). The Ixchel (female goddess) birth symbolism of Cozumel is also related to what Miller interprets as umbilical cord im- agery in the murals. This book presents a wealth of information and hy- potheses to consider. Even when one does not accept all of the author's arguments it is possible to reconsider the evidence available in the appendices, and in the numerous fine illustrations which include copies of the murals by Kees Grootenboer and Felipe Davalos. Air Photo Interpretation for Archaeologists. D. R. WIL- SON. St. Martin's Press, New York, 1982. 212 pp., illus., biblio., glossary, index. $29.95 (cloth). Reviewed by James I. Ebert, University of New Mexico. At first glance, American archaeologists examining D. R. Wilson's book may be tempted to dismiss it as irrelevant, and feel that it might more aptly have been titled "Air Photo Interpretation for the English Ar- chaeologist." Skimming through its pages, one is con- fronted with a bewildering array of spectacular pho- tographs of henges, causewayed enclosures, long, round and square barrows, Roman military fortlets and villas, and cursuses. While obviously oriented toward the En- glish archaeologist, the book, however, deserves more than cursory attention here in the United States as well. First, on a superficial level, it contains more than one hundred superb aerial photographs of the sorts of ar- chaeological remains that must be seen from the air to be appreciated: the graceful, curving walls of Iron-Age hillforts, complex palimpsest patterns of Medieval field furrows and boundaries, and huge Bronze Age round- barrow cemeteries. More importantly, though, the vol- ume has a number of lessons to teach American ar- chaeologists-not all of which were probably envi- sioned by the author. David R. Wilson is Chief Curator of the University of Cambridge's Committee for Aerial Photography, an organization responsible for much of the impetus be- hind the meticulous and systematic work that char- acterizes British "aerial archaeology." As such, he is in an ideal position to bring years of practical experi- ence to bear on an exhaustive discussion of some of the ways that aerial photographs can aid the archae- ologist in discovering, interpreting, and conserving pre- historic and historic sites. Particularly useful is the fact that Wilson devotes nearly as much space to enumer- ating and illustrating natural and recent cultural phe- nomena that might be mistaken for archaeological re- mains as he does on the interpretation of actual sites. His discussion of the agencies responsible for the vis- ibility of archaeological remains from the air-shadow, crop and soil marks for the most part-is the most complete available in the literature of aerial archae- ology, and each assertion he makes is illustrated with appropriate as well as intriguing aerial photographs. Unlike many British and European aerial archaeolo- gists, Wilson emphasizes that conclusions made on the basis of aerial photointerpretation must be field-checked on the ground, and that the questions of what one sees in an aerial photograph and what it means should be explicitly separated in the archaeologist's mind.
