<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Copan-style stone sculptures in museums of Guatemala GRAZ (Karl Herbert Mayer). The large ancient Maya city of Copan in Honduras is famous for its wealth of splendid masonry architecture and contains an unsurpassed number of freestanding monuments and architectural stone sculptures (Maudslay 1898-1902; Robicsek 1972; Baudez 1994). Since 1985 the Copan Mosaics Project, directed by Barbara W. Fash and William L. Fash, focusing on sculpture facades of Copan, has added an enormous number of sculptures to the formerly known corpus (cf. W. Fash 1989; B. Fash 1992; Andrews Vand Fash 1992). The sheer quantity of carved stones and sculp tures is exemplified on Copan Structure 22, where about 4,000 pieces of stone sculptures belonging to this single building were ascribed (Ahlfeldt 2004, p. 48). Moreover, the corpus of hieroglyphic inscriptions is essentially larger compared with any other Maya city or site (Morley 1920; Fash 1991). Although the overwhelming majority of stelae, altars, door jambs, and architectural sculptures are still in situ, since the beginning of archaeological work and excavations at Copan, a substantial portion of sculptures were taken, legally and illegally, from the ruins and entered public and private collec tions in Honduras, but many specimens left Honduras and are now widely dispersed all over the world. Copan sculptures are in official museums in Honduras, like in the two museums in the town of Copán Ruinas, in the museum in the capital of Hondu ras, in Tegucigalpa, and in the archaeological museum of Comayagua there are two authentic relief sculptures from Copan. There are or were, also, Copan-style sculptures in private collections in Honduras, as in San Pedro Sula (Mayer 1984, Cat. Nos. 20,21) and in Santa Rosa de Copán (Mayer 1984, Cat. No. 22). A major problem of these sculptures is the fact that not all of them were found during scientific surveys and excavations, or were not adequately recorded or published. There are numerous sculptures which are definitely not from the city of Copan, but rather from other archaeological sites in Honduras which share the artistic style of Copan, such as ruins outside the V alley of Copán: Hacienda Grande, Santa Rita, Rio Amarillo (La Canteada), El Paraíso, and Los Higos, just to name a few of the sites where sculptures in the characteristic style of Copan were found (Morley 1920; Yde 1938; Pähl 1977). In many cases, the geographical distance of sites with Copan-style sculptures from the ancient city of Copan is very large: Rio Amarillo is approximately 30 km distant from Copan and Los Higos on the Río Chamelecón even 80 km. A stela from Los Higos (Morley 1920, p. 385, Fig. 62) is stylistically so similar to stelae from Copan that Gary Pähl (1977, p. 136) remarked: "Los Higos Stela 1 displays enough style correspondences with Copán stelae that it would be mistaken for a Copán monument if its provenience were un known". These remarks should make aware that a strong distinction should be made between sculptures which were definitely found at Copan and sculptures of known and unknown prov enance, created in the typical artistic style of Copan. It should be emphasized that the so-called "Copan-style" has a vast spatial distribution in western Honduras and adjacent territo Vol. XXIX • Oktober 2007</page><page sequence="2">ries in Guatemala. Even three-dimensional human head stone sculptures from far-off Quirigua, Guatemala, exhibit a high affinity to comparable Copan examples (Morley 1935, p. 129, Fig. 35). Concerning unprovenanced stone sculptures in the Copan tradition it should be noted that several modern fakes exist, which complicates the situation. Sculptures from Copan and in the Copan-Style outside of Honduras Outside of Honduras several sculpture fragments, predomi nantly stone heads in the round, that are definitely from Copan or unprovenanced objects in the general style of Copan have been registered in several states of Europe. In Belgium, the Musées Royaux d' Art et d'Histoire, Brus sels, possess some specimens (Mayer 1978, Cat. Nos. 3, 4; Mayer 1987, Cat. No. 4), in England, the British Museum, London, houses several outstanding objects (Maudslay 1889 1902; Robicsek 1972, Pis. 66,68,165,196; Mayer 1987, Cat. No. 7, in France there was once a Copan-style stone head in a private collection in Paris (Mayer 1989, Cat. No. 2), and in Germany there is in the Ethnologisches Museum Berlin a stone head of a deity (May er 1991, PI. 14). In Italy, three stone heads are in the collections of the Castello D'Albertis in Genoa (Mayer 1989, Cat. Nos. 5-7). Copan stone sculptures and Copan-style sculptures in the United States of America are deposited in various public institutions. The largest collection of original Copan sculp tures outside of Honduras, obtained in the course of legal archaeological work in the country (1891 -1895), is preserved in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (Robicsek 1972,Pis. 10-13,17,67,148,149,192,197;Ahlfeldt2004,pp.403 408,547,548). The Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, houses an exceptional head (Mayer 1987, Cat. No. 18), the Middle Ameri can Research Institute, Tulane University, New Orleans, pre serves several sculptures, mostly heads, probably from Copan, but also from other sites in Honduras (Robicsek 1972, Figs. 43, 45; Mayer 1989, Cat. Nos. 11-13; Wagner 2002,2004). Other institutions with pertinent sculptures, mostly fragments, are preserved in the New Orleans Museum of Art, New Orleans (Mayer 1987, Cat. Nos. 27 and 28), in the National Museum of the American Indian, New York City (Robicsek 1972, pi. 15, Fig. 44, in The American Museum of Natural History, New York City (Robicsek 1972, Pis. 194,201; Ahlfeld 2004, pp. 363,403 408,545,546), in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia (Robicsek 1972, PI. 15; Danien 2002, PI. 59), in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia (Mayer 1989, Cat. No. 17), and in the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, Washington, D.C. (Benson and Coe 1963, PI. 48). Furthermore, there are, and were, in institutional collec tions, related items, for example the fragment of an arm with bracelet, allegedly from Copan, formerly in the private collec tion of Phil Berg and presently residing in the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles (unpublished), and a human head in The Marjorie Barrick Museum, University of Nevada, in Las Vegas (equally unpublished). In addition to public collections, there are also private collections in the United States where several Copan-style sculptures are housed; moreover some Copan-style sculp tures were offered at auctions (cf. Mayer 1995, Cat. Nos. 19 and 15; Sotheby 'sl997,p.ll0, Lot 178), but their present wherea bouts are unknown. It should be mentioned that two Copan style sculpture fragments, formerly in the hands of private collectors in the United States, have been returned to Hondu ras (National Geographic 1997). In Middle American countries, with the exception of Hon duras, there are three objects in the Museo Nacional "David Guzmán", in San Salvador, ElSalvador(Mayerl979),andafew pieces in Guatemala. Three Copan-style sculptures were inte grated in the modern Puente Grande in the city of Esquipulas, Department of Chiquimula, Guatemala (Mayer 1984, Cat. Nos. 4-6; Mayer 1987, Pis. 45-47), and one fragment depicting plumes, beads and rope elements were recorded in a private collection in Esquipulas (Mayer 1987, Cat. No. 42). In the collections of the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City is a tenoned human head 32 cm high, 26 cm wide, and 40 cm thick. The museum catalogue number of the artifact is 000 (Lehmann and Lehmann 1968, No. 106; see Fig. 1). As provenance "Copán (Honduras)" is given. During my frequent visits to this museum over several decades I failed to see this head either on exhibit or in the museum's storage rooms. Copan-style Sculpture Fragments in Guatemala City In recent years three unprovenanced Copan-style fragments in two museums in Guatemala City came to light which have not been published before and are the primary objective of this brief contribution, which provides also the first illustrations of them. In the following, the three Copan-style stone sculpures are here simply designated as Fragments 1 to 3. Fig. 1.

Cephalomorphic sculpture in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología, Guatemala City (Photo: Karl Herbert Mayer, 2002). Description The fragment depicts feathers adorned with cir cular beads, a frequent motif in the sculptural art of Copan. It could be part of a multi-lithic facade figure, perhaps part of an elaborate plumed headdress (cf. Webster 1989; Fash 1991, pp. 61,86,119,145,164;Baudez 1994,pp.40,41,50,51,60,61,75, 119,120; Ahlfeldt 2004, pp. 313,512). Date Late Classic Remarks In 20021 photographed the fragment in the basement of the museum. In 20061 had the intention of re-photographing it and of taking measurements. In spite of an intensive search the specimen could not be located. The size of the fragment has only been roughly estimated. The original orientation of the illustrated fragment is presently unknown. Photograph Fig. 3 Reference Mayer 2006, No. 31 Fragment 3 Present Location Museo Popol Vuh, Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Guatemala City Catalogue Number 5333 Monument Type Architectural Decoration Material Tuffite Height 44 cm Width A3 cm Thickness 33 cm Condition Of the original sculpture only the head, broken into two parts, survives. The lower section is 19 cm high. At the back are the remains of a tenon, presently only 5 cm long. The top part of the head with an elaborate mask is broken. The surface is moderately eroded. Description The cephalomorphic sculpture in the round de picts a human head with ear decoration, wearing a complex mask as a headgear. The fragmentary tenon at the back of the head proves that the sculpture is not part of a stela but a portion Fig. 3.

The original sculpture was probably a complete anthropomorphic figure. There are vague stylistic and iconographic similarities to a stone head preserved in the Centro Regional de Investigaciones Arqueológicas at Copán, originating from Structure 22, Copan (Schmidt et al. 1998, p. 535, No. 77-Inv. No. CPN-P-244), as well as other heads with intricate mask headdresses from Structure 22 (or 10L-22), illustrated by Jennifer Ahlfeld (2004, p. 521). Date Late Classic Remarks The object was donated by a private person in Guatemala to the museum. In February 2002,1 measured and photographed this sculpture in a storeroom of the Museo Popol Vuh; in March of2006 it was still there and not on exhibit. The slightly greenish color of the stone indicates that the sculpture is made of tuffite, the usual material of sculptures from Copan.

(Notimex). On September 26,2007 the State Department of the United States announced the exten sion of an agreement signed in 1991 to protect the rich archaeological heritage of Guatemala. The State Department stated that this memorandum of consent maintains the restric tions applied 16 years ago on the import of Mayan archaeologi cal pieces which have been subject to looting and illegal trade, to the United States. The extension of the agreement by the United States was in response to a formal petition by the Guatemalan government. In parallel, the Department of Home land Security (DHS) has published a list of categories of objects with United States import restrictions. Such pieces may only be imported to this country if they are accompanied by appropriate documentation. The complete list of prohibited objects can be found on the following website: chttp:// exchanges.state.gov/culprop&gt; Precolumbian artefacts confiscated in Galicia, Spain Havana (Museo del Hombre Dominicano, Juan Rodríguez Acosta). The biggest decommission of archaeological pieces in Spain was carried out by the Spanish Police and INTERPOL in Galicia, Spain.

La probable ubicac ión de un templo dedicado a Xipe Totee en la antigua Tenochtitlan, y que estaría relacionado con la fundación de la urbe mexica, ha sido identificada con base en una investigación documental, la cual refiere que dicho recinto sagrado se encontraría en lo que hoy son las cercanías de la estación Balderas del transporte colectivo metro en México, D.F. De acuerdo con la investigación efectuada por Carlos Javier González González, arqueólogo del INAH y director de Museo del Templo Mayor, se han hallado fuentes documentales que permiten definir la existencia de un templo dedicado a esta deidad relacionada con la guerra y las fuerzas naturales, fuera del recinto sagrado de Tenochtitlan. González González detalló que "fue una de las primeras estructuras arquitectónicas en la antigua ciudad, es decir que estaría relacionada con la fundación de la ciudad mexica, cuya probable construcción se habría efectuado a inicios del siglo XIV, alrededor de 1325". Además comentó que aunque las referencias de las fuentes históricas son pocas, son muy claras en cuanto a la presencia de este templo en un barrio que en la época prehispánica se llamaba Tlalcocomoco, ubicado en la parcialidad suroeste de Tenochtitlan, en un punto que se conocía como Moyotlan y que en la época colonial paso a llamarse San Juan Moyotlán. Esta parcialidad era una de las más antiguas de la ciudad y aunque el recinto religioso en la víspera de la conquista española se encontraba en el área que ocupa actualmente la iglesia del Buen Tono, en donde hoy se alza el mercado de San Juan, los datos sobre la ubicación del templo a Xipe Totee, en Tlacocomoco, lo sitúan más a la orilla de la urbe. "De acuerdo a las referencias, el área donde existió correspondería a las inmediaciones del Centro Escolar Revolución, en las cercanías de la estación Balderas del metro", precisó el arqueólogo.

The first Prehispanic and colonial settlements in the city of Trujillo have been found during archaeological investigations conducted by the Mexi can archaeologists Oscar Nelly Cruz and Francisco Rodríguez. The studies were concentrated in an area historically known as Jericó. Based on the archaeological findings in this area, it • was inhabited by indigenous groups more than 700 years ago. According to recently acquired data, the archaeologists as sume that this place may have been the very first Spanish settlement, from which the Europeans moved to where the fortress is now located. Oscar Nelly Cruz added that so far the actual site has yet to be identified, but in this region there is evidence that indigenous groups settled here, since we have found ceramics and other cultural remains. The excavations have yielded evidence for burials and other artefacts that belonged to a Prehispanic culture. A new discovery is that terraces were built during that time. Cruz pointed out that there is clear evidence that the ancient settlers built mounds by heaping up the terrain, which they then flattened and built stairways onto. These seem to be different from those of the Maya culture, since the population that inhabited the area 500 to 600 years ago were not of Maya origin but of another ethnic group, the Tawakas, perhaps related to the Pech linguistic family. At these sites, the Spanish came into first contact with the indigenous population when they arrived in this part of Central America in the 16th century. Francisco Rodriguez stated that they are continuing ar chaeological testing in order to find the site of the first arrival of the Spaniards. So far, only the indigenous settlements have been found, as indicated by ceramics for both domestic and ritual use, floors of rammed earth and several burials. In one unit a mandible, skull fragments and other bones, perhaps originally an ossuary, were recovered. A problem is the humid ity of the soil, which has led to the bad state of preservation of the bones and their disintegration during cleaning. Current evidence indicates that the former inhabitants buried their dead within their houses. The site being excavated lies near the Cristales river, where worked stones have been found indicat ing the presence of rock art. There are two large rocks, which include one with drilled holes of varying size and another one 10 m upriver engraved with parallel lines. It is possible that these rocks were used to grind and sharpen certain objects. Primer Congreso Internacional sobre Raices y T ray ectorías de Afrocaribeños MÉRIDA (Vera Tiesler). Organized by the Autonomous Uni versity of Yucatan/ Facultad de Ciencias Antropológicas), this congress will be held from November 3 to 7, 2008, in Mérida, Yucatan, Mexico.
