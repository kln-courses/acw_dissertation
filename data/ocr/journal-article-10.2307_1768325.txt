<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF "ROMANTICISM" IN LITERARY HISTORY RENE' WELLEK II. The Unity of European Romanticism F WE examine the characteristics of the actual literature which called itself or was called "romantic" all over the continent, we find throughout Europe the same conceptions of poetry and of the workings and nature of poetic imagination, the same conception of nature and its relation to man, and basically the same poetic style, with a use of imag- ery, symbolism, and myth which is clearly distinct from that of eighteenth-century neoclassicism. This conclusion might be streng- thened or modified by attention to other frequently discussed elements: subjectivism, mediaevalism, folklore, etc. But the following three crite- ria should be particularly convincing, since each is central for one aspect of the practice of literature: imagination for the view of poetry, nature for the view of the world, and symbol and myth for poetic style. German literature is the clearest case; in both so-called romantic schools we find a view of poetry as knowledge of the deepest reality, of nature as a living whole, and of poetry as primarily myth and symbol- ism. This would hardly need to be argued with anyone who had read only Novalis. But it is impossible to accept the common German view that romanticism is the creation of the Schlegels, Tieck, Novalis, and Wackenroder. If one looks at the history of German literature between the date of Klopstock's Messiah (1748) and the death of Goethe (1832), one can hardly deny the unity and coherence of the whole move- ment which, in European terms, would have to be called "romantic." Some German scholars, such as H. A. Korff,1 recognize this and speak of "Goethezeit" or "deutsche Bewegung," terms which, however, ob- scure the international character of the changes. One must, of course, grant distinctions between the different stages of the development. There was the "Storm and Stress" movement in the seventies which exactly parallels what today is elsewhere called "pre- romanticism." It was more radical and violent than anything corres- ponding in England or France, but it must be recognized as substan- 1 Geist der Goethezeit: Versuch einer ideellen Entwicklung der klassisch- ronantischen Literaturgeschichte (Leipzig, 1923-40), 3 vols.

The usual German termi- nology, "die Klassiker," is grossly misleading, since the authors grouped together as the German "classics" form two quite distinct groups; Lessing and Wieland belong to neoclassicism, while Herder was an extremely irrationalistic preromanticist, as were the early Goethe and Schiller. Only these last two authors went through a phase of "classicism," and that for the most part only in their theories. It is hard to find anything classical in Schiller's practice. The nostalgic hymn, "Die G6tter Griechenlands," is rather a typical romantic dream. Goethe, while under the impression of his trip to Italy, for a time ex- pounded a classical creed, especially in his writings on the plastic arts; and he wrote some works which must be considered in any history of neoclassicism: Iphigenie, R8mrische Elegien, Achilleis, possibly Helena. Still, however successfully their classical spirit could be defended, Goethe's greatest works are the subjective lyrics, Faust, the very influ- ential Meister, and of course, Werther. It seems a strange preconcep- tion of many Germans to judge their greatest writer only according to one stage in his development and in accordance with his quite derivative and conventional taste in the fine arts. All the artistic power of Goethe is in the lyrics, in Faust, and in the novels, where there is scarcely any trace of classicism. If we examine Goethe's views of nature, it is obvious that he was an enemy of the Newtonian cosmology, the eighteenth- century world machine, and that he not only defended poetically a dy- namic, organic view of nature, but also attempted to buttress it by scien- tific experiments and speculations (the Theory of Colors, the Meta- morphosis of Plants) and by the use of concepts such as teleology, po- larity, and so forth. Goethe's views are not identical with those of Schel- ling, but they are not easy to distinguish from them, and Schelling was the father of German Naturphilosophie. Goethe was also a symbolist and mythologist both in theory and practice. He interpreted language as a system of symbols and images. All philosophizing about nature was to him only anthropomorphism.2 Goethe was apparently the first to draw clearly the distinction between symbol and allegory.3 He at- tempted to create new myths, such as the Mothers in the second part of Faust, and tried to define poetically the relation of "Gott und Welt." One could use as a commentary to these poems the Neoplatonic cosmo- 2 To Riemer, Gesprdche, ed. F. Biedermann (Leipzig, 1909), I, 505.

There was, one must admit, a pronounced stage of Hellenism in the German movement; its roots are in Winckelmann, an ardent student of Shaftesbury, and this Hellenic enthusiasm early became extremely fervid in Germany. Its main documents are Schiller's Gotter Griechen- lands, H6lderlin's Hyperion and Archipelagus, some of the writings of Wilhelm von Humboldt, Goethe's Winckelmann und sein Jahrhun- dert, and the early writings of Friedrich Schlegel. Still, one need not speak of a "Tyranny of Greece over Germany."6 There was, after all, a comparable Hellenic enthusiasm in France and England. It seems a mistake to underrate these parallel developments because they did not find such embodiment as in Germany's Goethe. French neo-Hellenism has at least one great poet, Andre Chenier. One cannot ignore the Hel- lenic enthusiasms and interests of even Chateaubriand and Lamartine, or the "Dionysiac" conception of Greek mythology charmingly ex- pressed by Maurice de Guerin. We must not forget the Greek revival in painting and sculpture: Canova, Thorwaldsen, Ingres, Flaxman, none of whom were Germans. In England, the role of romantic Hellenism has been studied only recently ;7 it was widespread in the eighteenth century and finds poetic expression of great power in Byron, Shelley, and Keats. The whole of neo-Hellenism, German, English, and French, is not necessarily con- tradictory of romanticism. Homer was interpreted as a primitive poet. Leopardi, arguing against romanticism, appealed to a pastoral, roman- ticized, primitive Greece.8 Surprisingly early the "Orphic," orgiastic side of Greek civilization was recognized: by Friedrich Schlegel, by Schelling, by Maurice de Guerin.9 The conception of antiquity emerg- 4Dichtung und Wahrheit, end of Book 8, Jubilaumsausgabe, XXIII, 163ff.

If this view that a large part of Hellenism is romantic is justified, it will be possible to minimize the excessive stress the Germans have traditionally put on the supposed conflict between their "classicism" and "romanticism." This conflict was in part purely personal, as a detailed history of the relations between Goethe and Schiller and the Schlegels shows,10 and in part it expressed a return of the so-called romantics to the ideals of the Sturm und Drang which Goethe and Schil- ler had attempted, somewhat too strenuously, to repudiate. Still, there is a fundamental unity in the whole of German literature from roughly the middle of the eighteenth century to the death of Goethe. It is an attempt to create a new art different from that of the French seventeenth cen- tury; it is an attempt at a new philosophy which is neither orthodox Christianity nor the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century. This new view emphasizes the totality of man's forces, not reason alone, nor sentiment alone, but rather intuition, "intellectual intuition," imagina- tion. It is a revival of Neoplatonism, a pantheism (whatever its con- sessions to orthodoxy), a monism which arrived at identification of God and the world, soul and body, subject and object. The propound- ers of these ideas were always conscious of the precariousness and difficulty of these views, which frequently appeared to them only as distant ideals; hence the "unending desire" of the German romantics, the stress on evolution, on art as a groping towards the ideal. Exoticism of many kinds is part of the reaction against the eighteenth century and its self-complacency; the suppressed forces of the soul seek their analogies and models in prehistory, in the Orient, in the Middle Ages, and finally in India, as well as in the unconscious and in dreams. The German romantic writers are the contemporaries of the flower- ing of German music: of Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Weber, and others, many of whom used German poetry of the age as texts for their songs or, like Beethoven, as inspiration for their symphonies. The fact of this collaboration is significant but hardly sufficient to make it the distinguishing characteristic of all romanticism.1l Such an emphasis obscures the international character of the movement, since the col- laboration with music was practically nonexistent in England and fairly late and slight in France. It points to the undeniable fact that romanti- cism in Germany was far more pervasive than in the other countries and that it affected all human endeavors-philosophy, politics, philol- ogy, history, science, and all the other arts-there much more thor- oughly than elsewhere. But in this respect also the difference between 10 See Josef K6rner, Romantiker und Klassiker: Die Briider Schlegel in ihren Beziehungen zu Schiller und Goethe (Berlin, 1924). 11 As in Richard Benz, Deutsche Romantik (Leipzig, 1937). 150</page><page sequence="5">THE CONCEPT OF"ROMANTICISM" Germany and the other countries is only relative. There was a roman- tic philosophy, philology, history, politics, and even science, not to speak of painting and music, in other countries, especially in France (Dela- croix, Berlioz, Michelet, Cousin). The apparent isolation of Germany is exaggerated by German writers who see in romanticism a purely German style, and by antiromantics and recently by anti-Hitler propa- gandists who want to prove that all the ills of the last two centuries came from Germany. The only view which takes account of all factors holds that romanticism is a general movement in European thought and art and that it has native roots in every major country. Cultural revolutions of such profound significance are not accomplished by mere importations. Romanticism was more completely victorious in Germany than else- where for very obvious historical reasons. The German Enlighten- ment was weak and of short duration. The Industrial Revolution was late in coming. There was no leading rationalistic bourgeoisie. Both the derivative, unoriginal Enlightenment and the peculiarly rigid re- ligious orthodoxies seemed unsatisfactory. Thus social and intellectual causes opened the way for a literature which was created mostly by unattached intellectuals, tutors, army surgeons, salt-mine officials, court clerks, and the like, who revolted against both feudalism and middle-class ideals. German romanticism, more so than English and French, was the movement of an intelligentsia which had loosened its class ties and hence was particularly apt to create a literature remote from ordinary reality and social concerns. Still, the aestheticism and lack of social "engagement" of writers such as Goethe has been very much exaggerated. One hears too much about the "Olympian" Goethe. It is not realized that the quotation "ein garstig Lied, pfui, ein politisch Lied!" is the dramatic pronouncement of a student in "Auerbachs Keller." While it would be absurd to deny the special features of the German romantic age (we may pause to reflect that every age has its special features), almost all its views and techniques can be paralleled else- where. It is no denial of originality to see that the great German writers drew freely on foreign sources (Rousseau, English preromanticism) or on sources in the remote past, both foreign and native, which had been available to the other European nations: Neoplatonism, Giordano Bruno, B6hme, a reinterpreted Spinoza, Leibniz. The Germans, in turn, influenced other countries; but their influence, for obvious chronological reasons, comes too late to make them the only source of the turn towards the ideas and poetic myths usually called romantic. In England, B6hme was important for Blake, Schelling and August Wilhelm Schlegel for Coleridge, Burger and Goethe for Scott (though hardly centrally so), Goethe and Jean Paul for Carlyle. But the Ger- 151</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE man influence on Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, and even Byron is negligible. In France, German influences came much later; A. W. Schlegel, we have shown, was very important for the introduction of the new critical terminology. German interests are strong in Nodier, in Gerard de Nerval, and in Quinet, who studied Herder and Creuzer. Some argument can be made for the importance of the German song (Lied) for the French romantic lyric;12 but certainly the central fig- ures, Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Vigny, Hugo, Balzac, have few Ger- man affinities, and similarities must be explained by identical ante- cedents in England and an analogous literary and cultural situation. As for France, our view is blurred by the official insistence on be- ginning the romantic movement with the triumph of Hernani (1830), a minor event in a later perspective, which obscures the fact that, out- side of the drama or rather the Parisian official stage, a profound change had come over French literature many years before. This has been widely recognized in France, even though the centenary of ro- manticism was celebrated in 1927. The very first historian of roman- ticism in France, F. R. de Toreinx, says that romanticism was born in 1801, that Chateaubriand was its father, Madame de Stael its god- mother (he is silent about the mother). In 1824, La Muse Francaise noticed the decisive role of Rousseau and Bernardin de St. Pierre; Alfred Michiels, in his HIistoire des idees litteraires en France (1842), was of the opinion that the whole of romanticism can be found in Se- bastien Mercier.13 Some have tried to find the ancestors of romanti- cism even further back in the past; Faguet interpreted French poetry around 1630 with reference to Lamartine, and Brunetiere claimed to see the germs of melodrama in Phedre.14 But more sober views have prevailed. The romantic elements in French eighteenth-century lit- erature have been investigated quite systematically and, on the whole, convincingly; there is today some very fine work by Paul Trahard and Andre Monglond15 on the history of sentimentalism, usually traced back at least as far as Prevost. Daniel Mornet has studied the re- awakening of the feeling for nature and Gilbert Chinard has devoted much attention to French exoticism and primitivism.16 Auguste Viatte 12 See Gertrud Sattler, Das deutsche Lied in der franizsichen Roinantik (Bern, 1932). 13 See Andre Monglond, Le Preromantisme francais (Grenoble, 1930), I, x. 14 See ]fmile Faguet, Histoire de la poesie franCaise de la Renaissance au Ro- mantisme (Paris, n.d.), II, 145, 171ff.; III, 185.

Rousseau, of course, has never ceased to attract attention; he has even been made the wellspring of all romanticism, by friends like J. J. Texte or by enemies who try to reduce romanticism to Rousseauism.l8 But Rous- seau is unduly overrated if he is made the originator of attitudes which he helped popularize but did not invent. Still, all these scattered French studies show isolated anticipations of romantic attitudes, ideas, sentiments, rather than a real romantic literature in eighteenth-cen- tury France. That such a literature existed has best been demonstrated by Kurt Wais,19 who has shown that there was a whole group of French writers who attacked the philosophes and the neoclassical tradition, stressed primitivism, thought that there is cultural decay rather than progress, attacked science, felt well inclined toward religion and even toward superstition and the marvelous. Many of the authors quoted are very minor and even minimal; Ramond de Carbonnieres' Les dernieres aventures du jeune d'Olban (1781) is only a mediocre imita- tion of Werther. But Wais has established that there was a widespread "irrationalism" in writers like Mercier, Chassaignon, Loaisel de Treo- gate, and others, which can be compared with the German Sturm und Drang. This French preromantic movement received a temporary setback through the Revolution, which fostered classicism and rationalism, and by the Empire, which also had its official classicism. But among the eemigres romanticism flourished. Madame de Stael was the propagandist of the German romantics. Chateaubriand cannot be made out a classi- cist, whatever his interests in classical antiquity and his reservations against Shakespeare or against many of his contemporaries. Le Genie du Christianisme (1802) is a romantic poetics. If we apply our tests, it is obvious that Chateaubriand expounds an organic symbolic order of nature, that he is a mythologist and symbolist par excellence. But Madame de Stael and Chateaubriand were by no means alone in their time; even Chenier conceived the idea of a new mythic poetry, especial- ly in the fragment Hermes.20 In Senancour's Obermann (1804) we 17 Les Sources occultes du romantisme (Paris, 1928), 2 vols. 18 J.-J.

"La nature sentie n'est que dans les rapports humains, et l'eloquence des choses n'est rien que 1'eloquence de l'homme. La terre feconde, les cieux immenses, les eaux passageres ne sont qu'une expression des rapports que nos cceurs pro- duisent et contiennent."21 Obermann constantly finds in external things analogies which give us the feeling of a universal order. Even flowers, a sound, a smell, a gleam of light become the "materials which an external idea arranges like figures of an invisible thing." The states of mind described by Senancour are extraordinarily similar to Wordsworth's, but unlike Wordsworth (not to speak of Novalis' "magic" idealism) Senancour experiences them almost as a curse. He complains bitterly that fate has condemned him to have only a "dream of his existence."22 His art is rather that of passive reverie. In Charles Nodier also we find the whole repertory of romantic themes and ideas. Nodier was a quite technical entomologist who mythologized the world of insects. He sees in nature an alphabet which needs deciphering. In the world of insects and infusoria, he finds a gro- tesque parallel to the forms of human art, and in the universe a process of "syngenesie," a fantastic evolution toward a human Utopia. Nodier knew Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, and used the work of an Italian physiologist, Malpighi. He wrote romantic fairy tales (La Fee aux Miettes) and fantasies such as Lydie ou la Resurrection (1839), which has obvious affinities with Novalis' Hymnen an die Nacht.23 Lamartine's Harmonies poetiques et religieuses (1830) ties com- pletely into our scheme; one could hardly find a more precise expres- sion of the romantic view of nature as a language, as a concert of har- monies. The whole universe is conceived of as a system of symbols, correspondences, emblems, which at the same time is alive and pul- sates rhythmically. The task of the poet is not only to read this alpha- bet, but to vibrate with it, to sense and reproduce its rhythm. La Chute d'un Ange (1838) has a mythological conception of the epic similar to Ballanche; there is the scale of being, there is the concept of the trans- formation of each atom and element into thought and sentiment.24 Vigny is different. He does not accept the romantic concept of nature, but embraces a dualism of man and nature, a pessimistic titanism which is a continuous protest against the order of nature. Nature is dead, si- lent, and even hostile to man. But this sharp ethical dualism of man ver- 21 Ed. G.

They are the branches to which we can cling in the void which surrounds us... Each man is nothing but an image of an idea of the general mind."25 Many of Vigny's poems are organized around such symbols as Le Cor, La Neige, La Bouteille i la uer. Vigny's preoccu- pation with myth is obvious; he planned a most ambitious series which was to include a Last Judgment and "Satan Sauve." Only Eloa, a "mystery," and Le Deluge were carried out. Victor Hugo, later in his life, became the most ambitious mytholo- gist, symbolist, prophet of a new religion, of all the romantics. His fame has declined in the twentieth century, but recently several at- tempts have been made to rescue these late works-parts of the Le- gende des Siecles, La Fin de Satan, Dieu. These attempts emanate not only from academic scholars, but also from surrealist poets.26 They stress the mythic, eerie, grand, and sometimes absurd late Hugo. He fits into our scheme beautifully, whatever we may think of the quality of the poetry. Historians of ideas "have marvelled at the unperturbed serenity of a synthesis which does not flinch before self-contradiction, which, at once pantheist and deist, shows God disseminated in the uni- verse and yet transcendent and personal; which draws from all sources, from the modern Platonists and Pythagoreans . . . Swedenborg, Bal- lanche, from the contemporary Illuminati, from Cabbalists, but per- sists in wresting originality out of a many-sided indebtedness." Hugo expounds a panpsychism of nature; a conviction of omnisentience (e.g., Le Sacre de la Femme), of the "victory of unity over diversity, of All over the ephemeral, the victory of universal and palpitating life over all that limits, curtails, frustrates, and denies."27 In Le Satyre the satyr is haled before the gods and asked to sing in order to amuse the con- temptuous Olympians. "Le satyre chanta la terre monstrueuse." His stature increases in singing, he becomes an incarnation of nature and life. The faun declares himself in the concluding line: Place a tout Je suis Pan, Jupiter, a genoux! In La Fin de Satan, Satan is pardoned and dies in a surprising conclu- sion, God saying: Satan est mort! renais, o Lucifer celeste! Evil is reabsorbed because Satan actually loved God, was himself a part of the providential scheme. In Dieu, Hugo passes in review the 25 Journal d'un poate, ed. F.

A spiritual pantheism is expounded by an angel: Tous les etres sont Dieu; tous les flots sont la mer. The poem concludes in a hymn to God, who is conceived as a bewilder- ing series of contradictions, a dazzling light which is, at the same time, darkness. Rien n'existe que Lui; le flamboiement profond. In Hugo, then, all the romantic convictions and themes are summa- rized: organic, evolving nature, the view of poetry as prophecy, the view that symbol and myth are the instruments of poetry. In Hugo the reconciliation of opposites, the stress on the grotesque and evil ulti- mately absorbed in the harmony of the universe, is particularly clear and was clear even in his early aesthetic theories, as in the preface to Cromwell. His prophetic fervor, intensity, and grandiose gestures may have become pretentious and absurd to generations who have lost this view of poetry. But Hugo marshalled all the possible arguments for the romantic view of nature, for man's continuity with nature, the great scale of nature, and the final perfection of man. Balzac is not usually considered a romantic and he may not be one in many aspects of his stupendous work. But E. R. Curtius28 has rightly stressed an aspect which must have struck every reader of the Human Comedy-Balzac's interest in magic and the occult. A study of Balzac's religious views reveals that he declared himself a Swedenborgian many times. In Louis Lambert, which contains much that is autobiography, there is an exposition of a system which must be substantially Balzac's and exuberant praise of Swedenborg as the "Buddha of the North." Seraphita also is full of Swedenborgianism, a theosophical and pan- theistic philosophy of immanence, which Balzac must have considered compatible with Catholicism and his specific endorsement of political Catholicism. Whatever Balzac's exact religious views, he certainly held this organic view of nature which he calls magisme. He was deeply impressed by contemporary biology, especially by Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire and his view that there is only one animal. He was absorbed and taken in by all forms of magnetism, mesmerism, and phrenology, all of which uphold the "unity of nature." Like the romantics, Balzac had a theory of intuition, to which he applies the queer term, specialite, dis- tinguishing it from instinct and abstraction.29 He was also a rdent mythologist, giving a symbolic interpretation to all rites, cults, myths, mysteries of religion, and creations of art. "Today hieroglyphics are not 28Balzac (Bonn, 1923). 29 Louis Lambert, fragment XVI. 156</page><page sequence="11">THE CONCEPT OF "ROMANTICISM" any more impressed in Egyptian marble, but in mythologies which are unified worlds." Balzac said of La Peau de Chagrin, "tout y est mythe et figure."30 He himself constantly gave symbolic interpretations; e.g., La Vieille fille contains a strange symbolic use of Orlando Furioso. Though wide stretches of Balzac's work may not show it, he was in- spired by a peculiar type of romantic metaphysics, physics, or energe- tics, with its supposed laws of compensations, polarities, fluids, etc. Among the authors less well known today many fit in with our cri- teria. Pierre-Simon Ballanche had a mystical, Pythagorean conception of nature and the harmony of the spheres (the seven numbers produce an endless concert) ; an apocalypse is presented in which matter will be spiritualized by a new magnetism, and the animals disappear as their life, by assimilation, becomes the life of man. Ballanche was not only a mythologist and fantastic philosopher of nature but also a symbolist who, long before Mallarme, conceived the unity of the senses.31 Edgar Quinet is related to Ballanche and, of course, to the Germans. To him, religion was the business of the poet; the poet destroys the fixed symbols of dogma in order to renew them. Quinet believed also in some future universal epic which will "reconcile all legends by fus- ing them into one".3a Maurice de Guerin also fits into our scheme. He shows the major points of agreement: the views of the substantial unity of nature, the continuity in the chain of creation, the primacy of the intuitive faculty in man, which is especially active in poets, whose role is to decipher the "flottant appareil de symboles qu'on appelle l'univers." His sense of identity with nature is finely expressed in his journal. "Se laisser pene- trer a la nature ... s'identifier au printemps ... aspirer en soi toute la vie... se sentir a la fois fleur, verdure, oiseau, chant, fraicheur, elasticite, volupte, serenite." Guerin wants to "sentir presque physiquement que l'on vit de Dieu et en Dieu." He aspired to create neopagan myths, like Le Centaure, and to spiritualize nature, as in the Meditation sur la mort de Marie; he had the romantic thirst to ascend to the origins of mankind and of himself as a child, to find the "point de depart de la vie universelle."32 Gerard de Nerval is the most mystical, "supernatural," of the French romantics, the nearest to the most fantastic Germans whom he knew and loved. The symbolists have recognized him as their precursor. Au- 30 Curtius, op. cit., pp. 69-70. 31 "Tous les sens se reveillent reciproquement l'un l'autre.

Nerval, exactly like Keats, believed in the literal truth of anything imagination has in- vented. The whole of Nerval's work is a world of dream symbols and myths. He is full of Swedenborgianism and other occult beliefs; nature is emblematic through and through. He speaks of "a vast conspiracy of all animate beings to re-establish the world in its first harmony": How can I have existed so long, I said to myself, outside Nature without identi- fying myself with her ? Everything lives, everything acts, everything corresponds; the magnetic rays emanating from myself or others traverse unimpeded the infinite chain of created things; it is a transparent network which covers the world, and its fine threads communicate from one to another to the planets and the stars. I am now a captive on the earth, but I converse with choiring stars, who share my joys and sorrows !33 I have already suggested some of the sources of French romanticism -Swedenborg, St. Martin, the Germans. But we must realize that in all phases of French thought there was a considerable parallel activity. In history Michelet propounded a "historical symbolism." The nu- merous neo-Catholic French thinkers shared many of the main roman- tic tenets and motifs. There is "striking similarity between the doc- trines of Hegel and Bonald."34 Joseph de Maistre, in his youth at least, was steeped in the mythical, Masonic, and Illuminati ideas of the time, and they left strong traces on his mature thought. A letter to Bonald states that "the physical world is nothing but an image or, if you pre- fer, the formula, a repetition of the spiritual world." Matter does not exist independently of mind. Catholicism does not totally reject poly- theism; it rather explains and corrects the Graeco-Roman mythology. "The name of God, no doubt, is exclusive and incommunicable; still, there are many gods in heaven and earth. There are intelligences, bet- ter natures, deified men. The gods of Christianity are the saints."35 The whole eclectic movement, fed as it is in part from German sources, especially Schelling, fits into our scheme, and much in the French science of the time, particularly biology, helps to re-create the whole mental "climate" in which French romanticism flourished. Turning to England, we can see a complete agreement with the French and the Germans on all essential points. The great poets of the English romantic movement constitute a fairly coherent group, with the same view of poetry and the same conception of imagination, the same view of nature and mind. They share also a poetic style, a use of imagery, symbolism, and myth, which is quite distinct from anything 33 Arelia, translated by Richard Aldington (London, 1932), pp. 51-52. 34 See George Boas, French Philosophies of the Romantic Period (Baltimore, 1925), p. 73. 35 Le Pape, in (Euvres, IV, 541, quoted by Viatte, op. cit., in note 17, pp. 79-80. 158</page><page sequence="13">THE CONCEPT OF "ROMANTICISM" that had been practiced by the eighteenth century, and which was felt by their contemporaries to be obscure and almost unintelligible. The affinity of the concepts of imagination among the English ro- mantic poets scarcely needs demonstration. Blake considers all nature to be "imagination itself." Our highest aim is: To see a world in a grain of sand: And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour.36 Thus imagination is not merely the power of visualization, somewhere in between sense and reason, which it had been to Aristotle or Addi- son, nor even the inventive power of the poet, which by Hume and many other eighteenth-century theorists was conceived of as a "com- bination of innate sensibility, the power of association, and the faculty of conception,"37 but a creative power by which the mind "gains insight into reality, reads nature as a symbol of something behind or within nature not ordinarily perceived."38 Thus imagination is the basis of Blake's rejection of the mechanistic world picture, the basis of an ide- alistic epistemology- The Sun's Light, when he unfolds it Depends on the Organ that beholds it ;39 and, of course, the basis of an aesthetics, the justification of art and his own peculiar kind of art. This conception of imagination sufficiently justifies the necessity of myth and of metaphor and symbol as its vehicle. The concept of the imagination in Wordsworth is fundamentally the same, though Wordsworth draws more heavily on eighteenth-century theories and compromises with naturalism. Still, Wordsworth cannot be explained entirely in Hartley's terms ;40 imagination is for him "cre- ative," an insight into the nature of reality and hence the basic justifi- cation of art. The poet becomes a living soul who "sees into the life of things." Imagination is thus an organ of knowledge which transforms objects, sees through them, even if they are only the "meanest flower" or the humble ass, an idiot boy, or simply a child: "mighty prophet, seer blest." The whole of the Prelude is a history of the poet's imagination which, in a central passage of the last book, is called 36 "Auguries of Innocence," Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed.

"All great poets are in this view powerful Religionists."42 It is hardly necessary to explain what a central role the imagination plays in Coleridge's theory and practice. There is a book by I. A. Rich- ards, Coleridge on Imagination, and recently R. P. Warren has care- fully related the theory to the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.43 The key passage in Biographia Literaria on primary and secondary imagination is too well known to need quoting.44 It is Schellingian in its formula- tion-on the whole, Coleridge's theory is closely dependent on the Ger- mans. His term for "imagination," the "esemplastic power," is a trans- lation of "Einbildungskraft," based on a fanciful etymology of the Ger- man.45 But, when Coleridge ignores his technical jargon, as in the ode Dejection (1802), he still speaks of the "shaping spirit of the imagina- tion," of imagination as a "dim analogue of creation, not all that we believe, but all that we can conceive of creation."46 If Coleridge had not known the Germans, he would have been able to expound a Neo- platonic theory, just as Shelley did in his Defense of Poetry. Shelley's Defense of Poetry is almost identical, in general conception, with Coleridge's theory. Imagination is the "principle of synthesis." Poetry may be defined as the "expression of the imagination." A poet "participates in the eternal, the infinite, and the one." Poetry lifts the veil from the "hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar." "Poetry redeems from decay the visi- tations of the divinity in man." To Shelley imagination is creative, and the poet's imagination is an instrument of knowledge of the real. Shel- ley, more sharply than any other English poet with the exception of Blake, states that the poetic moment is the moment of vision; that the words are but a "feeble shadow," that the mind in composition is a 41 Prelude, XIV, 190ff. 42 Jan. 21, 1824.

The affinities and fundamental identities of Keats' views are ob- vious, though Keats (under the influence of Hazlitt) has more of the sensationalist vocabulary than either Coleridge or Shelley. But he also says: "What the Imagination seizes as Beauty must be Truth whether it existed before or not."48 Clarence D. Thorpe, in analyzing all of Keats' relevant scattered pronouncements, concludes: "Such is the power of creative imagination, a seeing, reconciling, combining force that seizes the old, penetrates beneath its surface, disengages the truth slumbering there, and, building afresh, bodies forth anew a recon- structed universe in fair forms of artistic power and beauty."49 This could be a summary of the theories of imagination of all the romantic poets. Clearly, such a theory implies a theory of reality and, especially, of nature. There are individual differences among the great romantic poets concerning the conception of nature. But all of them share a com- mon objection to the mechanistic universe of the eighteenth century- even though Wordsworth admires Newton and accepts him, at least in the orthodox interpretation. All romantic poets conceived of nature as an organic whole, on the analogue of man rather than a concourse of atoms-a nature that is not divided from aesthetic values, which are just as real (or rather more real) than the abstractions of science. Blake stands somewhat apart. He violently objects to the eighteenth- century cosmology, personified by Newton. May God us keep From Single Vision and Newton's sleep !50 Blake's writings are also full of condemnations of Locke and Bacon, atomism, deism, natural religion, and so forth. But he does not share the romantic deification of nature; he comments expressly on Words- worth's preface to the Excursion: "You shall not bring me down to be- lieve such fitting and fitted."51 To Blake nature is everywhere fallen. It fell with man; the fall of man and the creation of the physical world were the same event. In the Golden Age to come, nature will (with man) be restored to her pristine glory. Man and nature are, in Blake, not only continuous, but emblematic of each other: 47 Shelley's Literary and Philosophical Criticism, ed. J. Shawcross (London, 1909), pp. 131, 155, 153. 48 Letter to B.

The ridges of mountains across the world are Albion's fractured spine. Nothing exists outside Albion; sun, moon, stars, the center of the earth, and the depth of the sea were all within his mind and body. Time even is a pulsation of the artery, and space a globule of blood. The crabbed symbolism, the strident tone have kept these later poems from being widely read; but the books by Damon, Percival, Schorer, and Frye53 have shown the subtlety and coherence of Blake's specula- tions which set him in the great tradition of Naturphilosophie as it comes down from Plato's Timaeus to Paracelsus, B6hme, and Swedenborg. In Wordsworth's conception of nature there is a shift from some- thing like animistic pantheism to a conception reconcilable with tradi- tional Christianity. Nature is animated, alive, filled with God or the Spirit of the World; it is mysteriously present, it gives a discipline of fear and ministry of pleasure.54 Nature is also a language, a system of symbols. The rocks, the crags, the streams on Simplon Pass Were all like workings of one mind, the features Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree; Characters of the great Apocalypse The types and symbols of Eternity.55 We would misunderstand idealistic epistemology if we questioned the "objectivity" which Wordsworth ascribes to these conceptions.

The general concept of nature he shares with his friend Coleridge.

Echoes of this contemporary science also permeate Shelley's concep- tions and even images. There are many allusions in his poetry to chemi- cal, electrical, and magnetic theories-to theories expounded by Eras- mus Darwin, and Humphrey Davy.60 But, in general terms, Shelley mainly echoes Wordsworth and Coleridge on the "spirit of nature." There is the same concept of the vitality of nature, its continuity with man, its emblematic language. There is also the concept of the coopera- tion and interrelation of subject and object, as in the beginning of Mont Blanc: The everlasting universe of things Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, Now dark-now glittering-now reflecting gloom- Now lending splendor, where from secret springs The source of human thought its tribute brings Of waters,-with a sound but half its own. This seems to say: There is nothing outside the mind of man, but the receptive function of the stream of consciousness is very much larger than the tiny active principle in the mind. My own, my human mind, which passively Now renders and receives fast influencings, Holding an unremitting interchange With the clear universe of things around. Here we have, in spite of the stress on the passivity of the mind, a clear conception of a give and take, of an interchange between its creative and purely receptive principles. Shelley conceives of nature as one phenom- enal flux; he sings of clouds, wind, and water rather than, like Words- worth, of the mountains or the "soul of lonely places." But he does not, of course, stop with nature, but seeks the higher unity behind it: Life, like a dome of many-colored glass, Stains the white radiance of Eternity.61 In the highest ecstasy, all individuality and particularly are abolished by the great harmony of the world. But in Shelley, in contrast to Blake or Wordsworth who calmly look into the life of things, the ideal itself dissolves; his voice falters; the highest exaltation becomes a total loss of personality, an instrument of death and annihilation. In Keats, the romantic conception of nature occurs, but only in at- tenuated form, though it would be hard to deny the poet of Endymion or the Ode to a Nightingale an intimate relation to nature and to the 60 Much evidence in C.

Hyperion (1820) obscurely hints at an optimistic evolutionism, as in the speech of Oceanos to his fellow Titans: We fall by course of Nature's laws, Not force .... As thou wast not the first of powers So art thou not the last... So on our heels a fresh perfection treads. ... for 'tis the eternal law That first in beauty should be first in might.61a But Keats, possibly because he was a doctor, was least affected by the romantic conception of nature. This conception occurs, though only fitfully, in Byron, who does not share the romantic conception of imagination. It is present especially in the third canto of Childe Harold (1818), written in Geneva when Shelley was his constant companion: I live not in myself, but I become Portion of that around me; and to me High mountains are a feeling. Byron mentions: ... the feeling infinite, so felt In solitude where we are least alone; A truth which through our being then doth melt And purifies from self.62 But generally Byron is rather a deist who believes in the Newtonian world machine and constantly contrasts man's passion and unhappiness with the serene and indifferent beauty of nature. Byron knows the hor- ror of man's isolation, the terrors of the empty spaces, and does not share the fundamental rejection of the eighteenth-century cosmology nor the feeling of continuity and basic at-homeness in the universe of the great romantic poets. This conception of the nature of poetic imagination and of the uni- verse has obvious consequences for poetic practice. All the great ro- mantic poets are mythopoeic, are symbolists whose practice must be understood in terms of their attempt to give a total mythic interpreta- tion of the world to which the poet holds the key. The contemporaries of Blake began this revival of mythic poetry-which can be seen even in their interest in Spenser, in Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tem- pest, in the devils and witches of Burns, in the interest of Collins in Highland superstitions and their value for the poet, in the pseudo-Norse mythology of Gray, and in the antiquarian researches of Jacob Bryant 61a Book II, lines 181-182, 189, 212, 228-229. 62 Childe Harold, canto III, stanzas lxxii and xc. 165</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE and Edward Davies. But the first English poet to create a new myth- ology on a grand scale was Blake. Blake's mythology is neither classical nor Christian, though it incor- porates many Biblical and Miltonic elements. It draws vaguely on some Celtic (Druidical) mythology or rather names, but essentially it is an original (possibly a too original) creation which tries to give both a cosmogony and an apocalypse: a philosophy of history, a psychology, and (as has been recently stressed) a vision of politics and morals. Even the simplest of the Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience are permeated by Blake's symbols. His last poems, such as Jerusalem, require an effort of interpretation which may not be commensurate to the aesthetic rewards we get; but Northrop Frye has certainly shown convincingly that Blake was an extraordinarily original thinker who had ideas on cycles of culture, metaphysical theories of time, specula- tions about the universal diffusion throughout primitive society of archetypal myths and rituals-which may be frequently confused and dilettantish, but which should not prove incomprehensible to an age which has acclaimed Toynbee, or Dunne on time, or has developed modern anthropology. Wordsworth, at first sight, is the romantic poet farthest removed from symbolism and mythology. Josephine Miles in her study, Words- worth and the Vocabulary of Emotion,63 has taken him as the prime example of the poet who states emotions, names them specifically. But Wordsworth does stress imagery in his theory and is by no means in- different to mythology. He plays an important part in the new interest in Greek mythology interpreted in terms of animism. There is the son- net, "The World is too much with us," and there is a passage in the fourth book of the Excursion (1814) which celebrates the dim ink- lings of immortality that the Greek sacrificing a lock in a stream may have had. There is the later turning to classical mythology, Laodamia and the Ode to Lycoris, poems which Wordsworth defended also for their material "which may ally itself with real sentiment." But, most important, his poetry is not without pervading symbols. Cleanth Brooks has shown convincingly how the Ode on Intimations is based on a double, contradictory metaphor of light and how even the sonnet, "Upon Westminster Bridge," conceals an all-pervasive figure.64 The White Doe of Rylstone may be really allegorical, in an almost nlediaeval sense (the Doe is like an animal in a Bestiary), but even this late piece shows Wordsworth's endeavor to go beyond the anecdotal or the descriptive, beyond the naming and analyzing of emotions and states of mind. 63 Berkeley, 1942. 64 The Well Wrought Urn (New York, 1947). 166</page><page sequence="21">THE CONCEPT OF "ROMANTICISM" In Coleridge a theory of symbolism is central; the artist discourses to us by symbols, and nature is a symbolic language. The distinction between symbol and allegory is, in Coleridge, related to that between imagination and fancy (which, in some ways, can be described as a theory of imagery), genius and talent, reason and understanding. In a late discussion he says that an allegory is but a translation of abstract notions into a picture language, which is itself nothing but an abstrac- tion from objects of sense. On the other hand, a symbol is characterized by a translucence of the special in the individual, or of the general in the special, or of the universal in the general; above all, a symbol is charac- terized by the translucence of the eternal through and in the temporal. The faculty of symbols is the imagination. Coleridge condemned classi- cal as distinct from Christian mythology in many early pronounce- ments; but later he became interested in a symbolically reinterpreted Greek mythology and wrote a queer piece "On the Prometheus of Aeschylus" (1825), which is closely dependent on Schelling's treatise, U'ber die Gottheiten von Samothrace (1815).65 The early great poetry of Coleridge is certainly symbolic throughout. R. P. Warren has recently given an interpretation of the Ancient Mari- ner, which may go too far in detail, but is convincing in the general thesis-the whole poem implies a concept of "sacramentalism," of the holiness of nature and all natural beings, and is organized on symbols of moonlight and sunlight, wind and rain.66 That Shelley is a symbolist and mythologist needs no argument. Not only is Shelley's poetry metaphorical through and through, but he as- pires to create a new myth of the redemption of the earth which uses classical materials very freely, e.g., in Prometheus Unbound (1820), in the Witch of Atlas, and in Adonais (1821). This last poem can be easily misinterpreted if it is seen merely as a pastoral elegy in the tradi- tion of Bion and Moschus. Through Shelley's poetry runs a fairly con- sistent system of recurrent symbols: the eagle and the serpent (which has Gnostic antecedents), temples, towers, the boat, the stream, the cave, and, of course, the veil, the cupola of stained glass, and the white radiance of eternity.67 Death is the veil which those who live call life: They sleep and it is lifted.68 In Shelley the ecstasy takes on a hectic, falsetto tone, the voice breaks 65 The Statesman's Manual, in Complete Works, ed.

"I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed."69 Shelley would like us to transcend the boundaries of individuality, to be absorbed into some Nirvana. This craving for unity explains also one pervading characteristic of his style; synaes- thesia and the fusing of the spheres of the different senses in Shelley is paralleled in his rapid transitions and fusions of the emotions, from pleasure to pain, from sorrow to joy. Keats is a mythologist, too. Endymion and Hyperion are eloquent witnesses. There is in Keats the recurrent symbolism of moon and sleep, temple and nightingale. The great odes are not merely a series of pic- tures, but symbolic constructions in which the poet tries to state the conflict of artist and society, time and eternity. Byron also-as Wilson Knight has shown extravagantly in The Burning Oracle70-can be interpreted in these terms: Manfred (1817), Cain, Heaven and Earth, and even Sardanapalus (1821). The great poets are not alone in their time. Southey wrote his epics, Tha- laba, Madoc (1805), The Curse of Kehama (1810), on mythological themes from ancient Wales and India. Thomas Moore gained fame with the Oriental pseudosplendor of Lalla Rookh (1817), Mrs. Tighe's Psyche influenced Keats. Finally, in 1821, Carlyle published Sartor Resartus, with its philosophy of clothes. Whatever the level of penetra- tion, there is a widespread return to the mythic conception of poetry which had been all but forgotten in the eighteenth century. Pope at most could conceive of burlesque machines such as the Sylphs in the Rape of the Lock or the grandiose, semiserious last yawn of Night at the con- clusion of the Dunciad.T7 It could be argued that these romantic attitudes, beliefs, and tech- niques were confined to a small group of great poets and that, on the whole, the England of the early nineteenth century shared many points of view with the Age of Reason. One may grant that the English ro- mantic movement was never as self-conscious or, possibly, as radical as the German or French movements, that eighteenth-century attitudes were far more influential and widespread than on the continent, e.g., in philosophy where utilitarianism and Scottish common-sense philoso- phy held sway, and that the English romantic theory of poetry is a curious amalgamation of sensualism and associationism, inherited from the eighteenth century and the new or old Platonic idealism. The only major writer who propounded a coherent "idealistic" system was Cole- 69 "The Indian Serenade," "Ode to the West Wind." 70 London, 1939. 70a D. K. Wimsatt's excellent "The Structure of Romantic Nature Imagery," in The Age of Johnson: Essays Presented to C. B.

But there is a good deal of evidence among the minor writers also that the intellectual atmosphere was changing in England. Some of the minor proponents of Kant, such as the curious jeweler, Thomas Wirgman, may be cited.71 There was much romantic science, biology, and chemistry in England, of which we know very little today. If we examine the literary ideas and scholarship of the time, we can trace the changes which occurred somewhat earlier on the continent. The romantic conception of folklore can be found, e.g., in the very cur- ious preface to the second edition of Thomas Warton's History of Eng- lish Poetry, by Richard Price (1824); Price knew the Schlegels, the Brothers Grimm, and even Creuzer's Symbolik.72 In 1827, William Motherwell, the first faithful editor of the Scottish ballads, spoke of popular poetry as "that body of poetry which has inwoven itself with the feelings and passions of the people, and which shadows forth as it were an actual embodiment of their Universal mind, and its intellectual and moral tendencies."73 Much research in minor writers and periodi- cals would be needed to substantiate this fully, but enough evidence has been produced to show that England also underwent the change of in- tellectual atmosphere which was general in Europe. Much space would be needed to examine all the other European literatures adequately from this point of view. Italy has sometimes been considered an exception; it has even been denied that it had any "real" romanticism.74 But, while one may grant the strong survivals of neo- classicism, the peculiarly vehement political orientation, and the ab- sence of some themes of the Northern romantic literatures, Italy can- not be considered to deviate from the pattern. Leopardi certainly is in profound agreement with his great contemporaries across the Alps, even though his literary theories have many neoclassical traits. For his romantic concept of nature, the early poem L'infinito (1819) is evi- dence,75 as well as his speculations on the great poetic harmony, the "effetto poetico" of the totality of nature. Foscolo and Manzoni, both as critics and as artists, are part and parcel of the European romantic movement. Gioberti expounded an aesthetics similar to Schelling's. Allison Peers has argued that Spanish romanticism was of very short 71 See my Kant in England (Princeton, 1931). 72 W. C. Hazlitt's ed.

Espronceda, especially, seems to fit our pattern very closely. In the Scandinavian countries, German romanticism, especially Schelling, was most influential. Among the Swedes a whole group of critics viewed the work of art as a symbol of the universe.77 Naturphilo- sophie was widely accepted, and mythologizing was at the very center of the whole Nordic revival. The Slavic romantic movements present special features and special problems. The Russians drew heavily on the Germans, especially on Schelling and Hegel.78 Lermontov fits into our pattern as does, of course, Vladimir Odoevsky, whose stories of artists, such as "Johann Sebastian Bach," are full of the theory of correspondences, the view of art as a mediator between man and nature.79 Pushkin, to a certain ex- tent, is an exception; his clear form seems neoclassical, and recent Rus- sian literary scholarship excludes him from the romantic movement.80 But this is hardly warranted if one considers not only the usually quoted affinities with Byron, but recognizes also Pushkin's nature sym- bolism, which has been studied, possibly oversubtly, by Gershenzon, or if one considers his myth of the destructive statue, in the Stone Guest, the Bronze Horseman, and the Tale of the Golden Cockerel.81 Polish romantic literature is the most romantic of all minor litera- tures: Mickiewicz and Slowacki share fully the romantic view of nature, the romantic concept of the imagination and the use of symbol and mythology, and express them even extravagantly. So do such Polish romantic thinkers as Hoene-Wronski. The Czech romantic move- ment has at least one great poet, Karel Hynek Macha, who shares the concept of nature, of imagination, and of symbol with his German and Polish contemporaries.82 One important argument for the coherence and unity of the European romantic movement emerges from an in- vestigation of the minor literatures-the "predictability" of their gen- eral character.

My conclusion concerning the unity of the romantic movement may be distressingly orthodox and even conventional. But it seems necessary to reassert it, especially in view of Lovejoy's famous attack. "On the Discrimination of Romanticisms" proves, it seems to me, only that Jo- seph Warton was an early naturalistic preromanticist, that Friedrich Schlegel was a highly sophisticated, self-conscious intellectual, and that Chateaubriand held many classicist views on literary criticism and on Shakespeare. The fact that Chateaubriand was conservative and Hugo ended in liberalism does not disrupt the continuity of French romanti- cism as a literary movement. On the whole, political criteria seem grossly overrated as a basis for judging a man's basic view of the world and artistic allegiance. I do not, of course, deny differences between the various romantic movements, differences of emphasis and distribution of elements, dif- ferences in the pace of development, in the individualities of the great writers. I am perfectly aware that the three groups of ideas I have selected have their historical ancestry before the age of Enlightenment and in undercurrents during the eighteenth century. The view of an organic nature descends from Neoplatonism through Giordano Bruno, Bohme, the Cambridge Platonists, and some passages in Shaftesbury. The view of imagination as creative and of poetry as prophecy has a similar ancestry. A symbolist, and even mythic, conception of poetry is frequent in history, e.g., in the baroque age with its emblematic art, its view of nature as hieroglyphics which man ad especially the poet is destined to read. In a sense, romanticism is the revival of something old, but it is a revival with a difference; these ideas were translated into terms acceptable to men who had undergone the experience of the Enlightenment. It may be difficult to distinguish clearly between a ro- mantic and a baroque symbol, the romantic and the B6hmian view of nature and imagination. But for our problem we need only know that there is a difference between the symbol in Pope and in Shelley. This can be described; the change from the type of imagery and symbolism used by Pope to that used by Shelley is an empirical fact of history. It seems difficult to deny that we are confronted with substantially the same fact in noting the difference between Lessing and Novalis or Voltaire and Victor Hugo. Lovejoy has argued that the "new ideas of the period were in large part heterogeneous, logically independent and sometimes essentially antithetic to one another in their implications."83 If we look back on our argument, it will be obvious that this view must be mistaken. There is, 83 "The Meaning of Romanticism for the Historian of Ideas," Journal of the History of Ideas, II (1941), 261. 171</page><page sequence="26">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE on the contrary, a profound coherence and mutual implication between the romantic views of nature, imagination, and symbol. Without such a view of nature we could not believe in the significance of symbol and myth. Without symbol and myth the poet would lack the tools for the insight into reality which he claimed, and without such an epistemology, which believes in the creativity of the human mind, there would not be a living nature and a true symbolism. We may not accept this view of the world for ourselves-few of us can accept it literally today-but we should grant that it is coherent and integrated and, as I hope I have shown, all-pervasive in Europe. We can then go on speaking of romanticism as one European move- mrent, whose slow rise through the eighteenth century we can describe and examine and even call, if we want to, preromanticism. Clearly there are periods of the dominance of a system of ideas and poetic practices; and clearly they have their anticipations and their survivals. To give up these problems because of the difficulties of terminology seems to me tantamount to giving up the central task of literary history. If literary history is not to be content to remain the usual odd mixture of biography, bibliography, anthology, and disconnected emotive cri- ticism, it has to study the total process of literature. This can be done only by tracing the sequence of periods, the rise, dominance, and dis- integration of conventions and norms. The term "romanticism" posits all these questions, and that, to my mind, is its best defense.84 Yale University 84 In Part I of this study, supra, pp. 1-23, the following misprints should be corrected: p. 5, line 10, read "romantisch"; p. 11, line 22, read 1822; p. 12, line 19, read "romantick"'; line 29, read "Romantyczno.sc"; line 32, read year for war; p. 13, note 46a, read Syn otechestva; p. 15, line 6, read taste; p. 17, line 35, read trace; p. 20, line 7, read 1844-EDITOR'S NOTE. 172</page></plain_text>
