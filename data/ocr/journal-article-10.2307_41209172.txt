This was the first Shakespeare festival to engage national in- terest, and it fired the public imagination. It was both vilified and defended; was reproduced on the stage in varying moods of glorifica- tion and satire; and ultimately became entangled with the very threads of English life, for the combination of Garrick and Stratford produced a catalyst that precipitated the concepts of romanticism. $6.25 Syrian Politics and the Military 1945-1958 By Gordon H. Torrey Syria's entire life as an independent nation has been characterized by persistent internal turmoil, occasional near chaos, and continued governmental instability. Parliamentary government failed twice, once in 1949 and again in 1958, and the military dictatorship that was in power between 1949 and 1954 was also a failure. Mr. Torrey offers a careful analysis of the complex political and military maneuvers for power on the part of conservatives and radicals, civilians and the military, and pro- Western and pro-Soviet elements in the government between the establishment of independence in 1945 and the union with the UAR in 1958. $7.00 Explosive Forces in Latin America Edited by John J. TePaske and Sydney Nettleton Fisher Essays that deal with the possibilities inherent in the increasing polit- ical and social awareness in Central and South America. Their topics include Soviet policy in Cuba, the role of the intellectual in fomenting change, the military, land reform, the population explosion, "the culture of poverty/' the influence of the church, and the Alliance for Progress. $4.75 Ohio State University Press 164 West Nineteenth Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43210</page><page sequence="3">One Nation Indivisible The Union in American Thought, 1776-1861 By PAUL C. NAGEL. From the Revolution to the Civil War "the Union" was, in the words of Daniel Webster, "the all-absorbing topic of the day; on it all men write, speak, think, and dilate . . ." Today's differences about national power and states' rights show the protean vitality of the concept by which Americans have tried to define them- selves and their destiny. Professor Nagel's study - a permanent contribution to our intel- lectual history - follows its development during the nation's crucial formative period. $7.00 The Poetry of W. H.

Harvard Historical Monographs, 50. $7.50 Economic Growth in France and Britain* 1851-195O By CHARLES P. KINDLEBERGER In this important work, Mr. Kindleberger uses the economic his- tory of France and England over the past hundred years to test the adequacy of current theories of economic growth. Employing the comparative method to demonstrate the effective limits to theorizing, he concludes that economic growth is too complex a phenomenon to yield to partial explanations. His attack on the partial-equilibrium theories provides valuable materials for a gen- eral theory of growth. Coming in April. $8.95 In Search of JVealth and Power Yen Fu and the West By BENJAMIN I.

WALLACE WOODWORTH With his customary verve, Harvard's distinguished music teacher and historian wisely and critically discusses the ever-widening orbit of music in the 20th century and its influence on the lives of ordinary people. In this "age of the amateur," Mr. Woodworth surveys the state of music in America, calling attention to evils, dangers, problems, and current issues, and sets forth what seem to him the basic principles which must underlie any improvement in our situation, and govern the "pursuit of beauty" in American life.

Nearly all previous reprints have been based on the considerably weakened subsequent editions. The introduction by Ernst Mayr lists passages in the first edition that Darwin altered in later editions, points out instances in which Darwin was clearly pioneering, and calls attention to neglected passages that show Darwin as a much deeper thinker than has been recognized. Coming in April. $6.95 Diplomacy and Dogmatism Bernardino de Mendoza and the French Catholic League By DeLAMAR JENSEN In this first study of Mendoza, Spain's important Ambassador to France from 1584-1591, the author shows how Continental diplo- macy was dominated by religious zeal in the late 16th century, and how the fanaticism of the French religious wars formed a prelude to a reaction toward political absolutism. Professor Jensen draws on a fund of untapped manuscript and printed sources, including Mendoza 's coded letters, some of which he was the first to decipher. $6.95 Aesthetic Paganism in German literature From Winckelmann to the Death of Goethe By HENRY HATFIELD Sympathetic, but not uncritical, Mr. Hatfield interprets the litera- ture of the "Age of Goethe," the period between 1750 and 1830 when German literature flowered most richly, as largely reflecting a "pagan" vision of the world, freer, more beautiful, and more dignified than that of the Protestant orthodoxy of the time. Giving special attention to Goethe, Mr. Hatfield provides a perceptive, in- formative account of one of the chief phases of European intel- lectual development.
