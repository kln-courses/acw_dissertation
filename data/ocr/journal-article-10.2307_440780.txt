<plain_text><page sequence="1">VISION AND SYMBOL IN ALDOUS HUXLEY'S ISLAND DONALD J. WATT In their own soil those acres found The sunlight of a flowering weed; For still there sleeps in every ground Some grain of mustard seed. Aldous Huxley's last printed poem, "The Yellow Mustard" (1945), is an epitome of what he envisions as the process of salvation. As the poem opens, Huxley describes an expression- ist landscape where fields are "Cabined beneath low vaults of cloud. ... Like one wrapt living in his shroud,/Who stifles silently." The scene is like a "silent tomb" walled in by "Grey mountain-heaps of slag and stone." Through this dreary setting, "this em- blem of a mind/Dark with repinings," wanders the discouraged poet. But, surprisingly, a "sudden glory" catches his eye, "As though a single, conquer- ing ray/Had rent the cloudy sky." The "miracle of light" transfigures "that dull plain" into "one luminous field." Oddly, though, the poet observes that the clouds above are unbroken: "No loophole in the living air/Had let the glory through." The field of the mind, as it were, has found sunlight in its own soil: "For still there sleeps in every ground/Some grain of mustard seed." The crux of the poem is the realization that illumination comes from within. The grain of mustard seed represents that seed of goodness and insight which, Huxley insists, lies buried within the dark ground of in- dividual consciousness. The way to en- lightenment consists, not of some re- mote visitation from the sky, from outside the self, but rather of tilling the soil of one's individual soul. Salva- tion, Huxley's poem suggests, is a pro- cess of inward vision. Island (1962), Huxley's last novel, presents as many facets of his compre- hensive vision for man and community as he was able to commit to print be- fore his death in 1963. Julian Huxley recently revealed that his brother re- garded Island "as one of his major con- tributions to serious thought, and he was saddened and upset by the in- comprehension of so many of its re- viewers."' The book is Huxley's solemn and, in many ways, unique remedy for psychic atrophy and the specter of the bomb in the world of the 1960's. Hux- ley remarks on Island: "It's a kind of fantasy, a kind of reverse Brave New World, about a society in which real efforts are made to realize human potentialities. I want to show how humanity can make the best of both Eastern and Western worlds. So the setting is an imaginary island between Ceylon and Sumatra, at a meeting place of Indian and Chinese influence."2 Huxley conducts his probe toward an ideal society through a mixture of de- scription and symbolism which culmi- nates, as in Eyeless in Gaza, with an account of a visionary experience by the newly converted hero. I should like in the present article to describe some of the leading principles of Hux- ley's ideal community and to explore the implications of the book's major symbols in an attempt to sketch his final approach to the problem of exis- tence in the modern world. 149</page><page sequence="2">Plainly, Island is less a novel as such than any of Huxley's other novels. It is rather in the tradition of books like Gulliver's Travels, Rasselas, Erewhon and The Pool of Vishnu. Huxley's perfunctory attitude toward art in the later novels stems from his notion that art is not an end in itself: "By itself, art can never be completely redemp- tive. It can only point in the direction from which redemption comes.""3 In fine, art for Huxley became secondary to vision. Like Orwell in 1984 and Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451, Huxley had already recorded, in Brave New World and Ape and Essence, his alarm- ing visions of potentia 1 counter- Utopias. Now, in Island, Huxley out- lines his Utopian ideals. The plot of Island, consequently, is bare, clearly a simple vehicle for expressing Hux- ley's thought. Will Farnaby come to Pala posing as an innocent traveler but secretly hoping to obtain a con- tract for rights to the island's rich oil reserves. Farnaby, whom Huxley calls "the serpent in the garden,"4 forms an underhanded alliance with forces with- in and without Pala, even at the price of aiding and abetting the destruction of its Utopian community. While wait- ing for the seeds of his plot to ripen, however, Farnaby becomes more and more interested in the Palanesian way of life. Farnaby is "'the man who won't take yes for an answer' " but, exposed to the radiant happiness, good- ness and affirmation of Pala's inhabi- tants, he succumbs to their benevolence. Unfortunately, just as Farnaby is con- verted to Pala's mode of existence, military forces from neighboring Ren- dang seize the island and snuff out the ideal community. As Huxley noted while composing the novel, "I'm afraid it must end with paradise lost - if one is to be realistic.'6 The main point of the plot, then, is to introduce through Farnaby's guided tour of Pala a means of describing an ideal society. To begin with, Huxley's fairly com- plex vision stems from his conviction that any operative ideal would have to be based on a syncretic approach to the problem of existence. The need for an active synthesis of many di- verse elements is one of the funda- mental tenets of later H u x I e y a n thought: "Our disease has a multi- plicity of co-operating causes and is not to be cured except by a multiplicity of co-operating remedies."7 Nurse Ap- pu Radha stresses the need for a multi- plicity of remedies in Island in her recital of the rhyme in Chapter VI: 'I' am a crowd, obeying as many laws As it has members. Chemically impure Are all 'my' beings. There's no single cure For what can never have a single cause (p. 76). In the 1950's Huxley expands that "minimum working hypothesis" of Se- bastian in Time Must Have a Stop into a more inclusive vision of simul- taneous reforms. Huxley provides a clue to his expanding idealism in Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomor- row (1956) : "If you were able to com- bine Jung with F. W. H. Myers, and if you were then to enrich the product with the theories of Tantrik Buddhism and the practices of Zen, you would have a working hypothesis capable of explaining most, perhaps indeed all, the unutterably odd facts of human experience and, along with the hy- pothesis, a set of operational procedures by means of which its unlikelier ele- ments might be verified."s Among the varieties of Eastern mysticism, Mahaya- nist thought especially offered to Hux- ley an attractive religious base on which to erect a correlated synthesis. 150</page><page sequence="3">Huxley was evidently among the first of his critics to recognize that the mystical way of life could easily de- volve into pure escapism. In the 1950's he appears to have discovered a type of mysticism which insisted on in- volvement rather than detachment. In Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomor- row Huxley declares that "enlighten- ment is not for the Quietists or Puri- tans who, in their different ways, deny the world, but for those who have learned to accept and transfigure it" (p. 170). Huxley distinguishes care- fully the two main traditions of Hindu philosophy: the ancient Hinayana tra- dition, which taught total renunciation of the world and the quest for perpet- ual Nirvana; and the more recent Ma- hayanist tradition, which sought awak- ening through a responsible if delicate recognition of the world. In The Devils of Loudun Huxley protests: "For the Bodhisattva, according to the Maha- yanist tradition, the world obliterating ecstasies of the Hinayanist Sravaka are not realization, but barriers to realiza- tion."9 In Chapter VI of Island, Hux- ley emphasizes the notion that his religion accepts the phenomenal world in Ranga's explanation of the essential principle of Tantrik Buddhism: "'If you're a Tantrik, you don't renounce the world or deny its values; you don't try to escape into a Nirvana apart from life.... No, you accept the world, and you make use of it; you make use of everything that happens to you, of all the things you see and hear and taste and touch, as so many means to your liberation from the prison of yourself" (p. 85). One of the basic notions of recent Mahayanist teachings, bitterly contested by the older school, is the theory that anyone seeking true enlightenment must remain involved with the world: "The Mahayana stresses the necessity to help the world rather than merely abandon it, thus adding a touch of humanity and emo- tional warmth to the cold and stern doctrine of the Elders.'"10 In its toler- ance and flexibility, Mahayana offers enlightenment not only to the monk in isolation but to the layman in so- ciety as well. That branch of Eastern thought which Huxley pursued left him intellectual elbow-room to satisfy both his my stical and reformative urges. By its insistence on the power of contemplation, Mahayana exalts the individual capable of uniting with the Divine Ground. By its refusal to re- treat from the world, it invites the concerned critic to attempt to improve the conditions of humanity. Such a philosophy offered Huxley a founda- tion upon which to correlate his ideals in a number of areas into a theoretical- ly operative synthesis aimed at creating the good rather than the great society. One of Huxley's strongest ideals pro- moted in Island is the desire that West- ern and Oriental worlds accept and learn from each other. Farnaby asks if the teachers of the West could learn what Pala has learned. "'Why not,'" replies Mrs. Narayan in Chapter XIII, no change except that God would have to be thought of as immanent and man would have to be thought of as potentially self-transcendent' " (p. 258). The founders of modern Pala, the Scottish doctor and the Old Raja, joined forces to make the best of both worlds. As a result, Pala adopts En- glish culture and the English language, but practices the Buddhist religion and the Oriental art, of living. Like Rabindrath Tagore, Huxley believed as early as in Proper Studies (1928) that, "Compared with Western science, Western politics and morals are rudi- mentary" (p. 116). In Isla nd the 151</page><page sequence="4">Palanese wholeheartedly exploit the achievements of Western technology, but they derive their ethical standards from the East. The question of politics and government is treated rather vaguely. The island has a figurehead Rani, but internal affairs seem to be conducted by a core of policy-making wise men and administrators. The merger between East and West in Island is not defined exhaustively. Like most sweeping ideals, it eludes com- plete description. But the direction of the union is toward a Tagorist synthesis of Western progress with Eastern spirituality. An area in which such a merger ap- peared to Huxley eminently possible and desirable is that of psycho-sexual relationships between man and woman. In the "Epilogue" to The Devils of Loudun Huxley writes of a type of love idealized in India: "In India there is a Tantrik yoga, based upon an elab- orate psycho-physiological technique, whose purpose is to transform the downward self-transcendence of ele- mentary sexuality into an upward self- transcendence. In the West the near- est equivalent to these Tantrik prac- tices was the sexual discipline devised by John Humphrey Noyes and prac- ticed by members of the Oneida Com- munity" (p. 324). Pala's answer to slums and over-population is contra- ception and "maithuna," the yoga of love. Maithuna is Pala's name for what the Oneidans called Male Continence, a form of coitus reservatus. The Hux- ley version, though, exalts the method by adding "dhyana" or contemplation to the process. The point appears to be that the awareness in the sexual act is what turns the relation into yoga. For those who may not care for mai- thuna, Pala's government distributes Western mass-produced contraceptives which are, says Radha in Chapter VI, "'like education - free, tax-supported and, though not compulsory, as nearly as possible universal'" (p. 95). In Brave New World Revisited (1958) Huxley warns that the new age will not be the Space Age, but the Age of Over- Population. The result of the Palanese program, Ranga ascertains, is " 'that our population is increasing at less than a third of one per cent per an- num. Whereas Rendang's increase is as big as Ceylon's - almost three per cent. And China's is two per cent, and India's about one point seven' " (p. 90). Farnaby, representing the skeptic's re- action to the doctrine, manages to see "the whole thing as reassuringly ludi- crous. What shall we do to be saved? The answer is in four letters" (p. 89). Chapter XIII of Island outlines Hux- ley's ideals in the field of education. Farnaby concurs with Menon's con- tention that in America boys and girls exist for mass consumption, in Russia for strengthening the national state, arid in China for cannon fodder. But, Menon continues, in Pala they exist for "'actualization, for being turned into full-blown human beings"' (p. 236). Adolescents are taught not only, "'in their psychology and physiology classes, that each one of us has his own constitutional uniqueness,'" but also "'to experience their transcendental unity with all other sentient beings'" (p. 237). The ensuing recognition of human diversity leads to a recognition of the need for mutual forbearance and mutual forgiveness. Children are taught morality by animal analogies, compas- sion by erosion analogies: "'We shall be permitted to live on this planet only for as long as we treat all nature with compassion and intelligence. Elemen- tary ecology leads straight to elemen- 152</page><page sequence="5">tary Buddhism' " (p. 249). Pala teaches Elementary Practical Psychology as a method of "'liberating you from the hauntings of your own painful mem- ories, your remorses, your causeless anxieties about the future'" (p. 263). The goal of the technique, as Huxley suggests through Eyeless in Gaza, is to enable the subject to live only in the present, in the "now" of imme- diate awareness. Palanesian education attempts to "'reconcile analysis with vision'" (p. 238), the innumerable differentiating factors of existence with the one common cause. Menon pro- claims: "'What we give the children is simultaneously a training in perceiv- ing and imagining, a training in ap- plied physiology and psychology, a training in practical ethics and prac- tical religion, a training in the proper use of language, and a training in self- knowledge. In a word, a training of the whole mind-body in all its aspects"' (p. 243). What Huxley prescribes through the Palanese theory of educa- tion is a unified approach to reality and experience. Menon advises: "'Never give children a chance of imagining that anything exists in isolation'" (p. 247). Huxley's comprehensive mysti- cism is not just a Western retreading of Taoist ideology, but also a positive counterpoint to the problems of separa- tion, alienation and incommunication which he delineates in his other novels. Huxley always sought an ideal which would permit him to experience and express existence as an entity rather than a fragment, and the educative ideals of Island aim toward a similar objective for Everyman. Huxley also proffers a revised and ideal family system in Island. In Chap- ter VII S usila MacPhail describes Pala's answer to Western family prob- lems between children and parents: "'We all belong,' Susila explained, 'to a MAC - a Mutual Adoption Club. Every MAC consists of anything from fifteen to twenty-five assorted couples. Newly elected brides and bridegrooms, old-timers with gro wing children, grandparents and great grandparents - everybody in the club adopts every- one else. Besides our own blood rela- tions, we all have our quota of deputy mothers, deputy fathers, deputy aunts and uncles, deputy brothers and sisters, deputy babies and toddlers and teen- agers'" (p. 102). Pala's sociologists call the process "hybridization of micro- cultures" (p. 103). For the children, free to roam at will among the parents within their club, the system provides an outlet for discontent or irritation, an exposure to a wider variety of peo- ple and views, and an opportunity for greater self-expression. "'Mutual Adop- tion guarantees children against in- justice and the worse consequences of parental ineptitude," Susila informs Will. "'It doesn't guarantee them against discipline or against having to accept responsibilities' " (p. 104). For the parents and older deputies, the sys- tem provides "'healthier relationships in more responsible groups, wider sympathies and d e e p e r understand- ings'" (p. 103). Susila contrasts what she calls Will's kind of family with Pala's kind: As though reading instructions from a cookery book, "Take one sexually inept wage slave," she went on, "one dis- satisfied female, two or (if preferred) three small television addicts; marinate in a mixture of Freudism and dilute Christianity; then bottle up tightly in a four-room flat and stew for fifteen years in their own juice. Our recipe is rather different: Take twenty sex- ually satisfied couples and their off- spring; add science, intuition and hu- mor in equal quantities; steep in 153</page><page sequence="6">Tantrik Buddhism and simmer indefi- nitely in an open pan in the open air over a brisk flame of affection" (pp. 102-103). The result, according to Susila, is "'an entirely different kind of family' " (p. 103). Instead of the exclusive, com- pulsory family of Will's society, Pala creates an inclusive, liberated family. Evidently, Huxley feels that much of the physical bullying and psychological blackmail recurrent in a closed family life could be eliminated by such a pro- cedure as a MAC. Figures like Beavis in Eyeless in Gaza, Pordage in After Many A Summer Dies the Swan, Poole in Ape and Essence and Rivers in The Genius and the Goddess would have benefited immensely from a Mutual Adoption Club. One of the most striking practices of Pala is its widespread use of arti- ficial insemination to protect its in- habitants from hereditary disease and to improve the race. Vijaya tells Will in Chapter XII that "'we developed the techniques of AI about twenty years before you did. But of course we couldn't do much with it until we had electric power and reliable refrig- erators. We got those in the late twenties. Since then we've been using AI in a big way'" (p. 219). Shanta's parents had her and her brother by AI because her father's family displayed a history of recurrent diabetes. Vijaya and Shanta, since they already have a set of natural twins, plan to have their third child by AI "'to enrich the family with an entirely new physique and temperament'" (p. 218). Pala has "'a central bank of superior stocks'" from which to choose. "'In the early days,' " Vijaya tells Will, "there were a good many conscientious objectors. But now the advantages of AI have been so clearly demonstrated, most married couples feel that it's more moral to take a shot at having a child of superior quality than to run the risk of slavishly reproducing what- ever quirks and defects may happen to run in the husband's family. Mean- while the theologians have got busy. Al has been justified in terms of rein- carnation and the theory of karma. Pious fathers now feel happy at the thought that they're giving their wife's children a chance of creating a better destiny for themselves and their pos- terity" (p. 220). The notion of an artificial stock of babies perhaps at first recalls, disturb- ingly, the bottled babies of Brave New World. But the crucial difference, for Huxley, is that in the earlier novel the State completely and ruthlessly con- trolled production, whereas in Island the decision to try AI and the choice of the stock rests entirely with the parents. Pala's community is founded on the principle of the freedom and liberation of the individual and, in Huxley's vision, all the facets of the ideal society follow that principle. Huxley conveys to his readers some of his more difficult ideology in Island through an interesting use of symbol. In truth, the nature of Huxley's subject frequently requires a symbolic descrip- tion because many of his mystical pre- cepts elude 1 i t e r a I explanation. In Heaven and Hell (1955) Huxley apol- ogizes for writing of his mystical con- cepts analogously: "It is difficult, it is all but impossible, to speak of mental events except in similes drawn from the more familiar world of material things."11 In Time Must Have A Stop and The Perennial Philosophy, Huxley maintains that the mystical process it- self is neither expressible nor demon- strable except by direct personal experi- ence. As the teacher in Pala's Elemen- tary Applied Philosophy class says, "'What Buddha was implying and 154</page><page sequence="7">what Mahakasyapa understood was that one can't speak these teachings, one can only be them' " (pp. 253-54). Ac- cordingly, Huxley turns to a select but informing group of symbols in the novel in an attempt to suggest some of his more evasive mystical notions. The very title of the book, Island, suggests a pattern of symbolism latent in Huxley's thought for many years. As far back as 1924 Huxley ponders the problem of the isolation of the in- dividual as he describes Uncle Spencer: "He was imprisoned within himself. He was an island surrounded on every side by wide and bottomless solitudes ... he thought of all the millions and mil- lions of men and women in the world - all alone, all solitary and confined."'12 For Huxley in the 1920's existence seemed bewilderingly pluralistic; the world appeared to be inhabited by a group of irreconcilably heterogeneous individuals. Huxley seems never to have altered his belief in the multi- plicity and confusion of unmystical experiential reality. In Themes and Variations (1950) he observes that everyone is "an island universe of pri- vate experiences."'3" Through his con- version to mysticism, Huxley arrived at the conviction that while relativity and isolation were part of the human condition, they were not necessarily the sum total of human fate. As he as- serts in The Devils of Loudun, people "long to get out of themselves, to pass beyond the limits of that tiny island universe, within which every individ- ual finds himself confined" (p. 67). In Huxley's last novel, the mystical ideals of Pala and the implications of the title combine to suggest larger meanings for the symbol of people as islands. Farnaby relates the history of his aunt and uncle, Mary and Frank, in terms of isl 1 a n d symbolism. "'Two young people on their private Pala,' " he reflects aloud. "'Even outside of Pala one can find occasional islands of decency. Tiny little atolls, or even, every now and then, a full-blown Ta- hiti - but always surrounded by the Essential Horror' " (p. 274). The Es- sential Horror for Huxley is suffering and death. Frank died of gangrene after being struck by shrapnel in World War I, and many years later Mary died horribly from cancer. The Essential Horror overwhelmed Will by reducing first his dog, then Aunt Mary, and finally his mistress, Molly, into alien and repulsive packets of garbage. Each successive experience of the death of someone close to him drove Will ever more deeply into the island of his self, his phenomenal ego, confining him within "'an isolated consciousness, a child's, a boy's, a man's, forever isolated, irremediably alone" (p. 276). As a result, he feels safer without human contacts. He endorses a separative exis- tence and scoffs at a unity which will end inevitably in the Essential Horror. He rejects what the Palanese celebrate as "awareness" because he wants to be "'less aware of my own excellent health in an ocean of malaria and hookworm, of my own safely sterilized sex fun in an ocean of starving babies' " (p. 277). The unreformed Will is his own island. Like Huxley's other irreligious heroes, his only answer to pluralism is an at- tempt to erect a private haven of cynicism, sensuality and detachment. A more profound meaning under- lies Huxley's island symbolism in the novel, though, a meaning which, in its implications and its contacts with Palanese idealism, suggests a counter to Will's self-enforced isolation and escapism. Almost thirty years earlier Huxley comments on "The Individual" 155</page><page sequence="8">in Texts and Pretexts (1933): "Our successive states are islands - but, for the most part, 'sister islands linking their coral arms under the sea'.... But here and there, in midocean, rises some isolated peak; uninhabited, or peopled by races of strange men and unknown animals. .... Between these and the oceanic islands, there exists, no doubt, some obscure, submarine connection. If in no other way, they are at least united in this: that they rise from the crust of the same globe.""'4 Huxley at this time was groping for an answer to the atomistic appearance of experi- ence. In his later acceptance of a mysti- cal philosophy, he perceived that ex- perience, like humanity, was indeed anchored in a connective, submarine ground. The lesson that Island pro- pagates through Pala's subculture and the connotations of Huxley's symbol is that, although people are admittedly alone on the surface of routine life, like island s, they are nevertheless united, like islands, beneath the uneasy, oceanic flux. Through their contact with a common base, their submarine connection with a more permanent, subsurface reality, they are joined in a unitive psychic land which, for Hux- ley, is the mystical "Divine Ground." The cynic, whose vision is limited to "outsight," to the surface, sees only separation and isolation in a pluralistic universe. The mystic, who is capable of genuine insight, perceives a unity beneath the heaving, relativistic chaos, a unity which is far more real than the separation of surface reality. The sym- bolism behind Huxley's title is, in this way, functional to the Palanesians' emphasis on awareness and to Huxley's own mystical reading of life. Huxley also constructs a symbolic pattern in Island based on the ancient tradition of mountains as emblems of aspiration and achievement. Susila anticipates the pattern in Chapter IV when she uses word therapy to bring peace to the distraught Will. She brings his restless mind "'out of the hot plain . . effortlessly, into the freshness of the mountains'" (p. 35). Through Susila's therapy, the figurative mountains become Farnaby's refuge from disturbing, intrusive memories of Molly, from the guilt which haunts him from his past. But the physical mountains of Pala, in their service as an educational proving ground for the young climbers, assume a meaning more relevant to Huxley's brand of mysticism. Dr. Robert reports in Chap- ter X that scaling the precipices is, for the young, " 'an ordeal that helps them to understand the world they'll have to live in, helps them to realize the omnipresence of death, the essential precariousness of all existence'" (p. 185). Like Hemingway in A Farewell to Arms, Huxley suggests that simple retreat to the mountains does not auto- matically solve the problems of suffer- ing and death. Calamy, in Those Bar- ren Leaves, goes to a mountain for a place to purge himself of selfishness and worldly preoccupations. But in Island the climax of the youngsters' climb, their liberation through the worship in the temple, strengthens them for a return to the jungle below. After the hard physical and mystical struggle to the summit of openness, sunlight and perspective, explains Vi- jaya, comes the inevitable descent back to "'jungle life in all its exuberance and its rotting, crawling squalor . beauty and horror.... And then sud- denly, as you come down from one of your expeditions in the mountains, suddenly you know that there's a rec- onciliation . . beauty made one with 156</page><page sequence="9">horror in the yoga of the jungle'" (pp. 192-3). The jungle signifies life lived at the routine, everyday level of exis- tence. It is ugly and chaotic, terrifying and self-destructive. The mountains signify the peak of the curative, illu- minating mystical experience. It, in turn, is beautiful and unitive, uplift- ing and constructive. In Eyeless in Gaza Huxley uses images of cones in an ocean to etch the mystical process. In Island he uses references to mountains in a jungle to suggest the same process. In both novels, the guiding idea is the same: the individual should seek union with the "Godhead" through a close mental and physical discipline, but the resulting exaltation should provide a means of confronting, not an excuse for denying, external reality. Through his symbolism of the mountains and the jungle in Island, Huxley insists that the Mahayanist employment of contemplation and ecstasy does not constitute a Nirvana escapism. A less traditional symbol of some consequence appears in Chapter XIII. Here, Huxley describes the application of scarecrows in a field to Pala's stance on the notion of an anthropomorphic divinity. The scarecrows resemble homemade gods because, Vijaya de- clares, the Old Raja wanted the chil- dren to understand that "'it's we who pull their strings and so give them the power to pull ours .. and when any- one looks up, even at a god, he can hardly fail to see the sky beyond. And what's the sky? Air and scattered light; but also a symbol of that boundless and (excuse the metaphor) pregnant emp- tiness out of which everything, the liv- ing and the inanimate, the puppet makers and the divine marionette, emerges into the universe we know'" (p. 234). Empty space, explains Dr. Robert in Chapter X, is "'at once the most powerful symbol of death and the most powerful symbol of the full- est, intensest life . . . the Buddha Nature in all our perpetual perishing' " (p. 188). The scarecrows and the sky come to symbolize the diverse, tradi- tional, personal images of God behind which, in the "perennial philosophy," exists the universal consciousness com- mon to them all. The scarecrows and the sky serve to illustrate Huxley's be- lief, reiterated time and again after 1940, that there is a "Highest Common Factor" to all religions. In this sense, Huxley's angle of vision comprehen- sively embraces all religions as mani- festations of "the One." Island, like Eyeless in Gaza, ends with a vision by the repentant hero. Unlike that of Beavis, though, Farna- by's vision is stimulated by the moksha- medicine. Dr. Robert in Chapter IX describes the medicine as "'the reality revealer, the truth-and-beauty pill'" (p. 157) which enables even begin- ners in contemplation "'to catch a glimpse of the world as it looks to someone who has been liberated from his bondage to the ego"' (p. 158). The moksha-medicine in Pala is avail- able to anyone, although the uninitiated take it only under careful supervision. Huxley's serious quest for a "reality revealer" pill and his personal experi- ments toward a perfect vision-producer are among the more controversial items in his efforts to formulate a suitable mystical system of life for the masses.15 The goal of the perfect stimulant is total awareness of events and objects in the present, leading to the "awake- ness" of the contemplative mind in meditation. Huxley contends in To- morrow and Tomorrow and Tomor- row: "Total awareness opens the way to understanding, and when any given 157</page><page sequence="10">situation is understood, the nature of all reality is made manifest" (pp. 56- 57). Farnaby evidently experiences total awareness when, in the last chapter, he tries the moksha-medicine. At first, he feels undiluted identity with pure spirit: "Ultimately and essentially there was only a knowledgeless understand- ing, only union with unity in a limit- less, undifferentiated awareness" (p. 309). But, consistent with Huxley's thinking, Susila warns against indefi- nite immersion in delicious Nirvana, asserting, "'Bodhisattvas dilute their Nirvana with equal parts of love and work"' (p. 311). She puts on the Fourth Brandenburg Concerto, and Will feels that "tonight, for the first time, his awareness of a piece of music was completely unobstructed" (p. 312). He sees common objects in new ways charged with beauty and significance: "This breathing apocalypse c all e d 'table' might be thought of as a picture by some mystical Cubist, some inspired Juan Gris with the soul of Traherne and a gift for painting miracles with conscious gems and the changing moods of water-lily pads" (p. 317). Susila, however, constantly the modera- tor, wants also to call Will's attention to "'the still sad music of humanity'" (p. 318). She bids him to look down to the floor, at one of Tom Krishna's pet lizards: "A glow of sheer evil radiated from every gray-green scale of the creature's back, from its obsid- ian eyes and the pulsing of its crim- son throat, from the armored edges of its nostrils and its slit-like mouth" (p. 319). In Heaven and Hell Huxley cautions that the visionary experience may be terrifying as well as illumi- nating, pointing to Kafka, Van Gogh, Goya and Browning's "Childe Roland" as examples of visionary terror in art. Will witnesses with sheer horror the incident of the copulating praying mantises, as the female sedately chews off the male's head during the sexual act. Then the symbol of the Essential Horror, the hulking lizard, devours them both in a pantomime of pain, malice and insane violence. A succes- sion of frenzied mental scenes of cru- elty and imbecility remind Will that there is no escape from the real world, as squalid a jungle as it may be. As if to confirm the truth of his realization, Will then stands by helplessly while the forces of Rendang, led by Muru- gan, invade the island and murder Dr. Robert. The concluding pages of Island con- tain that ambivalent mixture of hope and despair which governs Huxley's final position. A passage of dogged hopefulness that enlightened man will not only endure but prevail keynotes Farnaby's last reflections: And always, everywhere, there would be the yelling or quietly authoritative hypnotists; and in the train of the rul- ing suggestion givers, always and everywhere, the tribes of buffoons or hucksters, the professional liars, the purveyors of entertaining irrelevances. Conditioned from the cradle, unceas- ingly distracted, mesmerized system- atically, their uniformed victims would go on marching and countermarching, go on, always and everywhere, killing and dying with the perfect docility of trained poodles. And yet in spite of the entirely justified refusal to take yes for an answer, the fact remained and would remain, remain everywhere - the fact that there was this capacity even in a paranoiac for intelligence, even in a devil worshiper for love; the fact that the ground of all being could be totally manifest in a flowering shrub, a human face; the fact that there was a light and that this light was also compassion (p. 334). 158</page><page sequence="11">In Island, Huxley's faith in the poten- tiality of man receives its clearest and most noble expression. Since Eyeless in Gaza Huxley was convinced that any improvement of existence in the modern world would have to begin with the individual. He believed that every individual has within him a la- tent fund of insight and compassion. HIe felt that a small but alert number of men, perhaps his own version of Milton's "few but fit," were capable of enlightenment without external aid. In a favorable environment, Huxley seems to have thought, this core of leaders would be able to assist large numbers of people in realizing their latent goodness and mystical potential. In Island, Huxley illustrates what could be done in a community if it were built on the premise of "goodness politics" rather than power politics. But the modern environment, by conditioning man to the worship of Mars and Mammon, prostitutes the dormant goodness of his nature to false values. A world obsessed with milita- ristic and materialistic values is blind to pacific and mystical values. "In the popular philosophy of our own time," Huxley notes during World War II, "it goes without saying that . . a minority of contemplatives is perfectly useless and perhaps even harmful to the community which tolerates it."16 Hux- ley's final position remains grudgingly realistic as he concedes regretfully that even the possibility of an independent contemplative community is quite re- mote in the world of the 1960's. As Farnaby listens to Murugan's ebbing procession, Huxley's resignation to modern rejection of his thought, to the refusal of mankind "to take yes for an answer," becomes apparent. Huxley's conclusion to Island is con- sistent with the advice from Aristotle with which he prefaces the novel: "In framing an ideal we may assume what we wish, but should avoid impossibil- ities." Huxley sought to frame an ideal knowing that its acceptance, perhaps even its tolerance, in a materialistic world was impossible, yet believing that its relevance to men as individuals was supremely real. And it is difficult not to wonder if Island is Huxley's final legacy to posterity, if somehow he hoped that someday the quest toward such an ideal on a more uni- versal scale would not be so far re- moved from reality. Huxley concludes his preface to a 1959 edition of his Collected Essays with a statement which is perhaps a summary of his life: "For the writer at least, and perhaps also for the reader, it is better to have tried and failed to achieve perfection than never to have tried at all.""17 Whatever posterity's final judgment of Huxley's achieve- ment may be, it will surely recognize his positive concern for that humanity which he so persistently scolds. It will clearly recognize the power and fore- sight of his vision, its continuing rele- vance in the middle 1960's and, we may safely assume, later. It will cer- tainly recognize his tireless quest for a new set of first principles in what he regarded as an unprincipled world. In Beyond the Mexique Bay (1934) Huxley quips, in a mutation of Vol- taire, "I11 faut cultiver notre oasis."18 It is perhaps one of Huxley's most creditable achievements that he culti- vates his oasis tellingly, and yet patrols unflinchingly into the wasteland prob- lems of scientific, economic and psy- chological reality in an intense effort to save mankind from itself. If he has failed in his attempt to achieve per- 159</page><page sequence="12">fection in his vision, the attempt itself was decidedly salutary. Huxley's sad fountain in one of his earliest poems, "The Garden" in The Burning Wheel (1916), would seem to be a fit symbol of himself as he frames his Utopian island almost fifty years later: There shall be seen the infinite endeavor Of a sad fountain, white against the sky And poised as it strains up, but doomed to break In weeping music.

Mrs. Laura Archera Huxley's recently published book about her late husband, This Timeless Moment: A Personal View of Aldous Huxley (New York, 1968), confirms Julian Huxley's re- mark: "Aldous was appalled . . . at the fact that what he wrote in Island was not taken seriously" (p. 308). Mrs. Huxley's memoir includes much information help- ful in understanding Island, especially her comments on dianetics and the "Art of Dying," two aspects of Huxley's vision which I do not discuss in detail in this essay. 2W riters at Work: The "Paris Review" Interviews (second s e r i e s; New York, 1963), p. 198. 3Themes and Variations (New York, 1950), p. 120. 4lnterviews, p. 199. 5lsland (New York, 1962), p. 18.

Huxley had insisted on a syncretic approach in Ends and Means. "The remedy for social disorder must be sought simultaneously in many different fields. ... We shall never succeed in changing our age of iron into an age of gold until we give up our ambitions to find a single cause for all our ills" (New York, 1937), pp. 10, 16. 8New York, p. 134. In Proper Studies Huxley announced that Jung seemed to him the most gifted of contemporary psy- chologists, whose "books on psychological types and on the unconscious are works of cardinal importance. . ... By comparison with Jung, most other psychologists seem either uninspired, unilluminating, and soundly dull, or else, like Freud and Adler, monomaniacal" (New York, 1928), p.

Island refer- ences to illustrate a lack of personal con- tact occur in Huxley's 1948 play, The Giaconda Smile, and in his essay on G. B. Piranesi's Prisons (1949). In the 1950's Huxley evoked imagery of people as islands with increasing frequency, especially in The Devils of Loudun (1952), The Doors of Perception (1954) and The Genius and the Goddess (1955).
