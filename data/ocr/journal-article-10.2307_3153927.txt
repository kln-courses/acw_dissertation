New York: Macmillan, 19o0. Pp. xvi + 452. $2.25. IN his first series of Gifford lectures' Professor Royce undertakes to lay the metaphysical foundations of his system of philosophy; in the series before us the principles earlier discovered are used to eluci- date a number of our deeper ethical and theological problems. In its dominant note the system may be described as a profound anthropomorphism. Not the outward trappings nor the transient phases of man, but his essential and permanent characteristics, are searched out by many devices of ingenious and scholarly scrutiny, and then this sublimated essence is generalized and asserted to be the very heart and core of universal reality. Man is a Self, a being with a unique purpose; and only selves are real. But man is also in essence a person, a moral self that consciously strives to find its ideal and real- ize it, and that includes within its being other lesser selves, some of them non-moral. And God also is a person, the person of persons, whose essence it also is to strive and to include other selves, indeed all selves, among them men, the selves of larger scope that include men, and countless others; e.g., as Professor Royce tentatively suggests, the selves hinted to us in animal species and by inorganic nature. But this does not exhaust the essence of God. In addition to striving he attains his ideals, among them the ideal of knowledge. In addition to self-consciously experiencing and understanding the whole of the x See this JOURNAL, Vol. V, No. 2 (April, IgoI), pp. 328-30.</page><page sequence="2">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE 533 strivings of all his included selves, which are also his strivings, he also experiences and appreciates their and his attainment-he views the universe, and he views it totum simul, in one eternal moment. And, coming to more practical problems, the freedom of man and of other finite selves is genuine as far as it goes, though by no means unlimited. The kind, the universal aspect of the purpose of each self, is wholly determined by others from without, but what unique and individual embodiment this purpose shall have is determined from within by the free choice of the self concerned. Thus every finite self is largely, but not wholly, determined; while God, the All-inclusive, having none without him, is wholly free. Again, the life of man and of other "ethical individuals" is immortal or unending. For, that every purpose finds fulfilment is fundamental for Professor Royce, and a moral purpose ever demands new embodiments, as each oncoming situation presents new duties to keep alive the purpose of a moral self in infinitum. Of course, this doctrine compels the author to deny that death is the end of man. But how he substantiates this position it is impossible so much as to hint, in default of space to suggest his theory of nature, as a system of non- material selves of broader scope, inclusive of man among other selves. Both theories are very interesting and original, and, together with the reconciliation of evil with the divine perfection, call forth some fasci- nating discussions. This must serve to suggest, most inadequately, the mere framework of Professor Royce's system. The consideration that it takes into account only human reason and its implications affords the justifica- tion for calling it anthropomorphic. And the further consideration that for the author our reason is but a special form of purposeful activity, which he would admit to be a product of evolution, destined, in all probability, to be superseded by some higher type of activity, with its higher form of reflection- this consideration proposes a question to Professor Royce, which he and others have proposed to Kant. How, namely, does he know that our present type of reason is to remain unmodified; how does he know that it will not give place to, say, an angelic reason, whose implications will picture a very dif- ferent universe ? But whether the author's conception be logically compulsory or merely a hypothesis, the marvelous consistency of its rich content, its frank and sympathetic attitude toward opposed views and awkward facts, an empirical basis unusually solid for a meta- physical theory, together with its excellent literary form, unite in</page><page sequence="3">534 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY assuring it a broad and deep influence on philosophic and theological thought.
