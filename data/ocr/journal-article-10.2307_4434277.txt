ABSTRACT In this article, I have chosen to focus upon two particular representations of the god Siwa from both Central and East Java-Siwa the Majestic Great God and Siwa the Teacher. Through a discussion of these image types I am attempting to weave a narrative of the Javanese past in which the objects are indicative of the singularity and flu- idity of the human religious experience. These two spe- cific representations of the god Siwa in the art of classical Java are connected with Javanese religious thought as articulated in indigenous textual material, embracing the present and present-day perceptions of the Indonesian past. I examine how the creation of a typology of images is problematic due to the rigidity of categories, and in so doing I argue that style cannot be separated from the interpretive element. The representation of the male body in Javanese art is also briefly considered. This article is based on recent research on images of Siwa from Java.' However, this study does not relate the discovery of hitherto unknown images and there- fore it does not offer a new interpretation of Javanese images of Siwa on that basis.2 Rather, through a self- reflexive engagement with the research, I critically examine how to interpret Javanese images of Siwa and how the Javanese past is reconstructed. The main concern of my research is to see how images of Siwa can be reconnected with their religious context, from which they have been divorced, by pay- ing greater attention to Javanese religious textual mate- rial and looking at the relationship between texts and images. In doing so I have revisited established icono- graphic classifications. This focus on textual material is expected to be complemented by an archaeological study of the sites with which the images are associ- ated, when that is possible. Scholars such as Gregory Schopen have indicated the importance of connecting the study of Buddhist texts with the archaeological study of Buddhist sites, and more recent work on early Indian art has used landscape archaeology to reevalu- ate the sculpture from the Sanchi site.3 Most of the work on classical Indonesia has not differentiated between art history and archaeology, which have been used as a combined tool in the study of religious structures.4 The overemphasis and overdependence on written texts, which has been *wU .Z Il. 181</page><page sequence="3">criticized in the context of the study of Indian reli- gions, especially Buddhism, and the consequent impact of such a dependence on Indian art-histori- cal writing are not a problem found in art-historical writing focused on classical Java. On the contrary, here the role of indigenous textual material in recon- structions of the religious background seems to have been underplayed; this is certainly so in the case of Siwa images and Saivism. Thus one of the aims of the research was to recontextualize Siwa and present the cult and iconography of Siwa in its local form as it pertains to Javanese religion, through a reevaluation of relevant Javanese textual material. In the course of the research a number of issues problematized the classification process and required that the assumption of neutrality of classification be explicitly questioned. In addition, dating images and objects and searching for a chronological order that would reveal an evolutionary progression were not seen as the principal goal of research of this kind as often still understood to be the case in writings dealing with the art of classical Java.5 Development and progression are assumptions reflecting ways of thinking about the past; these assumptions reveal the relationship of the present with the past and the con- struction of what the archaeologist Michael Shanks has called "a past as wished for": "We all produce a 'past as wished for' in the sense of pasts which we find empirically, theoretically, aesthetically and archaeo- logically 'satisfying."' 6 In this article, I have chosen to focus upon two par- ticular representations of the god Siwa from Java - Siwa the Majestic Great God and Siwa the Teacher. Through a discussion of these image types I am attempting to weave a narrative of the Javanese past in which the objects are indicative of the singularity and fluidity of the human religious experience. IMAGES: RELIGIOUS TEXTS, INSCRIPTIONS, AND TEMPLE SITES Why are there representations of the god Siwa in Java? Saivism traveled to Java with a mixed back- ground. We know that Siwa is a Hindu god whose cult was imported from India, as a result of what at one time was referred to as the "Hinduization" of the Indonesian islands and was later called "localization of Indian influence."7 The impetus to adopt Indian religions has been seen by historians as being moti- vated principally by local rulers' desire to legitimize kingship: the Indian religions gave them the means to acquire greater power and /or to consolidate it.8 Neither the "Indianization" nor the "localization of Indian influence" theory have been satisfactory in explaining the "India-Java axis."9 The theory of "Indianization" of Indonesia and Southeast Asia served a purpose during the colonial era, just as the "localization of Indian influence" did in the post- independence period. So is the attempt to see some kind of cosmopolitanism linking South and Southeast Asia, particularly in the sense of the Sankrit cosmopo- lis theorized by Sheldon Pollock:`0 a "past as wished for" influenced by contemporary ideas of global net- works and the spread of English as an international lingua franca. I will, however, leave aside all questions of origin of Javanese Siwa cults, preferring not to engage with the overly debated issue of Indian influ- ence on ancient Indonesian culture. It is a topic for another article and one that needs to be considered in the light of how it relates to present-day constructions of the Javanese past. Siwa worship seems to have enjoyed popularity in Indonesia over a period of more than seven centuries. The existence of locally fashioned images associ- ated with temple sites and also of early inscriptions referring to lingga installation and the existence of a number of locally composed texts in Old Javanese, of various dates, from about the tenth century, dealing with the worship of Siwa, can be taken as evidence that a cult identified as Siwa worship by its practitio- ners lived on for a number of centuries. In many ways the cult of Siwa is still alive. Siwa worship is part of Balinese Hinduism,'" and Saiwa Tantric influences can be found in kebatinan or kejawen (Javanese mysti- cism; literally "the religion of Java")). 2 Judith Becker has highlighted the impact of Saiwa Tantric cults on the artistic practices of Javanese courts through her study of the twentieth-century mystical musical (D :n m .t 12</page><page sequence="4">treatise Wedha Pradangga Kawedhar (Knowledge of Gamelan Revealed)."3 At a more popular level, Siwa provided a new identity for the local gods, whose characteristics were seen to parallel one or another of the god's composite aspects. It would be simplistic, however, to perceive the presence of Siwa in Java and, more widely, in Indonesia, only in this light. The presence of literature in the Saivite mold, from Java, very broadly coeval with the images, reveals greater complexity and allows for a study of the religious background of Javanese images of Siwa that takes into account Javanese sources. Thus one can begin to engage with the issue of who made the images and why. I cannot claim (very far from it) to have been able to make complete sense of the textual material, which is truly vast.'4 Texts to be considered are as diverse as literary compositions, such as some of the best known kakawin (Arjunawiwaha [Arjuna's Wedding] is a case in point) and other works that deal more specifically with the exposition of doctrine. The latter are catego- rized by the experts as tutur, prose works of religious content. This type of literature is known to us mostly through Bali, where tutur have been composed by the hundreds and relate more specifically to Balinese reli- gion. Some of these tutur were, however, also known in Java, and it is very likely that tutur writers were active in ancient Java, alongside composers of kakawin and kidung. To the literary genre of tutur belong the "clas- sic" works - "classic" in the sense that this is how they are viewed in present-day reconstructions of their religious import -that present an exposition of Saiwa religion in ancient Java. Of these the main ones are: Wrhaspati Tattwa (The Doctrine of Reality of Wrhaspati), Ganapati Tattwa (The Doctrine of Reality of Ganapati), Sang HyangTattwajhana (The Revered Knowledge of the Doctrine of Reality), Sang HyangMahajiana (The Revered Great Knowledge), Wratisasana (The Precepts of the Ascetic), Bhuwana Kosa (The Sphere of the Inhabited World), Bhuwana Sangksepa (The Quintessence of the World), and Jnainasiddhanta (The Knowledge of Saiwa Siddhanta). To this list one should add an exceptional kakawin, Dharma Sanya (The Philosophy of the Void), a religious and philosophical work in verse that has received greater attention only in more recent years." The dates of these texts are not known with any preci- sion, except perhaps for JInanasiddhanta, a Balinese rather than Javanese text in the form known to us today, which Jan Gonda places around looo.'6 The above-mentioned Dharma Suinya, also regarded as a Balinese work, is thought to be Majapahit.'7 The way this textual material relates to the images and their iconography is not immediately obvious. Siwa worship is a complex phenomenon, shrouded in secrecy. But even with such shortcomings, an over- view of the religious literature involved highlights the conceptual background of the images and allows for a refinement of interpretive techniques. What transpires from a reading of this vast material is that Javanese Saivism seemed to have been an independent synthe- sis of different Saiwa teachings, from Pasupata -for the presence of which Max Nihom has argued,"8 to Saiwa Siddhanta -the latter not, however, akin to South Indian Saiva Siddhanta."9 Textual sources may allow us an insight into the thinking of the people who fashioned the images, but the inscriptions connected with sites where images were found can tell us more precisely about the his- torical context. Inscriptions do not inform us on doctrine; however, they often make indirect reference to Siwa worship, for example through the mention of specific mythological episodes connected with the god, which may be used as metaphors for royal prowess. Their vocabulary needs to be scrutinized for it may be full of ambiguities. However, such indi- rect references are still very significant20 and point to acquaintance with a specific body of religious knowledge. The architectural context of images is important for establishing their ritual function. Information about the original physical context of the images is unfortunately far too often missing and impossible to retrieve, as the objects we see today have by and large been removed from their original location, with no record of their provenance. However, there are still a number of images in situ, such as the ones at the .a . . 183</page><page sequence="5">Prambanan complex, a number of linggas also in situ, and relief representations, including the Siwa from Jago's Arjunawiwaha relief series in East Java. To these we need to add the knowledge derived from an archaeological study of the sites, in par- ticular in terms of a sacred landscape, with the sites viewed by way of their relationship with one another, as components of this overall sacred landscape." We may then begin to obtain a more complete pic- ture. Postprocessual approaches to archaeology have emphasized a concept of landscape as a "lived context which is experienced from the position of the human being,"22 bringing back people and their move- ments - human agency- into the empty landscapes of structuralist approaches, which have dominated Indonesian archaeology to date: This has resulted in a more reflexive model which recognises the interactive relationship between people and buildings.... Of particular concern in these recent studies has been the ways in which the physical layout of ritual sites may have helped to maintain behaviour and ideological regularity, especially through the control and restriction of vision and bodily movements.23 Thus we see a complex relationship emerge among texts, epigraphic records,24 the images themselves, their immediate architectural context, and the sacred landscape to which the images belong, through the sites with which they are associated. It is only by look- ing at the way these different elements relate to each other, bringing the focus back on human agency, that we begin to make sense of the wider context - reli- gious and sociohistorical. SIWA THE MAJESTIC GREAT GOD In this and in the following section, I shall focus on the image types of Siwa Mahadewa and Siwa Guru and their iconographic features. The iconography of the images in question has been examined in great detail in a prodigious output of scholarly writ- ings for well over a century. Through these writings, archaeologists and art historians -primarily writ- ing in Dutch, due to the colonial past of Indonesia, but roughly from the time of the Second World War publishing in English, Bahasa Indonesia, and other languages - have classified all extant Javanese images and arranged them into set types. These writings con- stitute the present body of iconographic knowledge.25 Newly discovered images, if any, are always compared with these existing types, and they are classified and named accordingly. In my work I have related to this existing typology in a critical way, attempting a reclassification based on a new reading of the formal iconography of the images considered. This new reading was prompted by my engagement with the religious textual mate- rial. But my reclassification is not, in any way, posited as fixed. As I shall further elaborate, classifications should be kept sufficiently flexible, for they are based on interpretation, and while some may be more useful in certain contexts, they may be useless in others. The first image type I shall consider is Siwa as the Majestic Great God or Siwa Mahadewa. The Jinanasiddhanta (TuturAdhyatmika) describes Mahadewa as one of the saptadewata, the seven dei- ties. This designation is to be seen as part of a series of interlinked levels on the way to liberation, with the lowest level of atma corresponding with the lowest level of dewata and so on. Mahadewa corresponds to niratma, the aksara 0 and the turyapada state. The Jnhnasiddhanta describes him as follows: he is niritma; the seven openings of the body (eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth) are his dwelling place; he is yel- low in color; and he is the originator of the world. He is fourth in the list.26 Mahadewa is also part of the nawasangga, the Nine Great Gods, occupying different cardinal directions, and in that scheme he rules West.27 Other charac- terizations of Mahadewa are found in a number of literary works, some of which may describe him in negative terms.28 Extant images of Mahadewa are not necessarily linked with the whole range of these con- trasting conceptualizations, nor is it always possible to match them exactly, but it helps to be aware of this multivocality. They are a "solid metaphor," and poly- semy is what underlies them as "solid metaphor."29 Cl) CD CN :l .%) LL 84</page><page sequence="6">In Java (both Central and East Java, but more frequently in Central Java), Mahadewa is shown standing in samabhanga, with a straight back, the weight equally distributed on the feet (fig. i). There are representations of seated Siwa also conventionally referred to as Mahadewa (fig. 2). I prefer to separate the standing Mahadewa from the seated Siwa, as I feel that the seated Siwa is not Mahadewa (bearing in mind, of course, that Siwa is Mahadewa and Guru and everything else simultaneously and all the time). Mahadewa seems to embody the Majestic Lord Siwa, Siwa as a kingly god, whereas seated Siwa is seen in his meditative, yogic aspect. I shall discuss these images in greater detail in the next section. The main laksana of Mahadewa, by which I mean the customary distinctive marks or attributes, are given as: camara (fly whisk), aksamala (rosary of beads), padma (lotus flower), and kamandalu (water jar). The camara is understood, in the established body of iconographic knowledge, to be linked with purification. The aksamala is a rosary sometimes made of small skulls. The kaman.dalu is said to sym- bolize asceticism. These attributes are not necessar- ily present in all images, nor are they always held in the same hands. Among the hand gestures (mudra), most frequently seen is the yogamudra (also known as dhydaiamudra, one hand over the other, palms facing upward). The hasta (hand and arm gesture) most fre- quently seen are varadahasta (bestowing gesture) and abhaya (do-not-fear). There are variations in terms of which hand carries what or performs a particular hasta or mudra. Directions for the hasta may vary, and it is important to remember that a change of direc- tion should not be taken to mean we are seeing a dif- ferent hasta. There are several mudra and hasta seen especially among East Javanese images that cannot be easily identified.30 Another important laksana is the candrakapala or ardhacandrakapala, which is worn on the head. This is a moon or half-moon with a skull placed either over the j4tamakuta, a crown placed under a topknot, or a kiritamakuta, a tall diadem crown or headdress. An optional laksana is the trinetra, third eye, not seen in all Mahadewa images. A trisula (trident) may be 1 Siwa Mahadewa, Central Java, silver. National Museum, Jakarta.

The dress varies according to the region (Central or East Java) and may reflect aristocratic fashion. In Central Javanese images we see what can be described as a thin kain cloth wrapped around the lower half of the body, usually plain. Occasionally a second kain can be seen, which may be made of tiger skin, as in the Mahadewa from Candi Banon (fig. 3), in the Borobudur area, now in the National Museum in Jakarta. When the kain is decorated, the motifs seen are lines (garis), kawung (a type of batik cloth pat- tern), and arabesque-like figures. In East Java, Mahadewa is seen with two or three belts or waist cloths (ikatpinggang), an uncal (tassel), and a sampur (sash) tied from right to left around the waist, shaped like a fan. East Javanese images are almost weighed down by the richness of dress and adornment. The physical body of Siwa disappears, and the sumptous decorative clothing and rich jewelery seem actively to refer to authority and power (fig. 4). Mahadewa may wear an upaw7ta ular, a snake- shaped upawita (brahmanical cord),3" or a jewel-like long upawrta and can be seen, in Central Java, stand- ing next to or seated on his wahana (vehicle), the bull Nandi. His jewelery varies. As earrings he wears vari- eties of kundala (ear ornaments). He wears hara or kalung (necklace), keyura (arm bracelets), and kank- ana (round ornaments that can be worn over wrists or ankles), and he may wear snakes coiled round the arms. The height of the images varies, and I suggest variations in height are related to their place within the candi (temple). Having examined a variety of Mahadewa images in the course of three field trips to Indonesia (1998, 1999, and 2000), I asked myself how the Javanese Mahadewa compares with parallel images from other regions. Comparison with Indian images seemed to be relevant. Engaging in this comparison had a point, for it helped to highlight what is peculiar about Javanese Mahadewa and what distinguishes it from other images of the god manufactured elsewhere. The first thing that strikes us is that there is no exact equivalent image in India. Indian Siva is generally addressed as Mahadeva by devotees, but Siva is primarily known as Mahesvara (Great Lord) in the Sanskrit texts. As Mahesvara or Mahesamuirti, Siva in India is described in relevant iconographic texts such as Silpasastra (The Canonical Book of Sculpture) as three eyed, with jatamakuta, four armed and on a padmapqtha or padmasana (pedestal), carrying parasu (ax) and mrga (deer, symbol of pasu), and performing abhaya and varada, the gesture of protection and bestowing. Images of Mahesamuirti as such are relatively uncommon. The best known is from Elephanta, and this type of image is possibly related to Javanese rep- resentations of Siwa Trisiras.32 Mahesvara manifests himself in different forms, seated or standing, riding upon vehicles, as terrific (ugra) or pacific (saumya). cn C14</page><page sequence="8">1-0 ft x 'Al Af Jw; IV A ?

The Javanese Mah dewa seems to be a reinterpretation, in a novel form, of the concept of Siwa as the Great Lord/God. The cdmara is a Javanese elaboration in the iconography of Siwa and not specific to the Mahadewa representations, as will be seen, though it must be pointed out that in India the camara may be seen with Svarnakarsana Bhairava, according to the Visnudharmottarapurana, a Sanskrit work that discusses the arts.33 What we are thus wit- nessing is an overall phenomenon of transposition, which is not in itself indicative of ignorance of given iconographic precepts34 but may simply represent a conscious reformulation to infuse a majestic form (Mahadewa) with more esoteric religious meaning. The camara is a reference to cleansing, and as such it connects to the ascetic practices involving ablutions, also referred to by the kamandalu, in keeping with what the Javanese (Saiwa) religious literature dis- cusses in connection with tapa, asceticism.35 SIWA THE TEACHER Siwa the Teacher is Siwa Bhatara Guru (Lord Teacher), that is, Siwa when one thinks of him as teacher. Once again it must be reiterated that this is not a very clear-cut category. Saivism postulates a series of realities from the highest absolute to the vis- ible -realities, incidentally, that are inner, accessible through meditation practice, centered on one's own body. A manifestation of Siwa rules over each real- ity, and Bhatara Guru is Siwa manifesting himself in the visible reality. Siwa is the Supreme Yogi, and it is through yogic discipline36 that one can reach the high- est reality. The discipline is taught by Siwa himself (or a guru who "is" Siwa). Thus Siwa is Bhatara Guru as he is simultaneously Mahadewa, Sadasiwa, as he is also Sang Paramartha (The Highest). I am keen to distinguish between Siwa Guru and Agastya even though the two are often conflated and thought, in secondary sources, to be one and the same. In view of my above remarks on simultaneous identities, this view is theoretically acceptable, but the image is usually described as a composite image type, a hybrid, with no further engagement with the religious context of the image that has in the first instance given rise to this supposed hybridity. Agastya is a guru in human form, a human manifestation of Siwa, and as such images of Agastya have a place in CY CD Vu C.4 sv) m :L 88</page><page sequence="10">Siwa temples.37 Agastya is, strictly speaking, a rsi, in other words a sage, a guru who is, ultimately, Siwa. I base my typology of Siwa Guru and Agastya on Le. Poerbatjaraka,38 who, on the basis of his reading of primary source material, went to great lengths to demonstrate that Agastya and Bhatara Guru were not quite the same.39 Siwa Guru is distinct, and that is why there are some problems in understanding the identity and possible location of the Siwa images in a sitting position, referred to earlier, usually named Mahadewa in museum classifications and catalogues.40 In my view, the category of Siwa the Teacher ought to comprise such images, mostly from Central Java, especially Dieng (but the bronzes can be from other areas in Central Java and also later than Dieng, as seen in fig. 2). They represent Siwa seated in a medi- tative posture, which is variedly described by writ- ers as v7rdsana or vajrasana or even padmasana, but more simply called svastikasana (crossed legs) by T. A. Gopinatha Rao.4" The god wears hardly any adorn- ment and may have either two or four arms, in which case he is holding an aksamala and a camara, with the two primary arms usually in dhy@zamudra at the front, often with a lotus placed on the upturned palm. An ardhacandrakapala is placed in his locks. The example illustrated in figure 5 has a different hand gesture, the siwalingga, which explicitly refers to the abstract form of Siwa, the lingga. The Siwa the Teacher category, in the way it is understood today, also accommodates images of Siwa as a young, rather emaciated ascetic, two armed, car- rying a kamandalu, sporting a small beard, dressed with a simple cloth, with a trisula either in his hand or sculpted at the back of the stele. However, rather than thinking of such images as young Agastya without the characteristic potbelly, or as a generic Siwa Guru type, I propose, in a slightly more radical interpreta- tion, that these should be seen as Saiwa Rsis or human ascetics. There is very little in terms of contextual clues for such images, of which there are only a few, all from Central Java, but this interpretation seems to be more in keeping with the iconography of the images and the emphasis given in Saiwa religious writings to the figure of the Rsi (fig. 6) 5 tiwa the Teacher (conventionally classified as Siwa Mahadewa), Central Java. Musee Guimet, Paris. The hands show .iwalingga. Once again comparison with parallel Indian statuary may be helpful to highlight difference and affinity. The Indian equivalent of the seated Siwa Guru (Mahadewa in current writings) is Siwa Yogadaksinamuirti. This equivalent image is conceptu- ally close to the Javanese. Rao gives the iconographic precepts, culled from Sanskrit texts, for several vari- ants. None of these is entirely similar to the Javanese one, but the affinity, down to the presence of an aksa- mala, is undeniable, especially when one considers what Rao calls the "first mode of representation" of Yogadaksinamuirti.4" We have no real indication as to what posi- tion the images just discussed would have had in the architectural context of a candi, as they are not found in situ and we are thus unable to say whether in the case of the seated Siwa Guru, the injunction k 189 IZ .Wt 113</page><page sequence="11">, , fiZ. *;r* A,&gt; j . ff i * S g _ 5? s J- w . :C. . . . : :~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. .. .. . .. .. .. .

Through this survey-based method art historians and archaeologists have also thought it might be pos- sible to identify stylistic links, with style understood to be an objective property, and to establish a chronology by looking at styles and drawing comparisons." This approach is problematic. Let us reflect for a moment on how one would usu- ally classify, in keeping with the above prescriptions of sample survey combined with meticulous noting of frequency of features.45 The sorting of objects such as Siwa statuary may be done to establish whether the objects of the group sample considered (for example, the Siwa statuary from Dieng) have a spe- cific ritual function, and thus the images are grouped and regrouped accordingly. Establishing whether an image is a freestanding sculpture part of a group of sculptures from a specific site, or a relief part of the same narrative sequence, is also a constituent of these initial classifications related to determining function. But already we run into problems with this approach, because the ritual function can be only partially ascer- tained, if at all, due to the difficulties one encounters in reconstructing an architectural context for any free- standing image that is not found in situ; therefore the ritual function is often only an assumption. Moreover, ritual functions may overlap with other functions, and this possibility needs to be taken into account. In parallel to this function-based classification, after establishing what iconographic elements are consistently frequent and consistently similar, follow- ing a division of the surveyed images into groups, one begins to engage with considerations of variations in style within a specific group, primarily to establish a chronology.' It has been quite usual to see style and function as separate, with classifications never under- stood to be intersecting, except at the level of grand C190</page><page sequence="12">theorizing. But here we have another problem. This separation is not clear cut, and it is artificial. We can look at style as "material style," that is, the pattern- ing in material artifacts, or as a "way of doing," which would include ideas, decisions, and practices. These conceptions are not exclusive. There is and there needs to be a constant shift in the way they are used in the context of an analysis. Michael Shanks suggests that material culture is production or design and that the style of an artifact is not an expression or an attribute but "the means by which objects are constituted as social forms."47 Thus it no longer seems feasible to adopt art style as the unit of analysis and fix the art styles of ancient Java into stylistic types, as has been done in most previous studies.48 Interpretation, in other words, cannot be separated from the identification of similarity and dif- ference within a typology.49 In the work I have carried out, I do have types. These are posited as very flexible, temporary analytical categories. Consistency is what I have been striving for in creating these categories, but they are not rigid. In my typology, I have the following types, drawn from the religious literature I have acquainted myself with: Siwa Mahadewa (Siwa the Majestic God), Siwa Guru (Siwa the Teacher), Agastya (the Teacher who is Siwa incarnated as human teacher), Nandiswara (the door guardian who is Siwa), Mahakala (the door guardian, swallower of the universe), Lingga (Siwa's phallus), Ardhanariswara (Siwa who is half-male-half-female), Hari-Hara (Wisnu and Siwa as one), Trisiras (three- headed Siwa), corresponding to what are known from the said religious literature as aspects or manifesta- tions of the god. But though I am separating Siwa Mahadewa or Agastya from Siwa Guru for the practical purpose of temporary classification, it does not follow that they should be seen or were at any time perceived as wholly distinct, as the typology suggests. This distinction is often assumed when the images are subsequently related to their religious and socio-historical context in broader historical accounts attempting to recon- struct a historical past -in this specific instance, as noted earlier, with the additional complication of pos- iting Javanese Siwa Guru as a hybrid. As said, concep- tually Siwa is Mahadewa even when he is Guru, and this is so regardless of whether he is depicted standing or seated or in any other position or wearing any gar- ment or attire. The artificial nature of typologies and the need for keeping them flexible can be exemplified by the way Trisiras (three-headed Siwa) is thought of. Trisiras can either be taken as a representation of Mahesa show- ing Siwa as the pacific god (Tatpurusa), the terrify- ing one (Aghora-Bhairawa) and the female principle (Wamadewa-Sakti), or as Trimuirti (Brahma-Wisnu- Siwa), thus interpreting the religious or philosophical import of the image differently, creating yet more types50 and establishing a different doctrinal content on the basis of the art-historical or archaeological classification. In other words, by taking typologies as flexible analytical categories and by supporting them with a reading of religious textual material, I am not separating classification from context. There are, of course, other interpretive strategies that allow for further contextualization, which I have not explored and which will complement my own. In showing that a classification is an act of creative interpretation, I am trying to go beyond the separation of objective/subjective, referring to newer discourses in archaeology that have not yet had much impact on the archaeology of classical Indonesia.5 I am here attempting to question entrenched positions. How, then, do I describe these images? What ele- ments do I consider important to convey the nature of the images as representations of the god Siwa? I have used the following categories to record the character- istics of the images: form and shape, (approximate) size, provenance, location, ornamentation, adorn- ment, dress, posture, gesture, attribute. I have left out precise dating on purpose. Dating is something that should be seen in context, as one of the different types of information relating to the images rather than the most important element of their classifica- tion. Thus it can be added, omitted, or left open- ended, depending on the use one wishes to make of the classification. f. . X4 ) c:s 191</page><page sequence="13">SIWA'S BODY: THE MALE BODY IN JAVANESE ART Posture and gesture are important in my classification and typology. I see them as important because they allow us to focus on the physical and symbolic body of Siwa. They can be seen as encoding information relating to nonverbal communication of an abstract nature. Through them the body can be treated as a category worthy of historical investigation. The body of Siwa is a representation of the Javanese male body, shown with an "idealized" naturalism -idealized in the sense that it did not necessarily correspond to a real, specific physical type but that it represented an aestheticized view of the male body, informed by awareness of the yogic body (by which I mean the body possessed of a yogic "habitus")52 and articulated in multiple artistic idioms, more specifically related to time and location.53 In Siwa's images there is a constant shift between the human dimension of the representation and the one symbolic of the divine. Siwa's body may be used to display regalia and thus be completely obscured by it, as seen in a great number of East Javanese images, to emphasize his majesty (and the majesty of the patron king), or it can be displayed, barely covered by cloth and with sparse ornaments, with a fairly accurate, yet not naturalistic, reproduction of natural forms, not devoid of sensuality and eroticism, as seen in many images from Central Java, especially bronzes, but not exclusively in images from that area. At the ninth-century Prambanan temple complex the male body (Siwa's body?)54 is displayed and exposed while dancing half naked, in sinuous postures - a celebra- tion of masculinity. Natural forms are not meticulously described in an attempt to show what nature looks like, but Siwa's body is infulsed with pulsating energy, inner move- ment, and inner breath. Siwa's genitals are never fully displayed; on the contrary, care seems to have been taken to cover the genital area except in the case of specific representations of Siwa as Bhairawa, of which we know only very few examples, such as the Singhasari Bhairawa now in the Leiden Museum of Ethnology. This care in covering the sexual organ seems to be at odds with the image of Siwa as lingga, which represents Siwa's phallus. But the motivation for covering anthropomorphic Siwa's penis should not necessarily be seen as coming from a coy desire to cover up a "shameful" part of the body, as a Judeo- Christian attitude to nakedness would suggest. It is more likely though this will remain specula- tion - to be an attempt to shield the viewer from the erotic power of Siwa, avoiding a naturalized represen- tation of a penis but emphasizing, through concealing its anatomical double, that Siwa's phallus is the seat of the male principle and of Siwa's dangerous sexual- ity.55 The lingga is usually shown in conjunction with the yoni (an abstraction of female genitals), never by itself; when it is not, the yoni pedestal is usually missing because it has been lost or destroyed. The male and female principles are inseparable, and the union - as metaphysical as it is sexual - of Siwa Sakti is an important Saiwa belief. Stances full of strength, hand gestures with varied meanings, and controlled poses imbued with move- ment characterize Siwa's representations in the art of Java. This observation holds for both Central and East Java, although the way it is locally articulated differs. The number of positions used by the sculptors is quite small, suggesting that they had a relatively limited postural vocabulary to choose from, which was in all likelihood fixed by convention. Conversely, the hand gestures and also the arm positions indicate a rich symbolic vocabulary, which unfortunately is not easy to understand. We do not yet know with precision which parts or movements of the body were ritually and socially significant for the ancient Javanese; thus the whole body should be the point of departure for any investigation of posture and gesture." CONCLUSIONS When we look at images, what do we see? The percep- tion we have of them leads us to an interpretation that begins from the moment we encounter the images.57 When we first see an art object, an artifact, its present context is as relevant as the past one we may be trying to retrieve, for the artifact belongs to both past and CD C%4 -i .z 192</page><page sequence="14">present. The interpretation involves making choices. For example, we may choose to see an object and attach to it a present value of some sort (by which I do not necessarily mean a monetary one), or we may choose to see the people who made it, what led them to make it, and the process by which they made it. Thus we can work out the way the artifact relates to their thinking and worldview. We may choose to do all these things simultaneously, constantly shifting our plane of analysis back and forth from present to past to present. And how are we looking at the object? Do we make aesthetic judgments? We clearly do, although we may not be wont to admit them, and this aesthetic appraisal is reflected in our museums' cultures of display (museums being the places where the object may end up). As Emma Barker notes, being on display is the condition by which the category of art is con- structed in the modern Western world.58 In the case of anthropomorphic images we are confronted with rep- resentations of the human body which we will deem to be artistic, and these representations may prompt us to reflect on issues of gender and sexuality and how these are constructed by us and by the makers of the images.59 With such questions at the back of my mind, I have, in this article, argued for greater flexibility and fluidity in classificatory practice. This argument is in view of the present location in museums, private gal- leries, and private homes of the majority of the images that have been the focus of my research. Their current location is not their original one, whatever that may have been, and in their present location a context is re-created, taking into account cross-cultural dia- logues, conceptual regroupings, and fresh classifica- tions and analogies whose purpose is not to constrain perceptions of the objects. I have also suggested some possible reinterpreta- tions, as in the case of images of Siwa the Teacher. There are more interpretive options to be explored. The objects have a new life in the present to which we need to adjust our thinking, and carry their past with them as a legacy, variously perceived and constructed. What I truly need to point out before closing is that as the images are interpreted and reinterpreted, gener- ating multivocality in the present, it must be remem- bered that the symbolic meaning of each image also varied in the past in relation to the specific beliefs and the level of awareness of the maker, viewer, or wor- shiper. This polyvalence of Siwa images is part of their being representations of Siwa. The concept of Siwa belongs to a complex religio-philosophical tradition, distinguished by esotericism. A worshiper of Siwa, ini- tiated into the practice by a guru, would understand the attributes of the god differently from a noninitiate. To a Siwa worshiper who has entered the higher world of Saiwa observances, the only reality is that of the powers that are the deity or deities. These powers are visualized by the worshiper as corresponding material representations are worshiped. The forms are only an instrument for establishing awareness and control of those powers. The attributes of the deities are outward symbols of inner realities. The Saiwa worshiper through yogic meditative and breathing techniques visualizes the inner realities and locates them in his or her body to achieve union with the Supreme Soul who dwells in his or her heart.60 One should therefore be aware of this framework of references, ideas, and expectations that surrounds the images and may work simultaneously and at different levels, in the past and in the present. *+ ALESSANDRA LOPEZ Y ROYO, Ph.D. (1990) in art and archaeology, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

The snake-shaped upawita is a reference to the association of Siwa with snakes. This association is always taken for granted but rarely explained. Javanese sources by and large do not have specific references to the significance of Siwa's snakes, although Javanese images of Siwa do show him wear- ing a snake as ornament. Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty has connected the snakes with eroticism in her discussion of the mythology of (Indian) Siva as the erotic ascetic, under- pinned by her research into Sanskrit texts: "The general sexual significance of snakes is of course well known; the excited cobra with expanded hood is often found encircling the linga, the tail carried down into the yoni."

These would have been known from prac- tice, handed down from master to appren- tice. There are no specific iconographic texts from ancient Java that present a codification of some sort, as there are in India. 35. See, for example, the work Wratisdsana (The Precepts of Ascetic) (Sharada Rani, 1961). 36. The exact nature of yogic discipline(s) and the way in which it was practiced are very difficult to know. Yoga was learned through a guru and was not available to everyone. By and large yogic practices involve meditation and physical discipline of some kind, but the details of each yogic school (sadanga, pratyahara, dhyaina, pranayama, tarka, and others) will never be accessible, as this is the kind of knowledge that would not be divulged and of which no record, apart from the name, can be found.

From extant temples in Central Java it is possible to say that it was quite usual for a lingga (another representation of Siwa) to be a principal temple image, with an image of Wisnu in the northern niche, Agastya in the eastern one, and Brahma in the south- ern one. An alternative pattern seems to have been temples with images of Durga Mahisasuramardini in the northern niche, of Ganesa in the eastern niche, of Agastya in the southern niche, and of the guardians Nandiswara and Mahakala in niches on either side of the eastern entrance. Candi Siwa at the Prambanan complex is a case in point. 38. Le. Poerbatjaraka, Agastya in den Archipel (Agastya in the Archipelago) (Leiden: Brill, 1926). 39.

Thus there may be some overlap. 46. This almost obsessive concern with dat- ing has not just to do with a "thirst for knowledge." A thriving art market is based on valorization of antiquity. The older the object, the more valuable it will be. Hence accurate dating is perceived to be para- mount. 47.

The interpretation of Trisiras in Java is open to controversy, as the interpretation of Trimirti and Mahesamuirti have been in India, judging from the relevant litera- ture, summarized in Maulana, Siva Dalam Berbagai Wujud, 186-89.

The danger of Indian Siva's sexuality has been highlighted by O'Flaherty, Asceticism and Eroticism in the Mythology of Siva. The association with danger of Siwa's excessive chastity and excessive sexuality is seen in the kakawin Smaradahana (The burn- ing of Kama) (Poerbatjaraka, R.
