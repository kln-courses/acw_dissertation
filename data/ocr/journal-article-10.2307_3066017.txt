These are further divided into types, which are sometimes intermediate ('I-II') or uncertain ('I or II'), and in three cases into variants also ('I A-C'). Painted pan-tiles and cover- tiles that have already been published for their decoration by Charlotte Wikander (A I, 1) are here re-published for their function by her husband. The types and terminology used in his catalogue entries are displayed in the schematic drawings on pp. 16-18, which merit more than local attention. In the catalogue itself, pan-tiles and cover-tiles are represented by all specimens that are whole or nearly so, and by fragments displaying special features ('completeness has been neither desirable nor feasible': p. 14); every fragment of antefix and sima is listed, and so are most of the ridge-tiles. The concordance (inv. no. - cat. no.: pp. 276-85) contains 2006 entries. All this tedious work, illustrated by the author's own drawings, leads to no general conclusions: the material from each zone is accompanied by analysis of the individual architectural contexts, but 'final discussion of the appearance of different buildings must await publication of the zones' (p. 23). And so, once more, must we. University of Edinburgh DAVID RIDGWAY REMO GELSOMINO: Ferentinum nel sistema viario romano (primo secolo a.C.-quarto secolo d.C.). (Universita degli studi di Siena, dipartimento di teoria (sez. scienze dell'antichita), Collana di studi e testi, 2.) Pp. 96; 4 figures. Rome: Herder, 1986. Paper. 'The Antonine Itinerary and Peutinger Table are not dry directories of distances, but when seen and read in a particular way, demonstrate the rhythm and distinctiveness of life in cities and districts' (p. 10). The point of this small study is to remind us that Ferentinum, 48 Roman miles from Rome, grew rich on the lines of communication which brought traffic from Campania to Rome by the Via Latina and which sent the livestock of the Appennines on their way to the consumers of the metropolis. Impressive Republican architecture reflects the benefits drawn from their opportunities by the Ferentinates. This apart, the evidence for their far from insignificant community is of the scantiest, and that of Strabo and the itineraries is fully examined here. The account could be much more concise and the analysis more critical, the author could have read more widely in the background material; but no-one will disagree with his enthusiastic conclusion that Ferentinum is an Italian city which deserves much more of the serious archaeological attention which alone will really enable us to measure the rhythm and assess the distinctiveness of its life. St John's College, Oxford NICHOLAS PURCELL SUSAN WOOD: Roman Portrait Sculpture 217-260 A.D.. the Transformation of an Artistic Tradition. (Columbia Studies in the Classical Tradition, 12.) Pp. xiv + 150; 64 plates. Leiden: Brill, 1986. U.S.$33.50, fl. 82. During the third century A.D. the Roman empire witnessed much that was disastrous, but a positive achievement is the one discussed by this monograph (originally a Columbia University doctoral dissertation): the continuation and development of the splendid tradition of Roman imperial and private portraiture. The period selected, A.D. 217-60, as the Preface points out, has long been recognised as 'a seminal phase in the origins of late-antique and medieval art' through a newly emotional depiction of anxiety and especially through 'a shift from naturalistic to abstract and symbolic treatment' (p. ix). Roman portraiture, particularly of the third and later centuries, presents a major problem: that of the identification of individuals represented. How is this handled? W. intends not to add to published iconographical studies, but to use those imperial portraits identified with reasonable certainty (listed in an Appendix) as a basis upon which to gather other unidentified portraits together and to attempt something hitherto rather neglected: a study of the art history of the period through these pieces: 'the steps by which the artistic traditions and conventions of portrait sculpture were changed by artists to meet new needs of society and patrons, imperial and private' (p. x).

Its first part ('Problems, methods and goals') begins with a definition of a portrait (as a recognisable image) and warns against emotional responses. Methods will include stylistic and also structural analysis (as though the piece were an abstract solid). Discussion then embraces types, functions (including funerary), commissions (some perhaps spontaneously by local communities), the different values of imperial portraits (usually provided by copyists) and private (executed by an artist from the sitter) to the art historian, and the intention to concentrate on those portraits created in the area of Rome, the artistic capital, so as to try to define trends and individual artistic personalities, as is done regularly for Greek or Renaissance art, but rarely for Roman (a reflection of the low esteem in which the Romans themselves held artists). The second part comprises an admirably clear review of scholarly literature on third-century art (to which students could usefully be directed) (pp. 11-25): it incorporates an assessment of the role of Plotinus and neoplatonist thought, and considers that inward ('inner-directed') factors (i.e. an inner momentum) should be regarded as more important than outward (' other-directed'), such as political propaganda, as an explanation of the period's rapid stylistic changes. The first chapter discusses 'one connecting thread' throughout: the influence of Caracalla's images, and of the 'Caracalla master' identified by S. Nodelman, with X-shaped slashes across the face, producing emotionality. Caracalla, although unlikable in many respects, did keep his popularity with the army, and so his image provided a useful reference for his successors. So an unbroken chain of descent can be traced down to the first portrait type of Gallienus (p. 48). A second chapter treats the classicism of the late Severans for two decades after Caracalla, a third the soldier-emperors, who used and transformed the Caracalla image in 'veristic' and 'impressionistic' ways, a fourth the extremely significant rise from the A.D. 240s and 250s onwards of a more abstract style, and a fifth the Gallienic ' renaissance', a time of complex visual references (many to the past, such as to Augustus and Hadrian), and also of further stylistic development and an increasing abstraction which looked forward to Tetrarchic and Constantinian art. A chapter of 'Conclusions' finds that the period produced 'many intelligent and imaginative artists' who responded to the needs of their rapidly changing society (p. 121). Within the limits which W. realises are set by the basic difficulty of studying this period of portraiture -- identification - an excellent job has been done. W. fully understands the complexities of ancient art production and this period, and has produced a lucid and readable study which should inspire further work from its largely original art-historical standpoint.

(Corpus Signorum Imperii Romani, Great Britain: Vol. 1, Fascicule 5.) Pp. xviii+69; 2 text figures, 37 monochrome plates. Oxford University Press, 1986. ?35. That magnificent international enterprise, the Corpus of Sculpture of the Roman World (CSIR), here receives a worthy addition with a well-illustrated volume which collects 109 sculptured items, many previously unpublished, from Roman military and civilian sites within what is now Wales, where the National Museum backed the project. An Introduction notes that 'sculpture is quite sparsely represented' in Wales (compared with other regions of Roman Britain), and discusses distribution, material (British stones, apart from marble for one Trajanic building inscription), stylistic considerations (generally low quality, and either 'provincial', 'immigrant' or 'Celtic' in character), and dating. Catalogue arrangement is by categories, namely: (1) deities and personifications, a Graeco-Roman (including Fortuna, Bonus Eventus, Genius, Medusa, Mercury, Salus and Mars), b Romano-Celtic (Mars Lenus, a mother goddess and a warrior god), (2) funerary monuments (including reliefs of Attis and Venus), (3) building records, (4) altars, (5) bronze statuary (notably fragments of armoured statues), (6) unidentified anthropomorphic figures, (7) animals, (8) architectural carvings (including a large number from Caerwent, Venta Silurum), (9) miscellaneous sculpture, (10) incerta, falsa et aliena.
