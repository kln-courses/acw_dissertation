<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRIMARY PROBLEM FOR AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY. II A. CLINTON WATSON Rockford College, Rockford, Illinois Modern philosophy had its roots in a quickened sense of the distinction between the human self and the nonhuman world in the midst of which its existence is cast. This enhanced self- consciousness of man began to move around two foci of difficulty: on the one hand the freshly stimulated intellect was keenly aware of its privilege of striving to know its environing world at first hand; on the other the new evaluation of human worth, accompanied by diminution of vital interest in the traditional "other" world of ecclesiastical thought, inevitably threw the objective "natural" world into the position of a more or less enigmatical vis-a-vis. Hence developed at once a twofold dualism, that of the knower and the object-of-knowledge, and of the self and the nonhuman "other." To comprehend the difficulties of the former phase of this dualism has been the task of epistemology; to solve those of the latter, the philosophical problem of religion. The two are obviously closely interwoven. Any solution of either one will ultimately have to reckon with the other. The great need is for a philosophy that embraces both problems from a unitary point of view, and works always with an empirical rather than a speculative method. For an empirical theology, of course, the second of these two dualisms and its various difficulties and proposed solutions are of primary importance. But the moral self, which must face its environing nonhuman world and discover, for weal or woe, whether that world is "spiritual" or "material," is also a knowing self, and the value of its religious convictions must always depend ultimately on the validity of its cognitional processes.' To the primary aspect of this twofold problem the present paper is devoted; '"Cognitional" is here used in the broadest sense, as including any form of con- sciousness that seems to grasp reality. 376</page><page sequence="2">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 377 of the other, its indispensable complement, a discussion will be given later. The present article is the continuation of an effort' to state in brief and simple outlines the way in which what I have'called the mechanical-mystical dilemma has presented itself in the course of philosophical reflection. In the previous article it was pointed out that when serious reflection is thrown back upon nature, on the collapse of some long-standing supranature scheme of things, man always finds some aspects of this nonsupernatural environ- ment which elicit from him social responses, more vague, less anthropomorphic, to be sure, than the original animism (or "ani- matism") of primitive religion, but no less truly social in their essential character. Of such social responses to the nonhuman environment (in other than these social moods called the physical world) the hylozoism of the Ionians was typical, as also the "nature poetry" of Bruno and Boehme. This sort of attitude, instinctive- reflective, I have called mysticism (or classical mysticism to dis- tinguish it clearly from the other type, which is an attitude directed toward the clearly supernatural socii of the divine "other" world). This social sort of attitude toward nature, however, is continually checked and modified by the mechanical habits of thought and action which the events and things of life ordinarily elicit from us. The mystical attitude and the mechanical attitude are thus pitted against each other, neither one being able to force the other com- pletely from the field. Thus through philosophy runs the mystical- mechanical dilemma. It was pointed out, further, that the outstanding efforts to find some resolution of this dilemma have moved upon one or other of three levels. In the first period, that of Greek philosophy, the problem was typically upon an objective level; in the second, from Bruno' to Leibniz, subjective-objective, that is, the external physical world is mechanically interpreted, the inner world is felt to I See "The Primary Problem for an Empirical Theology," American Journal of Theology, XXII (April, I918), 233. 2 In its beginnings, it is true, this period attributes to the "macrocosm" a quasi- personal quality, under the idea of natura naturans, and in so far it remains on the first or objective level. But the subjective-objective dualism is soon clearly formu- lated by Descartes.</page><page sequence="3">378 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY be spiritual, that is, it is mystically interpreted, and hence the problem of the relation between the microcosm and the macrocosm, the res cogitans and the res extensa, the "monad" which is soul and the "monad" which is (or seems to be) matter. Though Rousseau and the Romantic movement gave a check to the victory which, in rationalism, mechanism seemed to be winning over mysticism, the advent of physiological psychology, in particular, plunged thought into the old dilemma again, and during the last three-quarters of a century the battle has been waged with increas- ing bitterness, on the question whether the soul or the mind can have, rightfully, any mystical evaluation at all, or whether the human spirit must be seen in the last analysis as only an exceedingly complex mechanism of strictly material forces or elements. Of the tendency to give the inner life this latter purely mechanistic inter- pretation, Haeckel's philosophy is typical., On the third level, however, the problem is given a distinctly new formulation by Kant. His "Copernican revolution" consists, in a word, in relegating the question of the ultimate nature of reality, as it is apart from human consciousness, to the limbo of the unknowable and in striving instead to understand how it is that the human mind, by virtue of its very constitution, gives to experi- ence the two incompatible aspects of necessity and freedom, and then to discover the underlying unity of this, the mind's twofold activity, which produces these apparent irreconcilables. The explanation of how the mind mechanizes experience is given in the Critique of the Pure Reason; of how it mysticizes experience, in the Critique of the Practical Reason; of how these two are funda- mentally unitary, in the Critique of the Judgment (especially the first part, concerning the aesthetic judgment). It will be helpful to make, for the present, a definite effort to keep this phase of the significance of Kant's innovation distinct from the epistemological questions with which it is so closely con- nected. So far as the religious problem is concerned the importance of Kant consists simply in this, first, that the mechanical-mystical I Haeckel, in reality, only pushes the problem back to the first level, in that he attributes to the material atom a rudimentary sort of feeling or inclination-only one more of the many modifications of hylozoism.</page><page sequence="4">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 379 dilemma becomes primarily a question of how the human mind by virtue of its own operations gives of the same facts both a mechanistic and a mystical interpretation; and that, secondly, the reconciliation of these irreconcilables is seen to be primarily a psychological and not a metaphysical problem. This is the new cue for the discussion of the old problem. In so far as it has been ignored by the nineteenth-century philosophy nothing new has been added to the earlier viewpoints. And for the most part it has been ignored on account of three different directions in which the philosophy of the century has moved. i. The epistemological difficulties of a human idealism at once pushed philosophers on to an absolute idealism. Within this "absolute" doctrine the same mechanistic-mystical dilemma asserted itself again, so that, as in the case of rationalism and Rousseau, there was the antagonism of the mathematical-logical ideal and the ethical-emotional ideal; in absolute idealism we find a rationalistic dialectic which tends toward a denial that the absolute is "personal" (e.g., Bradley), and an ethico-mystical tendency which asserts that the absolute is "personal" (e.g., Royce). But obviously any attempt at a reconciliation of these opposing viewpoints must, in the nature of the case, be meta- physical or merely dialectical; and such an undertaking is not in line with the psychological method which Kant undertook (which, it is true, gave place to a logical and metaphysical pro- cedure before his task had been carried very far). 2. The inevitable reaction against idealism carried the problem back at once to the first, the objective, level. Herbart's "reals," for instance, are an attempted amalgamation of the primitive static and the primitive dynamic conceptions-the "reals" are abso- lutely changeless in themselves, and yet each seeks to "preserve its identity against disturbances on the part of the other reals." The common, unconfessed assumption of all such systems, from Democritus to Haeckel, is that if one can but reduce the non- dynamic (the non-mystical or mechanical) and the dynamic (the mystical) phases of experience each to the lowest conceivable terms, they will somehow fuse in a single type of existence, a simple entity. The success of all such systems depends upon either an</page><page sequence="5">380 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY elusive fallacy of equivocation, as in the case of Leibnitz' use of the term "representation," or the uncritical acceptance of a hyphenated atom or monad in place of the rejected enigma of a hyphenated (mechanical-mystical) world. 3. The century has been characterized by heroic efforts to ignore both the religious and the epistemological problems by restricting philosophical attention to the questions of the relation of the self and its human environment. But it is interesting to observe how inevitably these movements are forced to come' ultimately face to face with the very extra-human reality from which they tried to withdraw reflection. In this third tendency there are three clearly distinguishable types. (a) Positivism. But note that Comte, in his later days, recognizes the need of religion to supply the social movement with an adequate dynamic, and therefore elaborates his "religion of humanity"; this is a long step toward grounding ethics in an extra-human background, for "humanity" spans the ages and takes on some sort of cosmic significance. Guyau goes farther and describes ethical conduct as a sort of co-operation with the cosmos or with nature. (b) Utilitarianism. But note that Spencer's evolutionism drags the utilitarian ethics irresistibly into the realm of the philosophy of the extra-human by raising the question as to the relation between the law of biological survival and the law of human conduct; through Huxley and Green this issue is pushed on into an idealistic metaphysics. (c) In Germany, Max Stirner and Bahnsen give the non-metaphysical ethics an utterly individualistic tendency, defending a regardlessly solipsistic morality. Deprived thus of even its social anchorage (which it had in those typical French and English movements), the reaction against the philosophical tradition, with its apparently unsolvable religious and epistemological perplexities, finds a frantic culmina- tion in the Nietzschian demand for a " revaluation of all values." We come back then to the question as to how far Kant's formu- lation of the mechanical-mystical dilemma has guided philosophy in the last century. In one way his example has had a very great effect, in the practical dualism of existence and value, of intellectual processes and appreciative insight, of scientific method and religious faith, which has played so large a part in recent thought. For</page><page sequence="6">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 381 example, the whole Ritschlian movement is based on the Kantian dualism of the "pure reason" and the "practical reason." But this neo-Kantian movement fails to do justice to Kant's concern for the underlying unity of the mind, which, as said above, found expression in his Critique of the Judgment. The philosopher who in recent times has made the greatest effort to orient this problem of the mechanistic-mystical aspects of life on the third level, that of Kantian constructive idealism, and to seek a solution for it from the larger Kantian viewpoint is Bergson. He starts, as Kant did, to make a psychological study of the contradictory testimony which our human consciousness gives as to the nature of reality; his psychology proves inadequate, as Kant's did, and is supplemented by metaphysics; he combines a constructive idealism with dualism and realism, as Kant also did. (And yet, professing a radical empiricism and a thoroughgoing evolutionism, he seems to some to have much in common with the "pragmatism" of William James.) It seems to the present writer that a brief examination of Bergson's philosophy may make a particularly appropriate background against which to suggest the direction in which a strictly psychological, non-metaphysical method of approaching this ancient dilemma must probably proceed. Let us note, in the first place, how forcibly Bergson states the issue regarding the mechanical and mystical aspects of experience, especially in that realm where the ancient debate has taken on its peculiarly modern intensity, that of the inner life. This is the theme of the first of his three major works, Essai sur les donne~es immidiates de la conscience.' Note in the first place his discussion of the two conceptions of causality, the mathematical and the dynamic." These two conceptions are continually striving to replace each other. Unfortunately the habit has grown up of taking the principle of causality in both senses at the same time. .... Sometimes we think particularly of the regular succession of physical phenomena and of the kind of inner effort by 1 Paris, 1889; English translation by Pogson, Time and Free Will. Macmillan, 191o (3d ed. 1913). * Op. cit., pp. 204 ff. and 211 ff.</page><page sequence="7">382 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY which one becomes another; sometimes we fix our mind on the absolute regu- larity of the phenomena, and from the idea of regularity we pass by impercep- tible steps to that of mathematical necessity ..... And we do not see any harm in letting these two conceptions blend into one another and in assigning greater importance to the one or the other according as we are more or less con- cerned with the interests of science., But with the progress of science this quasi-personal notion of causation is more and more excluded in favor of mathematical equivalence. The sundering of these two ideas is an accomplished fact in the natural sciences. The physicist may speak of forces and even picture their mode of action by analogy with an inner effort, but he will never introduce this hypothe- sis into a scientific explanation. Even those who, with Faraday, replace the extended atoms by dynamic points will treat the centres of force and the lines of force mathematically, without troubling about force itself considered as an activity or an effort. It then comes to be understood that the relation of external causality is purely mathematical and has no resemblance to the relation between psychical force and the act which springs from it.2 Science cannot deal with time and motion except on condition of first eliminating the essential and qualitative element of time, duration, and of motion, mobility.3 Nevertheless, we cannot entirely succeed in mathematicizing the natural world. On this pertinacity of the anthropopathic ele- ment in our conception of nature, the way in which some not entirely necessary factor seems to remain, our feeling for a residual spontaneity in the natural process, note the following: We certainly feel, it is true, that although things do not endure as we do ourselves, nevertheless there must be some reason why phenomena are seen to succeed one another instead of being set out all at once. And this is why the notion of causality, although it gets indefinitely near that of identity, will never seem to us to coincide with it, unless we conceive clearly the idea of a mathematical mechanism or unless some subtle metaphysic removes our very legitimate scruples on that point.4 With regard to the inner life there is the same mechailical- mystical dilemma as in the case of outer fact. "There are finally two different selves, one of which is, as it were, the external projection of the other, its spatial and, so to speak, social representa- ' Op. cit., p. 216 (last italics mine). 2 Op. cit., pp. 218-19. 3 Op. cit., p. 115. 40p. cit., p. 210.</page><page sequence="8">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 383 tion. We reach the former by deep introspection, which leads us to grasp our inner states as living things, constantly becoming, as states not amenable to measure, which permeate one another and of which the succession in duration has nothing in common with juxtaposition in homogeneous space. But the moments at which we thus grasp ourselves are rare, and that is just why we are rarely free. The greater part of the time we live outside ourselves, hardly perceiving anything of ourselves but our own ghost, a colorless shadow which pure duration projects into homogeneous space. Hence our life unfolds in space rather than in time; we live for the external world rather than for our- selves; we speak rather than think; we "are acted" rather than act ourselves. To act freely is to recover possession of oneself, and to get back into pure duration."' "But, in our view, there is a third course which might be taken, namely, to carry ourselves back in thought to those moments of our life when we made some serious decision, moments unique of their kind, which will never be repeated-any more than the past phases in the history of a nation will ever come back again. We should see that if these past states cannot be adequately expressed in words or artificially reconstructed by a juxtaposition of simpler states, it is because in their dynamic unity and wholly qualitative multiplicity they are phases of our real and concrete duration, a heterogeneous duration and a living one. We should see that, if our action was pronounced by us to be free, it is because the relation of this action to the state from which it issued could not be expressed by a law, this psychic state being unique of its kind and unable ever to occur again. We should see, finally, that the very idea of necessary determination here loses every shred of meaning, that there cannot be any question either of foreseeing the act before it is performed or of reasoning about the possibility of the contrary action once the deed is done, for to have all the conditions given is, in concrete duration, to place oneself at the very moment of the act and not to foresee it. But we should also understand the illusion which makes the one party think that they are compelled to deny freedom, and the others that they must define it. It is because the transition is made by imperceptible steps from concrete duration, whose elements permeate one another, to symbolical duration, whose moments are set side by side, and conse- quently from free activity to conscious automatism. It is because, although we are free whenever we are willing to get back into ourselves, it seldom happens that we are willing. It is because, finally, even in the cases where the action is freely performed, we cannot reason about it without setting out its condi- tions externally to one another, therefore in space and no longer in pure dura- tion. The problem of freedom has thus sprung from a misunderstanding; it has been to the moderns what the paradoxes of the Eleatics were to the ancients, and, like these paradoxes, it has its origin in the illusion through which we 'Op. cit., pp. 231-32.</page><page sequence="9">384 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY confuse succession and simultaneity, duration and extensity, quality and quantity."' "In whatever way, in a word, freedom is viewed, it cannot be denied except on condition of identifying time with space; it cannot be defined except on condition of demanding that space should adequately represent time; it cannot be argued about in one sense or the other except on condition of previously con- fusing succession and simultaneity. All determinism will thus be refuted by experience, but every attempt to define freedom will open the way to determinism."2 Certainly we are under a great obligation to Bergson for stating so clearly the dilemma of the mind that is both religious and scientific. The fact stands out-amazing, fascinating. In the great moments of life we know ourselves to be free, but we can give no account of the experience in definite description, without, ipso facto, showing the whole experience to be utterly determined, step by step, element by element, in unbroken and unbreakable suc- cession of cause and effect, condition and consequence. We know our own free act as free and spontaneous, but the moment we reflect upon it our freedom utterly vanishes. The Greeks began this baffling quest by finding the world, self-contradictingly, both spirit and matter, both spontaneous and machine-like, both fortui- tous congeries of soulless atoms and meaningful system of events and ends. For us moderns the struggle of the two motifs has been, by psychology, reduced to the more bitterly contested arena of inner experience. That this is the core, the crux, of the religious problem, there can be no doubt. The fact that Bergson has put his finger so definitely and clearly upon it and has offered an appar- ently promiseful solution is ample explanation of his great popu- larity with thoughtful religious people. Let me anticipate here, for the sake of clearness and emphasis, the point which I hope to make at the conclusion of this paper. Bergson's problem turns upon this transition made by imperceptible steps from intuition to intellect, from the mystical to the mechanistic type of cognitional consciousness. The question is, Are these steps really imperceptible ? In spite of the fact that in many places Bergson speaks of intuition (or instinct) and intellect as 'Op. cit., pp. 238-40 (italics mine). C op. cit., p. 230.</page><page sequence="10">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 385 fused and blended in every moment of consciousness (and so, one would think, amenable to close psychological scrutiny and possible disentanglement), he has conceived of them, in his meta- physics, as so profoundly different in their respective natures that any actual psychological account of the "transition," any analysis of the " steps, " from intuitional to intellectual operations is simply out of the question. If his psychology had been adequate to the task of analyzing these so-called "imperceptible steps," would not his metaphysical account of the gulf between instinct and intellect have been quite uncalled for? In other words, if the gulf which seems to yawn between them could be seen, by psychological analysis, to be filled with a series of conscious states differing not in kind but only in innumerable delicate degrees, no metaphysical explanation would be required, for the gulf would not exist. A more adequate psychology would render unnecessary a more "subtle metaphysic." This doubtless is the direction in which an empirical theology must look for light on its primary problem, the mechanical-mystical dilemma. What then is the explanation which Bergson gives of this peculiarity of human experience, that by a kind of mystical direct apprehension we grasp the reality of spontaneity and freedom but by every act of intellectual reflection thereon we inevitably cognize our acts and thoughts as utterly determined, of this "illusion through which we confuse succession and simultaneity, duration and extensity, quality and quantity," of the fact that "the transition is made by imperceptible steps from concrete duration, whose ele- ments permeate one another, to symbolical duration, whose elements are set out side by side"? The explanation is, briefly, as follows: The Original Impetus, the Elan vital, the primordial "con- sciousness," like a jet of steam, becomes "congealed" into a kind of inert negation of its self; falls back, as it were, upon itself and so offers a kind of resistance and obstruction to its own free movement. This "inverse movement" of "consciousness" is "matter." But the Elan vital pushes its way into matter, retarding its "inverse" tendency, in part held back by it and in part carrying it along on its own current. In this partial imprisoning of the Impetus by its</page><page sequence="11">386 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY inverse movement, in this organization of inert matter by "con- sciousness," consists what we mean by "life." Life takes three directions-torpor, instinct, intellect. These, it is important to note, are not successive stages or levels but parallel branches of evolution. The contrasted characters of instinct and intellect are explained on the ground that in its progress life as instinct has been turned inward upon itself, whereas life as intellect has been turned toward matter. Instinct has thus a power of getting directly at the secrets of vital processes, whereas intellect must play forever upon the surface of living things as upon the surface of inert solids. The following citations (from Mitchell's translation of Creative Evolution) will make clear the foregoing interpretation. Consciousness, or supraconsciousness, is the name for the rocket whose extinguished fragments fall back as matter; consciousness again is the name for that which subsists of the rocket itself passing through the fragments and lighting them up into organisms [p. 261]. Life appears in its entirety as an immense wave which starting from a centre spreads outwards and which on almost the whole of its circumference is stopped and converted into oscillation [p. 2661. That undivided movement of descent which is materiality itself [p. 271]. The double form of consciousness is then due to the double form of the real, and theory of knowledge must be dependent upon metaphysics [p. 178]. Vegetative torpor, instinct, and intelligence-these, then, are the elements that coincided in the vital impulsion common to plants and animals, and which, in the course of a development in which they were made manifest in most unforeseen forms, have been dissociated by the very fact of their growth. The cardinal error which, from Aristotle onwards, has vitiated most of the philosophies of nature is to see in vegetative, instinctive, and rational life, three successive degrees of the development of one and the same tendency, whereas they are three divergent directions of an activity which has split up as it grew. The difference between them is not a difference of intensity, nor, more generally, of degree, but of kind [p. 351]. One of the clearest results of biology has been to show that evolution has taken place along divergent lines. It is at the extremity of two of these lines- the two principal-that we find intelligence and instinct in forms almost pure [p. 1751]. Intuition and intellect represent two opposite directions of the work of con- sciousness: intuition goes in the very direction of life itself; intellect goes in the inverse direction and thus finds itself naturally in accordance with the move- ment of matter [p. 267].</page><page sequence="12">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 387 Instinct and intellect are two divergent developments of one and the same principle, which in the one case remains within itself, in the other steps out of itself and becomes absorbed in the utilization of inert matter. This gradual divergence testifies to a radical incompatibility and points to the fact that it is impossible for intelligence to reabsorb instinct. That which is instinctive in instinct cannot be expressed in terms of intelligence [p. 167]. Consciousness is essentially free; it is freedom itself; but it cannot pass through matter without settling on it, without adapting itself to it. This adaptation is what we call intellectuality [p. 270]. The intellect has been cut out of it [life] by a process resembling that which has generated matter [p. 268]. If consciousness has thus split up into intuition and intelligence it is because of the need it had to apply itself to matter at the same time as it had to follow the stream of life [p. 178]. The success of physics would be inexplicable, if the movement which con- stitutes materiality were not the same movement which, prolonged by us to its end, that is to say, to homogeneous space, results in making us count, measure, follow in their respective variations terms that are functions one of another. To effect this prolongation of the movement, our intellect has only to let itself go, for it runs naturally to space and mathematics, intellectuality and materiality being of the same nature and having been produced in the same way [p. 219]. For-we cannot too often repeat it-intelligence and instinct are turned in opposite directions, the former toward inert matter, the latter toward life. Intelligence, by means of science, which is its work, will deliver up to us more and more the secret of physical operations; of life it brings us, and, moreover, only claims to bring us, a translation in terms of inertia. It goes all around life, taking from outside the greatest possible number of views of it, drawing it into itself instead of entering into it. But it is to the very inwardness of life that intuition leads us [p. 176]. The intellectual representation of continuity is negative, being at bottom only the refusal of our mind before any actually given system of decomposition to regard it as the only possible one. Of the discontinuous alone does the intel- lect form a clear idea [p. i541. Of immobility alone does the intellect form a clear idea [p. 1551. The intellect is characterized by a natural inability to comprehend life [p. i651. The main purpose of the present discussion is to point out, first, that Bergson's philosophy has the inveterate mechanical-mystical dilemma as its central problem; then, that his discussion which begins with psychological analysis (the third level, upon which the problem has gained a footing since Kant's great innovation)</page><page sequence="13">388 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY is soon forced to re-enter the metaphysical realm because of the inadequacy of this psychological analysis; and, finally, to sug- gest, against this background, the direction in which a more tenacious and consistent psychological investigation must probably proceed in order to overcome this deficiency, and thus enable empirical theology to come to terms with science upon ground that is itself a proper subject for strictly scientific treatment. A criti- cism of the Bergsonian metaphysics, therefore, is beside the mark. It is, however, pertinent to the main issue to note at least one point (a pivotal point it is) in which the metaphysics most obvi- ously points to an unsolved psychological problem, and to indicate how unsatisfactory the proffered metaphysical solution is. And the point in question is not merely a pivotal point so far as Berg- son's treatment of this religious problem is concerned; it is like- wise essential to his treatment of the other, the epistemological, phase of that great underlying self-and-nature dualism which, as I indicated at the outset, is the most important motif of modern philosophy. I refer to his doctrine of the relation between the spatiality of matter and the spatiality of the intellect. Note the following characteristic statements:! "Determinations of space or categories of the understanding, whichever we will, spatiality and intellectuality being moulded on each other" (p. 257). " In- tellectuality and materiality have been constituted in detail by reciprocal adaptation" (p. 186). "The division of unorganized matter into separate bodies is relative to our senses and to our intellect, and matter, looked at as an indivisible whole must be a flux rather than a thing" (p. 186). "It is our perception which cuts inert matter into distinct bodies" (p. 227). But compare with these last two statements the following: "Things have a natural tendency to fit into a frame of this kind." "A certain natural geometry suggested by the most general and immediately perceived properties of solids" (p. i6i). In a word, space is partly real and partly ideal; matter has a "certain natural geometry," and "all the operations of our intellect tend to geometry." "When we observe that a thing really is there where it acts, we shall be led to say (as Faraday was) that all the atoms interpenetrate and SMitchell's translation of Creative Evolution.</page><page sequence="14">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 389 that each of them fills the world. On such a hypothesis, the atom, or more generally the material point, becomes simply a view of the mind, a view which we come to take when we continue far enough the work (wholly relative to our faculty of acting) by which we subdivide matter into bodies. Yet it is undeniable that matter lends itself to this subdivision, and that in supposing it breakable into parts external to one another, we are constructing a science sufficiently representative of the real" (p. 203). And what is the explanation of this reciprocal spatiality of matter and intellect ? The most concise statement is the following: "The space of our geometry and the spatiality of things are mutu- ally engendered by the reciprocal action and reaction of two terms which are essentially the same, but which move each in the direc- tion inverse of the other .... ,"' a statement which neither in itself nor in its thirty-odd pages of exposition is very illuminating or convincing. But-and this is the important thing-Bergson's treatment suggests here the very point at which the problem of knowledge needs most to be attacked. "This long analysis was necessary to show how the real can pass from tension to extension and from freedom to mechanical necessity by way of inversion."'2 But this analysis begins with a little psychological introspection.3 Query: Might not a more thoroughgoing psychology, genetic as well as introspective, with the aid of physics, give us a more empiri- cal and hence a more useful account of this undeniable reciprocity of spatiality, of quantity-ness, between thought and things, which is the strength of exact science and the stronghold of realism ? Let us now note some general aspects of Bergson's psychology. Probably its chief point of inadequacy is its lack of an appreciation of the instinctive nature and primary importance of social experi- ence. For Bergson the individual seems to be primary and social consciousness secondary. This inadequacy is of special importance in connection with the question of the self. What is the "funda- mental self," and what are the "parasitic selves" of which he 'Op. cit., p. 202. This recalls the similar fashion in which Aristotle resolved the dilemma as it shaped itself in his time, namely the skilful playing upon one another of two mutually necessary and strictly complementary conceptions. See the preced- ing article on this subject in the American Journal of Theology, XXII (April, 1918), 242. 2Op. cit., p. 236. 3 Op. cit., pp. 199-220.</page><page sequence="15">390 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY speaks so often ? Here one cannot but observe how little Bergson appreciates the part which social experience plays in the actualiza- tion of any real selfhood. For him the parasitic self is the "spa- tialized," that is, social, self. The fundamental self is essentially nonsocial. As the self thus refracted and thereby broken to pieces is much better adapted to the requirements of social life in general and language in par- ticular, consciousness prefers it and gradually loses sight of the fundamental self. Below the self with well-defined states, a self in which succeeding each other means melting into one another, and forming an organic whole. .... But we are generally content with the first, i.e., with the shadow of the self projected into homogeneous space.' . ... In order to recover this fundamental self, as the unsophisticated consciousness would perceive it, a vigorous effort of analysis is necessary, which will isolate the fluid inner states from their image, first refracted, then solidified, in homogeneous space.2 But to discover the "fundamental self" by withdrawing from all human intercourse, surely that is impossible. Yet Bergson is certainly right in insisting that if we are to get to the bottom of life's problem we must discover the fundamental self and assign it a rightful sway over the parasitic selves. That indeed is a most important point for the philosophy of religion. But an empirical procedure would surely require every man to answer the question, what is for him his fundamental self ? If the psychologist can discover any unanimity in the results of such an inquiry, well and good-such a definition may be taken as authoritative. But the futility of looking for a self that is just itself, a pure, isolated, uncon- ditioned self, surely is apparent. The great question is, In what situation is the self most active, most free, most alive ? What is the most vital relationship in which we find it ? When is a man most truly himself? Even our freedom, whenever and however deeply experienced, is never an utterly relationless freedom. We are free for something, from something, to do something, to be something. Just sheer unadulterated freedom is the barest ab- straction. And furthermore, it may well be that the less impor- tant phases of life are not so much parasitic selves as conditioning and contributing selves.

The psychology of Bergson, then, has this crucial defect of isolating the self. But this is a twofold isolation. In the first place the self is regarded as fundamentally individual, atomistic. The social self is a "parasitic self." The "real self" is a self which can never be known in social, that is spatialized, experience. In the second place the "real self" is still further isolated within the larger and more "spatial" phases of even personal experience. To find this real self one must turn in upon the deepest of "deep- seated psychic states." Now this is a most interesting counter- part of the Cartesian self. The self which has figured strategically in the post-Cartesian epistemological discussions is the knowing self. Cogito, ergo sum. The real self is the self of cognitive function. This cognizing self has been isolated within the vague general matrix of experience, and from this isolation have grown the whole brood of epistemological perplexities. But for Bergson the isolated self is the exact opposite of the Cartesian cognizing self. It is the self which does not cognize but feels, intuits. But the isolation is no less extreme and no less troublesome. For the Cartesian the fatal difficulty is to pass from the acts of the isolated cognizing self to the common-sense, everyday acts and experiences of the human organism. For Bergson the difficulty is to pass from the acts of the isolated pure durational self to commonplace knowledge and social, spatial experience. In this Bergson is, though appar- ently so far removed from the traditional epistemologists, really at one with them. Likewise he is at one with them in isolating the self from the social organism of which it is an integral part. The two sorts of isolation, however, are practically the same. It is a severing of the vital ties between the so-called real self and its supposedly less real experience. The importance of this point cannot be overestimated. With such a psychology no one can possibly escape the necessity of seeking in metaphysics a cure of the troubles which follow in its train. It surely is obvious that since such an isolation of the self is, artificial any other solution than an undoing of this isolation is bound to be artificial. If this isola- tion be frankly denied, the passing by "imperceptible" steps from</page><page sequence="17">392 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY the experience of the so-called real self to that of the so-called parasitic self is not a mystery to be solved by a "subtle meta- physics," but a process capable of psychological analysis. There is another most important point in which Bergson has failed to scrutinize closely enough the actually observable work- ings of the human mind. The business of the intellect, he insists, is to facilitate our actions upon solids. In this, and in so far, he is an "instrumentalist." But he stops far short of the broad truth recognized today by many American psychologists and logicians, namely, that intellectual processes are "instrumental" not only for action upon solids but for all desired ends, whether they be ethical, religious, political, or physical. Not only so, but these "instru- mental" forms of consciousness are not merely spatial in their essential character; rather they are "abstract "-this is their very usefulness, in that irrelevant characteristics of things and events are pro tempore ignored, and only the one or the few char- acteristics of those things or events which are of supreme impor- tance in the situation are emphasized or even noticed. No doubt the spatializing, unitizing type of "abstraction" is of tremendous importance; but the "intellectual" processes are not necessarily only spatial. "Spaciality" is no doubt a conspicuous character of "intellectuality," but by no means all of it. And "fabrication," action upon solids, is no doubt a conspicuous example of instru- mental consciousness, but it by no means monopolizes it. But not only is Bergson's metaphysics made necessary by the inadequacy of his psychology; not only is this metaphysics quite unconvincing, especially in such a central matter as the theory of "inversion"; but the basic distinction between instinct and intellect leads logically to the most undesirable practical conse- quences. The isolation of the intuitional self from the intellectual self, in spite of the "subtle metaphysics" which seeks to reveal their underlying unity, continues the divorce of religion and science; and the isolation of the real self from the social self continues the divorce between religion and social endeavor. Social life, civilization, the technique of progress, are obviously dependent upon the intellect. All mystical experience, all sense of freedom and spontaneity, all direct sense of the original life, these, for Bergsonism, are functions</page><page sequence="18">PROBLEM OF AN EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY 393 of intuition. To save our souls we must renounce the world. There is no idea of a corporate salvation. The fusion of scientific social service and religious enthusiasm is logically impossible. But this means ethical apriorism, religious fanaticism, and socially barren intellectualism. To separate the real self and the social self, the self of intuition and the self of collective endeavor, is to divorce the vision of God and the task of civilization, to paralyze the Christian conscience, to quench the dream of the twentieth- century religion of a "new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness." To summarize the foregoing discussion of Bergson: His phi- losophy is primarily an effort to resolve the mechanical-mystical dilemma upon the plane of constructive idealism (the third level on which this ancient perplexity has moved). This task evidently calls for a psychological examination of the antagonistic mechaniz- ing and mysticizing activities of consciousness, and an attempt to find some underlying unity of the two tendencies. Bergson, however, has recourse to a so-called intuitional metaphysics to sup- plement his psychology ("theory of knowledge and theory of life" seeming to him to be "inseparable"). The real reason, however, why metaphysics is so soon fallen back upon probably is that his psychology is fundamentally inadequate. As it is, the core of his metaphysical explanation, the theory of "inversion," is not by any means convincing, and the dualism of intuition and intellect is not sufficiently mitigated by Bergson's theory of evolution to remove the unfortunate practical dualism of religion and science, religion and social endeavor. What then are the chief points of inadequacy in the psychology with which Bergson approaches the mechanical- mystical problem ? There are four such points: (a) the individual self is too much isolated from its real social matrix; (b) the "instru- mental" character of intellectual processes is too closely restricted, being affirmed only of the consciousness accompanying our action on solids; (c) the instinctive-intuitional and the intellectual phases of consciousness are too rigidly distinguished, even though their fusion in common experience is admitted; (d) no effort is made toward a genuinely genetic psychological study of the "undeniable" mystery of a mutual spatiality in thought and things, but instead</page><page sequence="19">394 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY we are given a purely speculative account of the common genesis of intellect and matter. Of the first two of these four defects we have in contemporary American thought abundant correction: of the first in our social psychology' and of the second in the literature of "experimental logic."' Some of the discussions in the latter have a bearing also upon the third point.3 But so far as I am aware the last two difficulties have not been discussed in any way that throws light upon the problem of religion. It is the question involved in the third of the four points4 urged here against Bergson's psychology that is most crucial for the primary phase of the problem of religion, which is, as this and the preceding article have maintained, the mechanical-mystical dilemma. I have already stated the issue.5 It amounts simply to this: ignoring for the time being the question as to which of the two types of cognitional consciousness gives us the nearer approach to reality, we are primarily concerned to under- stand how or why we do move from one type to the other, how they are related to each other, what, in a word, the "imperceptible steps" actually are by means of which we pass from the moment of "practical reason" to that of "pure reason," from that of "duration" to that of "spatiality," from the mystical to the mechanical, from religion to science. For surely these are not two incommensurable activities of a divided ego, but are part and parcel of each other, inextricably interwoven, fused by innumerable connective activities, with which they are continuous, into an integral organic consciousness.
