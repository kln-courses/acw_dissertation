<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sociological Quarterly 18 (Winter 1977): 108-125 Managerial Strategies and the Worker: a Marxist Analysis of Bureaucracy* PAUL GOLDMAN DONALD R. VAN HOUTEN The American University University of Oregon Systematic study of the sociology of organizations is almost absent in both the classical and modern Marxist traditions. Although some recent studies in the Marxist tradition show considerable promise, the field has been dominated by the Weberian perspective. The development of new theory should be informed by the Marxian concepts of (a) labor theory of value, (b) the forces and relations of production, (c) historical development of capitalism, and (d) class structure and class struggle. Bourgeois organizational theory has some serious deficiencies, but there is much of value that can be subsumed under the broader rubric of Marxist political economy. The potential for a Marxist theory of bureaucracy is explored in an examination of managerial strategies to minimize external uncertainties in a monopoly capitalist system, and internal uncertainties arising from the work force. Strategies for controlling the work force in- clude the division of labor, organizational hierarchy, rules and procedures, the uses of secrecy and hoarding of knowledge, and the maintenance of ethnic and sexual divisions in the work force. Further research is needed on (a) differentiating capital accumulation and social control strategies, (b) comparisons between workers in the state and corporate sectors, (c) comparisons between work organization under full range of socialist economies and those in capitalist economies in both manufacturing and government and (d) alternatives for the future. SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE SOCIOLOGY of organizations is almost absent in both the classical and modern Marxist traditions. Marxist scholars have given little attention to the bureaucratic aspects of the labor process and have thus left us without a sophisticated understanding of how managerial decision making and the institution of "bureaucratic rationality" have served the purposes of capital accumulation and social control of the work force during the capitalist epoch. This inattention has limited our knowledge of the structural contradictions of capitalist administrative practice. For the most part Marxists have ceded this area of intellectual inquiry to professors of business administration and to sociologists who take the Weberian perspective as a point of departure. Both Giddens (1973) and Wright (1974) have described the disjunction between the Marxian and Weberian traditions in a fashion that is suggestive for the study of the industrial enterprise. Wright notes: Marxists have generally continued to focus on the dynamics and contradictions of capitalist society seen as a total system, while paying relatively little attention to the organizational dynamics of the state ... Analysts in the Weberian tradition in contrast, have continued to treat organizations in isolation from the social contradictions in which they are embedded (1974:103). We hope in this paper to begin to synthesize these divergent viewpoints, and subsume current bourgeois' administrative and sociological theory and research under the broader rubric of Marxist political economy.

Marglin's (1974) analysis of hierarchy during the industrial revolution and Stone's (1973) discussion of the development of job ladders in the late nineteenth century steel industry show how changes in the division of labor stem as much from the desire to effect organizational control as from the need to apply continually advancing technology to production. Braverman (1974) and Edwards (1975), analyzing contemporary work organization, suggest that machinery and bureaucratic regulations in industry derive from managerial desires to effect substantial control over both labor market characteristics and the attitudes of workers. This research indicates that managerial thinking is attuned to the larger social, political, and economic setting, as well as to internal administration. Other Marxist or quasi-Marxist research informs the study of bureaucracy, albeit in a more indirect fashion. Studies of economic elites, focusing particularly on interinstitutional relationships and the interpenetration of economics and politics, provide an alternative view of managerial behavior to that found in most literature on organizations (Melman, 1970; Lens, 1970; Domhoff, 1967, 1969, 1972). Marxist theories of the state and of the differences between "productive" and "non-productive" labor raise new issues connecting political economy to bureau- cratic administration (Gold, et al., 1975; O'Connor, 1973, 1976). Finally, research on current and past worker struggles (Aronowitz, 1973); Davis, 1975; Brecher, 1972; Palmer, 1975) and on the burgeoning workers' control movement (Hunnius, 1973; Jenkins, 1973) help emphasize both how workers make history and how bureaucratic arrangements are influenced by the political activities of organized and unorganized workers and not merely by executive decision. Tentative Requirements for a Theory Any effort to develop new sociological theory, or to apply existing theory to new areas of social life, faces two complementary tasks: (1) integrating new concepts within a larger theoretical framework, in this case Marxist political economy, and (2) addressing issues that have been inadequately explained by alternate or competing theories. Past organizational theory has been unsuccessful in these endeavors since, with few exceptions, there has been little serious effort to fit bureaucratic organization into broader theories of society.2 At the same time, even within the field, there is little consensus on critical issues, with each researcher concentrating on relatively narrow aspects of organizational life. What Marxian concepts should inform the study of bureaucracy in order to provide it with the necessary theoretical foundation? Four in particular stand out: (1) the labor theory of value, (2) a focus on the forces and relations of production, (3) historical analysis regarding capitalism as a continually developing system at once resolving old contradictions and generating new ones, and (4) an emphasis on class structure and class struggle. These represent less a source of derivable propositions to be tested than a set of guidelines to be followed in analyzing bureaucratic behavior.3 2The exceptions are, however, quite important within the history of sociology. Weber (1947) linked his analysis of bureaucracy to the historical process of rationalization within Western civilization. More recently, Parsons (1956) and Merton (1957) have attempted to use functionalism as a framework for examining bureaucracy. 3Blauner's (1964) and Zwerman's (1970) attempts to test derived hypotheses falter bacause they have not related their research to the larger context of the theory.</page><page sequence="3">110 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY The labor theory of value, of course, attempts to explain the generation of a commodity's value by the human labor involved in its production. The worker must, of course, sell his or her labor power to the capitalist in order to survive. A corollary is the capitalist's continuing effort to obtain and reinvest surplus value as a necessary mechanism within capitalist economies. There is little indication that this mechanism is less operative in contemporary monopoly capitalism than in the developing capitalism observed by Marx although new obstacles to successful accumulation and reinvestment have emerged (Baran and Sweezy, 1966; Gal- braith, 1967; Leonard, 1969; Moore, 1962).4 What we seek to do is emphasize how the drive to generate surplus value can be found in the structure and decision- making of bureaucracies. This rather obvious point cannot be emphasized too strongly. Capitalists and managers have a persistent interest in keeping labor costs down and have developed strategies-direct and indirect, short-term and long-run -devoted to this purpose. The nature of these strategies is discussed later in this paper. For Marx the conscious production of the material necessities of life is the essence of the human condition (Marx, 1964). Within each historical epoch the existing forces of production5 are forged into a set of typical social relations that allocates both the work to be done by and the rewards given to each member of society. The dominant class in each period determines (and maintains) the forms of ownership and control over the means of production (factories, machinery, etc.), the division of labor, the relationships between those working for a concern, and the socio-technical relations and procedures (Heydebrand, 1975). It is an emphasis on the generation of surplus value, however, rather than on the forces of production alone that determines capitalist social relations. The sense that new forces of production (technology for example) are developed to strengthen existing social relations of production is one presumption setting apart Marxist from bourgeois analyses of bureaucracy. The historical approach within Marxism enables us to locate past sources of current managerial practices and stress fundamental continuities within the capitalist experience. Capitalists--entrepreneurs and managers alike-need to organize production in the face of a potentially recalcitrant labor force that may actively or passively resist control from above. Recent historical studies show how central this has been to managerial thinking and suggest that technology, the division of labor, bureaucratic rules, and management training and internal social mobility have been responsive to needs for labor discipline (Pollard, 1965). These trends began as early as 1770 in Wedgewood's pottery factories, and continued in Taylorist rituals at the turn of century, in post-war incentive plans, and "humanis- tic" management. Capitalists no longer rely on physical coercion due to the trade union movement, labor law, and variations in the labor market. In unorganized, largely non-monopoly sectors of the economy, however, the labor process bears a strong similarity to the earlier period (Edwards, 1975; Mallet, 1975).6 The 4The emphasis on growth in many of these works stresses the reinvestment aspect of the equation and tends to assume the need for accumulation. Starbuck's (1956) litany of executive motives also places an emphasis on growth and its correlates. 5The forces of production include the human abilities to perform physical and mental labor, rationality and science, and the physical implements used in production such as tools, instruments, machines, and technical innovations. 6Physical force, and the fears it engenders, is still a factor in "labor discipline" among farmworkers, especially migrants, and Appalachian coal miners.</page><page sequence="4">Managerial Strategies and the Worker 111 continued trend towards automated machinery suggests further routinization in monopoly sectors (Braverman, 1974). The fourth element in Marxist thought, class struggle, is firmly embedded in bureaucracies. Some non-Marxist conflict theories, notably Dahrendorf (1959), have dealt with this issue, although their model admits only to a permanent state of tension between management and labor, not to antagonistic and irreconcilable contradictions. It is necessary to go beyond the relationship between capitalist hegemony and worker struggle, using this structured contradiction to explain changes and developments within capitalism, and to discover whether they may lead to its ultimate transformation. This ambitious project faces numerous difficulties, most notably the apparent separation between industrial and electoral politics, at least in the United States. Nevertheless, widespread awareness of the corruption of business and political elites, the inability of the "system" to stem either inflation or unemployment, the growing disillusion and alienation on the part of the workers, and the domino effects of labor disputes might eventually bring industrial politics into the larger political arena. Internal structural contradictions too may increase class conflict. The speed-up to a record assembly line pace at General Motors' Lordstown plant provoked a reaction similar to the first widespread implementation of Taylorism. The Lordstown events are indicative of a new militancy and class consciouness among predominantly young workers (Aronowitz, 1973; Davis, 1975; Georgakis and Surkin, 1975; Rothschild, 1973). Reactions to Taylorism, it should be recalled, contributed significantly to the growth of International Workers of the World (I.W.W.). New machinery in offices and retail stores has continued the pro- letarianization and routinization of much white collar work, especially that performed by women (Braverman, 1974; Tepperman, 1976). Organizing drives among these workers and the knowledge and experience gained by the women's movement may result in a new phase of class conflict. The challenges posed by these issues have not been taken up by bourgeois sociologists studying organizations. The reasons for this are both ideological and situational. Conservatizing influences can be found in the close ties between sociology and business administration academics with the corporate and govern- ment worlds, in the privileged financial position of business schools within most universities, and in the academics' need for research access to business organiza- tions. These factors have contributed to five serious deficiencies in organizational analysis. Most have been commented upon by critics (Baritz, 1960; Benson, 1975; Hirsch, 1975; Mouzelis, 1967; Perrow, 1972; Wolin, 1960).7 First, the field has been ahistorical with little attention given the ways in which a particular organization (or type of organization) has evolved or changed.8 Even studies of change have a very brief time span. Second, the sociology of organizations has been isolated from issues of social class, social stratification, and social conflict. One consequence of this has been an anthropomorphic orientation where organizations "act" rather than individuals in social classes acting in defense of their class interests. Third, the field has emphasized microanalysis with either the work group or the single organization serving as the primary unit of analysis. Thus there is little discussion of 7A more complete overview of these characteristics of bourgeois organizational sociology can be found in Goldman (1976). 8One exception, widely admired but little emulated is Stinchcombe's (1965) analysis of organiza- tional development.</page><page sequence="5">112 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY how the economy, the political context, or the community affects day-to-day organizational life. Fourth, the field is elitist in the interests of capital and management rather than those of workers and in assuming that managerial behavior is more important, more variable, and more worthy of study than that of workers. Finally, the discipline, with the exception of the now unfashionable study of bu- reaucratic "dysfunctions," is undialectical, seldom seeing the roots of tomorrow in the reality of today. There is, however, much of value for Marxists in this literature. Extensive fieldwork and survey research, sometimes requiring reinterpretation, are the best available sources of organizational data. Moreover, the close tie between the profession and the business community is presumably based on mutual understand- ing and respect. Consequently, published work represents a potential guide to the intentions, concerns, and styles of corporate elites. Business school students and managers take courses from organizational analysts, and the latter's books and articles, for example those of Peter Drucker, often have a significant following among businesspeople and therefore should be studied and taken seriously. Big Business and Monopoly Capitalism Managerial strategy for controlling the work force must be set within the context of a monopoly capitalist system in which industry has become progressively concentrated and oligopolistic.9 Yet at the same time capitalists face an uncertain world as resources become scarcer, as nationalist movements remove areas of the world from imperial dependency, and as business cycles increase their frequency and intensity (Baran and Sweezy, 1966; Perlo, 1973). Even on a less global scale, potential changes in ownership and control, executive shake-ups, and mergers are everyday facts of life for capitalists and managers. Successful management, and managerial tenure, require minimizing uncertainties in areas other than labor including problems of obtaining capital and raw materials, political support in tax and labor legislation, zoning laws, government contracts, and sales of products whether to corporate clients or to the consuming public. For Thompson (1967) maximizing certainties in the "technical core" of a firm is the primary organizational task, but a routinized technology and labor force is worth little if left vulnerable to the uncertainties of inputs and outputs, that is of supply schedules, customers' demands, new machinery and so on. Managers can buffer these by stockpiling raw materials, leveling supply and demand curves by differential rate schedules that induce corporate clients to buy or sell at specific times or in bulk quantities, rationing their product if demand exceeds supply and, these failing, predicting surplus or shortage and attempting to compensate. Their success at these endeavors can determine the stability and, often, the wage rates of the labor force (Edwards, 1975). These strategies are most common for smaller corporations and those in highly competitive sectors. Conglomerates can more easily maintain contractual relation- ships with complementary firms or interlock with them through merger. This pays off in bulk rates and priority shipping. While the turn-of-the-century merger movement was designed to eliminate competition (and was only partially success- ful), the merger movement of the twenties saw the beginnings of vertical integration 9Between 1947 and 1968, the 200 largest manufacturing corporations increased their portion of total manufacturing assets from 47.1 percent to 60.4 percent (Blair, 1972).</page><page sequence="6">Managerial Strategies and the Worker 113 (Nelson, 1959). Mining concerns bought refineries; refiners purchased mines and oil fields, Sears Roebuck went first into direct retailing, then into manufacturing. In recent years conglomerates have purchased firms in new areas, domestic or foreign, where labor costs are lower. Managers and owners benefit significantly from monopoly or oligopoly power which allows them to undercut smaller rivals by subsidizing price wars, denying materials to producers who have no other supplies to turn to, and by colluding with nominal rivals to fix prices. Monopoly pricing raises the ceiling on prices and gives managers greater flexibility in dealing with workers' wage demands. Less formal cooperation between corporations serves a political and legitima- tion function. Coalitions, trade associations, and superorganizations serve the interests of seeming competitors by masking joint action and presenting a public service image. Some such organizations are illegal cartels (MacAvoy, 1965), but more commonly they are trade associations that lobby at municipal, state, and federal levels, or engage in collective research and development (as in retailing), or collectively negotiate with large trade unions. Superorganizations in utilities integrate corporations and the state around such issues as nuclear power. Similarly large-scale retailers and the real estate and construction industries cooperate in urban redevelopment schemes. These umbrella organizations acquire a "public" image insulating them from grass roots pressures and dividing citizens between their roles as producers, consumers, and members of the community. Merger and superorganization are probably, as Wycko (1975) and Boddy and Crotty (1974) suggest, responses to crises of low capital availability and natural reactions to certain stages of the business cycle. They may, however, generate new problems for individual corporations and contradictions for the system as a whole. According to Chandler (1962), General Motors, Sears, Dupont, and Standard Oil of New Jersey all encountered structural strains during expansion. Internal coordi- nation becomes more problematic, and sub-units and their managing executives become dangerously competitive with each determining its own priorities (Rosen- feld, 1972). The demise of the Penn Central is an instance of this process although there the holding company pauperized the railroad to benefit their other sub- sidiaries (Fitch and Oppenheimer, 1970). Although his study focuses on short-run results, Pfeffer (1972) suggests that merger is not generally profitable despite the advantages of economies of scale, oligopolistic pricing, lessened competition, and increased lobbying. Mergers can have negative consequences for the economy as a whole even if individual conglomerates may profit. The first two major periods of mergers were ended by severe economic crises: the "panic" of 1907 and the crash of 1929. The post-war merger movement was followed by the continued recession of the seventies. Windfall profits and the tendency of the surplus to rise with monopoly pricing may serve individual firms, but they generate needs for investment typically satisfied by military spending and imperialist adventures (Baran and Sweezy, 1966). CONTROLLING THE WORK FORCE: A SUMMARY OF MANAGERIAL STRATEGIES Management is no less concerned with insuring certainty in the "social relations of production" within the firm. To assure such certainty involves dealing with workers, many of whose interests are in contradiction with those of management, and doing so in the context of potential class conflict-an underlying reality of which both parties are aware.</page><page sequence="7">114 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY The managerial orientation is towards obtaining as much work, with as little trouble, as they possibly can from workers. These purposes-capital accumulation and social control-complement one another although their relative importance may vary with organized worker activity. The managers' power to define the social relations of production, while not absolute, is substantial. Both policy creation and policy implementation are vested in executives who, through training and experience, share a common corporate ideology and who collectively appropriate a disproportionate amount of the surplus value generated by productive workers in the form of salaries, fringe benefits, expense accounts, stock options and so on. Moreover, their positions provide them with those opportunities that can come from access to political and other economic elites. Power comes not only from determining the social and technological division of labor within the firm, but also in determining "personnel policy." Control over hiring, firing, promotion, and reward reinforces their power over the technical sphere and is crucial to the maintenance of internal inequality. That this power may be inhibited by trade unions in industry could lead to our underestimating its centrality to the labor process. Management negotiating teams often compromise on wages and benefits (realizing that prices can usually be raised to match wage demands) in order to retain control over personnel matters. Stability and predictability of work force behavior to serve "production" and "efficiency" have been capitalists' goals since the time of Wedgewood. Several complementary managerial ideologies have supported this orientation, from the Weberian ideal of bringing bureaucratic order to organizational chaos, to the Taylorist emphasis on the virtues of hard work (Merkle, 1968; Sutton, et al., 1956), to Fordism and complementary beliefs in the benefits of technology as a source of efficiency. Less frequently stated apprehensions underlie these ideological posi- tions. Workers, particularly those with specialized skills or strong unions, can limit output or even stop production, and at times they have been recalcitrant. While violent strikes, sitdowns, lock-outs, and the invasion of electoral activity by industrial strife are far less common than in the pre-World War II era, recent wild- cats at GM's Lordstown plant and in eastern coalfields suggest that corporate elites cannot entirely rule out the possibility of such actions. More commonly expressed concerns are with worker dissatisfaction, disaffection, and reduced quantity and quality in production (HEW, 1973; Gooding, 1972). Despite the influence of the "new human relations" theorists, prevailing managerial attitudes towards workers are heavily laced with distrust. The latter are not expected to like their work-or any work-preferring instead to be lazy and uninterested in responsibility (Mc Gregor, 1960). Managers often attribute resent- ment and organized resistance neither to alienating characteristics of the work setting nor to inequities of reward, but rather to the human inadequacies and inferiorities of the workers themselves. The precise impact of managerial motivations on policies affecting the lives of workers is of course difficult to specify with any precision since unobtrusive access to the executive suite is almost impossible for Marxist scholars. Similarly it is unclear whether organizational practices result from real intentionality on the part of management, that is the degree to which their decisions are based on clearly thought out and rational assessments of worker attitudes rather than on tradition or imitation. Ruling class publications (Fortune, The Wall Street Journal, more specialized trade journals, especially in personnel management) give conflicting</page><page sequence="8">Managerial Strategies and the Worker 115 messages. But it is clear that current trends in organizing work do not differ markedly from those of a century ago in their focus on providing the worker with as little leverage as possible. There is a continual emphasis, usually through judicious application of mechanical technology to isolate and atomize the worker by making his or her work routine, narrow, and repetitive (Braverman, 1974). These practices reduce skills, increase the replaceability of workers, and thus make demands for worker control less and less easy to generate. Strategies for implementing these goals have developed with considerable sophistication during the history of capitalism and it is to the specific analysis of them that we devote the remainder of this paper. Three techniques are recognizable to Weberian students of bureaucracy: (1) the division of labor into narrowly specific tasks, (2) organizational hierarchy, and (3) rules and procedures, although it is less well-known that Marx devoted two chapters of Capital (1967: Ch. 13, 14) to the division of labor and Engels (1959) made at least passing remarks on hierarchy.10 The other two techniques, (4) secrecy and the hoarding of knowledge, and (5) systematic division of the labor force according to ascriptive characteristics, have been given little attention. The Division of Labor A finite division of labor, with each worker carrying out a highly specialized task over which he or she has mastery is the touchstone of capitalist production. While dating from the earliest factories-we see it for example in Wedgewood's pottery works-it reached its current predominance in this country only in the early twentieth century. Its early success was due largely to Frederick W. Taylor and Henry Ford (Braverman, 1974; Dale, 1960; Merkle, 1968). Their widely publicized successes and considerable influence enabled corporate elites to develop a "super-specialization" going beyond the needs for skill mastery, reducing some work tasks, and the workers who performed them, to an almost machine-like status. The assembly line itself epitomized this trend. The chief economic advantage of such highly specialized production technology appears to be its ability to root the individual worker to a single location, to one machine and to keep him or her working at a relatively fixed pace throughout the daily shift. Unnecessary movement around the shop (or lately the office) is minimized and set-up time is reduced substantially if the worker only interrupts the routine during breaks. Specialization allows a briefer training period for each worker, saving costs for the company.11 Insofar as workers do continually produce (and do not sabotage the product), super-specialization is efficientfor the capitalist and can be a means of generating maximum value from the worker's labor power. It is not, however, efficient for the individual worker. Occupational hazards and diseases and the physical and emotional problems associated with repetitive work (and the shift-work required to keep machinery running twenty-four hours daily) shorten the worker's productive ?OWeber's analysis is based on the Prussian bureaucracy staffed by career officials who accepted the values of the state. The same principles applied to workers have different implications. I1Lest the above description seem a Chaplinesque parody describing a bygone age, the reader should note Braverman's (1947) finding that newly produced machinery requires less training time than older machines. The degradation of the worker, however, is as old as Adam Smith: "The man whose life is spent in performing a few simple operations . . . has no occasion to exert his understanding ... He naturally . . . becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become" (cited in Marglin, 1974: p. 67).</page><page sequence="9">116 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY years (Shostak, 1969; Stellman and Daum, 1973; Wallick, 1972). With a chronic labor surplus, potential sites for runaway shops, and transfer of social and physical consequences to the state (and taxpayers), managers in the U.S. need not be overly concerned with these problems. The social control functions of super-specialization are equally critical. The worker is kept isolated from an understanding of the overall productive process, contributing to a deadening and dissatisfying conception of his or her work and, in many cases the desire to escape factory work (Aronowitz, 1973; Blauner, 1964; Chinoy, 1955). More important, workers themselves are aware that they can be replaced; expendability constitutes a coercive aspect of the work situation and minimizes the potential for serious protest or organization. Unionized workers are offered some protection but insurgent workers whose orientation may be more militant than that of their unions are by no means out of danger. Hierarchy Hierarchy and the concept of a chain of command supports super-specialization by isolating workers from one another and from management. Hierarchical distinc- tions, emphasizing individual rather than collective rewards, exemplify the social control function of corporate firms. Individualism, invidious comparisons of status and salary, and consumerism mutually reinforce hierarchy, a process strongly emphasized by the educational system (Bowles and Gintis, 1975). A stress on hierarchy has been a consistent theme of capitalist development since the period when enterprises decentralized operations to more than a single plant in the late eighteenth century, thereby requiring the entrepreneur to surrender direct supervisory control to designated underlings (McKendrick, 1962; Pollard, 1965). At the same time, the funneling of decision-making functions to the entrepreneur (or his partners or delegates) served to guarantee that he would remain an essential part of the production process (Marglin, 1974). Centralization of the accounting, pricing, purchasing, and selling functions eventually led to the creation of an organizational "staff," thus linking horizontal and vertical differentiation. In the late nineteenth century, capitalists in the steel industry consciously used the creation of job ladders, an explicit form of hierarchy, to break a strong steelwork- ers' union and to destroy the jobbing/subcontracting relationship between owners and the steel masters (Stone, 1973). The emphasis on seniority rights, stressed by modern trade unions, further strengthens distinctions and pits older and younger, white and black, and men and women workers against one another. Hierarchy provides the illusion if not the reality of upward mobility for blue-collar workers. Failure becomes individual rather than systemic (Sennett and Cobb, 1972). Individual workers gain promotion only by manifesting managerially-defined norms of behavior and commitment and by accepting, without protest or grumbling, authoritative commands from above. Moreover, among workers on the shop floor, the acceptance of promotion to supervisory levels (for example to foreman) frequently encourages a shift in their loyalties, thus cutting their emotional ties to former co-workers. A relationship previously based on equality must be redefined on the basis of authority since the supervisory position is based on controlling the quality and quantity of production and on the enforcement of rules (Blau and Scott 1962; Dahrendorf, 1959). Distinctions of rank are not, however, confined to blue-collar and other subordinate positions. A similar pattern exists among middle managers and</page><page sequence="10">Managerial Strategies and the Worker 117 bureaucrats for whom advance in status and responsibility are commensurate with life's success. Capabilities are often hard to assess so promotion is frequently based on personal relationships with superiors, thus raising loyalty and conventionality to highly valued traits. Step-by-step promotion is limited by the existence of relatively rigid caste-like barriers between organizational strata. Production or clerical workers may be promoted to supervisor but seldom to management. Middle managers and professionals, unless they have had elite or highly advanced educational training (and socialization) or show exceptional ability, are rarely promoted to policy-making positions (Goldman, 1973). Rules, Regulations, Supervision: the Hegemony of Bureaucratic Procedure An emphasis on bureaucratic rules and procedures, the effort to standardize behavior in the workplace, occupies a central place in histories of organizational development and analyses of the contemporary workplace. For the bourgeois sociologist, formalization represents order, for Marxists power. Both would agree, however, that rules influence the direct human relationship between worker and manager. In this section we hope to show some of the assumptions behind bureaucratic procedure and the extent to which it is directed not merely to rationalizing work, but to controlling workers. While most rules are geared to social control which suggest that we emphasize that aspect of the bureaucratic process, at least some rules are directly relevant to capital accumulation or have mixed purposes. One such rule is compulsory overtime for which the costs of time-and-a- half wages amount to less than those accrued when larger, forty-hour-a-week work force is employed due to the expense of "fringe benefits" such as health insurance, retirement, workman's compensation (Georgakis and Surkin, 1975).12 Procedural regulations in industry have always been seen as a mechanism to tame the "lazy, slothful" and generally uncommitted and unethusiastic worker. Wedgewood complained of "dilatory, drunken, idle, worthless workman" and had the same problems of absenteeism and tardiness managers lament today (McKen- drick, 1962; Gooding, 1972). Taylor was concerned with "systematic soldiering" and proposed rules to guide the worker's every action (Merkle, 1968). More recently there has been some reaction against these assumptions in the new human relations school but the "theory X" view of human nature still prevails among most managers. These views are neither irrational nor necessarily incorrect, but worker apathy and recalcitrance are rooted more in capitalist social relations than in human nature. Alienated from the decision-making process and from control over the disposition of surplus value they themselves create, why should workers feel great commit- ment to the firm? Frequently they erect individual and collective defenses in direct or indirect resistance to those who hold power over them (Hampden-Turner, 1973; Jenkins, 1973; Weir, 1973). At the same time the corporate effort to maintain strict and orderly control over the work process retards not only the creative potential of workers but the creativity that workers have already shown. Workers frequently violate standard rules and procedures in order to work more efficiently so they may control the pace of their work and to organize their working time individually or collaboratively (Kusterer, 1976; Watson, 1971). Similarly, the workers' control of 12Long hours at physically demanding work certainly reduce the worker's time and energy and may therefore discourage militancy.</page><page sequence="11">118 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY experiments in large scale industry, generally undertaken under special cir- cumstances such as wartime production, demonstrates the organizational capacity of workers (Friedmann, 1961). Workers' cooperatives have survived under the handicaps of small size and heavy competition where entrepreneurship has failed (Bernstein, 1974). These successes, however, threaten the essence of the capitalist system because the worker's ability to organize production, to institute their own procedures, suggests that corporate executives and capitalists are not necessary to the production process. Rules and procedures and their corollary-supervision and surveillance-buffer the system against this threat by making hierarchical relations a constant factor in everyday corporate life. Rules exemplify power since their arbitrary enforcement allows management to discipline those workers who organize either on or off the job with a minimum of union interference. In non-unionized workplaces, power is more arbitrary and rules provide a minimal legitimacy. Statistical records and electronic surveillance are modes of control that enable the firm to monitor its employees with fewer supervisory personnel (Blau, 1955; Blau and Schoenherr, 1970; Langer, 1970). Rules may at times provide the worker with protection against arbitrary authority, as Crozier (1964) suggests; but the atmosphere of silent class struggle, which generated protective rules in the first place, at times encourages workers to limit their production by carefully following the specified procedures. This is one of the ironic contradictions of capitalism (Merton, 1957). Bourgeois organizational theorists have been aware of the need for abstract standards of performance and of their potential contradictions-or "dysfunc- tions." March and Simon (1958) and Thompson (1967), focusing on the external environment evince a concern with internal relations. In discussing the need to provide "unobtrusive controls," the former engenders an atmosphere of com- pliance, while in recognizing the difficulty of assessing work-unit performance the latter clearly demonstrates an awareness of the limits of organizational control (Perrow, 1972). Sociologists studying organizational dysfunctions have amply demonstrated the difficulties of enforcing strict adherence to organizational rules or relying heavily on statistical records of performance (Blau, 1955; 1962; Crozier, 1964; Gouldner, 1954). Nevertheless, formal rules and procedures serve a residual function for management: they can be strengthened or relaxed, enforced or ignored at management's discretion, in response to either perceived inefficiency or worker resistance. Thus they become a managerial resource both in the workplace and at the bargaining table, although in the latter instance specific regulations may be sacrificed without conceding management's right to set policy bearing on work- place rules and procedures. The Uses of Secrecy and the Hoarding of Knowledge Knowledge is power and, under capitalism, the location of knowledge becomes a strategic resource, particularly in setting "decision-premises" (March and Simon, 1958). Two types of information are critical for the industrial enterprise. The first is technical know-how essential to the production process which incorporates whatever scientific knowledge is necessary for product design and development and whatever expertise is required to operate and to maintain productive machinery. The second can be called (imprecisely) financial knowledge and</page><page sequence="12">Managerial Strategies and the Worker 119 includes the data on the costs of materials and labor, on corporate sales and profits, on interfirm arrangements and contracts, and on production records. Technical knowledge tends to be diffused among the workers and technical staff; financial knowledge is concentrated in the hands of policy-making executives and capitalists. Crozier's (1964) study of French industry provides a graphic example of the power that accrues to holders of technical knowledge. Mechanics in the nationalized tobacco monopoly, protected by civil service regulations, could affect production and even management had only limited influence over them. In American industry we see a constant trend toward reducing the impact of such power through automation and managerial control. Stone's (1973) description of the early steel industry and Braverman's (1974) and Aronowitz's (1973) discussions of "degraded" or "trivialized" work suggest management's awareness of the potential power of technical knowledge. At the same time there is an increasing concentration of technical knowledge in research and development endeavors that are staffed by professional and semi-professional workers in engineering and the sciences. Facilities are often physically separated from production plants (Burns and Stalker, 1961). Knowledge is necessary and production technologies are interdependent. Taking the realm of technical data away from the shop floor and productive workers generates new contradictions. Technical personnel, who are organized in terms of a strict division of labor, a rigid and noticeable hierarchy, and a set of procedural rules begin to experience alienated feelings similar to those of workers (Miller, 1967; II Manifesto, 1972). The lack of communication between managers, tech- nicians, and workers, compounded by frequent dislike or contempt, does not en- courage the latter to speak up when they are ordered to carry out activities they know are technical mistakes. In discussing the privatization of knowledge and orga- nizational secrecy, we should note that workers seem to develop their own "work- ing knowledge" of the machines, materials, and final products with which they work. Kusterer (1976) and Priori (1975) suggest that workers themselves develop highly sophisticated work-specific skills on the job and often have a clearer under- standing of the technical requisites of production than either managers or tech- nicians. Limited access to financial and production data plays an equally important role in maintaining the corporate status quo. In an era of diversified corporations, it becomes difficult for workers, trade union officials, and even some managers to disentangle the actual financial status of a firm or plant from the aggregate figures published in annual reports. Those who wish to challenge managerial decisions on rational grounds may thus have inadequate data from which to plead their case. The data themselves are not always neutral since the wide variety of acceptable accounting methods allows manipulation of figures to make corporations or constituent departments appear to be doing better or worse than they actually are (Blair, 1972). Even bringing in management consultants results in conflicting messages since their entry is frequently the consequence of one managerial clique's desire to add firepower to its own definition of the situation (Crider and Van Houten, 1974). The secrecy of executive salaries and frequently extravagant fringe benefits and expense accounts and of the real rates of profit and return-on-invested capital reduces a potential source of worker anger and militancy. Demands to "open up the books" have been recently expressed by anti-corporate researchers and have long been a tenet of the organized worker control movement (Mandel,</page><page sequence="13">120 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY 1973). The danger such open knowledge poses for the corporate system has been amply demonstrated by the decline in public confidence in American business (and government) that has followed "whistle-blowing" and activities of some relatively highly placed (but disgruntled) managers and officials (Sjoberg and Miller, 1973). Both the size of the modern corporation and the quantity and diversity of information generate their own contradictions through the growth of clerical and data processing personnel employed by every corporation. Information must be gathered, processed, aggregated, typed, and reproduced by workers who may, in some cases, identify with the aspirations of production workers and be willing and able to "leak" pertinent facts to militants or outsiders. The corporation or the government cannot guarantee total security since the need of managers to communicate with one another by written documents, to commit themselves and one another to positions by formally filed memos, and to base decisions on the most complete knowledge possible requires the generation of internal documents and people to produce them physically. Under these circumstances we should then not wonder why the Watergate conspirators left around such incriminating material. Maintenance of Ethnic and Sexual Division of Labor Inequalities in job availabilities between women and men, third world and white (and even between white ethnic groups) have generally be seen by bourgeois sociologists as the result of sequential entry into northern industrial plants. If women and Blacks (Asians, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans) have inferior job oppor- tunities, it results from a more recent migration to industrial centers and a consequent inability to compete with already established groups there. Some residual racial, ethnic, or sexual prejudice among both managers and potential co-workers, with management being unwilling to subject their firms to internal racial conflict, is often considered as a contributing factor. There has been little study of the ways in which capitalists have attempted actively to perpetuate existing inequalities although it is now accepted that equality of individual qualifications does not guarantee equality in the labor market. Labor historians have documented managerial efforts to keep the labor force divided and political economists have shown the organizational strategies used and their consequences. One recent article (Langer, 1976) argues that business funding of groups fighting the Equal Rights Amendment is motivated by a desire to short-circuit the movement towards equal job status, and consequently equal pay, for women. Reich (1972) and others have attempted to explain inequalities by suggesting that a dual labor market exists in the United States: one (primarily) for white males, another for non-whites and women. This segmented market divides corporations into the monopoly sector, employing white males and recruiting long-term labor from internal labor markets; and the competitive sector, generally containing smaller, less stable firms, which recruit labor from outside the company and have a greater reliance on non-whites and women workers. More recently Edwards (1975) has suggested that the stable demand for labor in the monopoly sector generates more bureaucratized modes of organizational control with greater internal vertical and horizontal differentiation, and less visible supervision. This structure may give workers the view that their positions are separate from, but roughly equal to those of their co-workers, although even minor differences may encourage invidious distinctions when jobs are increasingly stratified ethnically or sexually (Acker and Van Houten, 1974; Aronowitz, 1973; Kanter, 1974).</page><page sequence="14">Managerial Strategies and the Worker 121 More important, ethnic and sexual divisions between workers in the unionized, monopoly sectors of the economy and those in the unorganized, competitive sectors may produce different immediate interests. Managers can use these differences to exploit the contradictory requirements of seniority systems and affirmative action. Even in the more competitive agricultural sector, large growers can foment racial tensions between farmworkers by their lobbying on immigration policy. Nonetheless, external conditions can at times limit the operation of the dual economy during periods of labor shortage, most notably during wartime, when managers must hire racial minorities, southern and Appalachian whites, and women in positions traditionally held by white males. Conclusion In the analysis presented above we have generalized about the organization of work in capitalist societies based on the literature on American corporations. Little attention has been given either governmental bureaus or organizations elsewhere in the capitalist world. The interpenetration of American, European, and Japanese firms through multinational corporations implies that they too have roughly similar forms of work organization, in part shaped by imitating successful American business practices.13 We do recognize that, despite the overall similarities, there are variations among American firms. Managerial philosophies on the desirability and feasibility of Taylorism, on incentives, and on paternalism do differ.'4 Structural differences in the size or technical complexity of production facilities no doubt affect managerial control strategies as so many organizational theorists have argued. Thus the portrait of the mode of corporate control over workers should be seen as an ideal type against which observations may be measured and comparisons between types of organizations drawn. This leads us to the need for further research and theory, and to a catalog of research projects that can both test the validity of the Marxist approach we have laid out and enrich our knowledge about the bureaucratic organization of work. Constraints of space, and in some cases of our own expertise, allow us to do no more than list what we see as the potentially most useful areas for research. The first need is research that can disentangle capital accumulation from social control strategies. The problem of learning managers' intentions and of understanding the consequences and contradictions of specific personnel policies and policy changes makes this a particularly difficult issue. The second need is a greater theoretical understanding of the similarities and differences between workers in the state sector and those in the corporate sector. Much day-to-day work appears similar, but it is important to learn how the different functions of each sector affect work organization. Third, is the need for more direct comparisons between work organizations, from the full range of socialist economies to those in capitalist economies in both manufacturing and government administration. Such compari- sons allow us to test the Weberian proposition of work rationalization against the Marxian proposition that socialism can provide humane working conditions while supplying human needs. It would also allow us to understand better the meaning of "efficiency" in production. Finally, there is a need to meld our understanding of 13An example is the institution of Planning-Programming-Budgeting Systems first at Ford, then at the Defense Department, and now in smaller government agencies including those in education. 14Zimbalist (1975) argues that Taylorism has largely been replaced by "humanistic management", which itself is unstable and generates new contradictions.</page><page sequence="15">122 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY capitalist bureaucracy with a vision of future society, the true test of Marxist theory. If our understanding is correct, it will be as useful to workers struggling for greater control over their daily lives by exposing the vulnerabilities of contempo- rary work organization as bourgeois sociology has been for capitalists and managers. And we should try to develop a tentative blueprint for non-exploitative, participatory work organization in a socialist society built from the transformation of an affluent, highly technological capitalist economy.
