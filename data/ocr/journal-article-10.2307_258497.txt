OBERT Consultant and Author Examination of Mitroff's archetypal social system analysis (ASA) reveals its hierarchical vision of a single reality and several of its key constructs to be inconsistent with archetypal psychology's dualistic vision of reality. Alternative views of these issues, more consistent with mainstream depth psychology, are offered. Analysis of a dyadic social system develops the concept of an organizationalpsyche. Mitroff's applications of ASA are then reexamined to illustrate the greater significance of the current view. Mitroff has offered a much needed introduction to an evolving new approach to the understanding of human systems, called by him archetypal social systems analysis (ASA). His model is exploratory: "This paper is suggestive of only one approach. Its purpose is to stimulate other efforts" (1983, p. 389). Such an alternative effort, unbeknownst to Mitroff, has been underway for some time. This paper uses a critique of his approach as both a starting point and a counterpoint for the clarification and elabora- tion of archetypal social systems analysis. Mitroff tends to understate the extent to which ASA represents a radical departure from the norms and values of the dominant traditions of behavioral science, although his appeal for "transdisciplinary" (p. 396) methodologies suggests that he certainly is aware of this issue. The widespread adoption of ar- chetypal social systems analysis would signal nothing less than a paradigm shift affecting every social science discipline (Neumann, 1969) and reminiscent of the integration of science that has been the pro- mise of general systems theory for 30 years. Obstacles to the development and understanding of ASA include its philosophical assumptions, which are largely incompatible with the traditional nature of empirical validation within social science. As a result, its future will depend heavily on the establish- ment of face validity: whether it will make sense and prove useful to others in their efforts to understand human systems. In that regard the independent and simultaneous development of related concepts by Mitroff and the current author represents a step toward consensual validation of the theory; and it is an indicator, however slight, of the readiness of the social scientific community for its contribution. Critique of Mitroff Mitroff's lack of specificity about the paradigmatic significance of ASA is symptomatic of a central prob- lem in his approach; he appears to believe that arche- typal social systems analysis can be assimilated into the predominant social scientific traditions. This is best exemplified by his extension of the meaning of the term "stakeholder," those human systems that have a "stake in" (or influence on) behavior (Ackoff &amp; Emery, 1974; Mitroff, 1983), to encompass the ar- chetypes, universal forms or images symbolic of hu- man experience. Mitroff himself makes abundantly clear that the archetypes are of a totally different nature than previous conceptions of the stakeholders: "The further one delves into the nature of arche- types, the stranger their properties become" (1983, p. 392). By the time his analysis is complete the only remaining similarity between archetypes and stake- holders is that they both exert influences on behavior; to group them together as though the former were a subtype of the latter is to deprive both of their meaning and value. In this and other areas Mitroff's errors stem from his disregard of basic tenets of Jungian psychology, which offers the only comprehensive approach to the archetypes. There it is clear that archetypes cannot be stakeholders because they are not human systems 757</page><page sequence="2">at all, but rather must be regarded as the products of human systems. In the depth psychological litera- ture they often are said to be "anthropomnorphized," meaning "to attribute human form or attributes to" (Stern, 1969, p. 63), as in the sentence: 'Mitroff's consideration of the archetypes as stakeholders an- thropomorphizes their true character.' His lack of clarity on this issue is most apparent when he says: "There exists an extensive variety... .of psychological and psychoanalytic evidence that affirms that the deepest layers of the human psyche, experience in groups and organizations, are both experienced and constituted ... in terms of intensely human, if not an- thropomorphic, characters" (Mitroff, 1983, p. 388). Something can be either human or anthropomorphic: it cannot be both. Superficially, identification of the archetypes as stakeholders would seem to move toward an integra- tion of social science. However, the fundamental er- ror that Mitroff makes, the confusion of logical types, has been extensively addressed by Bateson (1980) in his own movement toward a more unified science. The maintenance of spurious relationships between distinct phenomena conceals their important differences and prevents the recognition of more meaningful similarities. In short, nothing is gained by calling the archetypes stakeholders, and a great deal is potentially lost. For example, the confusion of logical types leads Mitroff (1983) into a maze of contradictions. Seek- ing a "continuum" of the "different levels of soci- ety," he arrives at Character Types I-V: institutions, organizations, roles, ego-states, and archetypes. Al- though he does not adequately define the selection criteria for components on this continuum, its mem- bers and contextual discussion suggest that it is in- tended as a hierarchical model. Logical analysis sheds additional light on Mitroffs continuum, because for Continuum A-C the mem- bers should satisfy the relation that A is to B as B is to C. Although there would be some argument, this condition approximately holds in several of the cases suggested by Mitroff's continuum. For exam- ple: 'archetypes may be seen as sub-parts contributing to the formation of ego-states'; 'roles may be seen as sub-parts contributing to the formation of organizations.' However, the confusion of logical types suddenly shows up in the further application of this formula: 'ego-states may be seen as sub-parts contributing to the formation of roles,' which makes no sense whatsoever. Thus there is a fundamental discontinuity in Mitroff's continuum which lies be- tween the components' "roles" and "ego-states." In- stitutions, organizations, and roles (which here will be termed "material reality") are of a logical type different from ego-states and archetypes (here called "psychic reality"). Such a placement of aspects of psychic reality on a single continuum with aspects of material reality obscures their essential duality and creates the illu- sion of unidimensionality. This is deeply contrary to the precepts of depth psychology on which Mitroff's ASA appears to be based. As Jung wrote: In my picture of the world there is a vast outer realm and an equally vast inner realm; between these two stands man, facing now one and now the other, and, according to his mood or disposition, taking the one for the absolute truth by denying or sacrificing the other (1933, p. 120). Indeed, Mitroff finds himself in the exact bind that Jung describes, trying to answer a question raised by his spurious continuum: are the archetypes as stake- holders "real"? Caught in his own dilemma, Mitroff provides both answers: "One need not regard arche- types as literally 'real' (i.e., actual existing stakeholders)" (1983, p. 391). A few pages later he states: "It is highly tempting and thereby all the more dangerously false to consider one... characteristic kind of stakeholders ... as somehow 'more real' than all the others" (1983, p. 395). Mitroff's hierarchical vision of reality, placing the archetypes and ego-states on subsystem levels below those of material reality, creates further difficulties for his analysis. For example, in closing he seeks to find isomorphisms among these levels, rather than understanding their fundamental differences. Simi- larly, because material stakeholders can appropriately be analyzed into subsystems, he extends this method to the archetypes, arriving at the unnecessary con- cept of the archetype's psyche, previously unknown to depth psychology, In this he neglects to explain how a universal symbolic image could possibly have a psyche. The Archetypal Pageant Mitroff's "stakeholder" assumptions also create difficulties in the view he conveys of the psyche itself, which is regarded as a composite of many archetypes and perceptions of real people who have been intro- jected (taken inside) from the environment. This 758</page><page sequence="3">leads him to adopt Ogilvy's description: "The psyche can be construed as a 'miniature society, a plurality of selves, each with a significant if somewhat partial existence and life of its own" (Ogilvy, 1977, p. 118; Mitroff, 1983, p. 390). Mitroff's desire to extend stakeholder analysis to the psyche is very well served by the mini-society idea: it makes it appear appropriate to apply the same prin- ciples used in understanding the material society to psychic reality. Unfortunately, the mini-society is but a metaphor, and not a very well chosen one. The quote from Jung above illustrates the belief among depth psychologists that the operating principles of psychic reality are of a totally different nature than those generally used to understand material reality. Perhaps most importantly, the process of under- standing through separation and categorization is completely foreign to the unconscious mind in which the archetypes operate. Although these processes cer- tainly are necessary to gain a rational picture of un- conscious functioning, it is critical to remember that they are completely alien to the nature of the sub- ject in question. Thus Jung (1968) did not regard the archetype as a formal construct so much as an im- age that described a process repeatedly observed in his practice. Failure to make this distinction led Mitroff both to the metaphor of the mini-society and to his percep- tion in Nichols' (1980) book of something "tantaliz- ingly close to a 'periodic table of human elements" (Mitroff, p. 392), which, as he himself acknowledges, is totally inconsistent with the nature of the ar- chetypes. However, Nichols' work and that of others (Campbell, 1968, 1976; Jung, 1967; Neumann, 1954) does help to visualize a more useful metaphor for the nature of psychic reality. In contrast to the boundary exchanges one might expect in a "mini-society," or the static quality of a "periodic table," these works depict the dynamic archetypal images as they merge into a transformative pattern underlying and support- ing human developmental processes. As an example, the distinction between the archetype of the cocoon and that of the butterfly is not nearly as significant in depth psychology as is the dynamic process that connects them. This can be seen through consideration of an ex- tremely important archetype: the image of the in- dividual's ego or self-concept, the same figure that appears to be the self in dreams (Jung, 1968). Cen- tral to the ego's behavior as an archetype is its fre- quent intermingling with the character of other ar- chetypes. For example, the self may also be repre- sented by another archetypal figure, that of the adventurous hero on his developmental journey. Under these conditions still other archetypes are the fair maidens, the evil ogres, the treacherous enemies, the wise old men, the magical powers, the angry or cooperating gods and goddesses, and the valuable treasure in search of which the hero ventures forth. These figures act within the psyche as do players in a Greek tragedy, helping the drama to unfold. Thus the psyche may be pictured as an archetypal pageant of the ego's adventures on the pathway to "becom- ming". This metaphor is intended to emphasize the nature of the archetypes as an ever-changing process as opposed to the complex structure suggested by Ogilvy's "mini-society." When psychic reality is regarded as parallel to material reality, the archetypes are not seen as sub- parts of the individual, as in Mitroff's model. Rather, the actual behavior of the individual is the linking pin between the two realities, which share in its deter- mination. The normal person must seek the course of action that most nearly satisfies the current plot of the archetypal pageant while negotiating the en- vironmental exchanges characteristic of the stakeholders' reality. Thus, in ASA the classic for- mulation that behavior is a function of person and environment becomes: Behavior =f(Ego-in-Psyche X Person-in-Environment) A continuous state of tension exists between the two elements within parentheses. The well-functioning in- dividual maintains a state of balance or equilibrium between the two sets of forces. Dysfunctional behav- ior occurs whenever either becomes predominant. The relative simplicity of this formula is clouded by two principles accurately described by Mitroff, the mechanisms of introjection and projection, resulting in mutual contamination between psychic and ma- terial realities. Introjection, for example, transplants images from the external environment into the psyche as part of the personal unconscious, amplifying the archetypes with personalistic images. Indeed, the con- cept of the psyche as a "micro-society" is, in fact, such an introjection. An opposite principle, pro- jection-the perception of disowned parts of the self within the external world-animates that world with images whose source is the psyche, such that it might 759</page><page sequence="4">similarly be called a "macro-psyche." This con- tinuous contamination between the two fields in- evitably results in interpenetrations between the dif- ferent realities. For example, specific individuals come to correspond to the actors within the arche- typal pageant: the real-world mentor stands in rela- tionship to the internal archetype of the wise old man; one's wife becomes a fair damsel, possibly in distress; the boss may be activated with the image of a patriar- chal god; and a planned career change could be the treasure hard to attain, the goal of the journey. Such one-to-one correspondences act further to limit the individual's behavioral options. The Hierarchy of the Psyche Perhaps the greatest problem with Mitroff's ap- proach is the failure to establish face validity through the provision of clear examples of significant conse- quence. The depth psychological concepts informing both this and Mitroff's paper are drawn primarily from the psychoanalysis of individuals. However, higher level applications of ASA will require a clear concept of the organizational psyche, only introduced by Mitroff at the conclusion of his paper and without adequate definition or illustrations. Indeed, the con- cept is largely inconsistent with his unidimensional, hierarchical model, which treats the psyche as a sub- system of the individual. The relevance of the psyche to the organization may be illustrated most easily within the simplest possible social system, two individuals in the process of initiating interaction. A germane example is the relationship between Mitroff and the current author as a dyad with no previous history, but likely to form as a result of mutual interest in ASA. These two pa- pers constitute the first interactions between them. In the dyadic interactions of Jungian psychother- apy the first major archetype to reveal itself is usually that of the shadow (Jaffe, 1975). In like manner, in interaction between two individuals the initial ex- changes are enshrouded by the shadow, not yet hav- ing resolved itself into a clear figure. This was the situation when Mitroff and the current author first became acquainted with one another's papers. In terms of material reality these were informational in- puts into the other's processes. Relevant to each's hero journey, this new input presumably was intro- jected into their archetypal pageants: here it was as though, as so often happened to the Knights of the Round Table, a dark figure had suddenly appeared at the edge of a wood toward which each had been riding. At first it stood too deeply in the shade for one to see exactly who or what it was. The heroic knight/egos cried out to one another, "Identify thyself," while on the level of material reality they initiated interaction by writing these papers. So early in the dialogue between the two authors it is not consciously known what archetypal figures have appeared to them at the edge of the forest. How- ever, interactions tend to be infused with unconscious messages conveying the type of figure needed within each individual's pageant, and they create subtle pressures for the other to respond in role. For ex- ample, this "reply" is crying out, "Identify thyself," but its style and content undoubtedly provide clues about the character actually sought. Overly harsh criticisms of Mitroff could imply that the current author's knight/ego is seeking a terrifying dragon with whom he is destined to do battle. Alternatively, to the extent that this "reply" builds on Mitroff's approach, it may be calling for the archetype of the twin or fellow traveller: in the ancient Sumerian legend of Gilgamesh the hero is sent a brother of equal strength and beauty to share in his adventures. This archetype underlies colleagueship, the potential for the two authors to join together in the develop- ment of a unified approach to ASA. There is in actuality no single figure sought at the edge of the forest. Both of the above figures and others are present in this paper to varying degrees. In interaction with Mitroff each exerts a subtle pres- sure on him to respond in kind: for example, overly harsh criticism may stimulate him to write a retalia- tory rejoinder, providing the current author with the sought-after dragon. The likelihood of this is consi- derably increased if Mitroff's pageant has a current need for a challenger and perceives such a figure with- in this "reply." At this point a complementary rela- tionship, most appropriately termed an archetypal system, would have been established. It would exist in the psychic realm contiguous to the material dyad of the two authors in interaction about ASA. Isomorphic to the view of the individual psyche developed above, the new archetypal system would consist of Mitroff and the current author as "sub- personalities" interacting in archetypally-patterned ways. Whether acting out the dragon/giant-killer pat- tern, the twins pattern, or some combination of these and others, they would have become to the group 760</page><page sequence="5">(dyad) what the archetypes are to the individual. Be- sides them there would be another "figure" present, the group's collective sense of itself, isomorphic to the individual ego. Whatever their interaction, it will continuously affect this group self-concept, influenc- ing it through their reenactment of archetypal behav- ioral patterns. In this way the formula for individual behavior cited above may be extended to the group level of analysis: the group's behavior is a function of the ego-in-psyche (group self-concept in archety- pally-patterned interaction with its members) and sys- tem-in-environment (the ASA dyad in interaction with the professional world). The behavior of the group will be an attempt to satisfy both levels, be- tween which a state of tension exists. In exactly this manner one could continue up the hierarchy of living systems through organizations, in- stitutions, nation-states, societies, and civilization. For example, the ASA dyad might eventually find itself in archetypally-patterned interaction with another group, with which it could merge, forming an organization. The behavior of this new system would then be a function of its self-concept in ar- chetypally-patterned interaction with its subparts (the two groups that merged to form it) and its exchanges with its material environment. Through this process a hierarchy of the psyche, parallel to and in interac- tion with the social system hierarchy, can be intuited. This is Jung's "equally vast inner realm," usually denied by the objectifying scientific eye. An organization's psyche may now be understood to consist of its subsystems interacting with one another and its self-concept in archetypally-patterned ways. As in the case of the archetypes in the indivi- dual psyche, these interactions take place on what must be considered an unconscious level. Organiza- tions are no more likely to be aware of the archetypal patterns beneath subunits' interactions than are indi- viduals aware of the pageant within their own psyche. Such archetypally-patterned interactions between subunits constitute the organizational unconscious. Applications Because Mitroff left the concept of the organiza- tional psyche so ambiguous, little new was learned about the situations used to illustrate ASA, thereby failing to establish face validity. By way of illustra- tion, Mitroff quotes Hirsch's analysis of the symbolic language of mergers, which takes "on the far more colorful forms available from such genres as the western (ambush and shootout replace offer and actions taken), the love affair and/or mar- riage, warfare (replete with sieges, barricades, flak, and soldierly honor), mystery and piracy on the high seas (with raiders and safe harbors). Generic formula- tions also entail the frequent appearance of mercen- aries or hired guns (investment houses to whom most of the negotiating is delegated), and black and white knights (culled from tales of chivalry in which the distressed damsel is either undone or rescued)" (Hirsch, 1983, p. 236). Discussing these examples of organizational mer- gers Mitroff suggests: When one is in a situation that is so rife with poten- tial uncertainty, exhilaration, conflict, and hard feel- ings, one should expect to see archetypal imagery used to cope with the intensity of the feelings expressed and to attempt to contain them" (1983, p. 394) Thus Mitroff regards this instance of archetypal im- agery as the creation of defense mechanisms intended to protect individuals from the emotional intensity of the merger situation. This approach betrays a pre- dominantly Freudian bias, focusing on defense mech- anisms instead of opportunities for growth. The theory of archetypal social systems analysis here advanced leads to alternative conclusions about such use of metaphor in the organizational context. It is well known that Freudian slips occur in periods of high stress, much like the merger situation as described by Mitroff. When taken seriously, the con- cept of the organizational unconscious suggests that the language of the takeover process may be what Nichols (1980) calls a Jungian slip, an expression of the archetypal themes currently activated within the (organizational) psyche. This leads to conclusions quite different from those of Mitroff; the appearance of material from the unconscious is not regarded as a simple mechanism of defense against stress. Rather, from a depth psychological perspective it expresses important aspects of the human experience of the situation likely to influence system behavior, in- cluding that of key decision makers. For example, the CEO may take different actions depending on the archetypes with which the organizational self-image is currently infused. A fair damsel in distress acts dif- ferently from a proud ship attacked by pirates on the high seas; the current analysis suggests that there may be organizational analogs to these differences. Mitroff raises but leaves unresolved the implica- tions of ASA for the merger process. The simple case of the formation of a two-person relationship dis- cussed above serves as an illustration of the issues 761</page><page sequence="6">inherent in this question. For the concurrent establishment of an archetypal system it would ap- pear necessary that the major archetypes infusing the self-concepts of the proposed sub-systems be com- plementary. Those mergers that do take place without this condition being met probably are either unsuc- cessful or are those that are designed to have little impact on the functioning of either organization. But even complementary self-concepts may not always bode well for a successful merger. For example, in myth and legend the child of a brave knight and a fair damsel often is especially blessed, but many is the monster born of a raped goddess. That is, it may even be possible to assess the merits of a proposed merger through an analysis of the specific images us- ed to describe it. Mitroff makes one further application of ASA that requires additional comment, pointing out that pro- jections may create dysfunctional distortions in the organization's view of its competition. As was seen in the analysis of a dyadic relationship, projections also exert a pressure for the other system to behave as it is perceived. Acting toward the competition as though it were cutthroat may encourage cutthroating. In terms of its implications for international rela- tions, this point is further developed in Jung's The Undiscovered Self (1957), an important little book that should be required reading for politicians. Many CEOs also would benefit from serious consideration of its implications for management. Mitroff concludes with the question, "Precisely what are organizational symbols symbolic of?" (1983, p. 395). This he answers with the tautology "that symbols are symbolic (i.e., expressive) of the archetypes that signify an organization" (1983, p. 395). The current approach to ASA offers an alter- native answer: such symbols are manifestations of an unconscious dimension in organizational life of which, thus far, there has been only the faintest ink- ling. It may seen unfounded to attribute such far- reaching significance to them. But it is important to note that a similar method of analysis gave Jung grave cause for concern about the European situa- tion long before the outbreak of World War II (Jaffe, 1971). If his concepts are thus relevant to both the individual and cultural levels, it is inevitable that they will come to have important applications to the organization as well.
