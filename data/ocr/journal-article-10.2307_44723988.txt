<plain_text><page sequence="1">741189 Static Force-Penetration Response of the Human Knee Dr. Gerald W. Nyquist Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories THE OBJECT of the research was to provide biomechanical guidelines for evaluating the acceptability of anthropometric dummy knees from the standpoints of anthropometry and response to quasi-static loads. A research program was conducted to generate biomechan- ical guidelines for the development of anthropometric dummy knees. Current dummy knees reflect the human form to var- ious degrees; however, little effort has been expended investi- gating the response of the knee to applied loads because there have been no biomechanical guidelines available with which to access the degree of fidelity of the response. The impor- tance of investigating knee response stems from the fact that, in a vehicle crash environment (frontal impact), the femur (upper leg bone) is often loaded in compression as a result of knee-instrument panel impact. FMVSS 208(1)* currently limits the maximum allowable femur compressive force to 1700 lb (7562 N) in compliance testing of passenger cars with passive restraints. Knee design and instrument panel de- sign are both important factors in determining the magnitude of the peak femur force. A well-designed panel could fail to meet the federal requirement if the dummy knee was poorly *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. designed. Conversely, a poorly designed panel could pass the federal requirement with an improperly designed knee. The need for biomechanical guidelines is therefore obvious. The merits and/or shortcomings of a proposed instrument panel design, from the standpoint of occupant protecting against knee-thigh-hip injury, can be evaluated confidently only if the test dummy knee response is representative of its human counterpart. Deformable energy-absorbing panels are utilized to limit femur force magnitudes, and therefore the knee actually pen- etrates the panel during impact. Geometry and stiffness of the knee are important factors influencing the force-deflec- tion characteristics of this penetration. Therefore, a docu- ment of the quasi-static penetration characteristics of a rep- " resentative cross section of human knees, pressed into a de- formable material having known force-deflection properties, ι is a pertinent design guideline to require as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to assure biomechanical fidelity of knee response. The dynamic response of the knee-femur system to short- duration impulsive loads must also be investigated. The orig- inal research of Kroell, Patrick, and Mertz (2), upon which the 1700 lb (7562 N) femur force limit is based, documented the peak force generated behind an impact target struck by the knee, whereas the current federal requirements designate ABSTRACT . Biomechanical guidelines for the development of an anthro- pometric dummy knee have been lacking. Quasi-static tests were performed on adult male volunteers and embalmed ca- davers to define the force-penetration characteristics of the knee when loaded by a rigid, crushable foam of known crush properties. The test subject was seated erect with the thigh horizontal and lower leg unrestrained. Axial thigh (femur) force and knee penetration were recorded as a block of foam was pressed against the knee. The test was conducted incremen- tally with increasing peak load, and a new foam block was used for each increment. This enabled evaluation of the foam indent volume as a function of peak load. Pertinent anthropometric data are presented for each sub- ject, and normal distribution theory is used to develop per- centile scaling rules for the knee response. Loading corridors for biomechanically sound 50th percentile performance are suggested. 3780</page><page sequence="2">that the force be monitored at a specific point along the shaft of the femur- 4.25 in (107.9 mm) proximal to the knee cen- ter-of-rotation. If the dynamic force transmissibility charac- teristics of the dummy knee-femur system are unlike those of the human, the dummy will be an inappropriate tool for mea- surement in relation to the 1700 lb (7562 N) biomechanical limit. King, Fan, and Vargovick (3) have studied this prob- lem. Dynamic response is a subject beyond the scope of this pro- gram, which dealt solely with an evaluation of the quasi-static characteristics. TEST DESCRIPTION Quasi-static tests were performed on adult male human knees. The test enabled evaluation of the force-penetration characteristics associated with pressing the knee into a block of rigid, crushable foam of known crush properties. Thigh compressive force versus knee penetration into the foam and thigh force versus foam indent volume were deter- mined for each knee evaluated. A 4 in (101 .6 mm) thick foam block was pressed horizontally, in the direction of the femur axis, against the knee. The thigh (femur) was horizon- tal and the lower leg hung downward unrestrained and re- laxed. Penetration was defined as the horizontal distance the uncrushed portion of the foam block moved relative to the femur (the foam was initially in contact with the knee). Per- manent* indent volumes of the foam for various femur loads were obtained by conducting the test incrementally and re- placing the foam after each increment. Foam mechanical properties were documented by establish- ing the force versus crush relationship for a 4 in diameter flat disc pressed into the material and establishing the thickness recovery versus time relationship ensuing after crushing a 4 in thickness of the material to 2 in and releasing the load. A description of the specific foam purchased for this program is given in Table 1. The need for these material properties evaluations is discussed below.

Loading corridors were developed from the biomechanical test data to describe the knee force-penetration and force- indent volume characteristics. Detailed procedures for con- ducting the knee loading and foam material properties evalua- tion phases of the test are presented later. Sufficient anthro- pometric data were taken to document the geometry of the knees tested and to enable comparison of the test sample (eight subjects) to the population using HEW statistics (4). TEST SUBTLETIES There are some pertinent comments to be made with regard to the test description given above. It is important that the following points be understood if one is to interpret the test data properly or conduct comparable tests. First, penetration is defined as femur displacement relative to the uncrushed foam. Femur relative displacement is some- what greater than that of the outer surface of the flesh cover- ing the patella (knee cap) because of flesh compressibility; therefore, penetration will be somewhat larger than foam crush. Flesh compression is likely almost negligible for the human knee but may not be negligible for the dummy knee. Second, the foam indent volume must not be construed to be representative of knee volume (either loaded or unloaded). The knee flesh distorts and compresses somewhat during load- ing; in addition, the crushed foam recovers to some degree up- on unloading (hence, the need for a foam recovery material property specification). Indent volumes were measured after all significant recovery took place (1 h or more after unload- ing). The third point, of paramount importance to those propos- ing to conduct comparable evaluations of dummy knees, is with regard to the material properties of the foam. It is cau- tioned that simply purchasing foam meeting the description of Table 1 does not assure that the material will qualify. Strength-related material properties of the foam are not de- fined in the manufacturer's specifications and may vary from one billet to the next. In fact, foams of this type are typical- ly anisotropic with respect to crush strength; that is, the strength is a function of the direction of the applied load relative to the specimen. It is important that one qualify his 3781</page><page sequence="3">3782 DR. GERALD W.

TEST SUBJECT SELECTION The test subjects consisted of six adult male volunteers and two adult embalmed cadavers (limbered), as indicated in Table 2. The subjects were selected to provide a range in height and weight. The sample had a mean erect standing height of 69.7 in (1.770 m) with a 3.1 in (0.079 m) standard deviation. The mean weight was 15 1 lb (672 N) with a 24 lb (107 N) standard deviation. The distributions were assumed to be normal*, and the corresponding height and weight ver- Table 2 - Summary of Test Subjects Erect Age Subject Standing Weight,* Bracket, (All Male) Test Date Height, in lb years Volunteer CJM 2/2/73 71.5 170 60-70 Volunteer GWN 2/5/73 74.0 177 30-40 Volunteer LMP 1/25/73 68.5 161 50-60 Volunteer GP 2/2/73 65.1 116 20-30 Volunteer KRT 2/2/73 69.1 178 30-40 Volunteer WDW 2/2/73 66.1 139 20-30 Cadaver 2186** 2/7/73 70.5 124 70-80 Cadaver 2360 2/6,7/73 72.5 143 70-80 Mean 69.7 151 Standard Deviation 3.1 24 *An appropriate allowance for clothing has been subtracted. **The cadavers were embalmed.

(The percentile concept and the mathematical basis for percentile scaling are presented in the Appendix.) These distribution are com- pared to those for adult males of the 1962 HEW survey (4) in Fig. 1 . Since the test sample height and weight distributions of Fig. 1 were constructed as normal distributions, and the HEW distributions are of nearly the same shape, it is evident that the HEW data very nearly follow a normal distribution. HEW statistics indicate that the 50th percentile adult male weight and height are 164 lb (729 N)** and 68.3 in (1.735 * All of the sets of data in this report approximate straight lines when plotted on normal probability paper. This is a sufficient condition for the normal distribution assumption. **The 166 lb (738 N) HEW value has been reduced by 2 lb (9 N) to account for the "partially clothed" condition. A 3 lb (13 N) allowance was used for the fully clothed condition of the volunteers in this study. m); therefore, the mean of the sample used for this study was slightly lighter (13 lb (57 N)) and taller (1.4 in (0.035 m) than the HEW 50th percentile. Weight and height standard deviations of the HEW data are approximately 28 lb (125 N) and 2.9 in (0.074 m), as compared to 24 lb (107 N) and 3.1 in (0.079 m) for the subjects in this study. The correlation is considered to be adequate to allow the assumption that the test sample of this research was drawn from the same population as that of the HEW survey and therefore that the test results characterize the knees of United States adult males.

Patella length: superior-inferior (S-I) direction. 2. Patella width: lateral-medial (L-M) directions. 3. Tibia condyle width: L-M direction. 4. Femur condyle width: L-M direction. 5. Transverse profile of knee at midpatella height. 6. Sagittal profile of knee at midpatella width. The patella and condyle measurements are listed in Table 3. These are palpated dimensions, which means that the flesh was gently compressed during measurement, and that the compressed flesh thickness is included in the dimensions. The measurements were taken using a combination square with two heads as an anthropometer. The approximate points at which the measurements were taken (maximum dimensions) were determined by palpation, after which the instrument was applied and moved about until the maximum reading was obtained. Means and standard deviations were computed; with the normal distribution assumption in force, the dimen- sion versus percentile curves of Fig. 2 were developed using the tools presented in the Appendix. Palpated dimensions are admittedly of limited applicability to the dummy designer; however, the flesh thicknesses in- volved in these measurements are small and, assuming 0.2 in (5 mm) of each of the dimensions in Table 3 is due to com- pressed flesh, would likely not lead to significant errors. The smallest entry in Table 3 is 2.0 in (5 1 mm). If the 0.2 in (5 mm) flesh thickness assumption is in error by as much as 0. 1 in (2.5 mm), the error in the calculated skeletal dimension would still be less than 5.9%. Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the techniques used to record the transverse and sagittal knee profiles. The figures are nearly self-explanatory.

The contour data were traced di- rectly onto a sheet of paper from the gage. The profile data are presented in Tables 4 and 5, and the mean and ±1 stan- dard deviation data are plotted in Figs. 5 and 6. With the normal distribution assumption in force, these data were scaled to provide the percentile distributions of knee profiles illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8. The knee profile data are useful in describing the external shape of the anterior portion of the knee; however, the data give no indication of how the profile is located relative to the skeletal structure. This information is necessary if the dum- my knee is to have proper anthropometry. The problem has been partially solved using x-ray radiology. Fig. 9 was traced from radiograms of cadaver 2160.* It is evident that mid- height of the patella is at approximately the same elevation (proximal distance from the foot) as the femur axis. This indicates that the transverse knee profiles of Figs. 5 and 7 are the profiles observed when the knee is sectioned by a hor- izontal plane containing the femur axis (the leg being posi- tioned as in Figs. 3 and 4 for the profile measurements). Likewise, Fig. 9 indicates that the origin of the sagittal pro- files of Figs. 6 and 8 is below (inferior to) the femur axis by nominally one-quarter of the patella length (patella dimen- sions are given in Table 3 and Fig. 2).

The geometry described above holds only for the specific case where the tibia axis is oriented approximately 90 deg to the femur axis. FOAM QUALIFICATION TEST PROCEDURE The first step in conducting the knee test is to perform qualification tests on the crushable foam. There are two qualification tests- a crush test and a crush recovery test. As indicated earlier, it is not sufficient simply to purchase foam meeting the specifications of Table 1 and assume that the material properties are adequate. The crush properties vary sufficiently to necessitate qualification tests to assure that the material is comparable to that of the biomechanical tests reported herein.

The linear potentiometer was used a simple voltage divider in conjunction with a 1 .5 V battery to provide a voltage output linearly related to its shaft position. The femur force transducer, used in conjunc- tion with an Ellis BAM-1 bridge amplifier, provided a voltage directly proportional to compressive force. The displacement and force signals were used to drive a Hewlett Packard X-Y recorder that provided a continuous force-penetration curve. Foams were crushed at penetration rates of 0.1 1, 0.45, and 4.0 in/min (2.8, 1 1 .4, and 101 .6 mm/min) to evaluate rate sensitivity. All foams evaluated appeared to be rate insensi- tive in this range, and therefore a standard speed of 0.45 in/ min (1 14.3 mm/min) was adopted. The samples were crushed to a penetration of 2.75 in (70.0 mm) Fig. 12 illustrates a typical foam specimen sectioned after the test (this was not precisely the foam specified in Table 1 ; however, its mode of failure is representative).

The foam is to be placed be- tween rigid, parallel plates mounted in a universal testing machine such that, upon moving the plates together, main- taining parallelism, the entire specimen is crushed. The crush direction is parallel to the 4 in (101 .6 mm) thickness direc- tion, and it is required that this direction be parallel to the femur axis in the actual knee test.

The recovery (increase) in thickness from the 2 in dimension is to be monitored as a function of time. The recovery di- mension was monitored in a specific manner, as illustrated in Fig. 13.

A bar extending vertically upward from the cen- ter of the upper plate (which is centered with respect to the foam specimen) extends through a clearance hole in the cross- head and engages a dial indicator. The indicator was set to zero during the 1-5 min crushed hold time; subsequent read- ings, as a function of time after the load was released, con- stituted the crush recovery data used to generate the required performance specification. It was convenient, as illustrated in Fig. 13, to apply the load to the upper plate through a rig- id, hollow cylinder. This enabled the crosshead to be suffi- ciently far above the specimen at all times to afford conve- nient observation and measurement. The measurement scheme provides one recovery versus time curve for the en- tire specimen. If the recovery characteristics vary linearly over the specimen, the data will be representative of the av- erage characteristic. More complicated spatial variations of characteristics will lead to a less representative recovery ver- sus time curve. Ideally, there should be no spatial variation of the recovery characteristic; to a first-order approximation, this was true of the foam used in establishing required crush recovery performance specifications. KNEE LOADING The volunteer and cadaver knee loadings were performed as illustrated in Fig. 14. The force was applied by means of a hand-operated hydraulic jack. For the volunteer tests, the jack pump was located adjacent to the seat. This enabled the volunteer to apply the load manually at a comfortable rate and to a voluntary upper limit. The test subject was lapbelt restrained tightly in a lightly padded, rigid, upright seat at- tached to a bed plate. The hydraulic jack ram was horizontal and was clamped rigidly to an angle bracket extending up- ward from the bed plate. The foam block was 4 in (101.4 mm) thick, 6 in (152 mm) wide, and 8 in (203 MM) high. It was attached to rigid back- ing plate by means of double adhesive masking tape. The 6 x8in(152x 203 mm) size was sufficient to assure that the complete knee indent was recorded in the foam. Instrumen- tation used in the knee loading was identical to that previous- ly described for the foam crush qualification test. A 2.75 in (70 mm) stroke linear potentiometer was used to measure femur displacement relative to the foam, and a GSE femur force transducer was used to measure the compressive force. The foam backing plate was coupled through a flange to the force transducer, and the transducer was coupled to the pis-</page><page sequence="10">STATIC FORCE-PENETRATION RESPONSE 3789 Fig. 1 1 - Test configuration for foam crush characteristics evaluation Fig. 12 - Section through foam specimen after crush test Fig. 13 - Foam recovery qualification test configuration</page><page sequence="11">3790 DR. GERALD W. NYQUIST Fig. 14 - Knee test configuration for volunteer ton rod of the hydraulic jack ram. A tendency of the jack piston rod to rotate about its longitudinal axis during knee loading was noted in preliminary tests; therefore, a guided crosshead was added to preclude rotation. The linear poten- tiometer, used to measure femur displacement relative to the foam, was gimbal mounted to the foam backing plate and coupled to the thigh through a ball and socket joint and ad- justable attachment bracket. Bracket attachment to the thigh was facilitated by strapping a custom, wooden-splinted, nylon fabric support around the thigh and preloading it toward the pelvis with an elastic cord to eliminate the in- stability due to low shear rigidity of the compliant thigh flesh. The adjustable attachment bracket was coupled to one of the wooden splints. Its adjustment capability enabled the test to commence with the full 2.75 in (70 mm) potentiom- eter stroke available. The hydraulic jack ram was positioned vertically and lat- erally, such that its axis approximately intersected the ante- rior surface of the patella at midheight and midwidth when the femur and tibia axes were approximately horizontal and vertical, respectively. It was shown above that the femur and jack ram are approximately coaxial under these conditions. The lower leg is unrestrained in this test and is free to seek its own equilibrium position as the knee is loaded (some rear- ward movement of the foot occurs as the knee is loaded). The volunteers were instructed to retain the leg muscles in a relaxed state; however, one tends to tense involuntarily some- what at the higher knee forces. Knee indent volume versus peak force data were obtained by conducting the test incrementally. The load was released as each successive 0.5 in (13 mm) of femur displacement was reached. The foam block was replaced after each increment. Upon completion of the test, the indent volumes were mea- sured and plotted against the respective peak forces. A vol- ume was measured by filling the indent with #8 lead shot (approximately 0.090 in (2.3 mm) diameter spheres) and measuring the volume of the shot in a graduated cylinder. Volume determinations were not made until at least 1 h elapsed after unloading. Foam recovery takes place during this time and is nearly complete after 1 h. Volumes tabulat- ed herein are expressed in millilitres for convenience, since these units are commonly used on graduated cylinders. RESULTS The results of the foam material properties evaluation tests used to establish foam qualification requirements are sum- marized in Tables 6 and 7. All knee loading data were gen- erated using foam from three specific billets; accordingly, material properties evaluation tests utilized foam from these billets also. The foam crush properties data of Table 6 were scaled from the original continuous force versus crush records to facilitate statistical analyses (calculation of means and standard devia- tions). The mean and standard deviation data of the table are plotted in Fig. 15. The foam crush recovery data (means and standard deviations) of Table 7 are plotted in Fig. 16. The results of the knee loading tests are summarized in Ta- bles 8 and 9. As in the case of the material properties evalua- tion tests, the continuous force versus femur displacement records were scaled to provide the tabulated data, which were, in turn, used to calculate means and standard deviations. The mean and standard deviation data of Table 8 are plotted in Fig. 17. The knee force versus indent volume data of Table 9 are plotted in Fig. 18.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS Performance requirements for the foam crush characteristics and for the knee response, when tested with a qualified foam, have been developed from the data presented above. The per- formance requirements are specified in the form of recom- mended response corridors. The response is within the per- formance requirement if it lies within the corridor. The corridors are basically idealizations of the mean ± 1 standard deviation responses of the results. Each corridor is defined by a series of coordinate points connected by straight- line segments to assure that it will be accurately reproduced by future users. Since the corridor boundaries are symmetric with respect to the mean response data (mean ± 1 standard deviation), a best fit to the mean data is the center of the cor- ridor.</page><page sequence="13">3792 DR.

The corri- dor width was narrowed somewhat from the ± 1 standard deviation of Fig. 17 to place a more stringent requirement on allowable variations in response.* The force versus in- dent volume corridor was generated from the biomechanical data points of Table 9 by linearly interpolating to provide indent volumes at even 100 lb (445 N) increments, after which volume averages and standard deviations were com- puted. *This performance specification was adopted by General Motors while developing a 50th percentile dummy for NHTSA (5).</page><page sequence="14">STATIC FORCE-PENETRATION RESPONSE 3793 Table 9 - Summary of Knee Force-Indent Volume Data Force, lb Volume, cm3 Force, lb Volume, cm3 Force, lb Volume, cm3 Force, lb Volume, cm3 CJM, R CJM, L GWN, R GWN, L 140 15 160 15 125 11 140 15 280 56 290 62 210 45 280 51 510 156 450 161 300 96 430 113 590 223 580 239 390 152 530 189 460 215 570 288 LMP, R LMP, L GP, R GP, L 100 9 120 10 60 5 95 12 280 35 300 36 145 24 210 29 360 103 440 109 285 60 280 56 505 188 510 162 600 352 640 353 KRT, R KRT, L WDW, R WDW, L 95 6 110 8 60 8 100 8 195 27 290 35 125 14 240 33 310 88 390 98 180 42 360 88 380 131 310 95 362 134 2186, R 2186, L 2360, R 2360, L 160 13 280 32 170 12 130 24 350 82 420 100 280 45 325 88 460 198 480 176 375 99 525 178 495 296 600 279 450 216 570 279 630 439 750 417 455 228 630 285 650 475 560 403 790 418 3114 _ / (700) _ ß 2669 _ ET β (60°) / / g J- 2224 _ / / β S (500) _ Ρ / rC^ ' 1779 ~ μ / / υ (400) ~ / / ß S 1334 _ / / / ο.

Since the corridors are basically representative of ± 1 stan- dard deviation from the mean response of the population (except for the ±3/4 standard deviation knee force-penetra- tion corridor), and ± 1 standard deviation includes 68% of the area under the normal distribution curve, it is apparent, assuming normal distribution theory is applicable, that the corridors are representative of a response percentile range of approximately 16 (50 - 68/2) to 84 (50 + 68/2).

Conversely, a foam crush property lying below the center of the qualification corridor would cause the test results of a 23rd percentile response knee to fall below the lower (23rd percentile) boundary of the corridor. Similar errors would be incurred with respect to the force versus indent volume corridor. This hypothetical example makes it clear that, be- cause variations in foam crush characteristics are allowed, the observed variation in knee responses are increased. At this point, one can be assured that the response of a dummy knee structure is truly 50th percentile only if the foam properties lead to midcorridor responses in the foam qualification tests and the results of the knee loading test lie along the centers of the suggested corridors. Some in- sights into more exacting requirements are discussed in the following section of the paper.

It was illustrated, assuming normal distribution theory, that corridor boundaries approximating mean ± 1 standard deviation responses constitute an envelope for ap- proximately 16th through 84th percentile response. One of the deficiencies of the suggested performance requirements, therefore, is that they may not be sufficiently exacting. The following analyses provide some insights into the percentile scaling problem and suggest some more exacting requirements for knee anthropometry and performance. Percentile scaling of the knee anthropometric data is dis- cussed first, followed by a treatment of percentile scaling of the knee response data. A complicating factor in analyz- ing knee response is that the statistical spread or scatter in the data is due to two mechanisms- anthropometric varia- tions and foam material properties variations. A knee re- sponse model is developed to isolate the response variations due to anthropometry alone and is utilized in conjunction with the experimental data to establish recommended per- centile scaling rules for knee performance. A basic assumption in force in all of the following statis- tical analyses is that the data are normally distributed (it was noted earlier in the paper that this assumption is justified by the fact that the data approximate straight lines when plotted on normal probability paper). Normal distribution theory is therefore applicable. The Appendix gives a brief discus- sion of normal distribution theory, presenting pertinent in- formation for understanding the analyses that follow. PERCENTILE SCALING OF KNEE ANTHROPOMETRY - The knee transverse and sagittal profile anthropometric data of Tables 4 and 5 and Figs. 5 and 6 were scaled to provide the percentile distribution profiles of Figs. 7 and 8. Means and standard deviations of the tables were computed in ac- cordance with Eqs. A-5 and A-6 of the Appendix, and stan- dard deviations were used to compute moduli from Eq. A-7. Turning to Fig. A-3, the r?x values for the percentiles of in- terest were scaled from the curve (0.48 for 25th and 75th percentile; 1.17 for 5th and 95th percentile). Dividing these r?x values by the previously computed values of η produced the deviations (x) from the mean (X) associated with the per- centiles. The results were obtained by adding χ to X for per- centiles greater than 50 and subtracting χ from X percentiles smaller than 50 in accordance with Eq. A-4. The data points of Figs. 7 and 8 comprise these results. Similar calculations were made to scale the test subject height and weight data of Table 2 and Fig. 1 and the palpated knee dimensions of Table 3 and Fig. 2. PERCENTILE SCALING OF KNEE LOADING DATA - The experimental knee force-penetration data of Table 8 and Fig. 17 were percentile scaled in the same manner as the knee profile anthropometric data. The results are presented in Fig. 23. Unfortunately, these scaled data contain the same inac- curacies as the data of Fig. 17, due to foam crush properties variations as discussed above. The spread in response as a function of percentile in Fig. 23 is magnified somewhat due to the spread in foam crush strength properties.

Insights are gained that enable at least an approximate separation of the spread in response due to anthropometric variations from spread due to variation in foam crush properties. This allows more ex- acting percentile scaling of the knee force-penetration data. The more exacting result may be utilized if foam properties approximate the center of the crush qualification corridor of Fig. 19. KNEE RESPONSE MODEL - Some basic assumptions in force in this development are as follows: 1 . A knee with nth percentile anthropometry (size) has nth percentile response; 0 &lt; η &lt; 100. 2. The foam crush characteristics may be simplified by lumping shear and compression crush strengths into an equiv- alent crush pressure, a function of crush depth. 3. The knee anthropometry may be modeled as a parabola of revolution, were the parabola fits the data of Table 4 and Fig. 7. In addition, it may be assumed that the force generated is a function of three parameters: 1. Depth of knee penetration into the foam. 2. Knee anthropometry (geometry). 3. Foam crush properties. With some approximation, variables can be assigned to define these quantities analytically. The mean foam crush characteristic of Fig. 19 may be ap- proximated by two straight lines indicated in Fig. 24.

The anthropometry of the knee may be approximated by assuming a surface of revolution generated by rotating the knee transverse profile of Fig. 5 about the proximal axis. The profile of Fig. 5 is nearly parabolic and is closely approximat- ed by the relation z = ky2 (5) where k = 0.417 in"' (16.42 m"' ) to fit the mean data. The correlation is illustrated in Fig. 25. With Eq. 4 defining the crush force per unit area ρ as a function of foam penetration δ and Eq. 5 defining the knee geometry, one can integrate ρ(δ) over the knee surface to define the knee crush force F as a function of penetration X. The geometry is illustrated in Fig. 26. The integral takes the form F(X) = J P(ô)dA (6) A where δ = X - z, and dA is the projected increment of area on a plane perpendicular to the z-axis.

A comparison of the knee response predicted by Eq. 10 with the mean biomechanical data is presented in Fig. 27.

The pre- dicted force is a bit low, but the slope approximates the ex- perimental data well. The result is considered to be suffi- ciently valid to allow continuation of the analysis.

Although the mathematics are valid for all X &gt;0.065 in (1.65 mm), in a physical sense, X must be re- strained to a maximum value of approximately 1.2 in (30.5 mm), after which the parabolic knee anthropometry assump- tion is not valid. Eq. 19 gives the standard deviation of knee force associated with anthropometric variations alone. It could be used to generate numerical results to compare with the experimental data of Table 8 and Fig. 17 to evaluate the effect that varia- tion in foam crush properties had in increasing the spread of the experimental data. As indicated earlier, however, the penetration X must be limited to approximately 1.2 in (30.5 mm). It is opted, instead to compute coefficients of varia- tion* for the model and for the experimental data in the range of 0.065 in &lt; X &lt; 1 .2 in (1 .65 mm &lt; X &lt; 30.5 mm) where the model is applicable. The average value of the ratio of model coefficient to experimental coefficient, in the lim- ited range of applicability of the model, is then assumed to be valid for all values of penetration X. Assuming the model coefficient is the proper value to associate with anthropomet- ric variations alone, the experimental standard deviations can be modified to adjust the experimental coefficients to this proper value. The resulting spread in the experimental data is then defined to be representative of anthropometric varia- tions alone. The coefficient of variation Cy for the model may be ob- tained from Eqs. 9 and 18 as follows: SF(X) °ν~ F(X) ■ir ( 2 PŪ ' I (M?X2 2 + 2PnX- ° J Sv 2Ak2 V + 2PnX- ° M1-M2/|k Sv * / 1 2 P0 ' 1 M?X2 2 2 + 2PnX 0 J 2Ak ' 2 0 Mj U2J = - (20) k The two parameters of Eq. 20 were previously evaluated as = 0.155 in"* (6.10 mm"*) and k = 0.417 in"* (16.42 mm'*); therefore, Cv = 0.155/0.417 = 0.372 = 37.2% The average value of Cy for the experimental data of Table 8, for X = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 in (6.35, 12.7, 19.1, and 25.4 mm), is 42.5%. The analysis has shown, therefore, that the spread in the experimental data is too large by a factor of 42.5/37.2 or 1.142. Thus, each of the standard deviations of Table 8 must be multiplied by a correction factor of 1/1.142 or 0.875 to eliminate the effect of variation in foam crush properties.

This completes the percentile scaling analysis. It should be noted that the force versus indent volume data of Table 9 and Fig. 18 reflect an increased spread due to variation of foam crush and recovery properties. Similar modeling tech- niques could probably be pursued to resolve this problem. CONCLUSIONS Conclusions reached in connection with this research pro- gram are as follows: 1. Crushable materials with well-defined, reproducible crush strength properties are difficult to obtain. The qual- ification tests defined herein are necessary to assure that a foam responds in a manner similar to that used in the orig- - inai biomechanical experiments and therefore that the knee test data may be compared to biomechanical requirements. 2. Lower leg position was a poorly controlled variable in this experiment. The lower leg was not affixed. It flexed relative to the knee somewhat during the test. This proba- bly added some variability to the data. 3. There is a significant variation of knee response with percentile rating. 4. The force-penetration corridor of Fig. 21 and the force- indent volume corridor of Fig. 22 are reasonable conditions to require for biomechanical fidelity of 50th percentile dum- my knee response (necessary, but not sufficient). 5. A more exacting condition to require for biomechanical fidelity of an adult male dummy knee is provided by the fam- ily of responses of Fig. 29.

The quasi-static knee response corridors suggested should be adopted as guidelines for 50th percentile adult male an- thropometric dummy knee design. 2. The percentile distribution of response presented in Fig. 29 should be used as a guide for evaluating the acceptability of adult male knees of percentile other than 50th. This in- formation also should be utilized to make a more discriminat- ing analysis of item 1 above, especially when dummies are designed to meet specific response percentiles. 3. Currently available dummy knees should be evaluated in accordance with the procedures presented herein to estab- lish the acceptability of their responses with respect to the recommended performance requirements. It is recommended that the dummy knee joint resistance be adjusted to the cur- rently accepted 1 g setting for this test. 4. The knee anthropometric data presented herein should be used as a guide in developing knees meeting the recom- mended performance requirements. 5. The meaning of the term percentile as applied to an- thropometric dummy design should be reviewed. To date, the term has been utilized solely in connection with anthro-</page><page sequence="22">STATIC FORCE-PENETRATION RESPONSE 3801 pometry. This paper introduced response percentile. As more exacting biomechanical data become available to de- fine humanlike performance, there will probably be addi- tional response percentile requirements suggested. It is recommended that future dummies be developed to reflect one specific percentile rating in both anthropometry and response, unless it is shown that this philosophy implies ba- sic incompatibilities. 6. Future biomechanical research efforts in connection with knee response should be directed toward a dynamic study of the structure.

APPENDIX - Normal Distribution Theory A simple treatment of the normal or Gaussian distribution is given by Schenck (6). It can be shown that, for a normal distribution, the frequency of occurrence y of any deviation χ of a quantity X from the mean value μ is given by the equation y = yoe_7?2x2 (A1) where: i? = constant: modulus or index of precision y0 = occurrence frequency at zero deviation Holding η and y0 constant and plotting y versus χ gives the familiar bell-shaped curve (Fig. A-l). This is an indication of the behavior of the parent population from .which one ob- tains finite samples in experimental work. It can be shown that the area A under the curve of Fig. A-l is λ/Γ A=- y0 (A-2) V y Y° 7Λ / ' J- 2 / ' -η J- χ / ' y=Yoe ^ / ' ° α&gt; / ' U 0) α&gt; ι- / / / I ' ' ' 0) ι- / ' D V. / c ' 3 / O ' / / / I % O ' ' ' L- O / % ' χ + X Deviation (x) Fig. A-l - Normal distribution It is convenient to normalize the curve by requiring the area to take the value of unity; therefore, Eq. A-2 requires V y0 = - VF</page><page sequence="23">3802 DR. GERALD W. NYQUIST and the normalized version of Eq. A-l is y=JLe-r?2x2 (A-3) y/τΓ The total area under the normalized curve (unity) is repre- sentative of all deviations of the population, and the proba- bility ρ of a deviation from the mean falling between plus and minus χ is equal to the area under the curve bounded by plus and minus x. This probability (area) can be evaluated by the calculus. The term percentile (P) is used in statistics to indicate the probability that the variable studied (X) will be less than or equal to a given value. Graphically, in terms of the normal- ized distribution of Eq. A-3, the percentile level is equal to the fraction of the total area under the bell curve, to the left of the given value X, expressed as a percent. This concept is illustrated in Fig. A-2. Every value of X has an associated percentile level. Assume for the moment that the mean value of a variable being studied has been established, and that the normal dis- tribution has been defined (that is, the modulus η has been evaluated). Then it is apparent from Fig. A-2 that the per- centile Ρ of a given value of the variable X may be established as follows: P(X) = Ρ(μ - χ) = 50 - 1/2 p(x), X &lt; μ (A-4) P(X) = Ρ(μ + χ) = 50 + 1/2 p(x), X &gt; μ where p(x) is the probability, expressed as a percent, of X falling in the range μ-χ&lt;Χ&lt;μ + χ. Since p(x) can be deter- mined as a function of ηχ , Eq. A-4 may be used to tabulate percentile Ρ as a function of ηχ for use with any normal dis- tribution. This information is plotted in Fig. A-3. One piece of groundwork remains to be laid. It was assumed in the foregoing that the mean value μ and the modulus η were known; therefore, methods to evaluate these parameters are necessary, if the theory is to be applied to the experi- mental knee data (sample from the parent population of United States adult male knee responses). The best estimate of the mean value μ of the population is the mean or average value X of the sample, that is, Ν χ-νΣχ' (α·5) i=l where there are Ν specimens X¡ in the sample. The modulus η may be computed from the quantity known as the standard deviation. The standard deviation σ of the population is de- fined by the expression ö=lim 1/2 Ν-*50 w L i= ι -J This may be approximated by computing the standard de- viation S of the test sample using the relation Ν 1 - 9 1/2 s- &lt;Α·6&gt; i= 1 which is a truncation of the series for a, except that 1/N - 1 has been substituted for 1/N. This substitution leads to in- creased accuracy for S when X is computed using Eq. A-5. It can be shown that the probability of X falling within μ ± σ (approximated by X ± S) is 68.2%. In addition, it can be shown that ησ = λ/2/2, which, for the finite sample, may be approximated by vr r?S = - (A-7) 2 y ^^Area=Probability p(&gt;) ^ Area-Percenti le P(X). «ν Μ χ ». χ χ -« Mean μ *- Fig. A-2 - Illustration of probability and percentile</page><page sequence="24">STATIC FORCE-PENETRATION RESPONSE 3803 Thus, one can approximate μ by X using Eq. A-5, approximate σ by S using Eq. A-6, and evaluate η using Eq. A-7. These data, along with the plot of Fig. A-3, are sufficient to pursue the percentile scaling problem. For the tables and graphs presented in the paper, the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentile results are presented. The theory enables results to be computed for any desired percentile. 50 ^ Mean 40 ' ! 60 ' ' ' 0.48 a ' » 30 - χ £ » 70 - ' % X * 25% &amp; 75% ! 20.
