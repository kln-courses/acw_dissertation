<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEPH LOPREATO PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY There is a rich literature on Vilfredo Pareto's sociology, although it falls decidedly short of what could have been predicted 40 odd years ago, when the influential Talcott Parsons (1937) proposed Pareto, Durk- heim, and Weber as the threefold basis of modern theoretical sociology. Moreover, Pareto's major book, A Treatise on General Sociology, other- wise known as The Mind and Society (1916) in the English-speaking world, is extremely high on the list of controversial works. The causes are multiple and complex both for the unrealized promise of the contribution and for the controversies that surround it. There is, of course, the hoax of ideological conservatism perpetrated in the face of a political skepticism so intense that it inspired or influenced such classics as Brave New World and Animal Farm - a hoax that curiously engenders no blushes even when Pareto (1916 : 2057) 1 declares revolutions to be manifestations of corruption and incompetence in the governing class coupled with "elements of superior quality" rising in the governed class. Dispensing with saving graces, however exiguous, Parsons (1968 : 415) suggests instead the hypothesis of "the scientific limitations of subsequent generations of sociologists." It is a daring and fascinating sentence, especially for one who did his share to obfuscate and conceal Pareto. There is probably some truth to it, in one sense: certainly there is not much disagreement that sociology has little of a systematic nature to show for the last half century beyond a few methodological accomplish- ments marred by conceptual logomachies that even a kind soul like Epictetus might have adjudged fickle disputes. In another sense, I have less doubt about the validity of Parsons' pronouncement. It is a curious thing about that old saying on forgetting our founders. We seem unable to either forget them or remember them. Our, "fathers," some anyway, are invoked at every turn. Yet, their argu- ments - whether on capitalism, religion, revolution, system analysis, and so forth - are as mysterious today as they were 50 years ago. Doubtless, they are in part to blame. But one also has the impression sometimes that we have moved blinfolded through our first major frontier. i References to the Treatise will be to the 1963 Dover publication. The figures after the year of publication refer, as per convention, to numbered sections. Hereafter, for convenience sake, references to the Treatise will be shown without the publication year.</page><page sequence="2">134 J. LOPREATO The fundamental problem is this: the great minds who wrote in the nineteenth century and soon thereafter had been bred to be keen about a major transformation in the evolution of human society and the con- comitant rise of an intellectual culture that viewed history, "natural" as well as cultural, in large sweeps of time, and knowledge as a symphonic product of complementary approaches to such a history. Although they had to battle the idiocies of Social Darwinism, they were all evolutionists. Karl Marx may have erred in drawing excessive theoretical capital from the conditions of industrializing society, but he was after all engaged in the quest for the laws of social and economic development in human society in general. The case of Emile Durkheim is almost superfluous to mention: he zeroed in on the ancient hunting and gathering society and sought to grasp the forces and the effects of its transformation. Max Weber was less ambitious than either, but he, too, focused on the development of one fundamental institution in view of its connection to the mutations of another. The sociology that has followed on their heels has been a sociology attuned to the "social problems" received and spawned by a particular society in the making. Sociology has become to a large extent the science of United States society. This is the fundamental problem. Of course, scientific developments, like other events, follow an undulating line, with the result that a crest is very much the conclusion of a previous trough. So, the last 50 years will turn out to have been anything but lost. But we have been breathing softly. Above all, in our eagerness to grasp the here-and-now, we have lost sight of the large picture and focused far too closely on the little one. Most of the literature on Pareto's work, for example, is fixated on the meaning of "elites," their behavior as a governing class (which for Pareto they were not - not necessarily), the use or misuse of force by one class or another, and the like. An occasional glance into his sociology of knowledge has felicitously broadened the picture. Then, of course, there has been the frequent, but mostly cursory, expedition into that peculiar Paretean concept, the "residue"; and the inevitable question has risen as to whether or not it refers to that most awful, or maligned term, the "instinct." In so stating the case, I am aware of the possibility that it may seem ridiculous, and I am prepared to accept the fact that ridiculous cases are presented by ridiculous advocates. If, nevertheless, I have succeeded in conveying the sense that Pareto's sociology still remains to be mined, I have accomplished my first goal. The Evolutionist Muddle of Pareto's Time My chief goal is to present Pareto as an evolutionist: more specifically to interpret and discuss his contribution to what may well be considered today's major quest of the evolutionary behavioral science of Homo sapiens. I shall call it the theory of the human "biogram" (Count, 1958).</page><page sequence="3">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 135 Before confronting this task, however, a few comments of another sort will help to explain the fact that, with few and partial exceptions, we have misread and mistated Pareto's sociological case. This is the aim of the present section. Pareto had a horrible habit : although he was a voracious reader, and obviously had a highly retentive mind, rarely and only in miniscule doses did he acknowledge even the sources of inspiration for his ideas. As if this fault (shared by most great minds, of course) were not enough, he specialized in the art of debunking. The Pareto specialist knows, for instance, that already as a young student he had been an active member of a group of Darwinian enthusiasts at the University of Turin, then the most active Italian center for the diffusion of Darwinian theories. And anyone who will read carefully both Darwin and Pareto cannot but be struck by the kindredness of spirit between the two scholars insofar as a theory of the behavioral predispositions of human beings is concerned (especially Darwin, 1871, 1873; Pareto, 1916, Vol. II). The Treatise, moreover, shows that Pareto had a fair knowledge of studies of animal behavior, and even that he himself was an astute observer of animal behavior. It is no accident at all then that some of the great contempo- rary sociologists of the United States of America (e.g., Talcott Parsons, George C. Homans, and Robert K. Merton) were introduced to, and taught, Vilfredo Pareto's work by the physiologist Lawrence J. Hen- derson, who had, in turn, been introduced to Pareto by the great ento- mologist W. Morton Wheeler. Yet, Pareto's numerous references or allusions to Darwinian science (and non-science) are most frequently of a critical, debunking nature. This fact has combined with his use of a system analysis (until recently considered the antithesis of evolutionist analysis) to mislead scholars into thinking that Pareto's work was non-evolutionist, if not altogether anti- evolutionist. To a large extent, however, Pareto's critical stance toward Darwinian theory and subsequent ideology is justifiable. The central principle in Darwin's theory is, of course, "natural selection." As is often reported, this idee maitre crossed Darwin's mind while reading Malthus' essay on population. The species have a tendency to overreproduce. (Indeed, they have to, if they are to survive and still serve as food to one another.) Yet their respective populations tend to remain remarkably stable in time. The question arises: which individuals of a given species have the best chance to survive? So posed, the issue immediately directs attention to the fact that, as Ernst Mayr (1979) points out, Darwin conceived of selection as a two- step process. The first step helps to answer the question raised just above. It refers to the production of variation. Every generation, Darwin noted, generates an enormous amount of variation. Thus, individuals that have the best chance to survive are those who have the most appro- priate combinations of traits or features: e.g., a healthy constitution and in general the ability to cope with the environment, enemies, and com- petitors. They would reproduce and transmit, through their offspring,</page><page sequence="4">136 J. LOPREATO their traits to future generations. This was the second step in the process of selection. Darwin, however, was not always so direct about the principle of natural selection. Above all, he was hooked on the treacherous metaphor, "the struggle for existence." Worse still, the great master made the mistake of adopting Herbert Spencer's concept of "the survival of the fittest" as a "more accurate" expression than natural selection, and in the fifth edition of his 1859 volume he even changed the title of the chapter to read "Natural Selection; or the Survival of the Fittest." The root of the problem was Darwin's uncertainty about the source of the variation that supplies the raw material for natural selection. He never knew Mendel's 1865 discovery of the factors transmitting hereditary inform- ation, namely the genetic units conveyed by each parent to the offspring. Indeed, Mendel's work was not rediscovered until 1900. But whatever the reason for Darwin's difficulty, the switch to the Spencerian "survival of the fittest" was disastrous, for this was the battle cry of what came to be known as "social Darwinists." Some of these were just confused; others were respectable scholars whom history might have better dealt with under a different label; most were plain fools who found an outlet for their vainglorious minds in an equation between biological fitness and affluence, high socio-economic position, and poli- tical might. They were apologists of the worst form of capitalism, racism, and jingoism. The Marquis Pareto, to the manor born, saw their chatter for what it was, pure ideology; and in the Treatise he never ceases to heap scorn on it. The aversion to social Darwinism at times also carries over, perhaps unjustly, to Darwin himself, who is upbraided, among other things, for using an absolute, progress-like concept of adaptation. The Theory of the Human Biogram The heart of Pareto's sociology is what is known as "the theory of residues," or "sentiments." It is knotty. As Norberto Bobbio (1973 : 21), social philosopher and sagacious scholar of Pareto's sociology, has stated with undeniable justification, no critic "has been able to say a clear word" about it. My contention in this essay is that until recently it was not possible to fully understand it. The reason is that the theory is in large part an attempt to construct what in modern behavioral science has come to be known as the human "biogram," namely a set of bio- logical forces that interact with environmental and socio-cultural forces to produce certain classes of behavior. Despite variations in time and place in their details, these nevertheless reveal certain underlying cons- tancies or rules that suggest: (a) a high degree of sociocultural unity in the human species, (b) a strong link between present behavior and the behavior of time long gone by, and (c) an intimate relationship between biology and culture.</page><page sequence="5">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 137 The emergence of the biogram as a central problem of evolutionary science is an inevitable by-product of "the new synthesis": the marriage of genetic science and Darwinian theory. Genetics has provided the theoretical thrust to go beyond the old morphological and taxonomic studies into the frontier of behavior as a fact of evolutionary significance. We are mostly at the level of hypotheses, and some of these are extremely daring. That, perhaps, is the main source of resistance on the part of social scientists. On the other hand, noone can reasonably accuse the history of daring hypotheses with the epithet of sterility. It is necessary to note that Pareto's theory of the biogram had its beginnings in the late 1890s, and was for all practical purposes completed by 1908, when talk of genetics was still quite sparse. In fact, the Treatise gives no clue as to whether Pareto had any knowledge of this emerging science. To the extent that the theory of sentiments is to be approached from a new synthesis perspective - as a theory of Homo's biogram - it must be stated at the outset that it suffers from the same vagueness (and more) that characterizes Darwin's theory of evolution. Just the same, Pareto may have possessed a deeper intuitive grasp of the deve- loping expeditions into human behavior from a modern evolutionary standpoint. In any case, Pareto was more attuned to the inroads into "human nature" previously made by such scholars as Hume and Vico. Above all, he took the same painstaking steps into the world of com- parative human behavior that Darwin had taken into the comparative realm of diversification and speciation. The theory of the human biogram is part of the growing awareness that the interior of "the black box " is simply not a tabula rasa (Dobz- hansky, 1962; Alexander, 1971). The theory has a major enemy that is deep-rooted in the history of social thought: it is the rationalistic bias, and may be depicted very simply as follows: B-* C, in which a belief, B, is taken as the cause of a given conduct, C. That type of mistake is sometimes committed when we say, for instance, that we obey our superiors because we believe in the legitimacy of their positions. Research on other species is replete with examples of animals who know only too well which individuals to defer to, and yet we do not resort to rational motives to explain such behavior. Thus, in attributing causality, some- times exclusive, to human belief we often commit an act of anthropo- centrism that unnecessarily restricts the scope of our knowledge. Often, not always, there is no direct connection between belief, B, and conduct, C. Belief and conduct both are determined by a third factor, A. The latter represents a behavioral force that may be said to have been selected during the evolutionary history of the species. This is the source of what is termed "non-logical" conduct. There are times, too, when the force, A, gives rise to the conduct, C, and this, in turn, produces the belief, B. Finally, there is the possibility that the conduct, C, is the result of the belief, B, which, in turn, is generated by the force, A, (267-9). In all cases the search for A widens the scope of the analysis, renders it more historical in the broad sense of the word, and, as we shall see, facilitates a parsimonious classification and explanation of human conduct without sacrificing weighty information. Pareto identifies forty-odd major types</page><page sequence="6">138 J. LOPREATO of the force, A, and he terms them "sentiments" or "residues." We shall deal with some of them in due course. Methods of Isolating the Sentiments Wilson (1975 : 550-1) has proposed that, in the absence of an anthro- pological genetics, there appear to be two indirect methods open to us: (1) the intense examination of human behavior with a view to singling out uniformities in its repertoire, and (2) a comparison of other species, especially the higher primates, with Homo sapiens in an effort to see which traits are shared across related species and which are strictly intra-specific. Remarkably, Pareto followed both these methods. He further combined the two with an ingenious linguistic analysis suggested by the presence in Homo sapiens of a trait that he (972-75) termed the "hunger for logical developments." Humans not only perform certain acts; they also have a pronounced tendency to explain those acts. While these popular "theories" usually constitute faulty explanations, which unfortunately tend to be taken at face value by social scientists - and hence lead to sociological errors - they also give powerful clues to underlying forces of human behavior: the sentiments. Current in any given group of people are a number of propositions, descriptive, preceptive, or otherwise. For example: ..."Love thy neighbour as thyself." "Learn to save if you would not one day be in need." Such propositions, combined by logical or pseudological nexuses and amplified with factual narrations of various sorts, constitute theories, theologies, cosmogonies, systems of metaphysics, and so on... all such propositions and theories are experimental facts, and... we are here obliged to consider and examine them... for the image of social activity is stamped on the majority of such propositions and theories, and often it is through them alone that we manage to gain some knowledge of the forces which are at work in society - that is, of the tendencies and inclinations of human beings (7-8 - emphasis provided). Let us give an example. Suppose we focus on the Latin maxim, Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori - it is sweet and decorous to die for one's homeland. This saying may be divided into two parts: one cons- titutes a principle, a moral injunction, to die for the homeland; the other purports to be an explanation of the act itself. If we abstract the expla- natory part ("it is sweet and decorous"), we are left with a part - the residual - that, as moral and ethnographic history shows, appears to be general to all peoples at all known times. That is, the residual (" to die for the homeland") constitutes a constancy, a uniformity, in time and space (not a constant in the mathematical sense). We conclude thereby that general throughout human society is a moral rule requiring that under some circumstances individuals sacrifice their lives for their groups. Pareto terms this the "residue" (literally, what is left when the explanation has been abstracted). We can now introduce two other sets of facts. First, human beings at all times and places have in fact sacrificed their lives for their group.</page><page sequence="7">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 139 Wars and the volunteers who join the battle are proof positive of the fact, although it is equally true that the moral rule is not obeyed equally by all. Second, if we chance to glance at the rest of the animal kingdom, we discover that other social animals feature a similar tendency (see, e.g., Wilson, 1975; Dawkins, 1976). The universality of the moral in- junction to sacrifice self for the group, coupled with the universal fact of actual acts of self-sacrifice, led Pareto to hypothesize the presence in the biology of our species of a "sentiment," an "instinct" which he, eager to avoid anthropomorphism, termed "risking one's life" (1148). The logic of this procedure, we might add, has been found useful in more than one discipline. Chomsky (1972), for example, has found cogent evidence for the argument that the similarities in language acquisition across cultures, and shared "deep structures" of grammar in different languages, point to an innate human language capacity that is more directive than was once believed. Residues and Sentiments Several clarifications are now necessary. We have been using the terms "residue," "sentiment," and just above even "instinct" interchan- geably. Technically, however, what Pareto classifies and discusses are the residues, not the sentiments or instincts. The reason is that the residues and not the sentiments are observable. The possible action of the sentiment, and therefore its theoretical relevance, is inferred from the constancy in time and place of the nucleus termed residue that is inter- preted to be its cultural manifestation. Residues are "the manifestations of sentiments... just as the rising of mercury in a thermometer is a mani- festation of the rise in temperature" (875). The distinction loomed large in a scholar whose basic training was after all in the mathematical sciences. Pareto, therefore, felt compelled to give a certain preeminence of exposition to the residues despite the fact that his interest was clearly in the sentiments as forces ultimately behind residues and other cultural facts. Indeed, so keen is the underlying focus on the sentiments that in innumerable places "residue" and "sentiment" are used quite inter- changably. (The same license shall be taken in the present essay). Likewise, the term residue is used as being inclusive of the underlying sentiment (1690). The point must be emphasized, moreover, that the sentiments are viewed as "inherited" behavioral traits (1845, passim). It is in part for this reason, of course, that I have spoken of Pareto's theory as a theory of the human biogram. Sentiments: Instinct versus Learning A few words about "instinct" may also be useful. Among most social scientists this term continues to evoke revulsion, and we tend to exorcise it with the concept of "learning." In biology, by contrast, "instinct" has been gaining respectability. Moreover, while modern literature bes-</page><page sequence="8">140 J. LOPREATO tows a certain flexibility of interpretation on the term (see, for example, Dobzhansky, 1962; Schneirla, 1972; Richards, 1974), two distinct meanings seem to be emerging (Wilson, 1975). One merely sensitizes us to the presence of a genetic component in behavior without prejudging the size or permissiveness of such component. The other emphasizes the idea of an unlearned behavior disposition that is not susceptible to modification through experience. The latter is the sense in which most social scientists understand instinct. Pareto rejected this second meaning, and so do modern biologists. Speaking in genetic terms for sociobiologists, Barash (1977: 41) has remarked that "behavior is not contained somehow within a gene, waiting to leap out like Athena, fully armored, from the head of Zeus. Rather, genes are blueprints, codes for a range of potential phenotypes." Like- wise, for Pareto, sentiments or instincts do not serve as exact templates for specific topographies of behavior (828). Sentiments, in short, do not manifest themselves as particular behaviors. Rather, they are guides or predispositions towards certain kinds or classes of responses to the environment. Such responses may, therefore, be viewed as acknowledge- ments that in the course of evolutionary history directed behavior has been more frequently adaptive than random behavior. Sentiments may, thus, be thought of as a priori hypotheses that make useful bets about the relative appropriateness and efficiency of behavioral responses to environmental conditions. Instinct and learning are not mutually exclusive categories. Learning is not independent from instinct. Human beings, for example, cannot be expected to learn to lay eggs and then fan them diligently until they hatch. The point is that we have evolved to learn certain behaviors more easily than others, and still other behaviors not at all. Likewise, we behave culturally because we have been selected to behave in that fashion. The capacity for learning is itself a biological fact. The reason seems to be simple enough: organisms that are adept at deriving lessons from their environment have a better chance of survival than those who are not. And those organisms which can draw inferences, predict, and simulate may be better off than those that learn only on the basis of simple trial-and-error. A capacity for learning, therefore, is part of the logic of evolution. And it most assuredly is not unique to humans, although we do excel in the art. Research on white-crowned sparrows, for example, shows that in addition to the species-specific skeleton of the song, these birds are capable of learning many regional dialects. In fact, even the skeleton requires some elements of learning (Marler and Tamura, 1964; Konishi, 1965; for a brief discussion see, Wilson, 1975: 156-7; for a bibliographic glimp.se, see Thorpe, 1956, 1974). Current research on chimpanzees is even demolishing the ancient prejudice that only humans have " true language " (see, for example, Premack, 1970; Gardner and Gardner, 1971). Thorpe (1974 : 301) summarizes research on animal languages by noting that, "although no animal appears to have a language which is propo- sitional, fully syntactic, and at the same time clearly expressive of</page><page sequence="9">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 141 intention, all these features can be found separately (to at least some degree) in the animal kingdom." The reason for the built-in capacity for learning may be specified further (Dawkins, 1976 : Chap. 4). Genes, which we assume to be in some way related to sentiments, do not, strictly speaking, control behavior. They control protein synthesis. Ultimately, this is a powerful way of manipulating behavior, but it is an awfully slow technique. It cannot cope directly with the fact that successful behavior often requires res- ponses to events that take place in split-second periods. There is nothing in human genetics, for example, that counsels us explicitly against people pointing a gun at us. But there is probably room in it for an instruction that in effect says: beware of people who throw things at you. And the nervous system springs into action in milliseconds. Learning, in short, is the handmaid of instinct. Pareto's work on the human biogram will show that the instinctual thrust underlying learning predisposes us to certain classes of behavior. It is the search for such classes that, according to Pareto, makes a scientific discipline out of sociology. Sentiments of Innovation The residues are grouped into six classes. Four of these are of special importance for current sociological interests. Given space re- strictions, I shall therefore focus briefly on these only. 2 Figuring as a force in a vast number of facts is an inclination to combine certain things or ideas with certain other things or ideas. We join a piece of wood with a piece of steel and get thereby a hammer. The death of Christ is associated with a particular day of the week, and the result is "black Friday." The scientist combines two propositions in a given way, and out comes a theorem. Examples are legion. We are dealing with the fundamental, irreducible, forces underlying socio-cultural change. The "Instinct for Combinations" (889-990) is intensely powerful in the human species and has probably been one of the important factors in civilization. It is the source of the inventive faculty, the ingeniousness, originality, creativity, imagination, experimentation, and curiosity of the species. Pareto discusses eleven sentiments under the general heading of instinct for combinations. Here we can touch briefly only on a few. We may begin with the sentiment termed Generic Combinations (892- 909). The sentiment encompasses a large class of phenomena. People everywhere have believed that by reciting certain words, sometimes in a particular sequence; by performing certain acts; by joining together certain properties; by these and analogous practices, certain effects can be brought about. These may concern the requital of love; the cure for 2 The other two are Sex (1324-96) and the Need for Activity - or Self- expression - (1089-1112). A case can, of course, be made in favor of the great significance of these two classes.</page><page sequence="10">142 J. LOPREATO epilepsy or impotence; the completion of a safe voyage; communication with the dead. Examples are legion. Gambling is widespread in today's society. In the United States of America estimates of gambling turnover run as high as $75 billion a year. That places gambling among the biggest commercial activities in the nation. All cross the country many thousands of individuals behave like Dostoyevsky's compulsive gambler who, cleaned down to the last coin reserved for food, inexorably returns to the gambling table only to lose that as well. Why has gambling become such a popular pastime? Why do some individuals behave like the millions of proles in George Orweirs Oceania for whom betting was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive? There are many possible answers to the question, of course. Where, for example, money has become the measure of all things, it is only natural that people will have great avidity for it and employ any means at their disposal to attain it. Little wonder then that crime and gambling are so intimately interconnected - crime big and small alike. Fundamentally, however, the passion for gambling is the logical result of a mind gone berserk with the need to control the environment. It is linked to the chief gods of modern, rationalistic culture: Speed, Numbers, and Sports. Today the instinct for combinations impels the individual to proceed on the assumption that the unknown is knowable, and the impossible, possible. Gambling is a sort of challenge to the tenacity of what Sumner (1906) termed the aleatory element the element of chance in nature. It is, thus, also a kind of personal tax that is perversely levied upon the self for a temerarious assault on the lingering mysteries and dominance of the environment. Under a general heading termed Combinations of Similars or Oppo- sites (910-43), Pareto discusses five varieties. A couple of them are especially instructive. One, termed the sentiment of Generic Likeness or Oppositeness (913-21), is very important for understanding a large class of phenomena comprising prejudice, discrimination, ethnic stratification, marital choice, etc. It entails a deliberate search for similarities and, less frequently, for contrasts. The first part of it may be termed the Tribal Instinct. People at all times have shown a marked tendency to marry within the same race, the same ethnic group, the same religion, even the same social class. The tribal instinct suggests that the tendency to select the marriage partner within the same group satisfies a tendency to identify with people featuring one's own traits. The tendency is known as "assortative mating" in behavior genetics and suggests the extent to which phenotype works at the service of genotype. It has been suggested that racial prejudice may be an irrational generalization of kin-selected tendency to identify with individuals of similar physical characteristics and to be ill-disposed toward those who are different in appearance (e.g., Dawkins, 1976 : 108; see also Barash, 1977 : 310-11). The sentiment in question is also the source of the tendency to reason by analogy (921). Consequently, it performs a capital function in the production of knowledge and of culture in general. Analogies play many</page><page sequence="11">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 143 roles. At bottom, they are tools with which the human mind constructs avenues of approach among sets of facts, systems of explanation, and the like; that is, it proposes classifications of facts and thus organizes our reality. Through analogies, the mind, therefore, discovers systems of order in nature and creatively unfolds their boundaries. It is probably a truism that without analogies, science (to say nothing of philosophy and literature) would grow at a much slower pace, if at all. Like meta- phors and allegories, analogies, however, are not without danger. As demonstrations, for Pareto they had not the slightest scientific value. Formally, their usefulness lies in the fact that they are often a means of getting from the known to the unknown (1614). That is, useful analogies are devices built on the model of established theories for heuristic pur- poses only. Another exceedingly important tendency treated under the present general rubric is the sentiment of Assimilation (937-43). Ritual Con- sumption is a better term. "Human beings have often believed that by eating certain substances one may come to partake of the properties of those substances" (937). The force in question figures heavily in mytho- logy, and played an important role in Freud's (1918) psychology (cf. Levi-Strauss, 1962). Again, ethnographic literature abounds with accounts of peoples who have eaten their neighbors and enemies "in order to" become possessed of their strength or other qualities. Other facts will seem even more far-fetched, but deserve consideration. From time to time, scientific committees of the United Nations and maverick physicians everywhere inform us that more than eight out of ten maladies are self-curing, and that indeed most of the drugs we take are more detrimental than beneficial. Yet every year we consume count- less tons of them. Why? Because we are ignorant, wasteful, misled? Possibly, in part. But there may be something else underlying this behavior, and we have a good clue to it. It is a well-known fact that sick individuals sometimes become well after receiving inert medication. We tend to attribute such a fact to the "mysterious" workings of the mind. That is a good beginning, but a more discrete cause may be the operation of a phylogenetically selected need to consume substances in order to transform an existing physical or moral state. If the need is for the consumption per se, what is consumed may be unimportant, provided that the belief exists that the appropriate substance is indeed consumed. A common form of ritual consumption in the Christian tradition is the phenomenon of communion. Many Christians still believe that, sym- bolically at least, they partake thereby of the body of Christ. But the practice, with minor variations, was widespread among the ancient peoples of the Mediterranean basin. Initiates in the Eleusinian mysteries, for example, drank the cyceon, a substance made of water, flour, grated mint leaves, and often wine. Social scientists have had no end of difficulty in explaining ritual consumption. The problem may lie in not recognizing that, even if the form of the practice differs widely, the underlying force is probably not</page><page sequence="12">144 J. LOPREATO at all different from that behind the Christian communion. That is the fundamental reason for Pareto's emphasis on the sentiments as expla- natory variables: "science looks for constant elements in phenomena in order to get at uniformities" (218). Scientists do have an interest in the great variety of rituals practiced; the great number of diverse substances consumed; the plethora of popular explanations given for such acts. But they look for a common explanation when they observe the fickleness of the subject matter. What matters, more, is that the ritual practice of consuming substances to partake of their properties is universal. The sentiment in question, thus, helps to put together and explain a large number of seemingly disparate social facts. In this sense, the hypo- thesized sentiment epitomizes a scientific uniformity. Conversely, if we seek to explain as distinct entities the behavoiral forms treated above and the multiplicity of those left out, we fail to recognize the denominator common to them all. And that necessarily leads to theoretical frustrations that render scientific laws Chimera-like fictions. If we, for instance, focus on the Christian communion, we find that its form, the liturgy surrounding it, the means employed, and its explanations vary considerably in time and along with theological differ- entiation. A science that would not seek the common denominator is a science that would discard scientific laws as fast as it seeks to construct them. The piece de resistance among the sentiments of combination is the Hunger for Logical Developments (972-75). It is perhaps the most inten- sely human trait, but it is a special case of a curiosity instinct, or exploratory drive, that is a broadly adaptive trait of many species (Hardy, 1965 : 172). It refers in part to what Dobzhansky (1962 : 214) has termed "the restless and ostensibly idle and pointless curiosity that is expressed in the urge to explore, to pry into the nature of things, and to enjoy forms, sounds, colors, and thoughts and ideas." It entails the tendency to solve problems and to provide reasons and explanations for observ- ations, experiences, sensations. It is also the source of human conscious- ness - consciousness of self as well as of the environment. Hence the tendency to find the explanation of events and observations not only in transcendental fictions and natural forces but also in the human will. The still strong rationalistic bias in social science - the tendency to locate cause in human will - is in part based on this sentiment. Un- controlled, it leads away from, interferes with, the evolutionary or histor- ical approach to human behavior and institutions. The need to explain is inexhaustible. The human imagination is always looking for causes: the causes behind the Creation, the purposes for which human life was ordained, the causes of good and evil, the causes of tides, of capitalism and communism, of happiness and misery. When it does not find causes, it invents them. Hence, the sentiment here in question plays a crucial role in the rise of theology, of metaphysics, of the arts and sciences, of all systems of knowledge. These kinds of activity are manifestations of one same force, on the extinction of which they would vanish simultaneously.</page><page sequence="13">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 145 It is useful now to return momentarily to the learning-versus-instinct controversy. Learning, we may say, is what takes place when the hunger for logical developments is released. For, this sentiment results not only in all manner of intellectual productions and discoveries; in the process, the mind consumes and stores knowledge as well. Thus, most human behavior is the immediate result of learning. We are now in a position to add that the more intense the hunger for logical developments, the further removed is behavior from instinct pure and simple (understood as a force unmodifiable by experience). The sentiment is responsible for the crystallization of complex behavioral formations that range far and wide from the simple reflex responses. Therefore, this sentiment, while itself an instinct, is a force that encroaches on the other instincts, setting up various strata of derived behavioral tendencies and relegating instinct to the status of a distant and hidden determinant of the final instance. This is to a large extent work of deception, perhaps the major impediment to a scientific sociology. Sentiments of Persistence The sentiments of combinations account to a large extent for what is known as social differentiation, one of the fundamental processes of sociocultural evolution (Spencer, 1897, 1915; Parsons, 1966). Most new combinations are ephemeral. Else, sooner or later everything would be new at any given moment. However, after a combination has been formed, "an instinct very often comes into play that tends with varying energy to prevent the things so combined from being disjoined... This instinct may be compared roughly to mechanical inertia; it tends to resist the movement imparted by other instincts" (992). The instinct in question refers to a class of ten sentiments that Pareto terms "persistences." Combinations and persistences may be fruitfully understood as repre- senting two sets of forces in dynamic tension and complementarity at once. From one perspective, they may be viewed as phylogenetic adaptations working in tandem and reflecting the organism ic needs to deal with both change and stability in the environment. They thus reveal both the ability to cope with the new, or to bring it about, and a tendency to be attached to fixed behavioral forms. The capacity for the new enables us to absorb knowledge and to react to specific, idiosyncratic features of immediate contigencies arising during the unique course of our life histories. Fixed behaviors are efficient in coping with environmental regularities that have exerted continuous selective pressure during the evolution of the species (Waddington, 1957 : Chap. 5; Dobzhansky, 1967 : 15-16; Lorenz and Ley- hausen, 1973). Accordingly, it is in the persistences that are located the forces accounting for the formation and endurance of the socio-cultural institutions: family, religion, economy, social stratification, law, know- ledge - in short, the entire institutional framework. From another perspective, there is a relationship of dynamic tension between combinations and persistences. That is due to the fact that inno- 10</page><page sequence="14">146 J. LOPREATO vation, in addition to adding to the existing sociocultural repertoire, substitutes existing patterns with new ones. That often clashes with established ways of doing and thinking. It is, therefore, the function of the persistences to check the pace and the scope of transformation. That is why most combinations are ephemeral. In being the judges in the final instance of what shall be added into, and abstracted from, the social order, the persistences are for socio- cultural systems roughly what natural selection is for the rest of the animal kingdom. Specifically, the persistences perform a role analogous to the reproductive system in biological evolution. In an intricate interplay with the other classes of the sentiments, they determine which socio- cultural traits shall be selected for and which shall be selected against. This complex subject is being developed in a different context. One of the especially noteworthy sentiments of persistence is Relations with Places (1041-42). This trait has received a great deal of attention in biology and to a lesser extent in sociology (e.g., van den Berghe, 1974) under various labels; "territoriality" has perhaps the widest diffusion. It refers to a number of phenomena (Wilson, 1975: Chap. 12; Barash, 1977: Chap. 9), but it is most commonly employed in the sense of "defended area" or defense of a relatively fixed space (Barash, 1977 : 254). Pareto uses it in two main senses. One is identical to the concept of defended area. "On the shores of the Lake of Geneva," he observes, for example, "one may see flocks of swans each of which occupies a certain area of the lake. If a swan of one flock tries to invade the territory of another flock, it is attacked, beaten, driven off" (256 x). Ter- ritoriality, thus, is an important parameter of aggressive behavior. Wil- son (1975 : 249) notes: "The strongest evoker of aggressive response in animals is the sight of a stranger, expecially a territorial intruder." For Pareto all the sentiments of persistence "stimulate the belligerent spirit." They are "the foundations of society," and natural selection has favored behavior that enhances group life and defends its underpinnings. The second sense of Pareto's concept of territoriality is similar to the German concept of Ortstreue, namely the tendency of individuals to return to ancestral places for a variety of "reasons," for example, re- production and feeding. Its most striking manifestation is in the fixed migration routes of birds and mammals (Wilson, 1975 : 168). Other examples include the class reunions and the frequently associated return to the favorite "watering holes" of college days; the visits of immigrants to the home country; nostalgia for the home town; the return to the ancestral lands often observed, for example, among American Indians; and the current search for African roots among Black Americans. Evi- dence of territorial behavior in many species, including our own, is copious (see Stokes, 1974). The persistence sentiments are the bases of that intensely social feeling that both Durkheim and Pareto term "religious." The Persistence of Relations between the Living and the Dead (1052-55) is a sentiment that attests to the fact. "The sum of relations between an individual and other individuals persists, by abstraction, in the absence of that individual</page><page sequence="15">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 147 or after his death" (1052). There appears to be a powerful tendency according to which the individuality of a person is a unit over the course of time. It underlies the human "denial of death." The sentiment helps to explain beliefs and practices that figure in vast numbers of phenomena: for example, honoring the dead, belief in immortality, funerals and com- memorations, ghosts and other apparitions. It is generally believed, for example, that honoring the dead pre- supposes belief in the immortality of the soul. That belief, however, clashes with a variety of facts. Atheists and other agnostics who hold no supernatural beliefs, for instance, are no less meticulous in honoring the dead - not to mention the fact that in many cities there are cemeteries for pets to whom no immortal soul is attributed. The isolation of this residue is a particularly creative feat on Pareto's part. Basically, it seems to me, he is directing attention to a problem that is central to ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism. As psychocultural beings with a keen capacity for symbolization, we are to a high degree the product of significant others who have entered our conscience and consciousness. The death of these other persons would in principle, therefore, produce an intolerable discontinuity within our- selves, unless somehow the departed managed to survive in our memory and sense of being. But the step from abstraction to personification is often merely a matter of a label, a name. I am guessing at the possible origin of the concepts of spirits and the-world-beyond. I have no space to develop the point here, but elsewhere I shall argue that this is both a less metaphysical beginning to Durkheim's (1912) ingenious theory of religion and, in association with related considerations, the avenue to roughly the same conclusion. Variations in the intensity of the sentiment in question are responsible for some very interesting facts. When, for example, the sentiment is intense, the dead may actually materialize in the minds of the living. Ghosts and such other apparitions, then, are real indeed; they are the tangible forms assumed by the sentiment. By analogy and extension, the same may be said of apparitions of deities, angels, fairies, devils, and the like. Likewise, it is probably safe to assume that, while there is a great deal of fakery and fraud associated with seances and related phenomena, at least some of the claims made in favor of such practices may be true enough in the experiences of the participants. It certainly should be no surprise to learn that, according to a Gallup poll, 54 percent of all Americans believe in angels, and about 40 percent believe in devils. One in nine believes in ghosts, and about eight out of a hundred say that they have even seen one (Newsweek, 1978). When conversely the sentiment is weak, numbers of phenomena indi- cating a dread of death make their appearance. Mortality becomes an obsession, for the end of earthly life offers a void, annihilation, rather than the continuance of meaningful relationships. Modern people suffer from this affliction. For some time now, we have been bombarded with messages over the public media exhorting us to save our breath, not to waste a life, to take care of those little cells in our ears, to have our</page><page sequence="16">148 J. LOPREATO blood pressure taken - it is enough to scare us stiff. And scared we are. The skyrocketing rates of suicide attest to that. As Durkheim (1912) noted, the intense fear of death makes life unbearable: an endless vigil to the dreaded hour. Many cannot bear the wait. They get it over with quickly. Sentiments of Egoism The remaining two sets of sentiments selected for discussion may be termed "egoism" and "sociality," respectively. They, too, may be viewed as sets of forces that are complementary and in a relation of dialectical tension at the same time. Social life entails a certain compromise between a purely selfish pursuit of goals and what has been termed "the common good." Social order is basically a process in which we observe a tendency toward the resolution of conflict between these two levels of utility. The central stage among the selfish sentiments is occupied by "inte- rest," namely impulses to acquire material goods that are useful, or merely pleasurable, for purposes of living, as well as to seek social recognition and honor (2009). Interests are of such great intrinsic im- portance that they are abstracted from the sentiments of egoism and entered as an element in its own right in Pareto's general system (1207). However, because he dedicated practically his entire economics to them (e.g., Pareto, 1896-97, 1906), they do not figure to any large extent in his sociology. Nevertheless, taking the liberty of reducing extremely complex subject matter to gross simplification, we may say that their basic message is much in keeping with the logic of natural selection. From the perspective of this principle, the basic tendency is the maxi- mization of ego's own survival chances. More specifically, according to an eminently readable and informative recent publication, the individual may be viewed as a "survival machine behaving as if it has the [main] 'purpose' of preserving its genes" (Dawkins, 1976 : 140). Interests impel toward the accumulation of wealth, power, and influence. These, of course, have great survival value. Powerful support for this thesis of the selfish tendency transpires from the Sentiments of Equality in Inferiors (1220-28). Individuals who are motivated by this sentiment are generally convinced that they seek equality, or at least a fair deal, for all. Thus, in their public activities they harp on the sophistry termed "accord with collective interest" (1498- 1500). Scratch a collectivism however, and behold the clutches of the most shameless self-seeker. The sentiment of equality in inferiors is really a mechanism whereby we often lift ourselves from a lower position to a higher one. It is analogous to the force that, for example, impels a lion seal without a harem to engage in combat a more fortunate one with a view to gaining control over the harem. The difference lies chiefly in the fact that among humans there is all manner of chatter coating the underlying motive with altruistic rationalizations. Likewise, if indi- viduals talk of the interests of their social class as a whole instead of</page><page sequence="17">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 149 personal interest, it is because that is the acceptable mode of expression and because they are often unaware of the difference existing between real and apparent motivations. In short, the class struggle is real enough, but upon close examination it is really an individual struggle. The sentiment of equality in inferiors is really a sentiment of privilege. It provides the impetus to scale the walls of inequality in order to improve one's own condition. During this stage, the individual is rich of talk about equality, justice, fairness, classlessness, and the like. Once success has been attained, however, the need for a society protected by hindrances against the less fortunate takes over. "People agitate for equality to get equality in general, and then go on to make countless numbers of dis- tinctions to deny it in the particular" (1222). It follows that the "sen- timent of equality" is, paradoxically, one of the fundamental causes of enduring inequality. Thus, it is a misnomer. Yet, without it, given dis- tributions of power and influence would remain undisturbed. Social mobility might be nonexistent. Even the most competent and the worthiest might be content to live in a state of quiescent behavior. There would be no competition to relieve discontent and grievance. Worse still, from an evolutionary perspective, ruling classes would deteriorate to levels that invite predation. The sentiment in question, therefore, is a force of revolution as well as inequality. Decaying governing classes are subject to its inexorable drive and are devastated by it. The new governing class usually brings new vigor to the machine of government. It follows that the sentiment of equality (or privilege, as we might more rightly term it) has the adaptive value of maximizing the probability of societal survival. Another sentiment of the present class is equally noteworthy for the dramatic way in which it underscores the tendency toward self-centered behavior. Pareto (1312-23) terms it Restoration of Integrity by Acts Pertaining to the Offender. We may more conveniently term it the Sentiment of Vengeance. It recalls the eye-for-an-eye principle of the Old Testament. It is a force that impels humans and animals alike to return harm for harm received. The individual receiving a wrong exper- iences "a sense of discomfort, as if something were wrong with him." He rids himself of the discomfort by performing certain acts against the offender. Vengeance is related to hatred, and hatred is often rooted in fear (1313). Hence, the greater the fear underlying the hatred, the more violent the vengeance. Conversely, when fear wanes, hatred tends to abate and turns to contempt. The need for vengeance often extends beyond the actual offender. When, for example, the family is the social unit, a transgression by only one of its members may be attributed to and avenged upon the family as a whole. The same may be said of an entire community or society. The reverse case is also true. The offender sometimes turns out to be a whole nation, or perhaps more clearly its state. The citizen who is far from home and in the midst of the "offended" is now in danger. A good illustration is the storming of the American embassy in Teheran and the taking of its occupants as hostages.</page><page sequence="18">150 J. LOPREAT0 Sentiments of Sociality Life in society necessarily rests on a certain reciprocal goodwill between individual and individual. The sentiment may be weak or strong, but it cannot be entirely wanting. It is manifested in both animals and human beings in acts of mutual assistance and common defence... (1145). Pareto isolates thirteen sentiments of the present class. They are forces whose ultimate function is to maintain the collective or social existence. If the persistence sentiments are responsible for the institutionalization of innovated behavior, sociality sentiments ultimately underlie behavior that supports that institutionalization. They are thus forces of social order. As such, they are rich of theoretical significance. We may begin by noting that, as the above quotation suggests, they provide a strong clue to the very probable presence in human society of genuinely altruistic behavior, a problem that is intensely debated nowadays among socio- biologists. Some evidence of such behavior consists of facts that lead Pareto (1145-52) to speak of a tendency toward Self-Sacrifice for the Good of Others. The ultimate expression of this sentiment is manifested in Risking One's Life (1 148). Facts from biology, however, tend to cast doubt on the genuinely altruistic hypothesis suggested by this sentiment, and we had best continue by turning to them briefly. Instinctive defense of the group attains its maximum in the social insects among whom soldier castes are pro- grammed exclusively for combat and group defense (Wilson, 1975 :47). Primates and vertebrates are different in this respect, but they often do take grave risks in defense of the group. When chacma baboon troops forage, for example, the dominant males have sometimes been observed to take up exposed positions; and, when they see predators or rival troops approaching, they bark the danger signal and sometimes even approach and, at some danger to themselves, threaten the intruders (Wilson 1975 : 121-22). Birds practice a variety of "distraction displays" that are an exquisite challenge to the human art of deception. A common technique is injury feigning. Fearing intruders, the female nighthawk, for example, flies from her nest at conspicuously low levels, inviting them away from the nest and finally settling on the ground in front of the intruders with wings drooping or outstretched. The prairie warbler plummets to the ground from the nest and grovels frantically in front of the intruder (Wilson, 1975:122-23; see also Guthrie-Smith, 1925; Armstrong, 1947; Gramza, 1967). Analogous facts are commonplace in the animal king- dom. As a consequence, unless we humans wish to continue blindly in our excessive emphasis on reason and culture, we must alternatively consider that when a soldier flings himself on top of a grenade to save his buddies, he engages in an analogous, perhaps homologous, act, how- ever noble his thoughts may be at the time of his self-immolation. Sociobiologiste are strongly inclined to discount these facts as evidence of genuinely altruistic behavior. They do so in part on inferential grounds:</page><page sequence="19">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 151 genes - those pieces of molecules that may be viewed as "instructions" for anatomic, physiological, and behavioral developments - replicate themselves as cells divide. In so doing they clearly behave as if self- transmission to future generations were their ultimate goal - and con- founded be the group! This is the hypothesis of "the selfish gene." Sociobiologists incline toward this hypothesis also on the basis of very compelling facts. Many apparent acts of alleged altruism - technically definable as action that tends to favor the survival of the recipient's genes while lowering that of the actor's genes - turn out to be quite selfish; in selfishness, the relationship in this definition is reversed (see, for an overview, Trivers, 1971; Dawkins, 1976). The moment of triumph for the hypothesis of selfishness came with Hamilton's (1964: see also Trivers and Hare, 1976) discovery that the "workers" among the insects of the Hymenoptera group are genetically closer to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring if they were queens. The important fact, of course, is that the workers do not have offspring of their own. Why then are those creatures, seemingly in contravention of natural selection, exceedingly diligent in catering to the needs of their mother, the queen, and her continual production of brood? That query was long an embarrassment for the hypothesis of selfishness. The first step to the solution of the seeming paradox lies in the recognition that one can transmit one's genes to future generations not merely through one's own offspring but also through siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts, and so forth. In short, there is "inclusive fitness" through "kin selection." The next step concerns the discovery of a very odd system of sex deter- mination among such insects. The males, sometimes known as drones or kings, are fatherless: they are the offshoots of unfertilized eggs. That is, they carry only one-half the full complement of chromosomes. Their sisters, the diligent workers, have both a father and a mother; and they have a full set of chromosomes. But note now: on the father's side- workers are genetically identical, for they have inherited the same set (the entirely) of his chromosomes. On the mother's side, each has in- herited half her full complement of chromosomes, but not the same half. Now, Mendel's First Law shows that on the average full siblings (like the workers) share 50 percent of their genes with one another by virtue of the fact that each has inherited an identical 25 percent of the genes from the father and an identical set of 25 percent from the mother. But we must now recall that the workers, being identical on the father's side, actually share on this side not the usual 25 percent of their genes but 50 percent: namely, half of their full complement of chromosomes. When we add their common 50 percent on the father's side to the 25 percent shared on the mother's side, we find that it is genetically quite to the interest of the workers to be without offspring of their own. For if they did have their own offspring, they would be sharing only 50 percent of their genes with them. For purposes of genetic transmission to future generations, it is, then, better to have a sister as queen than a daughter. Returning more directly to Pareto now, it bears noting that, while he did isolate a sentiment of self-sacrifice for the good of others, evidence of genuine altruism did not seem overwhelming to him. Indeed, he</page><page sequence="20">152 J. LOPREATO explicitly states that others tend to benefit from our actions either merely through unintended consequences ("incidental effects") of those actions or through intended effects that have served us first (Vol. 4, passim). The point is conveyed clearly in his discussion of a milder expression of the sentiment of self-sacrifice for others, which is termed Sharing One's Property with Others. He finds extremely little evidence for it (1 149-52). We must, therefore, search for other facts and sentiments if we must arrive at, or even come close to, a tenable hypothesis of genuine altruism in Homo sapiens. An important step has been taken by biologist Robert Trivers (1971). This scholar presents a model showing how altruistic behavior of a sort can be selected for without invoking any assumptions about kinship. Indeed, the model accounts for "altruism" even in inter- specific contacts - for example, in cleaning symbioses among fish. The validity of the model rests on a number of conditions that we cannot go into here. But one of the properties of social relationships that may in some sense be termed "altruistic" is quite noteworthy: it is what Trivers terms "moralistic aggression" (see also Campbell, 1975, for related argu- ments). We have already encountered it under the guise of the Sentiment of Vengeance. If I scratch your back, as we may say in a related exchange-theory context (e.g. Homans, 1974), and you refuse to scratch mine, I can lash at you with moral whips and thus tend to undermine future selfish, or "cheating," behavior. We are, thus, closer to genuine altruism although, as Trivers himself notes, we have not yet quite reached it, for we are dealing with behavior that, through reciprocal acts, in the long run benefits the "altruist." Nevertheless, the costs entailed in moralistic aggression against cheating almost certainly favored the selection of individuals who could play by the rules of the game - the selection of reciprocators or con- formists. And this brings Pareto's Need for Conformity (1115-32) into action. There are two phases to it. If a person departs from the uniform rule, his conduct seems to jar, and produces, quite apart from any reasoning a sense of discomfort in the persons associated with him. An effort is made to eliminate the jar, now by persuasion, more often by censure, more often still by force (1126). This is Enforced Conformity (1126-29). Generally, the more strongly held is a rule, a value, the greater is the tendency to defend it by resort to force. Herein lies the danger of the true believer, the Democrat of democrats, the "true" communist, the ethically pure. But, due to the costs of non-conformity alluded to just above, enforced conformity ends by becoming Voluntary Conformity (1117-25). Pareto likens it to imitation. "Human beings," sociobiologist Wilson (1975 : 562) has remarked, "are absurdly easy to indoctrinate - they seek it." Both Wilson and Pareto are probably on the mark, however much the truth may offend our sensibilities. Voluntary conformity is a crucial aspect of social order not only because it helps to avoid punishment but also because it is a sort of teacher built into each of us; it facilitates</page><page sequence="21">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 153 the process of socialization. Voluntary conformity grants us a learning shortcut, quicker and more efficient than individual trial-and-error. The tendency is probably related also to the evolution of group de- fense that is a cheracteristic of innumerable species; that means that once group defense was evolved, conformity came to attain survival value for the individual. In his work on sparrow hawks, Mueller (1971), for example, demonstrates the working of the "oddity factor" whereby oddly colored mice are preferred as prey by the hawks. In humans, the pheno- menon of the scapegoat, or more simply the "goat" in small group research, seems to be just of that nature. But if voluntary conformity came to have adaptive value, it could not entirely satisfy, as it were, the cheating, thrust of the selfish gene. Its retention in evolution, therefore, may have been aided by reinforcing agents. One such reinforcer was probably what Pareto (1160-62) and several other sociologists (e.g., Thomas, 1923) have termed the Need for Social Approval (recognition, etc.). "The need that the individual feels for being well regarded by his group, for winning its approval, is a very powerful sentiment. On it human society may be said to rest" (1 160). Currently, the sentiment of social approval occupies a crucial role in exchange theory (Blau, 1964; Homans, 1974) - and not without justi- fication, for nearly all manifestations of the sentiments of sociality are accompanied by a desire for the approval of others, or tor avoiding their censure. We need take but one more step and we catch a glimpse of genuine altruism. The sentiments we have been speaking about are social forces properly speaking. Social because however, biological our orientation, they are phenomena of societal populations. Forces because, of course, they have a causative thrust. But they are social forces in dynamic equilibrium, even in a state of tension with one another and other, related facts. Dynamic equilibria are by definition precarious. It follows that the need for social approval - indeed, all the forces we have appealed to - can oscillate rather wildly. I now wish to suggest that it can, under some circumstances which I leave to others to specify, reach such a high intensity that the individual is capable of doing anything, including self- immolation, to attain it. Pareto came very close to generating such an hypothesis of genuine, non-self-serving, altruism (1147). And we might further focus on his exceeding sensitivity to the facts of self-deception in human beings in order to press our hypothesis further. Indeed, in another context, I argue, for example, that self-deception led to a sublimation of the thrust of the selfish gene, with its demand for eternal salvation, into the concept of the soul, which with few exceptions attains eternal salvation in all reli- gions through self-sacrifice and the good works. We conclude this section, however, with a brief reference to an im- portant, and related, behavioral predisposition. Pareto (1163) terms it Asceticism. It is a sentiment that under some circumstances prompts "the human being to seek sufferings or abstain from pleasures without design of personal advantage, to go counter to the instinct that impels</page><page sequence="22">154 J. LOPREATO living creatures to seek pleasurable things and avoid painful things." This tendency fits exactly the previously encountered technical definition of genuine altruism; for this reason we may more appropriately term it ascetic altruism. Examples of ascetic altruism are numerous. The clearest refer to certain types of reproductively relevant behavior, for example, monastic chastity. The case of Mother Theresa, the 1979 Nobel Prize winner for peace, is the prototype of the ascetically altruistic individual. The Utility of the theory of the Biogram What is the value of the theory of the human biogram, as herein inter- preted? We may begin with the following statement by Pareto (1690 2): "Our aim in these volumes is to constitute a science of sociology by stopping at residues just as the philologist stops at roots, the chemist at elements (simple bodies), the student of celestial mechanics at universal attraction, and so on." Pareto's aim, in short, was the quest for "con- stancies," for the uniformities of fact that exercise the special interest of the scientist as contrasted to the artist and the person of letters. Those uniformities are termed "laws," though without much inclination to quibble about words (Chap. I). Residues, therefore, are strictly speak- ing the materials in terms of which sociological laws may be stated. Pareto's theoretical strategy may be underscored by continuing briefly our discussion of asceticism. The theoretical import of "asceticism" may be termed a uniformity, a law, by virtue of the fact that it epitomizes a large body of facts. Suppose we begin with a Christian man who does penance of some sort. Shall sociologists conclude that the cause of the penance is his alleged belief in a God who accepts self-inflicted pain as a means of self-redemption? If our focus is on the manner is which beliefs are associated with actions, the conclusion is certainly justified. But that freezes us at a level of scientific explanation that is utterly ad hoc. Another man at another time and place will give another expla- nation for his penance. That makes the above explanation uncomfortably fickle. It is adequate at best to cast light on specific acts in specific times and places. But that, we still say in some of our introductory texts with a touch of self-congratulation, is the way of history, not of sociology, which is alleged to be a nomothetic, or law-like, discipline. If we are serious about our discipline's being a search for scientific laws, we must, therefore, widen the circle and see whether the penance of the Christian falls in a larger class of phenomena. We find, for example, that the Greek Cynics were famous for their asceticism, and yet they had no religious conception of their penance. The Spartans were superb at suffering pain as a means of maintaining strict military dis- cipline. Their predilection for flagellation was later matched by Christian penitents in the Middle Ages. The Buddhists have practiced asceticism in attempts to stultify their vital energies. Certain tribes of American Indians chopped off their fingers and suffered various other wounds for a variety of "reasons."</page><page sequence="23">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 155 Illustrations are literally numberless. Among the extreme cases of asceticism, first preference would probably go to the Stylites, individuals of uncanny Christian faith who in penance spent portions of their lives on top of columns, a practice that lasted at least four hundred years into the ninth century. The amazing thing in a sense is that identical cases are observable in history in places where there was no trace whatever of Christianity. The author of the Syrian Goddess, for example, discusses at some length the behavior of people who were Stylites in all but the name. Phenomena that are in all probability homologous take place every day under our very eyes. In recent times, asceticism evolved mainly into prohibitionism. It entailed abstinence from sex, or at least a holy horror of the sexual urge. It presumably reached its peak in the Victorian age, and has recently been vigorously challenged by the "sex revolution." In the United States of America, several decades ago prohibitionism focused on alcoholic beverages and managed to become a constitutional amend- ment. Perhaps the most common, and durable, form of asceticism concerns fasting, which has been a feature of many peoples on all continents. Until only a few years ago, Catholics, for example, were forbidden to eat meat on Fridays and on certain other days of the Christian calendar. Fasting raises some very interesting questions. Today, in Euro-American countries at least, abstinence from food for religious "reasons" is un- common. But countless millions diet, allegedly for health or esthetic reasons. Again in the United States, a hungrier-than-thou way of life is sweeping the land. There is an industry of lose-weight techniques that involves billions of dollars. The book industry on dieting probably far surpasses in volume the distribution of all sociology books. Television idols host programs on weight-losing. The P.T.L. Club, a Christian network that is on the air around the clock and reaches many millions of people throughout the world, addresses weight-losing as one of its principal issues. Millions upon millions are dieting. Shall we accept uncritically the reasons given for dieting, which propose consideration of health and beauty? Frankly, obesity is a "problem." But if we do, we may fall victims to one of our most unique traits: self-deception. Chances are that today's fasting is at least in part the manifestation of the same primeval force that accounted for the dieting of times gone by. Certainly, the fact is that for one alleged reason or another people have always fasted. This constant fact demands scientific recourse to a constant force. The point is that without that force, without the sentiment of asceticism, there would probably be no fasting even for esthetic reasons. From this viewpoint, we may now appreciate the fact that the evolu- tionary perspective is useful not so much, perhaps, because it postulates genetic forces of behavior. For us sociologists, it is compelling because it seeks causes that, hopefully with an acceptable degree ot parsimony, organize large classes of facts recurrent in time and space. We, of course, must recognize the elements of uniqueness in such practices, and</page><page sequence="24">156 J. LOPREATO I shall say a word about that in due course. But their partial originality of form and means employed does not gainsay the usefulness of their common classification for certain theoretical purposes - just as the many differences of various sorts existing among birds, reptiles, fish, and mammals do not contest the usefulness of classifying all four categories among the chordata. It bears being reminded of the philosopher M. R. Cohen (1946), who added matchless elegance essentially to the sort of message we are trying to convey: "our view of the human scene becomes narrow, unilluminated, and passionate if we do not rise above its im- mediate urgency and see it in its cosmic roots and backgrounds." I think there is no disagreement in sociology that we lack a coherent theoretical framework, a "paradigm" in T. S. Kuhn's (1962) terminology. A scientific paradigm provides a basic interpretive scheme, an efficient servant of the searching mind that calls into explanatory action roughly the same faithful forces in one theoretical challenge after another. A paradigm, thus, provides the tools that lure researchers to focal points of theory. It is this action that after all results in cumulative knowledge, in theoretical systems worthy of the name. Theories like the one we have dealt with perform a number of functions in addition to the synthetic one emblazoned by the notion of paradigm. Let me mention three briefly. First, they underscore the value and extend the scope of the comparative method, which, in the absence of the data and the conditions required by the classical experimental methods, appears to be the sine qua non approach to any historically relevant phenomenon. The extension lies in the fact that, having done a measure of comparative work (not enough, we would all probably agree) across sociocultural systems, we can now accept the challenge, however circumspectly at first, of glancing curiously across the social systems of multiple species, espe- cially those most closely related to us. Second, such classifications serve an organizational function. That is, they: (a) help to identify phenomena that have been insufficiently studied; (b) serve as common guides in the study of diverse but related pheno- mena; and (c) aid in the systematic codification of already existing bodies of data. Third, they perform an analytical, anti-metaphysical, function. By this I mean that they aid in finding the constitutive, logically specifiable elements of theories. For example, there is probably no more imaginative and creative an argument in sociology than Durkheim's discussion of the relationship existing between religious facts and "society." Who does not remember with a certain sense of awe the famous statement: "So if it [the totem] is at once the symbol of the god and of the society, is that not because the god and the society are only one?" (Durkheim, 1912 :236). The disquisition that leads to and from this statement is a paragon of brilliance. But the sociologists of the years to come are likely to find it mere speculation. What is there in the nature of the human individual, they will want to know as a minimum, that makes possible behavior entailing such a truly marvelous feat: the ability to germinate a conception that at one and the same time makes an</page><page sequence="25">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 157 abstraction of society and a personification of the totemic principle? The answer, if Durkheim's equation is correct, may lie in the selection of specific human sentiments. Searching for them and the mechanisms of their emergence would greatly extend the reach and the import of Dur- kheim's theory. The theory of sentiments contains the elements precisely for that sort of theoretical enterprise. The Problem of Redaction By now the specter of reductionism has raised its ugly head many times in the mind of many a reader. But why? In fact, what reduction stands for should be pursued with alacrity. Science is the art of regress- ing the why. The unfolding of knowledge has not only a horizontal dimension, as it were; it has a perpendicular one as well. It concerns the simultaneous search for new frontiers and the intensive settlement of old ones. Reductionism, a problem of perpendicular probing, is the art of doing some sowing and harvesting on soil that has already been relatively well cultivated. In our case, it also provides parsimony - parsimony not only in the sense that the theory offered comes into service with dependable regularity but also because sociology at present employs a great and shifting variety of other explanatory schemes whose potential has so far doggedly refused to materialize. On pragmatic grounds alone, then, reduction should begin to become attractive to us. The fact is that reduction is one of the chief activities of all modern science. For example, scientific laws are stated with differential degrees of scope and informativeness. Thus, one of the more penetrating activ- ities of science concerns the reduction of some laws to others. Moreover, as Peter Medawar (1974 : 61) has argued in his discussion of the pro- blems of reduction in the natural sciences, the reducing sciences become enriched in their empirical content, and new concepts emerge at each level which simply do not appear in the reducing science. Hence, reduc- tionism should be shorn of its emotional content and viewed simply as an indispensable methodological tool. It actually enriches all the sciences, without robbing them of their relative autonomy. The psychologist Campbell (1974) has gone further and cogently shown that reduction in a sense is a poor choice of terms because resort to the theories or concepts of other sciences is really a two-way form of theoretical inquiry. Physics and chemistry, for example, can, and do, learn from sociology. It is to some extent the complexity of our systems, as we conceptualize them, that enriched the work on "dissipative structures" of the 1977 Nobel Prize winner for chemistry, Ilya Prigogine. Derivations: the Role of Reason and Culture An immensely admiring Aldous Huxley (1935 : 8) stated that the Treatise points to (among many other things) a museum of human stupidities "vaster even than Flaubert' s chamber of horrors [in Bouvard et Pecuchet]." Reference here is especially to Pareto's "derivations,"</page><page sequence="26">158 J. LOPREATO namely those variable parts that are abstracted in the search for the residues. In the illustration we have given, for instance ("it is sweet and decorous to die for one's homeland"), the derivation is the statement: "it is sweet and decorous." This part is variable in the sense that if the Romans explained self-sacrifice for the group in this fashion, the Americans will say instead that they die for their country in defense of "democracy," "freedom," "the American way of life," and so forth. The Germans, the Japanese, the French, the Iranians, and so on offer still other justifications for the act of self-immolation. Indeed, such sophis- tries vary greatly in time as well as in space, so that, for example, the French explanations for patriotism are not necessarily today what they were 500 years ago, nor what they are likely to be 500 years hence. I fully agree that the derivations are a most significant part of Pareto's sociology. I have, however, chosen to avoid a detailed treatment of these "masqueraders" and to lay the stress on that which (if we are not careful) they conceal, the sentiments, in part because of space re- strictions but in part also because the sentiments are little understood; and I wish to underscore the Paretean contribution to the development of modern evolutionary theory. A few brief comments about derivations, however, are in order. Pareto was keenly aware of the role of reason and purpose in human affairs. Both are inherent in the derivations. To a large extent, however, he accepted the naturalistic (some say "mechanistic") postulate that while the human animal is purposive and to an extent rational, the events of the world owe less to reason and purpose than most thinkers are wont to concede. It follows that from this perspective, derivations are first and foremost tools of deception, of self as well as of others. From another perspective, they are tools of persuasion, and it is from this vantage point that they are classified and discussed (Vol. III). We are now at the heart of one of the most significant problems in Pareto's sociology. How can derivations be means of persuasion if human conduct is ultimately motivated by the sentiments? They are means of persuasion because their basic function is to appeal to the sentiments. Most basically, therefore, derivations are the cultural tools that interact with and stimulate the sentiments. Derivations are the built-in mechanisms, as it were, that are constantly calling the sentiments to action. That means that they do perform an etiological role; indeed, they enter formally Pareto's general system. But their causality is secondary to the causality of the sentiments and residues. Indeed, they are the result of the sentiment termed "the hunger for logical developments." They are to a large extent an aspect of our consciousness. Consciousness, however, is time- and culture- bound. Being a characteristic of an ontogenetic individual, it tends to provide a perspective that is unique to a given time and space, and thus tends to hide more fundamental forces at work. Pareto deempha- sizes the etiology of derivations because others have treated them as basic historical forces, indeed as history itself. That is unfortunate inasmuch as from this perspective history shows neither order nor con- tinuity. Pareto's sociology, Mannheim's (1936 : 134 f) absurd misreading</page><page sequence="27">PARETO'S SOCIOLOGY IN A SOCIOBIOLOGICAL KEY 159 notwithstanding, is predicated precisely on the assumption that there is order in history. It is the order of the manner in which residues change in their distribution and intensity according to various sorts of events, rates of social mobility, and so forth. The derivations are superficial and highly variable from one generation to another, sometimes from one year to another - and even more from one place to another. As literateur Poggioli (1965 : 301) puts it, "In reality they are only an intellectual parallel of fashion." Science does not begin with fashion. But it cannot disregard it either. The reason lies in the very nature of Pareto's (and modern science's) fundamental tool of analysis: system. This heuristic directs attention to the interdependence of the variables that constitute the internal dynamics of a phenomenon. If I have em- phasized the biogram it is because there appears to me to be great need in social science for the recognition that human behavior and the socio- cultural system in general are not divorced from the ancient vicissitudes of biological evolution. In the brief comments that follow, however, I wish to emphasize the point that a fuller and more faithful reading of Pareto's sociology must proceed on the assumption that those vicissitudes have had to bear the heavy burden of culture (and the human mind). I shall make the point by analogy to Q.G. Simpson's (1949) classical definition of "adaptation," the basic process of biological evolution, as the functional interrelation- ship between organism and environment. For us, the environment of a human group consists not only of physical features but of other groups or societies as well. And these are cultural entities. The organism refers not only to the biological predispositions - the biogram - but also, in keeping with the sense of Simpson's "organism," to those other factors of our total endowment that we can bring to bear on the environment. And these include culture, of course. So, culture is both of the "organism" and of the environment. The remarkable thing about Pareto's sociology is that the fulcrum variable in his general system is the residue. This, as we have seen, refers stricto sensu to an observable cultural uniformity. But Pareto employs it also as a force inclusive of the sentiment(s) to which it corresponds. It, thus, plays the dual theoretical role ihat culture plays in our above brief analysis of socio-cultural adaptation. The parallel is not a coincidence, nor an artifact of a faulty analogy. Pareto meant to present residues as conceptual spans bridging the theoretical space between biology and culture. He also meant them to occupy an etio- logical position between the highly constant sentiments and the greatly variable derivations. Granted then that Pareto was eager to pinpoint the ancient forces, the sentiments. The fact remains that his crucial system variable is represented by the residues. That means clearly that Pareto's sociology is above all a study in the interplay between biology, culture, and reason. Moreover, inasmuch as the methodological emphasis is on residues (sen- timents are only indirectly represented in the general system), it may also be argued that, formally speaking, Pareto's sociology specializes in</page><page sequence="28">160 J. LOPREATO the study of the influence of culture on biology. As a result, it may be seen that Pareto examined culture as a selection pressure in the evolution cf our species. The emerging evolutionary science will deal kindly with Vilfredo Pareto.
