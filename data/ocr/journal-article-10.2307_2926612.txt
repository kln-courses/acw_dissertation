<plain_text><page sequence="1">Union and Disunion in "Song of Myself" HERBERT J. LEVINE Franklin and Marshall College TN I 850, when California sought to enter the Union as a non- slaveholding state, the Southern states threatened to secede unless compromises extended slavery to other territory con- quered in the Mexican war. During the acrimonious debate, the leading disunionist, John C. Calhoun, pointed out the insuffi- ciency of political rhetoric to prop up the American Union: "It cannot be saved by eulogies on the Union, however splendid or numerous. The cry of 'Union, Union, the glorious Union!' can no more prevent disunion than the cry of 'Health, health, glori- ous health!' on the part of the physician can save a patient." 1 During the I840s, Walt Whitman had offered such eulo- gies, but in his anger at the Compromise of i85o, he stopped praising so he could administer physic to a sick Union. In a group of satiric poems, he railed against the Congressional be- trayers of freedom, the very principle for which the Union had been founded. One recent study has argued that the escalating crisis of the Union allowed Whitman to discover the healing role so central to "Song of Myself."2 Another has argued that the economic downturn of i854, which put Whitman out of the housebuilding business, allowed him to discover his role as celebrator of the artisan, who was rapidly being displaced by entrepreneurs and managers of capital.3 Such studies have made obsolete the widespread view that in the i850s Whitman 1 Quoted in Paul C.

This essay seeks to anchor Whit- man's first great poem, the I855 "Song of Myself," in the politi- cal discourse of the i850s. Part I surveys that discourse in order to illuminate two important early prose statements by Whitman: the manuscript, "Slavery-the Slaveholders," and the preface to the i855 poems. Part II demonstrates that Whitman reflected contemporary political concerns in the figurative language of "Song of Myself," where we find figures of union counterpoised by figures of disunion. Finally, Part III proposes a three-part plot for "Song of Myself," a structure of Union, Disunion, and Reunion, which anticipates the painful trajectory of American destiny in the era of the Civil War. I Disunionist rhetoric, as old as anti-Federalist resistance to the Constitution, reappeared periodically through the first half of the nineteenth century. New Englanders resorted to it at the Hartford Convention after the War of i812; Southerners took it up at the time of the Missouri Compromise (I820), again during the South Carolina nullification crisis (I833), and during each of the great legislative battles over the extension of slavery in the I84os and i85os, all won by Southern interests, in part, at least, because Northerners so feared the disunion that Southerners threatened. When John Quincy Adams was prevented from pre- senting to Congress an abolitionist petition in I842, calls for disunion rose in the North and soon became an article of faith for Garrisonian abolitionists. Northern radicals kept talk of dis- union alive after every defeat for anti-slavery: the failure of the Wilmot Proviso (i847), which was to have banned slavery from the Mexican territories; the Compromise of i85o, and especially its new Fugitive Slave Law, enforceable by Federal authority; the Kansas-Nebraska Act (I854), which repealed the Missouri Compromise that had kept slavery out of most of the Louisiana Purchase territory. While this sort of disunionism was fuel for Northern aboli- tionists and Southern "fire-eaters," it was anathema to Walter Whitman, journalist and ardent nationalist. "This Union dis-</page><page sequence="3">572 American Literature solved?" he wrote in I847. "Why the very words are murky with their own most monstrous portent! And yet these wordls are flippantly turned over and over in the mouths of men, at the present time.... Thinking, as we do, that hardly any evil which could be inflicted on the people of this hemisphere, and the cause of freedom all over the world, would be so great as the disunion of these States-their parting in bitterness and ill- blood-we believe it incumbent on every Democrat always to bear testimony in the same spirit, and the same words, as one now in heaven-the Union! it must and shall be preserved!"' Nor did he adopt the rhetoric of disunion in breaking from the Democratic Party and taking up with the Free Soilers and the Free Democrats in the elections of I848 and I852. One of that party's leaders proposed in i85I that it adopt the time-honored motto of Daniel Webster, "Liberty and Union," to impress upon the electorate both its essential goals.5 Whitman preserved these goals even as political rhetoric be- came increasingly divisive and more and more Americans "came to think of themselves as forming not one but two distinct peo- ples."6 His own Senator, William H. Seward, who had vaunted the inevitable continuance of the Union in i85o had become by I854 during the Kansas-Nebraska debates a sectional tacti- cian, appealing to the North to preserve its interests, not the Union's, against a growing Southern conspiracy to extend its slaveholding empire.7 Whitman, by contrast, spoke on behalf of "all Freemen north and south . . . the whole population of the 31 states who have no human property." In a little-known prose manuscript that he entitled "Slavery-the Slaveholders-The Constitution-the true America and Americans, the laboring persons," Whitman addresses the slaveholders from a Unionist 4 The Gathering of the Forces, ed.

"Our territory of Nebraska and Kansas is wanted for our Children.... If you or your children choose to come, of course you have the same right to come that we have, and on the same terms.-This vast tract is ours-ours, the people's of the whole 31 states, north and south. . . ." To an anti-slavery advocate like Seward, the struggle over Kansas was between two systems of labor, one moral and the other immoral. To Whit- man, that moral struggle was subordinated to a more pressing political question: whether the Territories, which the Constitu- tion mandated to the whole Union, would continue to belong to the millions of free workingmen or to the few "hundreds" of slave-owners 8 The slave-owners were representative for Whitman of the capitalist class that threatened his egalitarian vision of the Union. Democracy and riches, he understood, were opposed. "For this circling Confederacy, standing together with interlinked hands, ample, equal, each one with his grip of love wedged in life or in death to all the rest, we must share and share alike. . . . If there be any of good dish, and not enough of it to go completely round, it shall not be brought on at all" (NUPM, VI, 2178-79). Opposed to this ideal was the reality of exclusive self-interest that Whitman saw everywhere around him, North and South. "Is the whole land becoming one vast model plantation, whose inhabitants suppose the ultimate and best ends of man attained when he drives a profitable business, no matter how abject the terms-and when he has enough to wear and is not bothered for pork?" (NUPM, VI, 2190). Whitman's concern for the Union is also evident in his anger at Federal enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law, which the Constitution had left up to the discretion of the States. The same week that the Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed by Congress, a fugitive slave named Anthony Burns was arrested in Boston by Federal marshals.9 Whitman's acerbic poem on the subject, 8 Noteboos and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts, ed. Edward F. Grier (New York: New York Univ. Press. I984), VI, 2I76-77; hereafter cited as NUPM within my text. The reference to thirty-one states was later amended to thirty-two, upon the admission of Minnesota in I858. 9 The order of these events structures Whitman's address, suggesting a clear date for "Slavery-the Slaveholders" in the summer of I854. Edward Grier, the editor of the manuscript, finds the circumstances of composition uncertain.</page><page sequence="5">574 American Literature included in the first Leaves of Grass (later titled "A Boston Ballad"), berates the people of Boston for letting themselves be trampled by a tyrannical authority that reminds him of George ILL. In the prose piece, he enters into the political princi- ple at stake, the Constitutional theory of states' rights that should limit the powers of the Union. Tell the Union, he exhorts an imagined audience, "that having delegated to it certain important functions, and having entered into certain important engage- ments with our brother states, we like all the rest, have reserved more important functions, embodying our primary rights, exclu- sively to ourselves" (NUPM, VI, 2I89). Whitman thus combined an egalitarian vision of Union with a fiercely individualistic view of states' rights, a balancing of the one and the many that would prove crucial in his poetic reworking of the political problems facing the American Union. Both "Slavery-the Slaveholders" and "A Boston Ballad" are fueled by Whitman's anger, which he chose to bury in order to become the healer of the nation in Leaves of Grass. In what appear to be the first notebook lines that he drafted for "Song of Myself," Whitman adopts an equalizing perspective that was inconceivable for any contemporary politician: I am the poet of slaves and of the masters of slaves I go with the slaves of the earth equally with the masters And I will stand between the masters and the slaves, Entering into both so that both shall understand me alike. (NUPM, 1, 67) The poet, Whitman says in his i855 preface, "supplies -what wants supplying and checks what wants checking, O such as checking the angry divisiveness of contemporary politics, includ- ing his own anger at the betrayals of democratic ideals, whether on the part of slaveholders, Congressmen, or Presidents. Anger erupts occasionally into both the preface and "Song of Myself," where he is ironic at the expense of slave-catchers, 10 Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass: The First (i855) Edition, ed.

But, given the back- ground we have been examining, it is remarkable how serene Whitman is about the contentious political issues of his day, almost as if he deliberately reset his clock to a time when most of the country believed disunion an utter impossibility. "The union" he describes as "always surrounded by blatherers and always calm and impregnable" (p. 7). As to slavery, he put his faith in the inexorable unfolding of progressive historical laws. The American poet will therefore allow to enter into him both "slavery and the tremulous spreading of hands to protect it, and the stern opposition to it which shall never cease till it ceases or the speaking of tongues and the moving of lips cease" (p. 8). Whitman's reference to anti-slavery speech is but the final item in a long list of all that the American poet is to "enclose," including what were for him the primary bonds of Union, the geographical, natural, and human history of his vast land.1" Enclosing America, the poet unites its diversity in himself so that he comes to embody the Union. Like the Union, the poet makes an equal place in his poetic microcosm for all "strata" and "interests," for western and eastern, nothern and southern states (p. 14). And like the Union, too, the poet recognizes individual differences, beginning with those qualities distinguishing him from others, making him "a great master" (p. I5), "complete in himself" (p. 9), his soul, "president of itself always" (p. 14). As a new kind of egalitarian master, balancing "sympathy" and "pride" (p. 12), this poet has the conviction that he can perfect the work that the people of the United States started in their Constitution, namely, "to form a more perfect Union." II "Poetry situates itself," the poet-critic Allen Grossman has said, "where other instruments of mind find impossibility." 12 11 Whitman's bonds of Union are all included in Seward's speech of II March I850, as is his argument that inexorable historical laws will eliminate slavery (see Seward, I, 87). In an i855 letter to Seward, Whitman indicates their political affinity: "I too have at heart Freedom, and the amelioration of the people"; see The Correspondence, ed. Edwin H. Miller (New York: New York Univ. Press, I96I), I, 4I-42. 12 "The Poetics of Union in Whitman and Lincoln: An Inquiry toward the Rela-</page><page sequence="7">576 American Literature Where political rhetoric was failing to preserve the Union, poetry, Whitman saw, could attempt an alternative discourse of union based on the unity of a representative American self. With respect to such a unified self, the experience of his own body and soul, his land, its animals, people, occupations and history, the earth, its evolutionary past and cosmic future-all was to be portrayed as a vast seamless web, within which differences could be accommodated without dismembering the whole. But when we begin to take apart Whitman's style, we can see the seams. Two very different personal and verbal styles, as the warp and the woof of the carpet, are woven into his seemingly unified poetic practice. The one is based on connec- tion and inclusion, the other on disconnection and exclusion. I call them styles of union and disunion, diverging orientations to the relationship of self and world, which Whitman offers to reconcile the democratic paradox of the many individuals and States affirming their own separate identities under the banner of Union, e pluribus unum. In Whitman's style of union, the figure most closely asso- ciated with the speaker's political self-presentation is a serial synecdoche, a list of parts democratically representing a whole that includes them all.13 If we separate out the parts of one of Whitman's lists, they seem to stand on their own, as a Ken- tuckian, a Hoosier, a Badger, a Buckeye (Sec. i6).14 Yet, just as in classical synecdoche, the sail that stands for the ship cannot function apart from it, so too in Whitman's series, individuals (and their states) are dependent on the Union that gives them both individual and collective identity. Whitman spells this out in a line describing American Federalism. The speaker is, he says, "one of the great nations, the nation of many nations-the smallest the same and the largest the same." Having provided the allegorical key to his synecdochic catalogue, he goes on to tionship of Art and Policy," in The American Renaissance Reconsidered, ed. Walter Benn Michaels and Donald E. Pease, Selected Papers from the English Institutes, NS 9 (Balti- more: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, I985), p.

Cowley) will be referred to by their later section numbers.</page><page sequence="8">Union and Disunion in "Song of Myself" 577 counteract both sectionalism and nativism, two of the greatest dangers to the Union in the i850s. He is therefore "a southerner soon as a northerner," and "not merely of the New World but of Africa Europe or Asia," in short, a true American. As he ex- plains in the preface, in America "a bard is to be commensurate with a people" (p. 6). Another characteristic device in Whitman's style of union is what we might call redundant metonymy, a trope so nearly transparent that it hardly seems a deliberate figure. Where in classical metonymy an idea is evoked by the substitution of some closely associated term, Whitman generally supplies both the idea and the association, the occupation and the instrument or sign by which it is known.15 Instead of substituting a thing for a person, as in the classical metonymy of arms for soldier, Whitman multiplies the terms by which any one person is repre- sented. Thus, in the serial line, "The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor" (Sec. 8), the second and third terms could be metonymically substituted for the first term, but have been deliberately added on instead. By extending this principle across many lines, Whitman creates a realistic sense of physical inter- connections among the democratic mass. M. Thomas Wynn has suggested that Whitman's catalogues portray all workers as inde- pendent artisans rather than as employees in order to displace onto a few mercantile villains his anxiety about the widespread capitalization and consequent alienation of labor (pp. 79-82). I would add that redundant metonymy contributes directly to this compensatory project. Though Whitman cannot make the driver own his means of production, he makes him and every other worker poetically inseparable from the tools of his or her trade. Whitman uses metonymy figuratively (that is, substituting one term for another) to represent personal, especially erotic, union, 15 Classical definitions of metonymy include these distinct substitutions: cause for effect and vice versa, container for contained, possessor for possessed, sign for office or occupation, instrument for action, the physical for the moral, an adjunct of the subject for the subject itself. Discussions of Whitmanian metonymy have not noted the crucial difference in the poet's use of the figure: see D. S. Mirsky, "Walt Whitman: Poet of American Democracy," trans. B. G. Guerney, Dialectics: Critics Group, I(I937), 23-24, and C. Carroll Hollis, Language and Style in "Leaves of Grass" (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, I983), pp. I73-203, esp. pp. I77-78.</page><page sequence="9">578 American Literature which also has political implications for the poet. For instance, his depiction of the soul as a sexual body, "You settled your head athwart my hips and gently turned over upon me" (Sec. 5), uses the metonymy of the container (the body) for the contained (the soul). With his soul and body interpenetrating and becoming indistinguishable from one another, Whitman shows himself to be a non-hierarchical being. Later in the poem, in a moment of ecstatic union with the night and the ocean, Whitman character- izes these with erotic adjectives properly belonging to himself, using the metonymy of transferring an adjective from one sub- ject to a related one: "Press close barebosomed night" (Sec. 20); "You sea! . . . Dash me with amorous wet" (Sec. 22). Whit- man's metonyms, both redundant and figurative, always connect human beings to the material world they inhabit. These figures show a representative American self experiencing life as a union of each and all. In his style of disunion, by contrast, Whitman allows him- self to become disengaged from the vast union he has formed. He relies on the tension in metaphoric expressions that reveals the differences between tenor and vehicle as much as it suggests their similarities.16 His most characteristic figure of disunion is an extended personification-built up of similes, metaphors, and metonyms-in which an aspect of the world or of the self is evoked by animal or demonic, rather than by human imagery, thus opening a gap between the speaker and the personified agent (e.g., the sun in Section 24, his own sexuality in Sec- tion 28). As if to overcome this self-created sense of difference, Whitman interacts with his personifications, struggling with the metamorphosing figures for control of his identity. In these pow- erful, fictitious scenarios, transitive and intransitive dangerously switch places: orchestral music "throbs" and "sails" the speaker till he loses his hold on reality (Sec. 26); not he but "pruri- ent provokers" external to him are "straining the udder" of his "heart for its withheld drip" (Sec. 28). Rather than uniting self and world or integrating various aspects of the self, such fig- ures act, as Richard Chase has noted, "as a radical individualist 16 This view of metaphor is memorably described in Max Black, Models and Metaphors: Studies in Language and Philosophy (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, I962), pp. 25-47.</page><page sequence="10">Union and Disunion in "Song of Myself" 579 conceives society to act. They break down the self.""17 Unlike the synecdoches and metonyms that are spread throughout the poem, Whitman's metaphoric figures of disunion are concen- trated in a single sustained crisis section of the poem. They are best understood therefore in terms of the poem's overall plot, to which I now turn. III Whitman begins "Song of Myself" by establishing what I call a federated model of personal identity: self and world, soul and body, Whitman and his compatriots, shown as equal parts within a unified whole, which is at once political, religious, and cosmic. He goes on to dramatize a rupture in that federated identity, depicting his several faculties each insisting on their dis- tinctive separateness. Then Whitman represents their reintegra- tion. These three large movements in Whitman's poem-Union, Disunion, and Reunion-dramatize the crisis of the Union in I855. To Whitman's highly political sensibility, threats of seces- sion by the States showed democratic individualism grown to monstrous proportions, just as Federal enforcement of the Fugi- tive Slave Law showed national uniformity overcoming indi- vidual states' rights and becoming a tyranny. Whitman takes these dangers into his poem and represents them as crises of his own identity. In the phase of Disunion, we see the dis- memberment of an identity whose various parts refuse to work together as one. In the phase of Reunion, we witness the tyranny of an egalitarianism that swallows up all individual distinctions before learning to relinquish authoritarian control. The outcome of Whitman's poem was intended to show that it was possible to unify a highly stressed self and, by analogy, an increasingly divided country. The phase of Union opens with the poet inviting his soul to connect with the leaning body on the grass. He then goes on to attach himself to what lies around him through the permeable membrane of his identity. Such interpenetration of one's outside and inside is bivalent: it can either open the poet and poem to 17 Walt Whitman Reconsidered (New York: William Sloane, I955), p. 69.</page><page sequence="11">58o American Literature an idealized embrace of self and world, or it can dissolve a stable personal identity altogether, as happens later in the poem. At the start of his self-presentation, in Section 12, Whitman chooses to open the membrane, so as to integrate his body's activities with its environment:18 The smoke of my own breath, Echos, ripples, and buzzed whispers .... loveroot, silkthread, crotch and vine, My respiration and inspiration .... the beating of my heart .... the passing of blood and air through my lungs, The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and darkcolored sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn To define a self with permeable boundaries, Whitman needs an assemblage of images whose limits cannot be precisely de- fined: "echos, ripples, and buzzed whispers." The terms are metonyms, effects of unnamed causes. In naming only perceived effects, the speaker externalizes himself through his senses and internalizes what is sensed as part of the self. The poet cannot easily externalize his sexuality, however, which remains private, even in the boundariless world of Whitman's poetry. So he safely evokes the male genitals by substituting the genus "loveroot" for the species, penis, the material "silkthread" for the pants made of it, the container "crotch" for what it contains, and concludes with the nearby "vine," apparently begotten by the "loveroot." Whitman was wise to use such elliptical metonymies. His more overt treatment of phallic imagery in Section 24 (II. 532, 536, 538) provokes an undesirable self-consciousness, the dangers of which we shall note below. In the long first movement of the poem, Whitman's bodily awareness is integrated with non-physical aspects of his con- sciousness, most famously in the marriage of body and soul in Section 5. It is impossible for an observer of the scene to tell that one of the two bodies on the grass is anything other than body. Whitman avoids the traditional hierarchical dualism of 18 My commentary on Whitman's consciousness of the body has been informed especially by Michael Fried, "The Beholder in Courbet: His Early Self-Portraits and Their Place in His Art," Glyph, 4 (1978), 97-98; and Jean Starobinski, "The Inside and the Outside," Hudson Review, 28 (1975), 333-51.</page><page sequence="12">Union and Disunion in "Song of Myself" 58i body and soul in favor of a complementary notion of identity, the "I" remembering a moment when it felt itself to be an indi- visible "we." The "I" is thus represented as a federation of two equal selves, a sort of "We, the people" within a unified body. The poetic gain from this experience is represented in a list that spans the largest principles ("a kelson of the creation is love") and the smallest entities ("mossy scabs of the wormfence, and heaped stones, and elder and mullen and poke-weed"), which grow on the ground where the poet lies. From these specifically named grasses, it is a small step to the child's question, "What is the grass?," but a much larger one to Whitman's provisional answers. These offer the reader various hermeneutic techniques that unite the simple physical object, grass, with a range of abstract meanings, so that "the unseen is proved by the seen" (Sec. 3). The poet starts Sec- tion 6 with personal and impersonal allegory: the grass as the "flag" of his disposition or the emblem of a coy God's design- ing hand. Qualifying his anthropomorphism, he then suggests a contextual, almost literal reading of the grass as "the produced babe of the vegetation." Focusing on the grass as "a uniform hieroglyphic," Whitman's study of signs becomes a democratic homily, as he actualizes the meaning of the grass, "growing among black folks as among white," by his equal naming of the red, white, and black inhabitants of America. Seeing in the grass a traditional icon of mortality, "the beautiful uncut hair of graves," 19 the exegete transforms the image into its opposite: "The smallest sprout shows there is really no death." Its climac- tic placement and lengthy exposition show this to be Whitman's preferred interpretation. Why then did he tease us with his series of artificial guesses? Whitman's political ideal of Union required both liberty and equality, whose aesthetic equivalents were variety and unifor- mity. Uniformity is represented here by Whitman's democratic homily that the grass has a universal meaning. But in the interest 19 Gay W. Allen, The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman (New York: Macmillan, I955), p. I59, cites Homer as the source for Whitman's image; there are also numerous biblical uses of grass as a metaphor for mortality (e.g., Psalm 90:5-6; Isaiah 40:6-8; Matthew 6:30).</page><page sequence="13">582 American Literature of variety, he makes room for other possible views among his audience or within a pluralized democratic self. Only after pre- senting these other interpretations, does he present his preference for a spiritualized reading of physical matter. After these set-pieces on body-soul union and the varieties of union conceivable to a democratic interpreter, Whitman launches into the meat of his first phase: cataloging the world around him from his unified vantage point on the grass, merging himself in the unity of the seen and the unseen. This procedure con- tinues through the first half of the poem: he and every other self are depicted as being of a piece with the objects and activi- ties with which that self associates. The merging swells to an ecstatic crescendo in Section 24 (II. 530-44), where his sexual euphemisms elaborately conflate self and nature. In the next moment, however, begins the dismantling of Whitman's enlarged self, the second phase, Disunion, in his plot. In the clear light of dawn, the speaker reports a doubt-"I pause to consider if it really be"-followed by a growing unease, signalled by his alienating shift to a non-human personifica- tion: "Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs, / Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven." "Libidinous prongs" and "seas of bright juice" defamiliarize the sunrise, evoking a non- human world of myth and archetypal battle. Whitman identifies the sun's seeming coupling with the earth as a challenge to his own sexual potency. He further admits the precariousness of his boundariless self-definition: "how quick the sunrise would kill me .... " The hyperbolic language indicates how much is at stake in this encounter: if Whitman and the sun are not equal, then the egalitarian poetic universe he has so carefully built up crumbles. There can be no union of self and world, when each aggressively asserts its distinctive identity. Whitman dramatizes the destructiveness of such self-assertion in Sections 24-28. In these crisis sections, the poet's previously unified identity breaks into parts, each seceding in turn. He assumes successively the exclusive viewpoint of vision, speech, hearing, and touch, only to discover that his total identity begins to malfunction, leading to feelings of madness and suffocation, his figures for psychological and physical breakdown. Contem-</page><page sequence="14">Union and Disunion in "Song of Myself" 583 porary politicians, it is worth recalling, described those who would dismember the Union as "madmen" belonging "in an in- sane hospital."20 Whitman's seceding senses are similarly those of a madman imprisoned in subjectivity, a feeling the poet ex- presses through figures that disconnect and exclude him from his previously equalized world. The first sense to separate from the whole being is vision, threatened by the sun's visual brilliance. The poet seeks fig- ures of speech to reestablish himself as a master equal to the sun. Transferring modifiers appropriate to the sun ("dazzling and tremendous") to himself, he sends sunrise "out of me," so that the threatening external sunrise becomes a self-validating internal one: "We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun, / We found our own my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak" (Sec. 25). Whitman has switched from "I" to "we," it seems, as a defensive maneuver, reaffirming the pluralized unity of bodily self and soul at this moment of challenge to his iden- tity. Apostrophically, he calls upon "my soul" (clearer in the "O my soul" of later editions) to draw a boundary between himself and the threatening world around him. In a world of inequali- ties, the poet relies on a figure of poetic self-consciousness for self-protection.2" To restore his feeling of mastery, he turns to his all-encom- passing voice, but speech becomes the second faculty to secede from Whitman's federated self. Turning on the poet, speech says sarcastically, Walt, you understand enough .... Why don't you let it out then?" The poet's speech, his essential genius, refuses to be manipulated by one who, sun-like, would ascend above the democratic mass. Whitman wishes he could retreat into silence, though of course carrying out this Quakerish boast would put an end to his poem.22 Instead, he challenges speech to articulate what cannot be articulated, the sheer physicality of 20 Comments by Seward and Lewis Cass, quoted in Nagel, p. 268. 21 See Jonathan Culler, "Apostrophe," Diacritics, 7 (1977), 59-69. 22 As background to Whitman's ambivalent attitude to speech, see Richard Bauman, "Speaking in the Light: The Role of the Quaker Minister," in Explorations in the Ethnog- raphy of Speaking, ed.

Press, 1974), pp. 144-60.</page><page sequence="15">584 American Literature grass: "Do you not know how the buds beneath are folded?"23 By attempting this quid pro quo of privileging inarticulateness, Whitman ironically stumbles in speech, his agrammatical lan- guage mirroring his confusion about how to demarcate public from private identity: Waiting in gloom protected by frost, The dirt receding before my prophetical screams, I underlying causes to balance them at last, My knowledge my live parts .... it keeping tally with the meaning of things, Happiness .... which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day. What is the subject of this sentence? First, the grass, then him- self, then an ambiguous "it"-for none of these can he provide a predicate to complete an action. So he turns to the silent reader / listener, seeking from him or her some equivalent act in pursuit of the inalienable right of happiness. Only by bringing those who hear his message into harmony with the founding purposes of the Union can the poet justify the undemocratic role he has taken in separating himself from the democratic mass in order to speak for it. To become again a representative member of his society, a listener, Whitman turns to his sense of hearing. With the cata- logue of "I hear" statements in Section 26, Whitman abandons the alienating self-consciousness of his dialogue with speech fill- ing himself with the sounds of the natural and social worlds: "I hear the bravuras of birds .... the bustle of growing wheat .... gossip of flames .... clack of sticks cooking my meals." When he begins to listen to music, however, he is disconnected from his external environment and propelled inward: "I hear the trained soprano .... she convulses me like the climax of my love grip." The one simile gives rise to a crescendo of metaphors, and as Whitman interacts with the personified music, he expe- riences the polarities of his imagination-passing from "wider than Uranus flies .... to gulps of the farthest down horror." 23 I am indebted to Kerry Charles Larson, "Voices in the Grass: Whitman and the Conception of 'Free Growth,'" Centennial Review, 26 (I982), 203-04, for his explication of this image.</page><page sequence="16">Union and Disunion in "Song of Myself" 585 In these two kinds of hearing, Whitman offers a parable about both egalitarian and individualist models of identity. On the one hand, the shared, social experience, represented by the uninter- preted listening in the first half of the section, is overwhelmed by the greater vividness of private fantasy. Yet this private identity, discovered by Whitman in his erotic response to the opera, can- not survive the figurative ocean into which it has been plunged. In Whitman's imagined descent into self, his bodily identity is represented as being at risk. He is one moment pleasantly laved and licked, but in the next, his body is defaced and drugged, "cut by bitter and poisoned hail," "steeped amid honeyed mor- phine"; his windpipe is squeezed as if by the looped coil of a rope, the "fakes" (or also feigning) of death. If one's breath cannot circulate outside the body, life ends; analogously, anyone seceding into a private selfhood, without salutary interchange with the world, is consigned to a death-in-life. The explosion of figurative language in this section suggests the alienation Whitman experiences by withdrawing into his own finiteness. Too vulnerable to touch another person and to have to relate on another's terms, Whitman touches himself only to become absorbed again in private erotic fantasy. In Section 28, we witness his tragic isolation through an extended allegorical image, which shows him as both animal and human, alternately pitiable and condemnable. Pictured as a pastured animal alone on a headland, he is left defenseless by the other errant members of the herd, his fellow senses, against the incursions of "pruri- ent provokers" and a "red marauder," demonized images of his hands and penis during masturbation. Again, he uses tightness of breath to convey his feeling of entrapment: "my breath is tight in its throat; / Unclench your floodgates! you are too much for me." The outward thrust of ejaculation, however, offers the poet a safe, external vantage point for viewing the crisis he has just represented allegorically. His sperm becomes metaphoric rain, which produces real growth, and through these compensatory images of natural fecundity, he reconnects to a non-fictive world of his own imagining: "Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward. / Sprouts take and accumulate .... stand by the curb prolific and vital, / Landscapes projected masculine full-</page><page sequence="17">586 American Literature sized and golden" (Sec. 29).24 These lines conclude Whitman's representation of Disunion. In them, we see him relearning what he seemed to know at the start of the poem: that to establish an equalized identity with the world he has to turn consciousness into physical presence. The poet can speak of the soul, but only in connection with the equalizing bodily world. In extremity the poet had used the soul-term to differentiate himself from the sun, but henceforth, he must use it also as an equalizer. To do this he must anchor it again in the body. Commencing the third phase of the poem's plot, Reunion, Whitman embarks on a journey through space and time, taking in American places, people and the wars that founded and ex- panded the country, demonstrating, as in other catalogue se- quences, the myriad connections possible and necessary in a unified democratic land. During this journey, Whitman leaps not only to other historical moments but also beyond earth itself into space. His lived body, which can only exist at one point in space and time, is joined by his embodied soul: "I visit the orchards of God and look at the spheric product, / And look at quintillions ripened and look at quintillions green" (Sec. 33). In this leap, Whitman delights in presenting himself as a poet of the imagination, seeing orchards among the quintillions of stars, gaily incorporating ingestion, the aerial grace of birds, and the slipperiness of water into a composite metaphor for the imagining soul: "I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul." A few lines later, he anchors his "ship," and sends the messengers of his imagination off to report back to him. Such bird and ship metaphors for the soul could as easily be found in "Alastor" or "Prometheus Unbound."25 But such images, which traditionally privilege and disconnect the aspirations of the soul from those of the body, do not exhaust Whitman's presentation, which is also anchored in bodily metonyms for the soul. Whit- 24 Roy Harvey Pearce, The Continuity of American Poetry (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, I96I), p. 79, argues similarly that Whitman solves the mystery of being by reconceiving it as the mystery of creativity. 25 Suzanne Nalbantian, The Symbol of the Soul from Holderlin to Yeats: A Study in Metonymy (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1977), provides a useful compendium of nineteenth-century poetic figures for the soul, though she does not treat Whitman, who cannot fit her neat classification of later nineteenth-century poets preferring dark pessimistic images for the soul.</page><page sequence="18">Union and Disunion in "Song of Myself" 587 man s soul does not simply fly but, as a body, also swallows and swims. This soul does not sail in uncharted metaphoric waters, but rather is stationed by the poet in a very real Arctic sea, where nineteenth-century explorers, painters, and poems did venture. Whitman brings his body with him when he visits those realms to which only soul has traditionally had access. To be "the poet of the body" and "the poet of the soul" (Sec. 21), Whitman developed figures that could treat body and soul as identical wholes, as in the body-soul coupling of Section 5, and as parts of one whole, as in the body-soul journey of Section 33, which hovers between the difference-making of metaphor and the connection-making of metonymy. For when the body-soul no longer functions as a union of its different parts, but lets any one part separate from the others or dominate them, then the self can no longer function as a coherent entity, as he showed in the crisis of Sections 24-28. There is another parallel danger faced by Whitman's self, which he has yet to dramatize. Just as the Federal Union could abuse its power over states and individuals, so Whitman's re- united "I" can succumb to the temptation to swallow up every- thing outside the self and thereby erase the distinction between persons so necessary in a democratic society. It is one thing to keep open a membrane for interchange between self and others, but it is quite another to promote a tyrannical union and claim to be other selves. He is, he tells us, the suffering survivor of a shipwreck. "All this I swallow and it tastes good .... I like it well, and it becomes mine, / I am the man .... I suffered .... I was there." This totalitarian incorporation (figuratively, inges- tion) of the other, is followed by several more illocutionary acts of total identification: "I am the hounded slave .... I wince at the bite of the dogs"; "I am the mashed firearm with breast- bone broken"; "I am an old artillerist, and tell of some fort's bombardment .... and am there again" (Sec. 33). These synec- dochic statements of identity (the whole subsuming the parts) isolate the speaker in self-glorifying fantasy, just as much as the earlier metaphoric personifications mired him in self-destructive fantasy. In stating his identity with others through the construction "I am," Whitman was adopting a divine prerogative used by Christ</page><page sequence="19">588 American Literature in the Gospel of John and by Krishna in the Bhagavad Ghita.26 In these scriptures, each of them has an a priori right of uni- versal identification because he is thought to embody the com- plete divine presence. Though Whitman called himself "divine" earlier in the poem (Sec. 24, 1.526), in Section 38, he confronts the perplexities of his mortal nature. His images of the grave, paired antithetically with those of Christ's resurrection, show that whatever identity Whitman feels with the resurrected Christ is precisely a function of their shared mortality. While thinking of himself as a god bolsters Whitman's egalitarian refusal to be subservient to others, it also impedes his social intercourse with his fellows. Therefore, he changes his "I am" discourse after this point in the poem (see Sec. 47) to refer only to his wholly human role as teacher, preaching his faith in the united body and soul. Near the end of the poem, Whitman's chastened, reunited self claims that the essence of his experience "is not in any dictionary or utterance or symbol." Nevertheless, he proceeds to define that essence: "It is not chaos or death .... it is form and union and plan .... it is eternal life .... it is happiness" (Sec. 50). The opposition of chaos and death to form, union, plan, life and happiness could not be clearer. Nor is it an accident that the crucial word "union" comes together with "life" and "happiness" from the Declaration of Independence. Whitman saved "union" for this exegetical moment, for making plain the meanings of what Whitman calls in his preface the new, "indirect" American poetry (p. 8). The time had passed for Whitman to write another series of ineffectual editorials eulogizing the Union. What Whitman could do for the country, he ambitiously hoped, was to offer a book so governed by principles of natural and harmonious union, so aware of the alternative dangers of both secession and tyranny, that his readers would be persuaded of the analagous political benefits of the Constitutional Union for themselves. We know now that his contemporaries did not possess the literary 26 See John 6:35; 8:12; 9:5; lO:7, II; 11:25; 14:6; 15:I; and J. A. B.

We also know that even if his few readers had been able to decipher his political message, they were helpless to fend off the economic, social, and political forces leading to disunion and war. Whitman, of course, lacked our hindsight. Instead, he had faith and hope. And out of the extravagance of that hope, he created a poetic blueprint of an ideal America, so that his compatriots might yet retreat from disunion and constitute themselves, in all their conflicting diversity, as one nation.27 27 I am indebted to the American Council of Learned Societies and the Committee on Grants, Franklin and Marshall College, for funding a year's leave spent at Brandeis University, where a seminar and conversations with Prof. Allen Grossman and Claudia Yukman stimulated this work.
