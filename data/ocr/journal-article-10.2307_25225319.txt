<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOKCASE For such a small and well hidden organ, the pituitary gland is the victim of a remarkable number of diverse pathologies. The ancients believed that it secreted phlegm, which flowed through the cribriform plate into the nasopharynx. It was not until the 17th century that Richard Lower, an early fellow of the Royal Society, speculated that its function was to connect the brain with the circulation. Pituitary disorders (A F Krisht and G T Tindall, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, $165, ISBN 0 683 30143 8) is an old fashioned multiauthor text that provides a comprehensive account of the neurological and endocrine conditions associated with pituitary diseases. Autobiographies are rarely written by men who have received all the credit that they think they deserve. The Sceptical Witness (S Kind, Hodology, ?19.99, ISBN 0 9533987 0 6) is no exception. The author was a forensic scientist involved in many famous cases including that of the "Yorkshire ripper." He tells an engaging tale marred only by rather too frequent excursions into self justification. The myth of Pygmalion, who fell in love with the statue of a woman he had sculpted and had his prayers answered when the goddess Aphrodite brought her to life, symbolises the powerful emotions evoked by images of the human body. Philippe Comar explores our need to make and respond to depictions of our bodies in a short and entertaining visual essay (The Human Body: Image and Emotion, Thames and Hudson, ?6.95, ISBN 0 500 30093 3). He seems to touch on everything from ancient anthropomorphic idols to magnetic resonance imaging. It's brilliantly illustrated too. There are more high quality images in the second edition of Colour Guide? ENT (N D Stafford and R Youngs, Churchill Livingstone, ?11.95, ISBN 0443 06146 7) The text is brief and structured?ideal for medical students revising the subject in a hurry. It is widely known that antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, which induce hepatic microsomal enzymes can lead to failure of the combined oral contraceptive pill. But the implications of a diagnosis of epilepsy for women of childbearing age go far beyond this. In Women and Epilepsy (Martin Dunitz, ?9.95, ISBN 1 85317 644 3) Tim Betts and Pam Crawford consider how epilepsy can affect sexual development, the menstrual cycle, sexuality, pregnancy, labour, the puerperium, and the menopause. It's succinctly and clearly presented and will be useful to anyone who advises patients with epilepsy.
