<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bioclimatic Skyscrapers by Ken Yeang Artemis, 1994 144 pp., ?24.95 1-874056-56-0 Approaching Kuala Lumpur by plane, a dramatic tower stands out from its surroundings near the airport. This building, Menara Mesiniaga (1989-92), is immediately recognizable as Ken Yeang's creation. It is remarkable for so young an architect to be building on such a large scale and with such an identifiable style. But this reflects both the present rapid growth and vitality of the Far East, and the energy and ambition of the architect. Bioclimatic Skyscrapers unequivocally declares its intention to change our conception of appro? priate building forms for the tropics. There are two powerful pressures to introduce new building forms: the first is cultural, to assert the appro? priateness of the local vernacular tradition in an updated form, and the second is climatic, for the imported Western high-rise building is totally unsuited to a tropical climate. Although it could be argued that International Style modernism is ill-suited to more temperate zones as well, when transported to the tropics its fundamental design flaws become much more obvious. But how does one derive a new and appropriate architectural vocabulary? In Yeang's case there are several strands to the answer. He studied at the AA, where there is a continuing tradition of radical questioning and where international modernism had never been uncritically accepted. Later, at Cambridge University he investigated the theoretical framework for an ecologically ap? propriate architecture. Returning to Malaysia he researched the local vernacular and indigenous architecture, and published two respected books on Asian architecture. Yeang then produced a set of design principles concerned with the location of the core, the use of transitional spaces, solar orientation and shading, structural massing, and vertical landscaping, all of which are lucidly described in the present book. He then attempted to achieve a synthesis between the cultural aspir? ations of South-East Asia and the imperative of an ecologically sound architecture. However, this is not merely a theoretical exercise, for his struggle can be traced in the development of a series of heroic constructions.

He would like us to think that it entails a sys? tematic programme of research which is then tested by implementation. The reality is far more complex. Yeang employs a rough theoretical model which is continually modified and sophis? ticated as he chances upon or encourages work that is relevant to his evolving vision. Individual commissions serve as the inspiration to develop or alter aspects of this model. Referred to as the bioclimatic skyscraper, it is claimed as a new building type and an alternative to what the archi? tect describes as the 'ubiquitous cookie-cutter floorplate prismatic tall building now found throughout the major cities of the world'. Yeang avoids the problem of developing an architecture that is appropriate to the tropics. Instead he proposes a modified version of the Chicago / New York high-rise model, suitably adapted to climate and culture. This importation he justifies by analogy with the ubiquitous im? portation of the Boeing 747, and the conventional arguments about land values. This latter argument 110 begins to touch on the apparently contradictory pressures of the desire to be seen as international players and that of establishing a national iden? tity. In his introductory essay Alan Balfour al? ludes to this tension in detecting a body language in the work which reflects the struggles with this cultural and climatic discontinuity. He describes the towers as 'armoured figures preparing for an as-yet-undefined task, somewhat uneasy with their ecological responsibility'. Following the introductory essays by Yeang, Balfour and Ivor Richards, there are descriptions of some twenty-four of the architect's projects from 1981 to 1993, some executed, others still on the drawing board. Compared with the earlier work illustrated in a previous monograph by Robert Powell,1 this is a rich and prolific period. The projects are illustrated and described in a conventional manner, using a standard page layout, often with a conceptual diagram or sketch, a solar diagram (to which I will return), and a small photograph in the top right corner, betraying an A A 1960s pedigree in the use of reference material which has anthropomorphic connotations, a preponderance of fashion shots, and aeroplanes. A number of dominant concepts and themes emerge. The integration of vegetation and vertical gardens ? 'planting en escalier' ? in the IBM Plaza, Menara Boustead, Menara Mesiniaga and the Tokyo-Nara Tower. The use of transitional indoor/outdoor spaces ? 'sky-courts' ? in the Plaza atriums and the BP Tower amongst others. The strong influence of solar geometry on the building's geometry is claimed for the Budaya Tower, the Central Plaza and the Orchid Tower. New themes in current projects include the use of wind energy in the series of China Tower de? signs. The exciting concept of an interactive wall, where parts move and adjust to seasonal changes and even daily or hourly changes in the climate or in response to the changing require? ments of the occupants, has not yet found full expression in built form. These projects have enormous promise and it would be unreasonable to expect them to fulfil their own expectations. Most of the bioclimatic features have to be seen as symbols rather than achievements of their own agenda. It is too easy to fault these buildings within their own terms of reference, yet in the end that is what they them? selves will have to do in order to overcome competition from the West. At the RIBA's annual conference of 1972, 'Designing for Survival', I gave a talk which em? phasized the need for a responsible approach to energy and materials, and incorporated some of Yeang's earliest ideas on the subject.2 My pre? sentation evoked a genuine interest, but overall the conference was a depressing affair, as it became obvious that it was the survival of the profession, not of the planet, which preoccupied most of the delegates. Ironically, if architects had seized the initiative at that time and formu? lated a comprehensive energy policy for build? ings, they might have ensured a future role for the profession. Instead, in a parody of impotence, they wasted their chance with a iong-life, loose fit, low-energy' campaign motivated more by politics than by a serious attempt to address the issue. The ethical arguments for an ecologically sound architecture are being gradually re? inforced by a more powerful economic imper? ative. In selling his ideas to his clients, Yeang uses a mixture of arguments including regional identity, corporate prestige and image, better working-conditions and, perhaps most persuas? ively, the argument that buildings that are more economic to run are more environmentally responsible, which will become more important as the economic consequences of using scarce, non-renewable resources become more serious, and the need to demonstrate a responsible cor? porate attitude becomes more significant to the public image of a company. Yeang is now in exactly the right place at the right time and he has the right preoccupations AA FILES 28</page><page sequence="3">and connections to take advantage of this trend. But there are plenty of architects in the West who are also anxious to develop new architectural forms and to work in Asia. In this context Richard Rogers's Tomigaya Tower project and Norman Foster's Commerzbank are quoted by Ivor Richards in his introductory essay. It is therefore vital that Yeang get his technology absolutely right before he falls foul of criticism based on his own criteria. This is where I think there is a danger in this book. While acting as a powerful vehicle to promote Yeang's ideas and emerging architectural concepts, it reveals weaknesses in the ability of the office team to put these ideas into practice. For example, as men? tioned above, many of the project pages display solar diagrams superimposed on building plans. The intention is clearly to indicate the care with which they have taken into account the path of the sun, but unfortunately the diagrams are once again no more than symbolic of such concerns, and there is virtually no correlation between the implied sun-path and the fenestration. There are also photographs showing solar shades with patches of sunlight on the windows they are supposed to be shading. But then Yeang is in the distinguished company of James Stirling and Le Corbusier, amongst others, whose books of projects have the same problem of discrepancies between photographs and conceptual diagrams.3 Yeang now has the necessary computer tools to produce such diagrams accurately, for he generously invited my AA Diploma School students to visit his office in Kuala Lumpur and to help with solar geometry problems.4 When Yeang was at Cambridge writing his doctoral thesis under my supervision, he had the luxury of three years' full-time study to produce a thesis of considerable significance.5 Now, with the pressures of running an expanding international office, he urgently needs to find staff who can take on the responsibility of giving these matters the careful attention they require. The overall impression of this book is of a prodigious output of exciting projects, by an energetic, talented and committed young archi? tect. They hold great promise for the future of architecture in this dynamic area, and a lesson for the whole world. The projects are not yet fully resolved, but if the momentum of this effort can be maintained Yeang may yet bring off the reality of his claims to having invented a theory of bioclimatic architecture that is as relevant to our climate as it is to the tropics.
