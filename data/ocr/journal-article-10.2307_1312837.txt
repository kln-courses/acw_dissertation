A Peter Davison Book (Houghton Mifflin), New York, 1995. 278 pp. $21.95 (ISBN 0-395- 71816-3 cloth). For rock musicians, the surest sign of achievement-the proof that an artist has established himself in the popular consciousness-is, as the old song goes, to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone. For most scientists, the surest sign of achieve- ment is to appear in the "Science Times" section of The New York Times-probably the most widely read, widely respected mainstream source of information on late-break- ing developments at the forefront of science, developments of sufficient import to be deemed interesting to the paper's umpteen million read- ers. It is icing on the cake for that fortunate scientist if the article in The New York Times happens to be written by Natalie Angier. An extraordinarily effective sci- ence writer, Angier is renowned, among scientists at least, for the breadth of her interests, the accu- racy of her reporting, and the clarity of her prose. Any scientist who in- teracts regularly with the media knows the horrors of misattribu- tion, distortion, or omission that often accompany news stories; these horrors are not a problem with An- gier, who has consistently been ac- curate, thorough, and objective in her reportage. It is not just her sub- jects who appreciate her talents- Angier's many accolades include the Pulitzer Prize, the American Asso- ciation for the Advancement of Sci- ence Journalism Award, and the Lewis Thomas Award. Not everybody is able (or even wants) to read The New York Times, so we are fortunate that Angier has put together a wide-ranging collec- tion of essays, based largely on her writings for the paper. The Beauty of the Beastly covers the full gamut of contemporary biology-out to the fringes and back. Angier's own in- terest in the beastly subjects that some may consider repulsive stems, by her own account, from her child- hood. She grew up in the Bronx, where, as a resident of what she calls a "proto-slummy apartment," she acquired a pathological fear of cockroaches. She once spent an en- tire night cringing under the bed- covers in fear of a crayon that she had mistaken in the dark room for a six-legged object of dread. She over- came her childhood fears, and as is April 1996 297</page><page sequence="2">so often true of the converted she is now an enthusiastic admirer of what others might find threatening and strange. Angier now writes about cockroaches and their spiritual kin- "the golems and creeps and ogres of the world...the bloodsuckers, the lowlifes, and the brutes." However, in the interests of equal time, she exposes the beastliness of the seem- ingly beautiful-"the sins of the anointed saints, the Jekylls beneath the hides," the unseemly behavior of some of nature's most endearing creatures. Thus, she exposes cheat- ing chickadees, lazy bees, un-Flip- per-like dolphins cavorting like "sailors at Tailhook," and a variety of other stereotype-busting crea- tures. The essays are organized into seven sections-Loving (insights into sex and reproduction), Dancing (es- says about molecular processes), Slithering (the facts on ostensibly noisome creatures), Adapting (be- havioral biology and conservation issues), Healing (matters relating to human physiology), Creating (biog- raphies of scientists and artists), and Dying (the end of life, as it affects cells, tissues, organs, and close rela- tives). In general, the groupings are logical, and essays within each sec- tion complement each other nicely. Angier's writing is enormously entertaining; she makes no apolo- gies for anthropomorphism and uses analogies, stories, figures of speech, and wonderful word play to explain a breathtaking range of phenom- ena. She has a gift for finding the exact turn of phrase to convey a complex idea-her gorgeous analo- gies instantly clarify and illuminate at the same time as they entertain. The collection has just the right touch of humor-I laughed out loud in places (a healthy reaction; as An- gier points out on page 196, "sus- tained hilarity is among the more agreeable forms of aerobics"). For example, in describing the structure of a cell, Angier marvels how effi- ciently three-foot-long strands of DNA are packed into a space only a hundred-thousandth of an inch across-"too tiny to qualify even as a Manhattan closet" (p. 60). Refer- ences to popular culture abound- scorpions are so nasty, for example, they "make the Borgias look like the Brady Brunch." Scientists in all disciplines can learn from this book; I was fasci- nated in particular to discover the etymological origins of many of the terms that are the stock in trade of molecular biologists (the myc gene, which encodes a protein that is criti- cal in determining cell fate, comes from myeloma in chickens; its part- ner gene, max, owes its name to its alliterative attractiveness and not to its experimental origin). In fact, Angier's journalistic gifts are show- cased to greatest effect when they are applied to the generally inacces- sible arena of molecular biology. Never has this field had such an engaging expositor; remarkably, she is also fluent in the language of ecology and evolutionary biology (more often the subject of popular science books). If there is any cause for a carp (more of a minnow, actu- ally), it is that, in many cases, not enough information is provided to allow a curious reader access to the primary literature. Even a short bib- liography would have been invalu- able. Although the writing in this book is excellent throughout, it is most effective, and most affecting, when it is at its most personal. The unex- pected death of a friend from undi- agnosed AIDS, and Angier's grand- mother's slow and terrifying decline into senility, are more than just fram- ing devices for essays about disease and death-they are in themselves deeply moving and profoundly memorable stories. That is a good thing in a book of essays about biol- ogy. After all, biology is one field of science that is universally acknowl- edged to be most directly relevant to people's everyday lives-it is liter- ally the "science of life." Animal mating behavior is fascinating be- cause of the insights it offers into our own romantic habits; pro- grammed cell death in the thoracic muscles of a hornworm moth is of interest because it is eerily similar to the death of cells in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Angier convincingly and unapolo- getically argues for the merits of anthropomorphism and even in- cludes an essay on an ongoing dis- cussion of its merits in scientific circles. Although there is certainly a need among people to feel special- after all, the notion that the earth is ours is peculiarly human-this per- spective serves to highlight the com- monalities among species, "what we share with the other inhabitants of the planet." Understanding these commonalities is the surest and fast- est route to understanding these (other) inhabitants as well as re- specting and appreciating them- even if they happen to have a few more legs than would seem digni- fied.

William K. Smith and Tho- mas M. Hinckley, eds. Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1995. 396 pp., illus. $74.95 (ISBN 0-12- 652870-5 cloth). As the world's oldest (up to 5000 years for bristlecone pine) and larg- est (up to 300-feet tall) living things, conifers are unique objects for bio- logical studies. Their enormous im- portance lies not only in providing useful wood products, but also in maintaining biodiversity and sus- tainability of forest ecosystems. The nine chapters in this book clearly lay out the differences be- tween conifers and broadleaved trees. The basic rationale for this book is that, because conifer forests differ from broadleaf deciduous for- ests in leaf, canopy, and structural characteristics (e.g., leaf longevity, leaf litterfall, nitrogen content, rate of litter decomposition, soil nitro- gen availability, and nitrogen up- take rate), the methodologies devel- oped for studying the ecophysiology of broadleaved trees often are un- suitable for conifers. Several unique features influence the capacity of conifers to harvest light: a deep canopy and small needles, creating a penumbral ef- fect, and the clustering of needles, which creates a discontinuous dis- tribution of needle area.
