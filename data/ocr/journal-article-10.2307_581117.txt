<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 INTRODUCTION As I finish compiling my second number of 'A in G', I feel that I am really back in Greece. It has certainly been a fascinating (as well as onerous) task to try to keep track of developments. My work has been encouraged by friendly comments on my first number and helped by the willingness of colleagues to provide reports on recent discoveries, which, I believe, greatly enrich the account. As usual the report covers mainly work of two different periods: the year covered by the latest Deltion Chronika (vol. 47), in this case 1992; and work of 1997, based on the reports which have been kindly sent to me, and on the Ergon of the AS for 1997. The Praktika of the AS for 1994 have appeared; AR 1994-95 had covered the excavations concerned on the basis of the shorter reports in the Ergon for 1994 (one omission, Vasilike lerapetras, is made good this year). For Macedonia and Thrace, AEMTH is a rich source. This is particularly true of Volume 10 for 1996 which has appeared fast thanks to funding from the Cultural Capital of Europe Organisation 'Thessalonike 97'; we still await Volumes 8-9. For Crete Kritiki Estia 5 (for 1994-96) appeared too late to be exploited last year; this has now been made good.This spring the Ministry of Culture for the first time produced a report on its work in 1997: 'The Work of the Ministry of Culture in the Sphere of Cultural Heritage'. It came too late to be excerpted for this report (except for the numismatic appendix); if it appears again next year, and in time for our deadline, we shall try to include it. Other sources used are referred to under the site. For the Deltion Chronika, references to the current volume are given by page number if possible, and without the volume number; references to earlier volumes include the volume number. Use of press reports has been restricted; a file of press cuttings is available in the BSA library. My work on these sources has been greatly facilitated by the contributions of a number of Members and Students of the School resident in Greece: Lesley Beaumont (Northeast Aegean Islands); Jill Carington Smith (prehistoric to Roman northern Greece), Colin Macdonald (Crete), Iphigenia Tournavitou (prehistoric to Roman central and southern Greece) and David Turner (Byzantine Greece, except Crete). Penny Wilson prepared the list of new publications. Yana Spence, Eleni Hatzaki and Anne Blackman helped with translations, Helen Fields with editing and sequencing the text and Vicki Tzavara with typing. Lin Foxhall kindly advised on oil and wine pressing terminology. I am most grateful to all of them. Last year I was not able to use at the last minute valuable numismatic notes provided by Nicholas Hardwick and Julian Baker; this has been rectified this year. The addition of a numismatic appendix is an experiment on which we should welcome comments. One of my aims last year was to increase the number of illustrations. Fulfilment of this aim was helped last year by the support of the editor of AR, Lyn Rodley, by the fact that that issue contained no other archaeological report, and above all by the positive response of many colleagues in providing photo- graphs and plans. I offer a rich selection of illustrations again this year (the detailed acknowledgement will be found at the end of the article), in the hope of continued generosity by the Hellenic Society. For an explanation of the types of field work carried out in Greece and their forms of publication, and the other sources of information on which the compiler of 'Archaeology in Greece' can and must draw, I can do no better than refer the reader again to the masterly introduction by Hector Catling to his last contribution (AR 1988-89, 3-8). The economic development of the country and the many infrastructure projects continue to provide a daily challenge to our colleagues in the Greek Archaeological Service. The press continues to highlight discoveries and controversies. The decision to change the course of the Metro Line 3 tunnel to avoid the Kerameikos cemetery was applauded on all sides, though attention was drawn to the cost of premature construc- tion of a Metro station which will now not be used. A new Archaeological Law has been prepared, and a draft discussed with interested parties; an all-day debate was held with members of the Archaeological Service, and representatives of universities and foreign schools of archaeology; a draft has been discussed in Cabinet and now goes to Parliament. Last, but not least, the controversy over the Parthenon 'marbles' continues. The British School at Athens does not represent the British Government, and it (and I) do not comment. The unification of archaeological sites in central Athens (a long- standing proposal) is now on the active agenda, as is a new interest in neo-Classical architecture. It is somewhat invidious to select notable exhibitions, but one stands out: the 'Treasures of Mount Athos' at the Museum of Byzantine Culture in Thessaloniki. The exhibition ended on 30 April, 1998, after having been extended for four months. Undoubtedly the most successful and well-attended exhibition in the history of modem Greece, The Treasures of Mount Athos-accompanied by a lavish and highly accomplished catalogue of some 700 pages-will be remembered for years to come. Despite the throng of visitors, totalling over 700,000, the new Museum of Byzantine Culture coped extremely well. The new Museum's permanent exhibitions, currently limited to EByz ecclesiastical architecture and burial practices, have been highly praised in both the Greek and foreign press. Indeed, the permanent exhibit 'From the Elysian Fields to the Christian Paradise' (organised under the supervision of E. Kourkoutidou- Nikolaidou) was part of the Pan-European 'Transformation of the Roman World' series of exhibitions, organised under the auspices of the European Science Foundation. A superb catalogue of all the exhibitions along with introductory essays was published by the British Museum under the same title (eds. L. Webster and M. Brown, 1997). Displayed in this exhibition are recently discovered chamber tombs with depictions of Old and New Testament scenes. Dating to the 3rd -5th Ct, they are exceptionally important for the history of ECh art, and are in the process of being fully published. From 1994, the Museum of Byzantine Culture also publishes a journal (Museum of Byzantine Culture) in Greek, English and French. Pausing briefly in Athens on their way back to the monas- tery of St. Catherine in Sinai, nine icons and one precious manuscript were displayed at the newly renovated premises of the Benaki Museum in August-September 1997. An exhibition of Armenian ecclesiastical treasures (metal work, wood work, manuscripts, vestments, coins, etc.) was held from April to June 1998 in the Megaron Mousikis in Athens. This large and impressive exhibition was one of the first to visit Europe from Armenian churches and museums, and was accompanied by a detailed catalogue. The exhibition 'Portraits of the Fayum' has been seen in Herakleion and Athens. Exhibitions of Iberian antiquities have been held at the National Archaeological Museum and the Goulandri Museum in connection with the Spanish royal visit. The finds from the Great Tumulus at Vergina have been</page><page sequence="2">2 DAVID BLACKMAN moved from Thessaloniki Museum, and are now displayed at Vergina in the building which covers the tombs. A new exhibition, 'The Gold of Macedon', opened in Thessaloniki Museum in June 1998, in the hall formerly occupied by the Vergina finds. It has four sections: gold in the ancient world, the use of gold, technology, and gold in the cemeteries of Macedon in the 6th-2nd Cts BC. Many finds from recent as well as older excavations are displayed. The Austrian Archaeological Institute celebrated its centen- ary and the Swedish Institute its 50th birthday. Both marked the occasion with conferences. So many conferences have been held that it is impossible to list them, but one noteworthy development is that the model provided by the annual confer- ence of archaeologists of Macedonia and Thrace is now being widely followed by regional conferences elsewhere. Also, I personally cannot forbear to mention a very successful sympo- sium on post-404 Athenian inscriptions which decided to start work on a new edition of them, following in the footsteps of Lillian Jeffery and David Lewis' Inscriptiones Graecae 13. It is a sad but necessary obligation to record the deaths of notable figures in Greek archaeology: Barbara Philippakis, Manolis Hatzidakis, Tony Hackens, George Forrest, and recently Vronwy Hankey and Cressida Ridley.

No report for 1992 was submitted to ADelt 47 by the 1st Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate. Agora. The work of the ASCS in 1992 (ADelt 17-20) was already reported in AR 1992-93, 5-6 (T. Leslie Shear, Jr.). John McK. Camp, II reports on the 1997 season of excavation: "As always, the excavations produced material covering a wide chronological span, from the earliest IA to the beginnings of the HL period. The early material was particularly abundant, from the period when Athens was taking form as a polis or city-state. Excavations were carried out in two separate areas: under the middle stoa in the agora square and just N of the NW entrance to the agora. In the central area, E of the S boundary stone, we continued to explore the levels deep under the middle stoa. The earliest deposits directly over bedrock filled a shallow gully and supported a road which runs northeastward into the area of the later agora square. Pottery in this layer, though fragmentary, included some fine pieces of early bf ware (Fig. 1). The material comes down to the middle years of the 6th Ct and the ..............

Fig. 3 apparently deliberate grading of the area may represent the earliest laying-out of the public square at that time. In one pocket in the bedrock we recovered several pieces of pottery of the very latest 8th Ct BC which presumably came from a disturbed grave. Most impressive is the large jar used for the actual burial, standing three feet high, decorated with stripes on the body and G motifs on the neck (Fig. 2). Also to be dated to the 8th Ct was a shallow well, only 1.30m deep as pre- served. Pairs of hand-holes cut in the sides suggest that more ambitious plans for a deeper well were abandoned. Several two-handled cups (skyphoi) and a small bowl made in imitation of a basket (Fig. 3) were thrown in as the shaft was filled up, and indicate that the abortive well dates to the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC. In the NW area (Fig. 4) we continued to scrape bedrock deep within the foundations of the Augustan temple of Aphrodite. Here we discovered a second burial, immediately S of the one cleared last season. It was a simple stone-lined pit cut into the ground, containing the remains of a teenage girl. Unlike her neighbour, she was buried with some modest grave goods, a bronze pin, a bronze ring, and two small jugs. These allow us to date the grave to the years around 1050 BC, and thus represent the earliest evidence we have for human use of this area N of the Eridanos river. Our earliest evidence for actual habitation N of the river was also encountered this year, in the form of a well dating to the years around 800 BC. It was cut through sterile soil and bedrock to a depth of 7m. Pottery from the period-of-use included banded water jars, glazed pitchers decorated with bands of G designs, and coarse ware jugs (Fig. 5). The next major phase recovered in this season's work was the LA period, which was found at a relatively high level behind the C commercial building. Here we dug more of a thin layer of crushed bedrock fill which was partially excavated last season and found to be full of ostraka cast against Themisto- kles and Xanthippos. Another 50 or so were found this year, bringing the total up to over 120 pieces, making it one of the largest such deposits from the agora. Almost certainly these represent cast-offs from the ostracism of 485/4 BC, when Xanthippos was exiled and Themistokles became leader of the popular party. Just to the E was found a shallow pit, into which an assortment of fragmentary bg fragmnents had been discarded. The pit is only 0.75m deep and 0.80m in diameter and its function is uncertain. Nearby we encountered two cobbled surfaces, very hard-packed and showing signs of foot traffic. Only a small area was exposed this season, so it is not yet clear whether we are dealing with a road or some sort of courtyard open to the sky in use in the years around the time of the Persian invasion of 480/479 BC. We continued to excavate also within the C commercial building, concentrating on the two southernmost rooms. Here, we stripped off successive floors: level, smooth, surfaces of hard-packed clay. Several dated to the EHL period. From one of them we recovered an impression taken in clay from a piece of metalwork with relief decoration (Fig. 6). The original showed a draped lady moving to her left, looking back to her right, with her right arm held up and bent, holding more drapery. A wreath of sketchy, elongated leaves runs across the area above her head, just below the rim of the piece. The top of the impression suggests it was taken from an open vessel, with a slightly out-turned rim, some 0.18m in diameter. The right side, beyond the upraised arm, is also a finished surface, indicating that impressions were made of individual figures. This piece reinforces our notion that the C commercial building was the site of the manufacture and sale of high-quality miniature works or art. From a lower floor in room 2 we also have another 'pyre', as they are called-collections of small pots and areas of burning-which seem to reflect some rite not known from any literary source (Fig. 7). The new one is among the earliest known, dating to the very early 4th Ct BC, and is the sixth 'pyre' to be recovered from the building. The architecture of the building itself is coming into sharper focus as a result of the work this summer. The exterior S wall is carefully built of large ashlar blocks of poros limestone. The interior walls are of hard acropolis limestone, set in a polygonal style with 'ladders' of smaller stones filling the interstices. This wall style</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 5 1 ..-15_ /'rI 6 C ASSICAL C DMMERCIAI, BUILDIN 7 and AJACENT STRUCTU S at NORTHERN OUNDARY of the AG RA AGORA' EXCAVATIONS AT ENS 8 1234 6 7 8 9 1)m 9 R ' ,CA 2/96 1 380.00mN. 20 3 10 W WELL SK2:4 20 13 : Y ICA LASSICAL" 16 ov o 1920 123 67 I 1 13 1 1 6 1 1G A 3 Fig. 4</page><page sequence="6">6 DAVID BLACKMAN . . . . . . . . .

Fig. 5 is common in Attica in the 5th Ct BC, and pottery from the lowest floors suggests that the building should be dated to the middle years of the century. There are slight differences in the construction of the various walls and it is not yet clear whether any chronological distinction is to be made in these stylistic differences. The other major development of the summer concerns future work in the area. Demolition of a recently-acquired property was begun, our first expansion into new territory since 1992. The new plot, just over 250m2 in area, will occupy our efforts for the next several years. It should cover part of a LR bath, the early northern road, and the N end of the C commer- cial building. It will also allow us to connect the antiquities which were uncovered in rescue excavations in the adjacent lot to the W in 1960.

Athens city: the Metro. In 1992, work was begun on the construction of the Metropolitan underground railway network of Athens. The Archaeological Service, in cooperation with the technical company in charge of the project, made extensive provisions for the safety and preservation of the anc. remains. It was stipulated that all tunnels are to be located below the archaeological levels, while stations and air-shafts are to be ideally positioned at a safe distance from known archaeological sites, especially sections of the anc. fortification system. All work is to be conducted under the close supervision of the Archaeological Service, after all the necessary investigations are completed. Specific stations that are unavoidably located in the vicinity of major archaeological sites, like Kerameikos, Monasteraki, Makriyanne, Syntagma Square, the Academy, and the Olympeion, are to be excavated with extreme care before any construction work can begin. (ADelt 21-2) Syntagma Square (Fig. 8). The most important features excavated in the E half of the square included part of the known C cemetery in the area, and a section of a LA drain- pipe. Part of a stone-built rectangular peribolos wall (A), dating from the end of the 5th/4th Ct BC, and including five tombs (four sarcophagi, one tile-roofed tomb), was excavated in the SE sector. Two further stone-built funerary periboloi, dating from the 5th Ct BC to ER times, were investigated in the vicinity. The periboloi included a total of eight tombs (two stone sarcophagi, four tile-roofed tombs, two pit graves). To their N was located part of a drainpipe, 5m long, considered to be part of the 'Peisistrateian' water supply system. In the NE section of the area was revealed part of a hydraulic system, consisting of a bell-shaped cistern and two drainage pipes, all coated with water- Fig. 6</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 7 Fig. 7 AEO 0O POE I AMAAIA IE L, o 0 w Z L_ 0 0 o w 4q o o 4 0 s . 10 0 3 .1 Fig. 8 proof plaster and dated to the R period (3rd Ct AD). (ADelt 22-3) Other excavations in the city centre: Opposite the Larisa train station were discovered four sections of a clay drainpipe of HL date (4th-3rd Ct BC), which were possibly related to a network of C pipes unearthed at Odos V. Hugo. (ADelt 33, 20) Parts of R walls, two storage areas, and pipes, dating from the 1st Ct BC to the 3rd Ct AD, were excavated at Odos Metro- poleos 23, and Odos Hypereidou 8. At Odos Tziraion 8-10, excavations revealed a network of 15 walls, forming six domestic spaces, belonging to two different building phases, both dated in the l lth-12th Ct AD. A number of marble architectural and sculptural members (head of girl, millstone, threshold, column drum, etc.) and an inscribed base of R date, which were found in the fill above the remains, explain the total lack of stratification and confirm the suspicion that the area was thoroughly disturbed in later times.

(Figs. 9-10 ADelt 26) Work for the mod. drainage system in the same area revealed a large section of the S branch of the C fortifications, as well as parts of walls and sections of R buildings, which suggest both an intensive building activity after the time of Hadrian, and the extension of the anc. city towards the S (Fig. 10). The exterior face of the fortification wall, which was traced for a considerable distance and which turns towards the NW under Odos Parthenonos 12 (ADelt 22, 106), was pre- served to a maximum height of 2m and a width of 1.20m. It consisted of a built peribolos in polygonal masonry, with a pile of clay and small stones. The preserved top surface of the fortification coincides with the original height of the stone foundation of the wall, which was originally completed with a mudbrick superstructure. The thickening of the wall at the E end seems to have been an original feature and was probably part of a construction providing access to the ramparts or to a tower. This section of the wall, judging only by the building materials and the masonry style, can be dated to the start of the 4th Ct BC (i.e. the period of Conon: 394 BC), while alterations in the HL period suggest the continued use of the core of the wall at this time. A section of the same 4th-Ct BC fortification system has been investigated at Odos Misaraliotou and at Odos Veikou (PAE 1950, 68-71; ADelt 31, 27). (ADelt 26-9) Part of an elongated cistern, lined with waterproof plaster and dated to the 4th Ct BC, was located at the junction of Odos Kallisthenous 54 and Tritonos 12, while at Odos Aga- memnonos 6, were excavated a cist tomb of the 2nd Ct BC and an anc. wall. From the fill were recovered, among other finds, a small bronze mirror and an inscribed cylindrical funerary stele (ITINEHP/HPAKAEUTHR). A LG pyre was discovered at Odos Neleos 32-38, with a section of a pipe to its N, constructed from parts of a stone sarcophagus and the neck of a clay amphora. Both can be associated with the G tombs and the 4th-Ct BC architectural remains excavated in the vicinity. (ADelt 20, 44-47; 22, 79-83) At Odos Megalou Alexandrou, and to the E of anc. remains, which include parts of two walls, a marble funerary lekythos, and a clay drainpipe, was located part of the anc. road leading from the Dipylon to the Academy, as well as a small section of its SW retaining wall. Four out of the five preserved road surfaces date to the C period. (ADelt 29-31) During the excavations E of the archaeological park at the site of Plato's Academy were discovered sections of an anc. road used from the EC to the HL period, and two parallel walls of HL date, 12m apart, which probably served as the retaining walls of the road. On its uppermost surface, which was stone- paved, was discovered an inscribed funerary column of ER date; the road continues southwards. A landscaping study for the archaeological park was begun. (ADelt 31) Demosion Sema. Charis Stoupa (3rd Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities) reports on the excavation at Salaminos St in January-July 1997: "Rescue excavations at Salaminos 35, in the vicinity of the archaeological site of Kerameikos, to the NW of the Dipylon Gate, brought to light, apart from some remains of individual burials, four anc. rectangular cuttings, at a depth of 2.20m below the road surface (Fig. 11). These cuttings, 1.70-2.90m in depth, contained the remains of a complex of at least three poros, subterranean funerary structures of the theke type, with a particularly narrow longitudinal plan and isodomic walls, two courses high, and skilfully built with monumental blocks. The structures (internal width: 0.90-1.10m; height: 1.10-1.25m), covered by slabs, were set on a slab pavement. The blocks and a number of the slabs, preserve traces of both toolmarks and anathyrosis. All the structures were destroyed in the R period, after which many of their constituent parts were removed, to be reused as building material. The first of the two longitudinal, almost parallel structures, discovered in the interior of the first cutting, was excavated for a length of 9.85m; construction details suggest that it was either originally divided into at least two areas (internal length: 3.75m and over 4.75m respectively), or there were two or more similar, but separate structures. The length of the second structure, with a similar internal division, was at least 10.30m.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 9 MEE mmods""? ......... :?7::::: opt ii:? j?:: &amp;::: . . . . . . . . . -.1: Q" : F . . . .. .1::Ij-?;:: OVA~iii AWW::: No-?? 1"' it- W i-:::::::::::: A,-- Ni~iiiiiii~ilil iii'ii :?: 4 rMUMN, W.: 040-: gnu% W :::::::: Fig. 11 At the point where the corners of the first and second cuttings met, at the NE corner of the plot, and along the extension of the first structure, was revealed part of a third (length: 1.75m), similar to the other two, and perpendicular to them. Its floor and interior wall surfaces bear traces of white plaster. The existence of a fourth, destroyed structure in the second cutting, is indicated by the impressions left on the slabs of its partly destroyed pavement. Remains of two further such structures were discovered, the one at the edge of the second cutting, opposite the third structure, the other in the third cutting. The bottom of the first two cuttings, which are perpendicular the one to the other, and where the majority of the finds were made, was already cut into platforms of different heights, before being paved. At the lowest level extends the uniform pavement, right angled in shape, of the second and of the suggested fourth structure. The pavements of the third and the first structures, the latter provided with a more regular paving, are respectively 20cm and 30cm higher than that of the second structure. Finally, in the fourth cutting, a tomb was unearthed, the sides of which were lined with mud brick walls (height: 2.15m; width: 0.48m). On the floor of the cutting was laid a poros block with a circular socket for a bronze kalpe. Judging by the sheer length of the N wall of the tomb (4.60m), and by the remains of a dividing wall inside it, it seems that it included originally more than one dead. In both the fill and the destruction layer in the interior of the first structure, were collected fragments of burnt bones, belonging to at least three male skeletons, while in the destroyed section of the second structure a shallow rock-cut apothekes was located below the floor, containing a great number of sherds and funerary vases dating from the first and second quarters of the 5th Ct BC; these were probably the contents of tombs destroyed during the initial digging of the cuttings. In the preserved section of the same structure was identified a layer with burnt bones and funerary offerings (vases), dating from the third quarter of the 5th Ct BC, the only such group found in situ in the interior of the funeral monuments. On the floor of the third structure were found many burnt bones belonging to at least one male skeleton, as well as bronze fragments from a kalpe, while in the fifth structure were identified many fragments of burnt bones, belonging to the disturbed remains of at least two male skeletons. In the disturbed layers of all the cuttings, the pottery collected was of excellent quality, and some of the pieces can be attributed to circles of known painters of the C period (the Achilles Painter, the Tymbos Painter, the Kleophon Painter). The close proximity of the plot to the anc. road leading from the Dipylon Gate to the Academy, the E retaining wall of which has been discovered in the neighbouring plot to the W, places it within the boundaries of the Demosion Sema, the state cemetery of the anc. city, which had developed on either side</page><page sequence="10">10 DAVID BLACKMAN TURM M TM I-T IT17-I T i M TT-I T FT IITTTIT1 I IiT E RIDANOS M M M I-LILI- I HliUl I IlL ULIIIILI II II I I I I LULU UULLLU M U~l UUJ 5.50 u 44.43 (.17 ~~~~ A-rJ NICHT AUSGE GRA13EN 1 (?

Until now, though many sections of the road had been located, none of its important funerary monuments had been discovered, with the exception of the few examples within the archaeological site of Kerameikos. According to the anc. sources, and especially the description of Pausanias (I 29, 2-16), it included the tombs of the founders of the Athenian democracy, those of certain orators, philosophers as well as generals and a particularly large number of polyandreia (communal tombs) of those fallen in battle, so that the Demos- ion Sema had the appearance of a military cemetery. On the whole, the location of these structures within the Demosion Sema, their subterranean character, their morphol- ogical affinities to the theke-type tombs, and the fact that both their plan and their whole construction bear no resemblance to any other type of building, suggest that they must have been funerary monuments. The quantity of the extant pottery (especially rf, and white ground lekythoi, with battle and funerary scenes) and the great number of burnt bones from skeletons of well-built men, confirm the identification of these funerary structures as polyandreia. Unburnt pottery offerings, suggesting that they were made after the burning of the bodies, may thus indicate the transfer of the bones from far away battlefields. At the same time, the division of the excavated part of the first monument into at least two areas might be related to the custom of burial by tribes, as Thucydides reports (II 34, 1-7), describing the burial of the first casualties of the Peloponnesian war.

The DAI reports on work in 1997: "Within the Sacred Gate, part of the Eridanos wall was cleaned and drawn. Two parallel channels crossing the Sacred Street inside this city gate and originally bringing fresh water from the Eridanos to the outer Kerameikos were also cleaned and drawn (Fig. 12). During this work some rf fragments and fragments of a strainer were found (Figs. 13-15); the latter might indicate the date of channel 'fg', since it seems to belong to the foundation trench (excavation should prove this). The upper half of the vessel is formed from a Megarian bowl mould. Parallels point to a date in the LHL period. A find from the last season in the Sacred Gate in December 1995 is a small- scale female marble head (H:6.2cm) of the LHL period (Fig. 16). Just next to the entrance from Psaromilingou Street a cut made by Willemsen in 1965 was cleaned and drawn, showing the gradually overbuilt street levels in front of the Dipylon. / N i N 5I \\ / \ \/ \ \/ O 1 2 3 t. 5cm 3antutr 4198 O~Cecn Fig. 14 0 1 2 3 4 5cm J anuar Act G-ejmer Fig. 15</page><page sequence="12">12 DAVID BLACKMAN : :: : ::: :::::::::::iciiiiiii;:iiiiiili:E;iili::i :i - . -:ii: ii - ? .- -- -::i:i::i- i :i-:.::.i:i i::::l::::: ::::::::::::: :::: .;i~---iiil?:-j-' :-:-.-.::i?:?i::i:i-i-iiiiii:--:_::: :::.::i?::-i ::_:i::?i?::?:::::-:::::i ::::\i:ii:?ii: :?:?:?'::':~ir:?i: :: :_?___:~__:::::iii:iji:ii-:i:i:-li:i- ::?::j-::iii:i:iiiiiiia;::iiii;i-i .: .--. i i-i:i;-i-i?i:i:: i-i::iilii:i-:;i.i:iiiiiii?;iid.';:.~:t :-:i ::::: .: ::i:;:: ::: ::-i:--:_::i::::_:-i::i:-_i:i' : ~-: - i :i::: :: :-;i:ji-iii'~i?i _i::-8--': :-:? ::?;::::?::: i:?:i-:-;- -:: :--::iii:i-ii.i-iiiii isri:"?~"''''': ':::*::': -'--':'::':-: :ir-----ii i --:::::::~ i'-:iiis-;;::i:::6:::-::ii-(-ii-- ~i:i;:-,--~ &amp;~::--:-:: a-:iilii:ii:iiiiiiiiiii::iiii:i:iiii:. : i:i:i-::_::::;-:.::::: .:.: .:. : .--.. ii:ii-iiiii:~:i;ii iiil iiiisii.i;i'ii:i-iii~i:: ::::::?-i:i~?-~ :~:: ::-::::rl::: :"- -r_:::::::;_:::::::';')' ,:::::::i -:: :::::I:i:: ai:i ::?i_:iiiiii:iiilC : :: ' : ::-::: : : --:':i:i:i?'-':i:: ?ii:i iii:i:i::: ::~:~:i8i--:i"l"i:: -:-::--I--'~?:- : : ::-: i-:i i' 'i89i:.~::::*::ii:':i r-ii?:: ::::i::-:::i::i:::i:i:: ::a -I -i:i:i iili'iii.: - i?i:ii :i : iii:: ?:~qg~l ?::: : : ?:?::: ?:,:? ??:i :::::i,:?~t:~; -:ii;j-i?ii::i~i?a:: iii i -:i .:.'-: ::- ..:.:;. ?:-~ i.ii:-:i-i-:-i:i .. - :-: -:.::?:.: i-i: ::::? :-::- ----:_-:.-:c_:-i::?:-:--lil::r'l--: ?:.: : : ::- - : -::---:_::_:_::_:.::li-i-l:i i:i-i C:- :iii??,i:ii-i-:_--i:j-:::-:::-::::;::i:::: ''''--'':-'-?----i''i':-_::?_;'_::i~:ii: :'::::::':::::-::: :,:i-:,::::::::i--;~.::'r::-::i: _:--::i:-::_::--::-:-::--:-:-i:i;:::---i ::i:j:: :::g::i:,::i::: . .;::i__iliii::- i: : :-:::::::j:::::::?:::.

The Museum contributed in 1992 to three big exhibitions abroad: an exhibition at Madrid, entitled 'The Mycenaean World', organised by Dr K. Demakopoulou, an exhibition at Brussels, entitled 'Le Sport dans la Grbce antique'; and an exhibition at the Washington National Gallery, entitled 'The Greek Miracle. Classical Sculpture from the Dawn of Democracy. The 5th century BC'. Among the numerous conservation projects under way at the Museum, the laboratories completed the chemical analysis of 74 bronze PR objects, as well as the X-raying of the Artemision bronze, for restoration purposes, with the co-operation of the Demokritos Research Centre. Rearrangements in the existing galleries include the uniform exhibition of the pedimental compositions from the Asklepios temple at Epidaurus (Room 22) and that of the pottery collection on the first floor. Twenty-five new pieces of sculpture were added to the collection and work was begun on the re-exhibition of the R sculptures. (ADelt 1-7) ATTICA Agrileza (Lavreotiki). Excavation at Agrileza, restarted in 1995, was resumed in late 1997 in a short season directed by Dr E. Kakavoyiannis of the 2nd Attic Ephorate and J. Ellis Jones (BSA), who reports: "Attention focussed on compound B, which lies on the S flank of Mt Michaeli, with the modern trackway obliquely crossing its S edge. The compound is a nearly square enclo- sure, measuring ca 30m E-W by 28m N-S (Fig. 17). The main aim was to reveal more of its internal plan. From its ore- washery in the NW corner (uncovered in 1995),- a range of (at least) four rooms of uniform NS depth but of different widths, extended to the NE corner, the furthermost retaining traces of fine plaster on two of its sides. A section across the room nearest the washery revealed deep, well-built wall socles on the S, bare of any plaster, and an earth floor laid over rock; the depth suggested that this, and other rooms of the N range, had been terraced into the hillside, and so an entry on this side was unlikely.

A section across the SW corner room, cut down to the rock, showed how the three embedded ore- crushing blocks were propped in place by means of stones packed under their irregular sides (Fig. 18); one was of limestone, two were of ochreous iron-stained sideropetra, and all three slightly hollowed from hard use. Another section midway along the E edge of the compound uncovered part of a water-channel, partly plaster-lined, extending out to the edge of the nearest of two round cisterns lying to the E, both now mostly overgrown with bushes. The N wall of the compound continued E behind this cistern I, further emphasising the link between them. All trenches were back-filled, and the floors and channels of washery B covered with a protective layer of earth, retained by a low wall built across its eroded open S end (Fig. 19). In the first week Dr Photos-Jones and Mr Johnson completed the EDM survey started by them in April 1997. Finds from compound B included 'Laconian' roof-tile fragments, a small amount of scrappy pottery of 4th-Ct BC type, and a British penny of Edward VII, dated 1905. The most</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 13 4mr |4 Fig. 19 interesting find of all was a bg ram's-head rhyton, found in fragments but largely restorable (Fig. 20), which had clearly been deposited whole in the angle of two walls in the S part of the compound (just under the N edge of the modern trackway). This material, stored in Laurion museum, was cleaned, classified, catalogued and drawn in November 1997 and April- May 1998." Eleusis. Nine rescue excavations, which provided evidence for anc. roads, buildings and cemeteries, were reported in 1992. (ADelt 32-42, with map) At the junction of Odos Pindou and Kolokotrone, during work for the construction of a new school building, part of the E retaining wall of the road leading from the anc. town of Eleusis to the N part of the Thriasian plain and on to Boiotia was excavated. The wall, which consisted of two architectural phases, was built of local stone, in polygonal masonry. The road, traced for a distance of 300m and reaching a width of 4.50m, preserved five successive surfaces of sand mixed with pebbles, as well as clear traces of wheelmarks, which suggests a busy thoroughfare; it dates to the LC period. A possible roadside cemetery E of the retaining wall has been proposed, on the strength of the evidence from groups of graves dis- covered along its S side (ADelt 44, 27ff). It seems that part of a dense network of roads connected Eleusis, not only with other Attic demes, but with the rest of Greece as well. Part of another anc. road was excavated at the junction of Odos Persephones 17 and Chatzidake, running E-W, with a surface of sand and gravel. N of the road were investigated tile-roofed tombs arranged perpendicularly to it, and to their E, the S part of a roadside building. To the S of the road, the entire area is crisscrossed by a network of walls, forming rectangular rooms of many successive building phases, includ- ing a small room with a mosaic floor and marble-veneered walls, four cisterns lined with waterproof plaster, two clay drain pipes with inverted 1I sections and a hoard of 130 bronze coins in a small unpainted pot. The uppermost layers date to the LR period. At Odos Pangalou part of a relatively narrow C road (w: 2.80m) leading to the sea (N-S) was discovered, as well as its two retaining walls. Six successive road surfaces of sand and gravel or small stones were identified, while the second surface from the top bore traces of wheelmarks. A clay drainpipe, postdating the road, ran along its central axis. In the lower levels A pottery was recorded, including a bf krater (mid-6th Ct BC) with a Dionysiac scene (satyrs, sphinx, wild animal). ?r r? r?, 'Y: r 1 I/r/ : ": %?,L~I rl,? -t ::??.' . ?r? .. t ?) \ciL.u, ~C!1 ?r I ~ 'Y -: " '.'.'

Travlos' theory that there was a shrine of Triptolemos in the vicinity (ADelt 22, 127-130). Displaced blocks discovered at the junction of Odos Byronos and Pindou, 80m N of the archaeological site, belonged originally to a retaining wall, with evidence for two building phases and various repairs, which was probably intended as protection against flooding. The wall, already located in the vicinity, cannot be associated with any datable finds. At Odos Demetros 64, 1km N of the archaeological site, the remains of the R aqueduct were excavated, as well as two C pipes, already located along the E side of the mod. road (ADelt 38, 30; 42, 28-30; 43, 46-47; 45, 53-54). At Odos Chatzidake, 300m from the N slopes of the acropolis, excava- tions confirmed the use of the area from LMyc to LC times. The PR levels included no architectural remains, only domestic pottery and part of a clay floor; two intramural burials without offerings in the SW part of the plot, were also probably LMyc. The EIA remains consisted of PG-LG pottery, clay figurines, part of a wall with a clay floor to its W, two tombs of the LG period, and at a slightly higher level, a triangular foundation, of probably public/ritual use, dated to the end-8th Ct BC/start- 7th Ct BC. In the same plot were also discovered EA archi- tectural remains (7th Ct BC), parts of four walls, a clay floor, a C well and a series of shallow pits with traces of fire, suggesting the existence of a workshop in the vicinity. Part of a R bath-house of impressive size was located at the junction of Odos Pangalou and Kimonos, the one apsidal end of which was preserved above the mod. road (PAE 1890; ADelt 16, 60-64). In the same plot was excavated part of the N wing of a large peristyle court of Hadrianic times. At Odos Kougi- oumtzoglou 85, 45m from the N side of the acropolis, outside the anc. settlement, and at the N limits of the LA-EHL cemetery, the core of which extended to the SW, was excavated a total of 18 tombs, including 11 cremations in rectangular pits, three pot burials, four stone sarcophagi and one child burial in a pit; the burials were haphazardly placed. One of the earlier sarcophagi was dated by its pottery to 470 BC, while another marble specimen, the richest tomb in the cemetery, contained a bronze helmet, two bronze vessels (ladle, kantharos), an iron tool and</page><page sequence="14">14 DAVID BLACKMAN 40%::i-i: NO:: :::j Fig. 21 :~~:~:'di"i:?:":":::::':-::! :ilii :i:ci? :i'iiiiBZ-i4flil~:-:--~---:--:~-j- ; ~~~8~ i:_iiaci?nlii''':'ii: -?iii i ~:-:::::::~s:- -:~ :;'_~:::::_:i:: :::::::: -?--:i:-:?:i:i,_i:_iiii-i:i I ?is-????::; ::::-::: :::::-:::: r::::: ~jii iii.-~i:i~i~;~?~,~'i''liiiiiiii .:c -:- Fig. 22 two alabaster alabastra of the 4th Ct BC. Finally, at Odos Souliou, part of a R-LR cemetery was dis- covered, overlying HL burials. The 17 tombs investigated included six R built tombs, sarcophagi, a rectangular built construction, three pot burials, five tile-roofed tombs, two pyres and one pit. Two walls marked the limits of the cemetery. Marathon. An unlooted cist tomb of MG date, with a pebble floor, was excavated at Balaria, the only remains of this date in the general area, while two parallel walls and the remains of a pyre were located at the foot of Mt Agriliki. (ADelt 57) Marathon-Tsepi. Prof. Maria Pantelidou-Gopha reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (19-22) on the re-excavation of the known PR cemetery, first excavated by Marinatos in 1970-72, which resulted in the discovery of new and more detailed information concerning the site. The tombs were all cists, dressed on the interior with smoothed local stones or slabs. The narrow entrance (0.40m wide), always located on the SE side, above the floor surface, was usually blocked with a slab (Fig. 21). The tombs were roofed with one or more slabs and then covered with earth, ca 0.50m thick. The position of each grave was marked by a rectangular peribolos wall, which enclosed the perimeter of the actual tomb, and which was built directly on the earth fill; a bigger trapezoidal peribolos outlined a wider space, which probably represented the property of the particular burial (Fig. 22). Among these family plots were scattered child A z .... .. 7E _' ...... . ... : L.____ I ZTIAnQNOE T 0 M H A- Fig. 23 burials. The larger tombs included more than ten skeletons each, of both sexes and of various age groups. The construction of the individual tombs (herringbone masonry) dates the cemetery to the EH period. The funerary offerings were few (ECyc I-II). Megara. In 1992, rescue excavations were conducted at a total of 16 sites in Megara. These produced evidence for parts of buildings, sections of the anc. fortification walls, and parts of cemeteries. (ADelt 42-54, with map) Remains of buildings of the C period include parts of two cellars at Odos Eupalinou and at the junction of Lykourgou and Mykenon respectively, while the remains of a building and part of a drain were located at Odos Siphnidion 12. Parts of two rooms of a 4th-Ct BC house, already identified in a neighbour- ing plot (ADelt 33, 38), were excavated at Odos Salaminos 37, while a rock-cut, pear-shaped cistern (d: 7m), parts of two parallel walls of a 4th-Ct BC building and a section of an earlier stone drain, leading to a circular cistern to the E of the building, were discovered at the junction of Menidiate and Metaxa. At Odos Mykenon a LR workshop was excavated overlying part of a HL building, only the foundations of which were preserved (Fig. 23). In one of the excavated areas (A), part of the floor of a small cistern, laid with river stones over a layer of waterproof plaster, sloped down to the NW, towards a small hollow for the collection of water, while two small basins were located along the E wall. In another excavated area (I), two pithoi were identified in the vicinity of two stone-built cisterns lined with rectangular mud-bricks, while two other areas (KA, A) were apparently used as water reservoirs. Finally, parts of two EByz bathhouses were investigated at Odos Schina 14. The preserved remains include the brick foundations of the heating installation, four rectangular brick pillars forming three openings for the circulation of the hot air, a thin brick pipe and an oval stone-built cistern supplying the</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 15 _ I / ..;j~i::" Fig. 24 water for the bathhouses. A section of the 4th-Ct BC fortifications of the town was excavated at Odos lapidos (Fig. 24). The space between the two faces of the walls, only two courses of which were preserved above the base, was filled with rubble. A small part of a rampart was also preserved 13.55m to the E. Both it and the walls were pierced by a large stone-built open drain, 13m long, and 66cm high. At a later date, when the walls were in ruins, a rectangular building, which was apparently related to the LR/EByz workshop located outside the C fortifications at this point, was erected between the walls and the rampart. A total of 33 tombs, the majority consisting of stone sarcophagi, six cists and two tile roofed graves, were dis- covered at Odos Salaminos 37, in the course of work for the water supply system of the mod. town. Their date ranges from the first half of the 5th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct BC. Three more burials of the 5th Ct BC, all sarcophagi, were found at Odos Phoroneos and Minoas 66, respectively. Two further parts of a known cemetery were excavated at Odos Argyrokastrou and at Odos 28 Oktobriou 217, including 20 tombs, the vast majority of which consisted of stone sarcophagi. Their date ranged from the 6th Ct BC (cists, pits), to the LHL period. A corner of a LA funerary peribolos, including three stone sarcophagi, was discovered at Odos Eupalinou, while part of another cemetery, inside the area enclosed by the long walls, was excavated at Parodos Platonos. It consisted of 15 tombs (five sarcophagi, seven cists, three pithos burials), dating from the M and LHL period. In the same area was identified part of a wall from a funerary peribolos, with a reused marble funerary stele bearing a relief scene of two standing males (APIETO- KPITOD/APIETONIAOY/AOHNAIOE). Nea Makri. Underwater investigation off the N site before marina construction found no anc. remains. (ADelt 694) Rhamnous. B. Petrakos reports on the 1997 season in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (11-18): "The architectural remains were excavated of the military camp used by the garrison stationed at the fort of Rhamnous; this was located at the highest point of the fort, on flat ground and was surrounded by a separate fortification wall.

Most of the excavated rooms were used as dormi- tories (the beds must have been of wood), while the few rooms provided with stone thresholds were probably used by the commanders or as storerooms for precious materials/supplies. The houses were constructed of mud-brick, with a stone base, and had plain earth floors; conditions were fairly primitive. Wells provided both drinking water and the water used in the elementary bathing installation discovered in the area. The date for the construction of the large rectangular S tower, as indicated by the earlier circular building incorporated in its lower part (1st half of 5th Ct BC), has been put in the mid-5th Ct BC, a date that marks the completion of the fortification works on the site, which had been in use from the 6th Ct BC (inscriptions, literary sources). The existence of this fort was due to the strategic needs of Athenians from the 6th</page><page sequence="16">16 DAVID BLACKMAN ............ . . . . . . . . . . ........... ......... .. .. .. ..

Within the camp were further unearthed the remains of the military headquarters dating from imperial R times, as well as earlier HL buildings and installations for the'storage of grain and the preparation of food. Inside the central building was discovered a perirrhanterion, probably part of a shrine to an unknown deity, and an intact stele, inscribed with an honorific decree by the mercenaries of the garrison to the orpaorly6; tr1; ntapacta; (general of the coast) Euxitheos. who held this office least four times, the latest in 175 BC, and must have been an important person: EJt0feo thogEvt5ot KrlTt- atta (188/187 BC). Salamis. Excavations at the site of the new school building at Ambelakia, to the W of the funerary peribolos and road discovered in 1988 (ADelt 43, 75-78), produced a considerable number of tombs, including four cists, five stone sarcophagi, one tile-roofed grave, one child burial and one pyre, all dated to the last two quarters of the 5th Ct BC. The remains of the fortification system surrounding the historical town of Salamis were investigated in the area of Cape Pounta, including sections of the walls and the remains of three towers to the SW and W of the church of Koimesis. The walls were constructed in the pseudo-isodomic style, with a mud-brick superstructure in the irregular isodomic manner. (ADelt 57-61) Cave of Euripides. During the period 1994 to 1997, Yannos G. Lolos (University of loannina), in cooperation with the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology, con- ducted a systematic excavation, with surface survey of the surrounding area, at the site of the historic cave near the bay of Peristeria located at the S tip of Salamis, directly opposite the island of Aegina and ancient Troezen. He reports: "This cave, judging by the ancient literary sources (Philo- choros, Satyros, the Anonymous Biographer of Euripides and Aulus Gellius, Roman author of the 2nd Ct AD) and one inscribed find of crucial importance (1996 campaign), can be identified with the famous retreat of Euripides at Salamis, where he used to withdraw and write his dramatic plays. The coastal location of the cave at Peristeria, in combination with its shape and general atmosphere, agrees, as no other site on the island, with the descriptions of the cave of Euripides in the above-mentioned ancient sources. The cave at Peristeria was visited (and pottery sherds were collected from the interior) by D. I. Pallas (1924), Sylvia Benton (1932), W. Phelps (1966) and I. Dekoulakou (1979). The narrow entrance to the cave, which is not visible from the shore, is located on the steep side of a rocky height above the bay of Peristeria, at ca 100m above sea level. From the natural platform of the cave's entrance there is a magnificent view of the Saronic Gulf. The cave has a maximum length of 47m and consists of ten areas; the interior appears labyrinthine, consisting of relatively low chambers, very narrow corridors (tunnels), niches, recesses and 'attic-like' spaces. The ceiling and the main walls of the cave are of a grey limestone, whereas in the interior there are solid of stalactite curtains and small individual stalagmite columns. During the four excavation campaigns the accumulated soil deposits were explored in depth (throughout the interior of the cave), down to the natural stalagmite floor, in addition to the relatively shallow deposit on the platform at the cave's entrance. The deposit in the interior of the cave is nowhere more than 1.70m deep. It was considerably disturbed both in antiquity and during more recent, even very recent illegal excavations. The recovered finds, however, highlight the diverse uses of the cave during five different periods of Greek prehistory and history: LN, LMyc, C, R, and Frankish periods (early 14th Ct AD). During LN (ca 5300-4500 BC) the cave was used for seasonal habitation and diverse activities; a wealth of objects were found in all parts of the cave, including: ca 3500 pot- sherds of different categories, hundreds of stone tools, 16 arrow points in excellent condition, quantities of seashells, jewellery made out of shell, bone and stone, one complete silver ring- shaped pendant of the known 'European' or 'international' type (4th-3rd millennium BC) and the upper half of a female idol in white marble with traces of red decoration. During the LMyc period (ca 1400-1200 BC), the large chamber (chamber 8) was used as a burial ground. The use of the cave for burials is documented by the discovery of numer- ous small finds together with the poor remains of disturbed burials. Among the Myc finds from the cave is a wealth of potsherds from small decorated vases, a short bronze sword, a pair of bronze tweezers, steatite beads and buttons, necklace beads of faience and other materials, a rockcrystal bead (or amulet) of high workmanship. A relatively small group of fine bf and other Attic vases date to the C period (late 5th/ early 4th Ct BC); these were recovered exclusively in the area between the entrance to the main part of the cave and the independent and easily accessible chamber 4F. These finds suggest that the cave was only occasionally used during this period. Among the late 5th-Ct BC vases the following are of special interest: a rf lekythos depicting a flying Nike (Fig. 26) and a small bg skyphos, with an inscription bearing the partly preserved name of Euripides. The name is written according to the version with two -I, incised on the exterior of the vase (Fig. 27). The inscription is of a dedicatory or commemorative nature and must be dated to the R period (2nd-3rd Ct AD). It seems that during this period the cave, clearly known from the local tradition, had become a place of pilgrimage in honour of the great tragic poet (cf. Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, XV.20.5).</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 17 ...:: ::i:iiiii-::i~i:.li-:::i:iil i ;.::i:i:i?:?:?:?:?:l:?:::: :?:'-':- -?iji~ ::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::: - -~-j::~?l~y~---~or::::::::::::::: ilii:F i'i:i'i'ifi~ii:iiiiiii-iiiii:i(:iii:ii :ii::i-i -::: -: i. ?:?:?:?~ :: : :::::?:::::-:-:-: 'ii Fig. 27 Similar heroic cults for Archilochos at Paros, Sophokles in Athens, Aristotle at Stageira and Homer in Smyrna have been confirmed by literary and archaeological evidence. The systematic use of the cave at Peristeria for cult activ- ities during the R period (2nd-3rd Ct AD) is confirmed by numerous ceramic and other finds, which were found in all parts of the cave. They reveal the regular and dense flow of worshippers at the site, which fits into the general scenario of 'cultural' and 'religious tourism' in the period. Prominent among the cult objects are the fragments of lamps, small open- shaped vessels, clay figurines and dedicatory plaques, an elaborate relief skyphos depicting scenes from the open-air cult of Dionysos-Bacchus (Fig. 28), glass necklace beads of various shapes, silver earrings, bronze, iron and glass rings, together with several dozen coins (Imperial Athenian in bronze, and other bronze, silver or silver-plated coins of Roman Emperors of the 3rd Ct AD). A hoard consisting of 39 silver-plated coins of Gallienus (260-268 AD) and his wife Salonina, were found in the very narrow blind corridor-space 4A. This hoard of coins, possibly the 'treasury' of the sacred cave, could have been hidden just before or during the great raid of the Heruli and the Goths against Athens and the S Greek coasts (267 AD). To this event we may attribute the decline or destruction of the cult cave of Salamis. Almost a thousand years later, and again during a period of danger and threat, during the Frankish period, the historic cave of Peristeria seems to have been used as a hideout and as a hiding-place for fortunes, as becomes evident from the pres- ence of two fragmentary and much scattered hoards. These consist of 38 tornesia (of a copper and silver alloy), jewellery (one silver and three gold-plated earrings, one bronze and one silver ring), an iron point and other small finds of metal, in chambers 6 and 8. These objects have direct or close parallels among published finds from Med Corinth. The practice of hiding tornesia and jewellery marks the last dramatic event in the history of the cave and was probably the result of pirate raids on the island during the early 14th Ct AD, certainly not later than during the reign of loannis of Gravina (1318-1333 AD), which resulted in the abduction and captivity of at least 500 inhabitants of Salamis (cf. W. Miller, The Latins in the Levant: A History of Frankish Greece [1204-1566], London 1908, 267)." ?i:ilr:j:liliii~ii -::Emma, IWO:::: -, WOi 0.0 Fig. 28 Skala Oropou. A. Mazarakes-Ainian reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (24-34) on the 1997 season, which resulted not only in the extension of the area excavated in 1996 (see AR 1996-97, 14-17), but also in the clarification of the use of a considerable number of architectural features. Of the buildings enclosed within the large rectangular peribolos wall, the ellipsoidal buildings E, I, IB, IE and the circular building IA date from the 8th Ct and pre-date the peribolos. The latter, together with the circular buildings IT and IF, the ellipsoi- dal building IA and building 0, can be dated to 700 BC. To a later date can be assigned, the rectangular space Z, as well as the rectangular anteroom to O. Even later, around the middle of the 7th Ct BC, is dated the last modification to 0, which again becomes ellipsoidal, as well as the circular building H. To the W of the peribolos, inside apsidal building A, were found pieces of charcoal with SG sherds in hollows dug in the floor, while building E, judging by the slag discovered on its earlier pebble floor, was probably originally used as a work- shop. The neighboring building IT had apparently some kind of religious function, indicated by its contents (bronze buckle, clay figurine, faience scarab). It seems that this building, and building Z next to it, communicated; in the latter was dis- covered a clay basin/sieve, full of the remains of sea food. Building H was found full of ashes and burnt olive stones, while in its N part was excavated a semicircular hearth of mud-brick, surrounded by scattered fragments of clay, which belonged to a destroyed pottery kiln, which used the olive- stones as fuel. Another pottery kiln, IA, was excavated to the N of IA, and contained ashes, pieces of burnt mud-brick and sherds from LG and EPA craters. The smaller circular building IF, to the W of IA, was not another pottery kiln, since it lacked traces of burning, but its original function is still uncertain. Broken vases of the EA period, charcoal and burnt animal bones found earlier to the W, should be probably associated with a built, table-like structure, which was possibly used for ancestor worship. In the same context should be viewed another long stone structure, in the centre of which had been set an upright worked stone, resembl- ing a funeral stele; among the finds was a clay boat, which suggests that this was the cenotaph of a man who died at sea. The chthonic character of the finds is supported by the discovery of clay horse figurines, outside the rectangular</page><page sequence="18">18 DAVID BLACKMAN ::: ::: ::: .... ....... :: :': :- : . ........................ ::: :. : iiii il-::-- -':::: :.: :: . ::::::::::::::: : i- ............ ........ . . . ----iiiiiiiiiii! ....-:-:-:-::--:: iiiii ? ................................. .... -- - _ii~iiiiiiiiSi.:ii :: : _ - --i: iiii . : ii ii ..... .. .. . :- .. .. . ..... .... . -- '''''~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii:::'" ::-:-'---i':':': i'- :: i i-i- iiiiii- iii'iiiii iiiii-li .......:::_ :::i:_ ::_ _ _ _::i ..... ...:---:-''iii~ ~li~- liiiiiiii-:--:--:--:-: iic:-'l-llii ? ..................... ........ . .... .... . . . . ....................................... . c-... . . . . . . . . . . . ~ R~~-: :i........_ ii............. ..... .................................................... iS!ii?iil iaiaiiiaii!!iPiiiii~iiiiiiiiiiiiijiii i ii:' ::i:"::':':::': i ............................................... .............................................................................. : :::: . .. ... . .. : :?: :-: ?:?: ?i:iii:!!i:: ?i:?:iiiiiiiiiii?iii!!i?ii!ii?i: Fig. 29 peribolos, near its entrance (5m wide), in the middle of its W side. By this time building IA was no longer in use. Building O also had some kind of religious function, judging by its finds; the latter included LG and EA sherds, the remains of a large central hearth, metal jewellery and clay lamps. Finally, an unexpected and important find was the discovery of a small circular fishing weight (0.75m diameter) on the threshold of building I, bearing the earliest inscription from anc. Oropos, the name letEtktio; (Fig. 29). The context of the weight is dated to the second half of the 8th Ct BC, while the alphabet itself is most probably Euboean. On the whole, it seems that the area enclosed by the peribolos wall was devoted to the worship of the Nymph Alia, later named Leukothea, whose shrine was probably located in the vicinity, judging by the inscribed bases of dedicatory tripods of the HL period, discovered in the surrounding area. The connection of this nymph with the Telchines, deities associated with metallurgy, could be related to the workshop evidence discovered at the site. As regards the settlement, (of the G ana A periods), lying to the W of C and HL Oropos, it should be probably identified with the famous Graia, men- tioned in the Iliad, the inhabitants of which, took part in the colonization of Cyme and of Pithecussai (mod. Ischia) in Italy. Thorikos. M. Oikonomakou reports on the final session of excavation of the Doric building at Thorikos in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (23-24). It was ascertained that the monument had suffered two destruction phases: one in the Ist Ct AD, when sections of it were removed and then taken to the Athenian Agora for the construction of the so-called SW temple, and one in the 19th Ct AD, when, after the excavation of the Dilettanti in 1813, parts of the building were looted for the construction of new buildings in the mod. settlement of Laurion. Although an architectural reconstruction was possible, no further progress was made as regards the determination of the original use of the building (for the plan see AR 1996-97, 16). ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF Aigina Kolonna. Prof. F. Felten reports on the Austrian Institute excavations in 1997: "The survey of the first building phase of G. Welter's excavations at the W point of Cape Kolonna ('Attaleion') was brought to a close. Debris on the S slope of the hill in the area of the ascent was removed. The neglected and untidy excava- tion area was improved by the removal of old excavation debris. A new, temporary ascent road was constructed. In house 11 there was stratigraphic investigation of EBA levels: a sequence of EBA settlement horizons was found. Pottery finds go back to the N. In house 23, a sounding by G. Welter was identified, which went down to the rock, and there was stratigraphic investigation of the unexcavated areas around the edges (end of EBA to N); also clearance of an EH III house with a curved E wall and clearance of an EHII wall running E-W. In houses 24-25 there was cleaning and removal of the modem backfill in Welter's sondages; also preparations for stratigraphic investigations in 1998. In the area between the fortification wall and houses 23-25, an attempt was made to find a stratigraphic connection between fortification and settlement phases. However, the excavations by Welter went so deep that no MBA finds were retrieved. The most important result is the identification of a destruction horizon in EH III, which provides a firm chronological point and guarantees the connection with the results of the excava- tions of 1970-1980. In this area, too, a short EH II wall running E-W was found, which throws new light on the settlement density in EH II. In the S wall of house 21 a well going down to sea level was excavated. The pottery found revealed that it was filled in during LC times. Cleaning and survey of the E suburb was an important precondition for future restoration work. Photographic docu- mentation was made of the present state of the E suburb. The work carried out serves as basis for an archaeological descrip- tion (separation of phases) and the opening of the E suburb to the public." Sanctuary of Zeus Hellanios. The DAI reports: "The investigations at the sanctuary of Zeus Hellanios on Mt Oros, which were begun in 1904 (A. Furtwangler, L. Curtius) and 1933 (G. Welter), have been resumed under the direction of H.R. Goette. Already in 1995 the area and the visible walls were surveyed in detail, and at the beginning of June 1997 a ten-day campaign of cleaning and excavation took place. The area on the N slope of Oros selected in 1997-the location of the temple and the altar on the peak is to be investigated in a later campaign-consists of two terraces that are separated on the N by high walls from the terrain below. On the E the area is bordered by high rocks which in antiquity supplied the building material for the currently visible architec- tural remains. On the W, another terrace wall merges in the course of the southerly rising terrain into a double-faced enclosure which finally turns E on the S side and runs towards a cistern. First the S part of the area described, as well as the broad ramp of stairs on the N, were thoroughly cleared of grass and scrub. The excavation trench made by G. Welter on the E of the upper terrace (Fig. 30, view from the E) was also cleared of washed-in soil and vegetation. On the E part of the upper terrace a section was excavated in order to establish whether a row of interior supports had existed in this part of the building, as G. Welter (AA 1938, 11 fig. 5) had supposed, i.e. whether a completely roofed, four-aisled hall, a hypostyle room, must</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 19 M..;: q* As - 4. ?::: 7-:: Ty~il~%~~~d ~ 88~~iii _L10:- Ti-i 1A 7::: ~ la~s I~ LL~9~BP ?r- ~ -:'~1:";:~`~I~?2~*a`s;uar~pp~y ;ir-- - lsBL~Lgi~~irara:~? n r~P?

Under the in situ foundation slabs for the supports on the N there is another, rougher layer of stone slabs; the excavation proved that this is not the case in the area in which the foundations for the central support reconstructed by Welter should appear. Instead, there is only a layer of soil with numerous stones, from smaller boulders to small rock splinters, which was intermixed with ceramic fragments and a few pieces of smashed poros building elements. The lowest layer of this fill and levelling of the terrain consists of a very hard stratum of clay soil and dense rubble; immediately above were found the latest ceramic fragments, sherds of HL relief bowls. After the investigation carried out in 1997 on the N slope of Mt Oros, in the terrace area that is to be interpreted as a festivity ground for the pilgrims to the sanctuary of Zeus Hellanios, the following results can be recorded: According to present knowledge, the four-aisled hypostyle hall reconstructed by G. Welter did not exist. But there was on the upper terrace of the complex a N-shaped peristyle: the open court was on three sides (N, E and S) enclosed by stoas, whereas the W side was bordered by a wall with an entranceway, which is to be reconstructed from existing architectural members. The pottery, especially the HL relief bowls of the lowest strata, testifies that the upper S part of the whole complex was erected in HL times. Historical considerations, already taken into account by G. Welter, make a date in the first half of the 2nd Ct BC probable, when Aigina belonged to the empire of the Pergamene kings. However, the site was already in A times-at the latest-of special importance: fragments of LA-EC roof tiles together with pieces of Doric poros architecture clearly demonstrate that there was some building already at the end of the 6th Ct BC. Finally, the well-known A inscriptions as well as Pindar's Odes are eloquent testimony for this conclusion. The investigations are to be continued." Poros. Kalaureia. Berit Wells (Swedish Institute at Athens) reports on work in 1997: "In 1894 Sam Wide and Lennart Kjellberg carried out investigations in the Poseidon sanctuary, the results of which were published in AM 20 (1895), 267-326. The report includes a state plan of the area and brief accounts of the various categories of evidence uncovered. From this evidence the excavators concluded that the cult of Poseidon could be traced back to Myc times and then continued into the R period. They equated the history of the site with that of the Kalaurian amphictyony. Since then no fieldwork has been carried out in the sanctuary and the origin of the amphictyony in PR times has been questioned. New investigations were called for. In June of 1997 we went back to Kalaureia with two objectives in mind: to make a new state plan of the sanctuary</page><page sequence="20">20 DAVID BLACKMAN iiiiiiiiiiiii i ;iiiiii iii'iiii iiil ..... ....... . .. . ....... ........ .... . .... . .... ........ .. ..... ..... ...... ... ! ! i i {iiN :i Fig. 31 and to open a trench W of the peribolos in order to begin to gain an idea of where, in the future, it would be fruitful to carry through a larger investigation. The architectural remains uncovered by Wide and Kjellberg have suffered further destruction during the 20th Ct, a farm- stead having been built over some of the anc. buildings and the land having been used for agriculture. A partial ground plan of the area was executed with the help of a total station and data collected to be used for a 3D-rendering of the area of the sanctuary with its buildings. The trench opened up W of the peribolos wall yielded the remains of part of a building, purposely filled in probably in the late 5th/early 4th Ct BC. Both the floor level of the build- ing and the stratum beneath it contained pottery, which securely dates the activities in the house to LH IIIC. At this stage we cannot determine the function of the structure but some interesting hypotheses will be explored in the future. For the present, suffice it to say that the new finds from Kalaureia fit into a context of a general shift towards the sea in the 12th Ct BC which is paralleled at Kea, Grotta on Naxos and at Koukounaries on Paros." Spetses. Building work in the area around the old harbour (plot O.T. 388) revealed a rectangular cist grave of unspecified date. Under this tomb many closed-shape vessels along with 22 bronze coins were found, the latest dating to AD 425-450. Excavations on plot O.T. 410 in the vicinity revealed an abundance of LR pottery including some intact vessels and some worn late 4th/early 5th Ct AD coins. A little further from the latter site a coin of Nikephoros Phokas (963-68) was also found, along with a re-struck coin of Herakleios (610-41). (ADelt 69) A treasure of gold coins found in 1992 during excavations of EByz structures, walls and a tower at Zogeria in the NW of the island appears to complement others found in the same locality in 1962 and 1970. The 1962 treasure (27 solidi of Justinian I and three of Justin II) and that of 1970 (114 bronze minimi and folles) is now increased by 11 solidi and two tremisses of Justinian I, Justin II, Tiberios and Maurice (AD 527-602). This significant collection may have been hidden during the Slav invasions of Greece recorded during Maurice's. reign. It and the excavations may indicate the existence of a significant settlement here in the 5th-6th Cts. (ADelt 69-70, pl. 27a) 6 61 SAFIO BAEIAIOE Fig. 32 KORINTHIA Ag. Theodoroi. In the vicinity of Ag. Theodoroi, in the area identified as the anc. town of Krommyon (ADelt 17, 52ff), excavations pursued the 1961 investigations of the G cemetery, with the discovery of 13 new tombs, including 11 pit graves, one cist and one larnax burial, with interesting samples of Cor pottery of the M and LG period. At the E limits of the cemetery, under HL remains, lies a circular theatral area of the LA period, consisting of a circular paved floor (d: 7.40m) and 11 stone steps. To the N of the National Road to Corinth, the architectural remains of the C and HL town (Fig. 31) were investigated, including roads, parts of houses, workshop areas with a drainage system, a pear-shaped cistern and a multitude of portable finds: pottery, idols, lamps, coins, a miniature painted altar, etc. (ADelt 54-6) Agios Vasilios. Timothy E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on explorations in 1997: "With the co-operation of the 6th Ephorate of Byz Antiquities (Patras), the Ohio State University Excavations at Isthmia undertook a very brief program of study at the Med castle of Agios Vasilios in S Korinthia in July 1997. The purpose of this study was to learn more about the buildings located within the confines of the kastro, identified during previous campaigns of survey and recording. In particular, we hoped to gather information to help answer (a) whether the individual spaces located on the plan were independent buildings or rooms in larger structures, (b) whether the buildings were of one or two storeys, and (c) whether we can determine the use of any of the buildings, particularly the churches. As a result, debris was partially removed from three build- ings, identified as numbers 6, 27, and 61 on the plan (Fig. 32). No. 27, located below and just N of the keep, had been tentatively identified as a church because of its approximately E-W orientation and because it stood alone at the edge of what may have been a plateia. No. 61 is located in about the middle</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 21 of the site at the W end of a row of rooms or independent buildings; it was hoped that this might provide evidence of whether the spaces were independent buildings or rooms of a larger complex. Building 6 is located near the N (lower) end of the site; its apparently odd shape invited exploration and explication. The time allowed for this exploration was not enough to remove all the debris from any one of the three buildings. The discovery of several voussoir blocks in building 27 suggests that it was originally vaulted, and several moulded blocks, including two pier capitals, suggest that this was a monumental building, perhaps indeed a church as originally indicated. Little direct information could be discerned about buildings 6 and 61, except that their shapes were somewhat different from what was originally identified in the surface survey. It is estimated that only about one-half of the fallen debris has been removed from each of these three structures. The completion of this cleaning operation will, therefore, have to wait until the 1998 season. The condition of the walls of the buildings, however, as they have been preserved, suggests that the structures will be in relatively good state of preservation and we may be confident that they will answer the important historical and archaeological questions we have posed for the everyday architecture of the later Med period." Corinth. Charles K. Williams, II, reports on the ASCS excavations at Anc. Corinth in spring 1997: "These excavations were a direct continuation of the exploration of the two areas investigated the previous season. The first sector, directed by C.K. Williams, II, lies immediately S and SE of the site museum, where levels of the 12th, 13th and 14th Cts have been revealed during the past nine years. The second area, directed by G.D.R. Sanders, is 80 to 190m SSE of the SE corner of the Cor forum, where exploration has uncovered a LR bath and a large part of an urban villa with elaborate mosaic floors, probably of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD. This second area was first excavated by the Greek Archaeological Service and has been extensively expanded during the last two years. The first area has at its core a colonnaded public street that was sited close to W edge of the Frankish city. The space is now over 67m long N-S and is ca 17m wide. Originally this was thought to be an approximately rectangular plateia; now it appears to be a broad roadway leading toward the base of Akrokorinthos. On the W side of the roadway S of unit 1, investigation of unit 5 and the NE corner of unit 6 was extended to the S of unit 5 for about 22m, but, even so, the S limit of the street, here over 5m wide, still remains to be found. Frankish levels of the later 13th century. A limited and specifically focused excavation was conducted within Frankish unit 5 where it is contiguous to the S wall of unit 1. Work within unit 5, especially over the W wall of its E-W corridor and in the gravel of the narrow E-W lane W of the corridor, was undertaken to isolate the different construction phases that appear to exist here. An original construction and an extensive rebuilding were documented below the various poorly pre- served, later occupation levels. Farther S the northernmost room of unit 6 was cleared; it does not appear to be, in toto, part of the original structure, for the bottommost stones of its S wall are largely without foundation and in places sit on stones of an earlier construction that protrudes beyond its face. The room appears to have been used until its collapse in the earthquake of ca AD 1300. One coin of Philip of Savoy, struck after 1300, may be evidence for the alteration of the room after the earthquake. Elsewhere evidence for a severe earthquake, perhaps that of 1300, which is attested by the fallen heavy exterior door-jamb blocks, col- lapsed under stones of the faqade of the building. Three voussoirs, a keystone, jamb capital and three jamb blocks from an arched opening were recovered from the earthquake debris at the S end of unit 6. These blocks can be restored to the S end of the faqade of unit 6 as an arched entrance 0.94m wide. Also of interest is the glass found in unit 6, crushed on the floor of room 2 of the unit. From a rough count of the unmended puntiled bases, it can be assumed that there were at least 38 glass cups; fragmentary glass lamps were also found. The inventoried pottery from the debris includes C- 1997-14, an olive glazed Zeuxippos ware plate. None of the coins is later than the later 13th Ct. This year we completed the excavation of the cemetery attached to the church of unit 2. Over 200 persons had been interred there, but very few artifacts have been recovered from the graves, although the lower burials did contain slightly more jewellery than those from the topmost level. Three infants were buried with what appear to have been unbroken eggs at their side. This burial practice is not recorded for Ch graves at Corinth until this year. Over 23 coarse-ware round-mouthed and trefoil jugs may well have played a part in the burial ritual of this cemetery, for a large number have been found, badly shattered in the various fills within the room. A chronic health problem was isolated in the skeletons excavated. This was brucellosis (Malta fever), generally transmitted through goat-milk products, as well as by the handling of infected animals; its symptoms mimic malaria. A number of individuals with other severe diseases, some quite rare, were found in and around the cemetery. For example, one person was crippled in both arms with a severe form of rheumatoid arthritis. One woman buried in the cemetery failed to deliver her full-term infant, found in a transverse position within her pelvis. One adolescent suffered from a rare disease (multifocal eosinophalic granuloma) that caused it to be an invalid, most likely comatose toward the end of life. On the E side of the Frankish market street 6 contiguous 5m-square grids were laid out in an E-W line. As was true for the Frankish remains excavated in 1960 immediately N of unit 7, so it was in the upper levels of the grid squares excavated in 1997. The uppermost levels were seriously disturbed and in some places found to be almost non-existent. Although only small segments of some walls remained in situ, the form of the ruins was determinable by backfilled wall trenches, intact floor levels, undisturbed fills such as tile fall and packing, bothroi and a single well, 1997-1. The plan of Frankish unit 7 is that of rooms around an interior court. Excavation has unearthed a large part of three W rooms. Probably a single row of rooms existed along the N side. Much of the foundation for the N exterior wall and NE corner of the building were excavated in 1960, at which time the fabric was found to be preserved to a maximum height of 85.38m above sea level; this year the original surface of the court of unit 7 was found at 85.42m above sea level. Well 1997-1 stands close to the NE corner of the court. It is surrounded by earth and gravel layers over a clay stratum. The earliest, lower floor is of crushed limestone and sandy gravel. In one spot SW of the well at least five distinct layers of crushed poros had been laid down over pit 1997-1, which had been dug just before the erection of unit 7. Post-Frankish construction not only destroyed the S end of the E wall of the Frankish court but unfortunately also elimin- ated the S end of a platform or semi-circular step that had</page><page sequence="22">22 DAVID BLACKMAN Forum Excavations , E Village School . :   --  , .~:. ...:.:.:.':.:: .'.:.:::: . o? o oo ," o , ," o , ,"o ,,",o o . oo-:0 o , , , , o , * 0 : : ::0 0 ? .

In a second phase the court of unit 7 was changed, with a wall erected parallel W of the original E wall. It probably served as the W wall of a shed designed to run along the E side of the court. The area around well 1997-1 was also redesigned, apparently so that it could be roofed over. The court probably was mainly for service and practical use, rather than for socializing and meeting. One type of activity that appears to have been conducted within the court of building 7 can be inferred from the debris found along the E side of the court. Dr Lynn Snyder analysed the material and suggests that the area was used for the butchering of animals. Since the hoofs and other crucial parts of the animals are missing from the assemblage, the gorier side of food processing, slaughter and skinning, was probably performed elsewhere. Unit 7 appears to have been built early within the last quarter of the 13th Ct. The date of construction is securely fixed both by coins and by a pre-occupation ceramic sequence. This stratigraphic evidence was sealed below the original floor of the courtyard at the time of construction. The roadmetal immediately under the court contained an accumulation of pottery that can be dated within the 3rd quarter of the 13th Ct, evidenced by the latest coin in the fill, issued by William de Villehardouin. The accumulation rested directly upon a thick level of earth that contain Byz material of the 3rd-4th quarter of the 12th Ct with no Frankish glazed pottery. A 12th-Ct Byz roadway was found to underlie the court of unit 7. The W side of the road terminates against a later 12th- Ct Byz structure, the plan of which appears to be a house with a series of rooms surrounding a small court. This is assumed even though the S side of the building still lies buried in unexcavated earth. The domestic objects that were recovered reinforce the domestic quality of the building; weaving seems to have been an activity that was conducted within its walls. The only levels of the 1st half of the 12th Ct excavated this year were under unit 7 in the Byz building with court, in the N-S roadway along its E face and in a single room W of the house with court. The late 12th-Ct house with court appears to have had two phases, with very little difference in the plan of the two. The differences are in the thickness of the party wall between the court and the room E of the court, in the size of room 2 and in room 4 at the SW corner of the house court, which was configured in a new way." G.D.R. Sanders reports on excavation in the Panagia Field: "In 1997 excavation proceeded in the area S of the site of the Panagia church, SE of the Roman Forum. Work concen- trated on a small LR bath (D on the plan: Fig. 33), and on two superimposed R houses (C on the plan) at the NE corner of the intersection of two streets, one leading S past the village school and the other running E from Anaploga to the main Argos highway. The late date of the bath, partly excavated by the Greek Archaeological Service and almost completely revealed by campaigns in 1995 and 1996, was established beyond doubt (Fig. 34). Excavation in 1995 and 1996 produced context pottery which indicated that the bath was built after the mid- 5th Ct and possibly as late as the mid-6th Ct. Part of the surviving cement and very fragmentary opus sectile floor in the entrance hall at the N was removed and the underlying strata were excavated to provide data from contexts physically sealed by the floor. The robbing trench of a large N-S wall, presumably the E wall of the structure, was excavated to the lowest levels of its</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 23 original foundations. Quantities of fragmented fresco, C to HL and ER to MR pottery from disturbed deposits were found in the robbing trench as well as several later ceramics. Stewpot rims and fragments of white-painted Palestinian amphoras, were found throughout the fill to its lowest level at a depth of over 2.3m below the cement floor. The stewpots are character- istic of the 6th Ct and the amphoras could conceivably date as early as the 5th Ct. The robbing trench cut through a stratum dating to the 5th Ct and contained a lens of fill, excavated in 1996, in which was found a rimsherd of NAfRS, Hayes form 104. None of the coins within the robbing trench fill could be dated more precisely than to the 5th or 6th Ct. Immediately after the robbing trench had been filled, an insubstantial structure was built with its NE comer overlying the cutting. This was promptly demolished to resume the construction of the bath. The lowest wall courses of this shed- like building were covered by a floor on which white mortar and, subsequently, hydraulic cement was mixed. Over the mixing floors was thick layer of schisty marble chips from shaping the bath's revetment plaques. A shallow fill of earth levelled the construction fill for the white cement foundation for the opus sectile floor of the hall. The marble chip stratum also contained rim fragments of 6th-Ct stewpots. It is clear that the foundation of the bath dates after the beginning, and probably towards the middle, of the 6th Ct. Close architectural parallels with the Panagia bath indicate that the small bath at Zevgolatio, published by S. Charitonidis and R. Ginouves in 1955, is probably considerably later than originally suggested. Certain other small baths at Corinth, specifically baths above the S basilica, at the N end of the Lechaion Road and to the E of the ASCS' excavation house, can probably be down-dated to the 5th or 6th Ct. It is tempting to speculate that the robbing trench reflects a period of stone reclamation for Justinian's program of fortification at Corinth. The MR and LR houses revealed by the Greek Archae- ological Service and by the ASCS in 1996 are located to the SW of the bath. This work exposed part of a mid-5th-Ct R house over the impluvium court and mosaic pavements of an earlier urban villa, probably of the late 2nd to mid-3rd Ct. The fine geometric mosaics of the MR house to the SE of the bath were originally consolidated by the Archaeological Service. After over ten years the mosaics required cleaning and further conservation. This work was carried out after the end of the 1996 season. Then a strong terrace wall was built along the S and part of the W side of the excavation to prevent damage to the mosaics and impluvium from earth collapses and flooding. Results of Dr David Romano's road project indicated that the E wall of the impluvium court coincided with the W side of a postulated road dividing two of the city's insulae. A strip 4m wide by 16m long was excavated along the E side of the house with a view to exposing the road and to establishing the point of access to the building. This goal was frustrated by the discovery of a series of rooms belonging to the house. Evident- ly the road was omitted from the intended scheme and the house was considerably larger than first thought. At the N end of the strip the SW quadrant of a large room with a fine marble floor and a central fountain was revealed. The floor is made of large plaques of red veined marble separated by strips of blue veined marble with squares of rosso antico at the interstices. The octagonal fountain has a diameter of 1.6m. It has a broad marble ledge marked off from the floor by a vertical marble lip. The marble plaques are separated by strips of blue and rosso antico. The impression of the water pipe feeding the fountain head can be clearly seen in the cement substructure where the plaques have been removed. The pipe ran from the NE corner to a point close to the SE edge. Here a squared impression marks the location of the fountain head. The fountain appears to have been centrally placed within a rectangular room as much as 5.5m wide by 9.5m long. From its position the water spout clearly did not send out a vertical jet of water. Its off-centre location indicates that the spout was likely to have been a sculpted figure facing NW and directing water into the centre of the pool. It was thus designed to be seen in three-quarter view either from the W or, more likely, from the N. A lead outflow pipe is preserved on the E side. This room bore traces of a burnt destruction with fine ash and roof tiles overlying the well preserved portions of the pool and its surrounds. The tile and ash was disturbed soon after the fire when the lead piping and fountain head were recovered for use elsewhere. At the S end of the strip a burnt level lay under a collapse of broken Lakonian roof tiles. A number of cover tiles were recovered but only one could be reassembled sufficiently to reconstruct its full dimensions of 0.6 x 0.9m. Soon after the roof collapse a narrow path was cleared through the tile to gain access to the impluvium court from the E. The area remained unused as rainfall slowly eroded the mudbrick or pis6 super- structure of the walls. During this process large fragments of wall painting exfoliated and fell from the upper walls while some fresco still adheres to the lower west wall where pre- served. The laborious work of cleaning, mending and conserva- tion of the fresco is still in progress. The overall pattern is still indistinct but there are indications that there was a marbled design on the dado with rectangular panels containing central figural designs above. LR and Med activity was abundantly evident. In the S a series of silty strata to the south contained abundant 5th-Ct pottery including stewpots characteristic of the period and an almost complete bowl of NAfRS Hayes form 73. A heavy gold ring was also found. Subsequent stone retrieval operations, probably in the 6th Ct, removed the E wall of the courtyard at its northward extension revealing a pre-R inspection hole for the city's subterranean water system. The 'manhole' is loosely filled with boulders but little else. Its exposure served to drain water running off the steep slope to the S for several decades after its being uncovered. A large depression formed around the sinkhole. In an effort to level off the area a large quantity of amphoras and domestic pottery cleaned out from an early 7th-Ct burnt destruction of a building in the vicinity was dumped into the hole. About a dozen distinct amphora forms are represented including Gaza, Palestinian, Pannel and LR amphora type 2. A coin of Tiberius II (580-81) was found in the dump but the date is secured by a large NAfRS dish which is probably E to M 7th-Ct. As the fill subsided with time, a further attempt was made to fill the depression in the 1 Ith Ct with large quantities of tile, cobbles, earth and broken pottery. Walls of the MByz period, with which a tile grave containing a single inhumation with a redeposited bone stack representing several individuals were probably associated, were robbed to the bottom of their foundations in the mid-12th Ct. Unfortunately one such robbing trench cut away most of the tile grave. It is now becoming clear that the MR house was very large. It may have extended as far as the road frontages proposed by the Corinth roads survey: 25m to the W and 35m to the S. It is also possible that the painted fresco lifted in 1996, and the associated burnt destruction found 20m to the NE under the LR bath also belonged to the building. At the SW corner of the bath more of the fresco was lifted in the room which produced</page><page sequence="24">24 DAVID BLACKMAN + 4WXAMILION WALL R0AI . ".... r.... a....S T -IM IA .... .... ".

Little other material culture was found by which to date the conflagration and tile horizon in and over which the fresco was found. However, an almost complete stewpot, which dates the event to the mid- to late 3rd Ct, was recovered." Ancient Corinth. Excavations at the Plevres site (Karamanou plot), outside the walls of the anc. city, uncovered part of a cemetery, with continuous use from the 2nd Ct AD to the ECh period. Two groups of burials were located. A rectangular funerary chamber was discovered with vertical pit graves dug into the walls on either of the long sides. A second phase therein consisted of five vaulted chamber tombs and one covered with tiles. Two pit graves and a rubbish heap were also uncovered. Multiple burials were common, and some skeletons lack the skull. Of the large amount of moveable finds, the most interesting are black-painted lamps, skyphoi, kylikes, Cor plates, clay female figurines, etc. Also, two small human heads made of glass paste, a lamp disk with a depiction of gladiators, parts of inscribed plaques (0.25 x 0.25 x 0.65m inscr. VIVLIA / EISEX / AGA; 0.30 x 0.23 x 0.035m inscr. BAAEPI (E) M/CEKOYNAOC / BAAEPICM / PINOOC). Ch lamps with raised handles were among the most important finds. Made of brown or red clay, these bear the marks of Attic workshops on their bases. The disks are alternately decorated with crosses, rosettes, star motifs, etc., while the lip is decor- ated with herringbone patterns, upright and inverse arches, relief circles and foliate motifs. (ADelt 167) Isthmia. Elizabeth R. Gebhard (ASCS) reports on the Univer- sity of Chicago excavations in 1997: "Geophysical survey of the sanctuary at Isthmia is being carried out to define the major natural and man-made depositional changes throughout the historical periods. The work in 1997, directed by Apostolis Sarris from the Foundation of Research and Technology in Rethymnon, Crete, continues earlier work begun in 1987. In July the University of Chicago team employed an electromagnetic conductivity meter to test selected portions of the sanctuary. The instrument records soil conductivity to an effective depth of 6m, and measurements were taken at Im intervals. A few preliminary results, and the reasons for testing each of these areas, are described below. Within the temenos three areas were tested (Fig. 35). The first lies NE of the temple where the dump for the excavations from 1952-89 was located until its removal in 1995-96. The NE section of the Greek temenos lies within its limits, and we seek information on the configuration of the A temenos, its boundary wall, and related ground formations. Based on small test trenches excavated in 1952, the fill is shallow, varying from less than Im to ca 2.5m in depth over an area whose surface slopes from ca -1.00 to -3.00m below the site datum. A total of ca 800 m2 was covered. The second area lies between the NE cave and the theatre, where a gully existed in the LG/EA period that, we believe, was used as a major pathway leading to the central temenos. During the later Gr and R periods the gully was filled by a series of terraces that extended the usable surface of the temenos plateau. An area of ca 230m 2 was measured that we hope will yield information on the depth of the gully and the location of the pathway. The third area, of ca 800m2, lies N of the first on a terrace located halfway between the temenos and the R bath, at an elevation 8-10m below the site datum. Preliminary results seem to reveal the path of the Corinth-Isthmus road that descended from the middle of the N side of the temenos plateau from A through early R times. The position of the road indicates it sloped downward rather steeply from the temenos and then curved to the E behind the scene building of the theatre in a position that was occupied by the theatre court during the Antonine period. Another area of the sanctuary that was tested lies S of the Rachi settlement in the valley that leads SW from the later stadium (Fig. 36). This area contains several sections of a long wall running along the base of the slope on the S side of the valley that Broneer identified as part of a Mycenaean trans- Isthmian wall (see 'The Cyclopaean Wall on the Isthmus of Corinth and its Bearing on Late Bronze Age Chronology', Hesperia XXXV (1966), 346-362, and an addendum in Hesperia XXXVII (1968) 25-35). At the extreme SW corner of the area, the recent cleaning of the curved portion of this wall gave us the opportunity to examine its masonry. Based on the workmanship of the wall, portions of which contain ashlar masonry, it seems more likely that at least this portion of the wall is of Gr date. The overall configuration of the entire area with its relatively regular sloping sides, curved wall at the W end, its overall length of ca 350m, and its close association with the later stadium suggests the hypothesis that the area may contain the remains of the anc. hippodrome. The geo- physical survey was conducted in the hope that the data may provide additional evidence for assessing the function of this large tract. In the 'hippodrome' we were able to collect four long transects of conductivity data. Each transect consisted of three parallel lines 2m apart, on which we collected data at Im</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 25 WEXAHILION RAVINE ROMAN TORPTRCSS 0RESCQVOIR c, MWALL IQ It ~S T A? 9y\s ? P 0 I DOIN4 wrPow C~Mtf~to" r c fLILf Fig. 36 intervals. The S end of transect 4 is a fairly level man-made fill behind the embankment of the stadium that might be an extension of the hippodrome or connected with its use. The data from all these transects consist of approximately 1,200 measurements. The marble lion's-head sima from the C temple of Poseidon is one of the finest examples of Gr architectural sculpture from the C era. According to the reconstruction drawings by Piet de Jong, there were 78 segments, each ca 0.74m high and 1.48m in length with a lion-head spout flanked by palmettes. The majority of fragments are made of a grey coarse-grained marble that Broneer identified as belonging to the 4th-Ct repairs to the temple, whereas the original 5th-Ct pieces were made of Attic or island white fine-grained marble and have distinctively better workmanship. Broneer suggested that a few examples of a third type made of white micaceous marble and of 'inferior workmanship' may belong to repairs in R times. Recent study of the damage and repairs to the C temple have called into question the sequence of alterations to the building. Although Broneer published a catalogue of 43 horizontal and 5 raking sima fragments from the C temple (Isthmia 1, pp. 150-160), these represent only a relatively small portion of the more than 300 fragments that were recovered. During the 1997 season a preliminary examination of all these fragments was made and ca 100 additional fragments were inventoried. The grey marble fragments show extensive use of drill work and a toothed chisel, characteristics that might suggest a R date. This series includes a large number of palmettes that were carved separately and doweled to the sima below, apparently to save on material. The micaceous white marble fragments were tentatively re-identified as belonging to the same series of carvings as the white marble fragments that Broneer assigned to the 5th-Ct temple. In addition, a large fragment of a piece that matches a well-preserved sima found in Corinth (Cor. A 832) suggests that at some point a series of pieces that have grossly different dimensions and design were incorporated into the roof with the earlier pieces. The study is still very much in its preliminary stages and additional work will need to be completed in the future. There was some re-organization of the storage areas of the apotheke: new shelf lists were made and the computer database files updated. Consultations were held with Anita Moraitou on the development of a conservation area for the Kenchreai glass panels within the Isthmia apotheke. Plans were also made for the construction of a roof to protect the recently conserved lustral area (west waterworks) at the W end of the temenos." Timothy E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on the Ohio State Univer- sity excavations in 1997: "With the assistance of the 4th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities (Nauplion) and the 6th Ephorate of Byz Antiquities (Patras), we carried out a program of study and research at Isthmia in June-August 1997. The primary goal of the 1997 season was the reorganization and consolidation of existing projects and programs. Key to</page><page sequence="26">26 DAVID BLACKMAN this was the fundamental overhaul and updating of our com- puter-based information systems. Design and coding of several modules was completed in Microsoft Visual Basic and Access, including ceramics processing, excavation unit recording, inventory, as well as the all-important basic semantic structure of the information system. The design philosophy and actual modules will be shared with colleagues, demonstrated at the AIA meetings this coming December, and modified as a result of ongoing discussion. All of this will be made available to the Archaeological Service at the earliest possible moment. Research continued in the R bath in 1997, led by Omuir Harmansah, who worked on the architectural documentation of the building, Jayni Phillip, who gathered further information on the marble used in decoration, and Robert A. Seelinger, who is studying the window glass and miscellaneous finds from the building. Mr Harmansah revised and completed the 12 section- elevation drawings, illustrating nearly all aspects of construc- tion of the R bath. He also completed drawings of the pool at the SE comer of room XIII and a series of drawings that illustrate features that seem to date from an earlier phase of construction of the building: these include the door between rooms III and X, that between rooms III and VI, and the brick structure that lies under the statue base at the E end of room VI. Ms. Phillip discovered many new decorative elements in the R bath, including the remains of a marble basin which must have been set up in the apse of room IX of the building. She refined the categories of marbles removed from the building and made progress in her understanding of the overall decor- ative scheme. Professor Seelinger has essentially completed his study of the window glass from the R bath and has now done preliminary work on the some 80 small finds from the struc- ture. The Hexamilion Spolia Project continued research begun in 1996 to locate, record, describe, photograph and draw all reused architectural blocks built into the Hexamilion wall. Progress this year consisted primarily in improving recording techniques, building a sophisticated database, and photo- graphing and drawing many of the blocks discovered last year. Fieldwork was concentrated in the area from the R bath eastward to tower 15 of the Byz fortress. To date 83 blocks in this area have been fully recorded, photographed and drawn. A program of geophysical exploration was undertaken in conjunction with the Foundation for Research and Technology of the University of Crete and the University of Chicago Excavations at Isthmia. This project utilised electrical resis- tance, magnometry and other methods in exploration of the E Field and the unexcavated area SE of the R bath. Results of this program are being prepared by Apostolos Sarris of the University of Crete. A preliminary geomorphological survey in E Korinthia was carried out by Professors Jay Noller and Lisa Wells. They were able to gather essential topographic and geological information necessary to begin the creation of a geomorphological map of the Korinthian coast of the Saronic Gulf, from the Korinth Canal S to Korfos. They made regional observations of natural and agricultural soils (e.g. type, depth, distribution and relative age), hill-slopes (e.g. agricultural terraces, landslides and slumps, soils vs bedrock). In addition, they made important preliminary observations on the evidence for seismically active faults in the region that should have bearing on the pace and location of rapid landscape change. Research also continued in the area of the so-called E field, E of the temple of Poseidon, partially excavated by Professor Paul Clement for UCLA in 1970-1972. It is still not possible to elucidate the precise function of the buildings in this area and their relationship to the sanctuary itself, although progress toward this end has clearly been made and we are in the process of compiling a preliminary report on the excavations in the E field. Limited conservation was carried out on the border of the mosaic in room VI of the R bath. Preliminary agreement was made on this plan for construction of a roof to cover and protect the mosaic, and we hope that work on construction of the roof can begin as quickly as possible." Kyra-Vrysi. An extensive account is provided on work done on Justinian's Hexamilion wall (ADelt 164-66). This work was executed prior to the construction of major road and rail arteries in the Athens-Corinth-Patras highway. A section some 215m long was uncovered to its foundations on bedrock, on which the entire wall (some 7,500m) rests. Three square towers were identified. Masonry identifies two phases in the excavated wall: Justinian (during 548-565) and Manuel II (in 1415). Finds on the outer side of the wall include sherds of Carthage amphoras, African red slip, open vessels, plates and a lamp of N African type, all dated to the 6th-7th Ct. On the inner side, sherds of glazed pottery from the 13th-15th Ct predominate. Coins include a 'treasure' of 44 tornesi picollo, but little from other periods. Nemea. Stephen G. Miller (ASCS) reports on the first of a five-year program of renewed excavations: '"This season was concentrated in the SW sector of the sanctuary, and particularly in the river. The first goal was to locate the line and depth of the river in antiquity, and to find its history. The ultimate goal is to relocate the modem river into its ancient course and therefore improve drainage for the whole site and reduce the threat of destruction to the anc. remains (it frequently overflows its banks and it cuts through anc. layers and structures even when not flooding). It was dis- covered in 1996 that this modem river-course had been created by a team of French engineers in 1881 and that the valley had been a swamp for centuries before that drainage was under- taken. Excavations in grid sections H 19 and H 18 revealed that the older river was several metres W of its modem course. In the 12th and 13th Cts it had been somewhat larger than today, but still never exceeded a total width of 2m and was located about 10m W of the EHL bath (i.e. 7m W of the modem river which has a maximum width of 1.50m). The ECh period, however, saw a formidable river which was, at times, as wide as 12m and was marked by heavy layers of gravel indicating a continuous flow of large amounts of water. Although the river of this period wandered over a large E-W path in its northward course, it was centred about 17m W of the bath. Extremely large masses of domestic pottery and other debris along the E bank of the river suggest that it was used as a dumping ground in the ECh period. A bronze belt buckle with incised decoration in the form of a swan is particularly noteworthy. The HL river was much more confined and had a maximum width of 6m, and was centred 16m W of the bath. The bottom of the river of that period was not reached, but already a few fragments of A and Myc pottery show that it stayed more or less in the same location throughout those periods. We did reach a depth 1.34m below that of the modern river and 1.16m below the floor of the bath (a basic problem with drainage of the archaeological site since 1924 has been that the modern river was higher than the bottom of the bath). Excavations in future years will continue the anc. depth further N in the valley</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 27 and the antiquities in the sanctuary will therefore be much safer from the ravages of flooding than they have been until now. On the E side of the river a 0.15m thick layer of white clay begins W of the middle of the bath and extends northward into unexcavated areas. The S edge of this layer is marked by a trench and a much thinner layer of white earth toward the S. This was cut through in the late 4th Ct BC by the drain of the bath which ran westward into the river and which was covered by reused slabs some of which were a part of an early starting line. This may, then, be the site of the A and C stadium of Nemea. The thick white clay layer continues eastward beneath the bath. It was cut through in part by mod. drainpipes that ran northward from the bathing chamber of the bath. The first of these seems to have been installed by Blegen in 1924 or 1925, the second by Verdelis in 1958 (cf. Nemea I, 188n. 575). The white clay layer in this area was covered by a thick layer of debris very much like layers of debris from the destruction of the early Temple of Zeus found longer ago further to the N (cf. Hesperia 49 [1980] 184-186; 50 [1981] 50-54). This debris was, once again, characterised by burnt and broken architec- tural blocks, and roof tiles (some badly damaged from fire) with the known stamps on some examples and plaster/mortar still on the surfaces of many. Once again, more excavation will be necessary to define the chronological and spatial limits of the white clay layer and, hence, to confirm or deny its sug- gested identification with the A stadium of Nemea. South of the bath, and SW of the basilica, excavations in sections J 19 and K 19 revealed the remainder of the ECh house that had first been discovered in 1926, and more of which had come to light in 1982 and 1985 (Hesperia 52 [1983] 84-87, and 57 [1988] 3-8). Although badly damaged in mod. times by a road that had run over it and a stream that had run through it, the basic outlines emerged from its rubble walls. A heavy layer of destruction with roof tiles and rough wall plaster clearly belongs in the later 6th Ct AD and must be associated with the destruction wrought by the Slavic invasion in ca AD 585. The discoveries within this house were plentiful, but clearly the most interesting was a spouted courseware pot that had been deliberately buried beneath the floor of one room. In it was a hoard of coins consisting of 18 fractional bronzes and one gold solidus of Justinian I. A well that belonged to the house was partially excavated, but its collapsing walls prevented full investigation. Nonethe- less, it had clearly been filled deliberately with masses of architectural debris. Beneath the ECh house there appeared a continuation of the branch of the EHL terracotta aqueduct first discovered in 1982 (Hesperia 52 [1983] 88 and pl. 27, b). The aqueduct continues to the SW beyond the excavated area. A massive curvilinear wall was also found. It is rough on the inside and cannot have been part of a free-standing, roofed building. Since it is oriented with regard to the aqueduct, it may have played some role in that context. Both the curvilinear wall and the aqueduct lie along and on the N side of the E-W road that, at this point and because of those structures, curves toward the SW to run out of the excavated area. This road was the successor to a straight E-W road of the A period that had first been discovered in 1982 (see Hesperia 52 [1983] 92 and pl. 28, a). This year more of that road was found at the lowest points reached in the excavations. The lower levels were investigated inside and outside of the SW corner of the hero shrine of Opheltes. It was discovered that an E-W road of the 5th Ct BC ran alongside a mound that had been artificially created in the 6th Ct BC. The full extent of this mound has not been established, but it appears to have been somewhat larger than the later HL hero shrine (perhaps as much as 40 or 50m diameter). Its height when first con- structed was at least 2m. If we are correct in believing that it has been truncated in more recent times, the original height at the centre of this mound will have been significantly greater than it appears today. The mound was created by the use of three different materials. First is a series of crude masses of rough unworked stone. The top of one of these stone masses had been found already in 1980 (Hesperia 50 [1981] 63-64), and it now appears to be a part of a curved mass of stone that defines the mound on the W. The other stone masses lie to the S of the first, the southernmost directly beneath the rectilinear wall of the hero shrine. The second type of material is a sandy clay that varies in colour from pink to beige, apparently depending upon the source that produced it. This earth is essentially devoid of artifacts and we had already probed its upper parts in 1980 (ibid. 63: 'The whole of our test trench produced barely a handful of pottery...'). However, a number of whole, or nearly whole, vessels were deliberately buried at the time of the creation of the mound. The preponderance were skyphoi, usually buried separately from one another: a total of 15 examples of this shape were discovered. Other drinking vessels were also discovered, including mugs. The circumstances of discovery in two cases merit especial mention: a trefoil oinochoe was discovered lying on its side and, directly beneath its mouth, a two-handled mug; the earth in the mug was significantly different in colour and texture from the surround- ing earth and is now being analysed by soil chemists at the University of Crete. In another case, an oinochoe was found standing upright in the otherwise sterile sandy clay, but it was surrounded by four skyphoi in a clearly deliberate placement. In addition, an iron spearhead and a bronze mesomphalic phiale were also deliberately set into different parts of this soil, which also produced a remarkable terracotta centaur. All of this material was buried as a part of the same activity and all clearly belongs in the A period, but some pieces as early as the middle of the 6th Ct and others as late as the very early 5th Ct BC. Finally, the third type of material used in the creation of this mound was the soft native bedrock that is familiar, for example, on the slopes of the HL stadium. This had been quarried and set deliberately at the outer limits of the mound with a top surface sloping toward the centre of the mound. It thus appears that an attempt was made to create a 'natural' mound that would seem venerable to the visitor. Hence, it would seem that the hero shrine was not the anc. cult centre that we had supposed, but rather a creation of the time of the foundation of the games, made to fill out the necessary accoutrements of the sanctuary. If this interpretation is con- firmed in 1998, then we will have uncovered extremely important evidence for the history of Nemea, and with implica- tions for the Pelopeion at Olympia. Above this early mound were layers of EHL date that produced large quantities of well-preserved bronze and silver coins with relatively little material of other types. We look forward to continuing the investigation of this area in 1998. Finally, our excavation activities included assisting Mrs Zoe Aslamantzidou of the Nauplion Ephorate in salvage excava- tions about 150m N of the apodyterion of the stadium. A trench dug alongside the mod. road for the new Stymphalos- Corinth aqueduct came down on part of a substantial building with heavy layers of destruction debris and some good pottery</page><page sequence="28">28 DAVID BLACKMAN of the late 4th Ct BC. This building must lie more or less at the juncture of the E-W road from the sanctuary of Zeus to Kleonai and the N-S road that led to the stadium. The identity of the building is obviously not yet known and it will be necessary to purchase the two fields where this building lies buried as a preliminary to excavating it. Because of the large quantity of important discoveries, more than normal conservation efforts were necessary for the ceramics-especially for those from the heroon. A special effort was also made to clean and conserve metallic artifacts-both new discoveries and old ones that were already in the museum. One aspect of this work continues, for the inscribed lead tablets must be consolidated by a process that can be undertaken only in the National Museum in Athens. Agreement has been reached with Dr Dimakopoulou for the work to be undertaken and finished during this winter in the museum laboratory. The Museum was closed to the public from February to August, during which time several additions to and changes in the display of the N hall were undertaken. The reconstructed cult table was put on display as were three recently discovered starting blocks from the early stadium. The model of the HL stadium was moved to the E window of the N hall whence the physical location of the stadium is visible, and new material from the apodyterion was added to the display. The N window at the E end of the N hall became the location of a new model of Nemea as of AD 500 which can be compared with the anc. remains visible from the window as well as with the model of Nemea as of 300 BC at the W window. Around this new model were displayed tools and jewellery as well as lamps and pottery of the 5th and 6th Cts AD, and the coins, crockery, skull, and scattered skeletal remains of the man who hid in the Stadium tunnel from the Slavic invasion in ca AD 585-the last early Christian at Nemea." Stymphalos. Dr Hector Williams (UBC/Canadian Institute) reports on the excavations in 1997: "Excavations concentrated on four areas: houses and roads in the SE part of the lower city, a sanctuary (probably of Athena) on a terrace at the W end of the acropolis, a large artillery tower at the highest point of the acropolis, and a site at the N end of the mod. village of Stymphalia (called locally 'Monastiraki'). Work in the first area (a section of a city block 30m wide) revealed a well-preserved R rebuilding with tiled floor and elaborate water-works over an earlier, HL house as well as a large deposit of complete R cooking pots of the Augustan- Tiberian periods, apparently abandoned nearby. Much Italian sigillata of the first half of the 1st Ct AD also appeared. Excavation also uncovered the intersection of a N-S road of the city grid with a major E-W avenue, which is marked by a drain built of massive conglomerate blocks. Further work in the sanctuary uncovered a late, probably ECh, multiple burial in the pronaos of the small temple, as well as many more pieces of bronze jewellery. Most striking was a small silver repouss6 woman's face with gilded hair and a pair of bronze snakes, one with finely engraved scales and traces of gilding. No further fragments of the LA kore appeared but we were able to make joins between pieces of the hand and attribute the animal found in 1995 and 1996; it appears to be a panther but unfortunately is missing its head which had been attached separately. New work on the large (22 x 1 m) tower that crowns the acropolis revealed its juncture with the city wall as well as details of the interior arrangements, including a staircase. On a burned floor appeared a hoard of over 30 lead sling bullets inscribed ARI and KA to go with the more than 130 iron catapult missile points found this year and in previous seasons in the nearby sanctuary. Reused in the interior walls of the tower was a large LA/EC Doric capital with echinus and abacus in one piece, suggesting a substantial temple nearby. Most unexpected, however, was the discovery of a 5th-Ct LR cemetery with well-built tile and plaster graves in and around the tower. This material is the first firm evidence of LR settlement in the immediate city. Our second season of work jointly with the Nauplion Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities at the Monastiraki site (2km from the anc. site) revealed more ECh graves (some dated by LR/EByz coinage), many more marble roof-tiles from a large C Doric temple whose presence is indicated by three large column drums, pieces of triglyph and of cornice. The presence of a Doric column fragment with smaller fluting (9.5cm between arrises) suggests an interior order. The wall cleared last year appears to be part of a temenos wall on the S side of the complex; we found a large triangular coping stone that probably fitted on top of it, very similar to one from the monument of the Eponymous Heroes in the Athenian agora. The presence of MByz pottery suggests a much later settlement in the area as well. While the earliest pottery from most trenches tends to be 4th-Ct BC and thus supports a date for the refounding of the city at that time, there is sufficient 5th-Ct BC material to suggest that the earlier city may in fact lie below the later. Each season has also provided more evidence for continuity of settlement (perhaps for much of the time at a modest level) from at least C times to the 6th Ct AD with resettlement from MByz times to the 16th Ct." ARGOLIS Argos. In 1992 there were eight rescue excavations reported at the mod. town of Argos, providing invaluable evidence for buildings, anc. roads and anc. burial grounds. (ADelt 85-92) Construction work for the mod. drainage system at Odos Herakleous revealed the extent of the MH III settlement and confirmed the continuous use of the area down to the LR period. The MH III settlement was located in the area between Odos Diomedous and Odos Perseos; remains of the settlement were also identified W of Odos Herakleous, up to the Argos hospital. Tombs of this period were found to the N and S of the settlement. Habitation continued in the area during the Myc period, down to LH IIIB, with no signs of interruption; in this phase habitation extended from Odos Diomedous in the S, to Odos Niobes in the N. The single Myc tomb excavated belongs to the shaft grave period. The PG and G periods are repre- sented by only 14 tombs, 11 of which were located S of the PR settlement (six stone cist tombs, five pot burials in craters). In the same area were identified the remains of three anc. roads running E-W, of post-G date; four of them preserved a retaining wall on the S side. The A and C periods are in this area represented only by sherds and a single pit, containing three burials. Pithos burials and built tombs of the G and A periods were also identified in the deeper levels, at Odos Polykleitou. LC to EHL remains were also excavated at Odos Polykleitou, including a number of rooms facing an anc. road, Im wide and over 11 m in length, with two retaining walls. Use of the road falls within the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC/early 3rd Ct BC, and continues to the 1st Ct AD. Near the road were identified the outlines of at least two kilns, also dated to the</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 29 0 1 2 ~oom 40. 0. . o. o T7 .' : .... So. TT18 Ai go.A v + 0 Fig. 37 HL period. In the SE part of the plot a small architectural unit was built along another road of LC/EHL date, while two other HL roads were investigated at Odos Kalmouhou 15. From Odos Tsiokres to Odos Niobes, the latest remains date from the HL period, reflecting a thin habitation pattern, while the area 150m N of Odos Niobes was used as a cemetery from the 2nd Ct BC to the 6th Ct AD (36 tombs, 13 parts of burial complexes). The funerary character of this area was retained in R/LR times (mostly pit graves, ten built cist tombs, five pot burials, two hut-shaped tombs and burial complexes). At Odos Miaoule the remains of LR houses were investi- gated, and also part of an anc. road with one retaining wall and a gravel surface; a HL cist tomb to the W of the road suggests that the fortifications of the anc. town did not extent to this point. Two other walls, 250m to the W of the road, are dated to the HL and LR periods, respectively. At the junction of Odos Xenophontos and Ath. Diakou was excavated part of a cemetery area, used from the MH period (tumuli H, A, B, earth-cut pit graves) to LByz times (Fig. 37). The earliest remains consist of five MH tombs, one of them stone-built with a wooden roof (LMH III), another of mudbrick and with no grave offerings, and one stone-built example reused in Myc times (LH IIB). The Myc period was repre- sented by 14 burials, including six cuttings arranged in groups, four of which were used for burials (LH III). In the same area the two remaining tombs belong to the HL (pit) and LByz periods (rectangular pit with horse burial). One G tomb was investigated at Odos Polykleitou, in an area known from other G burials (N and NE of the Agios Petros square), while at Odos Miaoule, another area used as a cemetery during the G and A periods, 30 tombs were exca- vated, including earth-cut and pithos burials, cist tombs, mostly looted, and 17 tile-roofed tombs of small size, the majority hut- shaped; two isolated pithos burials date to the 7th Ct BC. 0 ?A?; 1? y~f Fig. 38 On the Argos-Kourtaki road, part of a known necropolis was excavated in the Xerias river bed (ADelt 28, 122), dating from the end of the 5th Ct BC to the 1st Ct BC. The majority of the 25 tombs investigated were tile-roofed (8) and cists (6), including one chamber tomb with a Macedonian-type entrance. Finally, on the S edge of the mod. town, in the Paliopyrga area, a number of tombs were excavated, ranging in date from the G (5) to the R/LR period (4: pot burials, built tombs, etc.). Kokla. A Myc chamber tomb was excavated 800m E of the known Myc cemetery in the area (ADelt 37, 83). The dromos was preserved for a length of 4.70m, the entrance to the almost circular chamber was blocked with river stones, and most of the roof had collapsed. The pottery finds date it to the LH IIIA2-IIIC period. Another chamber tomb possibly lies to the N. (ADelt 92) Akova-Choune. W of Argos, in the bed of the Xerias river between Akova and Choune, were discovered four pillars and foundations of four or five more, all part of the bridge of the Hadrianic aqueduct. The two substantial walls, running parallel to the river bed, W of the pillars, were probably erected as protection against flooding. An anc. stone-built trapezoidal tower, was located at the site of Barda, W of Akova, while a similar tower was identified opposite the first one, to the N of the Xerias river. They were both dated to the 4th Ct BC and were probably meant to guard the entrance to the valley and the city of Argos, from the N. (ADelt 98-9) Asine. Restoration work was conducted in the W part of the fortification walls. (ADelt 97-8) Berbati. Berit Wells (Swedish Institute at Athens) reports on work in 1997: "The investigations of the area around the HL tower W of the cemetery in the centre of the Berbati Valley, initiated in 1995, were concluded in the fall of 1997. The 1995 season had disproved our hypothesis that the tower was an integral part of a C/HL farmstead. Instead, the site produced a ceramic workshop datable to the mid-5th Ct BC and architectural and other remains of LR date. The fieldwork of 1997 brought further evidence of ceramic production and additional material from late antiquity. The tower stands on an outcrop of bedrock and the C kiln was placed on its W side, somewhat protected by the rock (Fig. 38).</page><page sequence="30">30 DAVID BLACKMAN .. ::i-:-::; ---:-'?:-?i:i-:_::: : -: I:;:-: --?:::'i:::::-l:;:-;::--:iii~:-::--?-::i --::-i::-i~~i :;:::::-:_: ?i:?:?--i---- :i?---_-:---::--::- : :--:- -:: -i:i:::::::i:- :-:-:i:i:;i::i:: i : :: ~-i-i-:iii?-i ~i'::_:i -:i-:-.-:''-?: :? i.:.. ::'i::::.i~ i::::::::-;-- I::ii:~-_i-ii:i- -i-ii:ii-ii-i -...: ii i ii :i :: ::::: ..--.' :-:--l-l:?:i:-:l-:li-:::i: ::::::ii::--i::-:::-: ::-::: : : - :-i:-::::::?; :-:;-.:i i ::-:-:::ij:: ?:;-::::::-?-iiii-:--::_-:-_::i-i:-:-::; : :: - : ??: :: :: ::::::I ::::::::: . .: ?: :?-: - --::~:::-:??-:-:;:_-::-:::::-:-::-i:_:i: :: .:. :-:::::-__-: :::::-:--'- :i'?iii_:~-'-:i-:-':--:-- :-' -':--:-::i -::::-:::.-: i,_ii:-:::;:-i::_l: : :::-I i::i :i::::,:i:i,::::: .?:i;:::i:i:-::: : ::?::: :-:-:::i-- _ -::::::::-.- i:::;.::- :..:: i:-: -:; ::? -: - -i: ::::- -i::--ii-i:i-:i:: i;l-il?i:p-i-:?:_i-'i-:::::-:: -:: :::- ?::?l-:;::i'i: ::::-:. : . :?? :::::: ;?-::::-::::::::j:::j?:::i:--:: : : ..: j-?:::::-? .:.: ::::::::-:: i::::i::: ..-... -::, ii?-:-:j:::::-::?:: - --::-:::-i : i:-i-: :i-:i-::l_::~- _?~:: __:~i-:-:i-::-i:-:::- i : ::: -::--::::-I:-?: ::?:: :: --:::: :- ~; .::::-- :-'-:::i:i:i;- :?i- : --- i:::? : ?::: -;. :: :::-::i- _: : ::_:::__:-:::::: :::::~i~::-:_::: :; _ -: ??::;:: -:::;::--:::::;:-i-::i2:__:i:;:-:;?:':.' :::::.:-.:-::::.-' -:i-:?;i::::::: :-? :::':::-:--::: :":::- :"'--:-:--:::::-::;_:::::.::?:::-:::-: -::;:: 1?_ : : ::?-i :1~:--:::;-:-??i?l ..-.- ,r::::: Fig. 39 Misfired pieces of pottery and of tiles were found in the immediate vicinity, and terracotta wedges and tripod supports for use in the kiln give additional evidence of production. The pottery clearly points to production around the middle of the 5th Ct, which accords well with Arto Penttinen's previous con- clusions of a re-colonization of the valley by Argos at this time. Undoubtedly there was then a great demand for ceramic products and our kiln should be seen in this context. The tower is EHL in date (ca 300), the building technique reminiscent of that employed by the builders of the fortifica- tions at Asine. To judge from the extant large blocks lying at the site, we may reconstruct one additional course above what is preserved today. A superstructure of mud-brick seems plausible. The entrance to the tower lay on the E and after the structure had been excavated down to bedrock, it was obvious that reuse in LR times had obliterated almost all vestiges of the HL interior. A staircase remains, indicating a second floor, and some HL sherds had escaped the later inhabitants, lying locked in depressions in the bedrock. Associated with the tower are some remnants of walls to the W. The most exciting finds from the HL era are two inscribed blocks, reused in the LR structures. They give us merely two names: ...HANOfU and HOZEIAANIOY. The blocks closely resemble each other and therefore probably come from the same structure, possibly a grave monument or some kind of dedication. The masonry and the lettering point to a 4th-Ct date. Somewhat to the E, where the cemetery now is, was a 4th- Ct temple, two Ionic bases of which survive in the village square of Prosimni. Moreover, some ashlar blocks from this temple lie in situ by the S wall of the Agios Athanassios chapel. At the site a sizeable farm was established in late antiquity. Several large rooms, partly used for storage, were excavated S and SW of the tower. The tower itself was reconstructed as a press house. It was thoroughly cleaned out of debris, renovated and roofed. Installations for pressing and storing were con- structed in the interior. At some point the building went up in flames, possibly nourished by the fluids (olive oil?) stored inside, and the whole structure collapsed. We found the contents of the house sealed underneath the thick layer of tiles and ashes from the roof construction. The roof collapsed over a number of jars, one an amphora, which from its very highly micaceous fabric and shape is datable to the 6th Ct AD with an origin in Asia Minor, and another large amphora with combed decoration also of a 6th-Ct AD date. Three bronze coins lay on the floor, issues of Constantius II and datable to just before the middle of the 4th Ct AD. This emperor minted profusely and at many mints all over the east Mediterranean and no doubt his coins circulated for a long period of time. In any case the coins give us only a terminus post quem for the activities at the estate. An iron sickle (Fig. 39) and bill were found in one room. A good number of iron nails, some objects of bronze sheet and glass constitute other find categories. A study is under way of the residue from the water flotation, such as small bones, seeds, dung, olive pips and grape pips, botanical remains and slag. When all this has been studied we will have a fair knowledge of the environment of the estate, about the produc- tion, whether of olive oil or wine, and about life in general on a sizeable farm in late antiquity." Byzantine Argolid. G. Hadji-Minaglou and A. Oikonomou (French School) report on work in 1997: "Two principal activities were planned: a continuation of the surface survey of the area of the communities of Limnes, Prosymna and Chonika and the photogrammetric recording of several churches: the katholikon of Mone Areia, the Dormition of the Virgin of Chonika, the Dormition of the Virgin of Argos, the Metamorphosis of the Saviour in Plataniti and Ayios loannis in Ligourio. The surface survey did not happen this year, because the emphasis was finally put on the photogrammetric recording." Dokos. The Institute of Marine Archaeological Research continued in 1992 its excavations pf the EH wreck at Dokos and the Cypro-Myc wreck at Iria Point. Timothy E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on explorations on Dokos: "The Ohio State University Excavations at Isthmia con- ducted a topographic survey of the Med Kastro of Dokos in 1996 (AR 1996-97, 26-27). In 1997 we continued that survey and carried out a brief exploration of the walls of the presumed EByz basilica located in a saddle to the S of the Kastro. It has already been suggested (Amaovtica f tnoua&amp;xf 21 [1995] 97-118) that this church may have housed the relics of the Spanish martyrs Valerius, Vincentius, and Eulalia, ship- wrecked somewhere on their journey from Spain to Constantinople in the 7th Ct. Exploration in 1997 was carried out in a very short season, limited primarily to the cleaning of four small areas in the vicinity of the small church of St John the Theologian, where walls of a predecessor might be encountered. Living conditions and supply issues on this barren island hampered the project and limited the length of time we could work on the site. In addition, exploration revealed that bedrock in this area is extremely close to the surface while vegetable gardens in the churchyard also made cleaning somewhat difficult. Trench 97-1, in the area of the presumed apse, revealed only bedrock and washed fill without any trace of a built structure. A local informant told us that a pit had been dug there in the 1940s for mixing mud for construction of a nearby building. Exploration in this trench was thus a salutary lesson in precaution and demonstrated the need for cleaning before full announcement of the site was made. Exploration in trench 97-2 was likewise somewhat disap- pointing. This trench was located near the presumed E-W wall which had been tentatively identified as the N wall of the earlier basilica. The stones that had been previously been seen above the surface were cleaned and at least one other block was found that lay on the same orientation, but unfortunately the blocks were simply set in sterile soil, and no stratigraphy was found associated with them. Thus, we were able to suggest</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 31 that this did indeed represent an earlier wall, but that any stratigraphy associated with its use had been destroyed as a result of time and subsequent activity in the area. Trench 97-3 was laid out at a point symmetrical to that of 97-2 in the hope of identifying what we thought might be the S wall of an earlier structure. Fortunately in this area some stratigraphy was preserved intact between the surface disturb- ance and the bedrock. Thus, in this area were many pieces of broken roof tile and small stones, along with pottery of the 7th Ct, apparently undisturbed from where it had fallen in late antiquity. This debris was notably concentrated in the N part of the trench, so it was decided to extend the exploration to the N in a series of 1 x I m squares. As we moved northward the debris increased in quantity, although exploration showed that it rested on a level of hard-packed sterile soil, and not on any paved surface. Finally, at a point roughly on the line of the S wall of the present church of St John, we encountered a fill of stones that made up an E-W wall which had collapsed, almost certainly with its tiled roof, to the N and the S. This must have been the wall of the earlier basilica on the site. To the N, as to the S, of the wall there was no paved flooring in situ, but a single slab of marble paving, with some plaster on one side, is a probable indication that such a floor once existed but had been torn out, undoubtedly to reuse its materials for another purpose. In addition, among the debris just to the S of the wall was a marble acanthus leaf, undoubtedly part of the architec- tural decoration of the building once located on the site. The acanthus leaf is made of relatively fine white marble, heavily drilled with considerable care. On the basis of technique, this architectural decoration can be assigned to late antiquity, perhaps to the 5th or 6th Ct. Trench 97-4 was a small (1 x I m) exploration located just to the E of the SE corner of the modern church. Again, the fill was very shallow and the surface disturbed. Nonetheless, running more or less NE-SW across the cutting are the remains of a powerful mortar-poured foundation. The extent of the exploration precludes certainty, but it is possible that this foundation was for an apse at the E termination of the wall discovered in trench 97-3. Because of the shallowness of the fill and modem disturb- ances no secure date could be established for this earlier building. The marble acanthus decoration, however, together with the marble pavement slab, suggest that the building whose remains we explored was of monumental character and presumably to be assigned to the 5th or 6th Ct. Ceramics found among the debris were exclusively of the 7th Ct, and we may at least tentatively date the collapse of the building to that time. Again, certainty is impossible at this point, but it is likely that the remains found in the 1997 season are those of a church which was a predecessor of the contemporary chapel. Whether this was dedicated to Spanish martyrs is still an open-if tantalising-possibility." Epidauros. Asklepieion. In the course of fire prevention work in the sanctuary, a number of mostly R and ECh remains were located, including: a 4th-Ct BC well, built in isodomic masonry, NE of the ECh basilica; parts of three R buildings; foundations of a R wall in the NW part of the site; a further R wall to the E of the R baths, probably part of the latter; and a section of the anc. water supply system of the sanctuary, which was associated with a large cistern. No architectural remains were located to the N of the anc. site. (ADelt 96-7) Temple of Apollo Maleatas. B.K. Lambrinoudakes (AS) carried out conservation/restoration work on the LC altar. (Ergon 1997, 60-61). Old Epidauros. Within the limits of the archaeological zone, in the easternmost part of the Nesi peninsula, were excavated foundations of four houses dated to the 4th Ct BC and the HL period; it seems that the area was also inhabited during the R and EByz periods. One of the houses (III) was built in the polygonal style, and contained coins and jewellery, while the remains of the fourth house included a rectangular courtyard with an empty cistern (d: 0.75m, depth: 4-5m). It seems that similar houses were built over the whole area and were subsequently destroyed by intensive cultivation. The mod. earth road was built over the anc. road, which was originally lined with houses and cut by secondary roads. (ADelt 94-6) Midea. The Greek-Swedish excavations on the Myc acropolis of Midea, directed by Dr Katie Demakopoulou in collaboration with Prof. Paul Astr6m, were resumed in the summer of 1997. Dr Demakopoulou reports: "The excavations were conducted in three sectors in the interior of the acropolis: on the upper terraces of the E gate area, on the lower terraces of the NE area and on the lower terraces of the W gate area. The results were very important; the building complexes, which had been excavated in the previous seasons, were further uncovered. The interior of the acropolis now gives the appearance of a proper archaeological site with visible monuments, which along with the finds from the excavation place Midea in the same rank as the other two great Myc citadels in the Argolid: Mycenae and Tiryns. The Greek team continued the excavation in the W gate area, where a complex of rooms built on successive terraces, against the fortification wall, has been excavated since 1991. In 1995 rooms VIa and VIb were uncovered; they contained abundant LH IIIB2 pottery and other important finds, which include a complete large wheelmade terracotta female figure, obviously a goddess (cover illustration) and two objects inscribed in Linear B: a clay nodule, with a seal impression of a spider and, incised on the spider, the GRA ideogram (= wheat) and a storage stirrup jar, which bears the painted inscription wi-na-jo (Fig. 40). Room VII, which was partly excavated in 1996, was fully uncovered in 1997. The 1997 campaign brought to light four more rooms of the building complex (Fig. 41: from the NE). Two of them, rooms Vlla and VIIIb, which were probably basement rooms, were found on a lower terrace than the rest of the building and adjacent to the fortification wall. The other two rooms, IX and X, were found to the N on a higher level and are separated from the other rooms of the building by means of a corridor. The walls of the rooms were founded on the bedrock and have stone foundations with a superstruction of mudbricks; the floors are hewn in the bedrock and are covered with earth or pebbles on some uneven parts of the rock surface. The finds from the new rooms of the building complex were abundant. The most important and numerous finds, however, came from rooms VIlla and VIIIb. The floors of the two rooms were covered with a thick destruction layer which contained a large amount of clay vases, tools, and stone and lead vessels. The pottery belongs to three groups: fine decor- ated, fine undecorated and coarse ware with many household and storage vessels. It is dated to the second half of the 13th Ct BC (LH IIIB2) and it presents a great variety of types and shapes: jugs and juglets, stirrup jars, collar-necked jars, askoi, deep bowls, kraters, kylikes, cups and mugs, dippers, angular bowls, handmade miniature vases, cooking pots, basins, pithoi and other storage vessels. Two intact tripod stone mortars for grinding flour and other products were also found (Fig. 42), along with crushed lead vases, as well as lead clamps, which</page><page sequence="32">32 DAVID BLACKMAN ? ...... .. .. .... ... I\I: Fig. 40 iA Fig. 41 were used for the mending of broken clay vases. A great number of stone and bronze tools and other objects were recovered, such as millstones, grind-stones and pestles, bronze chisels, awls and needles, obsidian and flint blades, clay and steatite spindle-whorls and three bronze arrow-heads. There were also glass beads, two sealstones of steatite, human and animal terracotta figurines, fresco fragments and a large amount of ochre. Worthy of mention are some of the nearly complete vases found in room VII and outside of room VIIIa: two storage stirrup jars, a scuttle and a tall narrow-necked jug of very good quality (Fig. 43). All these finds indicate that the rooms were used as storerooms and workshops. Most of the rooms excavated this year were found destroyed by a great conflagration, simultaneous with a catastrophic Fig. 42 Fig. 43 earthquake, which struck Midea around the end of LH IIIB2. The wall of the rooms were found badly damaged and out of alignment as a result of the natural disaster." Mycenae. A special number of Exrtd H gpeS was devoted to the site on 31/3/98. Particularly useful is the article by E. Spathare on the conservation and presentation of the site. Nauplion. At the junction of Odos Asklepiou and Agiou Adrianou, opposite the Kyknos factory, investigations con- firmed the occupation of the E part of the mod. town in the EH II, Myc and Byz periods (pottery, foundations of a building). NE of Profetes Elias hill were discovered the foundations of a C/HL building. (ADelt 93-4) Speliotaki, anc. Elaious.

Dr Jeannette Fors6n (Swedish Institute at Athens) reports on work in 1997: "The Doric temple on top of Agios Elias (Fig. 44) was investigated in July 1997 under the direction of Dr Jeannette Fors6n for the Swedish Institute at Athens, in collaboration with Dr Bjorn Fors6n (Finnish Institute at Athens) and Prof. Erik Ostby (Norwegian Institute at Athens). In 1997 a large area was cleared of bushes and stones in order to make an accurate architectural drawing of the temple foundation. Additionally two trenches were made, one to the S of the temple and one to the E. The S trench was excavated down to bedrock, whereas lack of time prevented us from reaching bedrock in the E trench. More than 300 architectural blocks were found in the excavation. Most of these were transferred to Tegea Museum, where they will be studied and hopefully enable a full recon- struction of the temple as well as a more exact dating of it. An ash altar was found ca 10m to the E of the temple. This altar had clearly been used before the building of the Doric temple (ca 500 BC), as it contained many objects from the 7th- 6th Ct BC. This date indicates that an earlier temple might have existed at the site, oriented the same way as the temple of 500 BC; this is further supported by a large amount of EA tiles. A large quantity of votive offerings of bronze (Fig. 45), lead and iron, but also of terracotta and bone, were recovered Fig. 45</page><page sequence="34">34 DAVID BLACKMAN from the altar. Most of these votive offerings, as well as the pottery, date to the 7th-6th Ct BC and show a strong Lakonian influence. A few LG finds indicate that some cult activity on Agios Elias was already established in the late 8th Ct BC, although the main cult activity did not start until the 7th Ct when the first cult building was, we assume, erected at the site. The Slavic village, Kandreva, was founded in the 6th Ct AD around the Doric temple. The church of this village reused the temple foundations and several Med graves were found in the S trench under what used to be the church floor. The village was destroyed in the last decades of the 14th Ct AD, as evidenced by 8 Venetian coins found in the destruction layer." Lousoi. Dr Mitsopoulou-Leon reports on the work of the Austrian Institute in 1997: "Excavations took place E of the temple and investigation of the E building and the dense stone packing at the N edge of the temple terrace was continued. The stone packing, consisting of unworked blocks of limestone and rock, runs eastward from the NE comer of the temple (originally described as a 'pit') along the N edge of the temple plateau. Its upper surface lies about 2m below the level of the euthynteria of the temple of Artemis and reaches a depth of 1.50m at its NE corner. Above the stone packing lies a layer of clayey earth. As already assumed last year, the stone packing served to strengthen the terrain. Most of the finds from the stone packing and the superposed earth layer date from the late 8th to the late 6th Cts; some individual clay statuettes, however, may have existed into the 5th Ct, since the material was very fragmented and clearly displaced. Noteworthy among the finds are a double axe and fragments of two figure-of-eight fibulae of bone; bronze objects include the same type of fibulae, needles, rings, a spherical pendant and an omphalos bowl. Fragments of bg drinking bowls as well as cult vessels were also found. Among the clay statuettes are types which appear in Lousoi for the first time, for instance a figure vase in the shape of a ram. The complex is to be considered a closed deposit. The 'E building' is approximately rectangular, measuring ca 6.45 x 4.55m. The walls consist of alternate courses of boulders and limestone, bedded in clay or earth. Limestone slabs laid horizontally above irregular courses of boulders as a levelling layer provide stability. In contrast, in the W face of the building large limestone slabs above the foundation form a kind of euthynteria, on which lies another, narrower course of slabs which bonds eastward at the SW comer into the S wall. The rubble walling begins only about Im from the SW corner, which implies that there, too, the upper course of slabs carried on for at least 0.80m around the corner. The upper surface of the euthynteria slabs lies approximately at the level of the ground surface inside and outside the building. The terrain slopes strongly from S to N; to the N the foundations reach a height of about 1.20m. The building lies across the slope and opens towards the W over a narrow row of slabs, while the other sides are enclosed by the rubble walls. The difference in the wall thicknesses makes it most likely that they were no more than half the height of a building, forming an enclosure rather than a room. On the basis of the excavation details described above, we conclude that the 'E building' was possibly an altar. The difference between the surface level around the E building and that of the euthynteria of the later temple makes it probable that the altar belonged to an earlier building, which stood on a higher projection of the slope before it was levelled for the erection of the later temple. After the collapse of the building, a thick layer of clay, strongly mixed with fragments of large tiles, covered the remain- ing walls and the clay debris, providing a terminus ante quem for the destruction of the E building. Apart from the Cor statuettes of the Spes and Artemis type, which came to light earlier, and a fluted jug of the 2nd-half 5th Ct BC, new finds were a bronze hoop with a snake's head at one curving end and the middle part of a hand with four fingers, cut from bronze leaf, of A date." Partheni. Susan Petrakis and Christina Salowey (ASCS) report on the second season of the Partheni Topographical Survey in June 1997: "This year we returned to the topographical units which we had defined in 1996, in order to draw and photograph structures found at that time. These units are located on the 1:50,000 IGME map and on the 1:5,000 Greek Army maps. We continued the reconnaissance of sites and anc. remains along the W base of Mt Partheni. This area has become an important one in our project as we gather more information about the ancient Arcadia-Argolid border and the road described by Pausanias. The data collected from the investiga- tion of this area are summarized below. In the first few days of the season, we made measured drawings and detailed photographs of the stone cairnms identified in 1996. In the NE corner of the Partheni basin, along the base of Mt Partheni, we found outcroppings of limestone bedrock, some of which appeared to have been cut back, shaped or otherwise modified. These features are very weathered and we were unable to identify tool marks or other evidence of human activity. Further study was made of the wall in the Katavothra (see AR 1996-97, 35). When the terrain permitted, we walked measured transects at intervals of 20 to 35m, mapping structural remains, concen- trations of sherds, and other apparently cultural features which we then sketched and photographed. We did not collect archaeological material, but in some cases we photographed and drew profiles of feature sherds and other small finds, leaving them in situ. The features and structures which we located along the western base of Mt Partheni are as follows: (1) A wall fragment of coarse, polygonal construction at the SW tip of the hill of Vouno; (2) topographical indications of a road and possible dyke running roughly N-S along the W side of Vouno, at its base; (3) clearer indications of this road/route visible to the N of the mod. paved road which runs E-W along the N side of Vouno (including traces of road bed in some places); (4a &amp; 4b) concentrations of sherds (anc., Med and mod.) in two discrete areas near this section of road; at the more northerly of the two areas (4b) were architectural remains, including an anc. wall block and a small, corner triglyph block, both of marble; (5) traces of the road N of 4b up to the Ag. Vasileios ridge where, we concluded, it had been destroyed by postwar roadworks. However, we were able to hypothesize a connection with the stretch of anc. road bed running N-S along the W base of Mouchli (discovered in 1996); (6) spolia of marble and limestone built into a well head and some terrace walls on the W slope of Mt Partheni, to the E of Vouno. In our next season's work we hope to be able to fill in the gaps along the W slopes of Mt Partheni and to study areas 4 and 6 more intensively to determine whether these may be connected to sanctuaries mientioned by Pausanias." Tegea. E. Ostby (Norwegian Institute at Athens) reports on work in 1997: "Only some limited study activity, in preparation for a publication of the 1990-94 excavations, took place here in 1997. A survey project for the coming years is in preparation,</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 35 and an initial, limited field season is planned for the summer of 1998. This project will cover the entire urban area of anc. Tegea and its immediate surroundings, and will include botanical, geological and environmental components in addition to the purely archaeological ones." LAKONIA Alepochori-Geraki: Prote Kouveleike cave. In the report of the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology, E. Stravopodi gives an account of the second (1992) season here (the first season was in 1990). The cave has an outer and an inner chamber. In 1990 an infant was found buried in a pot, and grey sediment had been reached in some trenches in the outer chamber. In 1992, the latter was also discovered in other tests. The sloping natural floor of the cave was encountered at depths of up to 0.80m. Pottery was LN. Faunal remains included both wild and domesticated species, and there were many fish bones. Polished stone tools (chiefly small picks) were present, as was obsidian. Millstones were not uncommon, and there were scattered human bones. Entrance to the inner chamber was through a difficult, very low, narrow tunnel, 4m long. This made it impossible for all earth to be carried outside, so only a sample was sieved. The four trenches opened here had upper levels disturbed by badgers and rodents. Finds, especially animal bones, were sparser than in the outer chamber. Sherds were chiefly from LN pithoi. A circular stone structure of unknown purpose (diam. 0.25m) was found 1.55m below the surface, in an ashy level. The sloping natural floor of the cave began to appear at 1.10m below the surface in a test near the chamber wall. A search for other signs of occupation in the vicinity led to the discovery of another cave 50m away, with surface PR pottery. (ADelt 688-90) Amyklai. Anc. roads and one G tomb were located in the course of irrigation works E of the village. (ADelt 100) Areopolis: cave of 'Kalamakia'. The joint excavation of the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology, the Archae- ological Department of Athens University and the French School was continued in 1997: "The deposits in the cave date from before 80,000 until ca 40,000 and contain archaeological remains of the MPal period. In the highest level (level IV) a thick layer of stones was removed and also a circular stone construction which had been revealed from the preceding period. In the next level a settle- ment horizon was revealed which contained a relatively small number of remains. The bones are whole or slightly broken (some of them indeed were found separately but fit together) while the stones include tools and cores of great size, but very few by-products of the final form of the tools. These remains correspond to a very short period of Pal man, in contrast to the remains of all the preceding settlement horizons which repre- sent longer periods of occupation. Despite the different character of the settlement, the bone remains, like those of the preceding horizons, belong almost exclusively to deer and wild goats, while the stone tools are characteristic of the Mousterian period. At the lower level (the top of level III) sectors were excavated which belonged to several settlement horizons (an accurate number cannot be defined because of the strong compactness of the sediments). Included among the finds are a human tooth: the second molar of the lower jaw of a Neandertal man. At this level the bone remains belong chiefly - :...:. i-ii :i i:i-i~i:i-i:i-'i-i ..: i:i;ili-ii iiii,;.,,,: : :-i:::; ::: : : i. _:: _: :_ : :: : --- l:i:i.i:iii;i:i::' : - .-.._ ~:_:::_----::-::::--:- .:.: ?i:_?ii:-i-i:a.r.:i;:i-l?-:-:::-:-?:::-: ::l:::::i-l~-::?i:: ::::::: "':l:':_i:--:iil::?I:-~ iiijiiii:iilijiiii-i-c-?--ii::i::;? j:--i-ii ii:-ii ::iiiiiiiii~;ii~ii-i:ii'iii-ii-iii :::-:lii-:-l-:::::.;:- i~'a:::i::li:~ ,i:l::::i :: : .:. -:::::?:: i:::-:_::: .-- :i:?,iri'-i::i:i'iii--?ii-~~i.i:?-----~- -_1-:-:-_:-:::: -:iinit:i ijii- :-:-iii-:iiii iiiiii:ii.i:-: ~"::i;ii~i:i-i:i~: : ill: :i-i':iii?iii'iiilri:i~~:i:-i:-:-i:-:?:i ::-:?:?:-:?:?:??:?::::::? ::: : :: ::: :-'- i:i ?iiiiiiiiiii:i: . ::~';jli:~:i:-i:~I,-i .... i:i-i:-:::: ::_:i i _-i:. i iiiiiiii iiii:iii__iii_ :_:_i___i'i:iii-ii :i: :i:i?i?iiiii-s:ei ?i:?::::::::::'i;~:ijl-:aili:i':i"l:I: ::-::::i::2:: ::::::::: I'l:iiji:i::...::i::::::::i::ij-ii:~:;~j iii:isiiiiieiii:ii`-::lijji.8.~b-:iiil :~-:-j::-l:i: 4c'j?~j:~iz;l:?1:i:iii;iiiii::-i-- -:-:-:1-::::::i--:--::i::-?i-i:ii?i-:; ::::::-:::-:-: :;:::'-:I"~I~(BG? il~..i':~:B:i-i.S:iI:~:-1-:-:: ?:-:-::-:::::-::-:::--:- :::":.':.:-''---'--:--:---::-:I:: : : ::i_,:: _: :: : . : :;i:i i-r:-iiiiii:-i::i_:i---- i i: ::::::::::- il:i-li:i-':li'lii;i :I:i::ii:i X:r~ii:j- : . .:.-.-. :::j::j:::::-:::::::-?:?::--::i::::::?:- :::::':' ";~:"?'':~_:--.ci-~:I:iil':~u:?i'? ~?~r~i:il:ii?:a'is~iiii-iiiii'iiiiiiii aiiii-isi'?:is'iiiijaiiiii _:_:---::I:::::::-:_:;i"l:: ??.::???;i_-:_-~_:?::li~:Ei iiiii:iiii:iiiiiii'iiiiiiii iiii : : --: :i:i:-:i-i-i:i lii"i?i'ii:::?::: :::?:?:::::::i::iiii-::-:i'i'ii;iiii i-iii-i:i:iii;i-iiilii-:ii.:-?:-:::::?:: : : : :: :: : ' 'i.i:il iii-i: :i?i: -:l:i:::i:iii,-i-ii;:,i:i:iii-:i::l?il' ''':''''''':'-''':'''''''''''''-'''''''' i::'ii'i-ii:i~iiiii:ili-iii:: -::':::?:'::'-:-:-::::'''-'-:- -::"::: ::':::-:":-'-' ::---- :::' i:iiiiii~ii:i iiiiiiiiii ::,:::i::::;:::::::::::::::::ii::i:ii:i: -: -;- Y:l:-l-:i:_:::::,_- :I--: :::-' i ::::.:::_:.:::.::: ::::::::::::: : .. iiiii;iiii;iili:i:iiiiiiiiiii-i:i'ii:~i -;;-?:?n-j~:i~itii~8liflcs~,saa:--:i:l: :~~~:";~'i:l-~~?ifi'''~'~"~': ~~lii8-iiliiiJi:i~,Siiliiiijii:iiiiii:-: :~ar~:~ii:si?i-:i:~ii.:i a?::?i?l?:?-ilii-:-~1~5DI ?'?:"'W~---' ?:: Fig. 46 to wild goats and deer. The collection of samples for various analyses was con- tinued (palynological, micromorphological, radiochronological, etc.). It was confirmed that stalagmites have formed on different levels of the cave-a phenomenon which permits us to date them. This is important because the stalagmites are in fact the only material available for dating deposits of this period, which is outside the scope of the C14 method. The underwater survey was continued in order to locate underwater caves with Pal remains which have now been covered by the sea." Geraki (anc. Geronthrai). Joost Crouwel and Mieke Prent report on the work of the University of Amsterdam and the Netherlands Institute at the acropolis of Geraki: "After two seasons of intensive survey, the third campaign was for the main part dedicated to test excavations on the acropolis, within and outside the megalithic wall surrounding the summit (Fig. 46). In addition, a geomorphological study was carried out to gain a better understanding of the original appearance of the acropolis hill and to establish the degree of downslope movement of artefacts in recent and in past times. Work was also continued on the recording and study of the spolia incorporated in the various Med and later churches in and around Geraki. Summarizing the preliminary results of the test excavations in chronological order, two phases of EH construction were encountered in the undisturbed deeper layers on the summit of the acropolis. A section of a room of the second phase, which ended in a fire destruction in EH II, yielded in situ remains of a pithos. This still contained a large quantity of carbonized seed or grain and was surrounded by numerous clay fragments with seal impressions (Fig. 47). These fragments probably belonged to a clay band which had helped to seal the mouth of the pithos. Much more pottery was found of the type encoun- tered during the survey and then tentatively classed as LN or final N. This pottery, with a surface treatment of plastic 'smear marks' so far unparalleled elsewhere, may now more firmly be dated to EH II, in view of its association with standard ceramics of that period in the trial excavations. C-HL activities on the site appear to have involved the levelling of large areas within the acropolis wall, as intermedi- ate periods (MH, EIA and A) were represented only by small groups of sherds in pockets, wash levels, etc. No walls, pits or other structures belonging to these periods were encountered. The EIA potsherds included both PG and G pieces, the former not previously noted at the site.

At least two C-HL building phases were observed, but these were much disturbed by ploughing. The remains of one HL building contained a hoard of 54 coins, mostly of silver, but some of bronze (Fig. 48). The hoard was discovered in a layer which may represent a period of destruction or collapse. No traces were found of a pit in which the hoard would have been hidden. After the abandonment of this and other HL buildings, part of the summit was used as a burial ground for tile graves. None of the trial trenches yielded structural remains of the temple of Apollo mentioned by Pausanias. On the other hand, evidence was found for large-scale HL construction in relation to the acropolis wall. This involved different layers of stone fill topped by a thick layer of potsherds and tile. Of the test trenches dug outside the acropolis wall, none produced undisturbed archaeological strata." Gytheion. Part of an ECh wall was unearthed at the Sirimbak- os plot.(ADelt 110) Sparta. A total of 17 rescue excavations were reported in the mod. town of Sparta, the vast majority involving architectural remains of the R period. (ADelt 102-10) Substantial domestic remains were excavated at the Dedede- mos plot, including a number of rooms and a courtyard with drainage ditches, while at the Theodorakopoulos-Liokautos plots, a large R house was discovered, consisting of rooms arranged around a corridor, a section of a pipe with a vaulted roof, part of the R drainage system (also encountered at other points in the mod. town), as well as evidence of earlier workshop activities in the area (moulds). At the Polychronakou plot the excavation was continued of one of the R urban villas, with a decorated atrium (ADelt 35, 136-139), and a section of a R road leading to the acropolis and possibly joining the main street coming from the direction of the R stoa. Parts of two other R villas were investigated at the Provias plot: House A, including two rooms, yielded a rich collection of finds, typical of large villas in Sparta, as well as the base of a perirhanterion, a small Cor capital of red marble and a Doric capital. At the Tsoutouras plot was unearthed one side of an atrium, the interior of which originally included a garden, and other architectural remains to the N. _:.:..::: .-l~- - iii; i:... ...... i- i s i~-i --~ iii ... :_i;i f~:i ::f: Fig. 48 In the course of mod. drainage works in the N part of the acropolis, architectural remains were investigated, mostly of R date, including parts of large public buildings and some burials.

At Odos Agiou Nikonos, a section was unearthed of the</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 37 familiar roofed drainage system of R Sparta, as well as the remains of a stylobate with Ionic column bases, possibly part of an interior atrium, to its S. A large bath-house was investigated at Odos Artemidos Orthias, where other similar buildings were discovered in the past (ADelt 24, 137; 36, 121). A large, possibly subterranean construction, roofed with a cylindrical, tholos roof, was unearthed at Odos Leonidou; a large unfluted column, with a funerary inscription, in secondary use, was located in the middle of the chamber. More fragmentary architectural remains of the LHL and R period were recorded at other parts of the mod. town. In the Limnes area (Patistas plot), in the vicinity of a shrine, were excavated domestic architectural remains of many phases, dating from the G to the R period. A HL house was investigated near the acropolis, with a LR tomb in the N part of the plot. At the Asemakopoulou plot, remains of the ECh period were identified: the continuation of a large public building, partly excavated in 1983, whose interior was divided into a number of long aisles decorated with mosaic floors, quite atypical of a dromic basilica; the mosaics included both geometric and floral motifs in bands, with figured representa- tions in the centre. Two shallow cisterns, surrounded by a ditch, mark an interior atrium in the same area. Part of a MByz building was discovered at the Zavras plot, while at Odos Kleombrotou was excavated the N continuation of a large ECh building; at the same site part of an ECh cemetery was investigated. (ADelt 24, 135-137; 28, 168-170) Magoula. Part of a farmhouse excavated at the Aeras hill, 4km from Sparta, confirms the existence of a network of such establishments in the country around the anc. town. (ADelt 110) Theatre. The first of the two seasons of a third phase of BSA excavations in the vicinity of the ancient theatre of Sparta took place in August-September 1997 under the direction of Professors G.B. Waywell and J.J. Wilkes (University of London). They report: "The 1997 excavation consisted of a single trench (ST 97 XV) measuring overall 15m N-S and 5m E-W (on the excava- tion grid between 505 and 520 and 615 and 620) across the line of the W parodos ca 18m from the front line of the cavea, at the point where the marble casing of its retaining wall ceases and the line of the wall projects ca 3.5m to the S. Within the N part of the trench lay the E wall of a Roman nymphaeum, explored in the final season of the BSA excava- tions (1927) under the then director A.M. Woodward and published in the Annual for that year (BSA 29, 1-56). The purpose of the 1997 excavation was to obtain new evidence that might end the continuing uncertainty regarding the nature and design of the original stage arrangements of the Sparta theatre at the time of its construction ca 20 BC. During excavation of the stage area (1924-1925) Woodward identified two E-W parallel lines of poros blocks, running beneath the walls of the later stage building, resting directly on the natural orange gravel and set ca 5.25m apart, as the remains of the first stage (the two lines are indicated on the plan of De Jong and designated C-C (N line) and CC-CC (S line) published in BSA 27). The rear (S) line of blocks was found to continue westwards out of the stage area into the W parodos, while at the W end of the front (N) line two blocks of conglomerate stone, clamped together and with U-shaped runnels in their upper surfaces, were located resting upon the line of poros blocks. They appear to be in situ and were identified by W. Dorpfeld, following a visit to the site, as possible indications of a moveable stage which could be drawn aside on rollers into the W parodos out of the sight of spectators. Many similar .i...... an.e ........ Fig. 49 channel blocks are now visible re-used in the rear wall of the later stage building. Though that interpretation was not accepted by Woodward (BSA 27, 190-191), the notion was given plausible elaboration by Henrich Bulle (Abh. Bayer. Akad. Wiss. Bd. 33, 1928), who followed this up in 1935 with test excavations in the area of Woodward's excavations in the W parodos where the remains of the nymphaeum permitted (Das Theater zu Sparta, Munich 1937). A trench along the E side of the latter revealed two channel blocks in situ on the front (N) line (C-C) and a second line of channel blocks ca 2m to the S, with a single block, also in situ and set on a poros foundation, which belonged to the larger size of block (0.48m high) compared with the smaller blocks (0.29m high) on the front (N) line. Both lines of channel blocks appeared to continue westwards below the foundation of the nymphaeum. Bulle was unable to locate the south line of blocks (CC-CC) since that lay beyond the limit of Woodward's excavation of the nymphaeum, which had removed more than 3m of later overburden from the area. Remains of poros foundation blocks were also noted in the area W of the nymphaeum. All traces of Bulle's third line of blocks were evidently removed from the area of the later stage building by construction on the same line of the wall of the scaenae frons. The 1997 trench, which was placed deliberately to include the area E of the nymphaeum explored by Bulle, presented two very different levels of excavation: in the N lay the exposed remains of the nymphaeum and the lower courses and footings of the cavea retaining wall revealed by Woodward in 1927; in the S lay an area of unexcavated ground at a level ca 2 to 2.5m higher. As a result in the N part the work consisted of removing modern surface deposits, cutting back the line of Woodward's excavation to a vertical section on the E side, re- excavation of Bulle's 1935 trench and the excavation of some undisturbed R levels to reveal the lowest marble courses and poros footings of the cavea wall. In the S area of the trench the excavation of undisturbed ground revealed well-preserved remains of medieval buildings above the robbing and demoli- tion levels of the nymphaeum and associated structures. The discoveries made in 1997 may be summarised thus: Northern (lower) area of the trench (ST 97 XV): (1) At the N end of the trench four courses of marble facing of the cavea retaining wall were revealed: these were the great torus moulding (0.5m high), set above three stepped courses which diminished in height from top to bottom (0.29, 0.25 and 0.23m), and which rested directly upon at least one course of roughly dressed poros blocks (Fig. 49).</page><page sequence="38">38 DAVID BLACKMAN Elm" too ..................

Though structurally secondary to the construction of the latter, from the fills of their respective construction trenches it appears likely that this wall represents part of the original arrangements in this area of the W parodos. (3) Bulle's 1935 trench along the outer face of the E wall of the nymphaeum (0.75 to 1.25m wide) was excavated to its depth of ca 1.4m below the existing ground level. It com- menced at the S face of the E-W wall noted above (2) and continued Swards for ca 5m to the limit of Woodward's excavation. (4) As anticipated, the two clamped channel-blocks recorded by Bulle on the line C-C were revealed, ca 0.25m S of the E- W wall (2 above). They were confirmed to be in situ resting on poros foundations, while the level and the line of the channels were found to correspond exactly both to those of the two channel-blocks at the W end of C-C, described above, and also to those of the fragment of a single channel block at the E end of the stage area, excavated by Woodward and re-excavated and recorded in 1995 (Fig. 50 shows (4) and (5) from the E). (5) Bulle's 'third line' of channel blocks was revealed as the single block resting on a poros foundation 2m further S (measured from the centre of each channel). As with the other (4 above) the block was found to continue westwards into the nymphaeum foundations. (6) The only excavation of undisturbed levels in the N area of the trench was an area of ca I m square where the corner of Woodward's excavation on the E side was cut back, partly for reasons of safety and partly to obtain a section aligned with the rest of the trench. In this small area there was observed an intrusive cut, probably of late R date, in which at least three moulded square marble bases (c. 0.5m) had been stacked one above the other, for some purpose that is as yet not clear. Southern (upper) area of trench (ST 97 XV) (Fig. 51): (7) The curving face of Woodward's excavation which divided the lower and upper levels of the trench was cut back to serve as a control on the excavations of the upper levels which lay beyond. (8) Topsoil and recent deposits were removed over the full extent of the trench to a depth of ca 1.5m, at which level the excavation area was reduced to a width of 3m, mainly to facilitate soil removal. (9) The metalling of a Med street, with a width of at least 3m, was found to run E-W across the S end of the trench. (10) The N wall and threshold-block of a doorway belong- ing to a building of uncertain character facing onto the street were revealed, incorporating two orthostats which may prove to belong to an earlier structure, and a short section of mor- tared wall which may prove to be of late R date. Within the building a floor of stone flags incorporated fragments of at least two shallow stone basins (ca 1.2m diameter) of the type often found in the cold rooms of R baths and which may have been robbed from the adjacent nymphaeum. The interior of the building, which associated pottery dates to the medieval period (1 th-13th Cts), was partitioned by a N-S wall constructed on the line of another mortared wall that may also prove to be of late R date. (11) The Med stone floor was removed to reveal a destruc- tion deposit of mortar fragments, roof tiles, and bricks (some with stamps) which resulted from the robbing, though not necessarily the original demolition, of the nymphaeum. Two small excavations were also undertaken along the outer (W) face of the late R defence wall, within the trench cut during the 1906 excavations (BSA 12, 394-406): (1) in ST 97 XVI the two poros bedding blocks on Bulle's 'third line' of channel blocks were located continuing beneath foundations of the late R wall. This confirmed Bulle's conclusion that a third line had originally run across the width of the stage area but had evidently been entirely removed or obscured during construction of the back wall of the scaenae frons. (2) In ST 97 XVII at a point ca 3m further to the S the two poros blocks, already recorded by Woodward, which continued the line CC-CC below the late R wall and westwards into the parodos, were revealed and recorded. In 1998 it is planned to complete the excavation of ST 97 XV, in order to reveal more of the lines of channel blocks, to complete the excavation and removal of Med levels in the S of the trench, to investigate the history of the area in the MR and LR periods, and to reveal any traces of conglomerate blocks and their poros bedding on the line CC-CC, partly in order to test the hypothesis of Bulle that the conglomerate blocks on this line were not channelled (two unchannelled blocks are incorporated in the foundation plinth of the rear wall of the W stage room). If time and conditions allow, test excavations will be undertaken beyond the W end of the nymphaeum, already probed by Bulle, to seek evidence for any westward continu- ation of the channel blocks or their poros bedding."</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 39 4pIIiI7 ? , ?v+*n ? + Li?- ob . - nma a Azmm. feffal -- ........-- ,_._-, __.--..'__ - .. ..... -...... ....-.....-.. . - ---- -  - - Fig. 52 ACHAIA Aigeira. The work of the Austrian Institute continued in 1997 under the direction of A. Bammer, who reports: "Excavations: soundings were dug in the Solonas area on the W slope of the acropolis. A cutting was made (20m long and 1.5m wide) on the slope and perpendicular to it. On the survey grid its orientation lies parallel to the axis of the geodetic point on the acropolis, in the direction of Agios Georgios. Two walls and a pit with many loom-weights were discovered. Soundings were made above the naiskoi A, B and C, discovered by O. Walter in the area of the theatre. The soundings were not concluded, but at present no remains of naiskos walls as seen by Walter were found. In the area of the low-lying terrace on the Kypina plot foundations, partially visible on the surface, were examined. Several halls were found perpendicular to one another; they clearly lay around a courtyard. On the E side a row of large rooms was built on. Geodetic surveys of the areas investigated and the excava- tions were carried out. It is noteworthy that the so-called 'Tycheion' does not lie exactly in the Hippodamic grid of the town. A survey of the S slope of the acropolis was started. Water supply: the water conduit identified last year, which was laid from the mountains in the Flovoka direction to the town, was further investigated. It turned out that not one, but several superposed conduits (four altogether), dating from the A to the Byz periods, were identified. In addition, a tunnel was found, which carried the water channels right through the hill. Ethno-archaeological documentation of the raisin pickers' houses continued: U. Muss drew further plans of these houses and produced a sketch plan of the houses of Palaeologika. During demolition of one house, because of its ruinous state, the spolia were salvaged and taken to the dig house. Fragments of winding simai were transferred to the museum of Aigion." Aigialeia. The church of Ag. Nikolaos was studied for publica- tion. It is a domed(?), inscribed-cross church with a tripartite sanctuary, the middle semi-circular apse being double the size of the side apses. There is no narthex (See 16o Egnu0ato Bvuavrtvij; Koat MratfaoavvftVl Apxatokoyta; Koat TtXvrln, Christian Archaeological Society, Athens 1996, 43). Aigion. At the junction of Odos Kanellopoulou and Souliote fragmentary remains were identified of HL and R architectural complexes, including part of a paved floor, associated with a HL workshop nearby (ADelt 38, 125). At Odos Londou 29 a section of a R bath was excavated, of rectangular plan with a subterranean construction in the centre.

Soter report on the 1997 season: "The two methods used in the investigations for the location of anc. Elike, during the seventh season of work in the area, were drilling bore-holes and a magnetometer survey of the area. A total of 14 bore-holes were made, to an average depth of 18m, at various points in the communities of Elike, Temene, Rizomylos, Nikolaiika, Elaionas and Zachloritika (Fig. 53: map of the Selinous-Kerynites area, showing the bore-holes and sites R1-R2). Three were conducted for the first time in the area between Elaionas and Zachloritika (B47-49) (Fig. 54: map of bore-holes between Zachloritika and Ag. Tryphonas). The results indicate that a denser network of bore-holes should be made over the whole area, especially considering that the findings suggest the occurrence of geological changes similar to those observed in the zone Elike-Rizomylos-Nikolaiika, all of which agree with the descriptions in anc. sources, concern- ing the destructive phenomenon of 373 BC. The remaining 11 drillings (B50-B60) in the zone between Kerynites and Selinous, as well as in the vicinity of Elike, Rizomylos and Nikolaiika, brought to light much new evi- dence, both geological and archaeological, thus confirming impressively the existence of anc. horizons and ruins buried under the alluvial deposits. All but one (B59) of the drillings yielded pottery sherds, fragments of tiles and glass and remains of walls. The drillings in the area of modern Elike (B52) also yielded sherds of bf vases, of the C period, while HL sherds were identified at Rizomylos (B51). The great number of sherds in the area covers the period from C to R times. On the whole, the 1997 drillings demonstrated the existence of a barren horizon separating the two main habitation phases, as was suggested from earlier investigations. But they also showed that the C and earlier horizons were not always at 4- 12m depth with the R horizon above, but at some points started much higher up (5th-Ct bf sherds were discovered at a depth of 1.5-2m in the Elike zone). This new evidence calls for study with a denser network of bore-holes. The magnetometer survey at selected points in the same area led to the location of new sites at Langades and Ag. Apostoloi and Partes Nikolaiikon, as well as at Nesia Temenes, in the Elike-Temene communities. The most impressive results come from the sites of Langades and Ag. Apostoloi Nikolai- ikon, which should be excavated in the future. The area of Ag. Tryphonas Elaiona, where a strong presence of geomagnetic anomalies was identified in preliminary tests, should also be investigated systematically next season. The shallow check drillings at sites RI (Palies Rodies) and R2 (Partes) Nikolaiikon (see Fig. 53), in combination with a small trial trench in the first case, were extremely successful. At RI, at a depth of 2m from the original surface, a strong wall was discovered, 0.80m thick and surviving 1.50m in height. The position of the wall, ca 500m from the shore, the well-built masonry and its preserved length (at least 40m have been detected with the geo-radar), invite excavation in the future. At R2, four shallow drillings were conducted at four targets located in 1996 with the geo-radar and magnetometer; the targets were found to correspond to anc. buried objects (tiles, bricks) and remains of walls. An important find in one of the drillings, at a depth of ca 1,. 10m from the surface, was an anc. stone wall, on the top of which was discovered a sizeable fragment of clay architectural sculpture, of the A period, possibly part of the hair of a Sphinx or Gorgon. This is the first archaeological piece of evidence for the existence of an A settlement in the area of Nikolaiika and should be further investigated by excavation." Kalabryta. The excavations at the site of anc. Kleitor con- tinued with the investigation of the fortifications (SW gate) and of the anc. theatre, the latter being too disturbed to yield any meaningful results. It seems that the external gateway was built wide enough for the passage of chariots (3m wide), while the internal gate was originally designed with three openings. In the course of the extensive irrigation program for the Aroanio valley, rescue excavations identified important landmarks of the topography of the anc. city, including: the C cemetery outside the fortifications (pithos burials); a burial peribolos and part of a funerary road of the 5th-2nd Cts BC, S of Frangokklesi; a HL-R building complex; a typical example of a farmhouse in the area of Agios Petros, SW of the anc. city; part of another R farm to the NE of the anc. city; sections of the W gate; the fortification peribolos; buildings and tombs by the river Karnesios; and finally, part of a pottery kiln of C- HL date and remains of a cemetery in the Filomates area, NE of the mod. town.

C,~ Fig. 54 Kastria: Limnon cave (9km SSE of Kalavryta). An account of a new investigation here is given in the report of the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology. The cave, which is at a height of 900m, just N of the village, was investigated briefly 30 years ago and yielded PR sherds. An illegal excavation at that period had uncovered fossilised bones of hippopotamos, deer and goat dating to M Pleistocene. In 1992, two tests were laid out. In test A, in the chamber, upper levels contained HL and C sherds. Below these was a stratum with much Myc pottery, plus parts of two human skeletons. This covered a level with a few EH II sherds, after which came successive N floors with burning and ash. This stratum was ca im thick; finds indicated a late LN I date. Below this were clayey deposits without finds, representing a long period when the cave had been inundated. Below the clay was a thin stratum with MN pottery. Work ceased 4m below the surface. In test B, in the entrance, the upper level again had HL pottery, but immediately below this was late LN I material. Amongst the latter were large pieces of unbaked clay, some with holes; these probably came from a kiln floor. Within the N strata was a burial: a skeleton lying extended on its back, with stones forming a border round it (Fig. 55). The sherds in both tests came mainly from large storage vessels with rope or other plastic decoration. There were indications that they could have been locally made. Surface survey in the same district as the cave located four more N sites, of which the Kastro near the cave appeared to have been a small permanent N settlement; there were also signs of EBA and MBA habitation here.

A total of 18 rescue excavations were reported for the city of Patras, the vast majority consisting of R/LR and LByz architectural or funerary remains. (ADelt 129-39) The domestic architectural remains include parts of build- ings with mosaic floors, decorated with geometric motifs, a very common theme in the R city, clay or stone-built drain pipes and cisterns. The remains of a mosaic floor at the junction of Odos Hephaistou 13 and Elia Meniate (Fig. 56), preserved an inscription in the centre, with the signature of the artist in black letters on a white background (OIKONOMON- MEAIlN-PHOOETHCANTA-KATACKEYACANTA).

The main chamber was decorated with a mosaic floor in the centre of the room (Fig. 58) while five cist tombs, with plastered walls, were arranged around it, below floor level.

Finally, part of the S cemetery was located at Odos Asemake Fotila 16-18, where a total of 29 tombs were excavated: 16 of these were built cists, arranged in rows, including seven examples of the Ch era, surrounded by a peribolos wall; the remaining 13 (9 tile-roofed tombs, 4 cists) belong to the R period. Two Myc chamber tombs, part of a known cemetery (ADelt 33, 79; 36, 160; 40, 116-118), were excavated under remains of Byz and R date, at Odos Germanou 148-152. The chambers were square and rectangular in plan, containing 9-10 burials each, and were dated to the LH IIIA-C and LH IIIA2-LH IIIB/C periods, respectively. Tsoukaleika. The remains of a cistern discovered S of the church were probably part of the workshop areas of a R farmhouse located in the vicinity. (ADelt 143) Voudene. One more chamber tomb of LH IIIC date was excavated in the Myc cemetery. The dromos, 9m long, with converging walls, was disturbed by a perpendicular LR tile- roofed tomb. The entrance to the main chamber, circular in plan, was blocked with stones, while the roof itself was intact. One out of the four primary burials was originally placed in a thin layer of clay, a usual practice in this cemetery. (ADelt 140-1) AITOLIA-AKARNANIA Chalkis. The Greek-Danish archaeological cooperation project carried out its third campaign, under the direction of L. Kolonas, Head of the 6th Ephorate of PR and C antiquities, and Soren Dietz, Director of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. Soren Dietz and Sanne Houby-Nielsen report: "1997 was the second year of excavation on the hill named after its large Byz basilica, Hagia Triada (Fig. 59). The hill lies between the two mountains Klokova and Varassova, in antiquity called Mt Taphiassos and Mt Chalkis, directly by the sea opposite Patras. On account of the description given by Thucydides, Polybius and Strabo, the hill with its rich settle- ment traces can safely be identified as Aitolian Chalkis. The urban survey carried out in 1995 proved, however, that the extensive fortified area, known as Pangali or Kastro on the E side of the Varassova, was not used for long-term habitation and cannot be the site of the settlement Chalkis, as was previously thought. In 1997, the excavation began with further cleaning of the area ca 150m long and 30m wide immediately below the Byz fortification wall encircling the upper plateau of the hill. In 1995 and 1996 it was verified that the Byz wall lies on top of an earlier, C circuit wall, immediately inside and outside of</page><page sequence="44">44 DAVID BLACKMAN which C house remains were found. The removal of the fallen Byz rubble in this area revealed the outer-facing wall of the C circuit wall running at a distance of ca 1 m (in places consider- ably more) from the Byz wall. After these initial cleaning procedures, two 10 x 15m excavation units were laid out outside the Byz wall and covering the C circuit wall. In addition, two long, Im wide trial trenches were laid out. One of these was almost 100m long and cut across an upper plateau of the hill running N-S towards the Byz wall and continued outside the Byz wall further towards the N, cutting across those partly visible wall structures which encircle the hill at its lowermost levels. The second trial trench was 40m long and was opened immediately outside the Byz fortification wall, running NE-SW. Apart from the immediate hope of locating anc. settlement areas on the hill, the purpose of these trial trenches was to get a general impression of the state of preservation and the extent of cultural layers on the hill in terms of the presumed clearance activity in Byz times. In the 100m long trial trench (with unexcavated intervals) cutting across the middle part of the hill inside the Byz wall, bedrock was reached very soon. Below topsoil, traces from the use of the hill as a modem campsite were found resting on bedrock, while further towards the N a couple of thin layers contained mainly Byz sherds and tiles. Further again towards the N, scanty remains of foundation walls were found, probably dating to the Byz period. At the N end of the trench terminat- ing at the Byz wall, the stratigraphy increased significantly and bedrock was not reached. It seems to be the foundation trench of the Byz wall, filled with remains from the C circuit wall and Byz settlement. In general the trench confirmed that the settlement remains belonging to the A and C city and possibly even PR settlement had been cleared away in Byz times. The extension of this trial trench outside the Byz wall ran across the lowermost part of the hill and reached the valley, cutting across several walls running approximately E-W. They turned out to be rather poorly built stone walls, consisting mostly of roughly hewn blocks of conglomerate, and had the appearance of terrace walls resting on the sloping bedrock. A couple of thick layers, becoming thinner towards the valley, seemed to consist mainly of material which had slipped down from above. Thus, a large amount of small and very worn sherds and tiles of various dates were excavated, the majority of which dated to the A, C, HL and Byz periods. Among the more important finds were a large number of loomweights (as in previous years) and a LC or EHL terracotta head from a female statuette, as well as a C lamp fragment. The second trial trench, the one issuing from the Byz wall and running towards the NE, cut across the C circuit wall. The trench proved the Byz wall to have been constructed up against the stonefill of the C circuit wall. Accordingly, no foundation trench for the Byz wall was found on this side of the wall. Underneath the fill of the C wall, right on top of the bedrock, two thin and uncontaminated PR layers were found, belonging probably to the EH I period. Thus several diagnostic sherds were excavated among burned stones and large pieces of charcoal. Immediately outside, that is N of the C circuit wall, the lower part of a stone-built wall was excavated which was covered with plaster on the inside (N side). Thin settlement layers on top of bedrock belonging to this wall seems to point to a date in the 4th or early 3rd Ct BC. Towards the N end of the trench, a huge, well-built wall of large, hewn limestone blocks was found running approx. E-W. It has so far been traced for about 30m and thus is likely to stem from a public building, which is aligned with the C circuit wall, like the plastered wall mentioned above. One of the more interesting small finds from this trench was an amphora handle with a stamp: Nikostratos endymai. Both of the 10m x 15m excavation units yielded very promising remains of houses with undisturbed floor-levels. The N unit was covered with a thick layer of large rubble stones stemming from the Byz wall, so excavation was extremely laborious and was not finished. Nevertheless, the remains of a house built in drystone technique and in alignment with the C circuit wall were traced. Along one wall of the house ran a substantial drain built of slabstones and tiles. Inside and outside the house, the destruction layer of the house consisted of large areas of broken tiles, the 'falling pattern' of which was found in situ. In this destruction level was found an unfinished four- spouted marble lamp. In the S unit, remains of a rather similar house were found, again in alignment with the C circuit wall. The back wall of the house was preserved to a height of well over I m, built up against the rock which had been cut to receive it. Inside the house and in the small adjoining room was found a destruction layer similar to that in the N unit. Intermixed with the broken tiles, and spread over a large part of the house, were among other things large sherds from the same lid, plate and skyphos, giving the impression that they had fallen from an upper story or shelf. Many bronze items were also found, such as a knife and several fishing-hooks and coins. One stray find deserves special mention: part of terracotta sima with painted palmette decoration, which represents a type of architectural decoration known not least from 4th-Ct temple architecture. The piece appears to have been built into the Byz fortification wall. Geologist Kaj Strand continued his search for the anc. harbour of Chalkis. Test drillings made E of the hill excluded the possibility of an harbour in this area, while similar tests made W of the hill gave evidence for marine layers, the dating of which has not yet been completed. Work continued on registering the extremely rich LN finds which were made on the Pangali in 1996. In conclusion, the general impression after the 1997 campaign is that the Hagia Triada hill was fairly densely inhabited in C and EHL times outside the C circuit wall, in a 20-30m wide section running along the circuit wall on its N and NW side. The houses were aligned with this wall, as was one larger, probably public building. The habitation appears to have been abandoned in the EHL period. Inside the C circuit wall, C house remains were excavated in 1996 in the NW area. The E side of the hill inside the C circuit wall appears from the trial trench made in 1997 to have been cleared of earlier settlement remains in Byz times. Ceramic finds, mostly from mixed layers, point to an extensive settlement in the A and probably also in the G period, and certainly in PR times. The top of the hill occupied by the Byz basilica was probably the site of a C temple, but more secure evidence is still needed. The harbour of Chalkis, referred to by Thucydides, Polybius and others, was probably situated to the W of the hill." Mesolongi. At the site of Gabalou, in the general area of anc. Trichonion, part of a rectangular building was excavated within a large peribolos wall, which, judging by the inscrip- tions and dedications, was probably a temple of Asklepios.

K Fig. 60 style, was ex:cavated at the junction of Odos Th. Nova and Athenon, in the vicinity of other sections of the fortification system (ADelt 43, 174; 31, 166); against the N side of the walls were built buttresses, founded on a layer of pebbles. In the W part of the plot sections of two clay pipes were dis- covered, running parallel to the fortifications. (ADelt 149-51) In the area of Alonaki, which was apparently used as a cemetery (ADelt 26, 319; 28, 391), two HL tombs were investigated and architectural remains, probably of the same period. Finally, at N. Angelopoulou plot, the corner of a possibly public HL building was excavated, while at Leoforos Athenon 67 the remains of a LR workshop were located. Pipes and walls of the C, HL, R and Byz periods were discovered at various points in the mod. town. (ADelt 151-2) Oiniadae. Earthquake activities caused the collapse of part of the wall built over the E wall of the anc. shipsheds, as well as part of the polygonal fortification walls. The third season of systematic excavations in the shipsheds of the anc. town was focused on the area of the storehouse, on the N side of the complex, unearthing the northernmost (6th) ramp used for slipping the ships (ADelt 46, 164-166; AR 1996- 97, 43; Fig. 60). The quantity of fine pottery and small finds in this section (bronze and bone objects, coins, idols) confirms last year's suggestion that this area was in later times used as a ritual pit, connected with a sanctuary to the N. In the W part of the complex, the deposits covering the rock-cuttings used for drawing up the ships on the ramps were removed. Two R tile- roofed tombs near the storehouse and three over the slips provide a terminus ante quem for the use of the shipsheds. (ADelt 148) Anc. Stratos. Systematic excavations of public buildings in the W part of the anc. agora were continued for a third year. In the NE part of the agora were excavated the remains of the Bouleuterion, a four-sided roofed amphitheatral building. The excavation of the cavea and the drainage system surrounding the orchestra of the anc. theatre was completed. (ADelt 146-7) Territory of Stratos. This year the systematic surface survey was continued of ca 3000 stremmata of land surround- ing the anc.

The results, illustrating the continuous habitation of the area from PR times (flint work- shops in the valley of the Lepenous), through the A period (tiles from a temple at Spathare), to the C, HL and R times (pottery, remains of farmhouses), including the foundations of an ECh basilica, suggest the existence of the same type of</page><page sequence="46">46 DAVID BLACKMAN '-t8~" -/---, // " , / , itll o OO, K\b~i ;ps.e . ?: ! ,: , ,] r. .

Papapostolou reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (51-54): test trenches were dug in the area of the Apollo temple and of megara A and B. The W wall of megaron B was apparently interrupted by built cists, which after the destruction of the building had been used for cult purposes. Inside the NW corner of the Apollo temple, part of a building, already excavated by K. Romaios, was proved to be contemporary with megaron B, as Romaios had suggested. One of the 'bases of the elliptical peristasis' of megaron B was found insitu above the destruction level of megaron B. Finally, in megaron A, the S part of its E wall and the dividing wall of the anteroom were revealed, where a floor layer was recorded, with artificial cuttings in the bedrock. It seems that by the time megaron A was built, megaron B had already been destroyed. KEPHALLENIA Tzannata Porou. A large royal Myc tholos tomb of LH IIIA date was partly excavated at the site of Bozzi, an ideal location for an extensive Myc settlement, naturally protected, with rich agricultural land and a good harbour (Poros), possibly a stop- over on the route to the Ionian Sea and the Adriatic. The tholos tomb (d: 6.80; ht: 3.95m) was cut in the S slope of Bozzi hill, with a N-S orientation, and provided with only a basic dromos, Fig. 62 added at a subsequent date; it had a long roofed entrance and was perfectly preserved on the interior. The doorway was originally blocked by a stone wall. The corbelled roof, built with local stone in pseudo-isodomic masonry, has collapsed (16 courses in situ), and the tomb itself, which was extensively looted, included finds ranging in date from the Myc to the HL period, when it was probably the site of a hero cult (Fig. 61). The chamber contained three burial cists; the central one, with the remains of the dead ruler, contained two sealstones, a small bronze axe, two gold rosettes, a gold argonaut plaque, fragments of gold bands and many gold and glass paste beads in a small undisturbed section below the floor of the cist. A large pithos in the W part of the chamber, containing the contracted remains of a primary adult burial, date to the SMyc or PG period. The third looted cist was discovered partly under the pithos, with sherds of the end of the Myc period. A peribolos of unworked stones surrounded the tomb. (ADelt 154-7) ELEIA Agia Triada. Olymbia Vikatou reports on excavations in the Myc cemetery: "In NE Eleia between the villages of Panopoulos and Agia Triada, in the area called Palioboukouvina (Fig. 62), the 7th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities, in different excavation seasons from 1990 to 1997, studied the extensive Myc cem- etery of chamber tombs. In all 50 tombs have been found which contained most important finds. Above the dromoi of the chamber tombs were cist graves, which form part of the Ch cemetery of Palioboukouvina (that is, of the old village that was there). Also, a few graves were found that dated to the HL period. The site was occupied in the third phase of the Myc period (LH IIIA-C), in the HL period (the finds date to the 3rd Ct BC) and finally in the Ch period. Handmade pottery of the EByz period (7th Ct) was found, while the oral information of the old people of the area maintains that in this place there was a small village up to the last century. The most important period for this area, of course, is the Myc, when a large, fairly rich settlement developed, with a high standard of living. About 450-500 pots have been found, all well preserved. The commonest shape is the stirrup jar with ca 150 examples (Fig. 63). Then follow alabastra, piriform jars, large two-</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 47 Fig. 63 Fig. 64 handled and four-handled amphoras (Fig. 64), cups and small cups, lekythoi and lekythia, round pitharia without handles, amphoriskoi, ring-vases, goblets, compound vases, one kalathos and one feeding-bottle. Also found were two new types of pottery. The pots were decorated with various motifs, such as flowers, arcs, net, leaf-shaped bands, and so on. Pictorial scenes are few; the most important is the representation of the laying out of the dead that survives on the sherds of a krater. The dead person is shown lying on the death-bed in the middle of the representation, and to right and left of the bed are mourners, a priest performing a liturgical dance, and an animal which is probably about to be sacrificed. The sherds with this Fig. 65 scene are one of the most important finds from the cemetery, since on one hand they give us a good deal of information about the ritual of burial and the mourning of the dead, and on the other it is a rare pictorial theme of the Myc period (of the LH IIIC middle period) that is a precursor of the great pictorial scenes of the G period that treat the same theme, with differing rendering of the forms. About 1500 small finds come from the cemetery. The most important are: 2 bronze fibulae, about 60 stone and clay whorls, 3 bronze and 3 bone pins, 6 leaf-shaped razors and 4 with curving blades, 2 bronze rings, about 1000 beads of different forms (of sard, faience and gold), a gold amulet and one of rock crystal in the form of a pot, one gold necklace, 2 styli, 13 seal-stones, 8 bronze knives, 5 spear-heads (Fig. 65), some boars' tusks coming from a helmet, a sword (Fig. 66), 2 bronze tools, one stone mould to make jewellery, etc. The cemetery of Agia Triada was used from the start of LH</page><page sequence="48">48 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 66 IIIA to the end of LH IIIC. As the finds show, there were close relations between the area and the great Myc centres, mainly however with Achaia, as may be discerned from the great similarity of the pottery. The location of the cemetery and also the finds suggest the existence of some big settlement. Future excavation and comparative study, in combination with the study of the anthropological material, will give many important details for the study of mountainous Eleia, an area almost unknown up to now, but one which is proving to be rather important." Renewed illegal activities in the Myc cemetery prompted the excavation of a total of 22 chamber tombs, dated to the LH IIIA-C period. A number of Ch cist tombs were cut perpen- dicularly to the dromoi of the Myc tombs. The finds from the Myc burials include a golden amulet, remnants of a linen cloth covering the mouth of a large amphora, worked boars' tusks, faience and glass beads, a bronze diadem and an abundance of pottery. (ADelt 116-18, 118-20) Kalyvia. In the course of cleaning operations for an irrigation ditch at the site of the W cemetery of Elis, a group of four tombs of R date was excavated (3 built tombs, 1 cist) and 4 pithos burials, ranging in date from the end of the 8th Ct BC/early 7th Ct BC to the early 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 112-13) Kolokytha. A large cist tomb was investigated, lined with monolithic slabs, and a burial pithos to its E, surrounded by fragments of gold and other finds, including part of a gilded bone object, pierced by thin bronze nails. To the SE of the cist tomb part of a wall was found. (ADelt 112) Koskinas. The remains of a pithos burial at the site of Lak- koulia, discovered by a hunter, confirm the funerary use of the valley in the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC; the LG-A finds in the area are non-funerary. (ADelt 120-1) Makrisia. Looted cist tombs of the Ch period were investi- gated at the site of Agianne and two more were excavated at Babes Krestenon. (ADelt 118) Morea Project. The 7th season of the Minnesota Morea Project took place in July-August and November 1997, under the direction of Frederick A. Cooper and Joseph D. Alchermes, who report: "The 1997 report divides into three sections, each dealing with the separate phases of this season: Survey of village vernacular architecture: a small crew of five surveyed and mapped three villages and a ruined water mill at Marina Maritsa. The village of Kertezi contains three houses within a Tourkokratia neighborhood, including a tower house of three stories that probably originally had five stories. This is called locally the 'Chasapopoulos Pyrgos'. Three houses were recorded in Kerpeni, including a tower house called the 'Zaimis Pyrgos'. Vithoulkas was also surveyed. Prospection for uncharted medieval settlements: in the company of Cooper and Kourelis, Dimitris Athanasoulias, epimelete of the 6th Byz Ephorate, visited two of the Med sites that we have surveyed: Kastro tis Oreias and Stavraki. Using satellite spectral signatures in combination with topographical names, such as 'kastro', 'paleohori', and 'petrohori', we discovered Salmeniko and Mesovouni. The medieval citadel at Salmeniko includes ten houses and a gate complex. Two other Med settlements were mapped this year: Paleo Skiadas, 38 houses, and Stavraki, 7-10 houses, pinpointed in 1996 by spectral signatures. In the cliffs that rise to the N of Stavraki, we located a cave monastery dating to the Tourkokratia; this was not surveyed. The crew was unsuccessful in its attempt to find Mesovouni during fieldwork in August. Cooper and Kourelis successfully negotiated the long and arduous climb in November. Due to inclement weather, there was not adequate time to complete a survey of the remains. A 2m thick circuit wall, with towers to the N and S, runs the perimeter of the crown of the mountain top, enclosing a rectangular building (4.9m x 5.90m). On the slopes to the E, a series of built terraces step downward and hold square and rectangular base courses to Frankokrateia houses, similar to those at nearby Kastro tis Oreias and Stavraki. From the initial survey, we judge that Mesovouni contains the remains of at least 30 houses. Planning for publication and exhibition: most of the 1997 season was spent organizing and preparing the results of the Morea Survey for publication and exhibition. We see this presentation as two-fold: a travelling exhibition accompanied by a catalogue of essays, statistical tables, and illustrations. During this period, we continued to make final drawings of houses being considered for publication. The format was codified and chapters assigned to authors. These plans were confirmed by Charis Kalliga, Director of the Gennadeion Library (ASCS), who supports our plan to open the exhibition at that institution. After the opening in Athens, the exhibition travels to other cities in the NW Peloponnese. In anticipation of the catalogue and exhibition, Helen Foster presented the Morea Project's aims and findings during the International Congress of Traditional Balkan Architecture in Thessalonike on 8 November."</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 49 wpmiiii . .. .. .. .. .. ~-i?:..........

Klaus Herrmann (DAI) reports on work at Olympia in 1997: "As in previous years, several campaigns were carried out under the direction of H. Kyrieleis. During architectural investigations in the bouleuterion, K. Herrmann made several soundings. An area in the NE corner of the middle building was investigated, in order to learn whether the spolia of small Doric architectural elements built into the foundations of the entrance hall (see AR 1996-97, 45) belong to an older installation situated between the two apsidal buildings. The result was negative, since neither foundations nor robber trenches were found. An area in the S part of the entrance hall produced the most important results. Here the foundations of the S apsidal building were partially cleared. A building pit, cut into during this process, contained LA pottery, thus producing stratigraphic confirmation of the date so far arrived at. In addition, a survey of the krepis showed that the front of the S building was curved. Close to the foundations of the entrance hall further undisturbed parts of the building pit were discovered. The pottery found in it supports the new dating of the hall to the middle of the 5th Ct. The well discovered in front of the SE comer of the bouleuterion (Fig. 67), not totally excavated in 1879 because of the high groundwater level, proved to be productive. It is ........... Fig. 69 lined with 10 terracotta rings, whose three sections are fitted together with clamps. New is the observation of positioning marks, which fixed the sequence of individual elements. The fill produced some nearly perfect vessels dating to the 1st half of the 2nd Ct BC and important parts of the roof of the 'early undulating sima', among them a well-preserved gutter block and adjacent fitting fragments of the sima (Fig. 68). The 'architectural' autumn campaign mainly concerned the embankment wall of the Kladeos. In collaboration with J. Knauss the block of earth at the N end of the wall, already cut into last year, was completely removed. This showed that the original end of the dike, built of large blocks of conglomerate, is entirely preserved. But it was a surprise to discover that the R walling (see AR 1996-97, 45) was by no means the first repair, for below it and in the canal W of it numerous squared poros blocks were found, which already much earlier safe- guarded the entrance. This proves that an older breach of the river wall existed, which must have been related to the gymnasium. It is possible that the remarkably large blocks found are from the foundations of one of the halls belonging to this complex. A section 75m further S made it possible to examine the silt of the regulated river-bed W of the wall (Fig. 69). Reaching to the upper edge of the wall, thick layers of gravel with finer silt deposits above them were observed, which reached a height of about 6m. The pottery found in the canal makes it likely that already in R times the canal was completely silted up and had to find another way through the anc. area. In addition, large tracts of the embankment wall were cleaned, which led to the discovery, in later walling, of a statue base with the inscription IIPOXHNIAAX, who had erected a statue in honour of his father, XPHXTIQNOX. Investigations in the metrooin were also continued by W. Osthues. In a sounding in the NW corner of the peristasis the foundations were cleared to their lower edge. Here, a long length of the foundation trench was still present. The finds, however, were mainly A and EC pottery from the time before the erection of the temple. The earliest possible date for the beginning of this building is indicated by a rf lekythos of ca 430/420 BC, found under the foundations. Apart from these investigations, work on the preservation and tidying-up of the area was continued under the direction of K. Herrmann. During the reorganization in the area of the bouleuterion, displaced building elements were removed and the area filled up with earth and planted. In addition, the first</page><page sequence="50">50 DAVID BLACKMAN ::-?r.?::::: ;:i:::::__ i:i:i:i:::::;? ?:jW': :?::::~i:::i _..~ii~?i?-?:- iiiiii:i.iiiiiiii Fig. 70 w ;4A:.: Mr.,::: 1? 4~ra -`7::a r:: ??:::; :::i ::-: --~: :: i-::::i;::r:-i-M m I.'::::: Alliiii:~ii~i::l /ii-':::"::: Fig. 71 courses of the vault of the great hall in the SW building, which threatened to collapse, were made safe in compliance with the suggestions of Engineer K. Zambas (Fig. 70). The research project 'Olympia in the Roman Imperial Period and in Late Antiquity' continued in 1997 under the direction of U. Sinn. Excavations only took place by the SW building, which is interpreted as the club-house of the athletic guilds. The aim of completely clearing the N main hall was achieved. Its S wall rises about 8m above the floor. Two small windows in the wall deserve notice: one is circular (diam. ca 45cm), the other one is arched at the top (Fig. 71). Only the round window on the E served as a source of light; on the outside it has a vertical frame, semi-circular at the top. For unknown reasons it is set obliquely into the ca 90cm thick wall. The second window does not open to the outside, only to the adjacent room on the S. In the S wall (preserved to its full height) the system of iron clamps for fastening the ornamental outer marble facing is completely preserved by negative impressions. As in the W hall (half of wvhich was cleared earlier), so also in the N hall large parts of the floor covering were torn out when the building was abandoned (Fig. 72). The flooring, however, stayed untouched in the S and E parts of the room, so that one can see traces of its former use in the SE corner: namely a basin with interior measurements of 1.60 x 1.50m -:::i::_: :::: ::i Fig. 72 and a depth of about 0.80m. This addition was built in late antiquity. On two sides, two steps lead into the basin. The bottom and side walls still show the remains of marble cladding. This comparatively expensive finish is different from other late antique basins used in workshops (wine-making, pottery). The function of this one is as yet unknown. Outside and E of the N hall, a grave was discovered, in which a female of the EByz settlement was buried. According to the stratigraphy, the grave belongs to the 6th Ct. As usual in burials of that time, the corpse was covered only with terracotta plaques (tiles). Unusual is the discovery of seven skeletons of tortoises placed to one side and above the head. Since the tortoises were enclosed by irregular stones, they were undoubtedly put there intentionally. The ritual possibly continues the memory of the anc. cult of Aphrodite Urania in Elis. The clearing of the W Room is nearly finished. Here the flooring was undamaged, except in the NW corner, where it had been cut into for a burial. Both graves were investigated by Th. Volling during his study of the EByz settlement in the area of the former Sanctuary of Zeus. The story of the Ch settlement ends in the early 7th Ct, after the population had markedly declined from the middle of the 6th Ct onwards. One reason for the abandonment of the settlement in this fertile valley of the Alpheios was undoubted- ly the threat from the Slavs who were pushing down from the N. In the early 7th Ct they had settled in the valley of the Kladeos. Their extensive necropolis was cleared by N. Yalouris during the excavations for the new museum NW of the Kronos</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 51 hill. The excavator left with us all the material to work on. T. Vida (Budapest) has seen all the finds from the graves. The cremations of the Slavs with grave goods of pottery, utensils and jewellery are dated from the early 7th to the late 8th Ct. That the Slavs did not stay long in the area of the Kronos hill, is probably due to the Kladeos. Its flooding and sand deposits were obviously far more dramatic than hitherto assumed. It had been thought that the Kladeos took several centuries to cover the plain at the foot of the Kronos hill with a layer of sand, which in the end was 4-5m deep. This year's excavations furnished for the first time concrete proof of the actual time span. The 'SW building' was already covered to the top of its walls in the 9th Ct. In the uppermost layers some sherds dating from this period were found, showing that the area of the EByz settlement above the sanctuary of Zeus was being covered by sand during the 7th and 8th Cts." Phigaleia. Two large R cist tombs, with traces of plaster on the walls, were investigated at the site of Dendrouli. (ADelt 118) Xeni Arapogianni reports in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (43-49) on the second season of excavation at the temple of Zeus Soter and Athena, when both the interior of the temple and the surrounding area were investigated (for the first season see AR 1996-97, 46-47, with plan). The removal of the Byz wall on the W side revealed the foundations of the temple, as well as two fragmentary walls, antedating the temple, on either side of the base for the cult statue, perhaps the remains of a small cella earlier than the 4th Ct BC. Two trenches dug in the pronaos produced PR sherds and remains of walls, suggesting that the area of the temple was occupied during this period. Fragmentary inscriptions found within the Byz wall indicate that the temple itself was flourishing in the 2nd Ct BC, and confirmed the importance of the temple for the Phigaleians. Investigations outside the S side of the temple, and especial- ly of the lowest layer, contemporary with the use of the temple, revealed that the bedrock had been levelled and a small part of a cave had been cut, to form a narrow bench, where the worshippers placed their votive offerings. The latter included a large bronze fibula inscribed xtct 'A06vaot, as well as a number of clay busts of the goddess. Bronze sheets, pieces of jewellery, parts of bronze vessels, bronze arrowheads, and the foot of a small bronze lion, were among the offerings dis- covered in the fill outside the SE corner of the temple. In the flat ground to the N of the temple, test trenches revealed remains of walls and a tomb of the PR period (MH, ELH, Myc). Sosti. At the site of Dalamareika, to the E of the road from Amaliada to Roupaki, a number of tumuli have been identified since 1960 (ADelt 16, 135). One of these tumuli was excavated this year, owing to illegal activities in the area; it was 30m in diameter, a maximum of 4.60m in height and consisted of three main layers, including the remains of three pithos burials at the S end (Fig. 73). At the top of the tumulus lay a looted cist tomb. The surrounding area was covered with parallel rows of shallow cuttings (max 1: 20m, depth: 0.06m), at intervals ranging between 0.50m and 1.70m. At three different points were identified three shallow well-like structures, contemporary with the cuttings (Fig. 74). On the periphery of the tumulus, above the level of the cuttings, were recorded traces of burning and ashes, possibly related to the funerary activities at the tumulus. Judging by the obscure features on the surface of the tumulus and the surrounding area (cuttings, wells), the concen- tration of iron objects and the large percentage of rust in the earth, it seems that workshop activities antedated the erection of the tumulus.

(ADelt 118) Zakynthos. Chora. Part of the anc. fortification walls (HL- LR), built in a pseudo-isodomic style, were discovered at the junction of Odos Mantzarou and Therianou, near which C-HL isodomic walls were identified in 1979. At the S end, the fortification wall was damaged by later intrusive features (pottery kiln, drainpipe), while various additions to its E face represent more recent modifications. The foundations of a rectangular building in isodomic masonry were recorded in the E part of the plot.

(ADelt 121) Ellenika Antheias. Owing to illegal activities in the Myc cemetery of Ellenika, where five chamber tombs have already been excavated (ADelt 44, 108), a new chamber tomb (No. 6) was investigated this year: a monumental structure, similar to the other tombs in the cemetery, with a double pitched roof and a second chamber to the N.

A small building, probably a Myc tholos or chamber tomb of the Karpophora Pylias type, was located at the site of Maurolongos and is to be excavated in the coming year. (ADelt 125-6) Messene. P. Themeles reports on the 1997 season in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (34-42); he completed the excavation of the two LR funerary monuments belonging to wealthy families of Messene, outside the Arkadian gate (see AR 1996-97, 48). Among the finds was a metric funerary inscription of LR date, which suggests that the dead man was a poet or a singer. In the other monument were found more pieces of a marble sarcopha- gus of the 2nd Ct AD, with relief decoration. Further remains of other funerary monuments, built of reused architectural members, were unearthed in the vicinity. In the NE area of the theatre cavea, part of a Byz settle- ment was excavated, built with spoil from the earlier monu- ment, and which had flourished between the 11th and 13th Cts AD. The fill under the cavea was apparently artificial, and it was retained by a terrace wall which supported staircases leading to the upper parts of the theatre. In the funerary monument opposite the entrance to the Asklepieion were unearthed seven cist tombs, one with the remains of four skeletons, while in the area of the gymnasium further excava- tion clarified the plan of the N and E stoas which surrounded it, and defined the number of kerkides and rows in the stadium (Fig. 76). In front of the E stoa was found a rectangular podium decorated on its sides with shields in relief, and with half columns at the corners. According to the excavator it originally bore a Doric column on which was set a memorial in honour of those who had fallen in the battle of Makistos in Eleia; the column was found in 1996 (see AR 1996-97, 49). The W part of the W stoa of the gymnasium was occupied by a HL funerary monument (K3), containing eight cist tombs, arranged concentrically around a central rectangular shaft, formed by the sides of the other tombs (Fig. 77). According to the excavator, over these tombs was built a rectangular chamber with a conical roof, crowned by a Cor column, bearing a bronze object, a highly unusual architectural arrange- ment for mainland Greece. On the Ionic lintel of the chamber are preserved the names of those buried in the tomb. Finally, N of this building, the H-shaped building discovered in 1995, dedicated as an altar of Heracles was investigated (AR 1995-96, 18). The monument (Ki) consisted of a chamber with a stone door of the Macedonian type; in the interior of the tomb were excavated seven cist graves, with offerings. The highest part of the E side of the monument was decorated with a frieze in relief (running deer, catlike animals and griffins); at the ends was preserved a complete group depicting a lion devouring a deer. An honorific epigram of the 3rd Ct BC, inscribed on the capital of a pedestal found in the N stoa of the gymnasium, honoured Damostratos, a Spartan, who acted as a mediator between his state and Messene, at a time when relations between the two cities were tense.

Pylos Regional Archaeological Project. Jack L. Davis reports on PRAP's 7th season in May-August 1997: "The goals of the season were three: (1) To re-study selected published and unpublished finds from Blegen's excavations. (2) To improve the storage condi- tions of artifacts from Blegen's excavations at the Palace of Nestor. (3) To conduct supplementary geophysical fieldwork in the town around the citadel on which the Palace of Nestor is located. (Reorganization of the Blegen finds and their study was conducted exclusively on tables behind the second apotheke of Chora museum, under direct supervision of museum guards and was organized by Sharon Stocker on behalf of PRAP.)

The work described below has been conducted under the supervision of John Bennet, Jack Davis, and Cynthia Shelmerdine. Pre-palatial finds were the most neglected; only a few pre- Myc sherds are described in PON III, despite the fact that Blegen's team excavated MH (and probably also late EBA) strata in many parts of the citadel and its vicinity, while searching for a Myc fortification wall. In several instances the strata are deep and the quantities of finds are very substantial, e.g. in trench S5 on the citadel and in the Petropoulos trench in the lower town. The systematic study of the finds should for the first time establish solid foundations for an informed examination of the earliest stages in the development of a complex palace-based society at Englianos. The first stage in this investigation was completed by Sharon R. Stocker and submitted in 1995 to the University of Cincinnati as her M.A. thesis, 'Deriziotis Aloni: A small BA Site in Messenia', the full publication of a significant site of the EMH period on the Englianos ridge, approximately 1 km SW of the PON, now being revised for submission for publica- tion in Hesperia. In June 1996, approximately 300 MH sherds from the citadel of the PON itself were catalogued and drawn. Stocker has collaborated fully with Yiannos Lolos in the publication of MH finds from the PRAP survey. She will also collaborate with Mike Nelson and Fred Cooper of the MAWRP project in unravelling the complicated history of pre-palatial complexes of walls excavated by Blegen and recently re- exposed. In 1997, her research focused on re-examination of MH and transitional MH/LH finds from the Kanakares tomb, excavated by Lord William Taylour in 1953. About one-half of the finds were catalogued, described, measured, and photographed; many were also drawn. Sherds included in plates in Vol. III of the PON were also studied, as were selected finds excavated by Papathanasopoulos in '59, '60, and '61. All studies were clearly preliminary and no conclusions can be drawn as yet other than it is already clear that a substantial amount of MH material from various excavated trenches remains unpublished and that these trenches are widely distributed at the site.

Hofstra's research program involves a functional analysis of different areas of the Palace of Nestor. In her view a restudy of the small finds from the site, in conjunction with the Linear B tablets, will contribute greatly to an understanding of what activities were carried out at the site in its final phase, ca 1200 BC, and how different parts of the palace were used. Some specialised areas have already been identified and studied by others, such as the wine and perfumed oil storerooms; Hofstra will be the first to examine the palace as a whole, including those areas which may be multipurpose or whose function is now unclear. Recent anthropological theories have also raised questions about the importance of gender in economic and social activities. The archive and artifacts of the palace are well-suited to this type of enquiry. The tablets provide informa- tion about an extensive labour force of both men and women, of diverse social and occupational status. Through study of tomb as well as settlement finds it may also be possible to associate specific artifacts with each gender, and thus draw further information about those who worked in a given locale. In 1997 she catalogued previously uncatalogued small finds in the basement of the Museum of Chora and prepared photo- graphs and drawings of them, beginning with objects related to textile manufacture: spindle-whorls, loom-weights, awls, and needles, some of which were found during the re-packing process, mixed with pottery-then continuing her examination by photographing stone objects. From an examination of Blegen's excavation reports, Robert Schon argued in his Master's thesis presented in 1995 to Bryn Mawr College that the manufacture of chariots was organized and carried out in the NE building of the Palace of Nestor at Pylos. This hypothesis was based primarily on textual evidence provided by Linear B tablets found in the building, as well as from the archives room. Artifacts excavated in and around the building, such as tools and pieces of bronze and ivory, pro- vided some further supporting evidence, but often the descrip- tions of objects were incomplete. In 1997, Schon examined cursorily in the basement of the Chora Museum all material excavated from the NE building. (2) Hofstra, Schon, and Stocker worked to improve the access to the Blegen finds that future scholars will have. Artifacts are often difficult or impossible to examine because they are kept in large barrels, with much pottery from individ- ual excavation strata now separated only by rotting sheets of newspaper. There began in 1997 the laborious task of system- atically re-bagging and re-labelling this material so that its contexts will be preserved for the future. Approximately one- third of the finds were so treated. In very many cases, labels were found to be badly damaged and had they not been replaced, contexts would have been totally lost within several more years. The task will require at least two more years to complete. (3) Geophysical Survey: in 1959, Blegen's team dug three trenches (LT I-III) approximately 20m SW of the excavated buildings of the Palace of Nestor. In those trenches several distinct strata with relatively well-preserved remains of LBA buildings with some substantial rooms from the era of the late palace were found. To determine systematically the extent and continuity of structures in this area, we employed an array of different geophysical methods during a systematic reconnais- sance in 1995 (report submitted to Hesperia). We established a grid of 10 x 10m squares covering a total of 10,150m2, with a maximum NW/SE extension of 180m and a maximum NE/SW extension of 90m. Within this grid two magnetometers, one electromagnetic instrument and a resistivity survey with two different electrode arrangements were conducted. The most remarkable results of the geophysical prospecting was the discovery of a 60m long lineament on the steep N-W side of the Epano Englianos ridge. Using computer modelling we were able to determine that the upper boundary of the source causing the anomaly seems to be Im below the surface and is certainly not deeper than 1.5m. The width of the source appeared to be approximately 2-2.7m. The most plausible explanation for this anomaly is that it marks the remains of a massive fortification around the citadel, possibly indicating the outer margin of the settlement surrounding it. The 1995 data provided an excellent start from which the anomaly could be traced further. Moreover, since the anomaly showed up clearly in all magnetometer and resistivity measure- ments, the follow-up investigation could be conducted using the Overhauser instrument only, because this magnetometer is easy to operate and allows fast progress in the field. For this research a team of five to six experts was employed for approximately two weeks in July-August 1997. The investiga- tion was limited to an area up to 300m W and S of the fence surrounding the palace. Field activities were limited to setting up a 10m grid and collecting measurements with the hand-held Overhauser magnetometer. The fieldwork was overseen by Eberhard Zangger, co-director of PRAP and head of natural scientific operations. Investigations shed substantial light on the nature of the construction. We were able to trace the anomaly further around the palace, sufficiently far to offer strong support to the</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 55 vt vain rllr . lrr. Fig. 78 hypothesis that it did once encircle the citadel on which the palace stood. The anomaly does not appear to have been a support wall for a building terrace, because it crosses contours and recent terraces. The likelihood that we have found the remains of a fortification wall is strengthed also by a report from Ms Litsa Malapani, representative of the Olympia Ephorate, that in August 1996 excavations by OTE to lay a telephone cable uncovered a 3m-thick wall NW of the Palace of Nestor. In the areas investigated by us, the anomaly event- ually could not be traced further in any direction, either because its remains have been eroded or because they are buried too deeply to be detected by our instruments. A large approximately square structure was noted outside the perimeter defined by the anomaly. Illustrations are being prepared and a fuller report will be submitted to the Ephorate early in 1998. Ottoman Studies: Bennet and Davis spent two weeks in Chora in June-July examining unpublished Ott documents from 1715 that describe settlements in W Messenia in great detail; these documents were acquired from archives in Istanbul and should greatly improve our understanding of patterns of settlement in Messenia as they existed under Ott occupation. A full study will be published by us in co-operation with Pro- fessor Fariba Zarinebaf. Publications: a general book summarizing the results of PRAP in the context of overall Messenian history and prehis- tory (entitled Sandy Pylos: an Archaeological History from Nestor to Navarino) will be published simultaneously both in paperback and hardback in February/March 1998 by the University of Texas Press. A 250-page technical description of the results of PRAP was published in Hesperia 1997, 391-494, 549-641. A fully illustrated catalogue of PRAP sites and artifacts continues to be available on the WorldWideWeb at http://clas- sics. Isa.umich.edu/PRAP.html, and is regularly updated." F.A. Cooper reports on the sixth season of the Minnesota Pylos Project, from June to July 1997, extended to September for aerial photography: "As in 1991 through 1996, our purpose was to clear the area of backfill in order to create a state plan of the walls; earth was removed down to the lowest course of stone or to the level reached by the original excavators (see AR 1996-97, 50). The 1997 season saw the completion of the SW area, and thus the entirety of the site. The maze of miscellaneous rubble walls and ashlar construction required careful cleaning. In addition, the early threshold between rooms 41 and 42 and the plaster floors across area 58 were investigated. Of particular interest was the 'loggia' and the system of drains which can be traced by openings, fissures in plaster, and like features in areas 58 and 59. In other words, the re-excavation of Blegen trenches concentrated in a quadrant defined by 080:795 at NE, 065:800 at SE, 065:775 at SW and 095:780 at NW. The SW area comprises rooms 60, 62, building X, the great drain, and miscellaneous walls left nameless by Blegen. The latter constructions proved to be no less complex than the structures investigated in earlier seasons; Blegen's plans for the most part do not record the assortment of walls representing diverse phases of construction. A monumental entranceway, a major feature of the BA site, emerged from a decipherment and interpretation of the hodge- podge of cobble and field stones which fill the S quadrant, beyond the limits of the SW Building (Fig. 78). This SW gateway has three phases of construction. It lies on axis with the NE gateway, but on the opposite side of the Ano Englianos ridge. In the first phase, the approach consisted of a flagged set of steps laid in convex arcs with low risers (only 0.10m in height). The treads are broad (0.50m wide). In the second phase, a stucco ramp was built on top of the flagged steps and rises at a steeper but even gradient. The second-period gateway has a striking and distinguishing feature: a staircase of dressed- stone construction that has two wings L-shaped in plan which intersects at right angles the top step of the first flight. The left or NW wing returns to the outside to form a two-sided courtyard for the outer flight of steps. The right-hand wing returns to the inside; both serve as retaining walls and vertical faces to the monumental faqade. A second flight of six steps continues beyond the cross wall and has steps convex in plan, like its predecessor. The perspective view (Fig. 79) illustrates the overall design and the relationship of the gateway and staircase as they lead towards the main building. At the close of the 1998 field season, three to seven workmen commenced cleaning the entire site as re-excavated by the MARWP Pylos Project in 1992-1996: the shaft grave, the sondage in the vestibule of the wine magazine, and stretches of the aqueduct were not uncovered. Aerial photography was under the supervision of Chara- lambos lonnannides (National Technical Institute, Department</page><page sequence="56">56 DAVID BLACKMAN '~c~-4~? \v ~L/ ~7 ~I ~7 ~'~FZ .p' ~Y 9~a~L'?~~ '" ?i t, Fig. 79 of Photogrammetry). Coverage by helicopter was deemed superior to low-altitude balloon photography. The close proximity of the surrounding fence and high-tension electric wires, the density of trees, and the prevailing high winds weighed in favour of an overflight by helicopter. Backfilling of the entire site took place at the end of the season. Conservation. The conservation laboratory, established in 1994, was set up again this season in the Demotic School. Jenny Gliata continued as assistant conservator. Dr David Jordan examined the curled lead tablet found in 1996. There was no writing on the interior. Instead, this object may have been a lead weight wrapped around a rope, rather than a 'curse tablet' as previously hypothesized. Further refinements were made to the processing of fresco fragments. This included the addition of an inventory sheet for a drawing and a check list for a standardised taxonomy and a chart for a record of the 'stroses' or thickness of layers of underlying plaster. Drawings and colors are being digitised into AutoCAD and Arc/Info files for the purposes of sorting, matching joins, and restoration of scenes." Strefi. A low tumulus-type construction was located at the site of Armakadia, 250m N of the tumulus of Galarobouni, while illegal activities at the Strefi tumulus revealed part of a substan- tial monument, probably a Myc tholos tomb. (ADelt 125) KERKYRA AND THESPROTIA Anemomylos. In the second season of excavations a further section was investigated of the W exterior wall of a PCh-R building and small parts of three interior spaces of this building, as well as retaining walls antedating it, parts of stone pipes and two circular wells. To the S of the building was excavated part of a plastered bathroom, preserving a small section of a mosaic floor of white pebbles on a red plastered background and a small plastered double bathtub with a seat, as well as ancillary spaces next to it. (ADelt 342-6) Garitsa. A further part of the extensive cemetery of the anc. city, including a total of 22 burials of various types (17 simple burials, 2 tile-roofed tombs, 3 pot burials), was excavated at the junction of Odos Kyprou and the 3rd Parodos Alkinoou (ADelt 42, 341). The burials ranged in date between the C and the EHL periods. Below these burials was excavated the southward continuation of the N-shaped peribolos wall, of LA date, discovered in 1991, as well as the N part of a second A funerary peribolos of the same construction (pseudo-isodomic masonry on the exterior, artificial fill on the interior of the wall). Scattered A burials were located E of the two periboloi. Another part of the same cemetery was investigated at the junction of Odos Kyprou and Dalietou, including a number of burials, among pyres and broken pots, scattered over the whole area (pithos burials, pit graves, tile-roofed tombs). A horse- shoe-shaped funerary peribolos was excavated in the centre of the plot, including a sarcophagus and traces of a pyre of long rectangular shape, with a floor of baked clay slabs. To the W of the peribolos was located a rectangular ritual eschara, of A date, built of three rows of rectangular clay slabs, placed vertically in the ground. (ADelt 340-2) Kerkyra town. Two well-built R buildings were excavated at the Tzilaria-Kakaraki site and in the Leukimme area. (ADelt 357-8) Phigareto. During the 10th season of excavations in the area of the two LA workshop pits, many fragments were recorded of clay figurines, a mould for female figurines of the severe style, animal figurines and amphoras of the 5th Ct BC. To the NE of kiln 6, pottery sherds ranged in date between the A and the HL period, while other finds included figurines, one silver coin and 20 bronze coins (Kerkyraean 400-300 BC and 229-40 BC). To the SW of the courtyard of the monastery of Panagia Kassopitra, where Lechat (BCH 15 (1891) I-III) had located the site of 'a small shrine of Artemis', and where the 1991 excavations revealed H-shaped R constructions, a unique A headless kouros was unearthed this year, the only example of its kind ever discovered in Kerkyra (pres. ht: 85cm), dated to</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 57 Fig. 80 ca 535 BC (Anavyssos-Ptoon 12 group), of Parian marble (Fig. 80-81). Part of an elaborate A water supply system was investigated 3m N of the kouros, including a H-shaped stone drainpipe (L: 19m, W: 0.72m, Ht: 0.45m ), sloping down towards the Hyllaic port, two rectangular water-basins, second- ary pipes, a stone-built well and finally, on one of the poros covers of the pipes, a boustrophedon inscription (NAI=FIAN), dated to the end of the 6th Ct /start of the 5th Ct BC. The architectural remains consisted of the corner of a LHL build- ing, roofed with Cor tiles. On the whole, it seems that there was a gap in the use of the area between the A and LHL periods. (ADelt 334-8) In the second season of excavations on the Kanoni penin- sula (ADelt 42, 336), remains of a shipshed were revealed in the easternmost section of the anc. Hyllaic harbour. They are Fig. 81 related to the shipsheds found in the other big harbour of anc. Kerkyra, the harbour of Alkinoos, in the Anemomylos area (PAE 1966, 85-87), and are dated to the A/EC-LHL/ER periods. This year two E-W rows were excavated of 10 and 13 piers, 25m and 33m long respectively, indicating the length of the Kerkyraean triremes which were repaired, constructed or just kept there over the winter (Fig. 82). The clear width between the two rows of pillars (4.8m-5.10m), was wide enough for one ship and for workers, while the floor of the slipway sloped down towards the sea. Most piers had circular hollows on their top surface, for the insertion of monolithic unfluted columns, to support the roof (Cor tiles). The S row of piers was founded directly on the LA layer. Storehouses and other storage rooms were located at the E end of the plot.

A total of 43 tombs of a mostly rectangular/trapez- oidal plan, without grave offerings, was excavated in the centre of the mod. settlement. An Epirote coin of 238-168 BC provides some kind of chronological reference. In the S half of the plot were discovered traces of funerary pyres, which suggests that this area, surrounded by a line of stones, was used for communal cremations. The small finds, including ca 30 iron spearheads and three iron knives, illustrate the continu- ous use of the site from N to Imperial R times. (ADelt 355-7) Nea Seleukeia.

During the second phase of the irrigation project in the Kambos Paramythias area, many hitherto unknown sites and tomb concentrations were revealed. One of the most significant finds is the remains of a square hero6n (15m2) of the 3rd Ct BC at Kambos Zervochoriou (Marmara site), which contained a cist tomb, dated to the 3rd Ct BC (pottery, gold jewellery, lock and nails for a wooden coffin), and the stone base of an offering table. The monument was not roofed and was originally crowned by funerary statues, stelae, etc., similar to analogous LC-HL specimens in Attica and NW Greece (Fig. 84). Individual burials of HL and R date were investigated at a number of other sites. (ADelt 348-54) BOIOTIA Anthedon. W of Kastri hill parts of two HL stone buildings were excavated; also a road, with a trodden earth surface, running along one of the buildings. (ADelt 174-5) Boiotia Survey. Dr J.L. Bintliff and Prof. A. M. Snodgrass report on the 1997 field season: "The season ran for six weeks and was the final period of survey fieldwork for the Cambridge-Durham Project. The chief tasks carried out by a team of 15-20 individuals were as follows: Ceramic study of the fieldsurvey finds. Dr Oliver Dickinson, Prof. J. Hayes, Miss J. Vroom and A. Vionis carried out analysis of the PR, Gr-R and Med-post Med finds from the collection of survey finds held in the Thespiae apotheke. There remain a number of sites, especially the major Frankish-era rescue site of Klimmataria, still to be given intensive ceramic analysis by Miss Vroom-a task that will be carried forward to summer 1998. Survey of standing buildings at deserted medieval villages. Four medieval surface sites, studied in previous seasons by the Project, exhibit standing ruined domestic structures: Harmena, VM4, Rhadon and CN4 (beside Hyettos). As part of a sub- project concerned with the development of vernacular architec- ture in Boeotia a sample of houses from each site were planned and photographed. This was done using a total-station under the direction of Dr Bintliff, Prof. F. Aalen and Miss J. Bell. Their age spans the period of 16th-late 19th Cts AD and the data collected will be invaluable in outlining the origin of traditional house types in the region, as well as complementing the information available for these abandoned villages from ceramic analysis and the Ottoman archives. The city of Haliartos. In preparation for the full and final publication of the surface survey of Boeotian cities which the Project carried out during the 1980s (preliminary analyses have appeared in several articles hitherto), it was felt necessary to prepare a more accurate map of the ancient walls of the city of Haliartos than the sketch-maps available in existing publica- tions of the site. This was done using a total-station under the direction of Dr Bintliff and Miss J. Bell. The city of Hyettos. Likewise in connection with the publication of the surface survey of the city of Hyettos, we completed a detailed topographical map of surface features in the lower town at Hyettos, using a total-station, under the direction of Dr Bintliff and Miss Bell. Geographical Survey. D.R. Shiel led a team of soil scien- tists in a final season of sample area study of soil series in the Fig. 85 areas surveyed by the Project, and also conducted interviews on traditional farming in the Valley of the Muses to compare with the account of Hesiod for that locality. Dr Shiel and Dr Bintliff will undertake a final season of geographical work in summer 1998 with a study tour of the different sub-regions of Boeotia in order to set the areas intensively surveyed by the Project into a broader framework of the regional landscapes and types of land-use."

Parts of two ECh mosaic floors of the 5th Ct were uncovered on Christodoulou St; motifs were purely geometric. (ADelt 83-84) Orchomenos. In 1997 the German Archaeological Institute under the direction of K. Fittschen resumed archaeological investigations at Orchomenos, which were started by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in Munich under A. Furtwaeng- ler and H. Bulle at the beginning of this century, but never finished. Dr Fittschen reports: "The aim was to investigate and document the monuments of historic times in this town for final publication. This year a new total plan of the town was made, since the last one (produced by S. Lauffer in RE Suppl. XIV [1974] 294, Fig. 1) was found to contain mistakes. Although the city wall, the most important monument of historic times in Orchomenos, has suffered further destruction since the beginning of the 20th Ct and has left only traces in the area of the mod. settlement, it was possible, by close observation of the beddings in the rock for both faces of the wall, to identify further stretches of wall as well as a tower and a postern gate. The only gate for which there is any evidence is in the N wall, half way up the city hill, and very badly preserved. The road, which in antiquity led from here to Abai, Hyampolis and Opus, is still recognizable beside the footpath used today; it was only negotiable on foot or with animals, not by wagons. The new survey of the Kastro (Fig. 85), when compared with the schematic drawing by A.W. Lawrence (Greek Aims in Fortifications, 1979, Fig. 21), shows that it was fortified on all sides, with a prow-like projection to the W. Thorough cleaning of the rock staircase leading up to the Kastro showed that it could be closed by a door and was protected against arrows by a wall on the N side. The quarries, from which the building material for the Kastro came, were found ca 300m farther W."</page><page sequence="60">60 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 86 Plataiai. Dr Andreas Konecny reports on the autumn 1997 season carried out under the auspices of the Austrian Archae- ological Institute: "Activities at the site were once again concentrated on the fortifications. Whereas during last year's campaign we man- aged to establish a new plan of the site, this year's work was dedicated to a more thorough study of the remains still extant. Work included also a pottery survey of different parts of the town. The preliminary results can be summarised as follows: The so called 'acropolis' in the NW part of the site was the area of the earlier settlement at Plataiai (cf. also E. Kirsten, RE XX [1950] 2255 ff., s.v. Plataiai; J.M. Fossey, Topography of ancient Boeotia [1986] 102 ff.). Only there does the ceramic material include anything earlier than second half of the 4th Ct BC: material from EH on. The plateau of approx. 120,000 m2 must therefore have constituted the nucleus of the settlement at Plataiai and must have been the town invested by the Lacedai- monian-Boeotian force in 429-427 BC. Scant traces of a curtain wall in a style resembling Lesbian masonry can still be traced along the upper W fringe of the plateau (Fig. 86). Every other patch of land already scrutinized offered only material of a later date than 350 BC. The huge enceinte, surrounding ca 0.85 km 2, consisted of a mud-brick wall above a foundation of roughly-hewn blocks and a single layer of trapezoidal ashlar. Taking into account the ceramic material it seems on a preliminary basis possible to date this phase of the fortifications to the re-foundation of the city in the reign of Philip II of Macedon. The walls underwent some reconstruction, which is documented by the substitution of a rectangular by a semicircular tower in the course of the E wall. No remains which could possibly be assigned to the first reconstruction of Plataiai during the Corinthian War have yet been located. This settlement will most probably have included only the area of the acropolis plateau. At some later date the S extension of the city walls was obviously considered unsafe in the face of newly developed means of assault (cf. E. Kirsten, RE XX, 2272 ff.) and the line of fortification was taken back to the N by about 300 yards. The newly erected diateichisma included for the first time at the site such sophistications as evenly spaced towers flanking the curtain, and several sally-ports. It consists of properly shaped ashlar-blocks of considerable size (Fig. 87 shows the tower of the HL diateichisma of Plataiai). Its relative chrono- logical relation to the earlier, LC enceinte can be established at both points where the two walls joined. Judging by the state of development of its tactical layout, a date in EHL times seems probable. The fortifications seem to have been sufficient for the town until in R times they were no longer necessary. At some date during LR or EByz times there arose the need for the refortification of Plataiai. The inhabitants erected a new wall, flanked by numerous towers, which, reducing the enclosed area once again to the extent of the early settlement, followed the edge of the acropolis. In doing so they reused many blocks from the older city walls and also from many other buildings. Settlement activities at the site continued, documented by ceramic material, and also by several small churches, until well past the Med period, within the new walls as well as outside. Whereas the state of preservation of the remains at Plataiai has obviously deteriorated since the time of earlier activities there, satisfactory results were still possible. Therefore the survey is to be continued." Fig. 87</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 61 Ritsona. In the area of Ritsona was located an important C cemetery, including two groups of rectangular built tombs within two funerary periboloi and one funerary pyre; a third group consisted of roofed cist tombs. (ADelt 172-4) Thebes. In 1992, ten ECh and Byz sites were excavated within the town and are reported in ADelt 72-83. The results are briefly summarised below. The area around the church of Agios Nikolaos (which has a 12th-Ct first phase). On O.T. 202 along Vryzaki St a rare opportunity was provided to investigate a series of adjacent plots. Parts of a Byz house were excavated. 11-13th Ct finds included a storage pithos, roof tiles, pottery, metal arrow heads, bronze objects and 15 bronze coins (Nikephoros III, Alexios I, Manuel I, Latin imitations, and two coins of the de la Roche). The pottery, most of it fine ware but much broken, included an almost intact cup with sgraffito decoration of a bird on the inner base (Liakou plot). More domestic remains were found on the Koropouli plot, where five phases were identified. Finds included a small key, a small bell possibly from a cymbal, parts of a pair of scales and a bronze weight in the shape of a cup-like vessel. Forty-nine bronze coins, mostly 11th to 13th Ct, were collected. The adjacent Kasteli plot contains remains associated with the Koropouli plot. A large circular structure (ext. diam. 3.15 m) bounded by four walls may indicate workshop use here. Finds included a treasure of 151 bronze issues of Manuel I, 50 more bronze coins (unidentified) and mid 12th-Ct pottery. A destruction level may date to the Norman sack of 1147. A wealthy owner is suggested by the finds, including fine ware pottery, glass and metal ware and evidence for painted interior walls. Two phases after the destruction level are recorded, prior to abandonment in the mid-13th Ct. Other finds include a well-preserved lock with its key, a clay stamp, a bronze pin and a steatite cross. Other excavations in the town provided more evidence of 11th to 13th-Ct inhabitation, with a desertion in the mid 13th. The Doukas plot on Eteokleous St revealed part of the finely built water conduit (overall width 0.90m and length 0.55m) attributed by written sources to the initiative of the 12th-Ct Metropolitan John Kaloktenes. Building remains at O.T. 179 date from ECh (part of a bath house-the second found in Thebes-with fine masonry, traces of marble revetments on the walls, marble floor and finely decorated lamps and four coins of the 5th and 6th Ct), Med (part of a fortification tower of the walls during the Frankish period; see ADelt 43, 1988, 97 for other remains of this wall), and Ott phases. The excavations on Oidipodos St (with finds going as far back as EH) encountered an extremely interesting monumental secular building dated to the 10th Ct by pottery and a coin found inserted in the cement used for the masonry (Leo IV, 886-912). The N wall uncovered runs for 26m, is 1.10m wide and 2.50m high. The S wall may be under Oidipodos St. A small bronze cauldron with its lid, parts of a clay sauce-boat and part of a plain two-handled vase were also found. The excavators hypothesize that this building may have been associated with the military's presence in Thebes when it was capital of the Helladic theme in MByz times. Two walls of another 9th-10th Ct structure, possibly a domicile, were investigated on O.T. 157 (Zengini St). A coin of Leo VI was also found here, along with contemporary pottery. Fragments of two unfluted columns were found in the foundations. EUBOEA Chalkis. To the N and to the E of a public building of HL date, discovered in 1988-9 (ADelt 44, 159), remains of buildings were excavated, including one earlier C (part of mosaic floor) and two later, HL-LR architectural phases. The four rooms investigated (HL-R) included remains of frescoes with floral and linear motifs and a circular well in the NW corner of room 1, from the bottom of which started two tunnels with arched/vaulted roofs, part of R copper mines in the area. Rectangular and circular constructions in rooms 2 and 4 were associated with a network of clay and stone pipes. (ADelt 175-6) Eretria. S. Schmid reports on the excavations of the Swiss School in 1997: "In the theatre of Eretria the Swiss School started an excavation in collaboration with the 11th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities. The aim of this excavation is to obtain informa- tion about the chronology and architecture of the theatre. These activities are part of a wider program to help in preparing the conservation of the theatre by the Archaeological Service. The Swiss team was directed by Prof. H.-P. Isler of Zurich University. In the koilon a trench of 12m length was opened in the upper part of the fourth kerkis in order to clarify the structure of the koilon. The results showed that indeed the upper part of the koilon is an artificial construction. Surprisingly, five partially preserved rows of seats were found in the upper part of the trench, indicating that the monument's state of preserva- tion in this area may be better then previously supposed. A further trench was opened in the orchestra at the W end of the euripos in order to search for the drain evacuating the water from the orchestra. On this occasion part of the orchestra floor consisting of tamped lime was found as well, confirming the results obtained by the American excavators at the E end of the euripos at the end of the 19th Ct. The excavation in the theatre will continue in 1998 and be extended to a few trenches in the stage building as well. In the area between the upper gymnasium and the 'house with the mosaics' the excavation at point E/600 NW that started in 1996 under the direction of S.G. Schmid was continued in 1997 (Fig. 88). The 1997 season was focused on the building remains S of the main street that crosses the plot (cf. AR 1996-97, 55f). A few walls as well as pottery from the G period indicate building activities at this point already in the earlier history of the city, probably forming the very peripheral part of a settlement concentrated around the area of the later temple of Apollo. The A period is represented so far by a very thin layer-although rich in finds. Fragments of several quite well preserved LA bf lekythoi were found together with several terracotta statuettes (Figs. 89-90). The vases can be dated around 500 BC. For the moment, no buildings connected with these finds were found. Maybe the layer that contained so many well-preserved, although fragmented finds can be connected to the violent destruction of Eretria by the Persians in 490 BC. Almost exclusively all the walls forming the different rectangular rooms and buildings on Fig. 88 were built during the C period, i.e. the 5th and 4th Ct BC, only very few of them (Fig. 88, M8 and M9 in C/1) being later additions. At B-C/3 on Fig. 88 a smaller N-S street meets the main E-W street (Fig. 91, centre). Therefore, the rooms discovered belong to two different buildings on both sides of the N-S street. As most of these rooms were reused in later periods, their exact original function is difficult to define. Given the close neighborhood of</page><page sequence="62">62 DAVID BLACKMAN x= 16325 x= 16325 Echelle 1/200e y=-l5280 y=-15250 0 ...... . .... ...... .... ...... ........ so x= 16310 ERETRIA, E/600 NW 1997 0 10 20 m Fig. 88 Fig. 89 the private dwelling called the 'house with the mosaics' because of its richly decorated mosaic floors, which was excavated by the Swiss School in the 1980s, we may assume that our building on the next street was a private house as well, representing the high standard of living of the Eretrian 'bourgeoisie' in LC times. During the HL period a well, of rectangular shape and built from huge stones, was installed adjacent to the biggest room discovered so far (Fig. 88: St 24 in G/1). The level of the HL streets was covered by the remains of a devastating fire, easily recognizable by its ash-gray colour. This layer is apparently the result of a decisive cleaning of the rooms facing the streets. The very fine ash was full of pottery fragments, including an important number of HL mould-made bowls from different production centres in Greece and the Near East. The detailed analysis of these bowls as well as the fact that in the same layer fragments of eastern terra sigillata vessels were found, suggest a date in the early 1st Ct BC for this destruction. Of course one is tempted to ascribe this evidence to the historically attested armed conflicts during the 1st Mithridatic War in the year 87/6 BC. It is known that the Euboean cities decided to follow Mithridates VI against Rome. At least for Athens, also on Mithridates' side, a cruel slaughter and destruction by the R general Sulla is recorded and it is possible that Eretria suffered the same fate. Remains of the same destruction evidence were found at the bottom of the well mentioned above, inter alia the mould-made bowl (Fig. 92) depicting an erotic scene. However, this destruction by no means marked the end of the settlement under exploration. As reported above, with two exceptions all walls of the earlier building continued to be used well into the R imperial period. In most of the rooms new floor levels were constructed covering the earlier levels. For these new floors the technique of bricks on edge was used, a characteristic feature not known before the reign of Augustus (27 BC-14 AD). Most interesting is the function of the thus created new installations. In the biggest complex (Fig. 93, FG/1-2 on Fig. 88) not only was a new floor constructed, but</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 63 r :-:?: - ? ::iiiii:ii-~ ::::: i-i;i:i ~i?B? ~ 6e~i~4~ ss~ s~f~a~ ~s~ hs~s~i~B~nses~a~8sla~-lijl:-::::i-i:,- :::::?::-:::::-:-:-::-:_:-:_:I--:: ::: -::~: ~--;_-i-;::-::-:-:::::::--::-_:~-::-:::. ::?-:; : s:. ...- :iii:: i .-.-.-:- i-i~iiiii-i j :-;-:::----:::-:-: -i .:. 1::-.::_::- j ---::: :::::::-:::;?-:-::-: :::: : :::- :::::_:_;~ B-~C'eiiiiii$i?i'i:i?:~;-.l---:-"::il-- ::;;-: ::---::-::-j: :ii?-i:i-ii:i;i?ir::i(.iiii:.-'---?ii-i-i '?i ii:ij;ili;:;'. i-:ii . i.---/i-iii: -:::;?il-i:li?'-' - -':--~:-:: -:-:::- ----::---?- :;:~i:-ii i-?::::::.-'--:l?iili:,:,,::,:i: i:.:: ::-:: .::::::-: ,.:. _: :;-: ,li:.::;- _::_:_ :::::::.-.:j`-i:i-i:i:i-:'9-:iili--;~,: . :: ::-:'::::' -::---- i-,::ii-'i:::::_- ::j: i-i:--::-~l:i::::: I ::-:?-:_:;-r i:;::;:-::::: ::::-::--:::. -;:::: :-:-: -::: ::.:::: ;--- :--. -:??:::? -:?: :-: i::: :: i:::::::::- -~--i '--i:i- :::i~l: -: -- -i:: ;. i:i::::i : ~i-ir-i i i ii;ii-:?i - . :: : ::---: ;_:::i:?:-:::i:::i-:-:::'i::-i:?:::::-i: :-::`-:;::-:_ :,::::'i::?:?::-: - -?-:??_ ::: : : - ::? :~:::'::::-- Fig. 90 ::l-ii-;1'4::-;.:":il::::'::::::::8i:i ~~:'~::- I.:.:i:i~~~~ ,_1:::::, :-:-:.:., ~,_g:~?~i~aal:s -:lil'-~l%'i:i`:'~i- :: 8::::?:i:l.:-::::::i:-:-_;::~iP:?::::?' :j:::l::?::::i:::::::::j-::: :I`:;::.:::::-,~:c 15iI: '~'i-sf Fl;~"~?-il: ? :, ~i::-i~?:lil-il:ar?i::::?:?::? :::::-:::::::::::? i:: ::- ';l:l'i::li:ii:i:li':::::I:':::: ::::':::::: :::::::::::-:.:::-~ :. ?--,;:--:i:?:ii:i~::~:; .-i-:iii--:-a ii iii-i- :i:::_:::i:::i:l:::- _::-i:_:i:j::;?::::.: ,::::~ :':'i::~i'?:l:::::_::_-i:l:i_::i--l-iYi ::,---:?-a:a?.:j::::::.::;::9:il:::::.- '-'i:ii:i-ii:iiiiii-ii,~ici;i:i:-i~i-i:i j-i:-:- :::::::::::::: ::::::i:::::i::::: :i~:::-::- :::::: ::::::::::::::::j. : : ::--:-:-:::.:::-:: )8i%:,iliiii,,,,,,,--.?.?-:I::::?.i::::: :::?::::-:::'-:- :-:: - :-:?::::.-:':'' :'-:iii'iiiii iiiiiilii' _lii::'iliiiii::l :::::::: :?:::: :?::::?;:-:?:::::::::::j:::::: i'i'iiirii :iiiiiiiiii-iiii'ii iiiiiiiii:i`"'- ~:-:: i:-?:;iii i i-iii:i-iii:i: :::i:- i::i::-:i i'i'i::'-'iiijiiil: ::ii:iii_:i -::::j:::-::::-r-::-::: ::i:::i-i:-::::i:;: -:i:j:~~::::: - :i::::i-:-i:X:~:~ l-:.:"j:$;t_:_Bt??I?-::.. ~4i-?:a?i?i_:i i-ii-i-i~-iii iiia-i~li:r.~:: iii I:::::jj2i:::~ I::::i:i: i~~~~" :?::i::::-:: ::::::j:,:: :i~ag$j~: a.. i:? ici :.:: :: '''':''''~'''':':':' ':' i:::iili:ii:ii:i:?i?i:ii:i iii:?i:~l?i ii:i:i?il::: i:::-i-l:::;l;:::: : i:i :::':':':':'::::::':': I:~i-:-:-:::'::.'~:i?~i~~::*I ':::;-iiiii i'-:;:--_:::-::;:: niP~:SfiS'-6-~??;-:i-::l~-; Fig. 91 a second wall consisting of tiles was built directly adjoining the older stone walls, still in good condition.

As a water channel leads directly to the basin from the rectangular well to its S, it is obvious that it served as a container of liquid, the question being what was its use. A second basin of similar construction was installed a few metres W of the first one (Fig. 91 in the foreground, B/1-3 on Fig. 88) in the next building across the N-S street.

In particular, smaller shells were usually crushed to extract the liquid quickly in order to achieve an efficient industrial use. It therefore seems that in the area under investigation, textile industries were installed in the R period. Further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the fact that a great number of loom weights were found all over the excavation. We therefore have at our disposal several strong indications that at point E/600 NW in Eretria during the R imperial period an entire part of the city was turned into installations for the textile industry, probably specialized in purple dye works. This is all the more remarkable because purple dyeing was a trade that in the R empire was at least partially under governmental control because of the greatly increasing demand for, and price of, purple-coloured cloths. In general, the information about purple dyeing and purple cloth given by Pliny, NH 9. 43. 125- 142 and Vitruvius 7. 13. 1-3 provide us with a quite precise picture about these economic and trade-related aspects. According to the finds connected with these remains, the constructions were in use at least until the 2nd Ct AD. Several.other points can be listed in order to support our theory about the function of the installations recently found at '::::: :f':" :::::_: :::::: ~ii/li :: --- :::a:: :: :::: k: : i(-i-::!i:: g:;:~I:-( i:: i...-$i:iii -i::: -:i- ii :! i *i:?: :::~: :::::: Fig. 94 Eretria. On the one hand, the best parallels for the construction of a basin with tiles as described above and shown on Fig. 91 and Fig. 93 can be found in the fullonicae of Pompeii and Ostia. It seems that the people who constructed the basins for the textile area at Eretria had a precise knowledge of what a proper R textile basin had to look like. On the other hand, information provided in anc. historical sources supports our interpretation too. Eretria, like most of Euboea, was known in antiquity for its wealth not only of cattle but also of sheep, which would have provided the wool for the different textile works. Philostratos in his description of the life of Apollonios of Tyana (1. 24. 2) further mentions diving for purple shells and even purple dyeing as typical occupations in anc. Eretria. These results are likely to change our picture of Eretria in the R period as it had been drawn previously. The installation of an area related to textile production and more precisely to purple dye works in the imperial period is not possible without a wider organization of that community. It even seems that these activities provided the inhabitants of R Eretria with a certain prosperity. In the last state of its-yet unknown-use the big basin shown on Fig. 93 was filled in with many remains of a broken mosaic floor with ornamental decoration, two of them illustrated on Figs. 94 and 95. This tesserae mosaic can be dated to the 2nd/3rd Ct AD, and although it is not yet clear where it was used originally, it testifies the economic wealth of its owner." Karystos. At the site of Agios Georgios Kabou, 2km NW of the mod. town, after the discovery of important surface finds, remains of walls and buildings of the EH period were exca- vated, including pottery (mostly incised, urfirnis and coarse impressed) and obsidian (Fig. 96). (ADelt 177-8) Manika. At the Tsotsos plot EH sherds were identified, not associated with any architectural remains, while at the Elleni- kon plot a room was discovered built of schist, and two wells, again associated with abundant EH pottery and a sealstone with a zig-zag motif.

She reports as follows: "Most of the datable pottery from the rooms excavated is of the 6th-early 5th Ct, but there is some earlier pottery. A PSC skyphos sherd was found in room 2 and an LPG jug fragment in room 4, both in contexts with later material, above the floors; there were several LG cup fragments and other LPG and G sherds mixed with later material below the floor of room 17. No pottery certainly of the 7th Ct has yet been recognized, but the material is mostly too fragmentary for certain dating. The pottery is mainly Euboean (it is not yet possible to distinguish Eretrian from Chalcidian in the A period), with a few pieces of Attic, Cor and perhaps Boeotian. It was only in room 17 that there was significant excavation below floor level. An amphora fragment from above the floor joined with one from below the floor (#32.33 with #42.47). Simple drinking vessels heavily predominated in all three rooms excavated: they were far more numerous in room 17, although only its E half was excavated. Room 4, on the other hand, had much the largest number of lamp sherds, while room 2 had a significantly smaller number of lekanides, flasks/jugs, and chytrai than room 4 and (if the numbers from above the floor are doubled) room 17. Further excavation would be of the greatest importance to establish (a) whether there are deposits below the floors in rooms 2 and 4; (b) what information can be obtained from the W half of room 17; (c) whether or not other rooms have hearths; and (d) to elucidate the problem of the 7th-Ct pottery." Skyros. Six more cist tombs were excavated at the site of the PG cemetery at Magazia, while two other cist tombs of LG-EA date are related to the Kampos-Chorafa finds (ADelt 46, 187; AR 1996-97, 58).

Vincent D6roche, Platon Petrides and Alain Badie report on work in 1997: "The excavation of the ECh SE villa in Delphi was com- pleted this year.

Fig. 97 Sections were cut the whole length of the villa in order to uncover the entire plan. The finds concern not only the occupation phase but also the period in which craft workshops (principally pottery workshops) were established in the area of the villa after its abandonment by its inhabitants. On the E side, the N and E walls of the room adjacent to the E triclinium came to light as well as walls at right angles to the N wall belonging to an older building predating the construction of the villa. In the central part of the villa and connected with the luxurious baths which had come to light in previous excava- tions, small, clearly subsidiary rooms were excavated, square or rectangular in plan. In the southernmost of these, at a level clearly earlier than the floor of the ECh villa, a roughly made elliptical construction with traces of burning, two Artemis figurines of the LA period, other pottery finds and a helmet were found. Excavation in the area round the large pithoi, which came to light in 1995 on the ground floor of the villa, was also completed; there were five in all. Next to the best preserved of them (Fig. 97) which is protected by a low party wall, we found an infant burial and two small coins, one of which the infant was holding in its hand. At this point and towards the S, traces of a road which passed in front of the villa came to light, as well as a construction of clay and plaster, which was perhaps used for the preparation of mortar for the construction of the house. In the room immediately to the W of that of the pithoi, the contents of the second shallow lekane found in 1995, were excavated. In it were found small complete vessels which had been thrown there, obviously during the course of the function- ing of the pottery workshops, and a coin of Justinian. To the S of the W triclinium new evidence for the succeed- ing construction phases of the villa came to light. This year also, the deposit of pottery was completely excavated as were the burials which were found on top of it, in the N section, which had not been excavated in 1995. Besides the large number of vessels, lamps and moulds, which were found in the deposit and which produced valuable evidence for local pottery production at Delphi during the ECh period, four kilns were also revealed, reliable proof of manufacturing activity. They are small in size and of rough-and-ready construction (Fig. 98). A bigger kiln was revealed NW of the deposit (Fig. 99). The lower section of it and the rack where they put the vessels to be fired, were preserved in a relatively good condition. For its construction, they exploited the difference of levels between</page><page sequence="66">66 DAVID BLACKMAN k v NOW *?:?4ijiAM :::"'MEWS . .. .. .. XT!, ~- ?iiii Isms: Jj?

Finally, the W edge of the villa was completely excavated, where to the E of the staircase up, installations connected with the pottery workshop were found. The many cracks in the rock show that the ground had sustained serious damage at this point." Distomos. Work was begun on the landscaping of the archae- ological park, which will include sections of the fortifications of anc. Ambrosos. Kirra. In the vicinity of the PR settlement of Kirra (ADelt 35, 255ff; 44, 206ff), in the E part of the archaeological site, the remains were excavated of two parallel apsidal houses, oriented N-S, and eight intramural cist tombs (Fig. 100). House B, which was the better preserved of the two, consisted of a rectangular main room and an apsidal rear room, with stone foundations and a mudbrick superstructure. Both architectural phases distinguished date to the LMH period (grey-yellow Minyan). This was apparently the last phase of the site of Kirra, which was destroyed by an earthquake and was then abandoned. It is significant that apsidal buildings existed at Kirra throughout the MH period. (ADelt 215-17) NORTHWEST GREECE Actium. William M. Murray (University of S. Florida, ASCS) reports on the 1997 season: "The Actium Project continued to search the sea floor at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf for evidence related to the Battle of Actium. This year, the Project focused on the area of target 136.1, located 3.3 km off the Preveza Peninsula where, in 1994, we observed items that appeared to be artifactual in nature. We were particularly interested in a number of ovoid stones (appropriate in size and shape for 1st-Ct BC catapult projec- tiles) and a few curved masses whose shapes suggested a metallic composition. We planned first to retrieve the stones, then to check the curved objects with a pulse-induction metal detector, and finally to conduct a sonar survey of the region immediately surrounding target 136.1. We attempted to accomplish these goals during a brief five-day field season in September-October 1997. Positioning and navigation: our diving and survey vessel was the fishing caique Agios Nikolaos. Positioning coordinates were provided by the global positioning system (GPS) operat- ing with the differential option (DGPS). For this option, two GPS receivers are used simultaneously, one sending corrections to the other, with a resulting accuracy of 1-3m. As in 1993 and 1994, positioning services were performed by Dr Vaios Balis of the Athenian company Geotech. On 30 September, we verified that the system was working within the defined limits (1-3m) by relocating target 136.1 with our sidescan sonar and then by verifying certain details of the target with a depth sounder. Diving operations: in 1994, our underwater robot (ROV) had photographed a number of ovoid stones in the region of target 136.1 that were roughly 12.5 cm in maximum diameter. Because of their similarity to known examples of anc. projec- tiles from small stone-throwers (known to have been used in the battle), we decided to send a team of divers to the target area to retrieve three of the stones. Since the depth of the region (57m) exceeded the limits for the safe use of com- pressed air, we utilized professionals trained to dive breathing mixed gases ('Trimix' and 'Nitrox'). Because of the limited time the divers could spend on the bottom (25 minutes), it was essential that they immediately know where they were upon reaching the bottom. The place- ment of the marker buoy was done, therefore, with great forethought and care. On the first dive, we anchored this marker at the S end of the target at position 5m W, Om N (cf. Fig. 101 ). In spite of the marker's correct placement on the site, poor visibility on the bottom (3m instead of the expected 15m) disoriented the divers and hindered them from locating any of the stones (at A, B and C on Fig. 101) and from locating the southernmost curved object (at X on Fig. 101). The second dive, begun on the next day at the opposite end of the target (at position 13m W, 27 m N) produced better results. This time, the divers progressed methodically through the target area to the curved object that had eluded them the previous day (at X on the plan). Here they found two masses whose shapes suggest they are man-made, and yet they are so encrusted with concretions that they were unable to tell if metal existed at their cores. Unfortunately, our metal detector failed to operate at this depth and so we remain uninformed concerning the composition of these curious objects. As for the ovoid stones, it appears that the regions where they were visible in 1994 have since been obscured by a layer of fine sediment. As a result, the divers again failed to recover a single stone.</page><page sequence="67">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 67 010 r r -'5 _3.'?F- 5- ' Z i TM A T oA r/ ; ~.??-.1..~.?~;7;,,, ,c~:~;~ cm -' ?~o , ?7cm T7 S Fig. 100 Apparently the process of burial con- tinues, which accounts for the poor visibility experienced by the divers on both dives. Sidescan sonar survey: the sonar record from 1994 indicated a scatter of anomalies on the sea floor immediately to the south of target 136.1. In 1997, we ran 14 additional traverses over this area (see Fig. 102) at a higher resolution than we used in 1994 (i.e. at a range of 50 instead of 100m per channel). The increased resolution revealed many curious anomalies, which must represent geological features and/or man-made debris largely buried in the bottom sediments. We hope to investigate this area more fully in the future. Sidescan services were provided by Jon B. Jolly of Seattle, Washington. Conclusion: although this year's fieldwork did not produce what we had hoped to find (catapult projectiles from the Battle of Actium), it did provide useful information relevant to questions raised by the 1994 survey. We learned from the divers, for example, that a weak current of roughly /2 knot was present on the bottom during the first dive, but not during the second one. Fluctuating currents might therefore play a role in transporting sediments into and out of the target area and this might .......................... ... ?. 35 30 .......... .......... 2 5 +20 ... .. .............. ......... . ... i .... .... .. . ..... . ............

Such an hypothesis (even if true) can only be part of the story. This year, we found clear evidence that the ancient battle zone is directly affected by the construction of a vehicle tunnel underneath the Straits of Aktion. For more than a year, bottom sediments have been excavated from the straits by mechanical cranes mounted on large floating platforms. These sediments are then loaded into barges, towed offshore toward Leukas and then dumped. While our divers struggle with poor visibility on the bottom, we watched barges being towed to a region about 7-10 km to the south of target 136.1. Our captain told us that a northward-flowing current transports these sediments over the entire region of our survey, spreading visibly cloudy water at the surface as far N as Gomaros Bay. Although the degree to which these sediments are swept from the region before they settle to the bottom is unknown to us, it is tempting to link this source of sedimentation with the poor visibility on the bottom and the relatively quick burial of stones that were visible in 1994. Pending further analysis of the videos, we still believe that these stones are catapult projectiles, that they were originally uncovered by the actions of dragnet fishing (remains of net hardware litter the target area), and that in the three-year period from 1994 to 1997 they were covered over again with sedi- ments, some of which originated from the recent dredging of the Aktion Straits. The metallic composition of the curved objects remains unconfirmed, although video images reveal extremely curious shapes for naturally occurring formations of bedrock. We believe that these heavily encrusted objects are man-made, and worth further investigation. The entire region around target 136.1 clearly requires further investigation, but so long as local dumping of sediments is continued, we feel it unwise to continue our survey. In the meantime, we will continue to search for the appropriate equipment and technology required to address the problems we encountered this year." Arta (anc. Ambrakia). The excavation of 18 building plots in 1992 and the location of antiquities in many additional places during the excavation of a new drainage network added to detailed knowledge of all aspects of anc. Ambrakia: its fortifications, public and domestic buildings, road and drainage systems, and cemeteries, from the 8th Ct BC to post-Byz/Ott. ADelt (243-78) has good plans illustrate to most of the individual sites, but a potentially useful location map (p.244) has been so reduced as to be illegible. Parts of the fortifications were found at sites Nos 183, 148, 179, 174, and in the drainage works on Mikras Asias, Zarra and Krystalle streets; those of site 148, near the Kastro, may be from an earlier nucleus of the fortifications, predating the 4th- Ct circuit to which the other finds belong. Possible remains of public buildings were uncovered by the drainage works in Eleftheriou Venizelou (massive limestone blocks, probably connected with a previously-located LA temple); Skoufa (part of an undated circular building, diam. 8.40m, in the known public area of the anc. city); and at the junction of Karaiskake and Karapanou (HL building with stepped entrance flanked by statue bases, each probably once backed by a pair of columns). A R building in site 89 just outside the SW city gate may have been commercial store- rooms, fronted by a possible public square founded somewhat earlier. Evidence for ancient housing is best illustrated at site 136, which had not suffered from the customary post-Byz pits and kilns. It contained parts of four houses, two drainage alleys and an avenue. Local 7th-Ct BC pottery underlay the lowest 6th-Ct BC floors and walls. These were succeeded by a flood level, then LC/HL buildings on the same foundations. A third phase was late HL. There was evidence that the city's road and drainage grid was established with the foundation of the Cor colony in the 6th Ct BC. In the N part of the plot, which was close to the N fortification wall, was a LHL destruction level which included large stone balls from catapults. Site 142 contained the greater part of a HL house with some room functions identifiable. Beneath HL house remains in site 156, an 8th/7th-Ct BC pottery assemblage, local and imported, suggested the equipment of a house, but no contemporary architectural remains were found. Site 165 produced many coins, mostly local, dated 238-168 BC. In the SW cemetery, site 166 contained a new section of the previously located funerary road, parts of two periboloi and three HL graves. Site 121 in the W cemetery also uncovered a length of road with two periboloi on either site. A fifth peribolos may have bordered another road, though later tombs had taken over its supposed area, and more periboloi were on its presumed far side, at the plot boundary. Tombs were 4th- 3rd Ct BC cists and some inurned cremations. Six R graves were also found, two of them 1 st-2nd Ct AD built tombs using spolia. The R tombs indicate that anc. Ambrakia was not totally deserted after the foundation of Nikopolis in 31 BC. Sites 168 and 169 were situated in the E cemetery; 168 produced part of a peribolos with 4 cists (3 inhumations, 1 cremation) which despite disturbance still retained jewellery, strigils, unguentaria and other vessels, which in one tomb were dated to the 2nd Ct BC. Two earlier pot burials, though damaged by an illegally-used mechanical excavator, also contained grave goods, the most notable being a fine 5th-Ct BC silver ring with a female head surrounded by a laurel wreath on the bezel. In 169, graves were A-HL. Seventeen were cists of various kinds, plus 3 cremations in undecorated amphorae, 2 pit graves and a tile grave. A group of cists dating to the 2nd half of the 6th Ct BC were the earliest so far found in the E cemetery. Most of the numerous fine vases they contained were imported from Corinth. Within the walls, site 170 contained a 13th-Ct AD cemetery, dated by Byz coins, and the drainage network disturbed Ott graves in Plateia Kilkis. (ADelt 243-78) Dikorfo, Zagori. Building foundations and some LR sherds were noted near the chapel of Ai-Gianni. (ADelt 291) Dodone. Ch. Soule, A.Vlahopoulou and K. Gravane report in the Ergon of the AS for 1997 (54-59) on the 1997 season: the area to the S of the Prytaneion was investigated, where one rectangular and three square rooms were discovered, correspon- ding to those located to the N of the building. Roofing material (tiles) and charcoal were identified below three clearly strat- ified layers. According to the excavators, the destruction of the building was due to fire, and was related to the destruction of Dodona by the Roman army in 167 BC. On the basis of post- destruction finds the building was used from the LHL period to the 5th Ct AD. The architectural uniformity of the N and S wings, their close links with the central wing (0), and the general uniform- ity in the masonry, suggest not only that all the units were contemporary, but also that they were part of the major building program of the Epirot Koinon. Ceremonies and rituals were apparently held in the central part of the building, while the N and S wings were used as dormitories and dining halls for the prytaneis, the archons and the official guests; it is</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 69 probable that in the S wing public archives and a mint were also housed. A section of the earlier peribolos wall of the sanctuary, built of large rectangular blocks, up to a height of 4m, was used as the E wall of the S wing of the prytaneion. Finally, sections were unearthed of the stylobate and two bases of the interior colonnade of the stoa, which continues the E stoa of the prytaneion. Gouves, Melingoi (17 km SSW of loannina). On a small plateau with a spring on the precipitous E slope of Mt Tomar- os, trial excavation in 1992 located PR levels with the remains of an open hearth, burnt bones and abundant pottery, the latter showing some similarity to Maliq I-II and the late LN and Final N of SE Albania.

Leukas to Nydri contained part of the north cemetery of anc. Leukas. The K. Vlachou-Sp. Vrettou plot produced 48 tombs, mostly sarcophagi and tile graves, dating end 6th-late 5th Cts BC. Except for a few metal objects, the majority of grave goods were bg and bf vases of many types, some from known workshops, such as those of the Haemon and Emporion painters, and portraying mythological scenes, notably Oedipus and the Sphinx on a white-ground lekythos (Fig. 104). The adjacent Chr. Logothetes plot contained three cists, a double tile grave and a sarcophagus, all HL. Like many other cist graves in the N cemetery, the cist here showed the effects of an earthquake. The plot also contained two rectangular structures of unknown purpose (1.53 x 1.08m and 1.52 x 1.59m, preserved depths 0.33 and 0.53m respectively). These were built of stones and tiles and lined with hydraulic plaster. Each had a central hollow in its floor to act as a settling tank. The structures dated 2nd-l st Cts BC, during which period the area was still being used for burials. A rescue excavation conducted on Sp. Kouniakes' plot in the teeth of harassment by the owner revealed part of a funerary road and a peribolos with Fig. 103 29 tombs dating 5th Ct BC-3rd Ct AD. The graves, some superimposed, included 12 cists, 8 tile graves, 4 sarcophagi and a few pit graves and cremations. The peribolos apparently belonged to a well-to-do family with a long tradition, as most of the cist graves were reused up to four times over extended periods (e.g. tomb 19: end 4th Ct BC-3rd Ct AD); in these earlier offerings mingled with those of later burials. Children's graves were mostly in the SW of the peribolos. Grave goods included many vases, bg to Arretine ware, but with few decorated examples and much plain ware; lamps, some with makers' stamps; figurines and dolls; numerous glass vessels; coins of all periods; jewellery and toilet articles, and domestic objects. The presence of R burials indicates that the island of Leukas was not abandoned when Nikopolis was founded.</page><page sequence="70">70 DAVID BLACKMAN 1:10 o 1 2 3 4 Fig. 104 South cemetery: Karyotes district (3 km S of mod. Leukas). In the Spasmene Vryse locality, excavation continued in 1992 in the D. and S. Vlachou plot, adding a further 15 graves to the 105 C and HL tombs uncovered in 1989-90. The new tombs, grouped in two periboloi beside a road, dated early 5th Ct-HL, and included sarcophagi, cists, a pithos, tile graves, a pit grave, etc. There were again signs of earthquake damage. Below the tombs, a deep level of hard brownish-red clay contained abundant flint tools and flakes of MPal type. The plot of G. Therianou-Moustake, within the Karyotes settlement and near the S borders of the cemetery, contained the continu- ation of a C-early HL peribolos first found in a neighbouring plot in 1970. A stone sarcophagus and two tile graves were added to its previous total of seven cist graves. Two other apparent periboloi in the plot contained not graves, but rectangular structures lined with hydraulic plaster with hollow settling tanks in the floors. Finds from these areas included iron nails, scraps of iron, a key, loomweights, a female figurine head, a bird and another zoomorphic figurine, three bronze coins and abundant HL domestic pottery. Part of a drainage system was also found. It thus seems possible that this part of the cemetery was reused (in the 3rd-2nd Cts BC) as a domestic and industrial area. In the Vas. Argyrou plot in the seaside district of Karyotes remains included fragments of funerary steles (few retaining any inscription) and many stamped amphora handles. The plot was near the S boundary of the cemetery, in an area apparently used for the storage and loading of merchandise in antiquity. (ADelt 278-89) Lygia, Katouna (6 km S of mod. Leukas). The large seaside plot of A. Fatouros, situated ca 1 km S of the walls of anc. Leukas, contained a destruction level of the 2nd Ct BC, containing remains of tiles and domestic pottery, including many stamped amphora handles. Part of a building constructed in the 1st Ct BC incorporated earlier architectural fragments and funerary steles, the latter often inscribed with a personal name and XAIPE. The excavation was to continue in 1993. (ADelt 289-91) Nikopolis. Chance finds in the extended archaeological area included a female marble statue in agricultural holding 95; part of two inscribed funerary stelai in holding 14 (Asyrmatos locality); part of a C terracotta gable with painted decoration (maeander, palmette, lotus) in holding 167; a sculptured fragment from a marble sarcophagus and part of an inscribed funerary stele in holding 253; and another inscribed funerary stele fragment from holding 227. In holding 332, SW of the R fortification wall, a R building with a visible wall in opus mixtum was noted. The corner of another building in the same technique was visible among brambles in holding 476 (Emin Arape locality). In the Kamara locality in holding 580, ruins of a possible colonnade were observed, beginning at the Nymph- aeum and ending in holding 31. In holding 9 in the Analepses locality two parallel walls running E-W and other building debris were recorded. Two complete amphoras and part of another were recovered from the sea at a depth of 120 fathoms off Mykita, in the S part of the archaeological area. (ADelt 292-3) Pharangi, Pogoni. Plain R sherds and tiles were collected in this locality. (ADelt 292) Platystoma, Leukas. The brothers D. and E. Papanikolopoulos donated to the Archaeological Service 252 figurine fragments collected from a small cave known as 'Charalave Trypa' in the Vathylakkos locality. The fragments included plank-shaped and schematic female forms, animals, satyrs and votive plaques dating 6th-3rd Cts BC. In the investigation of the cave which followed, more fragments of figurines, miniature vases and a few PR sherds were recovered. (ADelt 293) Preveza Nome Survey. J. Wiseman, K. Zachos and Fr.

The small single-aisle church of Agia Barbara, about 5 km away from the Rogon castle, was built in 1937, but investigation showed that it rested on the remains of a Byz church, which in turn rested on an ECh basilica. The</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 71 basilica was three-aisled with a single semicircular apse to the E. In a later phase the apse was buttressed by a wall to the SE, giving the exterior impression of a three-sided apse. The aisles were defined by piers. The Byz church was a smaller structure built on the remains of the central aisle of the basilica, and using the pier stylobate as a foundation course. This church had a tripartite sanctuary and was of the simple domed, four- column, inscribed-cross type. The column bases were located in the interior of the present church. Following its destruction, the site was used as a cemetery. Seven burials were found dug into the ruins of the Byz church. Finds included marble relief closure panel fragments, an Ionic column base, marble column fragments, sherds, and many tile fragments from both the basilica and Byz roofs, some with cross-shaped stamp marks. (ADelt 328-9) Strongyle (ca 15 km W of Arta). A schoolboy, A. Paliouras, handed in a large collection of sherds from the Arapospitia locality, where the stone foundations of a C building are partly visible in reeds near a marsh. The sherds included fragments from Attic and Cor bg skyphoi; other vases (some complete) and lamps; amphora necks and handles; and undecorated household pottery of the 3rd-2nd Cts BC. There is a known R villa rustica in the same locality. (ADelt 292) Syvros, Leukas. Two R cist graves were discovered in a quarry face in the Masami locality. (ADelt 293) SOUTHERN THESSALY Alonnesos. The first full season of research in 1992 on this now famous wreck is reported by E. Hatzidaki in ADelt 696-7. She described the two methods of photogrammetric survey and the first sondage, producing pottery of the late 5th Ct BC. About 1000 amphoras were counted in the surface layer, indicating a total cargo of 3-4000 amphoras, and a ship of over 100 tons displacement-a size previously thought unknown before the R period. Demetrias. Fragmentary architectural remains of HL and R/LR date (pipe, walls) were investigated at the Maroule-Zese plot and at the Alexogiannopoulos plot respectively. In the latter, under the R remains, the remains were discovered of a 2nd-Ct BC HL house, an earlier pipe and a built cistern. (ADelt 229) Dimeni. In a plot outside the E boundaries of the Myc settlement were discovered the remains of a pear-shaped pottery kiln, preserving the main chamber and part of the kiln opening (Fig. 105). The structure, originally roofed with a thol- oid roof, was internally built with mud-bricks and was strengthened on the exterior by a stone wall, only the lower part of which is preserved. Internally, it was divided into four equal spaces by three mud-brick walls, on which the pierced baking plate was laid. The pottery from the kiln and from a circular bothros/refuse pit in the vicinity, date it to the LH IIIAl1 period. A cist tomb nearby dates from the LH IIB-IIIA1 period. (ADelt 222-3) Ermetsi. Architectural remains and pottery of the LA, C and HL periods were investigated at the Grammateles plot, and there are indications of PG habitation in the area.

Fig. 105 20 miles N of Alonnesos in the report of the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Spelaeology. Test A, opened in the centre of the cave proper, had quantities of R and HL pottery, including many ER lamps, in the first stratum. Below this were successive levels of ash and burning, which yielded LN I-II sherds. In the lowest stratum were plain and decorated MN sherds, mostly from closed globular vessels. In test B, near the entrance, the top stratum contained R pottery mixed with a few N sherds. Below were MN and EN levels, a hearth, a thick layer of ash, and in the deepest (Mes) stratum, a wealth of fish bones, snails, shells, flint and obsidian tools and two large bone hooks, unique in the Aegean. The Mes stratum had C14 readings of 8,000-7,000 BC. A third test in a natural niche in the main chamber yielded C and HL sherds and vases, and it is likely that the cave was used as a shrine in these and the R periods. The bulk of the N pottery was LN I; plain monochrome pottery was burnished but not slipped; decorated pottery included white on black and red on light ground. The latter, though similar to that from Thessaly and central Greece, had unusual designs of decorative shapes set in fine net patterns, perhaps textile-related. This is known also from Agios Petros on the neighbouring island of Kyra-Panagia, but not elsewhere, suggesting a local workshop. Small numbers of white on red sherds were also found. (ADelt 691-2) Karditsa. Excavations in the mod. town revealed the remains of HL and LR walls, which illustrate the continuous use of the area throughout these periods. (ADelt 234) Myrine. The comer of a C building and the remains of an open-air workshop (slag, burnt clay, etc.) of 5th Ct BC date, were excavated at the Koinotike Odos. (ADelt 234-5) Phthiotic Thebes. Work in the 4th Ct BC-4th Ct AD theatre, situated in the N part of the anc. city, near the agora, revealed part of the cavea, the orchestra and the retaining walls of the two parodoi (Fig. 106). Part of a new, very extensive cemetery was excavated W of the hill of the anc. city, to the S of the second fortification circuit, in the vicinity of the Asklepios sanctuary. The 42 tombs, of predominantly 4th-Ct BC date, were arranged in rows and included eight cist tombs, 15 tile-roofed tombs, seven clay larnax burials and seven pit graves; among the portable finds were 16 inscribed funerary stelae, the majority HL.

Surface surveys conducted since 1990 in the area of Boulokalyva, in cooperation with the Dutch School of Archaeology, recorded the location of at least 37 tumuli, with a further 37 examples, at four other points, to the W of the HL city of Halos, all part of an extensive tumuli cemetery, practising the custom of cremation and dating from the LPG-A periods. This year two tumuli (A, B) were exca- vated 5km E of the mod. village of Platanos. Tumulus A (21.50m x 29m, ht: 2.87m) concealed a central tholos tomb and 52 burial pits with pyres, ellipsoidal, circular or horse-shoe shaped, surrounding the tholos tomb, and defining the real boundaries of the tumulus (Fig. 107). The central tholos tomb (d: 1.80m, ht 99cm), without a built entrance, contained one main burial in a hollow, associated with very burnt earth, ashes and red burnt clay. The burial pits were provided with stone walls and were full of burnt fill (charred wood). The offerings, which were broken inside the pits and in the immediate surroundings, included iron weapons and tools (swords of the Naue type, knives, spear-heads of the 9th Ct BC), bronze vessels, jewellery and seeds (grains, grapes, pomegranate). Tumulus B was identical to tumulus A, including one central tholos tomb and 43 burial pits (25 child burials). Both tumuli date from the 9th to the 8th/7th Cts BC. (ADelt 229-34) Prodromos. At Odos Agiou loannou, in the SE outskirts of the mod. village, part of the anc. cemetery was excavated, dating from the end of the 6th Ct BC to the first half of the 5th Ct BC (ADelt 39, 148; 40, 196), including four tile-roofed tombs. (ADelt 235) PHTHIOTIS Achinos. At the foot of the acropolis hill of anc. Echinos, in the area of the known HL cemetery, 15 more tombs were excavated at three different points, including nine cists (mono- lithic slabs), eight tile-roofed tombs, and five rock-cut chamber tombs, of the usual type, with a stairway down to the entrance, a square, rectangular or trapezoidal chamber, a tholos roof, and benches along the sides. Although their main period of use falls within the 2nd-ist Ct BC, their date ranges between the 3rd Ct BC and the 2nd Ct AD. A well-built, H-shaped funerary build- ing, not an intrinsic part of the cemetery itself, was probably an extra muros monument, at the W entrance of the city. At the W foot of the acropolis of Echinos, at the site of the HL cemetery (ADelt 35, 236ff; 37, 197), a Myc (LH IIB) cist tomb was excavated, built with monolithic slabs and containing one skeleton in a contracted position-a unique discovery, suggesting for the first time the existence of a Myc settlement in the area. (ADelt 186-92; Thessaliko Emerologio 30 [1996] 294-307) Atalante. Excavations in the mod. town revealed a number of remains, dating from the LHL to the LR period. These include two areas of caldaria, parts of LR baths, and three communi- cating rooms with remains of heating installations and plastered walls. In the same area was discovered part of a pear-shaped HL pottery kiln, built with A tiles. In the N part of the plot the S retaining wall of an anc. road was investigated, with a clay cylindrical pipe running parallel to it, and dating from the HL- R periods. A square well was located to the S of the road. (ADelt 197-200) Elateia. The continuation of the Greek-Austrian excavations at the site of Alonaki included landscaping of the site, to make it accessible to visitors, and the investigation of a new chamber tomb (XCI), with an irregular chamber, of LH IIIC date. On the W side of the chamber, in an ellipsoidal pit, were found bones, a steatite sealstone, a whorl and two jugs of LH IIIC date. (ADelt 207) Exarchos. Ten tombs, including eight cists, one tile-roofed tomb and one pit grave, dating from the 4th-3rd Ct BC, were discovered to the SW of Yambolis, W of the sanctuary of Apollo at Abae, while part of a rectangular building with a built bench and a cist tomb of LR/ECh date, were excavated at the site of Pelasgia, N of the mod. road to Kyparisona (Agios Taxiarches). (ADelt 195) Glypha. At the site of Phanos, work was completed on the EMyc tumulus A of Androna (ADelt 43, 222-223; 45, 172-</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 73 173). Excavations revealed the NW part of a semicircular peribolos wall and four cist tombs, radiating from the centre, of the same date (Fig. 108). The original burials in the cists were contracted, without any grave offerings or with only one pot and a few bronze objects. Both inside and outside the tumulus 22 LR pit graves were also excavated, ranged E-W, containing extended burials, again without any grave offerings or containing only metal objects (gold-silver earrings, glass beads). The final excavation season also revealed six more tombs (one original cist and five LR pit graves). (ADelt 193-4) Halai. At the cemetery of anc. Halai, at Agios Giannis Theologos two relief Megarian bowls were discovered, a rare find in E Lokris. John E. Coleman (ASCS) reports on the 1997 study season at Halai: "The summer of 1997 was largely taken up with follow-up activity after the excavations of 1996 in N levels. Study continued on animal bones and shells, chipped stone tools and pottery of the N period. We also devoted some attention to stratigraphy and finds of the HL period. With the permission of the Lamia Ephorate and the attend- ance of Eleni Zachou we also moved all of our expedition's finds from 1988-1992 from our former storeroom in Malesina to the old schoolhouse in Theologos. This building has become available for the use of the Cornell expedition through a decision of the Malesina town council. On the site, we carried out stratigraphic studies of the N levels. In accordance with an agreement made with Phanouria Dakoronia of the Lamia Ephorate, we also established paths for visitors. The paths are for the most part set off from the rest of the site by ropes attached to metal posts. Wooden bridges and steps were constructed in places so that visitors could safely view the site." Hypate. At the Sarandare site, a HL cist tomb was excavated, with pseudo-isodomic walls (2nd Ct BC), to the S of the Macedonian-type tomb of the same period (ADelt 33, 137, 147ff). In the course of road works connected with the military installations in the area, architectural remains were revealed of a well-built LR building, including a cistern. (ADelt 197) At Odos Syndagmatarhou I. Papakyriaze, part of a rock-cut, kiln-like construction was investigated, of R-LR date (diam: 2.40m, pres. ht: 2.35m), in the W side of the plot; to its N was located the comer of a room with a white plaster floor, part of a stone staircase against a wall, the comer of a LR mosaic floor and remains of a large rectangular building, divided in two parts. It included the remains of a network of three clay pipes and a circular pit, associated with HL pottery and six bronze Aitolian coins (279-168 BC). Fragments of a clay mould for Megarian skyphoi were also recorded in the area. (Thessaliko Emerologio 30 [1996] 312-14) Kalyvia. A new A-R cemetery was located 3km from Lamia, at the exit of the Bikiorema, where a group of Myc chamber tombs had been located in the past (ADelt 33, 136). All the tombs, except one chamber tomb, were tile-roofed and hut- shaped, and some were reused in the 1st Ct BC. At the site of Tymbanos, near the Bikiorema, were investi- gated two PG chamber tombs, a series of degenerate Myc type chamber tombs, with oval chambers and rudimentary entrances.

Cleaning operations revealed that the isodomic HL fortification wall of the anc. town, on the W side of the excavations, was built over LH remains, which in itself suggests that the LH settlement extended to the base of the hill (ADelt 45, 177ff.). In trench A, a LH IIIC storeroom with mud-brick walls was apparently destroyed at the end of the IIIC period, while at another point a LH IIIC corridor was discovered full of destruction debris; among the finds were fragments of figured craters with representations of warships. Everywhere on the site LH IIIC buildings overlay LH IIIB architectural remains (walls, floors); both phases ended with fire/earthquake destructions (two skeletons buried under stones). Parts of LH IIIB walls were discovered in other areas of the excavation. In trench B one more MH cist tomb was investigated. (ADelt 208-11) Kyrtone. Renewed illegal activities in the area of the Myc cemetery of Agios Giannis (ADelt 43, 226; 44, 172; 45, 176- 177; 46, 195) revealed the existence of two more looted chamber tombs, with rectangular chambers, long dromoi with converging walls, and finds which included pottery, Myc Phi figurines, buttons, beads and a sealstone of glass paste. (ADelt 204-5) Lamia. In addition to isolated tombs, including four cists and one rock-cut chamber tomb of HL date, rescue excavations in the mod. town revealed sections of the SE cemetery of the anc. city, also of HL date, at Odos Alamanas 23 and at Odos Papakyriaze, including a total of nine cist tombs of the 3rd-2nd Ct BC. Some of the tombs preserved traces of painted plaster on the interior and two examples preserved the remains of a wooden bier. Three more cist tombs, part of the same cem- etery, dating from the end of the 4th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct BC (leaves of gold wreath), were discovered at the junction of Odos Papakyriazi and Skoufa. Of HL date were also a cistern and sections of drainpipes, part of the water-supply system of the anc. city, at Plateia Eleutherias and at Odos Gregoropoulou 11. Finally, mod. drainage works revealed part of the city's fortification wall and one of its towers, the W side of which was built in a rectangular isodomic style, and was dated to the end of the 4th Ct BC. The continuation of the external dia- teichisma of Lamia, also of the 4th Ct BC, was excavated at the junction of Odos Palaiologou and Alkibiadou.

Fig. 109 Livanates. In the course of road works on the coast at Livana- tes, the architectural remains of ER subterranean structures built in pseudo-isodomic masonry were discovered, including both rooms and rock-cut staircases used for storage and other agricultural activities (Fig. 109). The structures, which can be dated to the 2nd-Ist Ct BC, suffered a violent destruction by fire, while parts of their walls were reused in the 3rd Ct AD. Finds include a hoard of bronze coins, domestic storage pottery, seeds, marble querns, etc. At the site of Farmake Rema, lkm SW of Livanates, part of a Myc chamber tomb (LH IIIB-C) was investigated, indicating the existence of a chamber tomb cemetery in the area. (ADelt 204-5) Megale Kapse. On the NE slope of Agios Panteleimon hill, near the entrance to the mod. village, the remains were investigated of at least three LHL/ER houses or storerooms (four rooms and part of a fifth on either side of an anc. road), destroyed by fire; the discovery suggests the existence of a hitherto unknown anc. settlement in the area of the Spercheios springs, S of the defensive axis of the Palaiokastro-Rendina line. (ADelt 194-5) Melitaia. Illegal activities S of the acropolis of anc. Melitaia revealed the existence of four tombs (three tile-roofed, one cist tomb), of the mid-4th Ct BC and of the HL period, resp- ectively. In the same area were excavated parts of LHL-ER houses on either side of a narrow paved road. At the Marmara site part of a large rectangular stoa-like building was investigated, consisting of four rectangular rooms; finds in the area include parts of a poros epistyle, a marble statue-base, R pottery and a hoard of 39 bronze and silver coins. (ADelt 195-7; Thessaliko Emerologio 30 [1996] 308-12) Mexiates-Archani. In addition to a partly destroyed HL chamber tomb of the usual type, at the Tsatsara site, S of the Archani village, a R pithos burial was discovered. (ADelt 193) Modi. Three A pithos burials were investigated 2km SW of the mod. village, while rescue excavations due to road works at the Agios Athanasios site, 1km SE of Modi, revealed a total of eight tombs (three pithos burials, five cist tombs), of a LPG date (9th Ct BC). (ADelt 200-1) Neo Monasteri. In the course of works for the mod. water supply system of the town a number of tombs, architectural remains and part of the fortification system were revealed around the Tapsi hill, which suggests that occupation in the area can be traced from EH times down to the C period. The Myc period is represented by a tholos tomb of LH IIIA2/B date, S of the hill, and a LH IIIB 1 cist tomb with one skeleton in a contracted position. In the ditch surrounding the hill were found the remains of a collapsed tholos tomb of PG date, containing two burials; one of the dead was buried clothed, in an extended position (jewellery). From the C period a small part of the fortification system (5th Ct BC-mid 4th Ct BC) survives, and parts of anc. houses (end of 5th Ct BC-end of 4th Ct BC). (ADelt 206-7) Rengini. Two tombs were investigated 350m SSW of the acropolis of anc. Naryka, identified with the home of the Homeric hero, Ajax the Lokrian (ADelt 6, 142; 10 Suppl., 1 ff.), a LR built tomb (5th Ct AD) and a 3rd-2nd Ct BC chamber tomb, with a trapezoidal chamber and a pointed tholos roof. At the site of Pisorema, four pithos burials were exca- vated, belonging to a hitherto unknown 3rd-Ct BC Lokrian cemetery. (ADelt 201-2) Stylis. Road works on Odos Karkale revealed part of a complex of HL baths (3rd Ct BC) and the NE continuation of the fortification wall of anc. Phalara (ADelt 38, 159). The wall, preserved for a length of 7m, was built in the rectangular isodomic style, and was associated with a tower at its SW end. The bath complex was plastered on the interior and included the remains of a stone bath tub at the S end. At Odos Lamias 65 illegal activities brought to light the remains of two EHL buildings (end of 4th Ct BC), possibly parts of two houses, separated by a stone paved area, which continues beyond them. (ADelt 192-3; Thessaliko Emerologio 30 [1996] 307-8) Tragana. An unknown Myc cemetery was located, owing to illegal excavations, 1km SSW of the mod. village of Tragana. Two chamber tombs, cut in the N slope of the hill, were investigated, one ellipsoidal, the other trapezoidal in plan. Finds included the usual pottery, steatite buttons, and glass beads. (ADelt 205-6) Zeli-Golemi-Agios Georgios. After renewed illegal excava- tions at the site of the Myc cemetery at Agios Georgios (ADelt 40, 16ff.; 43, 225-226; 44, 170ff.) one more chamber tomb was investigated. It included a long, wide dromos with converging walls, and pottery of LH IIIB 1-2 date.

Three new trenches were opened. In H7 and H8, in the centre of the cave towards the entrance, a separate level of hard yellowish grey-brown earth containing Mes microliths was found below the usual N fill and directly above the hard sedimentary Upper Pal deposit. Mes artifacts, the first to be found in Thessaly, had been previously discovered in the cave,</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 75 Fig. 110 but never before in so distinct a stratum. Two samples from it gave C14 dates of 8,405-8,138 and 12,055-11,758 BC. The third new trench, A8, at the E edge of the cave, produced a com- plete figurine, unrelated to Thessalian types and perhaps a Balkan import. It came from LN fill. Work continued in previously-opened trenches in Upper Pal levels, below the sedimentary deposit which marks the latest stage of this period. This stratum, which ended at another, lower, layer of sediment, produced a few stone tools, bones, and small mounds of raw clay clearly formed into cylindrical shapes. In trenches towards the back of the cave, burnt surfaces of striking red earth were reached, with a black layer of burning below them. These were preserved in situ. Three trenches in the E part of the central group which had reached MPal in 1991 were continued, producing many stone tools of excellent quality. A reddish sediment was encountered, equivalent to that in the central tests. C14 tests in the latter gave dates of 36,827 ? 845 and 33,086 ? 1,573. The earliest C,4 date obtained from the cave so far is 39,415 ? 3,914 BP, but as the sample for this was taken at a point where at least a further metre of fill remained, earlier dates are to be expected.

Work of the PR and C Ephorate: Within the walls. In AEMTH 10, 491-99, G. Velenis discusses the town planning of anc. Thessalonike in the light of recent excavation results. Agora (AR 1996-97, 64). In 1992 during a nine-month season, excavation continued here in areas around and to the SE of the odeion, E of the site entrance and S of the present guard-house, and S of the cryptoporticus. Stratification and remains had a date range of 2nd Ct BC-7th Ct AD. Conservation and restoration of the central paving continued. (ADelt 364). By 1997, the excavation programme had been completed. In AEMTH 10, 501-31, P. Adam-Veleni and her associates review the stratigraphy of the main areas. Work in 1995-96 concen- trated on the SE of the site, outside the agora proper, and here at the end of 1996 was discovered part of a caldarium with individual baths ranged in a circle (AEMTH 10, cover illustra- tion); these were covered by a fill dating to the 2nd Ct AD. The article includes preliminary studies of some categories of HL-R pottery and finds. Plateia Dioiketeriou (Plateia Kyprion Agoniston). In AEMTH 10, 545-57, A. Tasia, Z. Lola, A. Bachlas and A. Stangos describe the work of the PR and C Ephorate since 1991 in Thessalonike's third largest archaeological site. The chief remains were those of the SW and central parts of a very large, probably public building ranged round a central peristyle courtyard measuring 24 x 12m. This was built in the 1st Ct BC and remained in use for 150 years. It was founded on the remains of a LHL building on a somewhat different orientation. Below this were slight remains and finds contemporary with the foundation of Thessalonike. There were indications that buildings in this part of the city had always been of a public, perhaps administrative, character. Other details are noted in AR 1996-97, 64-65, and refs. The R building remains at Krystalle 17 (ADelt 364) have been covered in AR 1996-97, 65, based on AEMTH 6. At Apellou 5, a further part of the open area within the LR 'theatre called stadium' was uncovered, and the plot was to be expropriated. Remains of the stadium had previously been recog- nized in this plot and the neighbouring Apellou 7 (ADelt 363-4). Suburbs Ano Toumba: the Table. In 1992 building plots were investi- gated here at Dryos 9, Elaias 13, Lotou 11, Lotou 13 and the corner of Agiou Protoleontos and Philomelas (ADelt 367-73). The plot at Lotou 13 had building remains of the ?9th, 7th and 6/5th Cts BC and sherds of 10th-5th Cts BC (Fig. 110). A summary of the results to 1993 appears in AR 1996-97, 65-66, based on AEMTH 6 and 7. In AEMTH 10, 389-406, K. Soueref draws general conclusions from the 33 plots excavated in this thickly-settled suburb under the headings of topography, stratigraphy and settlement phases, buildings and building materials, and pottery and other finds. The Table was occupied from the EIA (ca 1,100 BC) to EHL (ca 300 BC). LBA remains were found only at Dryos 10. The abandonment of the town probably coincided with the foundation of Thessalonike. The cemetery was to the E and S of the settlement, and tombs</page><page sequence="76">76 DAVID BLACKMAN dated ca 800-300 BC. Graves were usually rectangular pits cut in the natural clay or rock. Cists and stone sarcophagi were also found; pot burials and cremations were rare. Much of the cemetery has probably been lost to flooding in the local ravines and to the foundations of apartment blocks. The Toumba. In AEMTH 10, 369-87, S. Andreou and K. Kotsakis summarise the occupation phases and associated pottery sequences at this University of Thessalonike site, where excavation began in 1984. Ten phases have been distinguished so far, covering a period from the late 3rd/early 2nd millennium BC until the end of the 4th Ct BC. Phase 1 at present covers the vestigial remains from the early 9th to the late 4th Cts BC; phases 2 and 3 are dated provisionally to the l lth-10th Cts BC; phases 4 and 5, which have the most informative architectural and other remains (see AR 1996-97, 66 and refs.) date to within the 12th Ct BC and ca late 14th- early 12th Cts BC respectively. The earlier BA phases 6-10 are known chiefly from successive changes in the area of a single building on the SW slope. A destruction by fire here at the end of phase 8 was useful in preserving seeds stored in baskets, wooden beams, etc. An interesting feature of the site is a casemate wall about half-way up the Toumba's side. Its rectangular compartments were built of mud-brick and filled with earth and building debris. Its original construction probably pre-dates the 14th Ct BC, and it was maintained till the end of the LBA. Polichne: Lembet Toumba. The results of the excavations at S. Venizelou 30 (ADelt 364-7) are referred to in AR 1996- 97, 66, based on AEMTH 7. Stavroupoli. A C stone sarcophagus was discovered in Pasteur St, near Koundouriote Square, during the excavation of a new channel for waste water. It contained a few bones, a bg skyphos, a pyxis and a lekythos, a bronze bowl, five arched bronze brooches, four bone discs with bronze attachments, possibly from a small wooden chest, and two iron objects. Along the length of Pasteur St from Dangli St to Koundouriote Square, where the N settlement of Stavroupoli is located, a thick stratum of red earth visible in the sides of the new channel produced sherds of the early LN period; no undisturbed N strata were encountered, however, which suggests that Pasteur St is on the outer edge of the N settlement. (ADelt 373-4). Xerokrene. In a plot on the comer of Margaropoulou and Veratiou Sts, near the railway station and in the area of the W cemetery of anc. Thessalonike, 31 R tombs were discovered when an old building was demolished. They were on two levels, 1.60 and 3.50m below the footpath. Most were rec- tangular with vaulted ceilings. Some were in groups of two or three with party walls and periboloi. One had a stepped entrance, an ante-chamber, and two marble couches in the chamber. Most had been destroyed and filled in to provide a stable foundation for the old building. Finds from the fill suggested a 2nd-4th Cts AD date. (ADelt 375-6) Work of the Byzantine Ephorates: AEMTH 10 A &amp; B, 1996 reports the 'rescue excavations and systematic digs carried out in Thessalonike in recent years which necessitate the re-examination of certain issues con- nected with the topography and town-planning of the city', in particular the ancient forum (AEMTH 501-22, with analytical discussion of the many small finds), Dioikitiriou square (HL and R, 545-58, and ECh and Byz, 559-71, including a M 9th- Ct glass workshop) and the Palace of Galerius (533-44, relating the HL and R phases of substantial buildings under the palace). A useful survey of 10 ECh villas with triclinia appears in AEMTH 571-86. The apsidal triclinium is associated with later developments in Byz architecture, such as the plan of monastic refectories on Mt Athos. A detailed discussion is given of the Byz bath house on Theotokopoulou St in AEMTH 587-98. The baths, the only well-preserved Byz examples in Greece, are MByz in date and used the walls of an earlier structure. Reports continue of extensive Byz remains found during construction work in the city. These include some important tombs: 12 vaulted 4th-6th Ct tombs with fragmentary painted decoration of crosses and birds on the Axios site on Langada St (ADelt 425); 76 burials on the same street including pottery, glassware, jewellery and a coin hoard of the 3rd-4th Ct (ADelt 437); painted vaulted chamber tombs at 13 Apolloniados St and elsewhere, including the site of the new Byzantine Museum). New evidence for the LR and EByz drainage and water supply system also came to light. (ADelt 424, 430-32, 433, 440) A small EByz bath complex was investigated at 90 Kassan- drou St, dated by 4th-Ct coins and the fragmentary mosaic floor of the frigidarium. (ADelt 428) A large LR/ECh public building was investigated at Kyprion Agoniston 7-9, including two rooms with fine mosaic floors decorated with geometric motifs. The atrium was laid with an opus tessellatum floor. A destruction layer (earthquake?) preceded a Justinianic phase, which in turn was followed by a MByz phase and a final Ott layer. (ADelt 429-30) At 74 Olympiados St, phases were found of structures extending from ER to modem times. There appears to have been a workshop here (tanning, dyeing?) during the Tetrarchy, followed by a phase including an ornate mosaic floor (geomet- ric motifs) in the second quarter of the 5th Ct (similar mosaic motifs have been found in the priest's house at the Asklepeion in Epidauros). A 7th-8th Ct. phase was also identified, along with complex modifications and rebuilding extending right up to Ott times, when cisterns were opened at the site. (ADelt 430-2) Excavations SE of the 14th-Ct church of Prophetes Ilias brought to light walls of large buildings that may have been associated with the original monastery. A large MByz structure (church?) lay below the LByz remains and in turn covered a vaulted chamber, probably contemporary. Remains of an ECh structure were also found on the natural rock in the vicinity. These included a mosaic floor and fragments of non-figural wall paintings. This may have been the original building from which came the spolia used in and around the church. (ADelt 421-4) HL and Byz secular buildings (houses?) were encountered at 17 Euripidou St. An ECh phase used spolia from a R structure for a lavish building with mosaic and marble floors and marble wall revetments. Finds included much pottery from HL to Ott, and some 24 coins. (ADelt 433-36) Elaborate mosaic floors were uncovered in the Evangelistria cemetery in a corridor of part of an as yet unidentified struc- ture (probably not a church) associated with a nearby ECh cemetery complex. The site also contained the remains of elaborate conduits which may have originally supplied the city with water. (ADelt 439-40) Investigations in the sanctuary apse of the Rotonda uncovered traces of the earliest floor, probably originally laid with marble slabs, which predated the construction of both the Byz synthronon and the altar. (ADelt 440-1) Nome of Thessalonike Agia Paraskeve (ca 16km SE of Thessalonike). During excavation of foundation pits in the Gialopoulou holding, No. 567, SE of the mod. settlement, four LC tombs were found, probably belonging to the same cemetery as the district's</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 77 ji !i ... Fig. 111 Macedonian tomb. They were very large rectangular pits cut into the natural red clay, lined with white plaster, and covered with three stone slabs. There were cuttings to receive the biers. All the tombs were oriented E-W, with the heads of the deceased to the E. Finds included gold and some silver jewellery, gilded bronze and clay wreaths, a bronze oinochoe, clay female protomes, clay unguentaria, a kantharos in West Slope ware, and a number of coins. (ADelt 377) Agios Athanasios (20km WNW of Thessalonike). This mod. settlement has four mounds in its vicinity, the N-HL settlement of Topsin Toumba and a tumulus with a Macedonian tomb to its NW, and two more tumuli to its E. In 1992 a long-term project to excavate these antiquities was begun, with the object of creating one of several archaeological parks on the approach roads to Thessalonike, to coincide with Thessalonike's term as Cultural Capital of Europe in 1997. The excavation of the NW tumulus in 1992-93, where a largely A cemetery was discovered under the later mound (ADelt 376-7) has already been covered (AR 1996-97, 66-7 and refs.). One of the two Chiot chalices found here is illustrated (Fig. 111). M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti, reporting on the whole project in AEMTH 10, 427-42, describes the excavation of the large tumulus to the E of the town in 1994. Here the first discoveries were two intact late 4th/early 3rd Ct cist tombs with rich and unusual grave goods. One was the burial of a warrior, the other the cremation of a woman, whose ashes, together with a gold ring, had been wrapped in gold and purple cloth and placed in a small silver-plated wooden larnax. In the centre of the tumulus was a single-chamber Macedonian tomb, robbed in antiquity, but still retaining a painted fagade in a superb state of preser- vation. Its most important element is the now-famous frieze with the remarkable symposium scene including Macedonian soldiers with unique helmets and distinctive shields (AR 1996- 97, 67 and ref.). The occupant of the tomb was himself probably of high military rank-among scattered finds over- looked by the robbers were fragments of weapons, ivory decorations from a funerary couch and a gold coin of Philip II.

Anc. Arethousa (S of road through Rendina pass, W of Byz Rendina). ADelt 378-9 reports the 1992 excavation of part of the W fortification wall and the C-HL cemetery. A female grave in the latter included an unusual clay protome of a woman crowned with a garland of flowers, which retained polychrome decoration (Fig. 112). Other results have been covered in AR 1996-97, 67, based on AEMTH 6. Asprobalta. Remains of a five-sided Byz enclosure wall (up to 4m high and 1.70m thick) was tentatively identified with the xenodocheion of Agios Nikolaos, known from documentary evidence as belonging to an estate of the Petritzos monastery of Gregory Pakourian (typikon of 1083). Pottery, a hand- powered mill and an anonymous follis of 1060 were found in an adjacent ruined cistern. (ADelt 441) A Byz fortification some 500m from the same site was located after a scrub fire on the heights of the 'Kaledes' site. It appears to have overlooked and guarded the Via Egnatia at this point. The walls are greatly ruined but part of the acropolis and the cisterns are better preserved.

Wardle (BSA) discusses the evidence for change or continuity at the transition from the BA to IA at Assiros Toumba in AEMTH 10, 443-60. He reports on work in 1997: "Preparation of the first volume of the report on the IA levels continues, while nearly 20 charcoal samples dating between 1300 and 900 BC have been submitted for dendrochronological determination. The trees on the Toumba and part of the roofing of the site were seriously damaged by a fire in June; and the School has contributed to the (tempor- ary) repair work carried out by Ephoreia and KotvwOtrt. A final solution on re-roofing still has to be decided." Derveni. In AEMTH 10, 461-76, K. Tzanavari describes the project of developing this HL cemetery (associated with anc. Lete) into one of several archaeological parks situated on the approach roads to Thessalonike, to coincide with Thessalo- nike's term as Cultural Capital of Europe in 1997. The Langadas Macedonian tomb excavated by Macridy Bey in 1910 was in imminent danger of collapse, and part of its tumulus had to be removed to prevent this. It was shored up and its dromos excavated. Similar work was done on Macedonian tomb r', found a short distance to the E during the 1962 excavation, which also located the four unlooted cist tombs for which the cemetery is chiefly known. The re-study of a 'building' found then showed it to be another Macedonian tomb, with two chambers, but with its vault missing and parts of its walls robbed to floor level. Near this were a previously- undiscovered cist and a stone container for a cremation. Both had been robbed in antiquity, but the cist retained some finds and had a plastered, finely decorated interior. This and the newly-recognized Macedonian tomb are dated to the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC. Epanorme. Trials in holding No. 8046 located two 4th-Ct BC tombs belonging to the area's known C cemetery. One was a cist tomb containing a child, accompanied by a lekythos and figurines of a seated woman, a dove and a tortoise. The other was a pit grave covered by three stone slabs. The deceased had a bronze pendant. (ADelt 378) Kalamoto. Tests on the probable site of anc. Kalindoia are reported in ADelt 378. These results were noted in AR 1996-97, 67, based on AEMTH 6.

Nea Anchialos. In AEMTH 10, 407-25, Prof. M. Tiberios summarises the results of the University of Thessalonike's excavations since 1990 at the double table of Anchialos, which may be anc. Sindos. Much of this has been noted in AR 1996- 97, 67-8, based on AEMTH 6 and 7. Other interesting aspects are evidence for metal-working from at least the 9th Ct BC, including crucibles retaining traces of copper; and such a predominance of Euboean pottery amongst G imported wares as to suggest the possible establishment of a Euboean entrep8t in the 8th Ct BC. One of the attractions may have been the alluvial gold of the nearby Gallikos (anc. Echedoros) river. Ossa (15km NE of Langadas). The results of the 1992 season at this small LC-HL town in ADelt 381-2, have been covered in AR 1996-97, 68, based on AEMTH 6. Rentina. A comprehensive survey of the work done over the last decade or so at this most important Byz fortified town is given in AEMTH 10, 605-35. Discussion of houses, work- shops, water supply and fortifications indicates a date of origin during Justinian I (527-65) and reoccupation in the mid-10th Ct. Occupation continued down to Ott times, Stavros. Road-widening activities at Melies, 1.5km S of Stavros, struck two R cist tombs constructed of marble slabs, which produced pottery, a lamp, jewellery and coins.

To these may be added the torsos of two R male statues built into a wall and another found during the clearance of a stone heap. (ADelt 389-90) Palaio Gynaikokastro (13km SW of Kilkis). Excavations were continued in the EIA cemetery here in 1992 after a four- year break. In two trenches to the S of the previous excavations, nine more tombs were located, bringing the number to 51, and 56 pots were found, making a total of 413. The tombs were the usual stone heaps, their form largely destroyed by ploughing, enclosing inurned cremations (Fig. 113). (ADelt 390) Palatianos (ca 10km SE of Kilkis). In AEMTH 10, 189-204, I. Anagnostopoulou-Hatzipolychroni describes developments since 1993, when a second herotn was excavated (see AR 1996-97, 68-69, based on AEMTH 7). The site is in a strategic position on two hills between the Gallikos and Krousia rivers, with a rich hinterland. On the E side of the N hill, on either side of the two heroa, buildings and a major road of a city founded in the 1st Ct AD are coming to light, with much interesting architectural detail, and many portable finds. This was apparently destroyed in the 3rd Ct AD. It was built on the ruins of a HL settlement, destroyed in the 1st Ct BC. This was constructed on an artificial fill containing local and imported sherds of the 8th-6th Cts BC. After the latest destruction, the area was sporadically used for 4th-Ct AD burials.

Cemetery: in 1992, three building plots (Nos. 121, 122 and 140) produced 673 burials, bringing the total to 6,993. The tombs dated LA-R and were of the customary types (see AR 1996-97, 69 and refs.). A robbed HL cist tomb was found outside the boundary of the organized cemetery, beside the new OTE building in the centre of lerissos (ADelt 386-7). In AEMTH 10, 297-312, E. Trakosopo- ulou-Salakidou notes briefly that by the end of 1996, the number of burials had risen to 9,040, and that in plot No. 180, burials of six horses and four dogs were found amongst 183 human interments. At the E end of the beach, a workshop area with at least two HL? pottery kilns was discovered beside the apse of a large ECh basilica; unfortunately the kilns were largely destroyed by Med burials. Anc. city. During the last few years there has been a combined project involving both the PR and C, and the Byz Ephorates, and the local authorities of lerissos, aiming to uncover and present both anc. Akanthos and Med lerissos. The ruins are located on several connected hills. The discovery of IA and possibly BA remains below a Byz church has already been noted (AR 1996-97, 69 and refs). Two building periods could be discerned in the fortifica- tions. The earlier, of roughly-dressed but well-fitted granite blocks on the E side of the Kastro, still stands 8m high, and can be traced for 30m. The later phase (ca LC/EHL?) was chiefly of rectangular limestone blocks. Parts of this circuit, including at least one rectangular tower or gate, have been noted on the two hills SE and S of the Kastro, and chiefly on the larger S hill, Sta Alonia. On the latter hill the foundations of a temple of full hekatompedon size were discovered, but so robbed out and in a deposit so shallow, that nothing is known so far of the dedication or even the date. On the lower NW slope of the Kastro, just within the NW entrance to the city, a HL building with a peristyle court was first located by tests in 1983-4, but the excavation was recently extended. The court retained its floor of rectangular marble slabs. In its centre was a well, with the well-head preserved intact. The well cutting was lined with successive clay rings. On the edge of the court, a similiar well-head was set over a large pithos, to collect rain water. This well-head was broken and a small Ionic column lay across it. Rooms to the S of the court had at least one wall decorated with painted plaster. One of the rooms had contained pithoi and may have been a store. Cleaning outside the W exterior wall of the building located a large pithos store, apparently in use from the LIA. In 1996, the foundations of a well-constructed building were discovered about 600m N of the Kastro. It was on the same NW-SE orientation as the tombs in the neighbouring cemetery. The stereobate and one course of granite blocks were pre- served; the upper surfaces of the latter were joined by lead- coated iron clamps. It was built in a very early part of the cemetery, with LIA or EA burials. Among the few finds were part of a marble (lion's?) mane, fragments of an Ionic column, and bronze coins of the late 5th Ct BC. The purpose of the building remained uncertain. Kallithea: Solenas Hill. A rescue excavation in holding No. 182A located an anc. fortification wall on the N side of this hill, which could be followed for a length of ca 100m. The few sherds found suggested a LC/EHL construction date. (ADelt 384) Nea Roda. In AEMTH 10, 333-46, E.-B. Tsigarida gives an account of results from the sanctuary near here, the excavation of which began in 1990. The LA temple with the Nike akroteria and part of a large, probably public, EHL building to the SE of it have already been noted (AR 1996-97, 69-70, and refs.; see also ADelt 387). Between the two an EHL temple has now been discovered. All three buildings follow the same orientation. There is no evidence which divinity was worship- ped in the LA temple, but finds from the EHL complex suggest that the main deity then was Helios or Apollo-Helios. The LA temple probably belonged to anc. Sane. Its EHL restoration and the erection of the other buildings are attributed to the foundation of Ouranopolis by Alexarchos, brother of Cassan- der, in 315 BC. A 5th-Ct BC fragmentary inscription, possibly a boundary stone, is the only indication of the continuity of the sanctuary between LA and EHL. Nea Syllata. In AEMTH 10, 313-332, T. Pazaras reviews the literary and topographical evidence for identifying the site of the Med castle of Vrya (mod. Veria) with the anc. Beroea or Brea. He combines the evidence of rescue excavations in building plots on flat areas to the E and particularly to the W of the castle since 1978 to demonstrate that after scanty HL-ER remains, there was a flourishing LR-ECh settlement. There is no evidence for the 7th-9th Cts AD. In the late 10th/early 1 Ith Cts AD, the castle mound and its W slopes were reoccupied, the area being much smaller and more thickly settled than before. The site was abandoned in the late 12th or early 13th Ct AD. The same E-W orientation of all buildings was maintained throughout the site's history. Details of individual plots and buildings have been given previously (AR 1996-97, 70 and Site Index). In 1993-95 systematic excavations were undertaken to locate and study the castle fortifications. Part of the W wall with a major gate was uncovered, and four building phases were distinguished. The main phase was MByz, at least partly on LR foundations. Anc. Olynthos. A report on the 1992 season of excavation and restoration on the N hill here in ADelt 391-2 has already been noted in AR 1996-97, 70, based on AEMTH 6.

ADelt 386 has a report on the 1992 season here. This and the 1993 season have been covered in AR 1996-97, 71, based on AEMTH 6 and 7. In AEMTH 10, 279-95, K. Sismanides reviews the remarkable discoveries at this site since 1990. It is situated on a peninsula consisting of two hills connected by a saddle (Fig. 117). The earliest, A, settlement, a colony of Andros, was on the N or seaward hill, and an important recent discovery was part of its fortification wall, lying along and to the S of the Byz. cross- wall which was one of the few visible features before the excavation began. In the vicinity of one of its towers, a major gate of the A fortifications may have been found, including two sculptured panels probably fallen from its lintel. These show the bodies of a lion and a wild boar (the latter the symbol of anc. Stageira). On the summit of the N hill was a Med fortification and tower, with a large cistern built of well- cut granite blocks beneath its plaster. Similar blocks had been noted in reuse elsewhere in the Byz. complex. The blocks proved to have been taken from a large 6th-Ct BC temple, also : : :-r .. . .... ...... .iii~: :-': :::: .. .........: : :; :: ?: i? : -:: Fig. 117 dx: Fig. 118 on the summit of the N hill. 30m of one of its long sides had been uncovered by the end of 1996. It may have been of the Doric order, and two A sculpture fragments, both human heads, may have come from it. Other A religious buildings on the N hill were a sanctuary, probably dedicated to Demeter, and a circular Thesmophorion. By ca 500 BC, space on the N hill had become insufficient, and the impressive and extraordinarily well-preserved EC city wall was built from shore to shore over the summit of the S hill (Fig. 118). Torone. Prof. A. Cambitoglou (Australian Institute) reports on the 1997 season: "The third and last underwater digging season in the harbour, carried out in collaboration with the Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities, was directed by Mrs Chryssa Samiou and Dr Tom Hillard. 1997 marked the end of fieldwork by the present team, whose duty now is to concentrate on publication of the excavations; the underwater research at Torone was a postscript to the research done on land since 1975. The harbour of Torone lies immediately to the E of the Lekythos, or Promontory (Fig. 119). The 1997 investigation challenged our suppositions about the layout of the harbour, based on our earlier land research and experience. We became especially interested in the shoreline of Torone following a preliminary underwater survey in 1991. In antiquity the city was noted as a port flourishing on its wine and timber com- merce, inter alia. A marvellous find from the Isthmus of the Lekythos, a lead letter placing an order for timber (Fig. 120), shows that trade in the area was brisk.</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 81 promo ory3 promon ory 27 C K2 ', vigla b- torone 1984 Fig. 119 Already during the first two seasons (1993 and 1994), it had become clear that within the harbour as it appears today we were not investigating immediately offshore an area of the harbour of the ancient city, but an area which was only partly submerged in antiquity. On our underwater map (Fig. 121) one can see the lines of several walls on the sea bottom which run in a SW-NE direction. This is the direction in which run most of the houses of the city dug on land in previous years, which suggests that the walls found at the bottom of the sea were originally built on terra firma. This interpretation is supported by two lines of beachrock also located on the sea bottom, which run, at a distance from each other, more or less parallel to the present shoreline (Fig. 121: a and b). A line of ashlar blocks lies along a stretch of the outer beachrock called feature 2. This is the most remarkable underwater feature on the site so far uncovered (Fig. 122). The blocks are shaped but irregular; only one course remains and appears to have been built into the beachrock. A layer of beachrock had apparently formed to the landward side of this feature after its construction. The upper surface of these blocks was level. Given the relatively rapid rate at which beachrock forms (10-15 years), it is hoped that samples extracted in the future from each of the matrices above and behind the ashlar masonry will provide some indication of its date. Topography suggests a maritime facility. Beachrock is the result of a process of lithification which can occur in certain circumstances at beaches between the lower and the upper tidal lines. Of the two beachrock lines, the one nearest to the present shoreline is at a distance of about Qj -TET-F - A [- P?

Torone's shoreline at some stage of its history must have been firstly 20 and secondly 40m farther out to sea. The most likely explanation for these changes of relative sea level is seismic action. The question is at what point in Torone's history might these dramatic alterations to the topography have occurred. According to Thucydides the isthmus of the Lekythos was narrow. The dating of beachrock itself is problematic. A useful, if relative, chronological indicator was provided during the excavation of 1997: at the line of the present shore a large pithos buried upright almost Im into the ground was found in situ and retrieved (Fig. 123). Its distinctive feature is a slightly raised band decorated with metopes and triglyphs (Fig. 124). The metopes contain double incised St Andrew's crosses and impressed circles. The triglyphs consist of a vertical row of impressed circles flanked on either side by five incised lines. Although this has to be confirmed by further excavation, it is very likely that the pithos came from a building of domestic use which stood originally on land. Our pithos resembles pithos fragments from Olynthos, found in a house of the 2nd quarter of the 4th Ct. Similar examples have been published from Thasos, described as A, and from the Athenian agora dated to the 6th Ct BC. More importantly for us, many fragments of a pithos with a similarly decorated raised band were found at Torone in 1982, on promontory 2, in a deposit with the richest concentration of A material thus far excavated on the site. A fragment with similar decoration was also found in 1989 in one of the trenches excavated on the Lekythos in a predominantly A pit. All these examples show that the use of this type of pithos in Greece lasted from the A period down to at least LC times. The rise of sea level in the harbour of Torone may have partly happened at any time during this time span. If a domestic dwelling stood on land near the present shoreline in the A and/or perhaps also in the C period, Thucydides' narrow isthmus in the last quarter of the 5th Ct may have been wider than today's neck, which has a width of 30m. A further indication that that area was originally above sea level and became submerged subsequently is suggested by the uncovering of a four-walled structure lying in less than 0.5m of water at a distance of I m from the present shoreline; it too</page><page sequence="82">82 DAVID BLACKMAN 4Seagrass K E Y '. 444 4 74 A?1tR I ~ * +44 4444 -Tr4Trl4)44 AREA 1 4 V, +4. .

The interior floor and walls of the structure were sealed with cement-like plaster. Analysis of the sealing agent must follow, but the appearance of a building like this suggests that the rise of sea level may have occurred at different stages, some of which may have been post/late antiquity. Although it is impossible for us to be chronologically more precise at this stage, we may be reasonably confident that the shoreline along the E side of the Lekythos and its isthmus lay farther E than the present one and that the Torone harbour in antiquity was a little smaller than it is today. The underwater contour mapping of the Lekythos suggests that a change of less than 2m in relative sea level would increase significantly the width of the present isthmus. Our findings in the submerged area immediately E of the Lekythos suggest that this was once a terrestrial area; they also suggest that the submersion occurred in stages. In due course Torone may shed valuable light on the coastal processes and coastal changes of Chalkidike. The increase of relative sea level suggested by our under- water investigation is approximately 1.75m. At present we have no confident explanation about the cause of these changes at Torone. But one should not forget that in the Aegean vulcan- ism and seismic activity predominate. Earthquakes are frequent. Within the range of evidence for such phenomena provided by other Mediterranean sites the rise of the relative sea level at Torone is by no means extreme." Nome of Pieria Dion. Three summaries of a decade's work at this site appear in AEMTH 10, 205-32. Prof. D. Pandermalis gives as highlights the location of the sanctuary of Zeus, confirmed by the discovery of an epistle from Antigonas Gonatos; the identification of the original 4th-Ct BC fortification circuit, including a previously unknown gate, and of the original agora of the same period; the discovery of the water-organ; and the completion of the excavation of the whole Dionysos villa, illustrated by an isometric reconstruction. T. Stefanidou- Tiveriou provides the historical background to the changes in the fortifications from Cassander to Theodosius I. S. Pingiat- oglou summarizes the results in the sanctuary of Demeter, founded late 6th/early 5th Cts BC and in continuous use until at least the 3rd-4th Cts AD; the sanctuary is now open to the public. Kitros: Alykes. The 1992 excavation in the S cemetery of Pydna (Chrysochoides plot) reported in ADelt 387-8, has been covered in AR 1996-97, 72-3, based on AEMTH 6. In AEMTH 10, 233-8, M. Besios summarises a decade of rescue excavation in the extensive cemeteries of anc. Pydna. These occupied an area in excess of 200 stremmata, and would have included more than 30,000 tombs. Approximately 2,200 have been investigated so far, dating LBA-ECh. Most of these contained burials of the upper and middle classes, and an unusual number were preserved intact, e.g. in the rich Chrysochoides plot (see AR 1996-97, 72-3) only three tombs of a total of 46 were robbed. The graves are used to trace population fluctuations, often linked to historical events, and the road systems which operated in the area, in some cases from PR times to the present. Louloudia. The 1992 rescue excavation here was noted in AR 1996-97, 72 and a report in ADelt 388, adds that an EIA grave and an extensive ECh cemetery were also found. Excavations here since 1993 revealed a fortified Episcopal complex with four towers, the site of the Bishop of Pydna's residence after the Goth attack on his see in 479.

Evidence of fire is clearly visible here, as in the rest of this important site. After the destruction, however, a small church was built NE of the bathhouse. 13th-Ct burials were uncovered around the church, dating from before its destruction by the flooding of the adjacent stream. At a later date, a Byz pottery workshop appears to have occupied the site. The S wall of the chapel contained a CT in which wall-painting fragments and a coin of Manuel Komnenos Doukas (1230-37) were found. (ADelt 442-3) A survey of the investigations into Byz and ECh trenches at Pydna is reported in AEMTH 10, 239-58. The Justinianic castle was re-fortified by the Bulgarians in the 10th Ct. The apses of a 4th-and 6th-Ct basilica came to light within the older walls, along with the late 10th/early 11lth-Ct Episcopal church. The settlement outside the walls included an inn, bath house, and pottery and implement workshops. WESTERN MACEDONIA Agia Anna (17km SW of Kastoria). An inscribed funerary stele topped by a palmette was found S of the Tsouka acropolis and is now in the archaeological collection at Nestorio (20km SW of Kastoria). The head of a maenad, probably once attached to a bronze vessel, was found in the Ypsomata locality. (ADelt 460) Agios Charalambos-Tetralophos (17km NE of Kozani, immediately N of the road from Veroia to Kozani). Finds from the area between these two villages from 1912 onwards suggest an extensive archaeological site. In 1992 part of a sculptured marble stele depicting a funeral feast was found. It is now known that fragments of a R marble statue came from the same area in the early 1960s, as did a column base in 1982 and a sculptured funerary stele in 1983. The 1912 find was a statue base with part of an inscription in Greek. (ADelt 456-7) Agrosykia (9km NE of Giannitsa). A R sculptured marble palmette akroterion and part of a rectangular marble block with a LR funerary inscription in Latin were handed in. (ADelt 458) Aiane (20km S of Kozane). In AEMTH 10, 23-40, G. Karami- trou-Mentesidi reviews the work (1983-1997) at this important Upper Macedonian site, where finds range from N to R. The rich A and C remains in particular have upset formerly- accepted views about the cultural and social isolation of Upper Macedonia. Results of the main excavation seasons (1983- 1990) at the settlement, Megali Rachi, and the chief cemetery, Leivadia, plus smaller sites in the wider area, have been covered in AR from 1986 onwards (see Site Index in AR 1996- 97). The article also details the enormous amount of work required after such a large and successful excavation-the establishment and staffing of a conservation laboratory, the foundation of a new museum in 1992, the creation of displays, and the preparation of the site itself for visitors. Despite great setbacks caused by the major earthquake in May 1995, and on- going rescue excavations over a wide area, it was hoped the museum would be opened in 1997. In 1992, limited funding confined work to investigation of the cemetery stratification in preparation for opening the area to the public. Between the built chamber tombs, two HL graves were discovered. In the W part of the cemetery was found an iron tripod accompanied by a bronze lebes, bronze oinochoe and bronze bowl with unusual handles with attachments in the form of hands (Fig. 126). Many figurine fragments found in these levels included kouroi and early examples of female forms wearing the polos headdress. (ADelt 445) The great interest taken by the people of Aiane in the archaeology and history of their area is demonstrated by the large numbers of chance finds they donate each year to the Archaeological Service. Amongst these in 1992 were a Cor aryballos with a procession of five warriors, two undecorated R oinochoai, a fusiform unguentarium, a large collection of sherds with relief plant decoration plus some with scenes, part of an R sculptured stele depicting Zeus Hypsistos, a fragmen- tary marble head, parts of two marble funerary steles, loom- weights, stone tools, spear-heads of bronze and iron, bronze fibulae and other jewellery of the IA, and many coins, includ- ing those of Cassander and Diocletian, and with a Janus head. (ADelt 455) Ambelies (5km NW of Giannitsa). At this LN settlement, 450 anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines were recovered from surface levels. (AEMTH 10, 165) Ano Kome (7km N of Aiane). A few sherds and a pyxis, small bowl and 'salt-cellar' of HL date, of unknown provenance but probably from a destroyed tomb, were handed in. From the Magoula locality came three stone tools and two clay loom- weights. A bronze R coin was found near the church of Agios Christophoros, and two HL coins from the Kampos locality. Part of a bronze bracelet and two R coins were found in the Katsalea locality. Illegal ditch-digging in the archaeological zone of Prophetes Elias, just E of the hill with the church of that name, cut through many antiquities, including slab-covered cist-tombs (in which no finds remained) and sections of ancient walls and drains. BA, IA and HL sherds were collected. (ADelt 455-6) Apidea, Tsotili. Special funding from the Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace allowed excavation to begin at a site known as Boufari. A large building (ca 25 xl Im, external walls ca 0.90m wide) was uncovered, divided into two sections by an internal wall. Each section was entered by a doorway 4m wide. One of these had three steps made of reused blocks. A test at the NE comrner of the building showed three destruction levels, dating 4th Ct BC-LHLER. Above and below a large marble slab in the latest destruction level was a group of interesting finds, including a bronze statuette of Heracles (Fig. 127), part of a marble statuette of a woman with three apples</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 85 in her left hand, and two moulds for figurines. Late (LByz?) burials were found above the latest destruction level. It is suggested that the two sections of the building might represent two separate dwellings in a planned, organized settlement. (ADelt 445-6) Apsalos (10km N of Edessa). Toumba Hill has signs of an important C-EByz settlement. (ADelt 459) Aravessos (1Ikm NW of Giannitsa). Part of the wing of a small marble LR eagle was found by the archaeologist I. Papangelos in the area NW of the acropolis of anc. Kyrros. Other eagles have been found in the vicinity, plus an inscrip- tion attributed to the worship of Zeus Hypsistos. (ADelt 458) Archontiko (between Pella and Giannitsa). In AEMTH 10, 143-155, A. Papaefthymiou-Papanthimou and A. Pilali-Papa- steriou combine results from two PR sites they have excavated in the Giannitsa vicinity, Mandalo (q.v.) and Archontiko, to illustrate the archaeological sequence in the area. Mandalo's EBA C14 dates are 2,900-2,200 BC, while those of Archontiko begin at ca 2,200 BC and continue to ca 1,600 BC. Many of the results at the latter site have been covered in AR 1996-97, 74-75 (see also Site Index). One new discovery was that of an oven with a pot still inside it, apparently containing food being cooked (contents not yet analysed). ADelt 449-50 has a short account of the 1992 season, covered in AR 1996-97, 74-5, from reports in AEMTH 7. Antiquities handed in from the district included a LN clay figurine head, three bronze coins and part of a marble monu- ment in secondary use which bore a fragmentary votive inscription. It had been dedicated by L. Calpurnius Gaianus. (ADelt 458) Arnissa (N shore of Lake Vergoritida). Unknown vandals destroyed a pillar with its capital still in place, which had appeared in 1985 when lake levels were lowered. In the Drenovo locality S of the settlement, where an IA cemetery is situated, a R building with hypocaust bricks was noted. (ADelt 458-9) Asproula (13km S of Argos Orestikon). A fragment of a triangular bronze fibula and a G solid bronze horse on an ellipsoidal base, from which hung two out of an original three solid miniature hydriae, were confiscated by the police here. The finder could not be persuaded to indicate their exact place of origin. (ADelt 457) Axos (5km W of Giannitsa). Tests uncovered three successive EN building phases on the PR mound known as Axos A. The earliest phase may be earlier than Giannitsa B and Nea Nikomedeia. As well as pottery, finds included stone and bone tools, a figurine head, clay sling bullets, spools, spindle-whorls, mat impressions on the bases of storage jars, nail-shaped clay objects, stone 'ear-plugs' and a possible bone flute, which if correctly identified, may be Greece's oldest musical instrument. Food remains included seeds, fishbones and shells. A new-born infant was buried in a pot under a house floor of the latest EN phase. (Pav. Chrysostomou, AEMTH 10, 162-4, 171-2) Chryse (17km NNE of Edessa). A HL-R settlement is located at Servika, SW of the village. Coins previously found here are in the archaeological collection at Edessa. (ADelt 459) Fig. 127 Drosia (15km W of Edessa). A report on the N settlement here has been covered in AR 1996-97, 75, based on AEMTH 6. 500m NE of the settlement was a half-destroyed tumulus, diameter greater than 5.80m and height ca Im. Within the mound was a circular ring of stones, diam. 4.80m, and within this, laid on the anc. ground level, were three burials, the first fragmentary, the second an adult in a contracted position and the third a child. In three places there were signs of fire. The only finds were a few sherds from a handmade pot, and the burials were undatable. (ADelt 451) Edessa: upper city/acropolis. Part of the city's LR cemetery was uncovered in a plot on the corner of Hero6n Polytechneiou and Pythagoras Sts. It contained four rock-cut cists, one with a tile cover, and a tile grave. The graves had single or double burials, and the only find was a small bronze bell-like pendant. (ADelt 450). Lower city: N cemetery. A brief account of the 1992 season appears in ADelt 450. This has been covered in AR 1996-97, 75, based on AEMTH 6. In AEMTH 10, 173-187, A. Chrysostomou collates informa- tion from recent and earlier rescue excavations to give a summary of what is known of pre-Ch Edessa: the city walls of both the lower city and a triangular acropolis on the cliffs above (founded in the EHL period and constantly repaired in succeeding phases); the roads leading to the city as defined by the numerous cemeteries; and the stratigraphy, which shows LBA-IA settlement both within the acropolis area and in the lower city and cemeteries.

Those which have been excavated or tested are Giannitsa B q.v. (ongoing from 1989 in many building plots), Agrosykia A (1984), Damianos (1990), Ambelies q.v. (1991), and Axos A, q.v. (1996). Sites with EN remains are Giannitsa B, and Axos A; surface sherds of the period were found at Asvestario A, possibly Archontiko q.v., Axos B and Drosero. Giannitsa B is the only site with MN material from excavation; a few surface sherds were collected at Archontiko. In the LN period most EN sites were resettled, and fifteen other sites, including Ambelies, Agrosykia A and Damianos, were also occupied. Giannitsa B and Agrosykia A also had FN phases. Only Giannitsa B, Archontiko and Axos A had long-term post-N habitation. Giannitsa B (AR 1996-97, 75 and refs.). Deep soundings in Ch. Stachtares' plot, situated in the old market area of the town, and above the S part of the PR mound, reached EN and LN levels, which produced a variety of pottery, local and imported, stone and bone tools, spindle-whorls, fragments of figurines, bones and shells. Much LByz glazed, decorated and plain pottery and three LByz ceramic kilns were in the upper strata. (ADelt 449) EIA finds from the 1972 excavation in the Kteniatreion locality, S of Giannitsa, were transferred from Thessalonike Museum to Pella Museum. (ADelt 458) Karyochori-Spelia (8-10km E of Ptolemaida). A number of new sites were located in the area of these two villages, thanks to the efforts of the conservator D. Penoglides and a resident of Karyochori, S. Kosmides, who acts as volunteer guard for the district's antiquities, and has been honoured by the Athens Academy for his work in this field. After levelling and the creation of a new road NNW of Karyochori, walls and stone blocks became visible, tiles were present, and sherds indicated a HL date. Sherds from hand- made pots and bones from destroyed tombs were also found. W of this, in the field of E. Pourloukakes, was the site of a R shrine, as witnessed by architectural members apparent after levelling operations. Amongst these was a votive stele with a sculpted pair of ears and the inscription: [K]XauSta ' H6va / ['A]prtgtSt / Ao ta (Fig. 128). On a foothill of the Vermion range, NE of Karyochori, was an acropolis ringed with fortifications, in some places pre- served to a height of 2m, and in other places built in dry-stone technique. In the S was a rectangular tower. There was virtually no deposit within the fortifications, but the building style suggested a HL date. In the same direction, on the smoother slopes of Vermion, constructions of tumulus type were visible. Some had a basis of schist slabs and others a covering of unworked stones. They may be LBA or EIA funerary mounds like those previously located on Vermion and in the grazing lands of the villages of Tetralophos, Kissas and Kapnochori. From the Ekklesaki locality near Spelia village, S. Kos- mides collected and handed in the lower part of a votive sculpture with eagle's feet and the letter N preserved; 127 bronze and 2 silver HL and R coins; 133 bronze, 4 lead and one silver coin of Byz date; a bronze seal; 5 arched bronze fibulae, 13 bronze rings, 10 bronze bracelets, and many bits of sheet from bronze vessels. In 1986 a Macedonian tomb was located SW of the anc. settlement here. (ADelt 457-8) Ktenio (ca 2km W of Aiane). During surface exploration of the archaeological area known as Kastro, HL and R sherds and glass fragments were found. On the two hills of Vourinos were remains of a fortified settlement, including some buildings with vaulted ceilings. Its occupation was probably HL-Byz. Two undecorated R oinochoai and 18 poorly preserved (?R) coins were handed in from the area. (ADelt 456) Kypsele (ca 15km NE of Vergina). Limited excavation near the HL buildings found in previous seasons produced only HL sherds. (ADelt 451). A collection of C-Byz coins was handed in to Veroia museum. (ADelt 460) Loutraki (21km NNW of Edessa). The archaeological collec- tion of this community was formally recognized by the Ministry of Culture. The collection included palaeontological remains, PR stone tools, an IA bronze sword, a bronze arched fibula, lead sling bullets, iron arrow heads and a spearhead, iron tools, bronze Byz objects, and fragmentary PR, HL and Ott pottery; its 37 coins are HL, R, Byz and Ott. (ADelt 459-60)</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 87 Mandalo (19km WNW of Giannitsa). In AEMTH 10, 143-58, A. Papaefthymiou-Papanthimou and A. Pilali-Papasteriou provide additional information on this small mound, excavated in 1981-88. Nineteen Cl4 samples tested confirmed that the two main phases of occupation were Final N (4,600-4,000 BC) and EBA (2,900-2,200 BC) with a ca 1000 year gap in occupation. Houses in both phases had walls of posts and packed clay and floors of whitish plaster and clay; hearths were often found, some with a sub-structure of large sherds. Two stone periboloi, built at the end of the FN period, and possibly still partly visible in the EBA, suggested organized community effort, but otherwise remained enigmatic. As well as good pottery sequences for both phases, the site produced numbers of spindle-whorls and loomweights, clay figurines and bone and stone tools. Amongst the latter were obsidian blades, of which nine FN and 1 EBA were of 'Carpathian' obsidian, a first occurrence in Macedonia. In the EBA, Melian obsidian was also present. Copper was already being worked in the FN here, as proved by various copper objects and a clay crucible (4,200- 4,000 BC). Mesemeri (1km W of Edessa). Two R clay unguentaria were handed in. (ADelt 459) Anc. Mieza (between Lefkadia, Kopanos and Naoussa). Reports on the 1992 seasons in the stoa, theatre, and a large HL building in the Kavalares field have been covered in AR 1996-97, 76-7, based on AEMTH 6 and other sources. A large, well-constructed cist tomb with five cover slabs was found ca 200m W of the tomb of Lyson and Kallikles, during excavation for a new district irrigation system. It had been robbed in antiquity, but sherds from two rf pelikes of the 3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC were found immediately outside it. During the same irrigation works a rock-cut vaulted chamber tomb was discovered in the Roudina locality near Kopanos. It had a faqade with a pediment and a frieze with triglyphs and metopes. The tomb contained ten burials. The grave goods were chiefly vases (unguentaria, pyxides, amphorae and lamps of the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC). Strigils, scissors, three poorly preserved coins, two gold coins (danakes) and a gold ear-ring were also found. (ADelt 452-4) Monasteraki (15km NNW of Edessa). S. Eleutheriades drew the attention of the Archaeological Service to two cist tombs in a previously-unknown site in the Tsanaktsi locality and handed in a two-handled pot, a bulbous unguentarium, a glass unguentarium and other finds from them. He also presented a clay oinochoe and an iron spear from the HL cemetery in the Apagorevmene locality, and a clay pot and BA sherds with channelled decoration from the main street of the village. (ADelt 459) Nea Pella. Part of a sculpted LR stele was handed in. (ADelt 458) Nea Zoe: Terikleia Hill (ca 8km NE of Edessa). BA and some HL sherds were noted over a wide area (ADelt 459). The ensuing excavation was covered in AR 1996-97, 77, based on AEMTH 7. Pella: canal area. In AEMTH 10, 93-104, M. Lilibaki-Akamati surveys work in the area of the modern irrigation canal (SW of the museum) over the last ten years, and also refers to earlier excavation in the area. Four building complexes on parts of four adjacent insulae are likely to have been connected with the cult of the healing god, Darron. These are: the sanctuary proper; the large circular area with three small tholoi set near its perimeter, in the insula immediately to the S of the sanctu- ary; the 'restaurant' E of this and SE of the sanctuary (for its mosaic floor, see AR 1984-5, 44; 1985-86, 62); and N of this and E of the sanctuary, the recently-excavated 'building of the treasure'. This consists of two parts, each having an open space surrounded by workshops. Its connection with the cult is suggested by a group of figurines found within an apse built of reused material, and the 'treasure' itself. This contained silver coins and gold jewellery, amongst which was a gold ring depicting the Mother of the Gods seated on a throne, a representation rarely found on jewellery. The sanctuary and the circular buildings (also likely to have been directly connected with the cult), were accessible on their W sides from a monumental avenue connecting the harbour with the city centre. The 'building of the treasure' and the 'restaurant' to their E probably provided subsidiary services connected with religious celebrations. All had large open spaces and abundant supplies of water. The sanctuary had three phases, of which the earliest was end 4th/early 3rd Ct BC and the latest LHL. Palace. P. Chrysostomou gives a summary of what is known so far about this huge complex, where a fourth cycle of excavations began in 1994, in AEMTH 10, 105-142, The article is accompanied by a new ground plan and many photographs. The central part of the palace consisted of four interconnected buildings (I, II, IV, V), each with a large central peristyle court. A monumental colonnaded facade with an off-centre propylon, looking S over the city, linked buildings I (to the E) and II, which served political, administrative, public and probably religious purposes. N of building I, building IV, which included a variety of chambers, halls, and baths, may have served as accommodation for the royal family and important officers, and finds suggest the mint may also have been located here. Building V, to the N of building II, is interpreted as the palaestra, and various parts of it are provisionally identified. To the W of buildings V and II, construction of another large stoa was begun early in the 3rd Ct BC, but never completed. The area was back-filled, and the smaller building III erected here, probably in the reign of Antigonas Gonatas. It may have housed workshops and provided accommodation for technicians and others employed by the royal household. Building VI, the 'small bath' some distance N of building III, may have served the needs of the same personnel. Although only a very small part of another large building, building VII, W of building III, had been uncovered in tests, four lead weights and quantities of storage pottery suggest this area was used for provisions and work- shops. Part of the city wall has been identified immediately N of the palace. The early phase of buildings I and II can probably be assigned to the 3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC. Extensions and alterations took place particularly from the time of Antigonas Gonatas and succeeding kings. The palace was sacked and stripped by L. Aemilius Paullus in 168 BC, after which it ceased to be the seat of royal power. It may have continued to be used for administrative and other purposes until the beginning of the I st century BC, after which the ruins were merely a rich source of building material. The 1992 excavation season continued work N of the great propylon between peristyle courts I and II, concentrating on the semi-circular wall. Before the semi-circular wall was con- structed, the area N of the propylon seems to have been divided into four or five successive halls, of which the two most northerly went out of use when the semi-circular wall was built. The excavation produced a rich collection of architectural</page><page sequence="88">88 DAVID BLACKMAN members, apparently left behind during stone-robbing in post- Byz times. (ADelt 447-9) Cemetery. The 1992 excavations are reported in ADelt 447; results were covered in AR 1996-97, 78, based on AEMTH 6. Pentaplatanos (lkm N of Giannitsa). The roof of an under- ground rock-cut chamber tomb collapsed during cultivation, and its contents were disturbed by the field's owner D. loannides, who gave a collection of HL objects from it to the Archaeological Service. Ensuing excavation showed that the tomb was approached by a narrow sloping dromos, and had funerary couches in the ante-chamber and on three sides of the chamber. Grave goods included vases, lamps, figurines and two bronze coins of Philip II and Cassander. The estimated period of use of the tomb was 3rd-2nd Cts BC. (ADelt 449) Petres (4km N of Amyntaio). In AEMTH 10, 1-22, P. Adam- Veleni gives a summary of 12 years' excavations at this small hill-top HL city, on the W shore of Lake Petro. Parts of its city wall have been located, and it is estimated that it may have had ca 5,000 inhabitants. A fine restoration drawing of the city by G. Velenis illustrates the article. Excavation concentrated on three areas: the S platform (nearest the site entrance and on the same level); the fountain sector, on the same level as the former, but further round on the SW slopes; and the summit of the hill, or acropolis sector. The S platform contained mainly private housing. As well as housing, the fountain sector had public buildings such as the sanctuary of Zeus, and community storehouses and processing areas. The earliest use of the acropolis was for storage pits, followed by housing arranged in the usual insulae, probably of the early 3rd Ct BC. The area was re-organized, and more luxurious dwellings erected in the 2nd Ct BC, when the city was at the height of its prosperity, owing to the proximity of the Via Egnatia. The city, which may have been founded in the second half of the 4th Ct BC, was destroyed during the Roman civil wars of the 1st Ct BC. This small HL city is valuable for the wealth of detail available on its city planning, the domestic organisation of its individual dwellings, and its industries. Details of these and other finds have appeared in previous editions of AR-see AR 1996-97, 78, and Site Index. A booklet on this important HL settlement in anc. Eordaia has been published by the excavator, P. Adam-Veleni: Hetpe;g hoptvag (Thessalonike 1998). Pontokome (12km N of Kozani).

(ADelt 458) Sebastiana (7km SE of Edessa). A R female statue head of the time of Trajan was found in the Krasta locality. On the Kanoni hilltop a large horseshoe-shaped enclosure with a drystone wall 2m wide probably served as a lookout post over the roads from Edessa to Pella and Edessa to Veroia. (ADelt 459) Servia.

By 1997 the plan shows the HL stage of the rectangular building (still being excavated) as a intricate complex of chambers ranged round a central court. Many rooms were too ploughed away for their functions to be interpreted. A room to the NE of the excavated area and two connecting chambers in its SW were better preserved. The NE room was approached by a narrow paved passage, then entered by steps down into its semi-subterranean interior. It had a bench built the length of the wall beside the entrance, and many loom-weights of different types (votive offerings?) in its SW comer. Along the W wall was found a rich series of clay sculptures and figurines of the goddess herself, and associated deities with chthonic connections, such as Demeter and Kore, Bacchus and Sarapis. In the centre of the room, near a hearth, lay a pair of iron keys with bone handles, and not far from them, part of a gilded bronze lock, possibly from a wooden chest. A small adjoining room contained valuable objects, such as fragments of bronze vessels. The two SW chambers each had a central hearth. Near the threshold leading from N, smaller, room to the larger, was a sacred pit-altar, in which were found a sculptured clay head of the goddess, representa- tions of Cybele with all her attributes, figurines of bulls, clay altars, and small vases. The larger, southern chamber had a clay pipe sunk in its NE corner to receive libations. Round it were sacred vessels, and clay figurines of bulls and snakes. The final destruction by fire was much in evidence in this chamber. The article contains a useful summary of what is known about this essentially mystery cult in the Near East and Greece and the many forms of this ancient deity. Shrine of Eukleia (AR 1990-91, 56; 1991-92, 49; 1993-94, 58; 1996-97, 79; and refs). In AEMTH 10, 55-67, C. Saats- oglou-Paliadeli concentrates on the original, 4th-Ct BC stage of the shrine. The article is enhanced by ground plans, and reconstructed cross-section, elevation and isometric drawing of the complex by N. Haddad. To this stage belong the larger temple with its attached S stoa; the large altar to the E of the temple entrance; the three statue bases in a line S from the altar; and, on a lower platform to the W of the temple, the large peristyle building. The site's well-known statues were probably still in situ at this period, and were apparently buried in the pits where they were discovered in the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC, after a major destruction likely to be connected with the R presence in Macedonia. The dedication to Eukleia, a deity associated with market places, indicates that the complex was in the agora of the city; and the discovery of a total of three bases dedicated by Eurydice, wife of Amyntas III, mother of Philip II, in the wider archaeological area, provides additional proof that the city was the old capital of the Macedonians, Aigai. Acropolis (AR 1988-89, 8; 1991-92, 49; 1996-97, 79). P. Faklaris summarizes the investigation of the walls and acropolis of Vergina, which began in 1980, in AEMTH 10, 69- 78. The walls have been traced on the E, W and S sides of the city, but the N side has yet to be found. They were built in the late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC, in the reign of Cassander. The acropolis was destroyed ca mid 2nd Ct. BC, after which the site was used as a small-scale manufacturing centre. Many different categories of finds are illustrated. The acropolis was abandoned during the 1st Ct BC. Cemeteries. In AEMTH 10, 79-92, A.

One hundred of them were discovered in 1996. The article takes into account horizontal stratigraphy, tomb types, burial customs and grave goods, and provides valuable information about many aspects of life in this clearly stratified society. Reports (ADelt 451-2) on the tombs found during the construction of the building over the Great Tumulus and on a two-phased LHL building with plaster floors on a hilltop ca 2km SW of the palace have been covered in AR 1996-97, 79, based on articles in AEMTH 6. Museum. On the move of the finds to Vergina Museum see the Introduction. Veroia. The lower part of a marble statue of a youth, the upper part of a funerary stele with a male and a female form discern- ible and part of an inscribed marble stele were handed in to the authorities. (ADelt 460) EASTERN MACEDONIA Amphipolis. The excavation of a road with an inbuilt drain, within the E fortification wall near the museum, was continued. The road served a building complex of the 4th Ct BC, the E part of which had already been excavated; the excavation was to continue (ADelt 468). A report on the tombs excavated in the E cemetery as a result of widening the road from Thessal- onike to Drama (ADelt 469-70) has been given in AR 1996-97, 80-1, based on AEMTH 6. Anc. Amphipolis. K. Lazaride (AS) continued conservation of the stones of the gymnasium, as well as study of the building for publication. (Ergon 1997, 63) Anc. Argilos. In AEMTH 10, 663-80, Z. Bonias and J. Perreault give a summary of five years' excavation by the Kavala Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities in association with the Canadian Archaeological Institute (University of Montreal). Much of the information has been covered in AR 1996-97, 81, based on AEMTH 7 and other sources. On the acropolis, surface cleaning showed that the early HL building founded over A remains was square, 14 x 14m, with traces of internal divisions. The exterior walls were Im wide and it was entered from a small paved court on its S side, through a door Im wide. Only part of the S fagade had been excavated; this was preserved to a height of 2.5m, and the exterior was heavily coated with undecorated white plaster. This massive, tower-like structure with its views over all the surrounding countryside and the sea may have been the seat of a member of the royal Macedonian retinue after Argilos had ceased to exist as a town. Below this structure, the acropolis had remains of several other building phases, the earliest being ca mid-6th Ct BC. Poros architectural fragments (parts of columns, architrave and cornice) of the late 5th/early 4th Ct BC, which retained vivid blue colouring on well-preserved fine plastered surfaces, were found in top-soil, but may indicate the existence of a public building, possibly of a religious character, in this part of the site. Additional trenches in the harbour sector, excavated because of roadworks to widen the national highway, located parts of anc. cobbled roads leading from the shore towards the acropolis, part of the city wall which was probably extant from the 6th Ct BC, and building remains dating 6th-mid 4th Cts BC. There was nothing later than the seizure of the city by Philip II, indicated by an extensive destruction level. ADelt 470-72 has an account of the first season at the site (1992). In a building plot at Kallithea, Nea Kerdyllia, E of the anc. city but within the wider area of its E cemetery, six burials were excavated, two in clay larnakes, two in tile graves, and two cremations in clay-lined pits. A notable find in one of the larnakes was a broken but restorable and virtually complete rf column krater in the severe style, with a horseman on one side and a spearman on the other. Along the S side of the tombs was a low stone heap composed of small stones and several bases from grave-markers. It had apparently been formed as a rough peribolos for the tombs after a destruction of the funerary monuments, possibly to be connected with the passage of Xerxes' army in 480 BC. All six tombs date to approximately this period. (ADelt 472-4) Dikili Tash. The report in AEMTH 10, 681-704, by C. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki, R. Treuil and D. Malamidou summar- izing the 1986-96 Greek-French investigation programme here includes an account of the geomorphological study of the site and environs, with a diagram, and a topographical map of the mound, showing the positions of earlier and on-going excava- tions. In the latter the French, in sector V, are concentrating on building remains of the beginning of the LN period (Dikili Tash I = Sitagroi II), while the Greek team, in sector VI, are uncovering houses of the end of the LN period or Chalcolithic period (Dikili Tash II) for which there are radiochronological dates of 4,320-4,043 BC, and which may be equated with Sitagroi IIIc. It is of interest that in both periods and in both sectors, buildings were on a NW-SE axis with small passages or alleys between them. The extraordinary bull's skull complete with horns covered with unfired clay modelled to restore a life- like appearance, which was found in sector V in 1995, is illustrated in AEMTH 10, 701. Other details of the discoveries in each sector have been covered in AR 1986-87 onwards (see AR 1996-97, 81-2 and site index). Drama: Arkadikos. A brief report on the 1992 season at this PR site appears in ADelt 467. This has been covered in AR 1996-97, 82, based on AEMTH 6. Gazoros (21km ESE of Serres). A trial excavation took place on Agios Athanasios hill (probable site of anc. Gazoros) where a road cutting partly uncovered a pithos and a paved area. The pithos, set upright and preserved to a height of 1.38m, con- tained earth, small stones and remains of small vases, plain, bg and rg; there were no bones and it was probably for storage. Above and below the paved area were bg sherds, one from a reeded kantharos, and plain wares. Both the pithos and the paved area probably belonged to a building destroyed when the road was cut. (ADelt 474) Kale Vryse: Mikre Toumba (20km W of Drama). A report on the 1992 season at this sanctuary (of Dionysos?) attributes its savage destruction by fire early in the 3rd Ct BC to the invasion of the Gauls. (ADelt 467-8) Other details have been covered in AR 1996-97, 82, based on AEMTH 7. Mesorache (ca 18km N of Amphipolis). During road-widen- ing, three tombs were found on Agios Georgios hill. One was a chamber tomb cut into soft rock, with a cist tomb of stone slabs beside the left side of the chamber; it was robbed, but above it were found HL coins, bone objects, gold leaves from a banqueting wreath, undecorated sherds, the remains of an iron strigil and nails. The other two tombs were pit graves, one with a plain incomplete ribbed juglet and a hoard of 11 LR coins</page><page sequence="90">90 DAVID BLACKMAN (Diocletian, Probus, Constantine the Great), and the other largely destroyed by the mechanical excavator. (ADelt 474) Nea Petra: Tsifliki (24km ESE of Serres). In this locality, 3.5km S of the village, post-Byz pottery spanning several centuries was found scattered over a wide area after roadworks. (ADelt 479) Nea Zichne: Prophetes Elias. On the right side of the road leading to the church and about 50m from it, an irregular trench ca 60m wide was found filled with burnt remains, broken pottery and roof tiles, iron objects and many iron nails. The sherds were from LByz plain, glazed and a little incised pottery. Local tradition recalls a Byz monastery near the site of the present church. (ADelt 475) Toumba. Two cuttings in the soft rock on the W bank of the road from Nea Zichne to Myrine railway station, about 800m S of the Serres-Drama road and 120m SE of Toumba, were found and partly destroyed during road-widening in 1991. They had had circular floors (diam. 1.55 and 1.95m), vaulted ceilings, and preserved heights of 1.05 and 1.40m respectively. They were filled with earth, stones, a few animal bones and shells, and much pottery, mostly from thick-walled plain vessels and banded eastern Ionian wares, plus bg and a few rf sherds and Megarian bowl fragments. Obviously the cuttings had been used as rubbish pits, but the purpose for which they were originally made remains unknown. (ADelt 474-5) Neos Skopos (8km SE of Serres). Three inscriptions were handed in from the area of the anc. settlement here and are now in Serres museum. The first (fragmentary) was a LC list of names on Thasian marble. The second (fragmentary) had letters of the Parian alphabet of 5th-Ct BC type, but could not be interpreted. The third (almost complete) was a votive inscription to Zeus and King Philip; the dating of the letter forms indicates Philip V, whose worship is known from other sources. (ADelt 479 &amp; pl. 132o) Orphani: anc. Phagres (Kanoni Hill, NW of Orphani). M. Nicolai'dou-Patera summarizes the results of four short excava- tion seasons here in the last 12 years in AEMTH 10, 835-46. The very poor preservation of this city, where so far only one building and the foundation trenches of others have been found, may be due not only to constant ploughing but also to the very friable nature of its building stone (marl) for which a quarry has been identified. Numerous pits, some connected by channels, were dug in house floors, and from these came remains of amphoras and also smaller plain bg and bf vases, many of which could be restored. Amongst them were four Attic column kraters, two fragmentary and two almost com- plete. They were decorated with heroic themes and scenes of battle, plus one scene with Dionysos and other Olympian gods and another with a pair of lions rending a bull. The kraters date to 530-20 BC and come from known Athenian workshops. The finds generally were from the 2nd half of the 6th Ctlearly 5th Ct BC, when the city was destroyed. Herodotus records that Xerxes passed by Phagres, but it is not yet known whether he was the cause of the destruction. Tombs of the 5th-4th Ct BC discovered on the NE side of the hill in a rescue excavation in 1994 prove that the city con- tinued to exist. Cremation in two different forms was the usual rite. The dead were accompanied by rich grave goods: vases, figurines, weapons and gold and silver jewellery. In one grave was a copper coin with the letters QAFP on the obverse, confirming the ancient city's identification. Fig. 129 Paradeisos on the Nestos-anc. Topeiros. Remains of an anc. and Byz settlement at the site were excavated. The site was founded in the 1st Ct AD, destroyed and abandoned at the end of the 6th Ct after having been fortified by Justinian and reoccupied in the 10th until the 14th Ct. On a junction of the Via Egnatia and the Nestos river, it was of extreme strategic importance if limited in size. Excavations uncovered part of the water supply system, part of the fortification walls and some houses outside the walls. (ADelt 503) Pentapolis (13km ESE of Serres). During the construction of the new Serres-Drama road, seven rock-cut tombs were found in the Chania locality, 200m W of the old high school. The tombs were approximately circular in plan (diam. 1.20-2m). They had rectangular or square openings in the side, blocked with a stone. All had more than one burial and one tomb had seven. The skeletons lay in a row on their backs, oriented E-W with heads to the W. The only finds were undecorated pots of coarse clay with globular bodies and horizontally-set, pushed-up handles just below the rim, smoked or blackened by fire (Fig. 129). They follow a Thracian tradition which began in the IA and continued to the R period. The Pentapolis pots are prob- ably local and may be HL or R, but they are difficult to date. (ADelt 475-6) Petropigi (Kavala). E. Ostby (Norwegian Institute at Athens) reports on work in 1997: "The final excavation season at the Byz fortress at Petropigi, under the direction of Prof. Siri Sande from Oslo University, lasted for only two weeks in June 1997. The principal result was the identification of two successive Byz phases of the monument, both to be placed within the 12th-13th Cts AD: an initial phase with three gates in the external fortification wall, and a second one when one gate was transformed into a tower and other towers were built or enlarged next to the two remaining gates, which were strengthened by portcullis arrangements. The final additions to the complex, one roofed han built in the enclosed area and a second one, or perhaps just an open-air platform, connected with the N fortification wall and a set of fire-places built into it, are clearly of Ott date. Some remains of an earlier building, with a different orienta- tion, were discovered at a level immediately below the first Byz structures in the S part of the fortress; it may be either Byz or C, since some objects (mostly sherds) of 5th-4th Ct BC date may be associated with it. The txcavation has produced no material between the C and the MByz periods."</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 91 Philippoi. During 1987-96, M. Seve and P. Weber of the French School studied the E, W and S sides of the lower, S part of the R forum. The work was completed, and has been presented in the form of two models (which may later be on display at the Philippoi Museum) and a comprehensive guide, to be followed by a full final publication. Although the lower forum assumed its present layout in the reign of Claudius, so little remains that the theoretical reconstruction concentrates on the restoration in the time of Marcus Aurelius, the ruins of which, despite later additions, alterations and damage, are basically those visible today. The W side of the lower forum had a bouleuterion in the N (with a statue of Fortuna outside its S wall), a basilica, and the records office in the S. The S side had a row of 21 shops. The E side had a temple dedicated to the imperial cult in the N, a building with four rooms in a row in the centre, and the library to the S. The pairs of buildings which faced each other across the forum, the bouleut- erion and the temple in the N and the records office and the library in the S, though they differed in detail, had similarities in dimensions and overall design which gave architectural homogeneity to the forum; this was further enhanced by a 1f- shaped double colonnade round all three sides of the central open area. In the N, two monumental gates connected the S part of the forum with the N part, in the area now occupied by basilica A. The article includes very clear ground plans, elevations and cross-sections. (AEMTH 10, 705-17) LR/ECh houses and shops. In AEMTH 10, 719-33, G. Gounaris and G. Velenis summarise the results of the Thessalo- nike University excavations in 1988-1996. Work took place in the 4th and 5th insulae E of the forum, bounded by the Via Egnatia on the N and the Diagonal Road on the S, and in parts of two insulae S of these, on the S side of the Diagonal Road. The results in the 4th and 5th insulae were partly covered in AR 1996-97, 83; the 4th insula is presented in more detail here, with separate plans to illustrate each stage of its history, and an isometric reconstruction of the most impressive 4th-Ct AD villa which occupied the whole insula, and may even have had a small aviary or zoo next to its 12-couch banqueting hall. Finds in the two 5th-Ct AD houses into which it was converted showed that the inhabitants were Christians. In the 6th Ct AD large parts of these buildings were changed into workshop and storage areas, the latter for wine; this necessitated cutting pits into the mosaic floors. All these changes took place without any sign of a destruction. In the early 7th Ct AD, Philippoi suffered an earthquake, and the area was temporarily abandoned. Some time in the second half of the same century, the destruction debris was cleared and some of the stronger walls incorporated into two smaller two-storey independent dwellings on the W side of the insula, the rest of which remained open. A last building phase was in the 8th/9th Cts AD. The two insulae on the S side of the Diagonal Road had a colonnade on their north facades (reconstruction drawing) and contained shops and workshops. The E insula had also had a colonnade on its S side, but possibly in the 5th Ct AD this was incorpor- ated into the workshops. In the small sector of the W insula so far excavated was part of a mosaic depicting a horseman and chariot, probably early 4th-Ct AD, possibly from a public building or a rich private dwelling. Here a glass factory was founded, probably at the beginning of the 5th Ct AD, which remained in operation till the first half of the 7th Ct AD. Details of its workings are preserved. Also surveyed in AEMTH 10 (735-42) is the N group of buildings attached to the Museum Basilica. Consisting of a complex of buildings arranged on two levels, the remains have been identified as those of the Episcopal headquarters of Philippoi in the second half of the 6th Ct. A strong earthquake in the 7th Ct flattened the building, and worship was confined to the N building up till the 12th Ct. Promachonas-Topolnic'a. In AEMTH 10, 745-61, C. Koukouli- Chrysanthaki, H. Todorova, I. Aslanis, J. Bojadziev, F. Konstantinopoulou, I. Vajsov and M. Valla give a summary of the work of this joint Greek-Bulgarian project. The Bulgarian excavations took place in 1980-90, and the Greek investiga- tions, still continuing, began in 1992. The results are to be presented in a joint publication. The site is located on two adjoining flat-topped hills on the SE slopes of Mt Kerkine, close to the W bank of the Strymon. The Greek-Bulgarian border bisects the E hill, and the main excavations are here, on either side of pyramid 63 on the frontier line. The settlement was of the sparsely-inhabited open type and was occupied throughout the 5th millennium BC. Three phases have been recognized. The latest phase, phase I, had been ploughed away on both sides of the border, and its very scant remains are difficult to interpret; it is chiefly identified by pottery. In phase II, the Bulgarians located a building, 8 x 5m, with walls formed of thickly-set posts, filled in with branches or reeds and coated with clay, and a large, centrally-set, clay-covered post to support the roof. It contained an unusual oven with receptacles on either side of its opening; pots and a millstone lay nearby. Parts of four large sculptured female figures (ht. ca 40-50cms) had apparently formed part of the decoration of the W wall. In the E part of the Bulgarian excavations, two rows of very large post-holes, ca 1.10m apart, may have been either house walls or part of a settlement peribolos. The houses of the earliest phase, phase III, also had walls formed of posts, which were set in the stereo. The area within the walls was excavated to a depth of 0.60-0.70m below the surface of the natural soil, so that the rooms were semi- subterranean. Several different levels, probably for different purposes, were often left within a building; hearths and ovens set on some of these were kept in repair. The stereo was not excavated between the posts, but was left to form the lower part of the walls. Some of these buildings had upper floors or platforms, also with hearths. The latest, phase I, sherds include those with graphite decoration, black-on-red ware, and incised decoration, often with white filling. These suggest this phase is contemporary with Sitagroi III and Dikili Tash II in E Macedonia, and Gradeschni'a-Slatino IV and Mari'a I in W and central Bulgaria. In contrast with phase I, the pottery of phases III and II indicates unbroken cultural continuity. Decorated wares include the E Macedonian Akropotamos type with red bands on a pale unpainted surface (mostly local imitations, though some sherds are imported ware); polychrome decoration of red bands outlined in black on a light ground; and bitum decoration on a red polished surface. Bitum decoration is normally found in central and E Europe and this is its first occurrence in Greece. Also represented are rippled decoration on a black polished surface, and various types of simple incised decoration, often with remains of white filling, some of which have central European analogies. Anthromorphic vessels occur. Examples of all these types are illustrated, as are vessels in plain wares. The details which may distinguish the pottery of phases II and III are still being studied; a provisional conclusion is that these phases are contemporary with Sitagroi II, Dikili Tash I and Demetra I in E Macedonia; Arapi in Thessaly; the Kurilo phase</page><page sequence="92">92 DAVID BLACKMAN Grand Autel Sud-Est Portique Coud6 SPassge Galerie lonique aux piliers SIle b abside etP.

The impor- tance of the Strymon as a connecting link between the Aegean coast, the Balkan hinterland and Central Europe is evident. Other finds include anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figu- rines, miniature pots, blades of flint, quartz and rock crystal, stone picks and chisels, pounder/grinders, bone tools, spindle- whorls (often with incised decoration), clay loom-weights, waisted stone 'weights' and jewellery. Jewellery fashioned from Spondylus shells, however, has been rarely found so far. The beginning of the Greek contribution to this joint Greek- Bulgarian project is reported in ADelt 468. This has been covered in AR 1996-97, 83, based on AEMTH 6. Rodolivos: Agios Athanasios (15km NE of Amphipolis). A fortification circuit with two possible circular towers and some building remains within it was discovered 500m SE of the known rock-cut tombs on a lower level, and 250m from the chapel of Agios Athanasios. It may have been a LR fort. (ADelt 479) Serres. Part of the acropolis of the town around the Orestes tower was investigated in order to discover whether a phase earlier than the Byz exists. Evidence for an earlier structure was uncovered, along with a phase of crude settlement follow- ing the capture of the fortress in 1383 by the Ottomans. (ADelt 515-17)</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 93 The Old Metropolis (Agioi Theodoroi) of the town was investigated prior to being rededicated. Two tombs were discovered in the N and S aisles near the altar. Under the 11 th- 12th Ct floor of the original basilica, the engainion was located in the form of a rectangular tomb divided into two sections by a reused marble closure panel. No evidence was found to verify the older theory that the church was built on the remains of a 6th-Ct basilica. (ADelt 517) Sphelinos (27km E of Serres). On a mountain height 2.5km N of this village a cemetery of cist and pit graves and small tumuli ringed by stones was discovered. It had suffered severely from illegal excavation, and there were no indications of its date. (ADelt 479) Strymon Delta. In AEMTH 10, 639-61, C. Koukouli-Chrysan- thaki, S. Samartzidou, A. Dunn, R. Catling, C. Tziavos and C. Anagnostou combine the results of excavation, survey, and geomorphological testing, and the information available from early maps, travellers' accounts and aerial photography to study the geomorphological development of the Strymon Delta and the effects that changes in it had on the development and distribution of settlement in the area, particularly as represented in antiquity and the Byz period by the successive cities of Eion, Amphipolis and Chrysopoulis. Excavations near the old National Highway linking the Thessalonike-Kavala road with that from Drama to Amphipolis uncovered the foundations of a MByz church built with large blocks and spolia from Amphipolis. Some 12m long and 8m wide, the structure was originally of the inscribed-cross variety with four piers instead of columns. It was domed and the diakonikon and prothesis were not divided from the sanctuary proper. Wall-painting fragments were found, chiefly of a non- figural decorative nature, from the lower courses of the walls. Figural fragments include depictions of the Virgin, the Cruci- fixion and the Pieth as well as other unidentified scenes. The wall-painting fragments and coin finds date the structure to the late 12th/early 13th Ct. A date of the l1th-12th Ct is thus hypothesised, with a destruction during the aftermath of the 4th Crusade. (ADelt 517-19) Thasos: anc. city. Excavation of the Papakyriakou plot was completed in 1992. An account of its HL peristyle house, roads and other remains appeared in AR 1996-97, 83-4, based on reports in AEMTH 6 and 7. A continuation of one of the roads in this plot was found in the Klonares plot to the E. Part of a 2nd-ist Ct BC house and a section of road were discovered in the Divanakes plot near the Silenus gate. Members of the French School studied the city walls in the area of the sanctu- ary of Athena and continued stratigraphic testing in areas NE of the agora (ADelt 480-2). This work has been covered in AR 1992-93, 61-2. Passage of the Theoroi (NE of the agora). In AEMTH 10, 813-23, Fr. Blond6, A Muller and D. Mulliez have combined the results of various stratigraphic tests in this area to present six stages preceding the passage as it stands today, the first five dating to the 6th Ct and the sixth to the early 5th Ct BC. By stage 2, a wall which could have been either a retaining wall or perhaps part of an A city wall ran across the later passage site, and by stage 3 part of this wall had been removed, forming a passage which was to remain with various changes though stages 4-6 until it assumed its present form in stage 7, probably a little before 480 BC. The passage of the Theoroi is thus a monumental form of an earlier axis of communication. Although it would be interesting to know whether the original opening was a gate in an A city wall, or only a passage uniting two areas within the city separated by a terrace wall, nothing could be proved either way. Much of this information was presented in AR 1994-95, 49-51, but the clear plans of each stage in AEMTH 10 are a valuable addition. Z. Bonias and J.-Y. Marc report on stratigraphical tests in the anc. theatre, prior to its restoration so that performances may to take place in it again (it has not been possible to use it since 1984). Tests were made in the cavea, orchestra, parodoi and the stage building. Those in the cavea showed that in the 2nd Ct AD, fill had been brought in both to provide for extra seating and to allow seats to be set at a steeper angle to give better sight-lines into the arena, which was ca 1.50m lower than the first seats and guarded by a stone barrier ca 2m high. Below the 2nd-Ct AD fill was that of the HL period dating ca end 4th Ct BC. Evidence was found for four building phases in the stage building, two R, one HL, and one as yet undatable but earlier than the HL stage wall. Before the theatre was built, at least part of the area had been occupied by A buildings, and after the theatre was abandoned, its site was used as an ECh cemetery. (AEMTH 10, 795-812; ADelt 461-5) The S approaches to the agora. Report on the French School's 1997 season of excavation: "The soundings of the 1996 season having confirmed the existence of a large public building between the SW side of the agora and the Court of the 100 Flagstones, we were able, this year, to carry out an open area excavation of the SE third of this ensemble. In this way we uncovered the complex of rooms on the SE side, two rooms on the SW side, the SE entrance and a considerable part of the courtyard which occupied the largest surface area in this complex. In fact it consists of a building arranged around a square courtyard of about 700 m2, surrounded by rooms on three sides. Two monumental entrances give access to this building: the Ionic passage on the agora side, and the Court of the 100 Flagstones on the other side (Fig. 130). This construction in its present state has clearly been restored several times. The most recent phase goes back to the 3rd Ct AD, but other alterations of the imperial period (Anton- ine?) are also visible. It is certain, however, that the first phase of construction goes back to the HL period, as is shown by the style of certain walls (uneven opus quadratum) as well as the stratigraphy. The whole area seems to have been abandoned after the first third of the 4th Ct AD: an interesting fact which could be connected with the end of the ancient city or with its transformation. The function of this complex cannot yet be established with certainty, but it is certainly a large civic building: prytaneion? symposion? palaestra? Unfortunately we have been able to discover no clue as to its function. On the other hand the quality of the furnishings indicates a prestigious place: a revetment of marble plaques on the walls, marble mosaic floors, etc. The last use, at any rate of the SW rooms, was as workshops. The finds consist above all of an abundant harvest of coins (197 in all) certain of which are of great interest, such as the double sestertius of Pergamon issued in the region of Caracalla on the occasion of the third renewal of his neokoria. Also, the identification of levels of the 3rd Ct AD provides contexts for a period which is still not well known at Thasos. A large quantity of Roman sigillata ware, Candarli and African pottery allows better dating of the movement from one centre of production to the other." The rampart.

The applied architectural decoration on the interior of the gateway (already published by R. Martin, Revue Archdologique 1968, 171-184) was executed at the same time as the tower built in front of the entrance way on the outside. The reliefs of Zeus and Hera which gave their name to the gate belong to the same programme commissioned by Pythippos, son of Paiestratos, towards the end of the 4th Ct BC. Certain proposed restorations of the architectural decora- tion, suggested by R. Martin, were at once amended or corrected; it is also certain that what was considered up to now a simple forecourt is in fact a real tower whose back wall, starting from the rampart walk, rested on the internal facing of the enceinte, which explains certain features of the blocks of the applied decoration. In 1998 research will be continued and deepened. The goal is to reconstruct, using the very numerous preserved blocks, what this original architectural complex looked like at the end of the 4th Ct BC (mixing aesthetic considerations with purely defensive concerns). This research forms part of the overall study of the walls of Thasos which the authors of this report have been carrying out for a decade." On the SE approaches to the theatre, Didier Viviers reports: " A study season was held in 1997. Our objective was the architectural study of the remains unearthed on the SE approaches to the theatre since 1992 as well as a careful examination of the pottery brought to light in the course of our four previous seasons. We were able to complete the graphic documentation and to study the architectural elements with a view to their interpreta- tion and eventual restoration. We were particularly interested in a number of architectural pieces reused in ECh burials which enabled us to put forward a proposal for the restoration of the massive structure, perpendicular to and in front of the rampart. We also studied the reinforcement of the inner side of the curtain wall and propose to interpret it as a solid flight of stairs leading up to the rampart walk, of which one step at least was reused in the theatre as a seat. These different reuses enabled us to confirm a destruction of the fortification wall of Thasos during the first half of the 3rd Ct AD. We also studied the absolute chronology of the remains by examination of the pottery. The material discovered in the fill resting against the wall seemed to provide a homogeneous date at the end of the 6th Ct/beginning of the 5th Ct BC, apart from a few sherds which seem to go back no further than the 2nd quarter of the 5th Ct BC. The date of the material which formed the fill against the foundations of the massive perpen- dicular structure and which is stratigraphically earlier than the fortification wall also goes back to the turn of the 6th and 5th Cts BC, but this fill could have followed a re-excavation of the area or a dismantling of certain remains." Cemeteries: C. Koukouli-Chrysanthi and M. Sgourou provide a comprehensive chronological and geographical summary of the cemeteries of the anc. city, largely found in rescue excavations, and A. Angelarakes gives an account of the examination of 65 of the skeletons. (AEMTH 10, 769-94) Anne Couli6 presents the results of her study of 3,000 bf sherds and the criteria for her identification of local Thasian bf pottery (AEMTH 10, 825-34). Thasos Island. In 1992, work to complete the 'Archaeological Map of Thasos' involved clearing the Med fortifications at Melissa-Palaiokastro and Limenas. The former site was discovered in 1990 and consists of a fortified settlement containing private dwellings and a cistern. The width of the walls is particularly impressive, standing at some 7.40-7.50m in places, although further investigation may indicate that this may in fact be a double wall. The remains of two towers were identified. (ADelt 510) Chioni (2.8km SE of Kato Prinos). After a cloudburst, part of a kiln with many broken amphoras within it was revealed in the side of a small stream. The stamps on some of the handles showed that they belonged to the oldest group of Thasian 4th- Ct BC amphoras. The kiln was not far from the country establishment and tower at Phiale, which were almost certainly connected with wine-making; the area had extensive vineyards until recently. A clay source was located a short distance from the amphora workshop, which is the farthest from the sea of those so far discovered. (ADelt 478-9) The excavation which followed was reported in AR 1995-96, 31-2. At Limenas, the acropolis of the Med fortification occupies the site of an anc. temple of Pythian Apollo. Remains include a small chapel, cisterns, towers and houses. The masonry included ancient spolia and dressed and rough stone blocks with little or no brick inclusions. The two Med towers to the W are built on ancient remains. (ADelt 510-12) Marmaromantra. After a six-year interval, excavation recommenced on the country building complex here. Work concentrated on the store-room, a rectangular building ca 17 x 14m. It had an entrance hall, three chambers of equal size and</page><page sequence="95">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 95 unknown use, and a large L-shaped area containing the lower parts of 11 large pithoi (Fig. 131), some of which would have been over 3m high when complete. Many had been mended in antiquity with lead clamps and must thus have been used for storing dry goods rather than liquid. The channelled lower stone of an oil press was also pres- ent, but other finds were compara- tively rare. The building could be dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC by coins and stamped tiles and amphora handles. (ADelt 465-6) Nymphaion. Less than 3km from anc. Thasos, high in the val- ley of Agia Marina, in a thickly- wooded area beside a dry stream bed, the vertical rock face carries more than ten votive inscriptions and a relief carving showing three upright female figures (Fig. 132). An attempt by antiquities thieves to remove the carving was fortunately unsuccessful. The spring which must have been the centre of worship here in antiquity is today represented by a cistern. (ADelt 477-8) r::: .... ... a~apt Fig. 132 Panagia: Saliare or Saliara. In this area on the bay of Ai- Gianne, unexcavated remains of a building complex and a tower were cleared and drawn. They may be connected with the anc. quarries in the area (ADelt 478). Phari. Francine Blond6 and J.Y. Perreault report on the work of the Franco-Hellenic team (Blonde, Perreault and K. Peristeri) in 1997: "A second study was carried out on the material from a potter's workshop of the A period excavated between 1985 and 1989. It should be remembered that the material remained inaccessible for a number of years for reasons beyond our control. The study seasons could not, therefore, begin before 1996. The 1997 season was devoted to the detailed study of several stratigraphic units and of the range of locally made shapes, as well as the search for joins. A third season, which we hope will be the last, is scheduled for the year 1998." Thasian territory. Michele Brunet and Gilles Sint's report on their 1997 fieldwork, carried out in collaboration with the 18th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Kavala: "A final season of verification on the ground was carried out in parallel with the editing of the monograph Le territoire insulaire thasien. We systematically visited all the sites referred to in our catalogue for the SW and S parts of the island, our chief purpose being to fix their exact position by means of a GPS (latitude, longitude and altitude); at the same time we completed our collection of samples of surface material (sherds and millstone fragments). At the Museum, all the pottery gathered in the course of the survey was inventoried, classified and stored with that of the previous seasons. The stone material was stored in the apotheke of the excavation house in order to facilitate its further study." Thasian millstones of volcanic stone. Michele Brunet, Arthur Muller and Gilles Sintes report: "In the framework of the French School Project on 'Crafts- man in ancient Greece', M. Brunet, A. Muller and G. Sinths began in 1997 a study of the 120 fragments of millstones collected during the survey of the Thasian chora. After cataloguing, about forty were drawn. Establishing the catalogue enabled us to do a typological classification of the millstones and a preliminary identification of the volcanic rocks used which needs to be confirmed by petrographic and chemical analysis of samples. Besides this, 37 complete or fragmentary millstones were found in the museum storerooms, which come from the excavations in the town of Thasos. A brief stay in Samothrace gave us the opportunity to recognise the different types of volcanic rock present on the island. As a result of this geological knowledge it seems that the millstones found on Thasos are not exclusively or even particularly from Samothrace. The study should be continued in 1998 in order to complete drawing the samples in the museum." Triada (24km W of Serres). During excavation of a ditch for a natural gas pipe, six R-LR tombs were found 1.5km E of this village in the Nosokomeia locality. One tomb was completely destroyed, one was a cist, two were pit-graves with stone covers and two were tile graves. Finds included a figurine of Eros riding a dove, lamps (one with Herakles wrestling with the lion on the disc), some bronze jewellery, and small plain vases. One of the pit graves had seven LR coins, and the destroyed tomb had a hoard of 46 bronze coins (Maximian, Diocletian, Probulus, Constantine I, Aurelian, Carinus, Florian- us, Claudius II and others unidentified). (ADelt 475) Verge (18km SW of Serres). Two R pit graves with stone covers were found during the excavation of an irrigation ditch in the Manousi locality, where the cemetery of anc. Verge is situated. The skeletons lay on their backs with their heads to the W. One tomb had two undecorated jugs; the other was without grave goods. (ADelt 476)</page><page sequence="96">96 DAVID BLACKMAN ::::,:: Fig. 133 Vranokastron (on Mt Pangaion). The Byz monastery complex at the foot of Mt Pangaion, identified as being that of Agios Georgios Diasorites mentioned in Patriarchal texts, is discussed in full in AEMTH 10, 847-57. The katholikon was a large three-aisle structure that underwent a number of phases from the 13th to the 18th Ct, and evidence (including a dated sun- dial) indicates that there may have been a phase as early as the 11th Ct. THRACE Abdera. Some of the 1992 rescue excavations here, such as the discovery during roadworks of a long sea wall or quay (Fig. 133) connected with the city's original harbour and the trials to determine the course of the N and NE walls of the S peribolos, have been covered in AR 1996-97, 87, based on reports in AEMTH 7. A test at the supposed NW angle of the city walls of the S peribolos (Agios Panteleimon locality) uncovered an E-W and a N-S wall which differed in construction. In the fill between them were a disturbed adult skeleton and a number of projectile weapons-3 iron javelin-heads, I iron and 3 bronze arrow-heads, and 2 complete and 2 broken catapult balls. Loom-weights, nails and fragments of sheet metal were also present, and the finds may have been the debris of a clean-up rather than the result of an attack. Coins suggest a 4th Ct BC date. A small jug was found containing 27 bronze coins of Abdera, minted during two archonships: EFI FIYOEQ and EHlI I-APMIAOX. (ADelt 485-9) An underwater excavation of the breakwater of the anc. harbour was carried out in 1992, within the small modern harbour, by Chr. Samiou of the Marine Antiquities Ephorate. Though badly damaged, it still preserves its anc. form and size (length ca 170m; E-W orientation; up to three courses pre- served). Two construction phases were established; no exact dating is yet possible because of the disturbed stratigraphy in the five test trenches. (ADelt 696) Within the N peribolos, architectural members were turned up on land belonging to Ch. Chatzopoulos during excavation for a water supply. The ensuing investigation uncovered part of what was probably a large building with several building phases, which was destroyed along with the other buildings in the N peribolos when the latter was deserted in the mid 4th-Ct BC. (ADelt 488-9) During cleaning and conservation work in the S peribolos in 1992, part of a spouted marble basin and two fragments of tables with hollows for measuring liquid were found in the coroplasts' workshop. In the R settlement outside of and to the W of the S peribolos (Museum sector), a Byz cist tomb had an earlier inscription built into it, and the base of an inscribed tomb marker was built into another wall in the complex. Both are now in the Archaeological Collection of Abdera. (ADelt 498-9) In the Molos area (outside the city walls, close to the NE corner of the S peribolos) are a number of LC-EHL tumuli. Two of these are located in the Lakkiotes field. The E tumulus was excavated in 1990-91, and part of the W tumulus in 1992. The latter contained seven burials (1 stone sarcophagus, 3 clay larnakes, 2 tile graves and 3 pot burials-- in a pithos and 2 in amphoras). Fifteen cremations were also found in which the corpse had been lowered on a bier into a rectangular pit and burnt there. In one case two people, male and female, had been cremated at the same time. Grave goods were placed in both graves and cremation pits; with the latter they were sometimes burnt in the pyre and sometimes set on its remains afterwards, while in some cases they were placed just outside the crema- tion pit, at the corners. Besides these, there were many sites of funerary offerings in the tumulus. These consisted of either burnt organic material, or groups of pots, either complete or broken. Complete ones may have held liquid offerings and many had a hole. They were frequently set upside-down. The bedrock had often been cut flat or slightly hollowed to accom- modate these offertory groups. (ADelt 489) Chortolivado (formerly Sazli Tsair). Four tombs (a poros sarcophagus and three clay larnakes) were uncovered in G. Zampakes' field during agricultural work. All were robbed and damaged. The sarcophagus contained the mouth of a decorated amphora in the Ionian style and some bones from a male ca 35 years old. A small olpe was reconstructed from sherds just outside one of the larnakes, and another still contained a few human bones. (ADelt 489-90) Lophos ton Skenon (formerly Tsanter Tepe). A particu- larly fine poros sarcophagus in a tumulus in the field of I. Stogiannides was found wrecked by antiquities thieves, who, after removing the cover, smashed up the larnax and the well- preserved skeleton it had contained, apparently using a crowbar for this senseless act of vandalism. (ADelt 490) Myrodato (ca 7km NNW of anc. Abdera). In the field of E. Balabanides in the Badakli locality a built cist tomb and the possible remains of another were discovered, both robbed in antiquity. They may have been Ch, belonging to one of the neighbourhood settlements of historic times. (ADelt 490-1) Tragasia (6km SE of the present village of Abdera, near Myrodato). During an attempt to remove a tumulus in his field, E. Poulios located three large cover slabs which covered a simple pit (2.45 x 1.30m). Though it was found unrobbed, it contained nothing. It was outside the tumulus' circumference, and may have been a Ch burial located near it by accident, belonging to one of the settlements which then existed in the Abdera district. (ADelt 490) Many chance finds from Abdera were handed in to the Archaeological Service. From the N peribolos came a column drum; lamps; clay stamps (bird, griffin, grapes); a lead pyramidal weight and sling bullets; an arrowhead, wedge,and spatula of bronze; a stone axe; and a terracotta female figurine head. The S peribolos produced fragments of three marble statuettes, one of an eagle, another possibly the body of a sphinx; marble architectural fragments; and parts of columnar tombstones, some inscribed. Two bronze arrowheads, a bg lamp, and a pyramidal lead weight were from the wider archaeological area. Palaiochora produced a decorated Ionian</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 97 amphoriskos and an inscribed base; Asprolophos the upper part of an inscribed funerary stele; and Ineli part of a terracotta akroterion with plant decoration. A poros Doric column capital and the abacus of one of marble, of indefinite type, an Ionian column base of Asia Minor type, a column drum and a columnar inscribed tombstone were found in today's village of Abdera. (ADelt 498-500) Polystylon. The continuing excavations at the episcopal church uncovered remnants of a retaining wall that may date to the last phase of the structure. Three burials were uncovered, one in a reused sarcophagus. It is not clear whether the site was used for burials when the church was functioning (10th- 1 Ith Ct). A roughly built structure attached to the N wall of the church was also investigated. (ADelt 520-21) Elaia (21km NW of Orestiada). Finds handed in to the Archaeological Service included part of a marble perirranterion, a marble sculpture of Heracles with his club, and another of a female bust within a moulded frame, the two last-named probably of R date. (ADelt 501) Kalyva (24km NW of Xanthe). In 1992, work on this 4th Ct BC-6th Ct AD fortress consisted of tests on its W side, where there were deeper deposits. Eight strata were present, which confirmed that the three main phases were 4th Ct BC, 2nd Ct BC and 2nd-3rd Cts AD. There was a destruction level in the second half of the 2nd Ct BC, after the suppression of the Macedonian state. There was some evidence for buildings within the walls, and for a central passage which ran from the NE tower towards that in the SW, thus dividing the interior of the fortress into two parts. Amongst the finds in all tests were domestic objects like clay loom-weights and spindle whorls, stamped amphora handles, iron objects and coins. EIA sherds with grooved and impressed decoration were again present in all tests, proving that the peak had once had a settlement of that date, though any strata of that period would have been destroyed by the various construction stages of the fortress. (ADelt 491-2) Makre (11km W of Alexandroupolis, on the coast). Two different sectors of this toumba are being excavated; sector A has remains of the historical period above N strata, and sector B, N remains only. Before excavation, the 5th-4th Cts BC remains in sector A had been equated by some scholars with anc. Zone (see Mesembria, below). In the summary of her investigations since 1988, D. Kallintzi demonstrates that it was neither city nor settlement, but a small trading-post, supporting at most only a few families. It dealt in amphoras (many had stamped handles; most were from the N Aegean-the most remote from Kos) and their contents; bg and occasional rf tableware of Attic type and a limited range of forms; and some grey ware. Lamps, also Attic, loom-weights of all kinds, many with stamps of ring bezels, spindle-whorls, and plain domestic pottery may have been for the use of the inhabitants or for trade. The few metal objects included a sling bullet with the name HAMFIAOY and lead clamps. Fragments of clay altars and perirranteria, a figurine of Silenus, a draped female figurine torso and remains of eight others may have been associated with the inhabitants' religious practices. Coins were not numerous, and barter may have been the rule. After Philip II conquered the area in 340 BC, Attic imports ceased, and indications of the trading-post's continuance in HL-ER times are slight. It revived somewhat in the lst-3rd Cts AD, when a long wall of unexplained purpose was built. In the 1 lth Ct AD the mound and its environs were part of the cemetery for a Byz settlement on the site of today's village. (AEMTH 10, 895-908, 913-16) In 1992, work in sector A consisted of tests sited on the periphery of the mound in order to establish the site's limits. Fourteen tests to the S of the toumba and the associated cave and two to the W had negative results. Of five tests to the N, one had historical remains, two had strata of the EIA, a first occurrence on this site, and two had disturbed, undatable stratigraphy. Tests NNE of, and about 200m beyond, the boundaries of the site located PR remains at a depth of 2m: a carefully-constructed floor or yard surface, and a rubbish pit with many flint tools and flakes. The sparse, small, very damp sherds were of red clay, from handmade vessels; they were totally different from the known N pottery of Makre. The PR remains were found beneath a thick stratum of sediment without any archaeological indications, which had occurred in other trenches, but had been taken for stereo; in the light of the 1992 findings, it will have to be re-investigated. (ADelt 494-6) N. Efstratiou summarises the results of the N excavations in sector B, which began in 1988. By 1996, 16 4x4m trenches had been opened on the summit and sides of the mound. The settlement has two major phases, Makri I (the earlier) and Makri II, separated by a clear destruction level which gave calibrated 6th millennium dates. Despite this destruction, the site's pottery changed relatively little throughout its history, making sub-phases difficult to distinguish. Makri I was apparently confined to the mound's summit. Makri II gradually occupied the whole mound and possibly somewhat beyond it. At the centre of this settlement was an unusual, communal(?), storage area, at least 40 m2 in extent, which may have had an upper storey or half-floor. Main walls were indicated by thickly-grouped post-holes with wattle-and-daub and perhaps also pis6 sub-divisions. Within it were many large unbaked vessels set upright in the floor, carefully-made, well-finished clay installations, and a central pit containing objects of unknown use. In five adjacent trenches there were similar remains, with more clay installations for heating, larger ones perhaps as sleeping platforms, hearths with remains of fire, storage pits in the floors and household vessels broken in situ. No yard or outside space was recognised in this subsidiary area, ca 70 m2 in extent, or in the communal storage area it surrounded. 10m N of this were normal, individual houses, albeit with walls on the same orientation as those of the central storage area. Areas further down the slopes did not have as many successive floors as the centre, and may not have been occupied for so long. Tests well N of the mound may have reached pre-N levels without pottery but with remains of a microlithic stone tool industry. Many specialist studies on various aspects of the site and its finds were in progress. (AEMTH 10, 881-95, 908-12) In the 1992 season, work in sector B concentrated on the storage area referred to above. When baulks were removed, more storage vessels, installations and post-holes were uncovered, and careful removal of fill between the previously-excavated large storage pots revealed many more small ones, and large quantities of sherds of excellent quality. A test below the central storage area showed only successive floor levels of the mound's previous sub-phases, with no indication of earlier storage. A test to the S of the storage area, adjacent to the square where three N burials were found in 1991, had N floors, installations and platforms which were well-preserved but partially destroyed by historical remains like those in sector A. (ADelt 494-6) Part of a small marble column with eight flutes, a marble architectural fragment and part of a ?ECh marble thorakion were found in the fields and other areas of the site. (ADelt 501)</page><page sequence="98">98 DAVID BLACKMAN Fig. 134 Maroneia. Extensive testing was undertaken in the SW sector of the site before the construction of a road between Platanite and the harbour at Agios Charalambos. The remains of part of the SW peribolos were uncovered, at a point where it turns to the W, forming a rectangular tower. Outside the peribolos nothing was found, but all the tests within it contained settle- ment remains. Amongst these, at Ochthos near Agios Charala- mbos, was the greater part of a large HL building with a peristyle court (Fig. 134), constructed in the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC and destroyed early in the 2nd Ct BC (ADelt 493-94). A description of this appeared in AR 1996-97, 89, based on the report in AEMTH 6. A gold Byz coin was a chance find at Ochthos; and part of an inscribed marble altar and two fragments from another inscription were found built into the yard wall of a village house. (ADelt 500) A brief Greek-French surface survey with the object of locating amphora workshops in the wider Maroneia district concentrated mainly on coastal areas. Remains of Byz kilns and workshop dumps were found. (ADelt 498) Further excavations of the ECh basilica revealed an earlier R settlement phase under the atrium. The overlying mosaic floor was removed. The R remains include a paved floor, a well and part of a conduit. Finds from the Byz phase include fine glazed pottery and many coins of the 10th to the 13th Cts, including an extremely rare milaresion of Nikephoros III (1078-81) and his consort Maria the Alan. (ADelt 523-24) New finds in the Byz church at Agios Charalambos are discussed in AEMTH 10, 865-70. The earlier phases of this church, which date to the 9th Ct, were partly investigated and rare wall-paintings (jewelled ornate cross motif) were located. After an early 10th-Ct destruction, the right aisle was used for a chapel, replaced in turn by the 12th-Ct cathedral church, indicated by the presence of a synthronon. Mesembria (anc. Zone). A very brief report on the unusual building block with the amphoras in the NW part of the city is given in ADelt 494. This was covered in AR 1996-97, 89-90, based on the detailed account in AEMTH 6. In AEMTH 10, 917-26, P. Tsatsopoulou has an interesting discussion of the towns of the Samothracian peraia as well as a summary of the last decade of work at the site. The city, now excavated in many areas, was laid out on the Hippodamian plan, with its avenues and streets oriented in accordance with the boundaries of the coast to the S, a seasonal stream to the E and the. city wall to the W. Most of the buildings uncovered were of Fig. 135 domestic character, but there was evidence of occupation debris in places: kilns, remains of metal-working, figurine moulds, and workshop equipment. The commercial centre of the city has not yet been located, and a short underwater survey failed to find any harbour works. Vessels presumably beached on the shore on either side of the city. The sheer numbers of used amphoras set on end as a kind of damp course in some of the houses suggest the owners were engaged in trade by sea and probably with the object of supplying the Thracian hinterland. Public buildings include the shrine to Demeter (discovered in 1973) and recently a temple to Apollo, set in a building complex including a paved court and an L-shaped stoa. The temple is identified by numerous inscribed sherds; the earliest finds, including a fine marble torso of a kouros, date to the 6th Ct BC It is unlikely to be coincidence that three different issues of coins of anc. Zone, found in very large numbers at this site, and comparatively seldom elsewhere, all bear the head of Apollo on the obverse. The identification of the site as anc. Zone seems virtually certain, and the long-standing name 'Mesembria' is only retained to avoid confusion. By the end of 1996, the site had been provided with good access, fenced, landscaped, equipped with laboratories, storerooms and all the necessary infrastructure of a major site, and was open to the public. Mischos. Unlicensed bulldozing by the Forestry Dept. on the height of Komoro destroyed the building remains of a sanctu- ary to the Thracian horseman, identified by part of a sculpture, and a bronze figurine of the hero, and two complete amphoris- koi with pointed bases, particularly associated with this cult. Remains of many such sanctuaries have been found on peaks and high places in all parts of anc. Thrace; the cult flourished particularly in Imperial times, 2nd-4th Cts AD. The limited excavation following the destruction recovered bronze figurines of a mounted horseman, two bronze horses from similar groups, one with a silver fibula through its tail (Fig. 135), a bronze statuette of the young Apollo (ADelt pl. 136a), bronze kylikes and statuette bases, a bronze ring, a ring stone with a representation of Athena, iron knives, more of the amphoriskoi, and bronze coins of Probus (276-282 AD), Maximian (286-305 AD), Constantine the Great (336-337 AD) and Constans (337- 346 AD). Earlier Forestry Dept. terracing on the same hill turned up EIA sherds. (ADelt 493)</page><page sequence="99">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 99 Papikion Oros. Lenos. The second season of excavations at this important monastery site uncovered 30 pit and cist burials around the church. Of these, six were especially well built and all were contemporary with the church's use. Many tombs were reused and the cemetery does not appear to have covered a large area. Evidence was found in some of the graves for the use of wooden coffins. tombs 23 and 24 were attached to the outer S wall and had the form of acrosolia and may have been intended for the hegoumens of the monastery during its second period (late I1 th-12th Ct). A small adjoining room (5 x 4.50m) was uncovered to the SE and may have been used as a funerary chapel. The terminus post quem for the room was established by aspra of Andronikos II (1282-1328) and Venetian groats. These may date the final destruction of the monastery as well. A small cistern was found under the exo- narthex of the church and appears to date from the first period of the church (early 11th Ct). (ADelt 521-3) Samothrace. James McCredie reports on study of materials from excavations in the sanctuary of the Great Gods in Samothrace, carried out by the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, for the ASCS in 1997: "Study and maintenance were conducted in the storerooms of the museum and on the site. East hill: marble blocks from the dedication of Philip and Alexander were relocated and renumbered, in preparation for the final publication of the building. Hall of choral dancers (former Temenos): marble blocks from the excavations of 1949-1951 were re-identified and labelled; all ceiling beams and geison-sima blocks from those excavations were re-measured and the basic scheme of the roof worked out; portions of the foundation were resurveyed. Museum: pottery on exhibit, which had been restored with obsolete techniques, was disassembled and restored according to present standards; architectural restorations whose appear- ance had deteriorated were repainted; metal objects in the museum and in storage were surveyed, those requiring treat- ment were treated, and all were protected. Text and illustrations for new revised and enlarged Greek and English editions of the Guide were submitted to the press. It should be ready for the summer of 1998; various vegetation and washed dirt were cleaned from various parts of the site, to supplement the work done by the Ephoreia." Palaiapolis N cemetery. A report (with good plan) in ADelt 496-7 on the rescue excavation of 31 graves here has already been covered in AR 1996-97, 91, based on the account in AEMTH 6. A systematic survey of the coastal zone of Samoth- race was undertaken, with the object of locating amphora workshops recorded workshop dumps at Kvara and Phonias. (ADelt 498) In the Votsos holding at Vasilikos, E of Palaiapolis, a bulldozer turned up a marble pedimental funerary stele inscribed ATIOAAOAd POX/OPEXTIOY. (ADelt 502).

Bakirtzis describes the clearance of a rectangular secular building which was probably a hostel for pilgrims travelling to and from the sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace, which lies immediately opposite the site. The building was divided into two sectors by a N-S party wall, presumably to provide separate accommodation for men and women. Each sector consisted of numerous rooms set round a large internal court. Originally the entrances to each sector had been in the north, leading from a road and giving directly onto the courtyards; when more space was required, and rooms were added to the N of each sector, subsidiary entrances on the S side, which gave onto a wide verandah overlooking the sea,</page><page sequence="100">100 DAVID BLACKMAN were used. Sherds and coins collected were of the 2nd/3rd Cts. AD, when worship of the hero Maron was established at Synaxe, and the 6th Ct AD, when the ECh basilica was functioning. (Further minor alterations were made to the hostel during the latter period). Neither the basilica nor the hostel survived the 7th Ct AD. (AEMTH 10, 873-9) Thracian tumuli. D. Triantaphyllos and D.

In 1992 the 20th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities was much occupied with the preparation of the Myrina Museum on Lemnos: both the cataloguing, classification and conservation of material for exhibition and also the repair, decoration and reorganisation of the building itself. Museum work also included the conservation and cataloguing of the 1991 and 1992 finds stored at Chios Museum, Lemnos Museum and Mytilene Museum. In Mytilene, in situ conservation took place of the mosaics discovered in 1991 on Odos Aginoros, while the mosaics excavated on Odoi Herakleias and Agraphiotou were transferred to the Museum for conservation. Chios: town. In the Rizari district trenching work for the laying of a new drain uncovered a large deposit of R pottery, some 14m in length and 0.7m thick although much of this had been destroyed by the mechanical digger. The deposit con- tained parts of large vases, stamnoi, amphoras, stamped handles, parts of kantharoi, kyathoi, lamps and unguentaria of LR date. In the Kofina district further trenching work for the laying of a new drain brought to light a cist tomb constructed of Thymiana stone. In the disturbed soil from earlier drainage work were found parts of two skulls, bones, an iron strigil, and fragments of glass vessels. Trial trenches dug on the Skrini plot revealed late antique building remains. Work was continued by the 3rd Byz Ephorate. Rescue excavation in the Agia Anna Kapelas district uncovered part of a R bath. Surviving remains included floors coated with waterproof plaster, walls built of small stones and mortar, and a hypocaust. Associated with the hypocaust was found a clay pipe. Pottery finds were few, mainly unpainted sherds of R date. (ADelt 525-6) A. Simossi describes material retrieved from the S part of the modern harbour and discusses the location and extent of the anc. harbour (ADelt 702-3). The material was mainly amphoras and pottery, but included also wooden objects such as a pulley. Kato Phana. Lesley Beaumont (BSA) and Aglaia Archonti- dou-Argyri report: "The first fieldwork season of the Kato Phana Archae- ological Project took place in June 1997 as a major collaborative venture between the BSA and the 20th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities.

Whitbread, and Dr Y.. Basiakos of the Demokritos Research Centre, for geophysical and geologi- cal/geomorphological analyses in the region. Reference by Strabo to anc. Phanai, with its deep harbour and temple of Apollo, led to the first investigation of the coastal site at mod. Kato Phana in SW Chios in 1913 and 1915 by the Greek Archaeological Service under K. Kourouniotis (ADelt 1 [1915], 72-85 and 2 [1916], 190-212). His work at the site was continued in 1934 by the BSA under W. Lamb (BSA 35 [1934-35], 138-164). Proof of the identification of mod. Kato Phana with anc. Phanai was provided when they uncovered the NE section of the foundations of an A and C temple and parts of the surrounding peribolos walls, together with pottery sherds bearing inscriptions to Apollo Phanaios. The archaeological evidence further attested a very long history of activity at the site, spanning at least the G to EByz periods. Even today, the site continues to fulfil its cultic role through ongoing Ch worship in the little chapel of Agia Markella, which stands atop the pagan ruins and is constructed largely of reused material from the earlier sanctuary structures. In re-establishing a fieldwork project at Kato Phana, the Anglo-Greek research programme aims: (a) to clarify and investigate further the remains of the sanctuary area; (b) to locate the anc. coastline and to investigate the existence of any preserved anc. harbour facilities, which probably now lie buried under accumulated silt deposits in the area between the sanctuary and the mod. coastline; and (c) to investigate the relationship of anc. Phanai to the site of Emporio, only some 9 km E of Kato Phana, and already fully excavated by the BSA between 1952 and 1955. Finally, by thus seeking to understand and interpret Kato Phana in its broader topographi- cal and historical context, it will also prove possible to go some way towards clarifying the relationship between a major Gr cult centre and its wider locale, and to understand how, across time, each impacted on the other. With these aims in mind, the first fieldwork season concen- trated on examination of the immediate coastal hinterland of the sanctuary site. Intensive surface survey, encompassing an area of approx. 3 km2, covered the valley floor and the hills surrounding the cult centre. First, in the process of surveying the sanctuary site itself, some preliminary cleaning work was begun to clear the anc. remains of overgrown vegetation. This proved very productive, with the emergence from the under- growth of sections of the sanctuary architecture already excavated earlier this century by Kourouniotis and Lamb. Following the cleaning operation, a 1:20 scale plan of the</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 101 visible temple foundations was drawn by the 20th Ephorate's personnel. The foundations of the temple's E front currently lie exposed to a length of 8.5m (Fig. 137) and, though much of the area was subsequently backfilled, Kourouniotis and Lamb traced its N flank for just under 26m, this perhaps representing roughly half of the temple's original length. It was certainly a very imposing structure, both in its dimensions and in its careful construction from local fine grey-blue limestone, enlivened by white marble columns and decorative elements. It was built in the 2nd half of the 6th Ct, perhaps towards 500 BC, and was probably subjected to later rebuilding or refurbishment. The BSA team, meanwhile, began a 1:100 scale plan of the whole sanctuary area to show the temple remains in relation to the sanctuary peribolos walls, the later Ch (?Justinianic) basilica constructed above the temple remains, and the present-day chapel of Agia Markella standing at the centre of the site. The outer of the two peribolos walls, roughly contemporary with the A temple, is today only partially exposed above ground, but was traced by Kourouniotis and Lamb to N, W and E of the temple foundations and was again picked up in 1997 by geophysical testing (magnetometry) carried out by the BSA's Fitch Laboratory team. The earlier A sanctuary is represented by a second, more curvilinear peri- bolos wall, and possibly by a set of poros foundations underly- ing the blue-grey limestone foundations of the later A temple. In addition to the planning of the in situ sanctuary remains, recording also took place of the many re-used limestone ashlar blocks and fragmentary marble column drums and bases which now lie scattered about the Kato Phana area. In the course of this work, a fragmentary inscription (Fig. 138), preserving part of the name of Apollo, and cut into the surface of what was probably a dedicatory stone vessel, was discovered and transferred to Chios Archaeological Museum. Surface survey further succeeded in locating, on the NW side of the Kato Phana Valley, the quarry source of the grey- blue limestone used for the sanctuary construction. Dr Yiannis Basiakos of the Demokritos Research Centre noted the anc. tool marks clearly visible on the quarry rock faces (Fig. 139). The location of the quarry would suggest that quarried lime- stone blocks were rolled down the hillside to the rocky shoreline located directly below, and were then transported by boat the short distance across the bay to the sanctuary. Field survey also located sherd concentrations in two areas to the S of the sanctuary site. The first of these, situated on the lower hill slopes, comprised ceramic material and some built remains dating to the LR and EByz periods, and presumably contemporary with the ECh sanctuary at Phana. To the W of this, the Nepagos hill, overlooking the sea, produced some evidence of BA occupation. Here, on the peak of the hill, finds included pottery sherds, some worked flint and obsidian, and a series of low stone-built walls. Further, on the last day of the fieldwork season, an additional sherd concentration of BA character was detected on the hill slopes NE of the sanctuary site: this area now awaits full sampling. Nevertheless, it would already seem safe to conclude that the deep, sheltered harbour at Kato Phana attracted man to its shores from a very early date, and it will be interesting to see whether further excava- tion at the sanctuary site produces any evidence of pre-G period (cult) activity. Field survey of the valley floor and lower hill slopes otherwise revealed sherd concentrations limited to a relatively small area around the cult centre, so it seems possible to conclude that the settlement to which the sanctuary belonged did not lie in the immediate coastal area of Kato Phana. In view of this, it seems very likely that the settlement primarily associated with the sanctuary lies at the head of the /:: 4:::- Fig. 138 ............ IMK:: i00 4 4,???- ? :I:~ WI Fig. 139 Phana Valley, some 4-5 km distant, in the area known locally as Managros. Here, remains of a Med settlement overlie visible traces of A-C period architecture and sherd material, while the Kastri hill above preserves evidence of fortified remains possibly originating as early as the BA. This diachronic mosaic of hilltop PR settlement and A, C and Byz remains distributed across the land below, thus seems to repeat the multi-period occupation pattern already recovered at the coastal end of the Phana Valley. In order fully to understand the wider topo- graphical and historical context of the cult centre it is therefore necessary that the Managros and Kastri area should now be subjected to intensive archaeological field survey. Attempts to identify the possible site of any anc. harbour facilities in the area to W and N of the sanctuary were made by the BSA's Fitch Laboratory team using a Geoscan FM36 fluxgate gradiometer. The depth of the silt and stream bed deposits soon, however, proved this to be an unsuitable method of exploration. Meanwhile, it is hoped that the anc. coastline may be located in future fieldwork seasons by undertaking a programme of core drilling in the area between the sanctuary and the present-day shoreline." Lemnos Myrina. Trial trenches dug on the Rosbani plot in the Tsas district (see ADelt 44, 406; 45, 398; 46, 369), brought to light remains of part of an industrial complex which was already</page><page sequence="102">102 DAVID BLACKMAN Ir 1, ~ : :: m w x:.:.:: i~~~iii:- ...... . ...: :::: Fig. 140 known from excavation on neighbouring plots (see ADelt 44, 406). A series of small rooms was found and a section of a stone conduit. The layer over the walls was characterised by intense burning, with many sherds of the HL period (2nd Ct BC), moulds and fragments of relief-decorated skyphoi, moulds and figurine fragments, and lumps of clay bearing finger-prints. Also found was a seal mould, fragments of relief-decorated tiles, lamps, loom-weights and coins. At a depth of 3.22m was discovered grave I, covered with the upper section of the body of a large amphora bearing a stamp on the lower part of its neck. It contained the reburied bones of two people and a small glass vase. Grave II consisted of an infant burial in an amphora. At a depth of 3.87m a level with A pottery was reached. Excavation was completed on the site of the future Pro- fessional Technical Training College of Myrina, where part of the HL and R cemetery of the town had been discovered. In 1992 work concentrated on three tile graves, devoid of offerings, an infant pot burial containing a gold wreath of 28 oak leaves, and a stone sarcophagus which contained at least five disturbed burials. Offerings recovered from the graves included parts of gold wreaths, glass beads, strigils and coins of the R period. Of particular importance was a grave contain- ing a woman, with the pot burial of an infant placed at her feet: the burial may therefore be that of mother and child. The remains of long walls probably belong to a peribolos con- structed at a later date. To the same period belongs a kiln with circular chamber (approx. diam. 2.8m). The kiln deposit yielded large quantities of stone which had been used for the production of lime. Excavation was continued in-the Avlonas district on the Tratarou plot (see ADelt 46, 371; AR 1996-97, 92). In the W part of the plot work concentrated on walls of the A period. The wall deposit contained much early Lemnian pottery of the 7th-6th Cts BC. Many of the sherds appear to join, and are decorated with maeanders, spirals and various linear motifs. W of the walls a well was partly excavated. In the N part of the plot remains of a HL peribolos wall were recovered, part of which was found to have been constructed already in the A period. The deposit here contained a small quantity of unpainted coarse wares. The wall preserved two entrances, one on the seaward and one on the townward side, suggesting that a small harbour was located here. Two further wells were found near the entrances to the peribolos, of which the S well could be dated to the HL period and the W well to the A period. The latter contained much ceramic material, animal .. . .. . - - -- - --. . . . .. . . .. . . . . .. . . NO:: ;A3 :::; ..xr. 06, Wil? :iiiinii~i::'WWII. Fig. 141 bones and a skull. The skeleton of a sacrificial calf with its legs bound was found in the area bounded by walls 142P and 142ac, and another skeleton of a sacrificial animal was found between walls 194 and 173. In addition to excavation, some conservation and restoration work was also carried out. The building remains, small finds and inscription found in 1991 suggest that the site can be identified as a shrine of Artemis. In addition, written sources refer to the existence of a sanctuary of Artemis-Selene outside the walls at Anaphane, which may be identified with present-day Avlona. This was an open-air sanctuary, suitable for a goddess' with celestial associations, surrounded by ancillary buildings with successive phases of use from the A to the HL period; the excavation continues. (ADelt 539) Poliochne. The work of the Italian School in 1992 (A.G. Benvenuti and S. Tint: ADelt 540) was already reported in AR 1992-93, 65. During the season of 1997, work was continued in the N and SW sectors of the settlement, under the direction of Prof. Santo Tin6. The extension of trench H/east to the N and to the S brought to light constructions of both private and public character. As regards the latter, it was discovered that the fortification wall (Green period), part of which had been unearthed in the 1993-5 excavations, continued to the N for a length of 16m, where it stopped suddenly at the edge of a small valley. In the new excavation area, the structures of the Green period seem to have continued in use during the Red period, with various layers of habitation added over the old retaining walls. In the same sector was unearthed a square space (5m by 5m), with a central pillar for the support of the roof (Fig. 140: view from S). A large section of a thick compact red earth layer, in which were preserved remains of burnt wooden posts, was discovered in situ. Excavations in trench H/west brought to light, just under the surface, a kind of stone platform, probably the foundation for a very strong mud brick fortification wall, 2m thick, and high enough to serve as a real defensive wall for the town on the NW side. A section of the same fortification wall, preserved four courses high, formed apparently one side of a square 'tower', the meeting point for the N-S and the E-W sections of the wall. These constructions date to the Green period, but they continued in use in the Red period, when they were incorpor- ated into the large mud brick fortification system (Fig. 141: general view from SE). Trench X, located behind Gate 10, so as not to disturb its blocking wall, clarified the relation of the gate to the ramp and</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 103 the Bouleuterion; the possible connection between the three features dates both the period of the use of the gate, and its blocking, to the developed Blue period, a time when it was necessary to strengthen the collapsing S fortification wall. Area S of small road 108: the aim in the 1997 season was to complete the clearing of the rooms behind the wall, which Bernabb Brea suggested were part of a 'palace'. The only interesting feature about these three rooms was a system for the collection of liquids, consisting of a small slab-built drain, which led to a buried pithos, where the cleaning of the liquids was probably conducted. The whole system seems to date from the. Red period. Lesbos Agia Paraskevi. Archaeological site of Klopedi (for the excavation of the temple see ADelt 1922-25, Suppl. 41-44). The clearing of the site revealed the dimensions of the earlier building as 16.7 x 28.5m and the stereobate surviving to three courses. Along the S side of the stereobate ran a retaining wall of large irregular stones. The second, A temple, was peripteral: the three-stepped krepis and the walls of the sekos survive. The cult statue base, measuring 4.1 x 3.45m, was cleared of soil and undergrowth: its outer walls are constructed in Lesbian masonry style while the central portion of the base is packed with small stones. At a distance of 26.2m from the W edge of the archaeological site were found the remains of an apsidal building of, as yet, unknown character; work continues. (ADelt 534) Methymna. A trial excavation on the land of the rural clinic of Methymna brought to light anc. building remains, together with A pottery. The upper levels were much disturbed. Trial trenches before construction work on the Krallis plot uncovered LR graves. The rescue excavation which followed recovered 5 LR graves. To an earlier phase, though also LR, belonged building remains found to the N. The few ceramic finds from the deposit can be dated to the LR-ECh period. (ADelt 534-6) Mikro Nisi. Inspection took place of the island opposite Petra, following reports of the presence of tombs. The island was indeed found to be strewn with tile graves, some of which had been looted. On the shore and a little further inland architectural remains and sherds of the R period were seen. (ADelt 540) Moria Quarry. The work of the 20th Ephorate and the Canadian Institute in 1992 (ADelt 540) was reported already in AR 1992-93, 65. Mytilene. In the Koulbara district construction work brought to light building remains of various phases and construction styles. The upper levels showed evidence of great disturbance due to successive use of the area from the A to the post-Byz period. Dating to the post-Byz period were a well and remains of clay pipes, while a further series of pipes were dated to the C/EHL period; a reused Aeolic column capital was found, built into one of the C/EHL pipes. This deposit also contained many broken vases with relief decoration, together with moulds of the LHL period, originating from a nearby workshop. In the SW sector of the site HL walls built in isodomic style bordered a stone-paved floor; walls constructed of small stones and mortar were of R date. The lowest strata revealed walls and fine quality pottery of the A period. In the district of Epano Skala a wall built in pseudo- isodomic style 0.7m wide, oriented N-S, with four courses of masonry, each 1.07m high, was uncovered to a length of 6.3m. Associated with the wall were sherds of West slope ware, bg, coarse wares and figurines, dating it to the HL period. A subsequent repair to the S section of the wall incorporated a reused Doric column capital. Drainage trenching in the area of the Bareia-Akleidi road uncovered a cist tomb oriented NE-SW. The T, lined with large stone slabs and covered with a monolithic slab, was unlooted and contained 14 gold olive leaves and a gold coin bearing the head of Alexander and the inscription AAEEANAPOY. Also found were two bronze fibulae and two iron strigils. In the Synoikismos district drainage trenching revealed antiquities in several locations: on Odos Markou Agrippa, R building remains were brought to light. To the earlier phase belong sections of a mosaic floor, located beneath a stone paved floor. Also recovered was part of a grave stele, inscribed: KYEYQTH.../XAIPE. Finds associated with walls of the later phase included pottery, figurines and lamps of the Ist- 2nd Ct AD. On Odos Diophanous further mosaic floors were discovered. The ensuing rescue excavation brought to light a number of walls and a kiln wall built of half-worked blocks and mortar; clay slabs lined the floor of the kiln. The associated deposit contained burnt sherds from pithoi, tiles and bricks. On Odos Alphaiou parts of walls and the hypocaust of a bath building were recorded. On Odos Agraphiotou another mosaic floor was uncovered, dating to the LR period. Only part of the border decoration framing the central representation survived. Within an rec- tangular frame (opus tessellatum) were set diamonds and circles, the centre of which contained pictorial themes (hunting in the circular medallions and deer in the diamond medallions, in opus vermiculatum), offset by vegetal motifs. S of the mosaic were located additional rooms of the same building, with floors of lime plaster. S of the house containing the mosaic, remains of another house came to light, of inferior construction. N of the mosaic was located a well, and a clay pipe leading from the well. The stratigraphy of the entire excavation was much disturbed by the drainage trenching, but finds included rg and bg sherds, unpainted wares and many figurines. In the same area further anc. building remains came to light. A destruction level extended across the excavated area, containing clay tile fragments, much stone, plaster and sherds. At the S end of the trench a wall and stone threshold were discovered in situ. Finds consisted of much LHL pottery, figurines and corroded bronze coins. Rescue excavation in the district of Epano Skala, after the discovery of remains of wall-painting and of marble architec- tural fragments, revealed parts of two stone and mortar walls and a small quantity of pottery, mostly grooved unpainted wares of the LR period. Drainage trenching on Odos Botsi uncovered a cist tomb containing an unpainted kyathos, an oinochoe and 14 bg unguentaria, while on Odos Bostani 7 graves belonging to the S cemetery of the town came to light. Four tombs were cist graves and two were tile graves. One cist grave (xxx) con- tained a child burial: offerings here consisted of vases and of Eros, horse, satyr and rider figurines. With the exception of cist grave xxxii, which was located beneath cist grave xxxi, the burials had been disturbed. Surviving offerings included figurines, pelikes, clay and glass unguentaria, and bronze coins dating to the LHL and ER period. Further tombs came to light during building work at the 6th Demotiko Scholeio. Rescue excavation found in the S of the plot part of the R cemetery of the town. Five stone-built cist tombs were recorded, together with 14 tile graves, pot burials, ash urns and many makeshift burials, the majority of these</page><page sequence="104">104 DAVID BLACKMAN ::::I:: : _::-:::-::::i:::_ :--(:-:-:--::-i?i-::::::::::::::::::-::: :___::::i:::-_:: ::::?:?:::-:::::::-::---i:i-i:i-.-:---i: ::::::: Il'-i-i:::;-ii-:ii-::-:::-:: . _?-:_--::-:-:_:::?:::::-:::::::_:_:-:-:- ::::::::_:::_ ::_::::_:_: _,_:_::_:___::::_: -'-:--:-':-::-----'?:::':'::-:-`--:'::-- iiiiiii-:i:iiiii:ii:i'iiiii ::: :' -- : :: -:-i-::'i-ii:--l:: :: :--:::-:::-:::- : i.:-i----i-- :-:l::::i:_-i::i-i i: I:~:- _j::i::-j:i:i i: ... _::::: ::::::::: ::--: :: j: ::---:::- -::-----:--i: - - - i:fig -: iiiii:i';?~ is i?:?. ~Y: L :---::::::: : ~7sd l :-i-:-~:::_i:i::?:- : :: :: : :: : :- - --:::-:r?-'i~j~i~n~ ";~ :::~::; ::?:-::::~-:.: ir ~i?_il?:-:: :::::::.: - ~~:i-:i:i:::-i:::-i:-i:-:i;:-:_:--:~~~:i *-~ :? *:i:::: i :::: :::i::o JG ~:::::-::?:::_::: :-? :i ?ji r: ~i~i.B lei~ ai~i~ 8~me~a;6~aa~r;i~ .i":"~ wi a ~iZ~i~:iQ~ i -:r ?i . : r'xjlEIl*POII1E~: Fig. 142 being unlooted. Particularly notable was the high density of the graves and the variety of burial types. All of the cist graves were stone-and-mortar-built and contained successive burials. Successive makeshift inhumation graves were recorded in between the cist and tile graves, together with the pot burials and cinerary urns. Particularly frequent grave offerings were clay and glass unguentaria, lamps, mirrors, jewellery and coins. In addition, the SW part of the plot revealed a stone-paved road 20m long and 3.5m wide. (ADelt 526-31) Panagiouda. Construction work on the Lorentzini plot brought to light cist graves of the post-Byz period. The graves were stone-built, and incorporated reused architectural frag- ments of the ECh period. Further architectural members of ECh date built into the adjacent chapel of Agios Georgios suggest that an ECh basilica once stood in the area. Beneath five graves was found a wall, dated by the associated ceramic material to the LR period. (ADelt 531) Petra. A section of anc. stone walling was uncovered in the Kabaki district; possibly part of a peribolos, it was carelessly constructed, with a width varying from 0.6 to 0.7m. A few LHL sherds were recovered. (ADelt 536) Skala Eresou. Rescue excavation brought to light small sections of anc. stone walls. The deposit was much disturbed, but the foundation level of the walls contained sherds of A date. (ADelt 536) ......... . ~ :::: :: . . .. .....:- -mar- 'ev: :::::::::: Fig. 143 Skala Polychnitou. Rescue excavation at the N end of Skala Polychnitou revealed walls carelessly constructed from semi-worked stones and rectangular stone slabs jointed with mortar, an entrance threshold and a stone-paved floor (A2) with red plaster. Over the whole extent of the excavation stretched a layer of tiles 0.2-0.3m thick resulting from the collapse of the roof of the building. The excavation deposit produced scanty finds. The building remains can be dated to the LR or ECh period. (ADelt 536-7) CYCLADES AND SAMOS Delos. Work in the Museum is described in ADelt 544-5, including work on the sculpture display by N. Zapheiropoulos and the mosaic from the Ilot des Bijoux. Conservation work on the site is also described. (ADelt 545-6) Jean Charles Moretti (French School) reports on work at the theatre and the theatre cistern in 1997: "Two campaigns of work and study were devoted to digging test trenches in the stage building, and listing and ordering stray blocks in the cavea, and blocks previously removed from the cistern. The excavation of 1997 had three objectives: to clear the gutter at the foot of the W portico of the stage; to reveal the foundation of the stairway which led to the terrace covering the proskenion; and to examine the foundations of three of the column-base slabs (E-3-E5). The open air gutter at the foot of the pillared portico along the W side of the stage (Fig. 142: seen from the S) was cleared for 8.8m. Over this entire length it was cut into the natural rock, and was interrupted by two deeper holes which acted as sumps for the water drained off. The study of the stage building led us to restore for the terraced covering of the proskenion a single access by an open- air stairway at the far N end of the construction. This year we cleared its foundations. It consisted of a granite block 1.65m NS by 0.625m EW, which extended the back wall of the skene to the N at its foundation level. (Fig. 143, viewed from the E). At the proskenion (Fig. 144: view from the W) a trench 4.15m NS by 1.50m EW was dug on both sides of the column- base slabs E3-E5, revealing that they rested directly on the natural granite which had been cut into a little to receive them. The trench also revealed some rock cuttings on very different alignments. None had been cut during the installation of slabs E3-E5 and it is likely that they all either postdate or are</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 105 .....:: .. .... am-;? Fig. 144 contemporary with the latter. We brought to light an underground passage between E3 and E4, which was filled in in the first half of the 1st Ct BC. Its EW direction is similar to that of the axis of the theatre. On the continuation of the passage, to the E of the area excavated this year, there are two large slabs of gneiss which constitute the covering of the underground passage in the orchestra. Their presence alone shows that the passage extends at least 2m in front of the fagade of the proskenion. Several post holes, dug in the bedrock on both sides of the column-base slabs, were brought to light. We suggest that these are the receptacles for the poles of scaffolding used in the construction of the proskenion. A hollow in the form of an EW ditch extends between slabs E4 and E5 in a direction similar to that of the axis of the theatre. The destination of this cavity as well as the date at which it was filled in is not clear, because the excavation showed that it had already been emptied by our predecessors." A. Famoux reports on the 1997 campaign on the peribolos wall: "The object of the campaign was to establish the date of the peribolos wall (GD26) in its E section. We opened six squares along the circuit wall (and often opened up only half). The real difficulty lay in identifying the modem trenches and fills since the area was explored by L. Bizard (1904-1907), then by J. Treheux and H. Gallet de Santerre (1947-1948). Nevertheless, we are able to extract the following results: Up to the 7th-6th Ct BC the area was marshy and sandy, doubtless because of the Inopos of which we found, as in 1995, sand and clay beds in E2. Archaeological remains consisted of stray sherds or trodden levels (El). In the 5th Ct a building was constructed in the N of the area explored this year. It consisted of the W wall to the N and a turn to the W still visible, as well as several blocks to the E, and it was cut into by the peribolos wall of the Monument of the Bulls (GD 24) and by the actual peribolos wall. These walls consist of large blocks of granite and small slabs of gneiss. They were dated to a late period by J. Treheux but a floor in situ was unearthed this year in E2: resting on a layer of stones and sherds compacted on top of layers of sand, it contained material from the 5th Ct BC. During the 4th Ct BC the area was filled in on the S (P2) with building blocks (granite, gneiss and marble), tiles, pottery and iron dross in large quantity as well as crucible fragments. The material was examined by Fr. Blonde and consisted of bg ware with palmettes and red figures. It was possible to distin- guish this ancient fill from the modern fill above, thanks particularly to the presence of layers of earth. This important fill made it possible to fill up a natural depression in the granite at the bottom of which we found a green and white clayey layer containing material of the 6th Ct BC. It is probable that this work was carried out after the construction of the Monument of the Bulls and the E peribolos wall. The study of the peribolos wall itself was made difficult by previous excavations as well as by the restoration work undertaken since 1907. Rarely are the layers in place along the foundations. The foundations are poor, consisting of blocks of gneiss or granite, or slabs of gneiss laid in one or two courses only. The only way we have to establish the date of construc- tion of this wall is the presence of a floor in El, cut by a N/S trench parallel to the wall, and with a sewer of the 2nd-lst Ct BC set into it. This floor extends under the peribolos wall and this constitutes a terminus post quem. In squares GI and JK1 the archaeological levels were in place all along the wall but cut into by ancient trenches of the 2nd-lst Ct BC, whose function is not clear. The existence of a breach visible in the W face of the peribolos wall in JK1 is not enough to explain the presence of these trenches. Finally the conduit for drinking water which had been identified by L. Bizard and which runs along the wall was uncovered at several points: a new settling basin was dis- covered in Gl. The date of this installation remains to be defined, especially in relation to the sondages made by Ch. Limas (BCH 1964, 1965 and 1966). It is confirmed that the E area of the temenos of Apollo was for a long time occupied by the lower valley of the Inopos and it was not until the 5th Ct that a building of some size was erected in the E. But it was in the 4th Ct that the area was included in the temenos thanks to some major works (related to the Delian choma) which made the S part usable and enabled the construction of the peribolos wall of the Monument of the Bulls. We have not yet been able to date the construc- tion of the peribolos wall GD26 precisely. We must wait for the study of the (not very abundant) stratified material. But it is probable that this wall had a history more complex than its actual appearance leads one to imagine. It will be necessary to make a precise plan of it and establish what was its state before the modem restoration work." Helene Siard reports on the work done in 1997 on Serapieion C: "During the 1997 season we carried out a photogrammetric survey of the Serapieion C and its immediate surroundings (quarter of the Inopos): aerial photographs of the monument and the area concerned were taken in order to obtain from them, after restoration, a plan. We carried out a cleaning of the sanctuary, and started a catalogue of the architectural blocks stored in the sanctuary: not only the architectural blocks in the strict sense, but also the bases and votive altars and the inscriptions." J.P. Brun and Michble Brunet report on investigation of the perfumery in the stadium quarter area in 1997: "We cleared the complex and dug several test trenches in rooms f and b of house B in the stadium area. Our objective was to establish whether the equipment brought to light in Plassart's excavation in 1912 was that of a perfumery and to define the chronology. But the test trenches also enabled us to distinguish several phases of development of this part of the house, of which only one phase coincides with the use of this room as a perfumery. Phase I (Fig. 145): in the 'ditch' left by the Plassart excavation at the E end of room f our test trenches</page><page sequence="106">106 DAVID BLACKMAN N /.rt -1- 7 i- (i;5- ........... Fig. 145 i. Fig. 146 Ld ~rC I vr IS Fig. 147 brought to light, at the back of the massive foundation of the presses, a wall that had been demolished, which formed an angle with another demolished wall in front of the N wall of the room. Associated with this first phase, preceding the erection of room f and of 2nd Ct BC date, was a little oven. Phase 2 (Fig. 146): at the end of the 2nd Ct or beginning of the 1st Ct a large room of trapezoidal shape was constructed with two alleys bordering its S and E sides. In this room the perfumery was installed (see below) with two presses and four ovens resting on a massive stone foundation. There were two doors into this space, one on the S opening on to the alley, and the other offset in the NE corner of the room. Phase 3 (Fig. 147): towards the middle of the 1st Ct BC the change in use of the room was accompanied by fundamental architectural alterations of the area. The presses and the massive foundations were dismantled and the ditch filled in; the two press-beds were inverted and reused as floor slabs (the report of the excavation of Plassart makes clear that they were found in this position). A large opening divided into three by two piers whose bases survive was pierced in the N wall of the room and a bench was constructed covered with water-tight plaster along the W and S walls, extending the line of the four ovens which were preserved. A small room b was created in the SE corner of this space, with a terracotta lozenge floor. Finally the S alley was incorporated into the private property, its end blocked by the construction of latrines (c) and the access to the room removed by blocking up the door. The functioning of the perfumery: two presses of a different type from those which functioned in the oil-mill of the theatre area at the same period were installed side by side in a huge and solid foundation which was entirely dismantled at the time of the phase 3 alterations and of which only the negative impression remains visible in the stratigraphy. We are dealing, in fact, with wedge-presses (Fig. 148) in which the press-beds of the pressing installation were inserted between two thick vertical posts deeply imbedded in a foundation course carefully built with large blocks. This course is preserved to a height of about 0.50m and contains four holes cut square (? 0.40m) whose sides were covered with mortar doubtless in order to prevent the rotting of the wooden posts embedded in them. The vertical posts were topped by a horizontal beam or fastened into one of the joists of the ceiling in order to ensure the rigidity of the framework. In a slot down one part of the height of the vertical posts were inserted horizontal beams. It was by driving in the wooden wedges from front and back between these beams that pressure was progressively exerted on the press-bed and the oil was extracted, to be collected in a removable basin placed in front of the spout of the press. The oil thus collected in small quantity was used as a base and mixed when hot with perfumed substances; hence the presence of the four ovens near the presses. The restoration of such an installation and its interpretation as a perfumery depend on the iconographic evidence, chiefly four paintings from Pompeii and Herculaneum depicting cupids making perfumes using a press of this type. The excavation of a similar installation in one of the shops of the forum at Paestum dated to the end of the 1st Ct BC also provides interesting points of comparison, notably by the close resem- blance between the Delian press-beds and those of Paestum, which has an identical refined decoration around the spout. Conclusions: the identification of this perfumery must be related to the ancient texts which mention the production of famous perfumes in HL Delos. Besides, it sheds light on the particular features of numerous Delian press-beds: these press- beds designed for the extraction of small quantities of perfumed</page><page sequence="107">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 107 "`:::I?::?-:: ??-??? j &lt; !i:?:::::j::j'I~ Fig. 148 oil from green olives are of reduced size compared with those used for the extraction of oil for consumption. They are the object, furthermore, of particularly careful finishing and their spout was decorated (lateral volutes around a core emphasising the curve of the pouring channel), because these presses were visible in the production area which had, at the same time, to serve as a place of sale. Eight of the twelve press-beds found to date on the city site of Delos have a similar decoration and thus bear witness to an industry of perfume production which was well developed in the HL period." The oil factory of the theatre quarter. In 1997 J-P. Brun and M. Brunet carried out a general clearance and some sondages in houses III O and P in the theatre quarter. They report: "Our purpose was to establish once and for all that the press installations brought to light by the excavations of 1906 were intended for the production of oil and to settle the question of their chronology and understand exactly the way they worked. The sondages were made at five points in the two houses (cf. plan, Fig. 149:) in rooms d and e of III O and in rooms g, h and i of III P. It was rapidly clear to us that old excavations had left intact the fills of the floor of the rooms and had not emptied of their contents the pithoi of the S half of III O d. We, therefore, excavated the bottoms of the pithoi (which were back-filled at the conclusion of the work) and made tests between the pithoi, below the level of the great press-beds of the pressing installations, underneath the paving in front of the press-beds (removed temporarily but replaced in the identical position), as well as in the trench of the counterweight blocks.

House III O was probably built at the beginning of the 5th Ct BC and altered in the 2nd Ct-the time when the neighbouring house III P was built. These two houses were joined together in the first quarter of the 1st Ct BC at the time of the installation of the oil press, which caused a certain number of architectural alterations in house III O, which was converted into a workshop: the elimination of room e in which a massive platform was built for the press-beds of the press (only the southernmost of the two survive); the digging of a well in room f, beddings for six pithoi were dug in the S part of room d and for the basins used to collect the oil under the press-beds. Opposite the two press-beds all along the W wall of the room, two rectangular trenches lined by blocks of gneiss set on edge were arranged to receive the two counterweight blocks. A semi-circular paving of re-used blocks (including a window-ledge) grouted with lime was arranged round the area of the basins. This oil factory functioned for only a short time: the complete vases found broken in several pithoi are identical to the finds of the last phase of the house of the Seals, destroyed in 69 BC. The oil factory, therefore, seems to have been abandoned a short time after this date, towards the middle of the 1st Ct BC. It was certainly an oil factory: the systems of decanting into adjoining basins placed beneath the two press-beds are charac- teristic of the treatment of oil. It seems that the N press-beds (now disappeared or displaced) had been reserved for the extraction of the oil of the first pressing, whilst the more powerful S press, associated with receptacles of a greater</page><page sequence="108">108 DAVID BLACKMAN capacity, was used for the extraction of the oil of the second and third pressing. Numerous carbonized olive stones were found in the pithoi and the chemical analyses of some frag- ments of the walls of these pithoi indicate that they contained oil. We did not, however, find any trace of a trapetum, a mill which is used for crushing olives preliminary to squeezing them in the press and the employment of which seems indis- pensable considering the level of production of the oil press. A sophisticated and costly machine, it was no doubt salvaged after the abandonment of the installation. One of the pithoi was sufficiently well preserved to allow us to estimate its capacity at about 650 litres. The six pithoi of the oilery thus provide a storage capacity of 3,900 litres. A detailed publication of the excavation, the pottery material brought to light and the conclusions arrived at will be pres- ented to the BCH." Paros. New arrangements at the museum are described in ADelt 541; also a serious robbery of 31 ECyc objects. On the Orphanidi and Louki plot at Ag. Panteleemonas in E part of city, outside but near the anc. wall, a 27m stretch of wall was found of two phases: the foundations of an A building surviving to four courses, and above it a LH/R wall reusing earlier sculptural fragments including the body of a kouros and a statue base for a kouros shaped like a Doric column; drainage works in Limenarcheion St revealed inter alia a sarcophagus fragment inscribed HPAKAEIAHE lf2THPXOY and a tomb relief with a funeral banquet. In the necropolis of Paroikia 10 richly furnished LHL/R cist tombs were excavated. At Tholakio (Skiada plot) excavation of the potters' workshops continued, with the discovery of a further kiln, an auxiliary room with door jambs and threshold surviving, a G chamber tomb, a child's chamber tomb of the G period and an isodomic wall, probably A. (ADelt 541-4) Samos. Pythagoreion. The Andeadakis plot was further excavated in 1992 (following work in 1987-88), to reveal more of the large R house: the peristyle of the atrium, the doorway into the triclinium, and the mosaic on its N side (already partly revealed) including a depiction of a Nereid riding a sea-horse, of the late 2nd/early 3rd Ct AD. The mosaic has been removed for conservation. (ADelt 546-7) Thera Akroteri. Ch. Doumas (AS) reports that in 1997 work involved chiefly the conservation of the existing frescos. (Ergon 1997, 63) Perissa (Agia Eirene). A half-ruined double basilica of unspecified date, much damaged in the 1956 earthquakes and by subsequent nearby quarrying, was excavated and cleared in a season reported in ADelt 551-2. The structure, previously virtually buried by subsidence from above, incorporated some walls and four columns from an earlier basilica (late 5th Ct?). The columns preserve fine acanthus capitals. A vaulted ancillary structure was also located but requires further investigation. Spolia, perhaps from the same 5th-Ct basilica, can be found in the large 19th-Ct church of Timiou Stavrou in the same village. (ADelt 552) The Ch. Darzenta plot contained a fine mosaic floor of what appears to have been a LR secular building. Designs were mostly geometric and foliate, but include fish (dolphin?) motifs. Cooking and storage vessels were found along with a much damaged bronze frying-pan in the vicinity of a semi- circular hearth. Of exceptional interest was an inscription carved into a door jamb of one of the rooms in the centre of the complex. The text contained names of some 160 of the estate's slaves, and may be associated with a late 4th Ct census. A list of landed properties on an anc. architectural member re-used in the above-mentioned Timiou Stavrou appears to date from the same period and may be associated with the list of names. This is organised by family, with the eldest mentioned first in each family group and the youngest last. Vaulted chamber tombs (LR?) were also found on the Karamonlengos plot. (ADelt 552-53) DODEKANESE AND AMORGOS Alimnia (see AR 1996-97, 99). D J. Blackman (BSA) reports: "In view of the importance of the site, which seems to have been a naval base for guard-ships of HL Rhodes, underwater investigation has now started in cooperation with the Ephorate of Marine Antiquities, in order to complete the survey already carried out above the surface. A preliminary reconnaissance was carried out in August 1995 with Angeliki Simossi of that Ephorate, and a first season took place in November 1997. In the first season we concentrated on the bay of Emporeio. Search of the sea bed revealed no clear indication of the underwater continuation of the slips on the S side of the bay (before the season was cut short by the arrival of winter storms), but a number of interesting piles of stones and sherds were located mainly towards the N shore of the bay. Analysis of the pottery is not yet complete, but the sequence seems to start in the R period; investigation of the N shore led to our discovery of a major settlement, with wall remains and considerable concentrations of sherds, indicating occupation until the 19th Ct, on the slopes up to the ridge above. This investigation was not pursued since it would have been outside our permit area. On the S shore few remains were found on the slopes above the shipsheds. Excavation of one shipshed was started, but was not completed before the onset of storms." Amorgos Aigiale.

Kardamaina (anc. Alasarna). G. Alevra reports on excavation in the sanctuary of Apollo in 1997: "Excavation continued in 1997 of building F, a LC-EHL temple in the sanctuary of Apollo (Fig. 150). Almost the whole outline of the building was revealed, from the middle step of the krepis downwards, except for a small part of its NE side. Inside the building the other part of the great marble threshold was also found, broken a little beyond its centre, as well as the remaining part of the surviving make-up of the floor, of poros blocks, together with a large part of the rough stone footing on which it rested. Further, it was revealed that the bases of the four pedestals, which had been found outside building F and right against its E side, have a carefully laid level of stones as foundation. Roughly the same depth is reached by this building activity and its destruction in ECh times, as is shown by remains of an ECh house found S of building F." A three-aisle ECh basilica with baptistery, narthex and ancillary buildings was found and investigated. A mosaic floor with geometric motifs was uncovered. Burials date the structure to the 5th-early 6th Ct. An ECh font had been found some 50m away in 1987. (ADelt 682) Serayia. Excavations continued of an A building found under C and HL buildings (AR 1996/97, 99). Two 6th-Ct phases were found well preserved; the earlier contains a monumental building oriented N-S, modified in the later phase. Scattered traces were found of an earlier, 7th-Ct building phase. The large amount of bones found and the discovery of G tombs, partly under the building, indicate a cult use; the main central area would have been a banqueting hall. This unique find deserves further investigation. To the E it is overbuilt by R structures. Limited test trenches below the A levels revealed remains of LBA walls and sporadic PG and G pottery. (ADelt 649-50) Central sector of city. The R phase of the back wall of the W side of the anc. agora was discovered (Odos Peisandrou), behind which was (unexpectedly) the corner of the marble stylobate of a R, probably public, building. The discovery here of a Sward continuation of the anc. agora confirms the suggestion that it extended to the anc. road which passed N of the restored Roman house, and included within it the altar of Dionysos. On Byron and Venizelos Sts the junction of two anc. roads was explored (Svynou plot); they had previously been found to W and N. The N-S road is the first road E of the road along the E side of the anc. agora. Below the foundations of the NW corner of the junction was a deposit of pottery similar to that of a LC workshop deposit on the Tsoha plot (ADelt 46, 488-9), sealed under houses of the new city plan after the Synoikismos of 366 BC. At Gregoriou V and Kleopatras (Kephalianos plot), W of the altar of Dionysos and N of the R house, a spring house was revealed, facing S onto the main E-W road of the HL city. Though the parallels for the exedra type are of R date, the first indications of its date are EHL. Drainage works E of the restored R house, buildings were revealed with mosaic floors and plastered walls; also a R house with courtyard surrounded by a peristyle, the columns and parapet bearing painted plaster. (ADelt 650-4) E sector of city. At the junction of Makrigianni and Eronda (Pantelidis plot) remains of five building phases were found; the earliest two were HL, with a N-S road parallel to that revealed in 1990 to the W (Panormites Monastery property: ADelt 45, 518), and defining the width of the insula between as ca 33m. To the W another anc. street was discovered over 70m, i.e. two insulae, away (Odos Makrigianni, Tsimisiri plot); on the same street (Oikonomidis plot) R building remains with two phases were further investigated, the earlier with cisterns for industrial purposes. (ADelt 654-5) W sector of city. Drainage work by the city council revealed many antiquities. On Bouboulinas was found a well built N-S wall, 5m wide, which was part of the harbour fortification. On Venizelou (Pitsi-Papaconstantinou plot) monumental walls were found belonging clearly to an anc. public building which extended further to S and W. The find is important for the grid of the anc. city, since it seems that from the N side of the anc. gymnasium two public buildings extended, their width corresponding to that of the gymnasium: this building and, to the E, the stadium. (ADelt 655-7) Cemeteries. Marmaroto. A marble altar was found with a warrior relief and a 12-line inscription, reused in the later of two R building phases, and a long stretch of wall of the earlier phase, N of which were tombs of the -1st Ct BC-2nd Ct AD. Several other areas of R tombs were excavated; some had disturbed earlier, HL burials. (ADelt 657-8) Nisyros. Mandraki. At Langadi on the W edge of the village part of an anc. wall was discovered surviving to three courses and for a length of 4.30m. It is very similar to, and may form part of, the anc. fortification wall. (ADelt 647)</page><page sequence="110">110 DAVID BLACKMAN Rhodes Anc. city (W sector). At Cheimarras and Enoplon Dynameon excavation of an insula in the city grid continued (see AR 1995-96, 39; 1996-97, 101). In the S part a wall was found of an early phase of the bath establishment on the N side of street Pl 3. N of this, and S of the S wall of court 3, a monumental wall was found, probably belonging to a stoa of the HL house with mosaics in the SW part of the insula: fragmentary LHL structures and an open area were found N of the W entrance corridor to the complex from Street P26 on the W side of the insula. Study continued of mosaic floors in stoas W and N of court 2; to the E, drains of many periods led into main drain 18. Notable among the finds was a mass of re-used stamped Cor tiles. (ADelt 615-17) Another stretch of the E side of P27, P35 and P39 and the W side of P33 was found, and of the cross-roads P28/P5a and of P8/P38. On Odos Ag. loannou, close to the find-spot of a LHL altar, and remains of a temple and its peribolos, large deposits of ash and bones were found, clearly from burnt sacrifices at the altar, and also many architectural pieces and bases for bronze statutes; the pottery is mainly LHL-R-ECh, but the earliest groups (on the floor or bedrock) were earlier-3rd to 2nd Ct. (ADelt 618) W cemetery. Notable among many finds in 1992 was the important tomb complex on Odos Kazantzaki of the 1st Cts BC-AD, with two rows of tombs on either side of a central space in which were found six altar bases (of poros, for the first time in the cemeteries of Rhodes), traces of burning, and amph- ora necks serving as cippi for drink-offerings. (ADelt 621-3). Central cemetery. Study of the four tomb complexes in the D. Protos plot was completed in 1992 (ADelt 45, 483); notable were complex A (graves of 3rd-2nd Ct and a chamber tomb of Ist Ct BC-AD) and complex B which had a level above ground (unusual for Rhodes), with an altar. A further stretch of the HL period road through the cemetery was found, with 12 levels of paving. (ADelt 623-6) In the Karageorgos plot many of the seven tomb complexes had grave stelai and grave 'tables' (last quarter of 4th-first half of 3rd Ct) and one monumental complex: a Doric stoa. (ADelt 626-7) Construction of the new drainage system made necessary many rescue excavations in the anc. city and fortifications. On Akti Miaouli at Psaropoula, levels of pebbles and sand indicate an earlier sea level in the area (outside and W of the anc. sea wall). (ADelt 627) At the junction of Demokratias and Komnenon remains were found of street P16a and its drain and the main N-S road P38; E-W street P17 was found on Demokratias and further E on Odos Bevin; both sides of N-S street P31 a were found on Demokratias, and a probable section of the C fortification wall, overlain by the HL street. (ADelt 627-30) On Venetokleon was found a stretch of E-W street P18 cut by a house with mosaics of late antiquity, and on Bevin N-S streets P333 and 337 and remains of houses in at least two insulae between them. On Kanada remains were found of street P17 and of HL houses to the N. From the junction of Kanada and Maliaraki to the junction with Avstralias, by Akandia harbour, work continued in the important area where remains of circuit street P40, the HL fortification wall, pre-synoikismos remains and deposits of sherds from a pottery were found in 1991 (AR 1996-97, 100-01). Remains of street P40 were found as far as the S side of the HL wall, and also a monumental bridge across the collecting drain of P40. The HL fortification wall runs E-W and is preserved to two courses in pseudo- isodomic style and seems to rest on a layer of natural sand. Parallel to, and S of this wall, and N of street P40, was a wall probably connected with the earlier, HL phase of the pottery. N of the fortification wall was a pier from a harbour storeroom (similar to those found in 1991). (ADelt 630-5) On Avstralias another stretch of the HL fortification wall was found opposite the EMERY winery, running NE-SW; two courses survive, the lower of stretchers and the upper of headers. From the junction of Byron and Xanthou, as far as Bevin, a stretch of 161m was found of N-S street P34 with 17 paved levels, and its stone-built collecting drain (of HL date). The junction with E-W street P17 was found in the S of the area, but the junction with P16a must lie outside the area to the N. On Makriyianni a drain was found running NW-SE, probably part of the anc. drainage system running out to the E coast. Also a stretch of the HL fortification wall, running N-S and surviving to four courses; outside it to the E were remains of rough constructions which may be harbour installations. (ADelt 635-6) Drainage works also led to excavations in the cemeteries: in the W cemetery 12 rock-cut LHL tombs were found on Pireos, N of the EHL cemetery investigated in 1991 (ADelt 46, 467). In the S cemetery on Anastasiade, where work had taken place in 1990, a built tomb was investigated, disturbed by later burials (early 1st Ct AD): a rock-cut tomb with three skeletons in a lead coffin and a chamber tomb. (ADelt 636-8) Rodini. Excavation was carried out in 1992 in two long narrow stretches along the Rhodes-Lindos road, revealing 16 tombs in one and 80 in the other. The cemetery goes back to the 4th Ct BC; some tombs were apparently cut but never used. (ADelt 639-40) Rhodes town. Continuing investigations of the Med and Ott remains are extensively reported in ADelt for 1992. Only the most important and representative finds are discussed below. Work on Panaitiou St uncovered further traces of successive phases of a Byz path between the main city wall and the outer wall, discovered in the previous season; further remains of this outer wall were also discovered. Excavations of part of the wall built by the Crusading Knights brought to light part of an heraldic plaque of the Grand Master d'Aubusson. The same area included an earlier ECh phase of a structure paved with large clay tiles and marble slabs. (ADelt 670-71) The Karavelatzi plot (K.M. IV 2010 nr. Evraion Martyron square). Despite the poor finds in terms of architectural remains or movable objects, it can be established that this part of the city was originally outside the Byz fortification walls and that Ott occupation wiped out any evidence of previous occupation in the Latin period. (ADelt 671-73) Burials from the period of the Knights were found at various locations in the town, including Agia Aikaterini (Ilk Mihrab) and Agios Artemios, where a sarcophagus was found reused in association with other burials underneath the arco- solium in the NW corner of the church. Burial 17, of a child, was particularly rich in grave goods, including pottery, bronze and lead objects including a small cross and bracelet, and glass fragments. Remains of a gold and silver embroidered veil covered the skull. (ADelt 673-74) Undecorated pottery, lamps and glass objects (blown and hand-made) dating to the 4th-5th Ct were located in some quantity at the Minatsi site on Menekleous St. The N part of the site contained an important assemblage of Crusader glass and ceramic ware, some painted, and two Rhodian denars of the 15th Ct. The lower levels of the site were taken up by the foundations and floors of an ECh structure, much disturbed by later interventions which date up to Ott times. (ADelt 674-75) Byz building remains were identified on the Haliloglou plot</page><page sequence="111">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 111 on Athinas Square. The site has already been identified as containing walls of an ECh basilica (see ADelt 676 n. 20) the N outer wall of which was uncovered in the season under discussion. LR up to Frankish pottery was uncovered along with coins of Maurice, Justinian I and Justin II, Herakleios and Constans II and 13th-15th Ct issues of the Genoese and the Knights of St John. Glassware, lamps and pottery from Attica and Asia Minor were also found, dating from the 3rd to the 6th Ct, and stamped amphora handles of the 3rd/2nd Cts with the inscription 1QKPATEYX on one and EflI TIMOOEOY/ APTAMITIOY on another. (ADelt 675-77) Excavations continued within the church of Agioi Konstan- tinos and Eleni. An anc. floor was found underneath the present floor. A large tomb appears to have been used as an ossuary. Marble fragments, one with a fragmentary inscription, and pottery were found associated with a series of other burials in the N aisle. In the nave, a fragment of a wall-painting depicting the head of Christ in three-quarter pose was found. It is dated to the late 12th/early 13th Ct (now on display in the Palace of the Grand Master). A long list of minor finds is presented, dating from the 12th Ct to the late Frankish period. (ADelt 677-78) Rhodes island. A three-aisled ECh basilica with frag- mentary mosaic floors (geometric motifs) and the foundations of the ambo in the aisle is reported at 'Paliokklisia' in Salakos. The small apse was inscribed within the thickness of the E wall. Another three-aisled basilica (19.80 x 13.80m inside) was located on the Konstantinou site at Soroni. Traces of a mosaic floor and painted wall-decoration were found. The site appears to have had a flourishing settlement thereabouts in the LR period. Yet another ECh basilica and a cemetery were encoun- tered at Trianta at 6 Ag. Paraskevis St: 21 burials, including pithos and cist burials are reported. (ADelt 678-79) Remains of the LR settlement at Kamiros Skala are reported, including the basilica and cemetery.

NNW of the theatre, near the temple of Erethy- mian Apollo, a deposit of LHL amphoras was found, mainly destroyed by building work. (ADelt 644-5) Trianta. At Kavalliero plot two levels of MB date were found, with pottery and a high proportion of loom-weights but no structural remains apart from lumps of clay (cf. the first traces of MB occupation near the E harbour in Rhodes). (ADelt 640-1). Excavation of the S sector of the LB settlement continued. At I. Paraskevas plot walls in Minoan style were found, and a destruction level covered in places by a thin layer of volcanic tephra, and containing typical LBIA/LMIA pottery. The Siatra plot is the southesternmost so far excavated in the LB settle- ment: wells, a layer of tephra and LBIA pottery. (ADelt 641-3) Telendos. In a remote gully on the shore, 1V2 hours walk N of the village, remains of a kiln were found, apparently of LR- ECh date and short duration. (ADelt 647-8) Telos. Ag. Antonios. Another rock-cut tomb was found in 1992, similar to that found in 1990: two graves without grave goods, clearly part of a large cemetery. (ADelt 646-7) CENTRAL CRETE The introduction in ADelt (555), by the then Ephor of Central Crete, Ch. Kritzas, draws attention to the completion in 1992 of the study for the circulation of the over one million visitors a year to the site at Knossos. The proposal of the architect, Clairy Palyvou, has now become a reality under the direction of Alexandra Karetsou and her colleagues at the 23rd Ephorate. The wooden walkways and presentation panels are in place and limited access has been granted to view areas previously off limits. The entrance to the Palace proper by the Corridor of the Procession and along the south front has transformed the visitor's impression of the approach to the building. Work continues in 1998 when further improvements to the site will be seen. Four publications in 1997 are of particular note in relation to Minoan Crete: Jan Driessen and Colin F. Macdonald, The Troubled Island. Late Minoan Crete before and after the Santorini Eruption (Aegaeum 17) Liege 1997; A. Farnoux and J. Driessen (eds.), La Crete Mycinienne.

Investigations under the direction of Prof. Vincenzo La Rosa (Italian School) were concentrated on the re-examination of the necropolis, originally excavated by R. Paribeni (1903) and by F. Halbherr and E. Stefani (1904), including a proper topographic and photographic record of the excavated complexes. The most important results were the following: The tomb of the painted sarcophagus, re-excavated for the fourth time, can be now assigned with precision to an early phase of LM IIIA2 (early decades of the 14th Ct BC), judging by two sherds from cups with traces of black paint, which were found crushed between the foundation blocks of the construc- tion, in the NE corner. The same date can be also applied to the sarcophagus. This particular period, furthermore, corre- sponds to a specific architectural phase at Agia Triada, at the very beginning of the first extensive building program in the settlement, which started with the house 'delle camere decapit- ate'. The tomb itself, entered from the E, measured 3.75/3.80m N-S by 4.10/4.20m on the interior, while the thickness of the walls ranged between 0.90-Im (Fig. 151). :i:::::i:::::i:::::i-:::"~"~"iBiii:il:: ~:-:_:;--i::::::-:::i _-iiiii.iiiP-:i~ii?B iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii':':~?'1.':.: :- iiii-~a~i:ijiii-iii-iiiijii-i.iiil -iiiiiiiiiiiii :. :--:-::? :~i~~?~ i:iiiiiiiiiiiii ii:- ii: ii-i:-i-i- - :::::::::::::::"":: iii::::_::: ,,,,,,-,-,,,in?,?:::i:i :ii ii:: ? : :i i :i i-i-i.:: - : :-::::---::-:::.i g-t:? i?iliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiaiiii iiiiiiiii i:i:i?i?::?i:?-:'-' ?j:~':s ': -'''::::'fii-ii ?i;'i::'?i':'''ii?'i i:iiiii iii:i;% iiii- -::::~ :":?:s ::9:_:::.:. :::':::':::::::::: .-i-i-i-i-i.i :i?iiiji:i.i i;iil:lii-iii j:::::i::::::::: iar--iC*::'-'i~ ---?-i_~i~ _: :: ::::_:~I:_:?i ":i :_i-:::::_-:: :-:::i?::::::i:h;'T--.(~_ : :: : :: : iii?iiii:iii ~ i :_:i-:-::-:ii:::::-,:-_i::-i-i--i-i-:-i: :i::l-~ .'-.;- ... .

The 'ossuary', judging by the pottery found in the wall blocking the entrance, was sealed during the MM II period. The complete excavation of so-called small rooms, S of the large tholos tomb, enabled a first investigation of their architec- ture and layout (within the MM IA-IB periods),' while a further group of tombs was located in the vicinity of the W wall of area 1. The 15 pots discovered, among which were eight conical cups, a shape not attested before in the complex, belong to a developed phase of MM IA and date the abandon- ment of the small rooms (Fig. 152: bridge-spouted jar). Agios loannis (Phaistos). A G tholos tomb and a HL funerary enclosure were excavated in 1993 (Kritiki Estia 5, 334) on a farm SW of the village of Agios loannis, next to the Matala road. The rectangular enclosure surrounded two cist graves, covered with slabs, which had been robbed in antiquity. It lay above the G tholos tomb which had a monolithic doorjamb 1.2m high and a chamber 3.23-3.26m in diameter. The lowest level in the tomb contained G pottery, iron weapons and a figurine, amongst other objects. Chersonesos (Pediada). Harbour and town site: 16 trial trenches revealed remains of an ECh building on the Petridis- Sfakianakis plot. Walls, for the most part destroyed, were of rough stones, tiles and concrete with foundations at 1.40-2.10m below the modern road. Traces of cement and pebble floors were found and finds mostly comprised unpainted pottery and scraps of glass and iron. Fourteen trials on the Velgerakis- Aspetakis property produced yet more ECh walls built of the same materials. A floor of irregular tiling was found with three storage jars beneath it, buried in pits. A circular stone basin came from the W of the plot, on a cement floor. (ADelt 558) Tests on another plot (D. Aspetaki, Odos Sanoudakis-AR 1996-97, 103) revealed HL and R remains, including part of the hypocaust of a bathing complex and a R road built above a destruction deposit. The plot lies in the supposed area of the agora, N of the theatre. Galatas, Pediada. The first stage of investigations at this important site took place between 1992 and 1994 under the auspices of the 23rd Ephorate and with assistance from INSTAP. That the main building of this large settlement is a Palace is clear from its plan: central court with four wings covering four stremmata. Its location at the N end of a rocky hill (Galatiani Kephala) is unusual, although it has a clear view of peak sanctuaries to the N (Mt Juktas), W (Kofinas) and E (Pediada). Three km. to the S is the sacred cave at Arkalochori which functioned at the same time as the palace at Galatas. The central court (37 x 16 m) is orientated N-S with much of its slab paving preserved in situ. The N side of the court is built of large ashlar orthostats (0.80 x 1.70m) set in a tripartite arrangement as at Phaistos. A pillared stoa lies at the NW entrance. Everything points to the N wing being the most important, not least its position facing Juktas and Knossos. A fine stair leads up to the central court between the N and E wings. An area with successive white plaster floors to the left of the entrance to the court is suggested as a place for offerings. By 1994, the E wing had been almost completely excavated, allowing the general history of the building to be reconstructed. It was built in MM IIIA, destroyed by fire within the same period and entirely rebuilt at the MM IIIB/LM IA transition. The original outline of the building with its squared cut blocks was preserved, whilst the internal walls of rough masonry were rebuilt from the floors up. The pathways and central court belong to this rebuilding phase. In LM IA, the original occupants appear to have been replaced by 'squatters' who changed the character of the building by blocking doorways and constructing rough installations in rooms and hallways, including a large fireplace in the pillar room. The final destruction by earthquake, around the time of the eruption of Santorini, found the building in a state of disrepair and virtually abandoned, explaining the scarcity of finds apart from domestic pottery and hundreds of stone querns connected with food preparation. That the building had seen better days is clear from fresco fragments with painted motifs which had been removed from the walls before the final destruction. Painted plaster was also found in the MM IIIA levels, comprising the earliest datable wall-paintings in Crete. Thirty-three deeply cut mason's marks emphasise the palatial character of even the MM IIIA building, and the pottery of that phase is reminiscent of Knossos. The main entrance is in the form of a stoa/propylon approached by two cobbled roadways from the W and E. Inside is a room (6 x 4.70m) with a central column and benches on three sides which had been removed in the final phase to make way for roughly built stone installations. A pillared hall (7 x 7m), reminiscent of that in the Unexplored Mansion at Knossos, lay to the N with plastered walls, clearly the most important room of the wing. Four square pillars surrounded a hearth full of ash, recalling Mycenaean megarons of the 14th Ct BC. Four steps led down into the room from the central court, whilst another door to the N led to a gamma- shaped polythyron. One leg of the polythyron led to a wide corridor linking five storerooms, while the other led to an internal courtyard (8 x 8m) and staircase to the upper storey. A foundation deposit of 20 MM IIIB/LM IA vases was found nearby. (Kritiki Estia 5, 317-22) Gortyn. The Italian School, under the direction of Prof. A. Di Vita, worked in two areas, in the first in collaboration with Mrs A. Karetsou of the 23rd Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities.</page><page sequence="113">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 113 41: :-mb- alli XT"X ~ : 'IFiiii :::, -I AN ?: ~........... Fig. 153 Odeion-agora. In the area of the anc. agora, the NW corner of which had been excavated the year before, was discovered a wall, part of a LMed house, with abundant pottery and coins, dating between the 14th and the 16th Ct AD. Under this wall was located a destruction layer of Byz date and below that a column, on the same line as the plinths in front of the odeion; these lie over the destroyed wall that was probably the back wall of the long N stoa of the HL agora (Fig. 153). A series of sealed floors suggests that the change of use of this wall, from a back wall of the stoa in the HL period to a stylobate, can be dated to the 3rd Ct AD, evidently after a destruction, traces of which have been already identified. The S corner of the stoa, if it existed, should lie further to the E, while the total length of the N stoa was apparently greater than the 74m originally estimated on the basis of the position of the church of Ag. Titos. In the area of the praetorium, excavation was conducted on the E and W sides of the so-called temple of the 'Augusti' and to the S of the great court of the first praetorium, to determine the precise location of the S limits of the building. The temple was built on a high podium, and consisted of a tetrastyle marble pronaos and a brick cella, externally veneered with large poros blocks. A series of stratigraphical trenches on the E side of the temple confirmed the dating of the building in the second half of the 2nd Ct AD. In the 4th Ct AD, perhaps after the earthquake of 365, the area in front of the temple was paved with large slabs, while a little later the corridors provid- ing access from the square to the back of the temple were blocked; Byz tombs were dug in a im thick fill. At the same iiil ii ii i! ................. ;;:ii Fig. 154 time on the W side, a series of pits was dug for the extraction of building material, first for the poros floor of the building and later for the construction of the brick W wall of the cella. At the bottom of the earliest pit was discovered part of a marble drain head from the W side of the temple (Fig. 154). The block, instead of ending in the usual lion's head, ended in a crocodile's head, 0.63m in length, in perfect condition-a unique occurrence, except for two examples of a sea monster found in Italy (Morgantina, Taranto). This amazing find suggests either that the temple was dedicated to Egyptian deities, a widespread phenomenon in this period (2nd Ct AD), or that this piece was dedicated by a person who had close ties with Egypt and wanted to display them. An artificial terrace, designed to compensate for a 3m height difference, was revealed in the SE corner of the great court of the praetorium. To the E, the builders of the first praetorium had used the old city wall as a retaining wall. Of the old fortification system a secondary gate was discovered, preserved to a point above the springing of the arch, in a well- built pseudo-isodomic style; it was probably the part of the city wall which was built by Ptolemy Philopator, at the end of the 3rd Ct BC. Many useful observations were made concerning the re-use of the rooms under the S stoa in the court of the first praetorium, while future excavations will hopefully locate the S limit of the building, which covered a total area of over 10,000m 2. Metropolis. The joint project of the Ephorate of Byz Antiquities under E. Borboudakes and the Italian School under Prof. R. Farioli Campanati, proceeded with the removal of the fallen debris from the central aisle of the large basilica (sectors III-IV) (Fig. 155: from the W). This resulted in the identifica- tion of architectural members to the W of the pulpit, and of many blocks preserving traces of fresco decoration in a style similar to that observed in 1992 on fragments found N of the ambo. The motifs included parallel bands of different colours (red, brown, yellow, white), often decorated with a row of pearls, as well as floral motifs. In the same area were dis- covered marble slabs, part of the second floor, as well as a number of tombs, which were recorded in the pits excavated during the 1994 season, and will be studied next season. Under the accumulated fill were found sporadic slabs, part of the higher floor, and an important fragment of the first mosaic floor, which consisted of large panels along the sides</page><page sequence="114">114 DAVID BLACKMAN Pont :i:!!!!i?,iii!!ii- !: Fig. 155 of a central corridor, framed by a chain of circles, a motif framing the entire decoration of the aisle. The geometric motifs and schematic animal and floral scenes identified were identical to those observed in the past, but they also included impressive additions, which confirm the long life of this phase of the floor. On one panel, in the SW part of the area, to the S of the central corridor, were identified the first letters of a four-line inscription, which by its position, in the beginning of the aisle, seems to have been of a dedicatory character. Herakleion. The sixth season of work in 1992 on the wreck of the French warship La Theirese, sent by Louis XIV in 1669 to the aid of the city besieged by the Turks, is described by M. Anagnostopoulou and N. Lianos in ADelt 700-1. Kastelli (Pediada) (AR 1996-97, 113). G. Rethemiotakis has published an important account of the excavations of the Meidani plot where he has identified the 'central building' of the Minoan settlement ('The Minoan "Central Building" at Kastelli, Pediada' in ADelt 47 (1992) A 29-64, with English summary). Whilst the majority of the destruction pottery of the 2nd Neopalatial phase can be assigned to MM IIIB/LM IA, painted sherds of three or four vessels are submitted as evidence for a LM IB date. A plan of the modem village locates the various building plots where excavations have taken place, including the Kambitakis plot on the E edge of the village, excavation of which was completed in 1992. Old and New Palace period building phases were found here. The first phase was characterised by local Pediada wares of MM IB-II. After the destruction of these buildings, as else- where in the settlement, a building, perhaps apsidal, was constructed with strong foundations, probably in MM IIIA on the basis of a serpentine kantharos paralleled at Syme and, in clay, at Galatas. There were two Neopalatial building phases, one major and one characterised by additions and repairs, covering the whole site. The rooms were small with beaten earth floors and the walls of small rough stones. In two places, wooden roof supports may have existed on top of stone slabs. There was a great deal of the unpainted, local red Pediada pottery. Cult vessels are said to include conical cups, clay stands with a range of relief and stamped decoration, a large fire-box and handmade bovid figurines. A clay mould depicted a wild goat in a rocky landscape. A metal ring had a bezel made-up of two bronze discs and a third of iron, all joined with two silver rivets. The finds are thought to indicate the existence of a neopalatial shrine in the vicinity, perhaps related to a ceremo- nial way which appears to have passed by this area en route to the 'central building'. (ADelt 558-60) Knossos. On the property of M. and N. Sphakianakis, just above the S bank of the Vlychia stream and on the E side of the Herakleion-Viannos road, a 100m2 area is being exca- vated. By 1992 it had revealed remains of a MM IIIB-LM IA house re-used in LM IIIB. The earliest element appears to be a lustral basin within a room (3.90 x 5.40m) on the S, entered through a double doorway. Outside the basin to the W were stone vases and part of a clay bull rhyton of exceptional quality with red, white and black paint. 'Communion' cups of a type found at Kastelli, Pediada were found immediately W of the basin. Gypsum slabs and mason's marks occurred in the walls of both main rooms. The room to the N contained the stone base for a wooden column (traces of burning) and floor slabs of black and green schist. A N-S cobbled road with stone-lined drain on the E of the building is said to belong to the second phase, LM IIIB. Further excavation will clarify details of stratigraphy and date. (ADelt 556) In the upper village of Knossos (Bougada Metochi, Th. Kambourakis plot), a trial excavation (40 m2) found three phases of occupation (LM IIIB-C, MG and HL). G walls were strong but fragmentary due to later wells. Of great importance was the discovery in a LM IIIB-C level of a lentoid steatite sealstone with the representation of a bird goddess, extremely reminiscent of the Zakros clay sealings. Again in Bougada Metochi (H. Babourakis plot) a trial excavation (80 m2) uncovered a system of R drains on the S. These were channels 0.2-0.3m wide covered with tiles and lined with cement. In the SE corner was a much destroyed mosaic floor of white tesserae and tile. Trials on the Aikaterina Vlasaki plot (80 m2) uncovered two LM III walls much destroyed by later R constructions which themselves were very fragmentary; they included walls on a N-S/E-W alignment, a narrow drain covered with tiles and a central drain bordered by two well- built walls and with large clay floor slabs. LM III pottery was found in all the disturbed levels. Of note was a lentoid steatite sealstone showing two scorpions. Just N of the University of Crete (Odos Nathenas, Milt. Skoulas plot), on land which was part of the 'North Cemetery', a badly preserved R cist grave and, a little to the S, two R tile graves were found, the latter containing clay lamps, iron pins and two bronze coins. The Borbori plot, SW of the last remains, yielded 17 R tile graves with very few grave-goods (lamps, glass tear-bottles and coins). Roman Knossos. Mr Gary Forster continued study of principal deposits, with the assistance of students from the University of Birmingham and elsewhere. Most of the material examined comes from the 2nd-3rd Ct debris above the town- house in area C and that from the LR levels in Areas E and F, which appears to be of 3rd-4th Ct date. It provides a useful continuation of the sequence in the area of the Unexplored Mansion which ends in the mid-2nd Ct. Dr J. W. Hayes has continued to give valuable help and support. Stratigraphical Museum Extension Site. Prof. P.M. Warren (BSA) reports on the 1997 season: "The first stage of the programme of conservation and roofing of the major areas of the site was carried out in June- July 1997, with further wall conservation in September. The main work was the removal by excavation of baulks left from the 1978-1982 excavations. This was successfully completed.

Baulks EJ and JK were left, to provide a continuous W side for the main excavated area. The major archaeological results were: (a) completion of the plans and contents of ER houses (FK, KL), including an amphora of the Augustan period; there was also a LHL pithos and part of another to accompany one found in the earlier excavations; (b) clarification that irregular yellow clay levels and lines were decayed remnants of early IA houses, with concomitant grey levels perhaps representing burnt roofing or occupation (QU, PQ/TU/XY); (c) additional LM IIIC walling and much LM IIIC pottery, including finely decorated kraters (awaiting study) (OP, OS); (d) definition of an apparently open air wall built over destroyed LM II buildings, but before the LM IIIA 1 small circular platform which cut the wall (OS); (e) full definition of a burnt staircase area within the LM II south house (MQ); (f) uncovering in KL of the area immediately W of the LM IB kilns (for which AR 1980-81, 75-9 and figs. 6-14), revealing a series of enigmatic pits with fired walls; the pits were clearly part of the kilns system; they were apparently set into accumulated or intro- duced debris in LM IA buildings in trench K; (g) uncovering of its remaining portions to reveal in full the LM I paved road which runs E-W through the site (on line as the westward continuation of the Royal Road NW of the Minoan palace) (FK, KL and a small baulk further E); (h) in testing for possible roof pillar foundations in baulk PQ/TU/XY, a small room containing a substantial LM IA deposit; this deposit is stratigraphically earlier than the LM IA deposit from the closely adjacent trench U (AR 1980-81, 75 and Fig. 156), and it included a piece of pumice. The deposit includes a number of decorated vases, with spirals predominant, plant or reed style and wavy bands (in and out on bowls) well represented, and tortoiseshell ripple present but rare. The potential signifi- cance of the deposit is obvious. Above it was stratified a small deposit, again LM IA, corresponding in level to that in trench U. At the conclusion of the baulk removals in July and in the September period careful backfilling of rooms to near the preserved tops of LM I-II walls and conservation of these walls was carried out to make the site ready for roofing. In addition the temporary roof over the LM IB kilns was removed and replaced by a larger and stronger roof covering the kilns, newly cleaned, and the firepits to the W." Kommos. Joseph and Maria Shaw (ASCS) report on the 1997 season: "During the past year there has been slow but significant progress in our research and manuscript preparation in both North America and Greece, our general aim being to continue to publish the results of excavation carried out during 1976- 1985 and 1991-1994. The year was devoted to completing all fieldwork connected with the publication of the Greek sanctuary, volume IV in the Kommos series. To achieve this aim, Alan Johnston (University College London) refined our understanding of the G and A pottery. Eric Csapo (University of Toronto) completed his chapter on Gr graffiti and inscriptions. M.C. Shaw finished hers on the Gr figurines and other sculpture. In Toronto, Barbara Ibronyi continued the long process of editing parts of this large interrelated volume, which we hope to submit to the publisher in 1998. It will be the most complete publication to date of a Gr sanctuary in Crete. We also focused on the three large M civic buildings which underlie and extend out beyond the Gr sanctuary.

The final, LM IIIA2/B building, may have housed ships of the Mesara fleet. These buildings will be presented and interpreted in volume V. In connection with them, J.W. Shaw wrote the first drafts of the chapters on their architecture and studied miscellaneous finds from within them. In connection with the same volume, J. Rutter (Dartmouth College) revised his text on the LM pottery and foreign imports; and Aleydis Van de Moortel (Bryn Mawr College) began hers on the MM pottery. D. Ruscillo (Institute of Archaeology, London) continued examination of the faunal remains. On the site, excavation consisted of cleaning and a few limited probes. Concerning the first, the remainder of the central court of M Palatial building T was cleared down to court level. The probes were made along the line of the colonnade of the N stoa. Three of the column bases and sub- bases were studied. W of here, in space 10, a sounding was made into earlier MM I/II levels, with the hope of determining whether the N stoa was set in during MM II and was therefore contemporary with the S stoa. In space 7 nearby, scattered ashlar blocks left in situ were removed so that the LM I/II levels could be studied thoroughly: a LM II domestic area with hearth and gourna were exposed in the process. Preceding this work the annual job of clearing growth from the site was carried out. Also, deep sand that had accumulated during the past decade in the NW part of the civic area was removed. After excavation was complete, scarps were consolidated and the perimeter fence was repaired and repainted. While we concentrate on the upcoming Kommos volumes cited above (three, including one in two parts, have now appeared through Princeton University Press), a number of smaller, new studies have either been published or are in process. Among them are 'A LM IA Pottery Kiln at Kommos, Crete', by J.W. Shaw, A. Van de Moortel, P. Day and V. Kilikoglou, in the TEXNH volumes (ed. R. Laffineur and P. Betancourt [1997] 323-330). A considerably longer and more detailed publication about the kiln, which is unique since pottery baked within it was found both within it and in dumps alongside it, is to be submitted to Hesperia in the fall. During May, J.W. Shaw presented a talk in the Rethymnon Sympo- sium on the 'Eastern Mediterranean: Cyprus, Dodecanese, Crete 1500-500 BC'. M.C. Shaw and J.W. Shaw have also written a popular account of Kommos, in Greek, which will be published as a part of the 1996 Mires Symposium-it will also be published separately by the Pitsidia township for general</page><page sequence="116">116 DAVID BLACKMAN distribution. A. Johnston will submit an article on the G pottery from house Z in the Gr sanctuary. Moreover, A. Van de Moortel's long dissertation (Bryn Mawr 1997) on the role that ceramic evidence can play to determine aspects of the econ- omic vicissitudes of the W Mesara (Hagia Triadha, Phaistos, Kommos) will shortly be available through University Micro- films. After prompting by the local Ehorate, a new project is being carried out, namely the preparation of the site for visitors: the site is presently closed to the public. This is a complex and, in its first phases, an expensive undertaking. To help us, James Stratis (Restoration Specialist, Colorado Historical Society) has been designing facilities for visitors: an attractive entrance building with space for guards and sanitary facilities; a circulation plan featuring wooden ramps and paved pathways, as well as elevated platforms from which to view the surround- ings; an extensive roof designed to protect the NW temple area. Drainage, prevention of erosion and sand accumulation through planting, the strengthening of scarps, and the repoint- ing of walls are also being considered. We are particularly grateful for advice in such matters to Dr Clairy Palyvou, architect and expert in site conservation and management, also to Martin Schmid, architect of the French School. The general goal, shared by excavators, local community, and the Archae- ological Service, is that the Kommos area should become an 'archaeological park' without major construction and accessible to the local inhabitants and foreigners visiting the antiquities and/or the beach. For this reason we will probably propose that the parking area be located at some distance from the site, like that at nearby Phaistos. S of the site, on land about to be expropriated, there will be a large planted area provided with a facility for refreshments and sanitary facilities. In the meantime the Greek State will probably soon announce that much of the area from the modem highway, far E of the site, westward to the shoreline, is an 'Alpha Zone', where no building can take place. Still in the future are the publication of The Greek Sanctu- ary (by 2000?) and The Minoan Civic Center (by 2002?). We are also in the first phases of research for a monograph on LM house X, rich in architecture, pottery, wall paintings and other materials. The result, combined with the volumes already available, will be an unusually thorough, full-spectrum, interdisciplinary study of a M and Gr site by the original excavators, not a common event. The long-term improvement of the site may begin during the same period. Until our upcoming publication commitments are provided for, we do not intend to reopen excavations, even though rich civic and domestic areas remain unexplored." Kounavi (Pediada). An A stone plaque with inscriptions is reported from here as well as G and R pottery. Remains of the Gr-R city in the area are identified with anc. Eltyna or Eltynia. Chance finds and buildings of different periods (G, A, HL-R) confirm its importance. Of particular note was the 1967 discovery of an early C funerary relief of a female figure holding a wreath and a flower. Two cemeteries of G and R date have been investigated. The G cemetery (on the property of D. Eleutheraki) had two tomb types: pit graves and chamber tombs with dromoi. Both inhumations and cremations in urns were accompanied by vases, iron weapons, bronze fibulae and simple jewellery. A pyre at the entrance to a chamber tomb and a built hearth are related to funeral rites. A tholos tomb of the 9th-8th Cts BC was well built with a slab floor and porous limestone door frame closed by a single large slab found in situ. This is unique for the period in N central Crete and the accompanying pottery indicates Knossian links; obeloi and iron weapons were also found. The R cemetery (property of Chr. Chronakis) is a series of rock-cut tombs covered with stone slabs. Glass vessels, bone and bronze pins and coins were amongst the 2nd-Ct AD finds. (Kritiki Estia 5, 315-17) Lenta (Lebena). Rescue excavations in the NW part of the settlement, some 50m SE of the sanctuary of Asklepios, revealed parts of walls as well as two inside areas with beaten earth floors, all belonging to the R settlement. The walls were up to 1.5m high and constructed of rubble and cement; 2nd-Ct BC coins and lamps are mentioned. (ADelt 560) Moni Odigitrias. In 1994 urgent excavations took place at the much looted prepalatial cemetery at 'Ston Skaniari to Lakko'. In the S complex, the tholos tomb and two adjoining rectangu- lar burial buildings with more than two rooms of burials and offerings were excavated, while a third remained undug. The N burial building comprised five rooms for burials, one for offerings and another for storage. (Kritiki Estia 5, 336-7) Syme Viannou. A. Lembese (AS) has now completed excava- tion of the Sanctuary of Hermes and Aphrodite. During the conservation/restoration of the extant architectural remains, a small one-room church was discovered, with a later church inside it; both churches date from the 4th-6th Ct AD. W of the two churches was located part of a stepped, paved ascent, the continuation of the Neopalatial processional road; a large part of the road had been earlier uncovered to the S. This new section too, running NW, was lined with retaining walls and drainage channels for the rainwater. Similar roads connected buildings U and V during the Old Palace period. During restoration work in the HL-R building C-D, small votive offerings, stone ritual objects and tile fragments were found, built into the walls; they came from earlier levels of the sanctuary. Worth mentioning is a bronze seated male figurine, part of a four-sided lebes, which the excavator thinks Cretan work under Cypriot influence. (Ergon 1997, 67-70) Tripiti. After a great deal of destruction in the wake of modern illegal building, the historic-as opposed to M-settlement of Tripiti was investigated in 1992. Two rectangular rooms belonging to an extensive building of at least five rooms were excavated. Walls, preserved to a height of 1.5m, were made of partly worked limestone covered with yellowish white plaster. Cor tiles covered the roof, many of which were found smashed but complete on the beaten earth floor beneath fallen wall debris. The building can be dated to between 100 BC and 100 AD. Beneath the floor was an oblique wall and a foundation deposit with a pot containing animal bones, charcoal and ash. Inside the rooms were built platforms in the corners and niches in the walls, as well as once a wooden bench along the N side of both rooms. Numerous caprid horncores are noted. (ADelt 560-1) Excavation of a HL building at Phylaka, SE of the MM settlement took place in 1993. Most of the other HL buildings had been destroyed in 1983 and 1989. A central room (of three) was lined with benches and had four pillars to support the upper storey. A pithos was found in situ and the pottery indicates a 3rd and 2nd-Ct BC date for the building.

These do not appear to be Cretan forms of names and KX1ty- EVE0g recalls a Rhodian family (KhytvEtot). (ADelt 602) Agios Nikolaos, Merambellos. Four tombs were found on the Ladithiotakis property (Odos Plastiras) where one of the two great HL/R cemeteries of ancient Lato is situated. One was a tile grave and all were cut into the soft kouskouras bedrock. Thirty-four tombs were found on another property (Chorophas) on Plastiras, mostly pit graves but including some tile graves. Many of the finds are listed in ADelt 602. Skeletal evidence was poor and only tomb 25 was undamaged. A R tile grave was found on the D. Kakoulakis property in the same street, while a double cist grave and two tile graves were uncovered on the Sophia Kritsotaki property in Odos Lato. (ADelt 601) Chrysokamino. Philip P. Betancourt (ASCS) reports on the 1997 season of excavations: "A total of four areas were investigated this season: area XA, the metallurgy location; area XB, the habitation location; area XG, the rock shelter near the habitation location, where a single trench was opened; and area XD, an agricultural terrace adjacent to the rock shelter, where another trench was also dug. Area XA, the metallurgy location: Only three trenches were opened at the metallurgy location this season. No additional architecture or relevant finds were recovered and the site was completed during the first week of the season. Area XB, the habitation location: this year, trenches were opened to the N, S, E and W of the trenches opened last season. For the most part, these new trenches were contiguous or adjacent to one another. The only exceptions were trenches XB-38 and XB-39, opened along the northernmost wall visible prior to excavations. The goal of this season was to determine the full extent of this site in the LM III period, to come to a better understanding of the earlier, LM I remains on the W, and to reveal the range of activities performed at the location during the M period. This final objective will require several years of study after the conclusion of excavation. A final goal for the year was to determine the extent of damage done to the BA architectural remains during the creation of the mod. mandra. The majority of the habitation location site was characterised by very shallow strata, sometimes no more than 10-15cm above bedrock, so it was possible to complete many trenches in only two years. Altogether 49 trenches were dug which vary in shape and size according to topographical or architectural limitations or factors. The absence, in several instances, of the continuation of walls indicated the high degree to which this site was robbed out by the later builders of the mod. mandra immediately to the S. During the excavation of several trenches to the S it became necessary to dismantle part of this mod. structure which local people assured us was no longer utilized. Many of the BA walls revealed are preserved only to the height of one or two courses of stones. Several distinct building phases were discerned following a study of wall sequences and pottery. The earliest architectural remains at the location are LM I, a phase restricted, architecturally, to the W part of the site. Two to three phases of LM IIIA date suc- ceeded this LM I phase. The latest date for the architecture at this location is LM liIA: 2 (late)--LM IIIB. Generally, the LM I wall construction was characterized by the utilization of bedrock as a solid bedding for walls. The later, LM IIIA walls, however, were most often seated atop soil or a packing of soil and cobbles and soil, often to level the irregular bedrock at the site. Very few of the building stones on the site appeared to have been shaped. In the LM IIIA period this stone and soil packing was also used to level surfaces to be used as interior or exterior space. Sometimes these surfaces were then paved with small phyllite slabs where the bedrock did not project upwards. An example of a paved, interior space can be seen in trenches XB-le, XB-8, XB-16, XB-4w, XB-6, and XB-42 (in the S part). Examples of exterior paving occur in trenches XB-7, XB-5, and XB-46. Most of these floors were preserved only as a few slabs found lying horizontally in rooms or spaces. The technique employed for wall construction on the site, in general, was that of rubble masonry construction in which small to large stones were used in conjunction with a packing of soil. The creation of terrace walls was done both to hold back soil and stones to level areas and to provide a foundation for building walls and surfaces. This practice, along with the use of stone and soil packing in crevices in bedrock, was especially typical of the construction techniques employed at Chrysokamino during the LM IIIA period. Also common in LM IIIA was the building of walls atop soil rather than bedrock. Built architectural features in the site included two hearths discovered in trenches XB-14 and XB-28. Several additional built features were found this year in adjacent trenches XB-13, XB-23, and XB-32, but their exact function has not yet been determined. The earliest ceramic material recovered at the Habitation Location was Final N in date. This evidence included sherds from several large, carinated and handled jars in a coarse fabric that was burnished. EM pottery was found as well, in limited quantity, mostly from trenches XB-16, XB-38, and XB-43. A greater quantity of MM sherds were found, but, still, there were no traces of any MM architecture at the site. Thus, while we cannot insist that EM or MM buildings once stood on the site, the likelihood that they did exist in the general area is high. In the LM I period at least one building stood on the W part of the site. Part of this structure was uncovered below the final phase (LM IIIA: 2) building. At least one, if not two, intermediate, LM IIIA phases were also indicated. Thus, the sequence of occupation in LM IIIA is as follows: phase I: proved by the elevation of a LM IIIA deposit on a floor re- using LM I walls in trenches XB-8e and XB-3e (NE corner); phase II: proved by a built hearth in trench XB-3w; phase III: proved by the placement and elevation of a wall which was laid atop the hearth and appears to correspond to the building of the doorway of the final phase structure in trench XB-3e. Neither the S limits nor the E extent of the site in LM IIIA can be found, due apparently to the later robbing out of the walls. The majority of the pottery from the site was LM IIIA in date. The range of vessel shapes represented in fine ware included: cups, handled bowls, kylikes, stirrup jars, jugs, and other closed vessels. In addition, many sherds of both cooking class and storage class vessels, in tempered fabrics, were recovered. In future seasons, an emphasis will be placed on discerning the various coarse fabrics used in the LM IIIA period." Gournia. L.V. Watrous (ASCS) reports on the 1997 study season: "This June and July the Gournia Project completed the fieldwork associated with the Gournia Survey carried out in</page><page sequence="118">118 DAVID BLACKMAN 1992-1994. Harriet Blitzer finished her research into traditional agriculture and land use in the Isthmus of lerapetra. She also oversaw completion of the drawing of the Med-Ott period pottery. L.V. Watrous revisited many of the sites discovered by the Survey in order to take photographs for publication. He super- vised the drawing of a state plan of Harriet Boyd's Shore House and aerial photographs of the Gournia coastline taken by Jan Driessen. In addition, the chapter manuscript on the register of sites was typed into the computer. Finally, he oversaw the transportation of the finds from the Survey into the East Cretan Center." Gra Lygia, lerapetra. At Arapi Skala (Phrantzolakis farm), two chamber tombs were dug and a small but unsuccessful survey carried out to locate the settlement to which they belonged. Chamber tomb I was of the usual type with an elliptical chamber (diam. 2.10m) and a doorway with a drystone blocking above a large stone threshold. The dromos had been destroyed. Two sarcophagi contained skeletons with vases around them, although these had been brought to the museum by the farmer on discovery. Three large kraters, a jug and two stirrup-jars lay outside the sarcophagi. Fragments of another sarcophagus, presumably belonging to an earlier burial, were amongst the blocking stones. Date: LM III A-B. Tomb II contained one painted sarcophagus with a bowl and the skeleton inside and other vases roundabout. Traces of an older burial were found. Date: LM III A-B. (ADelt 602-4) Itanos. The French School reports on the 1997 season: "Work was carried out on several different sites. The excavation at basilica A was centred on the area N of the church in order to examine the relation of the monument to its surrounding area and the approach to it. The examination brought to light new sections of parallel walls of the N exterior wall of the basilica, between which was a narrow pathway (width from 1.15 m to 2.25 m). A section of an open conduit built of tiles and small stones was also found. In 1997 we proceeded to extend the excavation both to the N (sector VII) in order to recover stratigraphic information, and to the W (sectors VIII-IX) in order to confirm the main occupation phases in this habitation area: Phase 1: Houses of the Byz period (5th-7th Cts AD) in two groups separated by an E-W axial road which was later blocked at its E end. To the W extended an open area charac- terized by the presence of a well and the absence of other remains of walls. Phase II: No new element was discovered during this campaign. The most outstanding feature remains the reuse of structures of this phase in the construction of groups of houses of a slightly later date (since phase II could still be dated to the 5th Ct AD). Phase IlIa: Characterized by a drain on a N-S alignment, connected with an open space along the side of a building of which we know only the W and N ends. Phase IIIb: The most important element of this phase consists of a major N-S road (4m wide) lined on the E by a row of sandstone blocks and on the W by a krepis also built of sandstone blocks which at the same period lines a large open area with a beaten earth floor. Phase IV: In area IV we brought to light a pebble floor which could be connected with a feature of the same kind in the next room to the S. We thus confirmed the existence of an open space (?roadway) under the buildings of the R period. Other structures belonging to this phase were unearthed further to the W where two perpendicular walls were on an alignment totally different from that of the other structures in this sector. The layer which covered this building after its abandonment dates from the 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD. As an extension of our work in 1996 we went on in 1997 to excavate the area inside and E of the perimeter of the N necropolis called the 'big Tomb' (grand tombeau). We were able to reveal some 25 burials, bringing to 40 the number of tombs unearthed up to now in the area. The intensity of occupation of this necropolis seems to be extremely high and several phases seem to be revealed: (a) The G necropolis has left only very few traces; at the most a few oval hollows can be attributed to it. (b) A cemetery of the C period can be better defined even through none of these tombs is intact. One of the C tombs cut into by later constructions contained the skeleton of a young girl wearing a pair of gold earrings and an iron ring on her left hand. This tomb also contained a small amphora doubtless of the 4th Ct BC on which traces of two pieces of material still appear in negative. This cemetery was probably used at least into the first half of the 3rd Ct BC. (c) It is certainly in the 2nd Ct BC that a relatively import- ant reorganization occurred which disregarded previous burials (doubtless after a destruction or abandonment) while retaining approximately the same burial alignment and reusing some of the materials of the previous cemetery. This necropolis was probably in use until the turn of the 1st Ct BC to 1st Ct AD. This last phase of use of the necropolis was systematically robbed and its building materials taken for reuse in a period still unknown. Only the grave goods found in the destruction level and, rarely, one or two funerary vases left intact in the tombs provide any dating evidence. To the W of this perimeter we tried to define the general topography of the necropolis. We thus revealed the boundaries of the HL necropolis and partially unearthed an area occupied in the A period and preserved thereafter. At least two phases of destruction/abandonment seem to characterize the N necropolis (one between the end of the 6th Ct and the 4th Ct BC and the other in the course of the first half of the 2nd Ct BC), before its final abandonment doubtless at the beginning of the Imperial period. In order to define the chronology of the rampart con- structed on the big hill S of the city we carried out three sondages on the SW tower which still retained a block with angular chiselling of HL type, of which a rapid survey of the area produced other examples. It was apparent that the tower is perfectly bonded with the curtain walls of the rampart and that the whole entity belonged to a single construction phase. This probably goes back to the establishment of the Lagid garrison at Itanos, but the excavation did not allow us to be more precise. In addition to several cleaning operations which allowed us to define the topographical details of the rampart, we also noted the traces of two roads leading to the fortifica- tion, one by working along its S side, and the other by following, from below, the W curtain. Geophysical prospection: the Polytechnic Institute of Crete carried out geophysical research in different parts of the city. It was essentially interested in demonstrating the existence of archaeological structures in the area between the two acropoleis of the town, and in the N part of the city where a quick sounding brought to light two parallel walls which had been discovered by geophysical research in 1996. Besides this the Polytechnic team continued its work on the geological evol- ution of the terrain in order to define its configuration in antiquity. The main methods used were geomagnetic, electro- magnetic, seismic and geoelectric." Kavousi. Geraldine C. Gesell (ASCS) reports on the 1997 season: "All the material, artifactual and non-artifactual, was moved from the temporary work and storage space in Pacheia Ammos</page><page sequence="119">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 119 and the Wiener Laboratory at the ASCS to storage space in the new INSTAP Study Center for E Crete. Progress in the study of the artifactual and non-artifactual material from both sites, Kastro and Vronda, continued to be made. Study of the Kastro material concentrated on the floors of rooms 35 and 36 on the W Slope where stratified floor levels dating from LM IIIC through O can be identified. The large deposits of pottery from LG remodelling fill levels in this same area were also examined and written up. Study of the Vronda material from the LM IIIC buildings C, D, and E was completed. The study of the EM and MM deposits beneath the floors of building E was also finished. Work on pottery from building A/B continued; the large terracotta window frame from building B was restored and conserved. Floor deposits from building I were also further examined. Study of the context pottery from building G (the Shrine) and surrounding areas was completed, revealing the complex history of the area. More of the clay statues and ritual equipment were con- served and restored. Large parts of six more statues including five skirts, one fine head, and two arms with preserved fingers and one more snake tube have been put together, drawn, and photographed to facilitate their study. The examination and restoration of the pottery from the LG cremation cemetery was completed with the study of graves 7, 15, 23, 30, 33, and 34 in the W area of Vronda and graves 19, 25, 26, 27, and 32 in the area of the Vronda Shrine. Scientific studies continue on the material. More sherds were chosen for petrological testing; the identification of the shells was completed; pottery contexts for more areas are now available to those studying the bones, stones, and shells so that they can continue their interpretive studies." Meseleri, lerapetra. A LG cemetery of pithos burials was discovered at the site of Petros Phrameno. Most burials had one or two pithoi, on their sides in hollows in the bedrock and stabilised with small stones. At least one pithos contained three burials and the dead were normally placed with head towards the base. More details of the 12 tombs are in ADelt 604-5. Mochlos. Jeff Soles (ASCS) reports: "In June 1997 we closed the apotheke in Mochlos and moved all finds from the 1989-1994 Greek-American excava- tions up to the new INSTAP Study Center in Pachyammos. We spent the 1997 season in two activities: a study season which focused on the second of five projected volumes reporting on the excavations conducted from 1989 to 1994, and the consoli- dation and conservation of buildings excavated on the island of Mochlos in the excavations of 1908 and 1989-1994. This last summer we began preparation of the second vol- ume in the Mochlos publication series: Volume III, Mochlos Period IV: Mycenaean Settlement and Cemetery. We finished the first volume, Volume II, Part 1, Mochlos Period III: Neopalatial Settlement on the Coast, with the exception of the paleobotany report. Soles and C. Davaras are the editors of the publication series, but each volume is a collaborative publica- tion which involves the work of many other scholars as well. Site consolidation work focused on two areas on the island of Mochlos: the Prepalatial cemetery and the Neopalatial settlement in block B. 1, both excavated by R. Seager in 1908. These were the areas where the need was greatest, and a much smaller amount of work was done in areas uncovered in the recent excavations. Bushes were cleared away, walls in danger of collapse were consolidated with cement, while others which still preserved their earth bonding were capped." Palaikastro. Hugh Sackett (BSA) reports on the 1997 study season: "Study took place at the Ayios Antonios research centre in April and June-October. The centre has been improved with the addition of a library, courtesy of Dr J. A. MacGillivray. Priorities were set for final publication: the first in a series of monographs is to be devoted to the chryselephantine statuette, with some 10 contributors. Most of the outstanding earth samples were water-sieved by Dr A. Sarpaki and a programme for the final study of the environmental material begun. Progress was made on mending and drawing the rich MM IIIB deposit from building 6 by P. Murray and N. Karanikolas. Dr R. D. G. Evely devoted much of the winter and spring to the small finds from building I and from the other excavated areas. Dr E. Hatzaki studied the pottery from well 576. A study of the whole site was submitted by the landscape architect Ms Marina Adams. Site conservation is an ever- present and pressing need." Petras, Siteia. A detailed account of the 1994 excavations of this now well-known site appears in Kritiki Estia 5, 344-358, including a stone-by-stone phase plan. This expands greatly on the entry in AR 1994-95, 69-70. Praisos. In 1997 study continued in August and September under the direction of Dr James Whitley of material picked up in the 1993 and 1994 survey seasons of the Praisos project. He reports: "As in 1996, work concentrated on material picked up in the 'urban survey' of Praisos itself in 1994. We have continued to refine our techniques of study, principally our use of the Paradox relational database and our technique of strewing by fabrics begun at the end of the last study season. Our intention, then as now, was to be able to use a range of fabrics (what Jennifer Moody calls a 'fabric suite') to date the occupation of certain sectors of the city. So far, the technique of 'fabric strewing', though imprecise, has tended to confirm more traditional, stylistic forms of dating surface material. The paradox database have helped us to show the distribution of fabrics by area (tract or terrace), and to allow for geomorphological biases in the distribution of sherds. Early results from our study have been encouraging. Some fabrics do seem to be datable, and there is a surprisingly dense concentra- tion of early material (that is material dating to LMIIIC, PG, G through to EO) on the E side of the First Acropolis. Strew- ing last year revealed much early material existed also on the W side, and these results suggests that Praisos was indeed a settlement of considerable size from a very early date." Vasilike lerapetras. A. Zoes reports on the 1994 season in PAE 1994, 173-223. It was the culmination of 25 years of systematic research and 16 seasons of excavations at the site of Vasilike (1969-1982, 1989-1994), which involved not only the detailed study of the site itself, but wider problems of Minoan archaeology in general. Five volumes of the Vasilike publica- tion are in the final stages of preparation, including 24 cd-Rom discs with 2,400 photographs, plans, sections, etc. The study of selected material from the old and new excavations resulted in the discovery of five Koumasa style sherds decorated wih dolphins, a unique occurrence, which is attested again later, in the LM I Marine style, both on vase painting and fresco decoration. The same sherds confirm the use of a type of many- faceted cylindrical stone tool, found in the excavations, as a kind of spatula, for rubbing, polishing, or</page><page sequence="120">120 DAVID BLACKMAN smoothing pottery, as well as the use of actual sea shells as polishers. The detailed study of various groups of finds, including pottery, spindle-whorls and mill-stones, led to research on various everyday activities in the settlement, like pottery- making (use of hard clay cores for making handles and figurines), wool-working, the grinding of grain, etc. Finally, the last study season included the study of large groups of small finds, as well as pottery. Excavation proceeded with the opening of a considerable number of trenches for the clarification of the history of the settlement. Below the great court two architectural phases were identified in the artificial fill, laid down as the foundation of a substantial building of the start of the MM period. Only a small part of the plastered floor and a small section of a plas- tered wall of that building are preserved at the top of the hill. Further investigations of the court itself date it to the Vasilike I phase and suggest that it was designed as a village square, for communal use, and not as a palace court. At the same time it was possible to record the precise paving methods employed, including the foundation of the paving stones on a layer of hard wet clay (white kouskouras) and the invisible placing of gravel in the joints between slabs, for a tighter fit. Test trenches at other points of the site confirmed the LMI date of house 50, which was until now thought to be part of the earlier MM building at the top of the hill, and revealed the existence of a small bench and a wall in room 5, 20-40cm below the level of the central court. It also seems that the W house was founded directly on the paving of the great court and dates to the Vasilike period. In the area of house F, it was clarified that building 443 and pavement x-F6 belong to the Koumasa phase, paving n-44 dates to the Vasilike phase, while house F, one of the most important private dwellings in the site, was built in the EMM period. Over the destruction layer of house F was erected the LM I house N. It is worth noting that at Vasilike remains are preserved of seven EMM houses. Finally, it seems that room 43 was part of house F and not of the Red House, as had been believed. A fresh investigation of house K, of the EMM period, part of the E sector of the anc. settlement, helped clarify its plan, which consisted of 7-8 areas on either side of a main wall running N-S, while a second substantial wall crossed it with an E-W orientation. Although the old excavation obliterated most traces of floors, the discovery of an in situ stone basin (room 02) and of a monolithic threshold block, unique at Vasilike (L: 96cm; W: 53cm), are probably safe indicators of the original floor level. The foundation system of the house includes the use of larger stones and wet clay fill in the E part, where the slope was greater, while in the W part the fill was generally looser. Finally, the building in area 1 _ -P (PA0, PAS) was dated in the EMM period. Further work with the semicircular construction and the so- called baetyl, on pavement PBac, confirmed that the structure is Minoan in date. The 'baetyl' stone itself seems to have had two alternative positions: a horizontal position, as it was found, and a vertical one, judging by the special socket on the top of the semicircular construction. Whether it was really a baetyl, with religious associations, is a matter to be discussed further. Investigations were also conducted along the W coast of mod. lerapetra, concerning the R city, an important port of those times, including the remains of the R harbour wall (preserved L: 186m) and the collection of a great number of portable finds, especially pottery and marble floor fragments. Vrokastro. Barbara Hayden and Jennifer Moody (ASCS) report on the 1997 study season: "During June the 96 boxes of Vrokastro pottery were moved into the Research Center in Pacheia Ammos, and the sacks of sherds rearranged. The earliest sherds from sites that may be of final N through EM II were re-examined: they were counted from each site, the various fabrics were described and munsells were taken, in preparation for an article by Hayden on the earliest phases of settlement within the Vrokastro area." Zakros. L. Platon (AS) in 1997 continued the conservation and study of the finds, especially from the Old Palace complex below the NE wing of the palace, from house A on the NE hill and from the E building.

Excavation of the 'watch-tower of the sea' was completed, indicating a building of two phases, the construc- tion of the tower and terrace belonging to the beginning of MM II. Occupation of two rooms in LM III was noted as well as the existence of a LM I floor in room 3. Tragopiastis, Epano Zakros. Two tests in 1992 were meant to determine whether the M building here was a watch-tower. This remained unclear. Surface survey in the areas of Zakros, Ziros, Xerokampos and Hohlakies located a large number of sites (AR 1994-95, 64; ApXatokoyta 43 (1993) 70-78). Of particular note was the concentration of 'villas' in the broader Zakros area at Viglia Xerokampos, Melepha and Vaklias Zakros. Five more towers were found, traces of roads, quarries and industrial installations. (Kritiki Estia, 5, 359-66) WESTERN CRETE Agia Photini, Amari. Ancient walls were located on the Zambetakis plot S of the acropolis of Sybritos. Two rooms, a drainage system, a paved floor, three outdoor areas and a tomb were discovered. The architectural remains belong between the late 4th to 2nd Cts BC. The burial was made in a rectangle of cut stones covered with six slabs. Four R vases were found with a bone pin. NW of the tomb was a thin destruction layer with HL and R pottery including a Megarian bowl depicting a human figure, and a krater. (ADelt 596-9; Kritiki Estia 5, 302-6) Agios Georgios, Rethymno. Traces of an ancient installation were found at Ai-Lias where ancient terracing is accompanied by C and HL pottery as well as M. (Kritiki Estia 5, 250) Ayios Vasilios Valley Survey. The 1997 third field season completed the fieldwork for the Survey, directed by Jennifer Moody, Alan Peatfield and Stavroula Markoulaki. They report: "The first season in 1991 had located scatters of archae- ological material in the valley during transect walking. In 1994 locations in the SSE section were revisited and studied in detail. The goal of the 1997 season was to revisit the remaining locations in the rest of the Survey area. As in 1994, we concentrated on locations that might have a BA phase, and we recorded detailed information about each location if we either found BA material or deemed it worthwhile for other reasons (a particularly good example of another period, a single period site, etc.). We were especially concerned to collect systematic samples of material from each location for future study. The full team worked a total of 41 days in the field and managed to revisit 141 scatters, and impressive average of 3+</page><page sequence="121">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 121 scatters per day. 67 scatters proved worthy of detailed record- ing. Of these, 17 scatters were not revisited; we were prevented from revisiting 8 locations by uncooperative landowners. Because of time constraints the collected material was only cursorily studied before it was packed away. Therefore sugges- tions within this report regarding site date and function are tentative. Another disclaimer is one we have repeated every year. The region studied has been strongly (but patchily) eroded and has poor visibility, making it difficult to tell just how much of the picture we are actually recovering; there has also been an inordinate amount of bulldozing. Further, two hostile landowners (one with a gun, the other with un-leashed dogs) prevented the examination of locations in two key areas. This season's data do not contradict any of our previous suggestions regarding the settlement pattern. EM material is still rare and best preserved on hard limestone (as are most sites), MM settlement is still nucleated, and LM settlement is still hierarchical and dispersed. Although we identified more Gr period sites than expected, the Ayios Vasilios valley still has not revealed a large citadel comparable to Sybrita in the Amari valley immediately to the E. The obsidian count for the Survey area was more than doubled by the discovery of the site of 'Kastella Koule' above Palaioloutra (4926#13 datum 2). Unfortunately, the site has been totally levelled by bulldozing. We have noted before that obsidian seems to go with sites that date to EM/MM I (see 1994 report). Crushed remains of characteristic burnished and Calc ware sherds at 'Kastella Koule' suggest that this locale is no exception. Animalfigurine fragments were recognized at four sites. The first ('Khalepa' 5225#9) is a large multi-roomed structure of LM III. The second, Sarazina (5224#11, 12, 13), is MM II to LM I, and has produced a large amount of cup fragments, some of which may be local Kamares Ware. The third, Katsogridha (5025#7), has a concentrated deposit of well- preserved LM III pottery: it seems likely that this deposit is all that remains of an LM III burial. The fourth, Pezoulo (5024#5) is an extremely complex site, focused around several huge fallen boulders, each the size of a 3-4 storied building, located on the E side of the ravine that is immediately E of Astipadhes village. There is a magnificent view of the Astipadhes Korakias peak sanctuary from the top of the boulders that could never have been obscured by vegetation. The material seems to be mostly LM I, but some could be earlier. The toponym 'Pezoulo' was noted by Hood and Warren in 1965 as the location of LM III pithos burials excavated by Petroulakis in 1912 and 1913. We searched for this site in 1991 and tentatively concluded that it was located in the vicinity of a stone enclosure above the dirt road that leads from Astipadhes village to the peak sanctuary. This year we revisited the general area where we thought the burials might be. Our efforts were richly rewarded: in the well-kept fieldhouse complex immediately above the road we found parts of three jar burials probably dating to LM IIIC or EIA. Another significant location is a cave site (5226#1) which probably was more than just a shepherd's mandra in antiquity. Sediment depth in the cave seems to be good and could preserve ancient material. One site was revisited at the request of the local Archaeological Service, to inspect the trench of an irrigation pipeline, which had been installed some months before we arrived. At the E end of the trench we found the fragmented remains of two pithoi (1 LM, 1 Gr?), many freshly broken sherds, and human bone fragments. At the W end of the trench were several fragments of a mosaic floor (the tesserae include pottery fragments suggesting an EByz date), large blocks of dressed stone, and roof tiles. Unfortunately this material was hastily reburied by the contractors before it could be collected. It seems likely that the material at the E end of the trench belonged to LM III and later burials. The site changes character to the W where there seems to be a substan- tial Byz building. Future work: in June and July 1998 the team plan to study the finds now collected and stored in the Rethymnon Museum, proposing to complete the study by the year 2000." Alpha, Mylopotamos (farm of K. Vasilakis). The general area is know as Mnimata and is scattered with R tombs. In 1993, a LR bath-house was discovered, its furnace vaulted with brick and cement. (Kritiki Estia 5, 290-1) Apodoulou, Amari. Results of the 1992-94 seasons are report- ed in Kritiki Estia 5, 308-312. More rooms of the MM II com- plex at Gournes were excavated, revealing architecture and at least one floor belonging to two earlier phases. The WW II German excavation backfill proved to be quite rich in finds. At Katsalis, Ag. loannis, four trenches were opened. Amongst the finds were fragments of LM III 'goddesses with upraised arms' and a destruction deposit of HL pottery. (Kritiki Estia 5, 308-12) Aptera. W cemetery outside the walls. Several more tombs were located in 1992, including three pit graves cut in the rock. In one was found a HL inscription reading: Nt~cavop/ xt pe. A large R chamber tomb was also found, its dromos partly cut out of the rock and partly built with stones. The chamber was entirely rock-cut and used as a storage place by vil- lagers. It has been left as it was found. (ADelt 577-8) After a six-year gap, systematic excavations resumed inside the walls in 1993 and 1994. In sector I, building remains ranging from the 8th Ct BC to Byz times were investigated. A C peribolos wall, so far 17m in length, enclosed public buildings. Continued investigation could shed light on the 'wall of inscripti- ons' (M. Guarducci, IC II (1939) III, 9-13). A pyre with burnt animal bones and other finds was found near here, indicating religious activity at least in the HL period. In the area of the 'double shrine', the start of the anc. road was found between two peribolos walls, as well as an altar. Sector VI lies in the general area of the ancient theatre S of sector I. ECh and R building remains are reported. Four in situ column bases were discovered on their stylobate in 1993, while a large HL building was uncovered in 1994 with a peristyle courtyard which was closed up in the R period before its destruction by earthquake. (Kritiki Estia 5, 208-11) Argyroupole (anc. Lappa). On Zographaki-Gleka property, next to the plot investigated in 1986-1990 (AR 1994-95, 71), further remains of walls, floors and a drain were uncovered as well as a destruction level with domestic pottery of the 3rd Ct AD. While laying telephone lines, a R stone-built drain was found in 1993. Rescue excavation in 1993-4, on the I. Kartri- zakis property, exposed two R rooms, one using bedrock as the floor, and a cistern destroyed in the 3rd Ct AD. There were also three giftless graves in rock-cut hollows. On public land, a fine 'western style' geometric mosaic, first excavated before 1920, was unearthed with the idea that it would form an archaeological focus in the town. The walls as preserved are the bedrock itself plastered with hydraulic cement and veneered in marble indicating that this was part of a R bath-house. (Kritiki Estia 5, 246-50)</page><page sequence="122">122 DAVID BLACKMAN Armenoi, Rethymno. Investigation of the LM III cemetery continued in 1993 with the excavation of four tombs (217-220), all chamber tombs apart from 219, where only a dromos and empty recess had been cut out. Tomb 217 had a relatively short dromos (3.44 m), carefully-cut stomion and a chamber with three interments in situ but few grave goods; a niche in the dromos held a child burial. Tomb 218 also had a short dromos beginning with steps and a chamber with one burial in situ and three swept to one side, and a single LM III straight-sided alabastron. Tomb 220 had a particularly small burial chamber (1.25 by 1.15m) with one burial in situ in the N accompanied by a beak-spouted jug, and an infant burial swept to one side. The excavation of tomb 221 was left unfinished. (Kritiki Estia 5, 245-6) Astrikas, Kisamos. Two G chamber tombs were excavated in 1993. Tomb 1 was of the type previously known from the villages of Vounes and Gavalomouri to the E. Fifty-three 8th- Ct BC vases were accompanied by three human figurines inside a vase, a bronze tripod cauldron, 32 bronze objects, 15 iron objects (including rivets), six large pyramidal weights and various other objects of lead, glass, gold and stone. A funeral stele was decorated with four rosettes in relief. The tomb contained three burials. Tomb 2 was on the hill of Ilias to the E; 12 painted vases date it to the 8th Ct BC. Astrikas is known as an important C site and these tombs indicate that its foundation must go back to at least the G period. (Kritiki Estia 5, 215-6) Atsipadhes Korakias. The 1997 study season of the Atsipa- dhes Korakias peak sanctuary was undertaken in Rethymnon Museum in July and August. The team was directed by Dr Alan Peatfield (University College Dublin) and Dr Christine Morris (Trinity College Dublin), with the support of Ms Maria Vlasaki, Director of the West Cretan Ephorate. They report: "In 1996 the strewing and cataloguing of the figurines made substantial progress, focusing on the B trenches, and beginning the C trenches. As planned, this work was finally completed in this year 1997, focusing on all the remaining trenches, in areas C, D, and E. We were much assisted by the fact that the Rethymnon Museum apotheke where we work is at last fitted with some shelves. This has freed more space for strewing and study organisation. As a result we were also able to make a substantial number of new joins. The catalogue entries in their entirety were loaded onto computer. As a result we finally have a complete picture of the figurine distribution on the site. We discuss some of the broad elements below, though all the nuances will not emerge until the final study is complete. The study of pottery also made good progress. In addition we had the manpower and space to complete a number of other minor tasks: the stratigraphy of the upper terrace feature, the estimation of the total number of preserved cattle figurines, the study of F10; study of the B9 and B10 rock clefts as a discrete offering area. Human figurine gender distribution: in 1996 we observed that there was a distinct concentration of female figurines in the centre of the B trench area, male figurines out to the periphery. This pattern is less clear in C and D, though there is a slight predominance of male figurines among the diagnos- tic pieces. We have tried to set rigorous criteria for the identification of genders, and the issue of gender distribution and identification will be discussed in the final report. But so far the genders seem to be separated within this ritual context in a way similar to what we see in the Knossos miniature frescoes, the 'grandstand' fresco and the 'sacred grove' fresco. Human figurine gesture distribution: in 1996 we observed that the figurines on the upper terrace and in the B trench area adopt an arms-to-chest gesture. By contrast the figurines from the C and D trench areas almost all adopt an arms-upraised gesture. These latter gestures have many variations: arms up to sides, arms out straight to sides, arms up to front, arms up and rounded at chest height, arms up and rounded at head height. It seems too that the gestures are not gender-specific. Both genders adopt all types of gestures. The analysis of Minoan ritual gestures is relatively limited, The study and final publication of this material will offer us a major scope for new interpretation. One issue which needs to be addressed in our final study is how far this distribution of figurine offerings reflects a ritual reality for the function of the site. Animal distribution and numbers: there are more animal figurines in the A and B trench areas than in C and D. Indeed the proportion of animal figurines sharply drops off in those latter areas. This is unexpected, as we assumed that the numbers would remain constant over the site. We have also established procedures for determining hypothetical total preserved numbers of animal figurines on site. Most legs are identifiable as front or back, left or right. We are currently compiling the statistics for these over the whole site, and they will be presented in the 1998 report. Animal species: as reported previously most of the animal figurines from the site are cattle, in the small to medium size range. This year we have identified four small figures which all seem to be caprids. They are all apparently reclining with their front legs crossed, perhaps trussed prior to offering or sacrifice. A curve in their bodies suggest they may have been attached to vases. We have also been able to identify several more large hollow-made animal figures. These are not, however, wheel- made. They have a roughly triangular section, and seem to be made of three attached slabs. Unfortunately, it is not clear if these were intended to be animal rhyta. Though we have a number of hollow head fragments, only two preserve a pierced muzzle. B9 and BIO rock clefts: several deep clefts at the W edge of trenches B9 and B10 were examined as discrete offering areas. The figurines in them produced an unusual number of joins, indicating little post-depositional disturbance. These clefts will act as a control for final interpretations of the processes of figurine preservation on the site. Upper terrace feature stratigraphy: the upper terrace feature was dug by two different people. The stratigraphy of the two trenches needed to be integrated. The observation of the feature as being empty of finds was confirmed in both notebooks, and was observable in the zembils. The stratigraphy also confirmed that the feature was hollowed into the natural soil, and had been lined with stone chips. Additional study of the zembil material from the feature also revealed that eroded figurines were found at several levels at the edge of the feature. This suggest that whatever object stood in the feature, it was periodically removed, allowing figurines from the surface to fall into the hollow. Pottery: in previous years study had concentrated on the Final N pottery from the site, and a preliminary study of this material was presented to the 1996 Cretological Congress. This year study of the pottery was able to return to the Minoan material, picking up study of the B trenches. Cups and bridge- spouted jars were again the most common shapes. Some of these were quite fine, and preserved blue paint. Additionally</page><page sequence="123">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 123 there were a few fragments of larger open vessels, particularly in areas where there was open flat rock. Study also confirmed the observation made during excavation that in the central area of B, just below the upper terrace feature, there was relatively little pottery, despite the large numbers of figurines. The individual pieces were, however, better preserved than else- where on the site. This does suggest a differential votive pattern which needs further study." Axos, Mylopotamos. Excavation continued for a third season at the foot of the ancient acropolis on the SW at Megalos Traphos. Four trenches (19-22) were dug combined with three tests (7, 9 &amp; 10). A large number of Daedalic-Archaic figurines were recovered from a fill, and HL and R levels were ident- ified in trench 19. A similar picture was provided by trench 20 with HL and R burials (23-31) beneath the secondary fill which contained A. (ADelt 594-6; Kritiki Estia 5, 294-6) Boukolies, Kisamos. A HL pithos burial was found during road widening at Renta. (Kritiki Estia 5, 214) Chamalevri, Rethymno. Two areas were investigated in 1992 and 1993 at Bolanis on the D. Stratidakis farm. Three main phases were identified: transitional EM III/MM IA or early MM IA, advanced MM IA and early LM IIIC. Most architec- tural remains were of the second phase with pottery characterised by wheel-assisted cups more developed than in the first phase, decoration in both 'dark-on-light' and 'light-on- dark' with just a little polychrome ware, and 'egg-cup' footed goblets. There were just one or two examples illustrating the use of the slow and fast wheel. Early LM IIIC storage pits were found in the E sector filled with burnt grey earth, stones and pottery and dug into EM III/MM IA levels. A well dug out of the kouskouras bedrock appears to have gone out of use in early LM IIIC. Most of the remains belonged to MM IA, although EM III/MM IA pits were stratified beneath. A MM IA pebbled roadway divided the area. To the N were three hearths. The character of the MM IA remains is described as industrial and the numerous finds are discussed in some detail in ADelt 586-7. In sector II, MM IA and early LM III C levels were excavated, areas III-VI and the first phase of II belonging to the former period. A pit (B) beneath the trodden earth floor of room III yielded a stone vase and clay sealing impressed four times in the same place by a seal showing three lions in circular motion; the associated pottery was a mixture of EM III/MM IA and advanced MM IA. Room II was well paved with slabs during MM IA. The area suffered a destruction in advanced MM IA and remained unoccupied until early LM III C when a new building was constructed. In 1993, a small area to the S was dug uncovering three MM I pits and an early LM IIIC fill. (ADelt 583-90; Kritiki Estia 5, 251-7) Investigations in 1992 at the site of Tsikouriana, just N of the Bolanis site, revealed two levels of MM IA indicating that the settlement extended onto the SW of the hill. Part of the LM III cemetery was probably located at the N exit of the modern village. MM IA (two phases) and early LM IIIC remains were also found at Pateras, S of the Bolanis site on the Defteraios Farm. Two rooms, part of a third and spaces connected with a staircase were excavated, revealing two distinct floor levels 0.3m apart. Several early LM IIIC storage pits were found recalling the Bolanis site. Close by at Vromonera, on the Polioudaki Farm, tests in 1994 revealed a stony layer with LM IIIB/C and MM pottery. The site of Chatzametis (Evangelia Psoma farm) was already known from surface survey (S. Hood, P. Warren &amp; G. Cadogan, 'Travels in Crete, 1962' BSA 59 [1964] 65), and, after much agricultural damage, was investi- gated with 10 trenches in 1994. Remains of the early LM IIIC settlement were found as well as MM I. LM IIIC pits were characteristic as elsewhere at Chamalevri; MM III/LM IA pottery is also noted. Trench 10 yielded a good deal of LG and A as well as some R, indicating that Ist millennium occupation had also contributed to the destruction of the PR site. (Kritiki Estia 5, 260-2) Two trenches at the site of Melissa (D. Michelioudakis farm) yielded stony levels with MM IA pottery including a complete jug and part of a tripod 'table of offerings'. On another farm (Ath. Chatzidaki), three trenches recovered MM and LM pottery and reached bedrock at ca 2m. (Kritiki Estia 5, 262) At the site of Konidi, on the farm of K. Agathengelos, investigations in 1994 revealed a small amount of mostly early LM IIIC pottery. (Kritiki Estia 5, 264) The site at Kakavella is known from surface survey (Hood, Warren &amp; Cadogan, op.cit. 62-64). Fifteen trenches were opened on the property of S. Stratidaki where extensive agricultural damage had left only anc. foundations and much tumbled masonry including a large number of worked blocks, one with a large mason's mark, a 'branch'; three MM vases and obsidian are also noted. To the NW, preservation was better where a double room was uncovered with a LM IIIA1 destruction level. The pottery is akin to contemporary Knoss- ian, including the conical cups, and is discussed in detail in E. Hallager and B. Palson Hallager (Eds) Late Minoan III Pottery, Athens 1997, pp.111-51. (Kritiki Estia 5, 262-4) Chania. A trial excavation took place (N. Kaniamos property) just next to the lustral basin (Papadopoulos property) on Odos Daskaloiannis in the Splantzia area of the Old Town; this is SE of the Kastelli Hill in the region of the M town. Five trenches (I-V) were opened in advance of building as well as trench VI on the sidewalk. Two wells, walls and a tank belonged to the Ott period. In the 1st millennium BC, a LG well was cut into the kouskouras with internal cavities acting as steps. As well as LG pottery, it contained a good deal of early LM IIIC. Another well (LG II) was only partly investigated. A large pit (11) contained mostly HL pottery along with M, A, C and R. Noted are an early HL clay female head and part of another of R date and painted. On the E side of the plot, LM III walls incorporated the N side of an older LM I building and delin- eated three spaces. The largest was probably unroofed and had two successive floors (LM IIIA1 and 2) with traces of burning noticeable on the lower of the two. Building 8 to the S had gone out of use in LM IIIA2 with the construction above it of a mud-brick structure of unknown form and use. A built drain filled with LM IIIA/B pottery ran towards the HL pit 11, itself preceded by LM I pit 10. A possible LM II floor was also identified. The most important remains were of LM I date, notable because they all seem to belong to the same building complex as the lustral basin. The N part of this complex was revealed with an exterior courtyard. The area covered by the entire complex is more than 320m2, illustrating its importance. Huge numbers of conical cups were found all over the court, as if placed there on purpose. The main floor (6+25) of red and brown beaten earth dates to LM IA. Two pits had destroyed much of the W half, but on the floor were found a number of objects datable to the LM IA-B transition. A later floor belonged to LM IB (5+24) and was often characterised as a destruction level as opposed to trodden surface; pumice was</page><page sequence="124">124 DAVID BLACKMAN found amongst complete vases. A LM IIIA2 mud-brick structure was built above. A good deal of pumice came from LM I pit 10. The whole of the SE area of the excavation--- floors, drains and pit-yielded similar material with loose red- brown to grey earth containing sherds and bone and evidence of burning. The earliest and deepest paved area probably dates to the MM IIIB/LM IA transition, although earlier trodden surfaces do exist going back to EM; there are also MM IA and EM II structural remains. (ADelt 566-71) On Odos Varouches, W of the Mathioudakis plot, rescue excavations were carried out while the Water Board was digging a trench. Apart from two Venetian walls, there were various floors and walls dating from EM to LM. On the site of the former hotel Kipos, foundations of HL and R buildings were found in 1994 W of the Public Garden. (Kritiki Estia 5, 194-5). In lower levels, EM and MM remains were uncovered above bedrock, emphasising the substantial extent of the settlement centred around the Kastelli hill. The LM town was much more focussed towards the sea. A late C cist grave (4th Ct BC) was uncovered at Ag. Ioannis in 1994 (Andreadis property). (Kritiki Estia 5, 203-4) An ECh cist grave and HL and R structures are reported from Odos Ypsilandou. (Kritiki Estia 5, 204-5) Ten trenches on property (M. Balomanakis) by the Chania- Kisamos stretch of the National Road uncovered remains of a HL building complex. (Kritiki Estia 5, 205-6) Part of the M cemetery of Chania was uncovered (Manolik- akis property) on Odos Dimokratias where a neo-classical house was undergoing renovation. LM IIIA and B tombs came to light in the S part. Details are to be found in ADelt 571-4; only a few comments are made here. Seven chamber tombs were excavated and one described as pit-like with a side chamber. Long dromoi led to roughly rectangular chambers. Dromoi of other tombs were visible on the W side of the plot. Obvious similarities with Armenoi (Rethymnon) and other LM III cemeteries of Chania are noted. The pit-like tomb was similar to a key-shaped dromos with a side-niche cut into the middle of the E side. It held one burial; another was found just outside this at a lower depth and a further two burials came from a hollow in the floor of the main tomb and just above it. A pit grave shaped like the dromos of a chamber tomb contained a pair of burials with a fine double vase of local manufacture with a zoomorphic head and a bird painted on the shoulder. Two other tombs, one perhaps unfinished, are also described. For a recently published discussion of the LM III cemetery at Chania see Maria Andreadaki-Vlasaki, 'La n6cropole de Minoen Recent III de la ville de La Canee' in La Crate Mycinienne, 487-509. Trenching in advance of laying telephone lines uncovered tombs in Odos Tzanakakis. A pit grave of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC was found with five cist graves. One contained seven complete clay lamps, one with a representation of Eros, as well as two relatively complete glass unguentaria among many other objects and fragments of bone, bronze, iron and glass. Also in the road, between Nos. 64 and 66, settlement remains were found including a small kiln, a drain and two walls with earth floors. A pit contained everything from M to R, and at the start of the road, a MM pithos came to light, its top having been destroyed by an earlier electricity board trench. Drain works in Odos Psilakis uncovered a cist grave in front of No. 32 with two child burials of the late 4th or early 3rd Cts BC. Telephone works in Odos Konstantinoupolis uncovered three tile graves. One contained three successive child burials and a bronze arrowhead. They are dated to R but could be HL. Four rock-cut tombs and two tile burials were found on the Phortsakis property. Three glass unguentaria and two clay lamps, one with a Medusa, came from rock-cut tomb 1. The chamber of tomb 2 had benches on three sides with a burial on each. There were many grave gifts including 20 glass vessels, mostly unguentaria, smashed; seven clay lamps, some with relief decoration; a clay unguentarium and three funerary coins. Two rock-cut tombs were less well preserved. A date at the end of the 2nd or beginning of the 3rd Ct AD is proposed. (ADelt 576) Eleutherna. The University of Crete is investigating three main areas of the site-to the E, W and on the acropolis hill-under the direction respectively of P. Themelis, N. Stamboulides and Th. Kalpaxis. Four parts of area I, E of the acropolis, were investigated between 1992 and 1994: the settlement around the 'Roman House', the road and complex to the N, the basilica and its predecessor and, finally, the sacred enclosure S of the basilica. Continuous occupation was recorded in the first area, from HL through LR to ECh with some rooms, e.g. 23 and 26, being superbly preserved and reaching the second storey; room 26 retained the indentations left by the bamboo of the ceiling. The lintel between these two rooms bore an inscription: Neticqv tOt Kupetot. The destruction layer of 26 included much polychrome plaster and 50 bronze coins of the mid-3rd Ct AD. Room 23 had evidence for a mosaic floor from a bathroom. The destruction is attributed to the period of the expulsion of the Christians under Trajan (249-251 AD), indeed the inscribed lintel may recall Christian resistance to this at Eleutherna. The existence of Christians at the site in the mid- 3rd Ct AD may provide a reason for the later construction of the basilica. The secondary uphill road (6m wide) was uncovered for 30m along the faqade of the 'Roman House' and external wall of the settlement complex. A drain covered with slabs and running along the length of the street was filled with debris dating its blocking to the end of the 3rd Ct AD. The earliest material shows that both drain and street go back to the 1st Ct AD. Small dwellings were built on top of the street in the first Ch period (5th/6th Ct AD). Part of an extensive building complex (baths) was uncovered N of the 'Roman House', thus far revealing ancil- lary areas, a semicircular cistern and a hall with a semicircular room to one side preserved to a height of 2m. The initial core of settlement here belongs to HL. Three statues found in this area in 1956, 1967 and 1990 probably belonged to the rooms of this complex which is described as a public bath-house. Room 33, the hall, was used as late as the 7th Ct AD and contained complete vases including a possible import from Constantinople. Further W were remains of a paved area with a drain leading into the street drain, and a staircase; a fill recovered from the area contained six miniature temples and pottery comparable with that from the HL shrine and dated between the 1st Cts BC and AD. The ECh basilica is a tripartite building with a sizeable predecessor beneath it. The three aisles and narthex have been uncovered. The N and S aisles and the narthex had four- coloured mosaic floors with plant, geometric and pictorial motifs as fill in zones. The central aisle is paved with rectangu- lar slabs of local white limestone. The walls and pillars were decorated with polychrome opus sectile. Stone reliefs were found strewn amongst the debris of the final destruction in the 7th Ct AD, some in situ. An inscription used as a threshold in the S aisle probably honours an officer of Eleutherna. The monumental staircase leading to the N entrance of the narthex</page><page sequence="125">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 125 was fully uncovered. The mosaic floor of the narthex itself bears two inscriptions, in black tesserae on a white background, one of which reads: E?)patr&amp;, 6 dytt6ratoo 'E"tt orolto;, trrftt 68F- rb / 0tov rtgevo;, otiov E CntpeIt t; t~iWo; yt pa; / MtXafh rtol 'ApXavyt~ou, ontep rtpeptoat X)6ptg 0jo-tr ol t(v). The inscription reveals that the founder of the basilica was Euphratas, bishop of Eleutherna, and the dedication was to the Archangel Michael. Euphratas, the first bishop of Eleutherna, is known to have taken part in the Ecumenical Synod of Chalkedon in 451 AD, thereby providing a terminus ante quem for the construction of the basilica, the seat of the bishop. Such a secure date of construction (between 430 and 450 AD) is very rare in Greece. Three double-sided marble hermaic pillars, probably 1st Ct BC, had been re-used as lintels for three doors leading to the aisle, after their sexual organs and heads had been removed. Double-sided herms are said to be lacking in Crete and rare in the rest of Greece. The basilica was founded on a HL religious structure and re-used some of the earlier masonry. G and R pottery in fills indicates a long history of human activity here, and continuity of worship, at least from HL into ECh, is suggested by the excavator. A long narrow set of rooms S of the narthex was used for interments in the 6th/7th Cts AD. Above one tomb (32) an inscribed plaque records the death of the Ambassador of Nikasios in the 6th Ct AD. More tombs were found S of the basilica on top of the HL sanctuary, bringing the number of cist and tile graves found to 42, all 6th/7th-Ct AD. A vaulted tomb was also excavated. Eleutherna was probably destroyed at the end of the reign of Emperor Constantine II (641-668 AD). The cause of its destruction along with all other cities in Crete remains open to discussion-earthquakes, the Arab invasion, the early barbarian incursions into the Peloponnese. The HL sanctuary comprises a monumental rectangular building (9.5 by 17m), a rarity in Crete with the exception of the half-finished Doric temple of Diktynna and Pythios at Gortyn. Dating material for three phases comes chiefly from foundation fills covering the 2nd Ct BC to Ist Ct AD. The first two phases pre-date the disaster of 67 BC, while the third post- dates it (Augustan and Tiberian). Traces of a severe fire mark the end of phase II and allow it to be equated with the 67 BC destruction. Area II or Pyrgi is the acropolis of the city, the E side of which has been under investigation. Groups of roughly built Byz houses were uncovered as well as a possible public building with bench and drain. The houses do not lie on earlier remains although a fill above bedrock, which includes a Doric cornice, may relate to the destruction of HL Eleutherna during the R conquest. Walls inside the E vault were found to be ECh in date and not A as previously supposed. Some walls further W, however, do definitely belong to the G/A and even M periods. EM and LM pottery has been found in the lowest levels. All this indicates intensive settlement of the area from PR to at least C times. To the N of the Church of Ag. Anna, a rock-cut cistern which had originally belonged to a HL house but remained in use into Byz, was cleaned out. The two enormous rock-cut cisterns and the tunnel on the E, the so-called Anemospilio, were studied and recorded for the first time, despite the fact that they have been known since the 19th Ct. At the site of Nesi, on the farm of S. Nikoloudakis, N of the recently published HL house, investigation has proved that the entire area was occupied by HL housing, each of the 3-4 excavated houses having their own cistern of the kind now known in about 50 instances on the plateau. The cisterns are all rock-cut with a cubic capacity of around 16m3. The houses had internal courts, in one of which was a pottery kiln of the 3rd to Ist Cts BC. A broad (3.2m), paved road ran between the houses, first from W to E to the highest point of the hill and then Swards to an unknown destination. It is dated to the 2nd Ct BC. About 30 rock-cut tombs on the W slope appear to belong to the HL cemetery. (Kritiki Estia 5, 283-6) W of Pyrgi is area III where three locations were investi- gated between 1992 and 1994: the quarry of Peristeri (surface survey), the site of Xeniana NW of the cemetery on the W bank of the river Chalopotas and the G-A cemetery at Orthi Petra. A topographic survey was undertaken under the auspices of the University of Crete, by the Department of Geography, Cambridge University. The quarry examination concentrated on two rock-cut caverns which bore tool-marks from quarrying. LR and, perhaps, G pottery was noted. At Xeniana, part of a LG-EA building was found to have been cut by a large isodomic HL wall which had been revealed in 1984 during road widening. More funeral pyres were found at the cemetery of Orthi Petra, E of the pyre of the warrior and victim whose throat had been cut. N of the enclosure of hero6n 4a, under the 'Venetian' olive tree, a row of foundations for funerary buildings came to light belonging to the late 7th to early 6th Ct BC. Nearby, remains of a massive pillar, parts of which had already been found in the surrounding area between 1990 and 1994, probably belonged to a funerary column identifying the location of the pyres. A row of ash urns, covered with clay or bronze vessels, was found next to the road and the entrance to a rock-cut chamber tomb. (Kritiki Estia 5, 287-290) Epanochori: Tsiskiana, Selinou (AR 1993-94, 84). After a five-year gap in excavation, a small amount of work was carried out at the shrine in 1992. A test, on the W side of the altar where it was clear that this was not part of the original construction, produced five layers of slabs with ash in between and containing small fragments of ovicaprid bones and bull figurines. The end of the test revealed what was probably the original floor of the altar with carefully placed slabs, heavily burnt. Clearly the altar reached its final form after many additions over a long period of use. Other investigations showed that the altar may have been preceded by a phase of ritual involving pyres, although this cannot be dated. A third terrace was located. Much R pottery was recovered as well as part of a marble inscription first reported in ADelt 42, 567-568. The site has been protected with a fill of sand. (ADelt 583) Investigations in 1993 concentrated on the N extension of the sanctuary area. A fragment of a bovid figure is reported analogous to the 436 found in 1987 from terrace 1. The existence and, perhaps, continuation of terracing S of the Ch church was confirmed. (Kritiki Estia 5, 236-38) Gavdos. The island is the southernmost point of Greece and is of potential historic importance due to its position at a cross- roads of the Near East, North Africa and the West Mediter- ranean. Surface survey is being undertaken by the University of Rethymnon and the 25th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities. During 1992-1995, 62 sites were located. The earliest human habitation appears to be in late N-EM I. All PR periods are represented with some emphasis on EM and MM. Seaside and inland sites of the historical periods are chiefly HL, LR and Byz. Later remains of the 19th and early to mid-20th Cts AD are also known. (Kritiki Estia 5, 242-5)</page><page sequence="126">126 DAVID BLACKMAN Georgioupolis, Apokoronas. Investigations on the property of X. Grillakis revealed 3rd-Ct AD remains and a destruction level filled with domestic wares fallen from wooden shelving, burnt traces of which were found. (ADelt 578-9) 3rd-Ct BC levels found on the Syngelakis property in 1993 emphasize the extent of the settlement when combined with the information from the Gryllakis plot. (Kritiki Estia 5, 214-5) Kalami. An undated cist grave with cover slabs is noted W of the football field. (Kritiki Estia 5, 212) Kalyriani, Kisamos. The discovery of an inscribed stone at Tyliphos may indicate the existence of a shrine here, E of Phalasama. It records, in 22 lines, a peace treaty between Phalasama and Polyrrenia in the early HL period; it includes the symbol of Phalasama: a trident with dolphins and sea creatures on either side and the word ?EOI. (Kritiki Estia 5, 216-17) Kastelli, Kisamos (AR 1996-97, 121-2). A large building plot (A. and G. Raisakis, 746.37m2) was investigated between February 1991 and November 1992. Two main R building phases and one ECh were uncovered much destroyed by ploughing and building. LR building remains were found across the S, with walls of rough stones and concrete but no floors preserved of the two rooms identified. A semicircular cistern was tentatively identified. To the N was a pebbled roadway with building remains of R and ECh on the other side. A large LR complex was uncovered which extended E into the neighbouring property and all over the centre and W. A well, drainage systems and small hearths were notable. To the W were traces of earlier building phases with plastered walls of worked blocks and a fine mosaic floor, the main theme of which is Orpheus playing his lyre surrounded by wild ani- mals-wild boar, panthers, goats and snakes. A later floor lay above the mosaic. N and S of this were other rooms with mosaics largely destroyed in antiquity. An ECh cemetery (4th to 5th Cts AD) was divided from the settlement by a wall running SE-NW, part of which had already been constructed during the R period. Eight stone-lined cist graves, devoid of goods, were excavated by the Ephorate. Two headless skeletons may indicate death by beheading. Other cist graves had covering slabs and yielded inscriptions, two of which indicated burials belonging to a priest and his wife. In levels beneath the cemetery were found the remains of an earlier R complex with walls of worked stone and drainage systems of mud-brick and hydraulic plaster or clay pipes. Amongst the finds were bronze coins and a small statue of Eros holding an amphora (2nd Ct AD). A plot (155.66m2) in the S sector of ancient and modem Kisamos (K. Plevrakis plot) revealed two building phases, LR and the end of the 4th Ct AD. The finds, however, are said to range from the 3rd Ct AD, much of the pottery being 5th-Ct. Of 55 bronze coins, a good many were Byz. An Ch funerary inscription of eleven lines is also noted. (ADelt 47, 581-3) During the 1994 excavation at the Health Centre (AR 1996- 97, 121), work in sector I was extended W and another mosaic floor uncovered. Room 11 is semicircular like room 3, an arrangement paralleled at the Villa Dionysos at Dion, and had a superb, signed mosaic floor two thirds of which was pre- served. It has two pictorial scenes taken from comedies of Menander, as in a 2nd-Ct AD wall painting at Ephesus and the 3rd-Ct AD mosaic of Menander at Mytilene. Scenes from other comedies are already known from the 3rd-Ct AD Dionysos and Ariadne mosaic in Chania Museum. The so-called Centaur mosaic was completely uncovered. It is of poor quality compared with the others. Large tesserae are used for a geometric composition with shields, axes and kantharoi in the corners. As in rooms 9 and 10, evidence of an upper storey mosaic floor was found in the destruction level. The head of conservation, lannis Danglis, determined that the room 11 mosaic should be lifted, as conservation in situ was almost impossible due to subsidence; for the winter it was covered with geotextile. (Kritiki Estia 5, 217-20) Maria Niotaki plot: rescue excavation took place S of the town where illegal digging had taken place. Part of the R water system for Kisamos was uncovered, including water-channels sloping down towards the N and a large cistern (15.75 by 2.00 by 2.21m) which was later re-used with a hearth of roof-tiles inside. Another double cistern was found to the W. Possible evidence of a metallurgical installation was found nearby to which the cisterns may have been related. Pottery from this plot ranged from the 3rd to 4th Cts AD. (Kritiki Estia 5, 223-4) A series of R tombs were found at the 2nd Primary School. Two were large built tombs of Punic type, one with marble veneer in the burial chamber, of the lst-2nd Cts AD. Eleven were cist graves covered by roof-tiles; no grave gifts were found. (Kritiki Estia 5, 225-6) V. Paterakis plot: located on the N side of the central plateia of Kisamos, where the marvellous mosaic of the Seasons had been found (Kritiki Estia 1, 3-59), 2nd-3rd Ct AD remains were uncovered totally unconnected with the mosaic. A drain covered with slabs-later used as a road surface-and street house remains and floors were found. (Kritiki Estia 5, 226-7) E. Theodosakis plot: an offshoot of the central R drainage system to the S was found as well as an ECh kiln and R wall remains. (Kritiki Estia 5, 227) Despotakis plot: a R refuse pit dug into the bedrock produced pottery and metal objects including arrowheads. (Kritiki Estia 5, 228) Kavousi-Charkia. Known since 1986 as a M site, excavations took place in 1991 and 1992 at Rousses, 2 km SW of Kavousi, the first time such a site had been located between the Arkadi Monastery and the community of Charkia. Eight trenches (I- VIII) were opened on the farm of M. Katsanevas. Architectural remains had been destroyed by ploughing but pottery was abundant covering EM I-II, MM II, MM III-LM IA and LM III A/B. A gap in occupation during LM IB and II is noted On the farm of Gr. Lagoudakis, remains of rooms were found in two spots, one of which was LM I. (ADelt 591-2) Kryoneri, Mylopotamos. Rescue excavations in 1993 revealed a one H period MM storage room with three relief pithoi by the E wall, one complete and placed upside down on a carbonised wooden plank. The building had been abandoned, not violently destroyed. Other M walls are visible in the vicinity. (Kritiki Estia 5, 296-8) Lisos, Selinou. A programme of cleaning, surface and topo- graphical survey of the HL and later site began in 1994. The site occupies most of the valley and is delimited by the mountains and sea. The only systematic excavation to have taken place was some forty years ago by N. Platon (Kritika Chronika 11, 337; 12, 465; 13, 376; 14, 516). Unobtrusive pathways were made linking the main areas and the sea (Asklepieion-necropolis-sea, etc.). In the process of clearing undergrowth, remains of a good many ancient houses were uncovered which had not previously been noted. The survey dealt with the five main areas of the ancient city, four of which are the Asklepieion and its ancillary buildings, the administra-</page><page sequence="127">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1997-98 127 tive centre probably S of the Asklepieion near the present day guard's hut, the necropolis W and SW of the site and the E of the site which is covered in terraces supporting buildings. 118 tombs are visible at the necropolis, mostly vaulted single chambers, rectangular in plan. All vaults were covered with hydraulic plaster. The number of niches inside each tomb may correspond to the number of interments. There are three examples of two-storied tombs, one of which was probably constructed during a second phase. A fifth area of the city is the harbour and its constructions. A large wall 150m NW of the beach, 25m long and 1.5m wide, appears to be the mole. Ancillary buildings lie N and NW of this. The ancient road- ways were located: one from the SE corner of the Asklepieion to the area N of the ECh basilica of the Panayia; another from the W of the Asklepieion running towards the gorge; and a third W of the theatre, running first S then W, probably the main road to Hyrtakina. (Kritiki Estia 5, 238-241) Melidoni Cave. A fourth season of rescue excavation took place in 1992 (ADelt 594). A very thick FN fill was found in the Hall of the Heroes as well as levels filling the stratigraphic gap between LM and A levels and confirming use into R times. This trench (B) and trench A were backfilled. In front of the entrance to the N inner chamber, a level rich in MM III/LM I pottery was found with traces of ash and charcoal; beneath was an EM level, and on bedrock, a third with unfired pottery. A mixed level of black earth from the W part of the N inner chamber yielded A figurines, R pottery and animal bones. EM levels were also identified here with another layer containing human remains lying beneath on bedrock. (ADelt 594; Kritiki Estia 5, 291-3) Modi. At a farm just E of the village, a LM IIIA: 1 farmstead was discovered in 1992 largely destroyed by ploughing. It appears to have been a large one-roomed building (5 x 4.5m) with a trodden kouskouras floor and a hearth of three upright slabs in the middle. Finds included cooking pot sherds and pithoi with rope pattern decoration as well as a cylindrical pyxis with lid. This is the first LM IIIA discovery in the area which is otherwise known for the LM IA settlement at Vrysses and a PG cemetery at Modi. (ADelt 577) Monastiraki, Amari. The 1992-94 campaigns concentrated on the E side of the hill where the large complex of storage rooms is located. The palatial complex was built at the start of the Old Palace period and went through three architectural phases before its destruction at the end of the period. The existence of upper storeys was confirmed. More sealings came from the large storeroom where the second archive had been found. An approach road to the complex had evidence for two phases of use, both Old Palace. A series of HL rooms were founded on top of M walls and contained mostly storage vessels. On the S slope of the hill in the area of the first sealing archive deposit, cleaning revealed rooms and a roadway for future excavation. (Kritki Estia 5, 313-14) Mournies. Building works here, opposite the Naval installa- tion, revealed a pit with MM to LM I pottery near the surface; some semi-worked blocks and a large threshold were found in the vicinity, indicating settlement remains now largely destroyed. (ADelt 577) Nea Magnesia. Two poor, shallow R graves are reported on the farm of E. Gouliemakis, one covered with tiles, the other with slabs. Grave gifts with the first (single burial) included a glass tear-bottle and with the second (two burials) two bronze coins of the 4th Ct AD. (Kritiki Estia 5, 265-6) Patsos cave. Rescue excavations in 1994 at the sanctuary of Hermes Kranaios at Ag. Antonios, much pillaged at the end of the last century, were aimed at examining the remaining stratigraphy and the evidence for ancient cult. Outside the rock- shelter, the disturbed levels proved deep and rich in finds: human and animal figurine fragments, fine pottery, bones and horncores. Cuttings in the bedrock contained small pyres with a few bones and sherds indicating a connection with ritual. Further investigation of the 1989 HL pyre uncovered part of a rough terrace wall. G sherds were most common, but M, A, HL and R also occurred. (Kritiki Estia 5, 307) Pera Galinoi, Mylopotamos. In 1993 a M settlement had been found here on two small rises by the sea. A complex of rooms with plastered walls preserved to a height of 0.5 m was uncovered in 1993. The floor of one room was paved with fine schist slabs. Evidence for an earthquake destruction was found in the form of a marked curvature to one wall and fallen upper storey debris. The MM IIB destruction material included an eggshell Kamares cup, probably a Knossian import. (Kritiki Estia 5, 293-4) Phalasarna. Clearance work was carried out in 1992 by E. Hatzidaki of the anc. harbour installations between the N tower and the NW fortification, around the supposed NE tower, and the NE of the military harbour where the excavator believed the shipsheds may lie but now has doubts. (ADelt 697-700) Work took place between 1992 and 1994 in the area of the NW fortification, the N tower and the harbour installations. The NW fortification, a work chiefly of the 4th Ct BC, is of large isodomic masonry. Four tombs were uncovered immedi- ately to the S, one running along wall 5, the other three at right angles to it. Identical in size (1.05 by 0.63m) they have two levels inside, rather like a sitting bath, with a circular depress- ion, which was probably covered with lead, at the bottom. Their interiors are covered with hydraulic plaster. This appears to be a workshop area for cleaning or producing some material e.g. metals or clay. This is based on their location outside the city proper, the occurrence of domestic pottery, unbaked clay and metal fragments, as well as a grey burnt colouring found SW of the tanks. Elsewhere, a worked block of tower I was found to be inscribed with the word AIA1. The NE tower was in all probability located. Tests NE of the harbour, in search of the shipsheds of Phalasarna, revealed an area which is a good candidate for such a function. Seasons in 1993 and 1994 concentrated on the space between walls 1 and 4 since it is here that some form of entrance from the naval harbour to the inner 'lagoon' of brackish water should exist. The discovery of a substantial wall 2m high and Im wide led to the conclusion that it (wall 4) is a continuation of wall 1 which itself linked up with the city walls dividing the naval harbour from the 'lagoon'. More importantly, a religious area adjacent to the W side of the wall is hypothesized on the basis of the discovery of an offering table of sheet metal with two snakes, curled up and heads raised, upon it covered by a silver Megarian bowl. It was found in front of a construction of two orthostats, probably an altar related to a chthonic deity. Two Phalasamrna bronze coins were found with a dolphin on the obverse and the ubiquitous I on the reverse. Excavation was also undertaken along the wall footing</page><page sequence="128">128 DAVID BLACKMAN found between the N and NW towers in order to investigate harbourworks. It turned out that the wall was actually the quayside, the fill on the W and S being filled with sea-shells. Excavation along the exterior of the NW fortification revealed a fine cobbled roadway, orientated NE-SW, inter- rupted at one point by a later drain. (Kritiki Estia 5, 230-6) Polyrrenia. I. Sphakianakis plot: the property here is enclosed by the ancient wall and it was clear before excavation that one of Polyrrenia's rock-cut houses stood here. It was cut into the rock on the E and N and built of stone on the other two sides. Its use began in the middle of the HL period and continued into imperial R times. A built wall, parallel to the E rock-cut wall, went with a floor with a R glass lamp and its bronze suspension chain fallen upon it. An earlier HL floor was covered with a destruction layer of roof-tiles. Another floor beneath this made use of the bedrock. The finest phase of the house was clearly in the middle HL period when it had an entrance and large stone threshold on the S. A large part of a stone cornice had fallen inside the entrance. A thick destruction level of roof-tiles was also characteristic of the first phase. Sphakaki Pangalochori, Rethymno. Property of Mytilenaios brothers: five complete rooms and parts of others were found by the sea with a 2nd-Ct AD destruction layer of roof-tiles. Two rooms had mosaic floors. A further eight rooms, founded on bedrock, came to light in the middle of the plot, again with a destruction level. (Kritiki Estia 5, 251) Stavromenos, Chamalevri. Two small cist tombs of R date were located by chance on the Psarros property in 1991 on the E side of Stavromenos. Seven R cist tombs were excavated at Vardia on the Stavromenos beach. (ADelt 590-1) Sybritos, Amari. This excavation, a collaboration between the 25th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities and the Instituto per gli Studi Micenei ed Egeo-Anatolici of CNR, has revealed both structures and storage pits associated with early LM IIIC pottery which has been discussed in detail in E. Hallager and B.P. Hallager (Eds) Late Minoan III Pottery, Athens 1997, 371-394 (with refs). The 1993 and 1994 seasons revealed not only Building B (near A with Pits 41-45 between) but also walls of the succeeding phase of settlement. Important PG and G came from the S sector as well as building remains dated to the 8th Ct BC.

In certain situations this could not be rigorously adhered to, given, for example, the fact that many Byzantine coins circulating in the area of modern Greece were minted in Constantinople. This survey spans two academic years because it could not be included in last year's Archaeological Reports, as was noted then in the Introduction (p. 1). Finds of coins from specific localities, as well as studies concerned with particular mints, are listed below under the same topographical regions used in 'A in G'. It should be noted, however, that the search for bibliography and for coin finds was not aimed at being exhaustive. For abbreviations used, see inside front cover.
