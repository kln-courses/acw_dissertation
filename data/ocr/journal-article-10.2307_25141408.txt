<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART THIRTY-FOURTH YEAR NOVEMBER, 1947 NUMBER NINE EXHIBITION OF GOLD (G OLD-the name brings with it drama, drama of material which from the earliest times has been sought for greed ily. Heavy, lustrous, of greatvalue, beautiful in color, it possesses qualities which from the first civilization have made it the hand maid of man; it is malleable, ductile to the greatest degree. When combined with other metals, its potentialities as a ma terial are enormously increased. Through choice of alloy, various effects of color can be achieved and the desired hardness or softness necessary. The Cleveland Museum of Art is holding, from October 31 through January 11, an "Exhibition of Gold," featuring gold, the material, as it has been creatively fashioned through the ages by the fingers of the goldsmith. The exhibition makes no pretense at being exhaustive. Held together by an idea and a material, it shows the changing tastes in the more sumptuous pages of history. The majority of the pieces exhibited come under the general term, jewelry, made for personal adornment, but there are supreme examples of goldsmiths' work, as well: the Gertrudis altar and the crosses from the Guelph Treasure, the gold and rock crystal cross, all from the Museum's collection; and a wonderful tiny triptych in gold and translucent enamel, Bur gundian, fifteenth century, a Mycenaean cup, a Persian ewer, all generously lent for the exhibition. Gold was known and used by the Egyptian, Cretan, Achae menid, Etruscan. The Greek and Roman employed it extensive ly. The gorgeous ceremonial garments of Byzantium were enriched by chains, necklaces, bracelets, earrings of astonishing intricacy and richness. Iran, Mesopotamia, Syria were past masters in the handling of this fascinating material. The races of the Folkwandering time fashioned sword fittings, buckles, fibulae, other articles of personal adornment from it. Published monthly, excepting July and August, by The Cleveland Museum of Art, in Wade Park, University Center Station, Cleveland, Ohio. Subscription included in membership fee, other wise $1.50 per year. Single copies, 15 cents. Copyright, 1947, by The Cleveland Museum of Art. Entered as second class matter March 6, 1930, at the Post Office at Cleveland, Ohio, under the Act of August 24, 1912. 211</page><page sequence="2">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART The tenth and eleventh centuries were literally an age of gold. In the twelfth century taste changes, or is it an economic question? Then, many of the church ornaments were made of silver-gilt or gilt-copper, instead. However, in the earlier cen turies mentioned, gorgeous church ornaments of gold were decorated with cloisonne enamel and jewels. The Cathedral Treasuries of Europe retain precious examples of the golden era to this day, and the Cleveland Museum's greatest treasure, the Gertrudis altar, ranks with the most notable of these. Gothic and Renaissance centuries used this workable metal freely, combining it at times with other materials, with translu cent and opaque enamel, with precious and semi-precious stones. The characteristic Renaissance jewel, usually conceived of as an architectural composition, was particularly dependent on these enrichments, used with often bewildering complexity. Textiles, where gold has been woven into the fabric, are an unusual feature of the exhibition. All of the earlier pieces feature the use of "Cyprian gold," that is, gold applied to parchment, cut in narrow strips, and wound around a core of silk. For the later pieces a variety of techniques are used, the more usual being metal foil wrapped around silk. Paintings with burnished background of leaf gold, illuminated miniatures, glass, enamel, complete the pattern of an exhibition which features this precious golden metal in its many varied and characteristic uses. Generous loans from museums, private individuals, and galleries have made possible the success of the exhibition, and the Museum wishes to express its appreciation to the following lenders: Art Association of Montreal; The Brooklyn Museum; Brummer Gallery; The Detroit Institute of Arts; Harvard University, the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collec tion; Duveen Brothers, Inc.; French &amp; Company, Inc.; Edward Gans; Mrs. E.
