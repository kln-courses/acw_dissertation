All night long, pro cessions of men and women carrying standards stretch from the Toluca highway to the Paseo de la Reforma as they slowly make their way toward the Basilica on foot. It is a noctur nal pilgrimage, peppered with the vivid colors of the pleated brocaded satin and lace gowns worn by Mazahua women. And if we were to ask a random passerby about the identity of these devout individuals, these women dressed in such striking clothing, the answer would likely be anything but correct. Despite their proximity to the Valley of Mexico, the Mazahuas of the State of Mexico and Michoacán remain largely invisible to most inhabitants of the capital city. Their culture has rarely even captured the professional interest of anthropologists and historians. And Mazahua textiles are even more of an unknown quantity. They attest to how their makers live, how they view their world and how they represent the symbols of their culture. They serve a variety of functions, being used to make everything from clothing for personal use to objects for sale, including tablecloths, blankets, cushions, rucksacks, and so forth. They are also made as offerings: embroidered tapestries can often be seen covering altars and walls at special ceremonies such as those held to mark saints' days. Since the I97°s&gt; the inhabitants of Mexico City have become accustomed to seeing women dressed in tradi tional costume selling fruit on street corners. Later on, they began selling rag dolls wearing calico caps or brightly colored ribbons in their hair, and the similarly garbed vendors sat and embroidered as they offered their wares. People started calling them marías. I have never heard any one call them Mazahuas, and today they are not seen as often as they used to be. Urban dwellers confuse them with women from other ethnic groups in Mexico. But the Mazahuas are unique, with ancient roots, age-old cus toms and a language of their own that is closely tied to that of the Otomis. In the early 1970s, the character known as La India Maria first made her appearance on Mexican television, dressed in the costume of a Mazahua woman. In this issue of Artes de México, the historian Maricruz Castro an alyzes this character who became a stereotype and an enormously popular media figure, but whose similari ties to real Mazahua women end with the costume. Cas tro's article discusses the collective imaginary that tends to view indigenous cultures in a peculiar fashion, and with not a little indifference. In a sense, the character of La India María adds to our ignorance not only of Mazahua culture, but of many of the other cultures that make up this country. Elena Poniatowska contributes some vignettes about the marías who moved to the big city forty years ago, and those who remained in their hometowns, working at the new factories being built in the area. Through her words, we gain a sense of how these women have adapted to their changing circumstances, and the vast distance that lies be tween them and the abovementioned star of variety shows and movies. Gabriela Olmos describes her experiences at some of the saints' day celebrations in towns such as San Felipe Santiago, Santa Rosa de Lima and San Felipe del Progreso. She and the rest of the team at Artes de México of fer some compelling images of the fervent and visually ap pealing manner in which these communities honor their patron saints. Mazahuas are renowned for their skilled embroidery and weaving on the backstrap loom. They have man aged to keep their traditional dress alive to this day, and each community cultivates its own unique costume. Many women from the northern part of the State of Mexico wear what is known as a lía: two lengths of fabric sewn together horizontally with an embroidered design along the edge. The finished garment is intricately folded and wrapped around the waist. But most wear a kind of blouse known as a saco, with a brightly colored pleated skirt that is an attractive all-occasion garment, and an underskirt with an embroidered hem. The embroidered designs vary from town to town. This issue discusses three important aspects of Mazahua textiles. Mazahua writer Ignacio Vázquez Parra contributes an article on sashes, a garment that holds one key to this group's identity. In it, he explains the symbolism of some of their common woven motifs. Monica Ruiz writes about an ancient tradition linked to the myths of corn which gave rise to the ritual of the Xita—Mazahua for "elders"—whose costumes and masks are astonishing in their creativity, hav ing evolved over the years without ever losing their unique character. Sheri Brautigam tells us of a Mazahua woolen costume used in Santa Rosa de Lima that is so complicated to make it is in danger of disappearing entirely. For centuries the Mazahuas have held on to their lan guage and traditions despite being exposed to massive so cietal change, which would naturally put them in danger of losing such practices if the members of this group did not persist in their efforts to keep them alive and in con stant transformation. Fortunately there have been some exemplary individuals who have stood in defense of this culture and resisted the homogenizing trend. One such man was Julio Garduño (l94°~2007), eulogized hereby Pamela Scheinman. With this issue, we hope to reinforce one of our mis sions at Artes de México: to act as a guardian of this coun try's cultural diversity. In fact, we were proud to receive an award from the Pen Club for our efforts in this area in 20IO, though we accepted it as more of a responsibil ity than an accolade. And now we want to show the world some of the richness of Mazahua textiles and promote a real interest in this culture that is so close to us but at the same time, invisible to so many.

From the Loom to Electric Appliances The Mazahua region of the State of Mexico comprises the municipalities of El Oro, Ixtlahuaca, San Fe lipe Santiago, and borders the states of Micho acán and Querétaro. To get to San Felipe, one follows the highway to Toluca, crossing part of the State of Mexico. As soon as the Toluca-Atlacomulco highway was inaugu rated in 1945' Mazahua people began to emigrate to the capital. Mazahuas from Santo Domingo de Guzmán were among the first ones to leave—women moved not only to the big city, but also to Pastejé, known for its cattle ranch, and now for its electrical appliance factory. Young wom en sat beside a conveyor belt handling sets of parts arriv ing from other sections of the plant and assembling elec tricity and water meters or machining dies, bolts, electric conductors, bulb holders, rowlocks, gas meters, fuses, and other implements. The factory provided work to many peasants who were drawn to it out of curiosity and locked themselves inside its wide chambers of serrated teeth. Instead of soil and seeds, hay and corncobs, they handled aluminum, plastic and glass, wire, metal sheets and ingots. Modernity consists in perforating, making al loys and inserting pipes. Did they miss the smell of fresh grass? In December 1964. 7°° young, barefoot Maza hua women were hired by an affiliate plant and exchanged their twenty underskirts for some short dresses and skirts made of synthetic fabrics. What impressed these young women most was a gift from the management: being able to go to a store in Ixtlahuaca to choose their favorite pair of shoes. II. Petticoat Floor-Sweeper "I asked Inocencio to let me dress like those factory girls, but no; I sewed a dress like that for myself and he didn't like it. They started calling those girls from the Pastejé factory The Petticoat Floor-Sweepers, and that's when they stopped wearing those skirts. They would mock the girls saying they swept the floor with them. Now the young girls don't make their own garments anymore. They just buy them ready made." "For a short while my wife dressed like that, but I didn't like it, because I knew she'd get cold. So I told her: 'Get rid of those dresses, and I'll buy you some fabric so you can sew a full petticoat to cover your legs below your knees so you don't get cold. Then you'll top that with a two- or three-part skirt, nicely tied at the waist so it holds everything up properly.' But the petticoats are embar rassing,' she said. 'Well don't be embarrassed. Everyone knows we're country folk. Stop it. We're ranchers, not city people. Don't worry about your petticoats—wear them proudly in Toluca.' And so I bought her five or six yards of tulle, satin, charmeuse—a lot of fabric, so she could make what she wanted. I didn't buy her a sewing machine, because I told her, 'You've had a lot of practice with one of those—I know you're going to end up making clothes for other people, and you'll tire yourself out.' Now when she wants to sew something, she goes to see her kids, her daughter-in-law, and borrows her sewing machine for a little while." III. The Streets Are Like Going to the Movies After moving to the city, many of the women from San Felipe Santiago started off as maids or housekeepers, and later on, those who got pregnant became "manas." Word spread around town that "the marias earn good mon ey." And many ex-farmers who had become construction workers in Mexico City brought their wives along so they could become street vendors—first selling fruit, and then chewing gum and Kleenex. In a single day, the marias could make twice as much as their construction-worker husbands, without working too hard, since going from car-window to car-window seemed rather entertaining to them. "I like [working in] the street, it's nice, I tell you; lots of interesting things happen there. It's like going to the movies." Unlike the factory workers at Pastejé, the marias kept wearing their twenty patterned underskirts, their colorful braids and their frilly blouses in shades of bright pur plish blue, parakeet green, chartreuse and snow white. And right there on the street medians, with their babies resting in shawls tied onto their backs, they continued to embroider their wide sashes and other textiles that are so sought after in the city and that distinguish them from other street vendors. Others soon realized that the Maza hua women were selling more—dressed the way they were and carrying their children—than the women dressed in blue jeans who sold their wares at bus stops or in subway tunnels in neighborhoods like Coyoacán or Chimalistac, or along avenues like Romero de Terreros, Miguel Angel de Quevedo or Universidad. "It's easier for me to be a street vendor than to card or spin the wool for a poncho and a quechquémetl There is nothing more beautiful than a poncho or a quechquémetl, the weaving and embroideries on under skirts, tablecloths, linens, placemats, bags, plain fringes, white cotton liners under the charmeuse skirt that shines so beautifully in the sunlight. That is where these wom en's imagination takes flight, and roses, rabbits, birds, little dogs and other domestic animals frolic on the fab ric in a wide range of patterns—cross-stitch, chain stitch, openwork lace and embroidery, all executed with great care. They buy the colored thread and the cotton cloth in Toluca or Zitácuaro, carefully choosing the thread hues for a proper blending of colors. "You have to do good work; there has to be harmony in the colors—never place an intense hue next to a pale one, that doesn't work. The pineapple has to be bright yellow, as well as the Sun; the deer should be brown, and the girl, pink." 3 ELENA PONIATOWSKA</page><page sequence="4">"Working on the street is a thousand times better than shelling corn, clearing the land, sowing and weeding, spreading fertilizer. All that is backbreaking work." In the Mazahua region, the silent land awaits. There is nobody left to manage the fields, to decide when to sell the crops or how much to sell them for, nobody to harvest the corn. Everyone has gone to the city. Gradually, the land has become more barren, harvest yields have gradu ally decreased; "When the sowing season is over, everyone goes to the city looking for work. Crop sowing is a peri odic process, but doesn't take long. The fields are plowed at the end of February, and again fifteen days later; sow ing can't take place until mid or late March. The second plowing is done to make sure the soil is properly loosened and no unbroken areas remain. We sow in April, but not that much—three, four days of sowing, that's it. It isn't much. Not like before." % Excerpted from the book Mazahua, with photographs by Mariana Yampolsky. Translated by Tai Fernández Struggle for Identity Homage to Julio Garduño Cervantes PAMELA SCHEINMAN Julio Garduño Cervantes (September 15,194o-Novem ber 16, 2007) adopted Mazahua culture as his cause. Collecting textiles (and ceramics), making photo graphs, painting and writing poetry—he authored the well-known anthem Soy Mazahua—he extended his fierce political activism into aesthetic realms. A born teacher and advocate, these objects became evidence of the values he upheld to future generations, a handy show-and-tell. Even the delicate "Tree of Life" pattern in ironwork on the facade of the modest house he kept in Toluca an nounced his solidarity and infectious delight. It echoes the embroidery on a tortilla napkin he owned from Villa de Allende. Born in Puente Andaró, abarrió ofTemascalcingo, in the northwest corner of the State of Mexico, near the bend of the Lerma River (Ndareje in Mazahua), Garduño wandered the same landscapes painted by native José María Velasco. At fifteen he began visiting Mazahua pueblos on foot. Then, radicalized by the 1968 student movement while at university in Toluca, he decided to return to the region to teach elementary school. Under the influence of Daniel Rubin de la Borbolla, he learned exhibition design and helped organize painting workshops for children. At the same time he worked for the emergent indig enous rights' movement. In 1974» delegates from the eleven predominantly Mazahua municipalities signed a declaration in Temascalcingo and elected the Supreme Mazahua Council, the first such organization in the State of Mexico, and among the first in the nation. Julio Gar duño was named secretary. By the following year, the Ist National Congress of Indigenous Pueblos joined repre sentatives of four newly constituted councils: Mazahua, Otomi, Tlahuica and Matlazinca. His volume An End to the Silence (1985) chronicles this rapid political consolida tion, gathering documents that he helped draft. Garduño not only traveled internationally as a spokes man at congresses in Paris, Ecuador and Peru, he also guided scholars, national and foreign, like Adolfo Co lombres. The Argentine anthropologist dedicated a chap ter of his book, Sobre la culturaji el arte popular (On Culture and Folk Art, 1987), to the Mazahua Ceremonial Center directed by Garduño. This center, located in Santa Ana Nichi, in the municipality of San Felipe del Progreso, was built in 1977 with support from then-governor Jorge Ji ménez Cantú. Three octagonal structures, clustered near a wide esplanade encircled by pine forest, embody one key goal of the movement: cultural preservation. On the first Sunday of each month, the Supreme Mazahua Chief performs rites in a space reserved for that purpose. The adjacent museum displays religious images, paintings, pho tographs and traditional Mazahua dress, including many items donated by Julio Garduño. Fine older quechquémetls (triangular mantles), woolen wraparound skirts, pleated satin outfits, embroidered shirts, pants and blouses, belts, shoulder bags and tortilla napkins adorn mannequins and shelves. Artisans exhibit and sell newly made items in the third building. An Exceptional Collection Garduño s collection records both his personal history and that of the movement. Many pieces were acquired as gifts or bought directly from their makers at meetings and festivals. For example, he owned several wide belts patterned with crows, flowers, stars and stylized double eagles in traditional rose, wine and black wool, made by Sofia Ferrer, who joined the Mazahua Women's Front formed in San Felipe Santiago, municipality of Villa de Allende, on February 15, 1981. Garduño's widow, Francisca F. Garcia Martinez, is the librarian at the Intercultural University in San Felipe del Progreso, another dream realized during Garduño's lifetime, that of bilingual education. When they met in 1981, she was wearing Mazahua garments—quechquémetl, blouse, wrap skirt and sash. She comes from Bombaró in Santiago Coachochitlán, in the municipality of Temascal cingo, where the Mazahua Youth Front was founded on March 17, 1988. By her own description, "embroidery is my mole de olla" (my specialty). In the Museum of Mazahua Culture hangs a black and-white photograph taken by her husband of a cape she stitched with brightly colored roses, lattices and two bor ders of undulating Mazahua vine. The collection also in cludes belts woven by Francisca and her mother, Genobeba Eufrosina Martinez. Garduño often praised the creativity of Mazahua de signs, which represent nature, their ancestral protector the deer (Mazahuas are known as "people of the deer") and the agricultural cycle. It was his belief that the motifs, 4 Tai Fernández■ PAMELA SCHEINMAN</page><page sequence="5">color and texture could all be read like a codex, an artis tic language, reflecting Mazahua women's surroundings, lives, feelings, sensibilities and dreams. One quechquémetl in the collection, for instance, bears the inscription "In remembrance of July 4&gt; 1973'" with deer on the left side, geometric stars and corn plants on the other, cross-stitched in a rainbow of colors. Another cape from the collection shows the Virgin of San Juan de los Lagos flanked by cherubim in the top reg ister; an elegant fuchsia flower with vine meandering in the center; and symmetrical pairs of birds framing flowerpots at the bottom (offerings to the Virgin). This style was from the San Francisco Tepeolulco area. Garduño commented; "There is an apparent repetition, but actually we see that the colors change. There's a variety of shadings, tones and colors that represent nature itself. These designs are very rich, but also exclusive to certain zones." A third cape, with geometric motifs characteristic of Santiago Coachochitlán, had the two woven sections joined by a band of needlework, over-stitched with a lat tice pattern thought to represent snakeskin. The snake is a female symbol associated with water. Garduño sug gested, "The serpent, for example, is a magic world of movement, of action." He added that the garment itself should be seen in movement, worn on a woman's body, for maximum effect. Like many, he considers textiles to be the Mazahua art form. His enthusiasm and great love for Mazahua culture led Garduño in many directions. In the 1980s he earned a degree in fine arts at the "La Esmeralda" National School of Painting, Sculpture and Printmaking. With Rubén Ruiz Piña, owner of a press in Temascalcingo, he co published a series of Spanish-Mazahua newspapers like Eco and Jyasú. He also served as official local historian journalist and author of a government monograph on the municipality of Temascalcingo. Garduño the chronicler witnessed firsthand the locality's important social, politi cal and religious events. Often his photographs, drawings or paintings enlivened his publications and those of oth ers writing on the region. Few individuals have combined commitment to in digenous rights with a focus on artistic expression. Julio Garduño Cervantes documented customs and dress over four decades, leaving a valuable record of what inevitably has changed or disappeared. Mazahua material is rare. His collection, currently being catalogued, remains both a testament to an optimistic spirit and a welcome home work assignment for all of us. ^ Layers of Identity Like Asphalt Flowers GABRIELA OLMOS I have come to know the Mazahua people as one knows their clothes: in layers. I first encountered sweet and luminous faces that gave way to brave, defensive women always ready to fight for their rights. Underneath, I found them to be pious; they lower their gaze as they offer prayers to the saints. They are also hard-working and supportive of each other. They have many other faces too that they reveal gradually. Time has a way of swaying human beings like the wind blowing against petticoats, constantly allowing us to see new facets, all different and surprising. But there is a trait that crosses through the multiple layers of the Mazahua women's spirit: their concern for aesthetics. These women seek to make everything more beautiful, even the church altar. The materials they use are modest: undyed cotton cloth, colored thread, flowers, popcorn and even animal-shaped cookies. It seems like they want to show us that imagination and dexterity are all that is needed to spruce up life, with a candor that inevita bly makes us smile—and smiling is the best weapon we have against day-to-day hardships. San Felipe Santiago: from Shy Laughter to Fierce Concern The loveliest thing about the Mazahua women of San Fe lipe is the way they laugh. They do so shyly, covering their mouth with the palm of their hand, as if trying to hold in their laughter, perhaps to avoid hurting anyone, perhaps so they may hold onto it forever. I saw them laugh al most as soon as I entered the village, hoping to videotape the celebrations in honor of their patron saint. They had gathered at the back of the church in order to cook: some of them were stirring immense pots of mole that reached above their knees, others were grinding corn on their metates (grinding stones) in a row on the ground form ing a most efficient production line, and the last group clapped the tortillas that would be placed on the griddle. There were so many women shaping the dough and they did so with such rhythm that their applause seemed to create a melody. "So you know how to play corn music?" I asked. They all laughed. I then asked for permission to observe their celebration, but they said that only those belonging to the community or helping with the celebration could be pres ent. That's when I offered to help with the cooking. Surprisingly, on the patron saint's feast day, the Maza hua women of San Felipe de Santiago cook wearing their most elegant attire—embroidered blouse and underskirt and a usually brightly colored satin dress, which are worn on top of each other to give the impression that they are dressed in layers upon layers—and none of them get stained with the mole sauce. I mentioned to them that in Mexico City we don't usually dress so elegantly when we cook, and that we didn't wear such pretty embroider ies because, for the most part, we didn't know how to make them. As they noticed that every time I spoke I stopped stirring the pot, they gave me a different responsibility so that the mole wouldn't stick, asking me to make tortillas instead. But they were even more disappointed: although I clapped and clapped the dough, I was never able to form anything even remotely close to a tortilla. 5 GABRIELA OLMOS</page><page sequence="6">"Hey, güera [white girl], you aren't married, are you?" One of them asked, certain of the answer. "No, Basilia, I'm still single," I answered. "So, what can you do?" "What do you mean what can I do?" "Well, what can you do if you can't make tortillas, can't embroider and don't have a husband?" I told her that, according to her parameters, she was right: I was a woman with no talents. As they giggled at me like children, I thought about how the truly impor tant things to the women of this community were those that "amused" them: cooking, embroidering, and fami ly. I had just crossed the first of many layers I was to go through in order to get to know the hearts of the Maza hua women. And so began the celebration in honor of the patron saint. For this festivity, one of the most important in the region, the men return to the village. Many live in Mexico City, where they do construction work, and many oth ers have emigrated to the United States. Therefore, San Felipe Santiago, like many other villages in Mexico, is mostly populated by women and children. In an attempt to adapt, these women have subverted the traditional male and female roles, and are now in charge of not only cooking and embroidering but also all other community chores. As one can imagine, the arrival of the men makes this celebration all the more important. The women's eyes give it away, gleaming in anticipation. This celebration also marks the change in mayordomia (community leadership). The outgoing authorities form a line and those who are to replace them form a line of their own. After dancing to a traditional melody, pow er changes hands through the symbolic placing of bread necklaces on the newly appointed. In San Felipe Santiago as in ancient cultures, bread is an offering and a symbol of authority, but the Mazahua people have managed to lend a touch of cheer to the solemnity, which is why the bread on their necklaces is baked in the shape of rabbits, bas kets and other quirky figures. Through this playful sense of the religious, so distinctive of Mazahua communities, I discovered yet another layer of the many that envelop these women's hearts. I returned to San Felipe Santiago years later during the celebration of the patron saint. I brought along pho tographs from my previous visit as a gift to the women who had been so welcoming to me. At first the pictures made them laugh and they seemed grateful. But when the men in town saw the photographs they were furi ous. They asked me to leave San Felipe and were afraid I was going to take these photographs to a Chinese-run sweatshop, where their designs would then be copied and mass-produced. I understood they were concerned about losing their income, and I tried explaining that although there were irresponsible people who did that kind of thing, I was not one of them. But I left town anyway. I had discovered an important new layer of the Maza hua spirit: that of a warrior people, ready to defend what is theirs, even against imaginary "Chinese" people who clearly symbolized the "other" that has been oppressing them for generations. Santa Rosa de Lima, Where the Language of God Is Spoken August 29 is the feast day of St. Rose of Lima, but in the Mazahua village named after her, the festivities be gin one week earlier, when children take their donkeys and go and pick the flowers that are used to decorate the village for the celebration. When they return with their precious harvest, families gather to cover light posts from bottom to top with flowers in colorful spiral designs. But the aesthetic madness does not end there: families make garlands with small bunches of flowers tied together with string that they then hang along the road leading to Santa Rosa. On the town's outskirts, there are only a few garlands lining the roadside. But as one approaches the center of town, they hang over the road, crisscrossing it like frail bridges, giving travelers the impression that the heavens are covered in flowers and that they are about to reach a veritable wonderland. The night before the celebration of St. Rose, people from surrounding villages arrive in a procession in or der to visit whom they affectionately refer to as the Virgen Rosita, associating her with their devotion to the Virgin Mary. Some of those making the pilgrimage bring along their own statues of saints in formal dress, which is an ex act replica of the community's most elegant attire. In this region, as in many other parts of Mexico, the world of saints also follows strict social norms, according to which each figure must be dressed elegantly before periodically visiting neighboring villages and thereby facilitating the establishment of ties among Mazahua communities. One can tell where the saints—and their followers— come from by their clothes. The formal attire of the Maza hua women of Santa Rosa includes a reddish brown wool quechquémetl with very little embroidering and a matching ¡(a (or skirt) traditionally woven on a backstrap loom. Each village uses a different color or decorative pattern. Thus, the subtleties of Mazahua clothes allow us to describe a ge ography where each design is a marker of identity. The celebration begins in the morning, when pilgrims congregate inside and outside the church, each group headed by its patron saint, in order to begin a proces sion towards the esplanade located at the entrance to the village along the road that leads to the highway. At first it appears to be complete chaos, and yet, incomprehensibly, everything suddenly falls into place and the groups begin walking under the flowery sky, guided by the sacred statues. Each party of women, following their own rhythm and in their preferred language—Mazahua or Spanish—sings their prayers to the "Virgen Rosita." But each group sings a dif ferent tune, creating during the celebration the most beau tiful interwoven design: that of the pious voices of women getting tangled in the air to produce a melodic chatter that must be akin to the language of God. Some of the locals wait for the saints in order to throw flower petals at them, the scent of which immediately blends with that of copal incense burnt by local authorities walking in front of and behind the saints. After the line of pilgrim women, the fervent men congregate in musi 6</page><page sequence="7">cal bands. They liven up the women's prayers with their music, both during the procession that leads down to the esplanade and during the procession that returns to the church at twilight. There are celebrations during which the aesthetic expe rience is so perfect it is almost painful, and that of Santa Rosa de Lima is one of these. Tears come quickly at the thought of it all being so fleeting: the music will vanish in the air, the flowers will wilt, the candles will burn out. All that will be left is the elegant clothes saturated with the smell of copal as evidence of those exceptional moments. That afternoon, as we returned in the procession towards the church, it rained. I believe that God and St. Rose of Lima were as moved as I was by the celebration. And that is how I discovered a few more layers to the spirit of the Mazahua women I got to know: that of refined and fragile beauty, and that of the poetry of the moment. San Felipe del Progreso: Popcorn Baroque At this point, after several trips, I thought I had gotten to know Mazahua women rather well. However, there was a surprising facet to their emotions and aesthetic awareness that I had yet to experience. It was during a visit to San Felipe del Progreso, seat of the municipal government, that I was privy to the more candid side of the Mazahuas' character: their "popcorn baroque." What tends to occur when you happen upon one of Mexico's ubiquitous baroque altarpieces is that you never tire of looking. And while trying to discern the hundreds of hidden details, you feel a joyful disorientation that leads to a kind of synaesthesia. That's when you get the feeling that you can touch things with your eyes. Whether the materials used in the altarpiece are costly or not does not matter. Indeed, it is more important that the altar piece was crafted with faith, than whether it is covered with gold or silver, because true devotion does not have to do with material wealth but rather with time invested in making the piece. How many hours does the craftsperson spend on one piece with the image of her devotion on her mind, in her hands and in her heart? Creating is a form of prayer. That is why, in such a space as the church of San Felipe del Progreso on the feast day of the Lord Jesus Christ, you cannot help feeling moved by that which is sa cred. And what is it about this exceptional place that takes our breath away? That the parish church's walls are cov ered with embroidered prayers, from the simplest napkins to the most elaborate altarcloths, that the space is deco rated with flowers and banners made of popcorn, that the statues of saints have strings of candy placed like necklaces around their necks and are given offerings of caramels, and finally that, in the courtyard, as a kind of offering in mo tion, people dressed up as Moors and Christians, concheros and shepherdesses dance together, crowning our experi ence of the sweetest form of baroque imagery—one that speaks the Mazahua language, one that uses the humblest of materials to create its overwhelming, dizzying aesthetics. The celebration of the Lord Jesus Christ is held on the third Wednesday of January, but in the Mazahua com munity of San Felipe del Progreso, festivities begin on the first Friday of the month, with the pilgrimage of the mayordomos de las ceras (or "caretakers of the wax") and their families to the La Purísima factory in downtown Mexico City to buy blocks of candle wax. When they began, these pilgrimages were done on foot. In their colorful dress, the Mazahuas must have looked like miniature rainbows moving through the now long-gone forests. During the nineteenth century, with the advent of the railway, the pilgrimage took advantage of the train as a more expedi ent mode of transportation. But the Mazahua's faith re mained intact and they held huge celebrations at the train station. Nowadays, the "wax mayordomos" travel by bus. Besides visiting La Purísima, the pilgrims go to Sonora Market to buy artificial flowers. Even though the decora tions they purchase may be entirely synthetic, their color ful beauty rivals the most idyllic fields of natural flowers. Their trek to the huge metropolis would not be complete without a visit to the Basilica of Guadalupe, so they may receive the blessing of the Virgin of the Tepeyac, along with their wax candles carried in wooden crates and their festive decorations. The return to San Felipe is cause for celebration, since the trek to Mexico City appears to "change " the spirits of the pilgrims. Upon their departure they are merely members of the community, whereas upon their return they are, as they themselves claim, "emissaries of light." For as long as anyone can remember, the pilgrims' return is celebrated with a procession. Then they all share food, along with the Lord of the Earth, Xonijomui, who is given a piece of tortilla as an offering to sate his hunger. After noon, once the Earth God has eaten, copal is spread towards the four cardinal points: each direction of the universe must be blessed so that light may come to the village. Each mayordomo, along with his family, is in charge of decorating the wax blocks transported in the wooden crates. In the past, the Mazahuas of San Felipe del Pro greso decorated them with flowers made by hand, roll ing colored paper around agave spines. But now they have brightly-colored artificial flowers from Sonora Mar ket, covered in droplets of silicone imitating morning dew. These wax-block and flower assemblages, along with cross-stitched napkins embroidered with the face of Jesus Christ, make up the portable altarpieces, almost six feet high, which are veritable marvels of religious art. Carry ing these offerings, the "wax mayordomos" make the pil grimage to the church of San Felipe and Santiago on the main square. They claim not to tire, though these wood en structures can weigh over sixty pounds, and the wind tends to offer resistance to those who are carrying them on their shoulders. But that is an element of faith, know ing how to control one's feelings. There are also "niche mayordomos." They normal ly decorate the figure of Jesus Christ that has presided over the church since the eighteenth century, using col ored ribbons, granadilla fruit and the ubiquitous popcorn necklaces that the Mazahuas place as offerings of the first 7</page><page sequence="8">grains of corn to "He who had the benevolence of allow ing them to harvest." And little by little, the church and the main square be come a sort of living prayer: some townsfolk bring offer ings of flowers, others have made the journey to church on their knees, others yet spread copal, and there are even "fireworks mayordomos." One cannot avoid smiling be fore so much beauty, and seeing that it is crafted with the most modest of materials gives us hope. The aesthetics of Mazahua celebrations teach us an ethical lesson: no prayer remains unheard and no struggle is won without a great deal of communal effort... and quite a bit of popcorn. As one leaves the celebration of the Lord Jesus Christ in San Felipe del Progreso, it is clear that all the energy spent there is for a reason. The locals are certain that on that day, notwithstanding the festive ruckus, those who open their hearts and prick up their ears can hear him: Xonijomui, pleased with the offerings, speaks from the heart of the Earth, stokes the fire of life and illuminates us so we may go on with our everyday lives. And so, during the celebration of the Lord Jesus Christ in San Felipe del Progreso, I discovered a new, intimate layer to the spirit of the Mazahua people: that of vital religious syncretism, of embroidered prayers, of the ba roque offering of plastic flowers, popcorn and cookies. We are sometimes so used to seeing Mazahua women in Mexico City that we don't even notice them. It's as if we had become familiar with their long, pleated, fiery-hued skirts and then had suddenly stopped looking. I imagine that every once in a while they notice this and stifle the pain they feel at this indifference by telling themselves that they don't care. But after having gotten to know them a little and looking at them and the many emotional layers superimposed in their clothing and their hearts, one can not help rediscovering them with astonishment: when they walk through the city they are like colorful flowers, thou sands of petals that continue to grow in the asphalt.

Ritual Identity Temascalcin^o' s Xita Corpus MONICA FERNANDA RUIZ CASTRO Temascalcingo is a small municipality in the north western area of the State of Mexico, bordering the municipalities of Acambay, El Oro and Atla comulco, and the states of Querétaro and Michoacán to the west. Its 6o OOO inhabitants present a multicultural demographic, including Mazahuas, Otomis and Mestizos who share a 3 50~scluare~ kilo meter area replete with moun tains, lakes and rivers. The name of this town comes from a Nahuatl word meaning "place of the small temascal" (a pre-Hispanic sweat lodge). Here, myths of origin have become traditions re enacted at festive gatherings held year after year with the involvement of the entire community. Xita Corpus is the most important of these: an ancient myth of pre-Hispanic origin that is continually re-signified and updated. According to the myth, the Xitas are the an cient people of remote times who have come to Temascal cingo after walking for many days. On their arrival they ask the authorities for permission to stop and rest after their long journey. They beg for a bit of food because they have only eaten wild animals and plants along the way. But there is no food available, so the townspeople plead with them to bring the rains that have been so long in coming. With their dances, the elders summon the rains, invoking the land's fertility and a good harvest. This invocation is performed during the Catholic feast of Corpus Christi. The rite is linked to the agricultural cycle, specifically when rain-fed corn is planted. Though corn cultivation is no longer the most profitable eco nomic activity in Temascalcingo, it remains the commu nity's "social and symbolic core, the symbol of cultural continuity, what holds the community together and pro motes communal life," according to Alessandro Questa Rebolledo and Beatriz Utrilla Sarmiento in Otomies del norte del Estado de Méxicoy sur de Querétaro. Preparations for the ritual begin a few weeks before the event, when the religious authorities of each district care fully select the local residents who will personify the el der man and woman: the father and mother, the seminal couple responsible for guiding and representing the com munity in the procession bearing their saints' statues to the municipal seat. The "old men" and "old women" ac companying them are local people who volunteer to par ticipate. The Xitas—from the Otomi or Mazahua word for "old people" or "ancestors"—are usually played by young men, and they are free to choose the gender they will per sonify and which personality traits they will take on. Each participant is responsible for designing and creat ing his own costume, mask and accessories. The costume is made up of a combination of used clothing that has been muddied and cut into strips, which are then sewn together to fashion pants, skirts and jackets that appear worn and tattered. According to the myth, the ancestors arrived af ter a long journey from a distant place, and their cloth ing is dirty and worn from the cross-country trek. They also wear hats made from sticks or cardboard, and carry a "load" that includes different accessories reminiscent of the migrants of old—the Otomis and Mazahuas who trav eled with pots, griddles and crates strapped to their backs. Some enhance their costumes with a typical quechquémetl (triangular mantle), enaguas (petticoat) or faja (sash) in the regional style. The full costume weighs around fifty-five pounds, adding to the physical exertion of the dance, given that the "old men" and "old women" jump, dance and growl with a joy and vitality that strikes a contrast with their el derly appearance. They attach bells and aluminum cans to their feet to create a sound reminiscent of rainfall. As a ritual and transformational element, the masks al low them to identify with nature. They are made from the Clara Marin. MÓNICA FERNANDA RUIZ CASTRO</page><page sequence="9">dried trunk of an agave, carefully carved using simple tools such as knives and chisels to create the wrinkled lines of an elderly face, and further adorned with gray hair and beards made from muddy ixtle fiber. The masks are gender- and age-differentiated: there are old men and old women, "middle-aged old people" and "old chil dren" as well. The Origins of the Xitas' Costume The ritual elements of the costume and the mask are charged with the sacred and religious significance of Mother Na ture; they attest to the pre-Hispanic symbolism and Catho lic imagery which present-day Otomis and Mazahuas have inherited, resulting in one more example of the cultural blending that has resulted in what we know as la mexicanidad, or Mexicanness. As far back as the Spanish Conquest, Fray Diego de Du rán spoke of these dances and the costumes used: "There was another dance of old people, where the dancers wore masks of old people, and danced hunched over in a man ner that was more than a little amusing and laughable in its own way." Huehueteotl and Temazcaltoci are ancient gods from the Mesoamerican pantheon, represented with "beards dyed with a black resin named ulli," according to Fray Bernardino de Sahagún in Historia general de las cosas de la Nue va España. The Xitas conserve this characteristic in their masks: the hair and beards decorating them are blackened with dirt and cow dung. Similarly (according to Yolanda Lastra in Los otomíes: Su lenguaj su historia), Otontecuhtli—the warrior god of fire who guides the Otomis on their long pilgrimage from the cave of Chiapa to Tlaxcala—appears in the Mendoza Codex with a huacalli or carrying-basket, just like the old men and women of the Corpus ritual, who are all beings in transit. With the arrival of Catholic friars in New Spain and the subsequent introduction of their religion, new ele ments were incorporated into the Xita Corpus costume. On Corpus Thursday, in an act of Christian solidar ity, the owner of the Solis hacienda—the largest one in the Temascalcingo region—gave all the servants and laborers the day off so they might enjoy the festivities. He would also give them a young bull, so they could organize bull fights, following which they would slaughter and cook the animal. The hacienda owner, his family and ranch man agers would give their old clothing to the Indians so they could dress properly for the event, but the Indians felt ri diculous wearing such finery with their old leather sandals, so they preferred to turn it into a satire, a festive protest, accepting the boss's charity but then shredding the cloth ing, cutting it into pieces and turning it into dance cos tumes. This is the origin of the tattered clothing worn dur ing this ritual. The Indians would then accessorize their costumes with masks of old men and women, carved out of agave trunks or wood. It is this atmosphere of satire and Catholic jubilation that justified the use of masks, costumes and dances re ferring to the ancestors' agricultural festivities and cel ebration of the fire god. In time, these dances established themselves as the Xita Corpus tradition, held every Cor pus Thursday in Temascalcingo. Constant economic, cultural and social change grad ually transformed the ritual and accompanying costumes. Descriptions provided by several town elders tell dif ferent stories about the evolution of the Xita costume. Luisa García, from the Calvario district, remembers her parents going to the municipal seat to get used cloth ing, which they would shred and sew to make costumes resembling tattered garments. Other people from the neighborhood claim that the Xitas only wore white cloth ing made from homespun cotton and a small sombrero woven from palm, which was the traditional attire of rural people in that period. As for the mask, most elders agree that it has always been made out of agave trunks, but also out of coral tree, for its lightness and flexibility. Animal masks made out of leather and wood are used on occasion. When plastics became pervasive for a whole range of household products in the I97°s&gt; rubber-latex masks be came popular, representing the ideal of female beauty as seen in Mexican movies and on television: women with smooth white porcelain skin, bright red lips and almond eyes with blue eye shadow, replacing the wrinkled, tooth less "old women" of the past. With their fantastic imagery, science fiction movies pro duced in Mexico and abroad also helped to transform the concept of "ritual clothing" into "costume." Little by lit tle , participants began utilizing wrestling masks or werewolf, witch, monster, robot and astronaut costumes. Young men playing the role of old women would wear skirts, stockings and blouses, and excessive make-up after the fashion of prostitutes or dance-hall girls. More recently, there have been references to politicians such as Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Andrés Manuel Obrador and George Bush. Faced with this massive transformation of traditional practices, people began to complain that the ritual had become a "carnival," and that a "return to tradition" was needed. It is interesting to note that Pamela Scheinman, a researcher at Montclair University, discovered key similari ties between European rites of spring and the costumes of the Xitas, primarily the cucurrumachos of the Navalosa Carni val and the jarramplas of Cáceres, both in Spain. At these car nivalesque festivities, participants wear costumes made from strips of fabric and bells that recall the sound of rain. They behave in a very mischievous and festive manner to mark the difference with usual everyday behavior and social activities. Mazahua and Otomi community elders and authori ties embarked on a laborious process of recovering the costumes and masks of "the ancestors." With the help of the regional branch of the José María Velasco Cultural Center and the municipality's administration, a proposal was made nearly two decades ago to purge all foreign in fluences that did not correspond to ancestral traditions. A contest was held to promote the use of the traditional costume and other ritual practices, allowing local cuadrillas or dance troupes to stage a return to the original tattered costume and agave mask. 9</page><page sequence="10">However, the recovery of this costume has not dimin ished Temascalcingo craftsmen's capacity for invention and creativity, as they have incorporated a number of natu ral elements from the surrounding area into their work: prickly pears, agave leaves, tree bark, corn husks, shells, shrubs, feathers and sticks are all used to create innovative accessories that embellish the traditional costume, along with elements that reflect participants' trades, aspirations or origins (for example, builders use cement bags, while fishermen use nets). Despite the scarcity of agave in this region, artisans have risen to the challenge with great creativity, utilizing the cardboard liners of cement bags as the backing for their masks. With great skill, they apply cow dung, straw and syn thetic paint to mimic the texture and shape of agave trunk. Xita Corpus costumes and masks are like "shells" that become charged with ritual meaning during the dance, but at the same time they are a portrait of the life expe riences of the person wearing them. Migrant workers who have gone to the United States incorporate motifs such as American license plates and English words, thus reaf firming their dual identity: their identification with the past and their ancestral origins on the one hand, and their acceptance of the new social reality on the other, thus demonstrating the stature they have earned in the community as migrant workers. In this manner, the old men's and old women's Xita Corpus costumes have persisted as the form and sub stance of the historic past, bearing witness to the ritual's cultural evolution and the aspirations and experiences of the people who celebrate it. ^ Translated by Michelle Suderman. Woven Identity The Art and Symbolism of Mazahua Sashes IGNACIO VÁZQUEZ PARRA Mazahua women have a great deal of respect for their traditional costume. It has concrete mean ings and specific values according to their cus toms. Each garment making up the costume—blouse, chin cuete (skirt), underskirt, apron, rebozo (shawl), quechquémetl (triangular mantle) and in particular, the faja or sash—has its own intriguing interpretation, because each one per sonifies a different part of the body and enhances the proud bearing of Mazahua women. The sash, known as faja in Spanish and mbutri in Maza hua, is one of the most fascinating expressions of this eth nic group's textile art. This ancestral garment is normally wound around a woman's waist, widely believed to be an energy center related to the cosmos and Mother Earth. Women who wear it create a sacred space that exerts a for mative influence on their psyche. In addition, the use of the sash is an identifying mark that strengthens an indi vidual's sense of belonging to her group or family. Sashes are especially important among Mazahua com munities. Through these garments, the weaver creates and develops a communication system that allows her to share ideas, dreams, stories, feelings and experiences through symbols woven into the fabric. A number of American indigenous groups, including Peruvian Quechuas and Mexican Huichols, have utilized sashes as living codices that allow them to pass down se crets of great cultural value from generation to genera tion. This was also the case of the women of the county of Jiangyong in Hunan province, China, who used the Nüshu script (literally, "women's writing") to communi cate through embroidered sashes and other items as they were forbidden to learn to read and write. Mazahua women utilize weaving to communicate their worldview and sense of fantasy. For example, the rich vari ety of birds portrayed on their garments are allegories for beauty, freedom and grace. Ancient bird designs or pájaras viejas, the classic jyans'e, the tsi'i or the mysterious ka'a bird, among others, evoke nostalgia for the weaving of their grandmothers. But how can we read the messages written on Mazahua sashes? Which are the most commonly recurring symbols on these garments? Birds are certainly one of them. One might say that they act as a kind of herald, announcing with their song the changing seasons and their migrations, and wel coming the Sun each morning. Their calls evoke varied hues of light and the changes of the natural world. When a bird is portrayed with a thorn in its neck or leg, one can assume that the weaver is experiencing some kind of physical or spiritual pain. The image is accompanied by other symbols that focus or intensify that meaning. Mazahua thought pays particular attention to move ment, as did the philosophy of ancient Mexicans, which recognized it as a fundamental quality of matter. Many cultures share a single symbol for movement: a design known in Náhuatl as ilhuitl, which is linked to the Sun. Mazahua weavers include it in their textiles to represent the dust kicked up by animals as they walk, and also to de pict happiness, the wind "playing" with the clouds, flow ers and plants, or fire dancing to the rhythm of the wind. It is a frequent symbol in Mazahua textiles, and it appears alongside other symbols that particularize a given com position's meaning. For example, when accompanying a heart, it means that the organ is beating; when it is wo ven along with the symbol for Venus, Danseje, it refers to a star that shines in the night because of the Sun, known as jyadi. The Mazahua star is another symbol commonly used on sashes. It is the guardian of the night, the messenger, the king of darkness, but above all, the protector of health. This is a design of great beauty, but cannot compete with the Sun motif, which is rarely seen on these garments. The reason for this is that permission must be asked before weaving it, because it is believed that its enigmatic presence and power should remain in the sky. As such, women who are able to weave this motif do so for a special reason. Moreover, it is a very difficult motif to weave, and it would be unforgivable to do shabby work on such an important design. 10 Michelle Suderman. IGNACIO VÁZQUEZ PARRA</page><page sequence="11">If a woman is going to weave the Sun motif on a sash, she places a diamond shape at its center to symbolize the "house of jyadi," the most mysterious abode of the Sun. The Sun is represented on Earth by fire, which warms hearths and homes and is capable of transforming and purifying things. Fire (sivi in Mazahua) is the loyal ally of the wind (rama), an invisible being that roams the world freely, a tireless traveler that brings with it life and death. Of all the elements in nature, earth is the one that appears most frequently on Mazahua sashes. Its symbol is very similar to that of fire. The fertility of the Earth (jomii) and the Sun in eternal betrothal is what gives meaning to life. In Mazahua culture, the seed and the sown field are represented by abutting diamonds that symbolize fer tility. This symbol should only be woven after including the earth motif, which is the design with which Mazahua women generally begin and end their weaving of a sash. Mazahua weavers are aware that life is the union between the plant and animal worlds, which together with the power of the cosmos form the tapestry of all existence. The territory inhabited by the Mazahuas is known as Mazahuacan, which means "place of deer" in Náhuatl, and indeed, the image of this beautiful animal is pervasive in Mazahua weaving. Deer are often given a place of honor on sashes: an image of a woman riding a deer symbol izes displacement, migration, but above all, it represents a mythic journey, because only an adult woman can ride a deer. Young girls are shown riding donkeys or horses be cause they are incapable of taming a deer. The only anthropomorphic figure on some sashes is that of a woman. The so-called diseño de muñeca ("doll de sign") makes it clear that women are the central characters in the highly personal mode of communication that is textile weaving. Mazahua women are equally skilled at weaving other important motifs, such as agave plants, Trees of Life, beasts of burden, domestic animals grazing, the markings on a snake's skin, flowering paths, as well as abstract al legories, lines and colors indicating territoriality, life sto ries and imaginary animals. As we can see, Mazahua textile art inhabits a limi nal territory between imagination and reality. The tra ditional costume as a whole and especially the sash are closely tied to Mazahua culture, and are the loyal accom plices of social transformation. Translated by Michelle Suderman. Threatened Identity The Storv of an Endangered Mazahua Traje SHERI BRAUTIGAM A troupe of older women with hats that made them look like living flowerpots slowly entered the San JL JL_Felipe del Progreso church in solemn proces sion. As the women are short and I am tall, the spectacle hit me strongly in the middle of my chest, at heart level. The place was filling with pilgrims from the countryside carrying their flowered and beribboned arches and shrines of their saints and virgins. A group of musicians followed, playing instruments loudly and out of tune. The almost deafening cacophony of sound was bouncing off the walls. It was the feast day of San Felipe del Progreso, and neighboring vil lages were bringing their religious figures to be blessed in the large cathedral. The whole church was filling with groups, all intent on getting to the altar. But in the middle of this chaos, there were two rows of calm, beautiful grandmothers wearing straw hats—covered with huge colorful paper flow ers—and quechquémetls (triangular mantles) of brilliant indi go-blue wool trimmed in orange and red embroidery. They were a bright sea of calm in the center of religious fervor." This describes my first impressions of a rare Mazahua wool traje (traditional dress) and the emotional incentive for pursuing information and developing a relationship with a revitalization project, Flores Silvestres (Wildflowers), in the village of Santa Rosa de Lima, El Oro, State of Mexico. One of my greatest satisfactions in collecting in digenous textiles has been to visit the villages and meet the artisans who are making them. For more than thirty five years I have followed this trail in Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. It is not usual for me to have such a strong first impression, like the aforesaid one, which then propels me to experience a living textile tradition in greater depth. The Flores Silvestres Recovery Project I had no contacts when I drove to the high-altitude village of Santa Rosa de Lima with a sweeping view of the high plain of the State of Mexico. I anticipated an afternoon outing, or at least an adventure, so it was a pleasant sur prise to be directed to the Torres family home by a help ful woman in the local pharmacy. She told me there was a group of women meeting on Saturdays to learn the skills necessary to create their traje. I had missed the Saturday session but the coordina tor and initiator of the project, Regina Torres Ramirez, although unprepared to see a stranger on her doorstep, brought out all her natural dye materials. She demon strated the use of her malacate (spindle) and showed me her yarns. She then dressed her young daughter in the cochineal-red quechquémetl and the large hand-woven striped wool skirt of blue, red and orange called a lía, and encouraged me to take pictures. The skirt weighed at least eight pounds and was 12-5 codos (measurement from el bow to tip of the middle finger) in length, or about six yards, and was beautifully embroidered at the hem and waist with fine white wool yarn stitching. I eventually learned that traditionally a young woman was given one of these skirts, which she wore for her entire life, adjusting the fit and length with a faja (wide hand-woven sash) to the changes her body would go through. I was invited to return to document the next Satur day session of the Flores Silvestres project, which was ini Michelle Suderman. SHERI BRAUTIGAM</page><page sequence="12">tially sponsored in 2008 by the INI (National Indigenist Institute) agency in Atlacomulco, with a small grant for materials. This session was devoted to urdir, or setting the warp threads for the skirt that would eventually be woven on a telar de cintura or backstrap loom. The women sat in a group on the ground under an orange tarp and gin gerly handed the yarn to the next person to place around smooth dowel-like stakes in a U-shape. This group con sisted of four women who were part of the project, with some young girls who were their relatives, watching. They gossiped and joked with each other while Shakira played in the background. They continually referred to an older skirt, which they kept holding up for reference, in order to see the color sequence of the stripes. They then held up a length of the skirt fabric to show me the eighteen-foot length. In the final product, two of these lienzos or lengths of cloth (from which, according to Regina, the word "lía" is derived) would be sewn together to lend this long and very heavy skirt its required width. The following session was devoted to hand spinning. They worked with local wool that they had thoroughly cleaned and taken to a factory in Toluca to be turned into a soft roving, eliminating the time-consuming carding pro cess. The older women were showing a few of the young girls how to twirl the spindle. I failed miserably at this task, as I could not get the "push-off" action coordinated with my thumb and second finger to create a twirl in the spindle. Regina then took me to the home of Rosa Alvino de Jesús, a woman around forty years old, and one of the re maining twenty backstrap weavers in Santa Rosa de Lima. She had just begun the process of weaving a skirt length, and the warp stretched across her entire yard. With the weight of this eighteen-foot wool warp, the upper body strength required to keep the tension seems extreme in the beginning, but lessens as the cloth is woven and rolled onto the end bar of the loom. Because of the needed physical strength, and the cost of materials, not many women are carrying on the labo rious weaving tradition of Santa Rosa de Lima. Many of these skills are very close to disappearing as the daughters of existing artisans are not taking up the craft, but are instead moving to Mexico City. There is also a tradition that craft skills are passed down from mother to daughter, kept within the family, and not shared with neighbors. Luckily, Regina Torres decided that she would initiate this revitalization project with the goal of continuing to foster a strong sense of identity through the traditional Santa Rosa de Lima traje. Her mother Maria was a very skilled artisan in embroidery and finishing of the quech quémetls. Regina had enlisted other women, like Rosa, to share their spinning and weaving skills. There are many stages in making a lía or a quechquémetl, so people tend to have specialized in one or two: spinning, dyeing, weav ing, or finish embroidery. Wildflowers as Natural Dyes On my last visit to the project I saw the natural dyeing of wool yarn; añil (indigo blue), cochinilla (cochineal insect: pink/red), flor silvestre (wild marigold; yellow) and musgo (Cuscuta americana or dodder: yellow green) are the colors used in the Santa Rosa de Lima palette. These are all natu ral plant products, which require a hot dye bath along with various mordants (fixatives) to set the colors in the wool yarn. However, in the case of indigo, there is instead an oxidation process in which the wool is allowed to "air" to intensify the color between dye baths. Indigo dyeing was of particular interest as they were using orines de niños (chil dren's urine, untainted by chemicals or drugs) for the fix ing process. This requires the wool yarn be placed in five gallon plastic buckets or ceramic jars outdoors, because of the intense smell. The indigo process lasts from four to twenty-one days, depending on the depth of blue de sired. Daily oxidizing of the wool entails pulling the yarn out of the buckets or jars and placing it in the sun—on an agave-plant "clothesline"—for a few hours. All natural in digo dyeing is done during the warmer months of March through June, or until the rainy season begins. Santa Rosa de Lima is located at a high altitude—3200 meters above sea level—and is cold most of the year. Indigo requires a warmer temperature to fix using the older, traditional urine fermentation process, as this technique does not use an external fire. The spun wool was wound on the back of a chair to separate it into madejas (hanks), and then weighed on a scale into five-pound bundles for each dye bath. A fire was set in the yard and a large ceramic vessel with lime juice (a mild acid) and stannous chloride was put on it to boil, while the cochineal bugs were ground into powder on the metate (grinding stone) and then added to the hot liquid. Four women with long sticks stood around the fire and dropped the five-pound bundles of white yarn into the simmering pot, pushing and stirring continuously so that the dye would be evenly dispersed. After about twenty min utes it was determined that the color was deep enough, and the yarn was lifted out in unison by the sticks into another ceramic vessel. The yarn was a dark pink color. More lime juice and cochineal were added to the boiling ves sel, and another hank of white yarn was dyed for a short er period of time. This time the color produced was a bright light pink. The next dye baths involved "over-dyeing," or a mixture of colors. The same vessel on the fire received more in gredients, in this case, wild-marigold petals and more ground cochineal. The previously dyed dark pink hank of yarn was dropped into the vessel. All four women stirred again, working together. This time the color produced was a bright orange that they called rojo (red). A final dye bath with more wild-marigold petals added to the same vessel, and insertion of white yarn, produced amarillo (bright yellow). The last bath was a fresh mixture of lime, stannous chloride, and cochineal into which a hank of previously dyed indigo-blue yarn was stirred, producing an azul ma rino or deep navy. This was the color of those first quech quémetls that had impressed me months before, worn by elderly women pilgrims in the nearby San Felipe del Pro greso church. 12</page><page sequence="13">On August 28 and 29, 2009, I was invited to the fiesta patronal (patron saint celebration) of the village of Santa Rosa de Lima. The first day, girls of all ages from the various neighborhoods carried pictures of virgencitas (the Virgin Mary), singing her praises, in procession through the vil lage streets festooned with garlands of fresh flowers. It was also the day when everyone wore full traditional traje if they had one. Surprisingly, many adjustments had been made to the red or blue wool quechquémetls and long striped wool skirts. Now, more than half the girls wore the much lighter acrylic skirts, store-bought in El Oro, that mimicked the fine blue, red and yellow stripes of the originals. From a distance, they appeared hard to differentiate. I also saw several polar fleece quechquémetls and other brightly striped acrylic fabrics being used. But most girls had bor rowed traditional ones from their relatives. Some were very old and threadbare. Then a wonderful melodic song filled the air as the grandmothers' group passed by singing in Mazahua, with their hats covered with flowers and long ribbons flutter ing behind. They wore their authentic quechquémetls proudly, and I deeply hoped that next year there would be some new outfits produced by the Flores Silvestres revitaliza tion project. Recovered Identity The Mazahua Crescent-Shaped Earring PAMELA SCHEINMAN The artist Ofelia Murrieta says that "crescent-shaped earrings may be related to ancient female deities. According to the Arab definition, al-karrat means pendant [...] They arrived in Mexico with Spanish women, along with lockets, milagros, coins and crystals set in beautiful necklaces or wrapped in silver and gold thread, and came to be worn by indigenous and Mestizo women. They later took root in local tastes and spawned new forms in each region." In the Mazahua area, almost all women wear silver cres cent-shaped earrings. The custom is for a man to buy his fiancée a pair, instead of an engagement ring. The groom takes silver coins to a master silversmith who makes the ear rings with a hammer and chisel. The technique is still tra ditional and the silversmiths guard their secrets. When one of them dies, as happened with a silversmith in Temascal - cingo, the tradition is lost. Conscious of this loss, Maria Teresa Pomar (1919—2010), an educator and folk art specialist, accepted the invitation extended by Governor Carlos Hank González to work at the Casa de Artesanías (House of Crafts) of the State of Mexico, which she administered from 1969 to 1975- ^n~ terviewed in 2009, she recalled: "There were four or five silversmiths, all of them poor. The main group was in San Felipe del Progreso. We went to see them and began our research. They worked with a blowtorch with a small met al tube they had to blow into. And they only had one hand to work the silver. That's how they heated the metal. We taught them how to use a pedal blowtorch so both their hands were free. That was the first step. Then we asked them to make arracadas, those same [crescent-shaped] ear rings without changing anything, just like the ones worn by Mazahua women." The technician in charge of the project was Eduardo Dagach, a young Chilean who arrived in Mexico City in 1967 with a group of students from the University of San tiago and decided to stay. He brought along some exam ples of his work in silver to the prestigious Victor Arte Popular store-gallery downtown. The owner, Víctor Fo sado, made reproductions of antique silver jewelry and his son Victor, a talented artist, had his workshop next door. Pilar Fosado says that her brother Victor invited Dagach to share the space, and that's how he met a lot of people. It might have been Alberto Beltrán who put him in touch with Maria Teresa Pomar. She suggested that he go look ing for the silversmiths in 1971• Every Sunday, Gregorio García Ruiz sold his merchan dise in the market at San Felipe del Progreso. As a young man, he had been granted a plot of communal land (or ejido) of 1.3 hectares when President Lázaro Cárdenas re distributed the land owned by the Tepetitlán hacienda. His father painted churches, and in Tlalpujahua, he met a sil versmith from Contepec, Michoacán. "Would you teach my sons?" he asked. Filemón García began to train Grego rio's brother Faustino and his two cousins, Felipe and He siquio. That's how he learned the trade: "Just watching and watching, that's how I learned. When they went to San Fe lipe to sell their goods on Sundays, I stayed at the work shop. It was just Mazahua crescent-shaped earrings, that's all they made. So I thought, 'Let's see if I can do this.' But unfortunately, just as I learned to make the earrings, my brother drowned in the river. If I hadn't learned out of curiosity, it would all have been forgotten then." Dagach found Gregorio García at the Sunday market place and said he wanted to buy a few pairs of earrings. Gregorio asked him: "Are you interested in how we make them?" Dagach responded he was very interested indeed. Then Dagach introduced Gregorio to Maria Teresa Po mar, who requested he teach a group of boys: "So that when you're gone, you leave something behind. I don't want this to be lost." She promised to get funding if he found an appropriate place. They had invited silversmiths from Mexicalcingo, Temascalcingo and Acambay, but Gregorio was the only one to accept their offer, and he began teach ing in a rented space next to the church in San Felipe. Faustino González Cordova was one of the twenty-five young men trained, all of them single and sons of ejidatarios (farmers of communal land). They practiced on copper and brass. 'We would make the pieces. If they didn't come out right the first time, we'd try again. We gathered up the ones that didn't turn out and melted them down." They learned the entire process systematically. "For example, if you want to learn how to make these crescent-shaped earrings, you have to first prepare the sheets of metal. In order to make filigree, you have to stretch the wire." PAMELA SCHEINMAN</page><page sequence="14">Once they had mastered the technique, they began making the pieces in silver. In the past, master silversmiths had used lower grade silver, 720, as well as the standard 900 (90%). The government bought the tools they need ed, and hired Jesús "Chucho" Monroy Alvarez, a silver smith from Toluca, to teach the young men how to use them. Monroy incorporated bell motifs inspired by the "Tree of Life" clay candelabras of Metepec. "We changed some details and put a bell at the bottom," says González. In 1974 a World Silver Fair was held in Mexico City. Artisans from Canada, the United States, Russia, France, Italy, England and several other countries entered, along with silversmiths from San Felipe del Progreso and Taxco. According to Maria Teresa Pomar: "We borrowed some money to buy the silver. We collected the work and pre sented it together through the House of Crafts of the State of Mexico. The Mazahuas won first place. Imagine that, an indigenous group! " González recalls: "They placed all the pieces we made on a large table and they gave the prize to the work in general, because these were designs no one had ever seen before—new designs. We won the national Luis Echeverría Alvarez award." The bell made by Chucho Monroy won third place, and a necklace made by Gregorio García also received an award. Gregorio García then went to Canada where he made a replica of his dove necklace, to show how he had made the winning piece. When he returned to Mexico, they showed his award to the governor. Hank González said: "This is an honor for the State of Mexico. What can I give you? What would you like?" Gregorio García answered: "It would be nice if you could give us a place to stay because we come from very far away." "Just let me know where to buy the land, " was the gov ernor's response. And Garcia answered: "No, we don't need to buy anything, we already have a piece of commu nal land. That's where we want to live." In any case, the government gave them a plot of land and construction materials to build a large workshop, the craft center. They contributed their voluntary labor—-foxite as they would say in Mazahua. Then they asked for their houses. And that is how the Colonia Plateros de Palmillas (or the Palmillas Silversmiths' neighborhood) was born. The golden years ended with the government of Hank González. The group got smaller due to dwindling fund ing. In 1982, a project was launched to preserve Monarch butterfly colonies in Mexico, and a necklace with butterfly motifs made by Garcia won first prize in a related contest. Two years later, the ten artisans who remained at the craft center won the State of Mexico award. The prize moti vated them to organize themselves legally as an associa tion. Gregorio García was elected president and Faustino González, secretary. The organization started off with ten members and grew to twenty-four. Maria Teresa Pomar had become technical director of FONART and then head of the Museo de Artes e Industrias Populares (the Folk Art and Crafts Museum). The Pal millas silversmiths delivered their earrings, necklaces and bells to the museum's store. They also made other designs in filigree, such as fans and miniature horse-drawn carts. In 1993, Gregoria Garcia resigned as president and the collective was restructured, calling themselves the Pla teros Artesanos Indígenas Unidos (or United Indigenous Silversmiths), with González as president. They later dis banded again. Nowadays each silversmith works on his own, training his family, making both traditional and original designs, and seeking out his own clients. González Cordova told me the story of Mazahua ear rings that he had heard, passed down through genera tions: "The stones symbolize the bright star that comes out at around four or five in the morning. The doves represent the husband going out into the fields to work, and his wife getting up to make atole. The flowers and leaves refer to the countryside, to nature. And the lines are the rays of the Sun." In the area surrounding Temascalcingo there is a dif ferent design. A silversmith living in this region used a technique called "lost earth"—similar to lost-wax casting, but using earth instead of sand. When he died, nobody continued with that tradition. Faustino González once stated: "In San Francisco Tepeolulco women wear long crescent-shaped earrings, quechquémetls and all the Maza hua garments. Their earrings have two, four or up to six doves on them. Most women have those earrings, and some of them have up to three pairs." González went on to say that local women really love them: "They tend to buy two pairs, in case one breaks. They're real fanatics for this type of earring." González traveled to Tepeolulco for three years. Ev ery Saturday he would show up in his beige Volkswagen bug. He would bring new earrings and also fix broken pieces. Then some colleagues of his continued the work: "But it wasn't the same. When the price of silver went up they started making them smaller to lower the cost. They made them with smaller coins (American dimes or Mexi can IO- or 20-cent coins), and made the doves smaller, too. Yes, they changed a little, but there was a time when women were dying for these earrings. They would say to me: 'Make me five pairs, [enough] for my entire family, and all the same style, that's it!'" * Translated by Clara Marin. Distorted Identity La India Maria: A Mazahua in Movieland MARICRUZ CASTRO RICALDE Maria Elena Velasco fortuitously came up with the character of La Inia Maria in 1972. but it was so successful at live performances that the ac tress was soon hired to recreate the role for television, in sketches on popular Mexican variety shows such as Siempre en Domingo. Here, having ostensibly fallen in love with the host Raúl Velasco (no relation to the actress), Maria pursued her giierito all over the studio, as the equally popular star of 14 Clara Marín. MARICRUZ CASTRO RICALDE</page><page sequence="15">the show fled from her in a routine that was a paradigm for the complicated relationship often occurring between two people of different classes and ethnic backgrounds. Un der the guise of a comedy act, La India Maria's admiration for her light-skinned costar and his veiled disdain toward her in fact served to legitimize the social order inherited from Mexico's viceregal period. Siempre en Domingo remained on the air on Televisa s flagship station, "El Canal de las Estrellas" (the most important channel in terms of number of viewers, advertising revenue and investment) for nearly thirty years. The program achieved its highest ratings during the period when Maria Elena Velasco was defining her character's place in the people's imagination. It has been calculated that dur ing this time, the program could reach a potential audience of as many as 400 million viewers on four continents. In 1979 &gt; Maria Elena Velasco and Gilberto Martínez Solares codirected OK, Mr. Pancho, and two years later, they teamed up again on El que no corre... vuela. Here, Ve lasco started to play a contributing role in developing the film's concept, storyline and script. It is significant that she decided to begin her career as a filmmaker alongside one of the preferred directors of famed comic actor Tin Tan. Some years earlier, she had worked with director Rogelio A. González, who had been a screenwriter and later a director for some of Pedro Infante's movies. She also collaborated with veteran filmmaker Miguel M. Del gado, who worked on thirty-three Cantinflas movies. This relationship with the mentors of the most impor tant comedie actors of the Golden Age of Mexican cin ema added weight to Vélaseo s previous successes as a va riety show performer, given that for many years, she had been a supporting actor with such popular entertainers as Adalberto "Resortes" Martínez, Jesús "Palillo" Martínez, Fernando "Mantequilla" Soto, Antonio "Clavillazo" Es pino, Manuel Medel and Eulalio "Piporro" González. In reference to Velasco's film Ni de aquí, ni de allá, the critic Nelson Garro wrote that La India María had "taken over the spot left vacant by Cantinflas." Maria Elena Velasco made the transition from mere ac tress to the coordinator of all her projects, from concept, storyline and scripts (collaborating with her daughter, screenwriter Ivette Lipkies) to direction and production (through her production company Vlady Realizaciones, led by her son Iván Lipkies, with her daughter as execu tive producer). This transition had serious repercussions, in terms of both cultural production and gender. There have been very few cases of women who have taken a leading role in film production in the history of Mexican cinema: Isela Vega, María Novaro, Marisa Sistach, Busi Cortés, Sa bina Berman, Dana Rotberg and Guita Schyfter, to name a few, have all written, edited, directed or participated in the production of films, but Velasco also starred in hers. Like the aforesaid women, Velasco has also involved her children in the production of her films, thus turning them into a kind of family business, like so many small businesses run by women in other sectors of the economy. In this fashion, they combine their roles as mothers, members of an ex tended family, and wage earners.The decision to collabo rate with filmmakers and other individuals who had worked with major Mexican comedy stars could also be viewed as a way for Velasco to gain access to a male-dominated industry. Her close working relationship with the directors Solares, Delgado and González supports the notion that she is heir to the comics of the Golden Age. It also allowed her to gain greater familiarity with the administrative side of filmmak ing (unions, relationships with the industry, production teams). Such factors even further spark our interest in familiarizing ourselves with the concept that Velasco pro posed in the projects where she decided to take the reins. The figure of the Mazahua woman fit in perfectly with the wide range of characters created by the old masters of vaudeville and popular comedy in Mexico and Latin America. As such, Cantinflas's peladito, or urban tramp, Tin Tan's zoot-suited pachuco and Piporro's impulsive norteño character of northern Mexico joined forces with the straight-talking india to complete the social panora ma of the nation's major cities. As the self-designated "prophet of disaster," the cornerstone of Palillo's sketches was his shrewd analysis of injustice in Mexico, brought on by corruption and the absurdity of politicians' decisions and conduct, and La India Maria's television appearances seemed to be a continuation of his critique of the coun try's political and social situation. Freedom of expression in Mexican mass media—especially in television—was ex tremely limited, given the close association between the government apparatus, the PRI (the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party) and the media industry. La India Maria's gaucheness, added to an ingenuity verging on foolishness, gave her free rein to engage in a bold discourse that was unusual for the time. In presen tations that fluctuated between na'iveté and waggishness, she often alluded to political corruption, upper-class ex ploitation of the working class, and recurring attempts to bamboozle the indigenous and rural populations, based on a widespread belief in their lack of intelligence. The character elicited a fervent response among working-class television viewers, and they showed their enthusiasm by putting her first two movies in third and second place respectively in terms of box-office receipts for Mexican cinema. In 1988, at a time when Mexican movies gener ally remained in theaters for about four weeks, Ni de aquí, ni de allá spent twenty weeks in the theaters, becoming the top earning Mexican movie that year, with box-office pro ceeds of $1 775 OOO pesos. This speaks of the popularity of Velasco's character among moviegoers in Mexico, and the same would be the case with her movies El coyote emplu mado (second-highest grossing premiere o f1983) and Ni Chana ni Juana (third-highest in 1985). Ni de aquí, ni de allá (1987) was thus an even bigger box-office hit than its predecessors. To understand the movie-going audience's positive response, it should also be noted that the film's central theme—illegal immigration—was a sensitive is sue among the segment of the public that had followed Maria Elena Velasco since her earliest television appearances. Pre vious movies about the mojados or "wetbacks" were unsuitable for children given their violent nature and overt or implied sexual content, whereas those starring La India Maria were designed for the enjoyment of the entire family. 15</page><page sequence="16">Embroidered miniature, Isabel Quijano collection. ■ £ Velasco played a Mazahua woman who, though naive, clumsy and somewhat clueless, was a hard worker with a big heart. She always dressed in traditional Mazahua cos tume from central Mexico, immediately calling to mind the many indigenous people who migrated to Mexico City due to the impoverishment of rural areas during the I97°s From this time forward, the urban landscape of the capital city was characterized by the presence of the so-called martas—Indian women who sold fruit (mainly oranges) in the streets and were thus christened because of the preva lence of this name among this segment of the population, attesting to the influence of Catholicism in indigenous and rural communities, a situation that becomes immedi ately evident in Ni de aquí, ni de alias opening scenes. Thus, Ni de aquí, ni de allá dealt with a twofold migration: both domestic (from rural to urban areas) and across na tional borders (from Mexico to the United States). Real izing that it wouldn't be enough to move from the coun tryside to the city to solve her financial problems, Maria decides to move to the United States, and thus intuitively attempts to avoid the "painful process" described by Juan Diez-Canedo Ruiz, given that "migrant workers move from a barely subsistence-level existence to one that greatly resembles—especially at the outset—the situation they just left." And it is a fact that the poverty experienced in Mexico is generally experienced again north of the border. Language, costume, cuisine and traditional medicine are facets of indigenous culture that La India Maria brings into the homes where she works in the United States, just as she had previously done in urban and suburban con texts in Mexico. The filmmaker thus creates an onscreen presence for a segment of the Mexican population that had remained on the fringes of the public domain, deal ing with issues such as marginalized ethnic groups and their participation in the labor market, while shedding light on the situation of undocumented immigrants and the mean ing of being Mexican when one is from "neither here nor there." Mexicanness ceases to be merely a topic for aca demic debate and becomes anchored in the adventures of a character that is anything but a traditional movie heroine. But despite their evocative titles, Maria Elena Velas co's films do not examine issues of identity and confor mity, or the question of who works for whom. The great paradox is that they actually serve to confirm and reiter ate certain stereotypes, especially in the case of Ni de aquí, ni de allá. The characters tend to be one-dimensional and the storylines are simplistic. Many of her films' spectators were more interested in "seeing themselves," in becom ing visible somewhere in the media, which rarely depicted them as protagonists, unless it was in association with some kind of drug scandal, death on the borders, or a conflict in Mexico-US relations. As such, the characters and situ ations portrayed by La India Maria received an enthusias tic welcome as cultural products that allowed the public to witness, understand or reenact situations that were a far cry from the pain and tragedy of the real world. The film revisits some of the most important facets of the indigenous experience as seen from a Western per spective, oversimplifying them and forcing them to adapt to certain codes that are used in the interpretation of their cultural diversity. What we already knew about these ethnic groups (their costume, cuisine, certain customs and ritu als) is reaffirmed, because the film's real objective is not to offer new perspectives that might raise questions as to com mon stereotypes. General knowledge and prevailing opin ions with regard to the different issues addressed in her movies (the root causes of emigration, the experience of the undocumented worker, the indigenous lifestyle, etc.) are exploited not to enrich them by questioning, modi fying or rejecting them outright, but in order to reaffirm them. Thus, viewers are merely meant to consume—rather than be critical of—the cultural product. But the reality of the wider world—that of daily hard ships, death at the hands of la migra, the coyotes, nature, gov ernment oversights—is barely present. On the contrary, these films present a much more comforting image: the experience of immigration as an adventure rather than a tragedy, offering an entirely new vision of the movement from one country to another and Mexicans' failed at tempts at becoming integrated in an alien culture. The return to the place of origin is bittersweet: La In dia Maria was unable to save up enough money to pur chase the much-coveted tractor. Her experience over the border is a mere parenthesis in a singular life, where the fact of being indigenous, illiterate and a member of a specific cultural group (Mazahua) in no way troubles the gaze of the spectators. In this sense, the movie deraci nates the spectators from the notion of historicity and hurls them into the limbo of cultural stereotypes. None theless, upon returning to her native country with newly acquired knowledge and trappings that combine tradition and modernity (Indian attire worn with running shoes, traditional Mexican music played on a modern tape re corder), Velasco's character offers an innovative perspec tive to the audience by embodying the ongoing negotia tion of cultural identity among those who migrate from the country to the city, or from Mexico to the United States as undocumented workers.
