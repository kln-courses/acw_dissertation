<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  N I N E   ( Infinite) Absolute Negativity :  The Brief Epics  To approach Blake's corpus in terms of sectors is to displace any genetic narrative (either of evolution or repression) that one might  construct because the texts follow each other chronologically. Each sec­ tor provides a perspective on the whole that inscribes rather than antici­ pates or surpasses the intentions of other sectors. Thus, the earliest texts  encourage us to experiment with the priority of individual experience  over systematic constructs . In so doing, they open canonical reading to  problems of cultural difference . In the brief epics , which more asser­ tively begin the construction of a canon, we are encouraged to play with  the absorption of difference into identity through the subsumption of  present into future. But here, too , the traditional hermeneutic pro­ moted by the later prophecies encounters metaphysical if not cultural  challenges. If Blake's work differs from earlier canons, it is in the fact  that his canon is not a preestablished structure but something that he  must create through evidence and consensus. The texts we shall con­ sider here are paradigms for the way the supplementary use of her­ meneutics in forming canonical values necessarily stimulates a certain  reflexiveness toward that project.  The brief epics differ from the previous texts in their renunciation of  an individual perspective in favor of an omniscient voice that tries to see  events both transcendentally and historically . Attempting to construct a  phenomenology of history, Blake sometimes brings present, past, and  future together in one text like The Marriage. But more often he deals  with them separately, in a concession that history cannot yet be put  together. These texts , however, are quite different from the final proph­ ecies . They lay the groundwork for a canon by implying their own con- 253  </page> <page sequence="2"> 254 The Supplement of Reading  tinuation in some further text and by thus making the part a sign of  some absent whole . But it is not until later that Blake introduces the  strategies typical of canon formation:  the exclusion of certain perspec­ tives and the incorporation of others as partial types of truth. Moreover,  the early poems are prophetic in wanting to move toward the future, but  this movement is hortatory rather than predictive because voice and  event are not fused . If Milton is more grounded in a personal narrative,   that is because Blake has withdrawn from the theater of history to what  (superficially at least) seems the more tractable stage of the self. The  early prophecies situate themselves in a historical world , that of Europe  in the late eighteenth century, and the abstraction of prophecy from  event or of voice from subjectivity is a concession to the unreadability,  perhaps the unmanageability, of history. Not only is the realization of  the vision adumbrated in The Marriage deferred,  its central principles  are also challenged : principles such as the attribution of the fall to  Urizen and to his imposition of boundaries, our power to repeal the  chaos we have created, and indeed the very possibility of organized  innocence. The insecurity of the secular scripture confirmed through  canonical reading is reflected in Blake's continued use of mobile forms  that make 'omniscience' no more than a perspective. Thus, at the begin­ ning of Urizen Blake assumes the stance of the Eternals , only to withdraw  them from the action. The Eternals thus emerge as an intent at transcen­ dence that Blake can do no more than inscribe in the text.  Europe: A Prophecy  Our discussion will focus on Europe and Urizen, so as to bring out how  they stimulate and displace the negative hermeneutic necessary to fit  them into Blake's canon. The text of Europe is assembled out of several  pieces : the narrative itself, a preludium, a title page, a design of a  Urizenic figure mapping the world with compasses, and a preface that  exists in only two copies. Superficially we may be reminded ofJ erusalem,  where each chapter is similarly introduced by a combination of a preface  and either a lyric or motto. But the later poem's preface draws the  reader into a space of authority, by characterizing the author we must  accept or reject. By contrast, the prefatory materials to Europe are like a  series of asymmetrical frames from which 'Blake' seems teasingly absent.  When he does represent himself, as the one who hears the fairy's song in  the preface, it is in a whimsical way that mocks our attempts to grasp  him. The text gives us its meaning as something that must be pieced  together but breaks and interchanges the frames that we might other­ wise use to give it its bounding outline. Its construction raises at the  </page> <page sequence="3"> (Infinite) Absolute Negativity 255  outset the question of interpretation, forcing us to  encounter problems  of structure before we hear the 'voice' promised by prophecy, and thus  suspending rhetoric and the powerful responses it arouses in epistemol­ ogy.  The simplest of the frames are the frontispiece and the title page . The  picture of the Ancient of Days, first in all but one copy, suggests that we  are entering a world of restriction. The title page with its description of  Europe as a 'prophecy' allows us to think of that situation as open to  change, a statement that things will change or that they should change.  In different proofs of the title page, moreover, the figure caught in the  coils of the serpent is Urizen or Los . 1 We thus enter the narrative at a  threshold between the actual and the possible. The narrative itself tele­ scopes all of Christian history into a few pages before precipitating itself  toward a climax of indeterminate import :  Then Los arose his head he reard in snaky thunders clad :  And with a cry that shook all nature to the utmost pole ,  Call'd all his sons to the strife of blood.  (E66 ; 1 5 :9- 1 1 )   To follow Erdman i n  interpreting the 'strife o f  blood' as a reference to  England's counterrevolutionary war against France is to read the poem  as a corrective satire . 2  To see the climax as representing the revolution  itself is more pessimistic, for it is not just Ore but also Los (clad in snaky  thunders that recall the serpent temple of Baconian science) who is now  internally bound in a cyclic entwinement with what he opposes . On the  referent of this phrase, deliberately obscured like the word 'prophecy'  on some copies of the title page, depends our sense of how 'Blake' reads  cultural history. That the poem encourages us to reflect on how we  construct a hermeneutics of history is evident in the way it interrupts its  mythopoeic style with neo-Hogarthian designs such as plate 7. These  designs make myth responsible to a world of historical detail and en­ courage us to apply it to specific events in the way that Erdman does. On  the other hand, the discontinuity between realistic and visionary seg­ ments makes us wonder whether myth can be used to read history :  whether it does not encounter an obscurity about which part of the  pattern relates to which event.  At the root of our uncertainty about whether a negative hermeneutic  can be used to bridge the gap between myth and actuality is the gro- 1 David V.

Echoing Milton's "Nativity Ode" but making the 'se­ cret child' Ore instead of Christ, the text turns Miltonic Christianity into  a cinematic horror show whose overblown figures explode it from with­ in. Parody obviously does not posit in any conventional sense, but wheth­ er it posits by negation and thus yields to hermeneutic reading is what  remains ambiguous. Richard Poirier distinguishes between a parody that  is "other-directed-by one writer against another or at the literary  modes of a particular period,"  and a much more recent literature of self­ parody that "shapes itself around its own dissolvents [and] calls into  question . . . t he activity itself of creating any literary form."3 Blake him­ self seems to be writing both kinds of parody, for if the prophecy satir­ izes Milton so as to make us reverse the catastrophe he has produced, it  also bitterly mocks The Song of Los with its celebration of Ore so as to  consume what it posits through negation . Moreover, it is unclear wheth­ er we can even make Poirier's distinction. Parody is fundamentally imita­ tion : whether one sees the imitation as cathartic satire or as obsessive  repetition, there is some kind of identification between the parodic text  and what it projects as other. While reducing what it mocks to a series of  empty forms, the parody itself remains locked in the same hollowness , a  mockery of itself. Thus we often wonder whether figures like Ore and  Los provide alternatives to Urizen or simply replicate the structure of  what is already a parody. At the same time parody, however self­ consuming, cannot but retain the trace of a belief in truth and origins  precisely because it is a form of imitation, although an iconoclastic one.  Parody mimes an ideology that has been reduced to a formalism. There­ by constituting itself as a reflection of a reflection, it also creates by the  very act of imitation the expectation of a positive source travestied by the  sources it discovers . That Blake conflates in the figure of Ore elements  of Satan and Christ is a thematic symptom of the ontological structure of  parody as a mode in which negation is not nonbeing but the ground of  coming-to-be. For the nativity evokes as an empty schema a pattern that  neither Ore nor Christ fulfils , and that pattern then becomes a shadow  that futurity casts upon the present, unsettling any identification of the  text as a prophecy of doom. To put it differently , parody does not posit  anything. But linked with prophecy , it may have the hermeneutic struc­ ture of what Kierkegaard calls infinite absolute negativity . Even as it  negates everything, it may ask the reader to imagine that it does so from  the standpoint of a truth that it does not yet embody.  Our first reading of the narrative is by way of the preludium, which in  most copies is unaccompanied by any further preface, and which thus  3"The Politics of Self-Parody," Partisan Review 35 ( 1 968) :  339.  </page> <page sequence="5"> (Infinite) Absolute Negativity 257   seems to  frame the rest of  the poem in  the voice of  the nameless shadowy  female. Reading it mimetically , we might see the prophetic bitterness of  the text as unable to do more than reinscribe things as they are . The  "nameless shadowy female" is a will that has not yet achieved representa­ tion. She first pictures herself as an inverted flower whose roots are  "brandish'd in the heavens" and whose fruits are buried in the earth  (E6o; i : 8-g) ,  recalling bitterly those flowers in Thel and Visions which  believed that being uprooted by experience could be joyful. Wrapping  herself in a "turban of thick clouds" and a mantle of "sheety waters"  (E6 1 ;  i :  1 2- 1 3) ,  she seems a figure similar to the Earth of Experience.  Like Earth, she sees her potential as stifled and sees life as an endless  cycle in which revolutionary energy bursts forth only to be stamped with  Enitharmon's "signet" in the "solid form" of things as they are (E6 1 ;   2 : 7- 1 0) .  Her lament provides a preview of the narrative that follows and  also, since she may be Blake's muse, a commentary on the poem's mode :  warped and inverted, turbaned in an imperious obscurity that folds  inward to an inner void , a "secret place" (E6 1 ;  2 : 1 8) .  To see the proph­ ecy from the perspective of the shadowy female is to accept its parodic  inversions as self-consuming rather than apocalyptic , and to deconstruct  the negative hermeneutic that parody seemingly offers . Fundamentally  obscure, the prophetic voice acknowledges its failure at representation  in the concluding image of secrecy and involution:  . . . I  roll inward &amp; my voice is  past.  She ceast &amp; rolld her shady clouds  Into the secret place .  (E6 1 ;  2 : 1 6- 1 8)  But even without the preface there are indications that a purely de­ constructive reading is limited . For one thing, the shadowy female ad­ dresses herself to someone who might think differently from her. She  poses self-justifying questions, asking why she should hope, given her  experience so far. She asks , "who shall bind the infinite with an eternal  band,"  thus constructing her statement of the paradox that necessarily  consumes the infinite over the recognition that there may be bands that  do not bind (E6 1 ; 2 : 1 3) .  Addressing herself nominally to Enitharmon  but also to some other voice that reproaches her for her premature  despair, she tacitly raises the possibility of reading the text of history  differently . Like "Earth's Answer,"  the voice of the preludium is unset­ tled by its dialogical emergence in relation to a more hopeful voice that it  can neither accept nor totally ignore. Moreover, the gender of the shad­ owy voice is significant. For in responding to it as specifically female, we  become aware that oppression and helplessness are not archetypal real- </page> <page sequence="6"> 258 The Supplement of Reading  ities ,  as her mythic language would have us believe , but aspects of the  way women are figured and socialized. We see that the female's predica­ ment is not preordained, and that she is a historical construction that  then constructs history in a certain way. To introduce the supplement of  gender is not, however, to produce a hermeneutic transfiguration of the  text, since gender (like history itself) is a reflexive category. Thus, we  may also recognize that what we would substitute for the female's con­ struction of history, namely, the image of a transcendental subject able  to cast off its mind-forged manacles , is equally a figure . As such, it may  be unresponsive to woman's experience of being helpless, as well as to  the self-doubt implicit in Blake's engendering of the prophetic voice as  female.  As important as gender to the marking of limits is Blake's segmental  construction of the poem. Segmentation functions somewhat like aphor­ ism in creating spaces between texts that act as frames which "magnify  the power of exaggeration within them but don't allow it to penetrate  beyond their confines. "4 In other words, the preludium is stopped from  functioning as the major premise in the poem's argument because its  voice is placed outside the text of the prophecy. To absorb this voice into  the subsequent text would be to naturalize it-a move that Blake arrests  by conspicuously isolating it from the rest of the narrative. He also  'ungrounds' it, for it seems to come from nowhere, to hover abstractly  like a state that we may pass through, but not to have the identity of a  person whose origins we know. While the voice has interiority and thus  pathos, we are displaced from an affective identification with it by the  fact that it has no exteriority . It  is almost impossible to visualize this  shadowy female who is first an uprooted plant and then (dis)appears in a  turban of clouds , who seems to originate from "out the breast of Ore"  but who then brings forth from her bosom the "howling terrors" and  "myriads of flames" that earlier seem to have produced her (E60-6 1 ;   i :  i ,  2 :4 ,9) .  The paradoxical genetic relationship between Ore and the  female creates a radical uncertainty as to the identity of this shadow who  is known to us only as a sequence of stylized responses (deracination,  turning inward, secrecy) .  I s  her despair the inevitable consequence of  Ore's destructive revolutions, or does her despair produce revolution in  such a way that it must be destructive? What, moreover, is her relation to  Enitharmon? She addresses her as though she were the victim of En­ itharmon's machinations, as "mother Enitharmon" and thus as the ori­ gin of her woes (E6o ; I :4 ) .  Yet her own role as mother of the howling  terrors, which is another name for Ore, parallels Enitharmon's role as  4Alexander Nehamas, Nietzsche: Life as Literature (Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University  Press, 1 985) ,  p .  23 .   </page> <page sequence="7"> (Infinite) Absolute Negativity 2 59  mother of Ore and raises the possibility that the shadowy female and her  mother are aspects of each other. The relationship between these char­ acters who intergenerate each other takes form in what Ault calls a  "causal loop," a "perspective transformation" in which temporal rela­ tionships are constantly transposed , such that something that precedes  an event suddenly comes into being only as a result of the event it  precedes. 5 Such loops bring to the surface of the text an undecidability  that can sometimes create openings . In this case the loop makes us aware  of the narrative as a transformational surface that keeps generating  voices and characters to explain itself, freeing us in the process from the  demonically cyclic explanation of history to which the shadowy female  ascribes the involution of prophecy . In other words, it makes us aware  that the narrative field of this poem is highly fluid, and that the perspec­ tive from which we structure it is capable of changing.  Nevertheless, if the preludium de-identifies us from its voice and thus  from a fatalistic reading of the prophecy, it does not really give us  another position with which we can identify, producing hope only nega­ tively as a disembodied space inside despair. What radically alters the  poem is the addition of the preface in copies H and K. Here Blake  overhears the song of a fairy sitting on a streaked tulip, carries him  home while gathering flowers on the way, and sets him down on his  parlor table, where the fairy dictates Europe. This whimsical attempt to  displace the shadowy female as the origin of the narrative begins with an  account of expanded perception:  Five windows light the cavern'd Man ; thro' one he breathes the air;  Thro' one, hears music of the spheres ; thro' one, the eternal vine  Flourishes, that he may receive the grapes;  thro' one can look.  And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth ;  Thro' one, himself pass out what time he please, but he will not.  (E6o ; iii : 1 -5)   We are sufficiently familiar with passages that speak of seeing eternity in  a grain of sand to assume that this must finally be the voice of Blake.  Thus, Leslie Tannenbaum links the fairy to the fairies and giants in the  preface to Jerusalem and argues that in substituting it for the traditional  Christian muse Blake continues his parody of Milton through a coun­ tergenealogy of morals. He returns to the vision of the Ancient Poets in  The Marriage who found "an immense world of delight" in the senses  (E35 ; 7 ) ,  and he dismisses as unnecessary the dualism of sense and spirit  that produces Europe's woes . From the view that the poem has as its goal  5Donald Ault, "Re-Visioning The Four Zoas," in Nelson Hilton and Thomas Vogler, eds . ,   Unnam'd Forms: Blake and Textuality (Berkeley : University of  California Press, 1 986), p. 1 1 1 .  </page> <page sequence="8"> 260 The Supplement of Reading  the "exposure of error,"6 there follows a view of the preface as enacting  a hermeneutic program based on a reversal of perspective . Its stylistic  incongruity is part of this reversal . To read the preface as a postscript, as  we do knowing that it was added to the poem, is to move from a melo­ dramatically serious vision to a charming anecdote that suddenly turns  us upside down so as to make us wonder if we are not now seeing things  the right side up. Granted that a fairy does not belong in a parlor. But  are not Enitharmon and Ocalythron equally preposterous (and much  more harmful) concoctions? Treading a fine line between the absurd  and the miraculous, the fairy asks us to see the narrative as a night­ marish fiction. For a moment he seems to be parodying Europe only to  appear as absurd himself, but then he puts us through a further reversal  of perspectives by juxtaposing pastoral and humor, Albion's fairies and  eighteenth-century domestic interiors , in such a way as to open inside  the ridiculous a window into the miraculous. As a hermeneutic signpost,  what this poem tells us is to turn Europe around and around till the  chinks in its cavern become windows into eternity . The cavernous form  of parody, which sometimes seems to consist only of the void created by  hollowing out the object of the parody, must be read in such a way .  Parody in the bitter form it takes in the narrative carries us to the vortex  of vision. To pass through this vortex is to revision the parodic process in  another more creative form.  What the preface generates, in other words, is a dialectically intricate  hermeneutics of reversal . The seeing of the vortex (as opposed to the  vortex itself) is Blake's image in Milton for a hermeneutic that grasps  'reality' as a transformational surface . As the mental traveler enters the  vortex, it contracts to a point of nonentity . As he emerges from it, he sees  it in reverse, expanding behind him :  The nature of infinity is this :  That every thing has its  Own Vortex;  and when once a traveller thro Eternity.  Has passed that Vortex, he percieves it roll backward behind  His path, into a globe itself infolding; like a sun :  Or like a moon , or like a universe of starry majesty.  (E 1 09 ;  1 5 : 2 1 -25)   In  the passage immediately following this one, Milton, having entered  his shadow, the body of beliefs he can no longer inhabit, enters the inert  Albion,  and his vision contracts toward imaginative death . At the same  time, the Eternals, from the other end of the narrative vortex, see Mil­ ton's "immortal Self" sleeping "on a couch I Of gold" (E 1 09 ;  1 5 : 1 1 - 1 3) .   6Leslie Tannenbaum,  Biblical Tradition in Blake's Prophecies: The Great Code of Art (Prince­ ton, N .J . :  Princeton University Press, 1 982 ) ,  pp. 1 8 1 -82 .   </page> <page sequence="9"> ( Infinite) Absolute Negativity 2 6 1   A s  a figure o f  reading, the vortex provides a means of containing the  proliferating reversals of parody. As we travel through Europe, the par­ ody first generates a contracting vortex, inverting the "Nativity Ode" so  as to empty Milton's corpus of life .  It mocks Milton into nonentity but  also restricts imaginative space so that we think of nothing except the  horrors of eighteen hundred years of history. As parody takes a more  open form in the preface, the fairy's song allows us to emerge from the  vortex. The narrative of Europe is still the vortex we are about to enter.  But we also know that when we return to the text's beginning, we can see  the vortex roll backward behind us and can see the parody of Milton not  as an inwardly spiraling despair but as "a globe itself infolding" : a new  world, though still limited and involuted .  It is clear that the preface expands the ways we can perceive the  narrative by effecting a somersault from parody to vision. But we also  cannot ignore the ambiguities of its style and placement. For its modular  status and incongruous style suspend its ability to function as the major  premise in a (re)visionary argument. Recalling the introduction to Inno­ cence, where the piper is inspired by a child on a cloud, this poem almost  seems to parody an equation of it with the earlier one by inspiring a  narrative radically discontinuous with its fairy-tale world . The fairy is  oddly indifferent to the content of what he dictates, as he sits in a parlor  sheltered from the international warfare described in the poem. Instead,  he laughs aloud to see the flowers "whimper because they were pluck'd"  (E6o; iii : 1 9-2 1 ) .  The parlor itself is a somewhat odd place for the fairy  to be. The paradoxical urban fairy is of course a parody of precisely the  response sketched here . But on another level the disjunction between  the preface and the narrative reminds us of a later poem : Keats's Lamia,  where the charming story of Hermes and the nymph tells us how it is in  eternity, but evaporates into anachronism as we confront the tangled  world of Lycius and Lamia.  Moreover, the preface is simply not present in most copies, as if this  way of seeing is not feasible most of the time. Placed before the title page  and the picture of the Ancient of Days in one copy, it is placed after  these plates and before the lament of the shadowy female in the other  copy. What this means is unclear, except that we should not too easily  settle into one view of the perspectival relationship between the preface  and other segments . Perhaps by placing the segment inside the Urizenic  frame, the text suggests that it is fantasy to emancipate the fairy from the  laws of space and time. Or perhaps it suggests that inside this Urizenic  world there is a window that looks outside it. Placing the segment outside  the Urizenic frame has no positive meaning either, except as a decision  not to place it inside, which itself can be viewed from more than one  perspective . Depending on how we see the inner placement of the pref- </page> <page sequence="10"> 262  The Supplement of Reading  ace, its placement outside may exempt it from the Urizenic world or may  simply make it irrelevant to that world .  The (First) Book of Urizen  Lacking anything like the fairy's preface, The (First) Book of Urizen  stimulates no visionary somersaults , so that the counterreading of things  as they are occurs only negatively, as in the case of Europe's preludium.   But if the text thereby exemplifies the tendency of a negative hermeneu­ tics to collapse in on itself, it is also an instance of how negativity can have  consequences that exceed the deconstructive. That the negativity of this  poem is productive is due in large part to its intertextuality , Urizen  himself being an intertextual figure whose refiguration elsewhere en­ courages us to re-vision this poem's deconstruction of itself. Urizen is  Blake's most ambitious epic so far: an attempt to trace not simply the  origins of European culture but of the (mis)creation itself. A first read­ ing is depressingly bleak, unsettling any claim that the text forwards  Blake's system by diagnosing the errors that have created the world of  experience. The narrative begins after Urizen's 'separation' and depicts  Eternity in a flashback that receives only four lines, as if the cosmos was  never sufficient to have stood or free to fall . The Urizenic world­ whether it arises as an act of usurpation or as a natural mutation­ generates attempts at containing its disorganization which only replicate  what they resist. The Eternals react to the chaos of experience by build­ ing a tent around the world (E78 ;  1 9 : 2 -9) .  Los is more constructive,  following the model of Christ and entering experience to save Urizen.   But as he works at his  forge binding Urizen, he,  too, takes on the latter's  functions, in Blake's first recognition that the imagination may be its  own specter. Los then divides himself and fathers Ore, whom he nails to  a rock in a curious disintegration of the Christian myth, which has 'Los'  occupying the functions of both Christ and his destroyers . Because the  plot of Urizen echoes but displaces the Christian story, the text seems to  hollow out the positive model that it seeks to reinstall across its distor­ tion.  Augmenting our sense of a text that deconstructs itself is the collapse  of the oppositions that might make it the history of Urizen's 'error. '   There is the erosion of the boundary between then and now which  allows us to conceive of a world without Urizen.  The Eternals claim that  death enters the world after the separation of Urizen (E74; 6 : 9- 1 0) .  But  according to Urizen, death exists in Eternity whose inhabitants already  feel "unquenchable burnings" (E7 1 ;  4 : 1 3 ) .  The four-line description of  Eternity is too vague and abstract for us to determine whether it is  </page> <page sequence="11"> (Infinite) Absolute Negativity 263  indeed a weightless freedom in which the senses can be expanded at will  (E7 1 ;  3 : 37-38) or, as Urizen claims, whether its fluidity is a chaos that  requires the imposition of boundaries for its form to emerge . Clearly ,  what precedes Urizen's separation is inchoate, and it is only with the  assertion of what Blake later called the 'selfhood' that the world we know  emerges : the world of "beast, bird , fish, serpent &amp; element" (E70; 3 : 1 6) .   Because the creation i s  coeval with the fall, the fall cannot be  a derelic­ tion as it is for Milton, though what is created is a depressingly involuted  form of life .  If the text blurs the line between Eternity and Experience ,  thus disintegrating the norms from which Urizen has deviated, it also  unsettles the opposition between Urizen and the unfallen Zoas on which  Blake's later system is based . As positive models , the Eternals become  constructs that the poem discards. As long as they simply are, they seem  emancipated from the order of time and space. But as soon as they start  to act, their affinity with Urizen emerges. They produce the seven dead­ ly sins that are also attributed to Urizen (E72 ; 4 :49, 5 : 1 -2 , and 4 : 30) .   They stand "wide apart" from the earth in a posture of dualistic avoid­ ance that mirrors Urizen's separation from the world of process (E73 ;  5 :4 1 ) .  Significantly , their response to Urizen's separation is described in  terms of a cloud rent by thunder: "Rent away with a terrible crash I  Eternity roll'd wide apart" (E73 ; 5 :4-5) .  The image suggests that the fall  is a violent, arbitrary event. But it also implies that the separation simply  potentiates the disorganization of Eternity by disclosing what lies behind  the mystifications in which we cloud it. This ambiguity about the  chronology of Eternity and Experience is present from the very begin­ ning: "Lo, a shadow of horror is risen I In Eternity ! "  (E70; 3 : 1 -2 ) .  The  phrase "is risen" suggests an event, a cataclysmic change. But this change  may not be from Eternity to the Urizenic world , for the shadow may be  "in" Eternity itself.  Our sense that the Urizenic world could have been avoided is further  unsettled by our uncertainty as to the chain of responsibility . From the  outset, an indeterminate syntax casts doubt on our assumption that  Urizen is the cause of what happens :  Of the primeval Priests assum'd power,  When Eternals spurn'd back his religion;  And gave him a place in the north,  Obscure , shadowy, void, solitary .  (E70; 2 : 1 -4)  Does he assume power in the sense of seizing it, or do we merely assume  him to have power? The lack of an apostrophe in the word "Priests" (not  "Priest's") leaves us uncertain whether the referent is singular or plural ,  </page> <page sequence="12"> 264 The Supplement of Reading  and thus whether Urizen is the primeval priest or whether the Eternals  are priests who assume the power to reject his religion,  insensitive to the  fact that "No man can think write or speak from his heart, but he must  intend truth" (E 1 ) .  We assume that it is Urizen who separates himself  from the Eternals, but then he is also described as "rent from Eternity"  (E74 ;  6 : 8) ,  as if by someone else , and he is characterized as "The obscure  separation" (E7 3 ;  5 :40) , as if he is simply an effect of an absent cause . In  failing to explain how the fall occurred , the poem limits our ability to  think of an origin that might have been different, leaving us simply with  the fact of things as they are.  A second reading of Urizen would not begin with the text described  here, but rather with its place in the secular scripture that Blake, by the  time he engraved this poem, was trying to assemble . Such a reading  would try to contain the deconstructive energies of Urizen and to find in  the poem traces of its own later re-visioning. Constantly recalling Mil­ tonic and biblical parallels so as to dispossess them of their positive  potential , the text at first seems profoundly resistant to canonical strat­ egies of recuperation. But in contrast to the bleakly naturalistic stories of  Wordsworth's early phase, Blake's poem uses parody and grotesqueness  to produce what Brecht calls an alienation-effect that prevents us from  passively submitting to the plot. Parody allows us not to identify with  Urizen, or not to see him as inevitable. We note how the cosmogonic  decomposition that occurs as the text moves from Urizen to Los and  Enitharmon to Ore is allegorized and thus dispossessed of psychic con­ creteness. Reason separates from the unified self, provoking imagina­ tion to bind it, but in such a way that imagination is divided by pity and  produces revolution, which in turn is bound by imagination. This deeply  troubling cultural deformation is then skeletalized,  abstracted from our  own experience, and mockingly represented through a succession of  cellular fissions and incestuous births.  Dissociating us (however tenuously) from its world of distortion, par­ ody frustrates the reader into constructing the absent norm against  which distortion can be measured . Though it risks self-consumption, its  instability can be appropriated by a hermeneutics of reversal that makes  the negativity of the text into the ground of coming-to-be . For Blake  would have found in Boehme and Paracelsus the ontology that gener­ ated Schelling's hermeneutic : an ontology in which opposites are mutu­ ally necessary and evil contains the root of good, thus generating the  processes that lead to its own reversal . 7 On one level parody remains  caught in what Paulson calls an anal or regressive form of revolution,  70n Blake's reading of Paracelsus and Boehme see Erdman, Prophet against Empire, pp.  1 2 ,  37.  </page> <page sequence="13"> (Infinite) Absolute Negativity 265  while prophecy is more clearly progressive, an internalization of pater­ nal authority . s  The revolt of parody is grotesque rather than sublime, a  self-revulsion. But, on the other hand, the parodying of Milton-and  (through Los) of Blake himself-could be said to cleanse and make  available certain functions that can be used positively : the creative func­ tion misappropriated by Urizen, the redemptive function misused by  Los, the function of exodus and liberation sketched in Fuzon. A tradi­ tionally hermeneutic reading would thus proceed by negating both the  world of Milton's God parodied in Urizen, and the flawed figure of Los  who is as far as Blake can get in conceiving a way out of the Urizenic  system. Blake himself describes the positive thrust behind his strategy of  negation in The Marriage, where he speaks of "printing in the infernal  method, by corrosives , which in Hell are salutary and medicinal , melting  apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid" (E39 ;  1 4) .  In an uncannily similar passage Kierkegaard focuses on the ped­ agogical reasons for using negativity :  there is a difference between writing on a blank sheet of paper and bringing  to light by the application of a caustic fluid a text which is hidden under  another text. Assuming then that a person is a victim of an illusion, . . . i f I  do not begin by deceiving him, I must begin with direct communication. But  direct communication presupposes that the receiver's ability to receive is  undisturbed. But here such is not the case ; . . . o ne must first of all use the  caustic fluid. But this caustic means is negativity . (PV, p.  40)  A hermeneutics of negativity accounts for the most troubling aspect of  the poem: the fact that the Eternals provide no viable alternative to  Urizen. A reading of the poem as straightforward satire would have to  construct a binary opposition between Urizen and the Eternals, in which  they represent a truth from which he deviates , and in which his perver­ sity is avoidable . As that opposition collapses, so, too, does the corrective  authority of satire . Satire, at least in the form of stable irony, assumes a  positive origin, but it is precisely that origin which Blake denies by mak­ ing the creation and the fall simultaneous. Because positive norms have  never existed, the poem can only negate. Allowing it to deconstruct both  Urizen and the Eternals, a hermeneutics of negativity lets the text exist  in a state of infinite absolute negativity without making its failure to  conceptualize positive norms a renunciation of their possibility. This  negativity, though potentially dialectical, is not like the positive dialectic  generated by the Songs, where the innocence of the children is a shadowy  type of something valuable . The Eternals have no positive value and are  8Ronald Paulson,  Representations of Revolution (1 789-1820) (New Haven, Conn. :  Yale  University Press, 1 983) ,  p. 8.  </page> <page sequence="14"> 266 The Supplement of Reading  not models we can emulate : they arise only as a repudiation of Urizen,  who also has no absolute value as something we can avoid , being shad­ owy and unseen. Potentiality can thus appear only as a gap within the  negative and not in any positive way. The gap is sometimes innaccessible  to language : it appears, for instance, in full-page designs depicting an­ guished figures who resist the world they have brought about. If  the plot  increasingly traps the characters in cycles of repetition, the "visions of  dark torment" unfolded in the designs unsettle the "words," the con­ sciously taken positions, that dictate each character's entrapment (E70;   2 :6-7) .  Significantly , the preludium speaks both of "words" dictated to  'Blake' and of "visions" unfolded before him, describing the two media  used in this text that is more dominated by full-page designs than any  other in the oeuvre . The metaphor of dictation suggests a meaning  already decided : one that is transmitted to Blake and petrified in the The  Book of Urizen, in whose codification the Eternals as sources of Blake's  inspiration are also accomplices. The concept of "visions" suggests some­ thing more immediate : a form of perception in which the signified does  not precede its transcription, and in which what is seen is simultaneous  with its seeing, as though things are still in process . Although the designs  may not be any less pessimistic than the text, they are different in the  mode of perception they generate in the reader. The text records what  has happened;  the designs involve us in what is still happening. Urizen,  who lies in a "stony sleep" in the text (E74;  6 : 7) ,  is falling, weeping,  struggling upward in the designs . Associating negativity with energy  rather than petrification, the designs allow us to think of it as Boehme  thinks of evil : as an intensifying anguish and darkness that ultimately  develop a countermomentum strong enough to overcome their destruc­ tiveness. The designs stop the text and confront us with something that  has not been said and can only be articulated in the cinematography of  trauma. The form of their negation differs from that of the text, thus  creating a gap within the text's negativity in which hope can produce  from its own wreck the thing it contemplates .  As he developed his system, Blake created a context for his Bible of  Hell that would enable readers to mobilize the negativity of texts like  Urizen. But there are features unique to this text that may render such  re-visioning problematic . For reading (whether hermeneutic or heuris­ tic) occurs through levels of identification between us and the characters  who represent us in the text, and through the speculative narratives that  these relations of identity and difference allow us to construct. But it is  not clear that the text contains 'characters' in the conventional sense.  From the beginning it challenges its own personification of Urizen. It  tells us that Urizen may simply be the name given to a mutation in the  order of things :  </page> <page sequence="15"> (Infinite) Absolute Negativity 267  . . . w hat Demon  Hath form'd this abominable void  This soul-shudd'ring vacuum?-Some said  "It  is Urizen."   Because 'Los' and 'Urizen' are not so much personalities as functions, we  increasingly notice the plot rather than its automated agents . It  is as if  the plot is a machine with its own logic : an empty logic in which actants  are automatically transferred from function to function so as to abort  the purpose of their previous function.  One of the more confusing aspects of the poem is the way it echoes  and disorganizes the Christian story. Los recalls Adam whose wife is also  wrenched out of his body; but he also plays the role of Christ as well as of  Christ's destroyers . Hurled into his own region in the north where he  divides and reproduces himself in a series of incestuous births ,  Urizen  �ecalls Milton's Satan with his progeny, sin and death . But he also recalls  God who creates the world in six days and rests on the seventh (E83 ;  2 5 : 39-40) . It is not surprising that Urizen should conflate the functions  of God and Satan in a poem meant to parody Milton. But then the  Eternals also recall Milton's God, who stands wide apart from the fallen  Adam, leaving Christ to save him. Dividing the characteristics of one  biblical character between several actants in the Urizen story and then  allowing one actant from the parodic version to transit several characters  in the biblical story, the text seems to generate a narrative that is pro­ foundly unreadable . Character names and plot functions do not stay  associated long enough for us to place a character or know whether we  should identify with him. This unsettling of the distinctions between  characters is repeated at almost every level of the text, from its syntax to  the organization of its parts . Thus Blake often uses dangling participles  or ambiguously situated adjectives that can be referred to more than one  character. An example is "Los wept . . . fo r in anguish, /Urizen was rent  from his side" (E73-74; 6 : 2-4) ,  where the word "anguish" applies to  both U rizen and Los. A larger version of this phenomenon is the trans­ position of full-page designs to go with different parts of the text. Thus  plate 2 7, a picture of a figure fleeing with his back to us, comes between  plates 23 and 24 in copies C and G, but at the very end in copy A.  Coming after the section on Urizen exploring his dens (or in the middle  of this section in B, D,  E, and F), the plate seems to refer to Urizen.  Coming at the end, it may also refer to Fuzon, whose exodus then  becomes a turning away, a negative gesture that associates him with  Urizen .  The reduction of personality to an effect of plot is further augmented  </page> <page sequence="16"> 268 The Supplement of Reading  by the displacement of characters in the narratological grammar of the  poem. Urizen falls into a catatonic state after his speech in chapter I I   and appears only in  genitive or  passive constructions, until he  briefly  reemerges as the grammatical subject in chapter VI I I ,  where he wanders  through his dens in a manner that reminds us less of a tyrant than of the  helpless voice of "London." Meanwhile Los, who plays the role of gram­ matical subject for five chapters ( I I I-VII ) ,  simply disappears from the  last two, as Urizen in the final chapter is once again transferred from the  nominative to the genitive case. Characters do not seem to control events  but to be produced, reproduced , and discarded by them. As the story  opens , it invents Urizen so as to produce its own beginning. Failing  thereby to recover an origin, it sets Urizen aside and invents Los as a way  of moving toward its end . But 'Los' only allows the story to repeat itself,  so he, too ,  is discarded, in favor of a Urizen who is again set aside  because he no longer functions as villain . Finally , the text produces  Fuzon, who is little more than a figure for an ending that might proceed  beyond the middle. Less a character than a figure for a resolution or at  least for change, Fuzon produces Blake's myth as a function of narrative  desire.  The process by which the text (de)constructs characters to explain and  complete itself renders cosmic history as a series of rifts and permuta­ tions profoundly resistant to humanistic reading. For the poem, rather  like Byron's Cain , interweaves two very different genres. At times it is a  cosmogonic narrative , an inquiry into origins that tries to understand  the moral structure of the universe by creating a cast of characters who  represent different aspects of the cultural mind. Profoundly hermeneu­ tic in its desires, it casts itself in the mode of scripture so as to suggest  that exegesis is possible . It  inaugurates the romantic concern with myth  as anthropology that culminates in Schelling's Philosophy of Mythology: a  text concerned with myth as part of an ongoing hermeneutics of culture  in which we create and interpret myths to understand and recreate  ourselves .  At other times the poem seems to be describing geological  processes that have little to do with scripture. It reminds us of those  deteriorationist accounts of the cosmos increasingly popular in romantic  natural history, in which the decline of the cosmos has no discernible  beginning or end. In contrast to Goethe's studies in biology, which led to  the organicist and teleological models of narrative implicit in post­ Kantian metaphysics, the model of time and thus of narrative that one  might extrapolate from geological research is of a permutational system  without a spiritual origin or telos, generating superfluous elements that  are not integrated into the system. Goethe's model of structure led to a  traditional hermeneutic able to grasp the inner form of a text . A model  in which narrative is itself an effect of the text, in which writing unsuc- </page> <page sequence="17"> ( Infinite) Absolute Negativity 269  cessfully generates characters and episodes to explain its surpluses ,  calls  into question the very notion of interpretation.  In other words, it is not just a question of deciding who is responsible  for Experience, and whether the poem uses corrective parody to make  us reorganize reality or existentially portrays a world from which there is  no exit. There is ample evidence that Blake played with these alterna­ tives and found them to be interimplicated. The many copies that omit  plate 4, in which Urizen explains his separation, support the first story  by removing any inside view of his motivations and thus making his  actions arbitrary. The copies that retain the plate create some sympathy  for him and leave us wondering whether we would have done otherwise.  On the other hand, the omission of plate 4 subverts the very story this  omission supports , for it also removes the arrogant declaration of the  law that explains the Eternals' rage. Proceeding directly from the disin­ tegration of eternity at the beginning of chapter II to the rage of the  Eternals halfway through chapter I I I ,  these copies make the Eternals'  reaction seem excessive. We wonder who it is that blows the trumpet that  ends Eternity . The text only tells us that "The sound of a trumpet the  heavens I Awoke" (E7 1 ;  3 : 50-5 1 ) .  Plate 4, which then has Urizen speak,  implies that he blows the trumpet as a prelude to the declaration of the  ten commandments which rends Eternity apart. But the copies that omit  plate 4 make it seem as if the Eternals, having just 'awoken' to the  existence of U rizen, whose world precedes the description of Eternity in  the order of the text and may thus coexist with it in the order of things,  trumpet their rage and thus produce the cataclysms that formally end  Eternity . In other words, these copies , by erasing the one segment in  which Urizen acts and speaks, efface him as an origin of culpability . As  in so many other texts where he changed the order of plates, Blake  allows us to create more than one version of the story . But it is not just a  question of deciding between these stories or even of combining them.  For what they share is a humanistic assumption that events are created  by people, and that interpretation tells and retells the story of those  people. And it is precisely this anthropomorphism that is challenged by  the text's grammatology .  To put it differently, the text borders on what de Man describes as  'unreadability . '  This is not to say that the literal activity of reading is  blocked, but that the poem seems to defeat any use of it as part of the  self-understanding of the reader. The questions about interpretation  raised by Urizen are thus more radical than anything we have encoun­ tered in Blake. For hitherto his emphasis on textuality has produced  writings that can be interpreted in more than one way and has recog­ nized how interpretation and culture intergenerate each other. Here,  however, it is the very possibility of interpretation, and thus the value of  </page> <page sequence="18"> 270 The Supplement of Reading  the text as a cultural resource, that is called into question. Reading the  whole through the part, we wonder whether this text does not suspend  the entire project of Blake's canon. By absorbing mythmaking into a  secular scripture, this project makes it part of cultural analysis and  therapy. But perhaps there is no Los or Urizen, and perhaps the inven­ tion of stories is only a self-complicating deferral of the fact that reality  cannot be constructed in anthropomorphic terms. Perhaps, on the other  hand, the poem's unreadability is itself a perspective . My discussion of  the text's displacements has deliberately ended in a thematics of genre to  suggest that even its aporias, unlike those of rhetorical poststructural­ ism, are about something. They mobilize relationships between this and  other texts , reinserting the text's very deconstruction of hermeneutics  into cultural dilemmas about the limits of understanding that are still  hermeneutic in form.  We can trace this intertextualization of the deconstructive to cultural  tensions that may still be relevant today, and that construct deconstruc­ tion or its approximations diacritically in a larger field of possibilities.  Scientific accounts of the cosmos that made human beings irrelevant  were beginning to challenge the androcentric narratives of scripture.  But the figures of scripture-figures like anthropomorphism, origin,  telos-still had a powerful appeal and continued to intersect the very  scientific accounts that challenged them. In Urizen itself the disfiguration  of the characters by the text must be set against the enormous promi­ nence given to the human figure-albeit grotesquely deformed-in the  designs . These pictures force us to participate in the anguish of Experi­ ence and create a pressure to see beyond it. The radical disfiguration of  hermeneutics that results from the language of Urizen may be simply one  perspective that the poem asks us to consider. It is also clear that Urizen  itself may be only one perspective in the intertextual dialogue of Blake's  canon.  Coda: Jerusalem and the Hermeneutics of Becoming  The fact that Blake continued to engrave poems like Urizen and Europe  alongside the final prophecies is evidence of his ongoing struggle with  the specter of his earlier texts . Moreover, it allows us to read the final  prophecies intertextually instead of according them the canonical priv­ ilege of what comes later. But it is also necessary to experiment with  reading them autonomously, and as such Milton and Jerusalem mark  Blake's abandonment of the heuristic text in favor of the 'work,' admit­ tedly conceived as ongoing labor, yet tending nevertheless to reify pro­ cess as a product in itself.Jerusalem consolidates the later Blake's commit- </page> <page sequence="19"> ( Infinite) Absolute Negativity 2 7 1   ment to a traditional hermeneutic , and in its discursive passages it  provides exegetical principles for normalizing the earlier texts . Milton  enacts a typological recuperation of the past that provides a paradigm  for bringing Blake's Old Testament into the canon. Admittedly, these  are not works of the kind Barthes designates as 'readerly .' Despite their  assertiveness ,  they are not repositories of dogmas that we are supposed  to consume passively. Instead, what they transmit to us is a semiotics of  renovation : an activity that is more important than what Blake produces  thereby. But the activity that the later prophecies model is radically  different from the perceptual transactions stimulated by the early  poems. It is, after all, the creation and not the interrogation of a system.  That Jerusalem functions primarily on a hermeneutic level rather than  in terms of mimesis or reference, and that it can be read reflexively only  if it is treated oppositionally, is what makes it a 'work' in the sense  suggested above. Blake indicates the hermeneutic nature of his text in  the preface and in the opening plates of chapter I, where he apologizes  to the public for the "Enthusiasm of the following Poem" and hopes the  "Reader will be with me, wholly One in Jesus our Lord . . . T he Spirit of  Jesu s is continual forgiveness of Sin : he who waits to be righteous before  he enters into the Saviours kingdom, the Divine Body; will never enter  there" (E 145 ;  3 ) .  Excusing the written text as imperfect, Blake asks us to  treat it with charity and to recognize its status (in Coleridge's terms) as  inspired if not revealed. The uncharitable division of the audience into  "sheep" and "goats" that heads the plate is self-mocking only to the  extent of conceding that there are imperfect readers as well as authors ,  and that they, too, deserve to be treated with patience. In the first few  plates Blake pictures himself sitting at his desk, writing of the building of  Golgonooza, which is not yet Jerusalem but its textual simulacrum, and  struggling with the specter of his empiricism,  which demands that vision  be proved "by demonstration" and "not by faith" (E 147 ;  1 :4 : 28 ) .  Gradu­ ally 'Blake' is replaced by 'Los, '  whose struggle with his specter is dearly  repressive, but whose tyranny is put to us as necessary for imaginative  freedom. It is the specter who works at the forge creating the poem,  because it is the dark energies of "doubt &amp; despair" (E 1 53 ;  I :  1 0 : 33)  that  must generate vision as a psychological supplement. That Blake repre­ sents despair as vital is suggested by the poem's opening image : "There  is a Void, outside of Existence, which if entered into I Englobes itself &amp;  becomes a Womb" (E 1 44 ; I :  1 -2 ) .  Unless we enter into the void, nothing  will be created. Once entered, the void becomes a contracted embryo  with the potential to be a cosmos. Whether anything will be born from it  is not dear from this image, which takes us only as far as the anguish of  englobing and consolidating vision in the pain of conception.  By situating prophecy in the scene of its own writing, Blake introduces  </page> <page sequence="20"> 27 2  The Supplement of  Reading  into the poem an awareness of textuality that is counteracted by the  invitation to the reader to make the "types" that Blake prints out into  truths through applicative reading. Vincent De Luca has persuasively  described Jerusalem in terms of a textual sublime in which the reader is  initially blocked by the visual appearance of the poem as a "wall of  words," but then experiences a "countermovement of exaltation" in  which he grasps the transcendental (in a Kantian rather than a Platonic  sense) . Relocating terms like 'gap' and 'abyss' in the vocabulary of the  sublime, de Luca absorbs them into a hermeneutics of the sublime as  opposed to a deconstruction of sublimation. Signs are passages to mental  'realities' that exist neither in the text nor in a realm of forms that it  copies, but in the response elicited by the text.9 That the poem uses  textuality in this way is undoubtedly true. But in addition, Jerusalem is  part of a specifically romantic genre defined by Friedrich Schlegel when  he speaks of a metawork that contains not only the text but also the story  of its genesis and a self-commentary. Thus the poem begins with an  account of why Blake must write it, which is then repeated more elabo­ rately as an account of why Los must tame his specter; and at various  points it produces metadiscursive summaries of what Blake thinks he is  saying through his paraphernalia of characters and events . The text  described by Schlegel is reflexive in ways that seem to verge on  postmodernism but that actually have more to do with a hermeneutics of  becoming. Situating itself in the author's life,  it conveys the incomplete­ ness of something that has not achieved the impersonality of classical art,  and it suggests the urgency of its existential project. By interpreting  itself, it conveys not self-mastery but a need for the supplement of read­ ing. These attempts to understand itself are again symptoms of a lack of  objectification, gestures toward a reader who will understand the text  better than the author, given that the author already understands it  better in the act of reflection than in the moment of conception.  Schlegel , we must add, did not see the imperfection and involution of  the romantic text as a flaw. Rather, he saw such texts as contextualizing  themselves in an ongoing process, and asking that that process be con­ tinued in the reader.  Crucial to the deferral of meaning to the reader is the use of allegory .  Allegory dissociates us from the characters and causes us to see them as  'representations . '  That Blake uses an allegorical cast of characters is  obviously puzzling, given his condemnation of the mode. One could  note with Robert Gleckner that he distinguishes between "sublime alle- 9V. A.  De Luca, "A Wall of Words:  The Sublime as Text," in Hilton and Vogler, eds . ,   Unnam'd Forms, pp. 2 1 8-4 1 .   </page> <page sequence="21"> (Infinite) Absolute Negativity 273   gory" and allegory addrresed to the corporeal powers . 1 0 Kant's theory of  the sublime involves an initial dissociation of mind from matter, fol­ lowed by an experience of (self)-identification in which the mind be­ comes lord and master. Transvaluing the physical into the metaphysical,  sublime allegory would thus avoid the disembodied reification of vision  in its physical covering, while using the dissociation of tenor and vehicle  characteristic of allegory to make us see beyond the merely literal . In  contrast to this metaphysical and visionary view of allegory, Steven  Knapp associates _sublimity and allegory in order to halt them at the  dissociative stage. Foregrounding as it does the personification of fig­ ures as realities, allegory is a self-consciously rhetorical mode that risks  reversibility : "Once the boundaries between literal and figurative agency  were erased, it seemed that nothing would prevent imagination from  metaphorizing literal agents as easily as it literalized metaphors . "  More­ over, allegory was connected in eighteenth-century usage with the sub­ lime, which involved a simultaneous "dissociation from images of ideal  power. "  To experience the sublime "was not quite , as some historians  have argued, to identify oneself with a transcendent ideal of pure subjec­ tive power, but rather to entertain that ideal as an abstract, fantastic,  unattainable possibility . " 1 1  Knapp does not offer this as a description of  Blake, who, along with Shelley, is a creator of myth rather than allegory.  But even though Blake's allegory is mythopoeic, it seems that he uses the  mode as a way of blocking identification with his characters and letting  us perceive the 'states' they 'represent' on a screen of possibilities rather  than in a world of identities . Los is, as it were, a mask for the reader to  assume : an identity that Blake has appropriated but in which he has not  yet come to feel at home, and whose otherness is marked by his allegori­ cal status. Our earlier discussion of Coleridge is of relevance here, for  Jerusalem, too, is a conversion narrative, and conversion offers us models  for which we are not quite ready-hence the violence with which we  must make ourselves imitate them.  The liminal structure of sublime allegory stops the poem from actually  bringing Jerusalem into being, halting it in Golgonooza. As a gigantic  construct whose body we cannot inhabit, as a voice without a face, a  character like Los represents a series of functions and not an embodi­ ment of Blake's redemptive vision. Through its disembodying use of  allegory, then, the text performs a certain kind of activity that is not  constatively related to any transcendental or visionary meaning that pre- 1 0Blake and Spenser (Baltimore : The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1 985) ,  p. 20.  1 1Personification and the Sublime: Milton to Coleridge (Cambridge, Mass . :  Harvard Univer­ sity Press, 1 985) ,  pp. 2-3.   </page> <page sequence="22"> 2 74 The Supplement of Reading  cedes it nor predictively related to anything else that will happen in the  'real' world . Jerusalem is not, however, a ghost sonata, for it is her­ meneutically grounded in 'Blake, '  who models for us the existential ne­ cessity of wearing the mask of Los .  As part of the process of miming the  work of renovation, the text also produces metastatements such as the  distinction of contraries from negations (E 1 5 2-53 ; 1 0 : 7- 1 2 . E 1 62 ;   1 7 : 33-36) .  These credal passages should be seen as generated from  within the text rather than as governing its interpretation.  In other  words,  they are not dogmas that cause the poem to come into being in an  illustrative capacity , but effects of the poem's need to organize itself as it  is written. Not always consistent with each other in what they say, they  are consistent at the level of their semiotic function. They tell us that  textuality and narrativity must be organized, and that this task is accom­ plished through the invention of certitudes , bounding outlines , tele­ ologies. The task is ongoing but also progressive, for Jerusalem consoli­ dates the labor of Milton, whereas Urizen may well undo that of The  Marriage. In this respect the later prophecies suggest a cultural praxis  quite different from that of the earlier poems. If accorded a teleological  privilege, the final poems represent themselves as advancing if not com­ pleting the stubborn structure . The early ones are constructed according  to principles that require us to recompose and decompose that structure .  </page> </plain_text>
