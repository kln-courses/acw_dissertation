<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOANNE E. BERNSTEIN Outstanding Children's Books' 1974 The following books were selected as outstanding fare for young children from among the many books published recently. It is felt that each will be a worthwhile addition to a class, school, or home library bookshelf. Age levels are designated with overlapping age ranges as follows: N -Nursery, up to age 5 K-Kinder garten, ages 4 through 6 P -Primary, ages 5 through 9 See What I Caught! by Ann Thomas Piecewicz. Illustrated by Perf Coxeter. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1974, $4.95. P The unusual instructions and information contained in this volume make it worthy of teachers' attention. Included are facts about the habits, needs, and living conditions of such creatures as salamanders, fireflies, crickets, tadpoles, and turtles. With consideration and safety in mind, the author instructs children and teachers in the art of building apparatus for catching the creatures and keeping them alive. The most successful method for cornering each one is carefully described. The book suffers from an abrupt style and a seemingly backward method of organization; but if information is desired, these obstacles can be overcome. 24 Young Children</page><page sequence="2">The Great Minu, by Beth P. Wilson. Illustrated by Jerry Pinkney. Chicago: F ollett Publishing Company, 1974, $4.95. P Here is a West African folktale to read aloud. It will keep children happily at the edges of their seats, as they have a secret the protagonist does not. The story could provoke discussion of life goals. The secret is the word minu, which means "I do not understand," but which is inter- preted by a foreign farmer to be the answer to his constant question, "Who owns this?" In the end, the farmer concludes that Mr. Minu's wealth led to his death and decides that it is not wise to pursue wealth as he mistakenly assumes the "great Minu" had. Primary grade children will enjoy the word play involved. Dinosaur Time, by Peggy Parish. Illustrated by Arnold Lobel. New York : Harper and Row, 1 974, $2.50. KP Peggy Parish's latest is an Early I Can Read book, and it is a very successful effort. The terse descriptions of the dinosaurs come right to the point, providing the salient information in a memorable manner. Phonetic instructions for pronunciation of the names is an added bonus. Many teachers may find, as I did, that they have been mispronouncing an occasional syllable or two. Arnold Lobel once said that one could identify a professional by two things: the quality of the person's research and the Dr. Joanne E. Bernstein is an Assistant Professor of Early Childhood Education at Brooklyn College, City University of New York. She is also a certified librarian.

He con- tinues to show versatility in his assignments. This book will circulate and at half the price of most books for children today, it is a must-buy! About Dying: An Open Family Book for Parents and Children To- gether, by Sara Bonnett Stein. Photographs by Dick Frank. New York : Walker and Company, 1974, $4.50. NKP Unique concepts in bookmaking are always welcome, and this book should be well received. About Dying is a down-to-earth discussion of death and the ways loss makes us feel. The unique concept is that of a dual book. Next to the photos are two narratives. One is for the parent, the other is for the child. The adult narrative concerns the psychodynamics of loss and explanations of children's concepts of death. The child's narrative concerns one child's experiences. About Dying is one of a series of books. Each has been written in consultation with staff members of the Center for Preventive Psychiatry, a group which runs a therapeutic nursery school in White Plains, New York. The others in the series deal with hospitalization, handicaps, sex education, and new babies. Benjamin's 365 Birthdays, by Judi Barrett. Illustrated by Ron Barrett. New York : Atheneum, 1974, $6.50. NKP Wishes can come true. At least in books, they are more likely to come true. As children observe literary characters solving problems, perhaps a bit of the mastery and control of events will be catching, and they will look for solutions so that some of their real-life wishes might come true. Benjamin, a shaggy, anthropomorphic dog, shows enviable inventiveness in satisfying his farfetched desires. After his glorious birthday celebration, he is saddened that he can no longer delight in the act of opening up his gifts. In order to extend his birthday a few more days, he rewraps his presents and opens one each day. Still not tired, he wraps up other belongings and surprises himself. Soon everything in his house is wrapped up, and he has given himself 365 days of presents. His next birthday ar- rives, and for the occasion he has planned the biggest present of all. In the end, Benjamin feels satisfied that, at last, he has had his fill of gifts. We, too, feel satisfied, because of Judi Barrett's originality. Guess What Trees Do, by Barbara Rinkoff. Illustrated by Beatrice Darvin. New York: Lothrop, Lee and Shepard Company, 1974, $4.50. KP The blues and greens in the illustrations complement the narrative in this book, giving a feeling for the forest. Readers are informed about the benefits trees provide, and the material is a shade more interesting than 26 Young Children</page><page sequence="4">that offered in most other "tree" books. Rinkoff touches upon the obvious - we get fruit from trees, etc. But she also delves into the production and manufacture of chocolate, gum, houses, and paper, ending with a section on pollution. Bubblebath, by Fran Manushkin. Illustrated by Ronald Himler. New York: Harper and Row, 1974, $4.50. NK This book ought to come with a guarantee, for it is certain to evoke delighted expressions, giggles, and multiple requests for rereading. If you've ever shared a raucous bath with someone, or if you've ever longed to share a raucous bath with someone, you will know the excitement this book brings. With fewer than 100 words, Manushkin manages to depict several emotional facets of sibling relationships, as well as a romp in the tub. Himler deserves kudos, too, because his drawings intensify the happiness. You'll have a tough time refusing to read Bubblebath again, because it runs in a circle - the end is the beginning - and it is irresistible from beginning to end. Omoteji's Baby Brother, by Mary-Joan Gerson. Illustrated by Elzi Moon. New York: Henry Z. Walch, 1974, $5.95. KP Gerson is a new figure in the children's book field, and she is a person to watch. When she returned from the Peace Corps, she brought a duffle bag of Nigerian folktales, lore, and customs with her. Her first book, Why the Sky is Far Away (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1974), demonstrated rich style and an ability to give a message without hitting the reader on the head. The same qualities are in evidence here. Insights into Nigerian daily social life and language are couched in words which effectively convey emotion and an above-average plot, resulting in a superior "new baby in the house" book. The Seal and the Slick, by Don Freeman. New York: The Viking Press, 1974, $5.95. NK Don Freeman has been writing and illustrating for a long time. Over the years, he has produced more than 30 books, and some of his works remain very popular. Perhaps this is because Don Freeman has a variety of skills, and can call upon each for different purposes. He seems able to pose serious themes in different styles. He has treated the topic of pollution this time, and there is pleasing depth and beauty in the illustra- tions. The cartoonlike drawings and watercolors he has used elsewhere (e.g., Dandelion and Corduroy) are not in evidence. In this book, the watercolors lend drama and impact to the story of the children's role in saving seals during the Santa Barbara oil slick. ^ November 1974 27</page></plain_text>
