It is regretted that it is not possible to supply answers to all questions submitted. How Early can Mongolismn be Diagnosed ? Q.-I shall be grateful if you would let me know what is the earliest age at which a child can be diagnosed as suffering from mongolism, and whether the condition can be diagnosed radiologically before the child is born. A.-Mongolism can be diagnosed at birth, although it is by no means always possible to be sure of the diagnosis during the first days or even weeks of life. Except in the most typical instances, therefore, it is wise to suspend judg ment until it has been possible to assess all the signs most carefully. Mongolism is essentially a condition in which mental deficiency is associated with a number of other congenital abnormalities, which commonly occur together in mongolism but any of which may be found in the normal. It is thus easy to be mistaken if a normal child shows some of the features of mongolism, especially in the first days of life. The shape of the skull is very constantly abnormal in mongolism, and it is possible that the flattened occiput could be recognized radiologically before birth. On the other hand, this flattening of the occiput may be seen in the normal and be absent in the mongol. An observation that a child's skull in utero was an abnormal shape might legitimately arouse some suspicion of mongolism, but no more than that. Clothing for Children in Hot Climates Q.-In this relatively hot climate I advise mothers to dress their children in one layer of clothes only, preferably of " cellular" weave, so as to protect the child from the sun while at the same time allowing free circulation of air and evaporation of sweat. I condemn tight vests or layers of clothing of any form, especially during the rains, as this would lead to the formation of a moisture-soaked airlock between the garments and discourage the action of the skin. Is this advice sound? A.-The only clothing required by a resting child when the ambient temperature is above 840 F. (28.9? C.) and he is sheltered from the wind is that dictated by decency; for an active child the limit will be lower. At temperatures below this, or when there is a breeze blowing on the body, first the skin and then later the whole body cools; hence the importance of seeing children are properly covered at night. Garments in a cellular weave when worn on the outside or as the sole garment are not demonstrably cooler, in experiments, than are other types, provided the cloth is no thicker; in general the thermal insulation of any cloth, of whatever weave, is proportional to its thickness, and cellular material, because of the way it is woven, is often thicker than other cloth of the same weight. For cellular material to be really cool when worn as an outer garment or in contact, through, for example, unzippered vents in a wind-breaker, with the outside air, the cells must be large in diameter, as in the Norwegian brinje garments. The "moisture-soaked airlock " between two layers of clothing is only a reality when the outer layer is waterproof, or at least water-repellent; but if there is a lot of sweating and not much evaporation the fewer layers the better, and the advice your questioner gives to mothers is therefore good. He is also right to condemn tight vests; loose-fitting clothes are preferable, because there is then better pumping action between the clothes and the skin, giving more flow of air over the skin. Protection from the sun is certainly necessary; first, to avoid upsetting the heat balance-solar radiation on the body can impose a heat load equal to the metabolic heat load of walking; and, second, to avoid sun burn. Your questioner might be interested in the dictum reputed to have been pronounced by the late Sir Charles Martin: " The rational dress for the Tropics consists of a sunshade and a pair of sandals only." Chrome Ulceration Q.--What is the latest treatment for chrome ulceration on the skin and eyes ? A.-It is assumed that appropriate preventive measures have been applied in the process concerned, and that per sonal protective measures are observed. Chrome ulceration can be prevented by covering any skin abrasion immediately with a waterproof dressing so that dust, mist, or solutions of chrome compounds cannot come in contact with damaged skin. No specific treatment is known for the ulcers, which heal slowly. The lesions should be inspected daily and care taken to avoid secondary infection. The safest and most effective first-aid treatment following contamination of the eyes is adequate washing of the eyes with water. This should be started immediately and con tinued for at least twenty minutes.- Except for the relief of pain, if necessary, by the insertion of homatropine and cocaine drops, or cocaine lamellae, no further treatment should be given until expert ophthalmological advice has been obtained. Stewed Fruit and the Diet in Rheumatism Q.-A re stewed fruits, cooked with sugar, unsuitable for "rheumatic" subjects, and, if so, why ? A.-There is no evidence to suggest that stewed fruits cooked with or without sugar are unsuitable for " rheu matic" subjects. Dietary restrictions are generally not required in rheu matic disease, but obese patients may be encouraged to lose weight through a restricted calorie intake, since in this way damaged joints can be relieved of an unnecessary load. Racial Differences in Runners Q.-(J) A friend who is keenly interested in athletics tells me that he has heard it said that a narrow pelvis is an advantage to a sprinter. Is there any mechanical reason why this should be so ? I should also like to know whether anthropomorphic surveys have shown a tendency for the pelvis in the btack races to be narrower than in white races, which might account for the greater number of record-breaking sprinters found among the blacks. (2) 1 have also been told that exceptionally slow heart action is advantageous to the long-distance runner and that this is commoner among the inhabitants of cold climates, and hence the success of many Scandinavians in long-distance contests. A.-It is incorrect to say that any single skeletal factor is advantageous to sprinters. The pelvic shape and size may be significant, but so also is the angle between the neck and shaft of the femur, the obliquity and length of the femora, and many other morphological factors. In surveys of the relationship between bicristal measurements and mean annual temperature Roberts' has shown that there is a ten dency for the pelvis in black races to be narrower than in white races: Bicristal Figures (as Percentage of Stature) French, 16.9, 16.8; Norman, 16.4; West African, 15.1, 14.5, 15.2, 14.9; Central African, 14.5, 14.2, 15.6. It is interesting that the growth rate of first-generation European children living in tropical climates falls approxi mately midway between that of indigenous European and indigenous African children. This suggests that environ mental factors are in part responsible for observed " racial"' differences in functional and anatomical measures.</page><page sequence="2">1438 JUNE 11, 1955 ANY QUESTIONS ? MEDICAL JOURNAL (2) Inhabitants of cold climates do exhibit slower pulse rates -than those of hot climates,2 but the differences are only evident under basal conditions: Relationship Between Basal Pulse Rate and Mean Annual Temperature Cold Climates.-N. American Indians, 53 per minute; Mukden (Manchuria), 53 per minute; Miao (China, high altitude), 55 per minute; Peking, 61 per minute. Hot Climates.-Javanese, 67 per minute; Hong Kong, 64 per minute; Bengal, 67 per minute; Australia (aborigines), 65 per minute. An athlete is not a good long-distance runner simply because he has an exceptionally slow heart action. More often the converse is true, the slow heart rate being the result of prolonged athletic training. Athletic bradycardia is not confined to runners, but is frequently found in persons subjected to almost any form of strenuous physical con ditioning, and is particularly marked in marathon runners and weight-lifters.3 Quantitative differences in training, and age differences, also play a part in the retardation of pulse frequency. Long-distance and marathon runners are usually older men with greater athletic experience than sprinters and middle-distance runners.' It is unlikely that the success of Scandinavians in long distance contests can be explained by " racial" bradycardia, and it is doubtful whether the heart action of Scandinavian runners is any slower than that of well-trained runners of any race. A more likely explanation is that a bigger pro portion of Scandinavians train specifically for the long distance events, and have consequently evolved training techniques superior to those of their rivals in countries where long-distance running is less popular. The import ance to athletic achievement of improved training tech niques and psychological factors has recently been stressed in this Journal.5 6 and must not be overlooked when trying to assess the value of natural anatomical and physio REFERENCES I Roberts, D.

Inheritance of Marble Bone Disease Q.-The only child by the second marriage of a patient of mine has just died at 44 months from Albers-Schonberg's marble bone disease. There is a normal child by the first marriage. How shall I advise my patient on the possibility of future children by the present marriage being affected ? A.-The severe form of marble bone disease (usually causing death in childhood from anaemia or infection) is very probably due to a recessive gene. Milder forms, in many instances at least, are due to a dominant gene. Accordingly, if the parents are normal and the child was severely affected, as her death at 4- months suggests, the advice to give the mother is that the risk of any future child of this marriage being affected is I in 4. Possible Benefits of Removing Nicotine from Tobacco Q.-(J) In what form is nicotine present in tobacco? is it possible to remove the nicotine without altering the tobacco's flavour for smoking? (2) What are the medical benefits of so doing? A.--() Nicotine is present in fresh tobacco leaf together witk the minor alkaloids as soluble salts in the leaf sap, especially in the cell vacuoles. During curing and fermen tation most of the nicotine is lost, passing into a mixture of pyridine compounds largely unidentified. Tobacco leaf from which nicotine has been removed can still be smoked with satisfaction by some people but not by others. The heavier smokers miss the nicotine. (2) The factor in tobacco which is responsible for some cases of lung cancer and coronary thrombosis has not yet been established. It is unlikely that nicotine has anything to do with the production of the first of these diseases, but it may well be a responsible factor in the second. If this is so, one could hope for an improved prognosis in some cases of angina pectoris and coronary thrombosis if it were possible to provide cigarettes which contained no nicotine. Removal of nicotine would, of course, eliminate the rare danger of amblyopia. Hazards of Thorium X Q.-Is there any risk in the frequent and long-continued use of thorium X varnish or ointment ? A.-Preparations of thorium X produce very superficial reactions in the skin, when applied to its surface, by the action of the alpha particles. Theoretically these are almost entirely obstructed by the thinnest of tissue paper and one would not expect any permanent damage to the epidermis. or especially the dermis. However, traces of beta and gamma rays have been observed in the dermis and it is evident that some of the radioactive material penetrates via the sweat and sebaceous glands. Sufficient time has elapsed since the introduction of this method of treatment to justify the dogmatic statement that the risk to a patient is negli gible if not more than 20 applications of thorium X in a strength not exceeding 2,000 electrostatic units per ml. or gramme are applied at monthly intervals. In some clinics many more treatments have been given when the patient accepts the risk, and so far evidence of permanent damage to the skin is rarely found. As a guide in practice one might state that unless encouraging progress has been obtained at the end of 20 paintings at monthly intervals there is little further to be expected from this treatment.</page></plain_text>
