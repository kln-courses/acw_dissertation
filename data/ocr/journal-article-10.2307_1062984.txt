[ANAXIMANDER, Diels, fragment B 1] THE PROBLEM OF SACRIFICE Years ago, Levi-Strauss performed on Totemism what would nowadays be called an exercise in deconstruction. There were excellent reasons for demolishing that hybrid, indeed slightly monstruous, anthropologi- cal construct and Le Totemisme aujourd'hui certainly gave it a mortal blow. Yet over the years we have come to realize that the structuralist resolution of the totemic hybrid into the rarefied purity of the Saus- surean langue involved as many losses in interpretive productivity as gains in intellectual comfort. In brilliantly conjuring away all that was conceptually ill formed in the house of totemism, Levi-Strauss's magi- cal wand sanitized its premises but also made them disappointingly My field research in Huaulu and other areas of central Seram in 1971-73, 1985, 1986, and 1988 was sponsored by L.I.P.I.

The reduction of the relationship between totem and group merely to the relationship between two differences-a difference in the series of the natural species and a difference in the series of social groups- consigns to nonexistence or irrelevance the phenomena of cult that may link a totem to its corresponding social units, turns its taboos purely into differentiating devices, and obscures the processes of objectification and fetishization through which animals, vegetables, or minerals be- come totems in the first place.1 This impoverishment should stand as a warning to those who feel too easily tempted to follow Levi-Strauss's example and do to "sacrifice" what he did to "totemism." Indeed we have seen of late some Franco- Belgian inexistentialists and a few Anglo-American deconstructionists break a couple of lances, and even a bone or two, in totemistically inspired jousts with this venerable-and venerably questionable-con- cept. Marcel Detienne, for one, proclaims from the heights of an "aujourd'hui" echoing that of Le totemisme aujourd'hui that the death of "sacrifice" will not be long in coming after that of "totemism": "Au- jourd'hui, today ... it seems important to say that the notion of sacrifice is indeed a category of the thought of yesterday, conceived of as arbi- trarily as totemism-decried earlier by Levi-Strauss-both because it gathers into one artificial type elements taken from here and there in the symbolic fabric of societies and because it reveals the surprising power of annexation that Christianity still subtly exercises on the thought of those historians and sociologists who were convinced they were invent- ing a new science."2 But is this claim of arbitrariness as justified for "sacrifice" as it is for "totemism"? Has the construct no theoretical jus- tification and is it only due to the secret dominion of Christianity over the minds of historians and sociologists? I agree with Detienne that too many of the classical treatments of sac- rifice suffer from the tendency "to minimize the alimentary customs, the 1 See M.

Thus in Durkheim's view sacrifice constitutes the moral subject-and with it society-by inculcating the habit of renunciation and abnegation. But taking refuge in particularistic analyses of sacrificial practices in concrete societies is not an adequate response to Durkheim's bulldozer universalism. For surely we need some general idea of what to put under the term "sacrifice" if we are to identify concrete rituals in different societies as "sacrificial." Detienne's preface to La cuisine du sacrifice en pays grec may well denounce "sac- rifice" as an arbitrary construct, an ethnocentric projection of Christian obsessions; nonetheless the essays that follow it do presuppose a general definition of "sacrifice," since they call a ritual "sacrificial" when it con- sists in the public killing and eating of domesticated animals. But not only is this definition not made explicit: it is not even properly moti- vated. For nowhere in the book can one find an answer to the obvious question that the definition raises: What is it that makes the "alimentary customs, the gestures of putting to death, the status of victims" among the Greeks or elsewhere worthy of being called "sacrificial"? What is specifically sacrificial about them that is not found, say, in one of our slaughterhouses or restaurants? How does sacrificial ritual differ from mere table manners or the prescriptions of the Anti-Cruelty Society? But leaving these contradictions aside, the issue raised by Detienne remains valid: Is sacrifice a useful notion or should it be "dissolved"? And if the latter, should it be just dissolved (as Detienne seems to argue) or be dissolved into something else, as Levi-Strauss dissolved totemism into a more general phenomenon? My short answer to these questions is that sacrifice, when properly defined, remains a useful no- tion, and thus it should not be dissolved or be dissolved into something more comfortably general but less informative. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that sacrifice identifies, in a very relative way, only certain mo- dalities of a number of relations (between humans and animals and more generally other forms of life, between humans and gods, between friends and enemies or rivals), whose other modalities are apprehended by other notions such as taboo, totemism, fetishism, animal symbolism, gift, and so on. Sacrifice cannot, therefore, be turned into a distinct thing, but must take its place in a family of notions, none of which has any validity except if it is relativized by the others. So what can a useful notion of sacrifice be? Faced with the bewildering variety of phenomena that go under the name "sacrifice," it is possible 3 Detienne, "Pratiques culinaires," p. 32. 103</page><page sequence="4">Hunting as Sacrifice to adopt one of two strategies: either to create a rigid definition of the essence of sacrifice (sacrifice is a gift to the gods, sacrifice is a com- munion, sacrifice is the mediation of sacred and profane through a vic- tim, sacrifice is the catharsis of violence, etc.), excluding all phenomena that do not fit it as nonsacrificial, or to treat sacrifice as a category of phe- nomena with family resemblances, that is, phenomena related to one an- other but not all sharing the same features.4 Both the "exclusive" and the "inclusive" strategies have advantages and shortcomings. The advantage of the exclusive strategy is that it makes sacrifice a discrete and clearly identifiable phenomenon, to be compared with equally discrete and iden- tifiable phenomena of another type. The exercise may be enlightening, as in Ruel's recent article,5 in which he is able to contrast systematically two kinds of Bantu ritual killings: those that have gods as addressees (and thus correspond to the usual definition of sacrifice as gift to the gods) and those that do not. But the fundamental disadvantage of the ex- clusive strategy is that it reduces what is always a complex and multi- faceted phenomenon to an "essence." The idea of "gift to the god," for instance, may indeed be important in many sacrifices, but even in those it fails to account for such fundamental facts as that the gift is usually a living being and that it ends up eaten by the giver. If sacrifice is a gift, it is a strange one, since it consists in taking back with one hand what has been given with the other. Obviously, there is much more than gift giving involved in it. The inclusive strategy is better, then, in that it takes in stride the complexity and even heterogeneity of sacrificial rituals. Its shortcoming is that no clear boundaries among categories can be established in a "family-resemblances" approach. All one can do is to decide that cer- tain phenomena are more "central" than others.6 The category "sac- rifice" will then resemble a galaxy: it will become progressively thinner when moving away from its solid center. Perhaps one should learn to live with the fact that thought is necessarily intergalactic. I suggest, then, that the central phenomena of sacrifice are elaborations of a basic art: the ritualized taking of some life (or the destruction/removal from the sphere of a purely human use of precious objects that stand as signs of life) to bring about some benefit. The relationship of cause and effect 4 This is an approach that has found increasing favor in recent years. See W. Burkert, "The Problem of Ritual Killing," in Violent Origins, ed. R. G. Hamerton-Kelly (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1987), p. 180; C. Grottanelli and N. F. Parise, eds., Sacrificio e societa' nel mondo antico (Bari: Laterza, 1988); L. de Heusch, Sacrifice in Af- rica: A Structuralist Approach (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985). 5 M.

The taking of life may be effective in itself, because it is ritualized or because it allows the transfer of forces con- tained in the victim; or it may be effective through the mediation of a power to which it is addressed (without necessarily implying the idea that the victim is a gift to him).7 The benefits that it brings about are very diverse, but all have a common denominator: the maintenance and furthering of the life of the sponsor of the rite and of his guests. One way in which sacrifice brings benefit and furthers life is no less impor- tant than others for being frequently unmarked. Except in rare cases (such as holocausts), most of the victim's body is not destroyed to re- move it from human consumption but is instead made available as food. Sacrifice is also, and often first and foremost, a way of eating what may not otherwise be eaten-particularly some forms of animal life. In sum, sacrifice justifies the taking of significant forms of life both for ulterior, symbolic purposes and for immediate, pragmatic ones such as eating.8 In either case, sacrifice is the authorized consumption for human purposes of what may not otherwise be consumed. Human con- sumption is authorized by inscribing it in its symbolic negation. The latter takes a variety of forms: dedication (or gift) of the victim to a god (which is really a claim that it is killed to satisfy the desire of the god, not that of the human killers),9 removal of parts of it (usually those that embody life: blood, the head, the long bones, and the fat), or of some victims if there are many, from human consumption, displacement of the responsibility onto an enemy,10 and so on. This is the renunciatory 7 These two alternatives are not so clear-cut as it may be supposed. This is one rea- son for rejecting the strong typological opposition between sacrifice and mere ritual kill- ing introduced by A. E. Jensen (Myth and Cult among Primitive Peoples, trans. M. Tax Choldin and W. Weissleder [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963], pp. 162-90) and developed by many others. The other reason is that, as processes, mere ritual killing and ritual killing for a "supernatural" power may not otherwise differ much. I do not see why an element, however important, should make more of a difference than a process. 8Of course, not all forms of life are sufficiently significant to demand a sacrificial (or more generally ritual) justification for their killing. It may even happen that a species has a purely pragmatic use in some contexts, and a purely sacrificial use in other con- texts. This occurs where the "disenchantment of the world" has progressed to such an extent that sacrifice has been turned into the gift of a purely utilitarian object to a deity, or that the symbolic value of the offering is believed to depend exclusively on the "magical" act of consecrating it (as happens in the transubstantiation theory of the Eu- charist, for instance). However, this radical separation of sacred and profane is rare. 9 More generally, the killing of animals for food may be conceived as a crime which was in due time forgiven and thus authorized by the gods. See the Greek myths of Clymene and Sopater (Porphyry, On Abstinence from Animal Food, trans. T. Taylor [London: Centaur, 1965], pp. 68, 83) and Genesis (as interpreted in J. Soler, "Semiotique de la nourriture dans la Bible," Annales: Economies, Societe's, Civilizations 28 [1973]: 943-55). 10 As in the ancient Indian horse sacrifice (J. Gonda, Les religions de l'lnde, 1: Vedisme et hindouisme ancien [Paris: Payot, 1979], p. 204). 105</page><page sequence="6">Hunting as Sacrifice element of sacrifice; but it is important to keep in mind that its ultimate purpose is enjoyment, not renunciation for renunciation's sake (or for its supposedly uplifting virtues, as in Durkheim).1l This definition of sacrifice should explain why, in its fully developed forms, the rite typically includes the following acts in the following or- der of occurrence: 1. Induction. This refers to the procuring (especially if it is a wild animal12 or an enemy) and preparing of the victim. The preparation fre- quently includes an element of persuasion (the victim is told that it is not really going to die,13 or its assent to its death is determined by various signs) and an invocation/dedication in which the purpose of sacrifice and eventually its addressees and/or witnesses (human and divine), may be specified. "Induction" is thus a much wider category than Hubert and Mauss's "consecration." It recognizes that certain apparently nonritual premises of the sacrifice (such as a raid on enemies and their cattle, a hunt, and so on) are in fact fully part of it and sometimes more important than formal consecration. 2. Taking of life. This is of course a conditio sine qua non of sacrifice, if it involves living victims,14 as is usually the case.15 I use "taking of life" rather than "killing" because the latter seems more appropriate to animal or human sacrifice, in which the element of vio- lence is much stronger and may take the theatrical and emotional aspects 1 As the Indian ritualists recognized, it is desire that drives sacrifice (M. Biardeau, "Le sacrifice dans l'hindouisme," in M. Biardeau and C. Malamoud, Le sacrifice dans l'Inde ancienne [Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1976], pp. 7-154; 0. Herrenschmidt, "A qui profite le crime? Cherchez le sacrifiant," L'Homme 18 [1978]: 7-18; V. Das, "Lan- guage of Sacrifice," Man, n.s., 18 [1983]: 445-62). But even a domesticated animal may have to be captured from the herd or the flock. Furthermore, it may have to be captured from a herd or flock that belongs to an enemy. My point is, these are not purely pragmatic acts preceding sacrifice, but are part of the ritual and of what gives it efficacy. Sacrifice is, after all, a triumph, an act of human con- trol that begins by controlling animals and humans. Even obtaining victims as presta- tions from social partners or rivals may be a sort of victory that contributes to the overall success of sacrifice. 13 Thus, in Vedic sacrifice, the victim is addressed with the words, "You do not die, nor do you come to harm, to the gods you go along paths good to go" (Taittiriya Brah- mana 3.7.7.14, cited in J. C. Heesterman, The Broken World of Sacrifice: An Essay in Ancient Indian Ritual [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993], p. 34). 14 Note that what may appear to us an inert object may be conceived as living by the performers of sacrifice or as a symbolic substitute of their life. 15 It is possible merely to dedicate a victim to the gods, or renounce it for ritual purposes, and then let it free without killing it. But renunciation without killing is not frequent. Fur- thermore, future victims may be selected from these dedicated animals or humans. Also, freeing these dedicated victims usually makes it possible to kill and eat other members of their species (as happened with the first fish caught among the Maori; see R. Taylor, Te Ika a Maui: or, New Zealand and Its Inhabitants, 2d ed. [London: Macintosch, 1870], p. 200). Thus it is artificial to separate the freeing of dedicated victims from what follows it and is made possible by it. Many acts of appropriation that do not appear as sacrificial are in fact rendered so by their logical connection with such antecedents. 106</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions that are often its correlate. In vegetal sacrifice, there is taking of life, but not killing, unless the plant has a special theomorphic, anthropomor- phic, or theriomorphic status.16 3. Renunciation. This term designates the cutting off from human consumption of part (and sometimes of the whole) of the victim. The renounced part may be just abandoned, or buried, or immersed, or even thrown away. But it may also be made unusable by combustion-a common procedure.17 The latter may be also associated with the idea that the smoke brings a share of the victim, or the entire victim, to a god who is the addressee of the sacrifice. In this case, the sacrifice may also be conceived as a gift to him. But the idea of the gift is less widespread and less fundamental than the ideas of renunciation or prescribed im- molation.18 Indeed it is illegitimate to infer a giving to from a giving up.19 The gift presupposes a renunciation, but the renunciation does not necessarily imply a gift. And even when the idea of gift is present, the identity of the recipient may be a matter of indifference.20 The "other" that is supposed to appropriate the renounced share of the sacrifice is often unfocused.21 What is focused is that something has to be given up or destroyed so that something may be obtained. 16 Thus the Indian sages say that the some plant-which is conceived as a god-is "killed" when it is sacrificed (Heesterman, The Broken World, p. 9). See also the sac- rifice of the kava (a plant that originated from the body of a human) in western Polynesia (E. R. Leach, "The Structure of Symbolism," in The Interpretation of Ritual, ed. J. La Fontaine [London: Tavistock, 1972]; V. Valeri, "Death in Heaven: Myths and Rites of Kinship in Tongan Kingship," History and Anthropology 4 (1989): 209-47). 17 As for instance the cremation of the long bones and the fat of the victims in the Olympian sacrifice of the Greeks (Hesiod Theogony 540-41; see J.-P. Vernant, "A la table des hommes: Mythe de fondation du sacrifice chez H6siode," in D6tienne and Ver- nant, eds., La cuisine du sacrifice). 18 The idea of sacrifice as gift is not very noticeable in some of the paradigmatic sac- rificial traditions. Far from seeing the essence of sacrifice in the gift, the Indian sages "make a clear-cut distinction" between them, as they belong to different ages of the world (Heesterman, The Broken World, p. 13; see Manu 1.85). At best one can say that "le don est une forme du sacrifice (loin que le sacrifice soite une forme du don)" (C. Malamoud, "Terminer le sacrifice: remarquer sur les honoraires rituels," in Biardeau and Malamoud, pp. 189-90. The gift-to-a-god element is absent in many Greek sacrifices, such as the "ox-slaying" festival of Magnesia, which was nonetheless called thusia (sacrifice) (R. K. Yerkes, Sacrifice in Greek and Roman Religions and in Early Judaism [New York: Scrib- ners, 1952], pp. 74-79). Among the Hebrews too, as Heesterman (The Broken World, p. 11) notes, there was at least one "sacrifice" (zebach) that was definitely not a gift, but just a prescribed immolation followed by consumption (the pesach lamb, see Exod. 12:1- 27; Deut. 16:2). 19 See Valeri, Kingship and Sacrifice (n. 1 above), p. 61. 20 Thus it was usually "quite irrelevant" to whom and how first fruit offerings went in ancient Greece (W. Burkert, Structure and Change in Greek Mythology and Ritual [Ber- keley: University of California Press, 1979], p. 52). 21 This is precisely why, although it is generically defined as divine, it may in fact take any form of otherness: the bird, the rat, the foreigner, the outcast that actually con- sume the offering. 107</page><page sequence="8">Hunting as Sacrifice 4. Consumption. Only after some part of the sacrifice has been given up, or given to the gods, can the human participants enjoy the rest-usually the largest share.22 This is the more social and festive part of sacrifice, in which all kinds of purely human components (shar- ing, dividing according to rank, creating debts or paying them, acquir- ing prestige, and also-why not?-filling one's belly)23 take over. Not infrequently, and in contrast to Hubert and Mauss's scheme, this is the climax of sacrifice. Three main kinds of relations are played out throughout the above stages. The first and often more overt one is the relationship between humans and gods. The sacrifice may be performed as an obligation to the gods or because it was instituted by them. In addition, it may be per- formed to please them or to obtain favors from them. But the gods may also be present as those who legitimize the taking of life and neutralize its dangers.24 In the latter case, it is the relationship between humans and their victims (usually animal and vegetal, but sometimes also hu- man) that is central to sacrifice. The gods are only an accessory to it- and they are not even a necessary one, as we have seen. Interestingly, this-the authorization of killing for human consumption-is the as- pect of sacrifice that seems most resilient,25 even when all the rest is 22 It may also be the whole, if the part reserved for the god is simply the invisible "essence." Then one can say that gods and humans consume different "wholes" that re- produce their distinct forms of being: the spiritual whole and the material whole. This view may or may not imply the blending of the consumption stage with the renunciation one, that is, the idea that gods and humans eat together. When there is blending, sacrifice becomes essentially a banquet with the god or gods, as is the case with the pesach sacrifice of the Hebrews and with Roman sacrifice (C. Santini, "Il lessico della spartizione nel sac- rificio romano," in Grottanelli and Parise, eds., p. 299; cf. P. Veyne, Bread and Circuses [Harmondsworth, England, Penguin, 1990], pp. 93-94, 168, n. 108). These banquet or even communion sacrifices are ways of confirming the alliance of gods and humans, but also-more subtly-ways of lowering the gods to one's level as much as raising oneself to theirs (see L. Feuerbach, "Das Geheimnis des Opfer, oder der Mensch ist, was er isst," in Kleinere Schriften (1851-1866) [Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1972], 4:26-52). 23 The desire for meat is a recognized element of Vedic sacrifice (Heesterman, The Broken World, p. 28). Sacrifice is represented as a meal of meat in Hesiod and else- where; further, the Greek verbs that indicate the killing of an animal for meat are identi- cal to those that refer to its immolation in sacrifice (Vernant, pp. 43, 44-45). 24 The paradigmatic case is here Vedic sacrifice: "Non seulement le sacrifice efface le caractere violent du meurtre rituel, mais il contribue a laver toute souillure caus6e par la violence" (Biardeau [n. 11 above], p. 126). In Manu's words, "Killing in a sacrifice is not killing" (Manavadharmasastra v, 39; trans. W. Doniger and B. Smith, The Laws of Manu [Harmondsworth, England: Penguin, 1991], p. 103). 25 It is also much more important and widespread than is usually recognized. Sacrifice is the only legitimate way of eating animals or even plants when these have, for whatever reason, a "sacred" status. This "sacredness" is minimally a sign of the reciprocity that ex- ists among humans and animals, particularly when the latter are very close to humans, as is almost universally the case with cattle among pastoralists and agriculturalists (the la- boring ox in ancient Greece is a case in point; see P. Vidal-Naquet, "Chasse et sacrifice dans l"Orestie' d'Eschyle," in J.-P. Vernant and P. Vidal-Naquet, Mythe et tragddie en Grece 108</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions gone. Of the Hebrew sacrifice, little is left but the prescription that all meat consumed should come from animals that are still killed according to the ancient sacrificial prescription, that is, with the attribution of blood-of life-to God. The old idea that a person who kills an animal nonsacrificially is guilty of bloodshed, indeed of murder, and should thus, by right, be "cut off," is thus still around, and not only in Jewish and Islamic practice.26 Indeed, as Vialles has suggested, its presence is still felt in the Christian world, which has evidently not completely lost touch with its most remote, Mosaic sources.27 Finally, interhuman relations play a fundamental role in sacrifice. The sequential structure of the ritual indicates this. It starts with an induction of the victims, which signifies competition or conflict with other humans: either because their different abilities in procuring vic- tims is demonstrated, or because the rivals are themselves turned into (human) victims, or because they are forced or persuaded to contribute victims. The ritual ends with a banquet, which should stress reconcili- ation and reaffirm existing hierarchies or validate new hierarchies as displayed by the sacrificial event, but may provide instead an opportu- nity for new conflicts and contests. In the extreme, sacrifices become struggles to death-in which the true victim may be the sacrificer. In fact, all fundamental relations involved in sacrifice are permeated by the spirit of contest: not only interhuman relations, but also relations between humans and gods and between animals and humans. There are ancienne [Paris: Maspero, 1977], p. 139; J.-L. Durand, Sacrifice et labour en Grece an- cienne [Paris: Editions de la d6couverte; Rome: Ecole francaise de Rome, 1986]), and with the largest game among hunters. In those cases, the taking of a life that is so closely intertwined with human life evokes the possibility of a reversal, of a revenge: the taking of the human life by powers that represent those animals. 26 "Any Israelite who slaughters an ox, a sheep, or a goat, either inside or outside the camp, and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of the Presence to present it as an offering to the LORD before the Tabernacle of the LORD shall be held guilty of blood- shed: that man has shed blood and shall be cut off from his people" (New English Bible, Lev. 17:3-5). This passage clearly shows that the killing of the three main domesticated animals is equated to murder unless the animal is sacrificed to God (see C. Grottanelli, "Aspetti del sacrificio nel mondo greco e nella Bibbia ebraica," in Grottanelli and Parise, eds., p. 130). One could not find a more perfect statement of the idea of sacrifice as au- thorization of killing for human consumption. 27 N. Vialles, Le sang et la chair: Les abattoirs des pays de l'Adour (Paris: Editions de la maison des sciences de l'Homme, 1987). Leach has also noted that "a curious usage suggests that we are ashamed of killing any animal of substantial size. When dead, bul- lock becomes beef, pig becomes pork, sheep becomes mutton, calf becomes veal, and deer becomes venison" (E. R. Leach, "Anthropological Aspects of Language: Animal Categories and Verbal Abuse," in New Directions in the Study of Language, ed. E. H. Lenneberg [Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1964], p. 47). On these issues, see also S. dalla Bernardina, "Une personne pas tout a fait comme les autres: L'animal et son statut," L'Homme 31 (1991): 33-50; C. M6chin, "Les regles de la bonne mort animale en Europe occidentale," ['Homme 31 (1991): 51-67. 109</page><page sequence="10">Hunting as Sacrifice sacrifices that even include struggles between animals, as in Toraja (Sulawesi, Indonesia), where water buffalos are made to fight before they are slaughtered.28 It appears that when one of these relations is emphasized over the others, certain aspects of sacrifice will correspondingly be emphasized at the expense of others. Thus, if the relationship of humans with gods is emphasized at the expense of interhuman relations, the consumption stage may be reduced or may even disappear altogether. Correspond- ingly, renunciation, most likely in its gift form, becomes paramount. The victim may be entirely destroyed.29 But reciprocally, if interhuman relations are emphasized, the consumption aspect of sacrifice is likely to be expanded and the renunciation one reduced. Finally if the relation of human and victim is emphasized, it will probably be at the expense of the gift-to-the-gods component. Renunciation may then take a largely negative form: not eating certain parts may become a more important idea than giving them to a certain god. But it goes without saying that nothing is predetermined, and that different outcomes are possible. The nature of the victim may also imply the modification or even elimination of aspects of the sacrifice. For instance, if the victim is veg- etal instead of animal, the induction stage is unlikely to be very devel- oped or dramatic: a plant does not have to be captured or persuaded to die, although it may still be dedicated. But if the victim is human, the induction stage may be greatly developed, together with its rivalrous and antagonistic elements, inasmuch as the capture and "taming" of the enemy may be the ideal first step of the sacrifice.30 Finally, whenever the sacrifice consists in the offering of an inanimate object to the gods, the renunciation stage (usually in the specific form of a destruction) is the most developed. The induction stage may well be reduced in scope. The taking of life does not apply and the consumption stage is most likely absent. Other variations in emphasis and shape may be produced by the var- ious purposes of the sacrificial action, of course. These purposes and their effects are rather easily worked out from the three main relations underlying sacrifice.31 For instance, if the purpose of the rite is expia- 28 Personal observations, July 1990. 29 As Mauss pointed out, "la destruction sacrificielle a pr6cisement pour but d'etre une donation qui soit n6cessairement rendue" (M. Mauss, "Essai sur le don," in Sociologie et anthropologie [Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1968], p. 167). 30 In ancient Hawaii, the war to procure victims was part of the sacrificial process as much as their immolation (Valeri, Kingship and Sacrifice [n. 1 above]; V. Valeri, "The Transformation of a Transformation: A Structural Essay on an Aspect of Hawaiian History (1809-19)," in Clio in Oceania, ed. A. Biersack [Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Insti- tution Press, 1991], pp. 101-64). 31 On this topic, see Valeri, Kingship and Sacrifice, pp. 81-83. 110</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions tion, then it is quite evident that the relationship with the gods must be emphasized. Or if the main purpose of the rite is to legitimize the kill- ing and eating of animals that are forbidden for ordinary consumption, then it stands to reason that the idea of a do ut des transaction with the gods plays a secondary role at best. But in introducing the above scheme of sacrifice, my purpose was not to trace all its permutations. I only wanted to lay down the prem- ises for developing the real topic of this article: the relationship of hunting and sacrifice. HUNTING AND SACRIFICE The majority position is that there is a radical contrast between sacrifice and hunting, however ritualized the latter may be. Sacrifice, we are told, is a phenomenon typical of pastoral and agricultural peoples, since it is essentially an offering, and one can only offer what one owns, and thus, necessarily, domesticated animals (and plants). Hunting, in con- trast, is a predatory activity, which seems to imply that the animal is "stolen" instead of being produced.32 How could it be offered, then? Furthermore, as a gift to the gods sacrifice implies the expectation of a relatively long-term return and thus a notion of temporality which, it is asserted, can only be found among agriculturalists (used to expect harvests) and pastoralists (used to expect the results of their selective breeding of animals).33 But one may well ask if this strong scholarly contrast between hunting and sacrifice-as two forms of appropriation of animals-does not reflect the ideology of the agricultural and pasto- ral civilizations that have most strongly influenced our perceptions. Perhaps nowhere is the contrast more strongly drawn than in the Bible, which excludes wild animals and prescribes domesticated ones (cow, sheep, goat) as sacrifices to God. No less strong is the contrast between hunting and sacrifice in ancient Greece.34 Yet it was precisely the Olympian sacrifice of the Greeks which furnished Karl Meuli with the paradigmatic case for his famous thesis that a historical continuity exists between the sacrifice of domesticated animals and the ritual- ized killing of game.35 Also, it is not the case that the sacrifice of 32 Jensen (n. 7 above); V.

Raffan (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), pp. 37, 57. 111</page><page sequence="12">Hunting as Sacrifice hunted animals is absent among domesticators and agriculturalists. The Greeks, again, offer many examples.36 And so do the ancient Indian rit- ualists, however much they insist on the appropriateness of domestic animals for sacrifice.37 Furthermore, they tell us that hunting is legiti- mate (for kings) if the hunted animal is partially offered to the gods, and thus is treated as a sacrifice.38 And, on a more egalitarian mode, does not the Bible tell, at one point, that the Hebrew who does not re- side in Jerusalem, and cannot therefore present to the sanctuary as a sacrifice the cow or sheep or goat he wants to eat (as was the rule when many sanctuaries existed; see Lev. 17:3-4), is allowed to kill it follow- ing the same ritual that is minimally necessary for hunted game, that is, by spilling its blood as God's share? Does not this rule imply a bottom- line identity between the ritual slaughter of the hunt and the sacrificial slaughter?39 There is no doubting a contrast between the sacrificial killing of do- mesticated animals and the ritualized killing of game among hunters. But there is also no denying certain strong continuities, overlappings, and crisscrossings between the two phenomena. As the few examples just given suggest, wild animals may be offered in sacrifice side by side with domesticated ones, and hunting may involve rituals that are felt to be equivalent to the sacrificial ones in certain respects at least. The sim- ilarities that derive from the necessity of ritualizing-and thus regular- izing and justifying-killing seem more fundamental, at times, than the differences predicated on the nature, wild or domesticated, of the ani- mal killed. Moreover, are we so sure that the contrast between domes- ticated and wild animals is always as strong as some theorists assume? Do not many of the herds of pastoralists live in semiwild state? Do they not have to be captured or even "broken" to be offered in sacrifice? And 36 P. Stengel, Opfergebrduche der Griechen (Leipzig-Berlin: Teubner, 1910), pp. 197-202. 37 Thus, in the horse sacrifice, wild animals are to be sacrificed together with domes- ticated ones (Heesterman, The Broken World [n. 13 above], p. 30). On other Vedic re- ferences to the sacrifice of wild animals, or to the use of hunting imagery to describe sacrifice, see Heesterman, The Broken World, p. 234, n. 72. Also, the Mahabharata lists seven wild sacrificial animals (pasus): lion, tiger, boar, monkey, bear, elephant, and buffalo (W. Doniger O'Flaherty, Other Peoples' Myths: The Cave of Echoes [New York and London: Macmillan, 1988], p. 83). Other texts add the rhinoceros, which is sacrificed to the ancestors (F. Zimmermann, La jungle et le fumet des viandes [Paris: Gallimard/ Seuil, 1982], p. 202). More generally on the links of sacrifice and hunting in ancient In- dia, see Zimmermann, pp. 74-75, 201-3, 206. 38 Biardeau (n. 11 above), p. 134; Zimmermann, pp. 202-3. 39 Soler (n. 9 above), p. 948, referring to Deut. 12:15-16; but see especially Lev. 17:13-14. This is certainly the view that I have found in Seram among both Moslems (who follow the Mosaic tradition in this respect, see the Koran 2, 175) and their pagan observers. 112</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions is this preliminary act-so reminiscent of the hunt-not an important part of some sacrificial processes, as I have suggested? In fact, it seems to me that many of the assumptions that underlie the thesis that there is nothing in common between sacrifice and ritualized hunting (but hunting is always ritualized)40 are equally open to doubt. That sacrifice must be exclusively defined as a gift, for instance, or that no gift-to-the-gods element is present in the hunter's rites are question- able claims. To reduce sacrifice to the offering of property is to simplify it drastically, and to confuse the totality of a phenomenon with one of its distinctive features. Offering is not in any case incompatible with hunting. The reason is that hunters are not devoid of a sense of prop- erty-both because they claim ownership to game through the owner- ship of the land on which it lives, and because the hunter owns, by right of conquest, the animal he has killed. And are we so sure, conversely, that traditional pastoralists and settlers share our own bourgeois sense of property? Or is it not the case that their flocks and their crops, their land or their irrigation water, belong to the gods before they belong to them? So that their gifts to the gods could in fact be viewed less as gifts than as restitutions, as token acknowledgments of the gods' ownership. Such indeed were the sacrifices of firstlings among the Hebrews (Exod. 22:29-30, 23:16-17, 19) and other peoples. There is also an interesting intermediate case that should be men- tioned in this connection. It is the case of human sacrifice. Frequently, this sacrifice is-at least in the most prestigious form-the sacrifice of an enemy captured in war. What makes the sacrifice efficacious, in this case, is less the offering of the victim per se than the fact that the vic- tim has been successfully vanquished, and as such it signifies success. This gives the induction stage of human sacrifice a remarkable affinity with the hunt (an affinity that becomes extremely pronounced in head- hunting rituals, as we shall see). We should not be surprised, therefore, by the fact that the human victim is often strongly assimilated to a hunted wild animal. Here again the Greeks furnish us with excellent il- lustrations, since among them the sacrifice of a hunted animal is often the substitute for a human sacrifice (as in the case of Iphigenia).41 What makes the case of human sacrifice so interesting is that it shows 40 Even, of course, in .modern Europe (see J. Ortega y Gasset, "A 'Veinte aftos de caza mayor' del conde de Yebes," Obras Completas, vi (1941-6), 3d ed. (Madrid: Revista de Occidente, 1955); C.

In fact, it shows that sacrifice can sometimes be modeled on hunt- ing, because hunting provides an extremely powerful image of the .power that sacrifice attempts to achieve: the power to neutralize and subjugate what counters or resists life-furthering projects. More important than anything else, though, is the fact that the differ- ence between sacrifice and hunting is exaggerated if the comparison is reduced to one trait on each side-if hunting is reduced to killing, and sacrifice to the giving of gifts (via killing or destroying). If we escape such reductive definitions and attempts to see sacrifice and hunting in all their facets, as global processes, then a better assessment of both differences and similarities between particular hunting rituals and par- ticular sacrificial rituals may be achieved. I propose, then, to take my processual and relational scheme of sacrifice as a starting point for a comparison with "hunting," understood here as the entire process by which wild animals are obtained and socially appropriated. It is time, however, to turn from the abstract to the concrete. I wish to do the comparison through one particular case, that of Huaulu hunting. HUNTING AS SACRIFICE Huaulu is the name of a small population that lives in the forested in- terior of central Seram.42 Undomesticated resources predominate by far in their diet. Food grown in gardens only plays a small role. Naturally propagating sago is the staple, but the most liked and prestigious food is meat, or ayokuam. The term properly refers to the flesh of terrestrial or arboreal animals that are hunted by men but is extended to fish and crustaceans that are procured, in part or entirely, by women. No meal is complete without "meat" in this extended sense. But it is taboo for the Huaulu to raise animals for food. Meat must always be wild and thus, one way or another, procured through predation. The three domesti- cated species (dogs, cats, and chickens) that live with the Huaulu are strictly taboo and so are, with very few exceptions, individual wild an- imals that are brought back to the village alive, and even those that 42 For details on Huaulu society, see V.

Animals are edible only if they have an autonomous life distinct from Huaulu social life. They can become meat only if they are defeated in a struggle with the hunter or fisher- man. The premise of this struggle is that it may always be resolved in the animal's favor. It is very much like war with humans (indeed war is fought with the same weapons of hunting), and thus humanizes animals in the Huaulu eyes. This humanization of animals (and, to some extent, animalization of humans) implies a measure of reciprocity between them, which in turn requires that the turning of animals into meat be le- gitimated by rigorous prescriptions and proscriptions. The Huaulu are predators, but not predators as in urban or rural fantasies: their relation- ship with their prey is based on a minimum (and often a maximum) of respect. The intimacy that the pastoralist experiences with the animals of his flocks and herds, the agriculturalist with his cereals or tuberous plants, and the warrior with his enemy, the hunter experiences with the game on which his life and sense of worth depend.44 The "element of personal duel,"45 which this intimacy always gives to predation,46 is particularly strong when the opponent is a large, pow- erful, and often dangerous animal. These qualities give the hunt an even greater affinity with war, and the game an even greater similarity to hu- mans, than is usually the case. There are three such animals in the forest of Seram: the wild pig (hahu), the rusa deer (maisarale), and the cas- sowary (asuali). The first two provide most of the meat consumed by the Huaulu. The cassowary, a solitary animal that is difficult to hunt, is of less economic significance-although its meat is much appreciated. Both the cassowary and the wild pig are dangerous animals. The cas- sowary has powerful legs that are capable of giving tremendous kicks. I was told of cassowaries that killed pythons. The boars are extremely aggressive, especially when wounded, and made dangerous by their tusks. Even in the warlike past, more men were killed by boars than by human enemies. As for the deers, they are not aggressive, but a male's antlers can occasionally be dangerous. I have myself seen stags goring each other in duels over females-another basis of comparison with 43 V. Valeri, "If We Feed Them, We Do Not Feed on Them: A Principle of Huaulu Taboo and Its Application," Ethnos 57 (1992): 149-67. 44 See G. Bataille, Theorie de la religion (Paris: Gallimard, 1983), p. 47. 45 R. Bulmer, "Why Is the Cassowary Not a Bird? A Problem of Zoological Taxon- omy among the Karam of the New Guinea Highlands," Man 2 (1967): 12. The element is no less strong when traps are used-contrary to what is postulated by Smith (n. 32 above). For traps are only a special development of the technique of am- bushing that is typical of the hunt with bow and arrow or spears; see R. Bulmer, "The Strategies of Hunting in New Guinea," Oceania 38 (1968): 312. 115</page><page sequence="16">Hunting as Sacrifice humans, in Huaulu eyes. But there are many more sources to the sense of affinity between these animals (among others) and humans. The cas- sowary, for instance, is the only purely terrestrial animal known to the Huaulu that is bipedal like man. It appears more like a man in plumes than a bird (although it is classified as manu-"bird"). The wild pig is highly intelligent, combative, and resourceful-all human qualities to the Huaulu. Furthermore, the sow is very caring of her piglets, which she ferociously defends against dogs and hunters. The pig is, in fact, the most anthropomorphized of all animals, even more so than the cas- sowary and the kuskus-although the latter looks more human.47 Anthropomorphization and economic significance explain that wild pig, deer, and cassowary form a very special group in Huaulu practices and beliefs. It is not just the killing, but the entire process of appropri- ation of these animals that is highly codified and dense with significa- tions. It is a process that, as I have anticipated, parallels the ideal-typical scheme of sacrifice because it represents one of its permutations. It rep- resents, more precisely, the "authorization of consumption" aspect of sacrifice. Sacrifices always involve a confrontation between humans and the sacred (gods, spirits, or less definite powers) but with two opposite purposes-as was recognized by Hubert and Mauss: they either "sa- cralize" or "desacralize."48 And their victims may be means or ends (or both means and ends) in these sacralizations or desacralizations. An animal may be sacralized or desacralized so that the sacrificer may be sacralized or desacralized through it, as in all sacrifices that involve the idea of substitution. Or the sacralizations and desacralizations may con- cern the animal alone and have consequences for what humans can do with it. All wild animals, and particularly pig, deer, and cassowary, are imbued with sacredness for the Huaulu. What this means is that they are intangible, forbidden, and that there are nonhuman, occult forces that represent that intangibility and actively enforce it. To appropriate the animals, then, humans must desacralize them, which means persuading these occult forces to let them go. Or perhaps it is more correct to say that every time a Huaulu kills an animal, he commits a sacrilegious act and thus becomes vulnerable to retaliation from the occult forces that protect his victim. These forces must therefore be neutralized and pro- pitiated through a variety of ritual means, some of which are sacrificial by any definition of the term "sacrifice." The main one is a metonymic 47 See R. Ellen, "The Marsupial in Nuaulu Ritual Behaviour," Man, n.s., 7 (1972): 223-38. 48 H. Hubert and M. Mauss, "Essai sur la nature et la fonction du sacrifice" (1899), in M. Mauss, Oeuvres, 1: Les fonctions sociales du sacre (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1968), pp. 256-66. I should say that in my view these two terms are acceptable only as short- hands for the ritual affirmation or negation of the "forbidden" or "restricted" character of an object, which in turn depends on the object's symbolic and moral status. 116</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions preservation of the sacredness (i.e., intangibility) of the animal through the "offering" of its prime part-the head-to the occult powers. The general name for the occult powers that receive the head is kai- tahuupuem, "the lords of the forest."49 Each tract of the forest is owned and ruled by one or more of them. They are responsible for its fertility, but especially for its availability to humans. They thus represent the continuity of animal (and, less markedly, vegetal) species in relation- ship to humans. It is not surprising, then, that the lords of the forest are composite images of animal and human, of prey and predator. They are supposed to become angry at a Huaulu hunter and his fellow villagers when he kills one of their animals (or also, as is said, i rahe ayokuam, "their meat"). They are especially angry and dangerous when the ani- mal is large or when too many animals have been killed. Their anger takes the form of ominous yellow lights at sunset, or of loud and fre- quent thundering. Also they attack the weakest members (children and women) of the Huaulu community in retaliation. In any case, a fearful reciprocity exists between them and humans. Just as humans hunt game with their dogs, so the lords of the forest invisibly hunt humans-and their dogs are pigs, deer, and cassowaries! The price of eating meat is becoming meat-an idea very reminiscent of the Brahmanical one ac- cording to which the relationship of eater and eaten in this world is re- versed in the other world, where animals in human form eat their human eaters.50 While in India the twice-daily sacrifice that is connected with the meal (agnihotra)51 avoids the fulfillment of this reciprocity and gives full mastery over the world to the performer,52 in Huaulu the sacrifice of the head of the animal simply reduces and postpones a reckoning that cannot be avoided. Ritual for the Huaulu, contrary to what is the case in Brahmanical theory,53 guarantees nothing: it is just one weapon in the 49 Kaitahu refers to land in general, but more specifically to wild land, which is al- ways covered with forest in Huaulu experience. While kaitahuupuem may be translated as "the lords of the land," I think that "the lords of the forest" is more appropriate in that "forest" evokes the environment in which game animals are found. The suffixes -am (sing.) and -em (pl.) function very much like definite articles. The suffixed form of a noun is the normal one in Huaulu usage. 50 See Malamoud (n. 18 above), pp. 205-6. The idea finds its expression in the cele- brated etymology of Sanskrit mdmsa, "meat," provided by Manu: it allegedly derives from mdm, "me," and sa, "he." Charles Lanman's translation captures this pun in En- glish: "He whose meat in this world do I eat will in the other world me eat" (Doniger and Smith, trans. [n. 24 above], p. 104). 51 See Heesterman, The Broken World (n. 13 above), p. 211. 52 "And, in truth, whoever, this knowing, offers the agnihotra, makes himself master of everything, conquers everything" (Satapatha Brahmana xi, 6,1,1 ff., translated from the French translation by Malamoud (Cuire le monde, p. 208). 53 See Heesterman, The Broken World; and J. C. Heesterman, The Inner Conflict of Tradition: Essays in Indian Ritual, Kingship, and Society (Chicago: University of Chi- cago Press, 1985). 117</page><page sequence="18">Hunting as Sacrifice struggle and reciprocity of all beings. Moreover, the lords of the forest's retaliation may take a form in which humans become the accomplices of their own destruction. This happens when the lords of the forest chase humans not as food, but as sexual objects. They then appear as panic figures that, assuming the illusory form of a lover or husband or even wife, assault or seduce humans, driving them to death through the madness of insatiable longing and desire. Eating thus becomes "eating" (a Huaulu metaphor for sexual intercourse). The arrow shot at the ani- mal bounces back at the human. But at the end of its loop, it takes a genital form: it penetrates humans at the point of their greatest vulner- ability-sex. I cannot go into details-however fascinating they would prove to be. As evidence for some of my claims, a statement of my friend Patakuru may suffice: Only the akaniam, "head" [in reality the head without the jaws], of wild pig and deer are put on the trees for the lord of the forest (si kaitahu upuam). Not that of the cassowary or of the kuskus. The jaws are hung in the kitchen for people to count them (ala i sehere, "so that they will count them"). The skulls of deer and wild pig are put on the trees for the lord of the forest so that he will grant game to us again (ala ia rulu ["make descend"] leku peni si ita). The deers, wild pigs, and cassowaries are the dogs of the lord of the forest (kaitahu upuam ia rahe wasuem hini maisarale pohi hahuem, asualiem). The game hunted by the lord of the forest are the humans (kaitahu upuam ia rahe peni hini manusia). His aspect is like that of humans (ita oi wahi manusia). He is like us. As big as us. Some are male others are female. The male lord of the forest screws women and screws men (ia polo hini hihina pohi hini manawa). Because he appears deceptively (ia hali ruwana) as man or as woman. He or she appears as our husband or as our wife, just like the lusi kinaem (literally: "the evil eagles/hawks": a category of evil "spirits"). If we [men] screw her (holo hini eme), or he screws us [women], we are as good as dead (ita maata' naunam). After you have/are screwed, you don't know it any more. You forget what happened, but then you die. Only the Sewaem (spirit familiars of the sha- mans) can discover what happened and cure us so that we do not die.54 But, as I have said, there are more sacrificial aspects to the Huaulu ap- propriation of animals than the offering alone. The offering is not just a religious icing put on the practical cake of hunting for meat and eating it. It is the culmination of a process that bears comparison as a whole with the ideal-typical sacrificial ritual. Let us compare stage by stage. Just as the first stage ("induction") of sacrifice has elements that are strongly reminiscent of the hunt (the victim must often be pursued and 54 V. Valeri, "Huaulu Field-Notes," (manuscript, September 12, 1985). There are many aspects of this text that require extended comments. Some will be briefly discussed below; for others there is no room in this essay. 118</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions captured, its resistance must be broken, and so on, even if it is a do- mesticated animal), so the first stage of the hunt echoes certain charac- teristic features of the sacrificial induction. Indeed the wild animal is not simply found out and pursued through practical means. Deceived by the hunter's magic or by the occult powers allied with him, the ani- mal is persuaded to surrender itself (for instance by running toward the hunter while he thinks that he runs away from him), so that it can be put to death. There are several types of occult powers that push the an- imal toward the hunter. One type is the dead (matamataem, topoyem), particularly the father and mother, and grandfather and grandmother. They continue to feed their children or grandchildren by taking the illusory shapes of animals that (like those that were called "les judas" in French slaughterhouses) lead their own kind toward the killers. An- other type (the main example of which is the mutuaulam class) consists of animals (obviously representatives of their species) that appear in dreams and propose a covenant: they will surrender some of their own to the dreamer, on a number of conditions. One condition is the premise of all Huaulu predatory activity: one should not take too much of any living thing. If the dreamer will hunt too many of the animals with which he has established a covenant, they will cease to become available altogether. Another condition is one or more food taboos. These usually concern the edible leaves of lokuem and laitiliem that are also eaten by the offspring of the contracting animals. In this way, humans express a concern for what stands closest to heart to the ani- mals (and to the Huaulu): the perpetuation of their species. In ex- change, that species makes itself available, albeit in limited quantities, to the Huaulu. A third kind of occult powers that give animals to the Huaulu as a result of a state of reciprocity with them is the already- mentioned lords of the forest, who represent not a particular animal species, but all animal (and vegetal) life that prospers on his land. As Patakuru mentions, the lords of the forest will not "descend" the two main game animals to the hunter if he does not give up their heads (and follow other prescriptions to which I shall return shortly). The contrast usually established between the relationship of the hunters with their game, and of the domesticators with their domesti- cated animals, is thus clearly overdrawn, at least as far as the Huaulu are concerned. Both relationships are governed by reciprocity-how- ever weighed in favor of humans. Just as the domesticated animals give themselves up selectively to their domesticators as a reciprocation for the food and protection they receive,55 so the game animals surrender 55 For eastern Indonesian instances of this idea, see H. G. Schulte-Nordholt, "The Sym- bolic Classification of the Atoni of Timor," in Fox, ed. (n. 42 above), p. 243; L. Onvlee, "The Significance of Livestock in Sumba," in Fox, ed., pp. 195-207; J. Hoskins, "Vio- lence, Sacrifice, and Divination: Giving and Taking Life in Eastern Indonesia," American 119</page><page sequence="20">Hunting as Sacrifice some of their kind as a reciprocation for a number of things that the Huaulu-like so many other hunters-have surrendered to them. In both cases, then, the appropriation of animals by humans can only take place as a moral act and in a moral context. It cannot be purely instru- mental and utilitarian. Animals are partners and agents in their own right. Their assent, or that of their representatives, must be sought be- fore making use of them, for ulterior ritual purposes as well as for merely alimentary ones. Alternatively, they may only be killed at the behest or command of powers that are above humans and animals alike: gods, ancestral shades, and so on. The Huaulu emphasizes the first option; other peoples-admittedly most of them domesticators- emphasize the latter but never forget the former. But these differences of emphasis should not be reified into a watertight contrast between "ritual killing" and "sacrifice," itself corresponding to a contrast be- tween hunters and domesticators. The similarities are much greater than the differences. Their source is an equal sentiment of intimacy, and thus also of reciprocity and mutual dependence, existing between animal and human. Only in the stockyards of Chicago has the animal become a mere thing, of which only the squeal is not used.56 But so has its killer. And in his case even the squeal is used. The next stage, in both sacrifice and hunt, is the killing. But it is less the killing than its consequences that are elaborated in the Huaulu hunt. One consequence is the intensification of the taboo on laughing at wild animals-a behavior considered disrespectful and thus one that angers the powers that protect them.57 One cannot even laugh in the presence of fresh meat (ayoku holuholuam), as the animal is still present in it. Only when its meat is processed (by being smoked or Ethnologist 20 (1993): 159-78; see also the chant in P.

The belief has a variety of motivations in Huaulu culture, only one of which I emphasize here: respect for animals. Another is that laughter is only appropriate with humans-and closely re- lated ones at that. The taboo thus emphasizes the otherness of wild animals and thus, in a sense, the right to kill them. A proof of this is that the animals that one can mock, namely, the domestic animals, cannot be eaten (and, in the case of the dog, killed) because they are quasi-human or, more exactly, quasi-Huaulu (see Valeri, "If We Feed Them" [n. 43 above]). 120</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions boiled) and thus fully transformed into food does the taboo cease. But the more severe consequences of the killing are experienced by the killer, that is, the man who "owns" (rahe) the animal because his ar- row or his trap58 has killed it. If the animal is one of the three largest, he cannot eat any of its meat.59 He must give it entirely to others. The only part of it (or rather, of pig and deer) that he can use is the lower jaw, which he suspends under the roof in his house so that "it is counted"-as Patakuru mentions. In other words, all that the hunter eats of his own kill is the glory of having killed it. Why this avoidance of eating? It is not connected with a sense of guilt,60 but with a fear of retribution, I think. It is the clearest indication that killing is a danger- ous, a "sacrilegous," act, simply because it invites retribution from the killed, or rather from the powers that stand for it. Hence the double ap- peasement of the lord of the forest: the collective renunciation of the head (minus the lower jaw)61 and the killer's renunciation of eating what he has killed. The killer and the eater must be split to avoid, as much as possible, the fulfillment of the fearful reciprocity between animals and humans. The rule thus instills a double sense of reciproc- ity: reciprocity between humans and animals, and reciprocity among humans-for a hunter cannot feed himself62 and is thus utterly depen- dent on other hunters. We have thus moved, almost by necessity, from the taking of life to consumption, passing through renunciation. For the human consump- tion of meat is not made possible by killing alone, but also by its met- onymic negation: something is not eaten so that the rest may be eaten, somebody does not eat so that the rest may eat. This negation or renun- ciation is more radical than the positive counterpart that it usually and almost inevitably takes: what is renounced, is given back or is even given to a power that reconstitutes the integrity that has been lost in the process by which life feeds on life, and thus becomes dependent on death. Also, most of what is renounced reemerges as gift to others, to 58 Usually a spring trap that releases a short bambu spear (supanam). 59 Smaller animals are dangerous to eat only if they are killed in large quantities. Then the danger must be reduced and diffused by giving away part of the catch. 60 As Burkert would have it. See Burkert, Homo Necans (n. 35 above) and "The Prob- lem" (n. 4 above). 61 As Patakuru's text mentions, the upper part of the cassowary's head is not offered. The reason is that the animal does not have much of a skull. What is offered of the cas- sowary (as of the other two animals) to the lord of the forest are blood clots found in the carcass when it is butchered. But none of the blood is preserved for eating. In fact, the meat is completely drained of it, as it is cut in small pieces. The Huaulu themselves as- sociated this draining with the Koranic idea that blood cannot be consumed because it belongs to God (in their case, the lords of the forest). 62 Not, at least, until he has killed such a large number of animals that he has acquired the right to undergo a special rite that purifies once and for all his mouth from the pollu- tion of eating his own meat. Very few men are able to reach this stage. 121</page><page sequence="22">Hunting as Sacrifice fellow human beings. Through the appropriation of animals as meat, humans are appropriated to society. The consumption stage thus takes the form of complex reciprocations that link hunter to hunter and hunt to hunt. This is not the place, how- ever, to go into details. Suffice it to say that every Huaulu hunter has a group of close partners and kinsmen (the two overlap but do not coin- cide) to whom he gives most of the meat he kills and from whom he receives most of the meat he eats. Beyond this circle, another exists- made of consanguineous relatives and affines (exclusively wife-takers) to whom he is obligated to give meat. Finally every household in the village should receive at least a skewer of meat.63 In addition, certain parts of the animal, or animals that have died in a certain way, should go to the wife-takers or, as the Huaulu say, to the mulua anaem, "the female children/children through females."64 A skewer of meat (called maraisiam) including three vital parts65 of the first animal killed by a young man should go to his owai (paternal aunt) or, failing her, to any other married out woman of his lineage, and be eaten by her and her children. She should reciprocate with a porcelain plate, which becomes her first contribution to his future bridewealth. It is said that this ex- change inaugurates the man's taboo on eating the meat of deer, wild pig, and cassowary that he himself kills. Subsequently, the maraisiam usually goes to women or younger people of the hunter's lineage who eat it with their friends. The maraisiam portion is given to these people, I speculate, because it embodies the vitality of the animal to the highest degree. It therefore makes sense that it is eaten by sisters, who must transfer the vitality of their lineage, and to their children, who represent the embodiment of that vitality. It also makes sense that it is given, more generally, to women and to young people to increase their fertility and vitality, re- spectively. But note that the vitality of the maraisiam is not the vitality of mere meat. This is indicated by the fact that the share is said to be makuwoli, "taboo/sacred." It thus has a sacramental value that, again, may be compared to the sacramental value of parts or the whole of the meat from a sacrificed animal. The meat of animals that have died a strange, usually too quick, death (a sign of spirit intervention) is also reserved for the female children and is extremely dangerous for any- 63 When I first went to Huaulu in the early seventies this rule was always followed, particularly with respect to animals that fell in traps near the village. In recent years, however, some people have become less generous, although they are roundly criticized for being "stingy" (i mohohuku). 64 That is, the married out sisters, their husbands, and their children and sometimes the children of the female among these children. 65 One looks like a valve of the heart, another is a piece of the spleen, the third I am unable to identify but it is taken from the genital area. 122</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions body else to eat. These customs show that, just like the meat of sac- rificed animals, the meat of hunted animals is not just meat. It has differential values, different degrees of sacredness, and different pow- ers, which signify different social relations and reproduce them in the various prestations through which that meat is appropriated. In sum, the evidence that I have presented suggests that similar schemes, in turn dependent on similar ideas, may underlie the appropri- ation of wild and domesticated animals in different societies. It is mis- leading, therefore, to radically separate the two. By associating them, moreover, we can bring out more clearly a dimension of sacrifice that has not received the attention it deserves, perhaps because its very im- portance makes it mute, at least to the religiously minded scholar of re- ligion. It is the aspect I have called "authorized consumption." Sacrifice should not be reduced to its substitution or sacralization dimensions, which admittedly are best served by domesticated animals. But even this dimension is by no means incompatible with the use of a hunted victim. This is what I wish to show, again through Huaulu evidence, in the next section. SACRIFICE AS HUNTING The offering of parts of the victim, wild or domesticated, may be used to make the rest of its meat available for human consumption. But it may also be used to obtain benefits that have nothing to do with eating. Of course, as the Huaulu rites that we have just considered show, these nonalimentary benefits are always in some measure implied even in the most alimentary-minded offering, since eating is not a purely material act but involves the maintenance of complex moral relations between society and cosmos. Still, there is no doubting that the main purpose of the offering is to authorize the eating of animals. But in other sacrifices the eating of the victim is excluded or its symbolic signification is em- phasized over its alimentary one. These are the sacrifices that are ad- dressed to powers that, contrary to the lords of the forest, have more to do with humans than with animals. These powers are characterized by a stable social relationship with Huaulu society as a whole or some of its parts or members. They could therefore be called "bound spirits" or, since they frequently visit the village or even reside in houses, "spirits of the inside." To call them "tame" by opposition to the "wild" spirits of the forest would be quite misleading, though. They are anything but tame, and they have to be placated by, among other things, offerings and prayers. Their main categories are: ailaem ("the ancients," "the old men," i.e., the progenitors), lumaupuem (the lords of the house), and sewaem (shamanic spirits). The category ailaem refers to ancestors proper but 123</page><page sequence="24">Hunting as Sacrifice also to any spirit that has been handed down-often through an object (utuam) that is the connecting point between spirit and owner-by the ancestors. It is therefore frequently used to encompass all spirits from the three categories. It is also used, of course, to refer to the ultimate ancestors: ita amare Lahatala ("our father Lahatala"), who is associ- ated with the sky, ikta inare Puhum ("our mother Puhum"), who is associated with the earth. The luma upuem are the spirit protectors of a house (here understood as an equivalent of an ipa, a descent group) but the term may also be used to include its ancestral shades and even its hereditary sewaem. The term also includes the spirit protectors of the village as a whole, who reside in a sacred house (luma makuwoliam), which embodies Huaulu society as a whole. Because of these more en- compassing references, I find it convenient to use "lords of the house" as the generic term for the bound spirits and "lords of the forest" as the generic term for the wild spirits.66 Just like the lords of the forest, the lords of the house receive offer- ings. But a number of important differences exist between these offer- ings. The offerings to the lords of the forest are meant to make the consumption of "their meat" possible. The offerings to the lords of the house serve to neutralize misfortune (sickness, sterility, lack of food, constant thundering, excessive rain) or to obtain success in hazardous enterprises (such as hunting and war). In both cases the basic idea is that the benefits follow from the neutralization of the power's anger. But the anger of the lords of the forest is due to the fact that humans kill their animals, while the anger of the lords of the house is due to transgressions that have to do with the interhuman relations over which they preside. Corresponding to these differences in purpose, and in the character of the powers addressed, there are differences in the nature and treat- ment of the offerings. The offering to the lord of the forest is more a symbolic restitution than a compensation. Indeed it consists in the re- nunciation of an unprocessed part of the animal (the head), which is symbolically the most important but is also largely inedible. The rejec- tion away from the human world is thus strongly marked and is further emphasized by the absence of any verbal accompaniment. No prayer or invocation is pronounced when the head of the animal is put on a tree for the lord of the forest. Nothing is requested in exchange for what is given. The offering is mute because it is self-explanatory and has no motives beyond that of sending the lord of the forest away so that hu- mans can enjoy their meat in peace. 66 It should be kept in mind, however, that these terms, and particularly kaitahuu- puam, are not usually employed by the Huaulu with as wide an extension as I give to them. 124</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions In contrast, offerings to the lords of the house are always accompa- nied by prayers, requests, curses, and even threats. One speaks to them for two reasons: because they are largely human and because one has to explain the signification of the offering, since the latter consists of objects that have no immediate connection with what they are sup- posed to bring about. We are here, then, in the realm of exchangeabil- ity and commutability that characterizes human relations. No wonder, then, that, to use Versnel's67 apt contrast-the dimension of the don- of giving valuable things in exchange for others, rather than that of the abandon, is emphasized, together with the more complex temporality it presupposes (the effects of the offering are not obtained immediately as is the case for the offering to the lord of the forest). This gift dimen- sion is accentuated by the fact that the offering is processed (smoked, cooked, or boiled), and thereby assimilated to the human givers: it can thus stand for them. Nevertheless, the contrast between the two kinds of sacrifice should not be overestimated. For the Huaulu do not use offerings that, being completely domesticated, belong completely to their social world. Or rather, their completely domesticated offerings are the least important, if the more frequent: certain socially significant vegetables and arti- facts.68 The most important offerings are blood offerings, none of which 67 See his comment on a paper in G. S. Kirk, "Some Methodological Pitfalls in the Study of Ancient Greek Sacrifice (in Particular)," in Le sacrifice dans l'Antiquite (Geneva: Fondation Hardt, 1980), p. 86. 68 The simplest and most frequent offering to ancestors consists of a tobacco leaf or a cigarette, which is stuck in between two thatches of the roof, after an invocation. Betel offerings are also extremely frequent and are part of practically all rituals. They illus- trate, in their simplicity, the most classical of sacrificial schemes. Through the betel, the offerer establishes a connection with a spirit, who imparts his power to it by consuming it invisibly. The transformed betel is then chewed by the offerer and other people who are present. The sacramental character of the betel is indicated by the fact that it must be completely swallowed. It is taboo to spit its juices out, like ordinary betel. The sacra- mental use of the plant is, however, an extension of its ordinary use-which is to signify closeness among those who share it (cf. J. Atkinson, The Art and Politics of Wana Sha- manship [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989], pp. 182-84, for similar ideas among the Wana of Sulawesi). The artificial valuables sometimes offered to ancestors and other spirits of the lord-of-the-house type consist of red cloth (asopem), armshells (papilem), and porcelain plates (afalaem), in order of decreasing frequency (and increas- ing value). They are the same valuables as those that are exchanged for life among hu- mans (in marriage exchanges, murder and adultery compensations, and so on). Since they stand for life, they are, in a sense, alive (see Valeri, "Notes on the Meaning" [n. 42 above]). But a valuable given to a spirit is forever removed from human use, it can never return as such, but only transformed into something vital. In this sense, the valuable is not just offered-it is "killed," symbolically destroyed. Indeed when a plate is offered it may be literally broken or cracked to mark its alienation from the human sphere. Such plates are then said to be maatae nika, "dead." Note that, however artificial these valu- ables may be, part of their efficacy as offerings resides in the fact that they evoke the successful subjugation of uncontrolled others, animal and human alike. The connection 125</page><page sequence="26">Hunting as Sacrifice may be provided by animals domesticated by the Huaulu (dog, chicken, and cat) or by any other people, for that matter.69 There are, or rather were, two kinds of blood sacrifices-that is, sac- rifices in which, according to the Huaulu themselves, the main source of efficacy was the spilling of blood (lasi). The first, and most impor- tant, was the sacrifice of "wild" humans-that is, of enemies or in any case of people who were not members of Huaulu society. The second was the sacrifice of wild animals (I have heard of wild pigs and eels) to make permanent peace between two communities that had been at war for a long time.70 A third, and more dubious, kind may be added: what seems like the offering of five makilem marsupials in the final banquet of the kahua feast, a practice that still occurs (see below). It may seem strange that I put the sacrifice of human outsiders to- gether with that of wild animals. But the close connection between them is indicated by the fact that the preferred victim in peacemaking sacrifices is a human, not an animal. The animal substitutes for the human.71 Analogously, it is likely that the five makilem that are-as it appears-the ancestors' share in the banquet symbolize the victimized enemy in displaced form. In any case, human victims share with animal ones the fact of being outsiders and even enemies and, of course, the fact of being hunted. Indeed the expression "head-hunt" is not inappro- priate in Huaulu, since they themselves speak of stealing (amana') peo- ple as they steal animals, and of their human victims as game (peni) or with wild animals is indicated by the belief that plates and other valuables-which are normally hidden in caches in the forest-have a tendency to turn into pigs, deer, and cas- sowaries. These may be wounded by the hunters and run back to the cache, where they retransform into valuables, and expire (they will then be found cracked, or "dead," as it is said). The connection of valuables and successfully hunted enemies is demonstrated by the fact that the head of an enemy could function as a substitute for bridewealth ac- cording to Huaulu traditions. The fundamental analogy between head and "hard" valu- ables such as plates and armshells is that-in the Huaulu view-they were all "stolen" (amanae) from enemies (and one should add that outsiders with whom no pact exists are ipso facto enemies for the Huaulu). Alternatively, they were obtained as blood money, that is, as ransom for prisoners of war, or as "protection price," for not raiding a certain people, or as payments for giving help in war. Valuables and heads are thus, one may say, enemy blood in different forms. 69 In this, Huaulu differ from some other peoples of Seram, including the neighboring people of Openg, who until recently used to sacrifice cocks in the course of the initiation of boys (now discontinued). 70 Each of the two parties held one side of the animal while they called on Lahatala and Puhum and their other ancestors to witness the swearing of the pact and to sanction it. The animal was then cut in two, as the Gordian knot of war itself (i toto lisam, "they cut the war"), and each party cooked and ate the half it was holding. After which if any of the two parties broke the peace they were "killed" (in the form of deadly misfortunes) by the guaranteeing powers that had been invoked. 71 In all of the most ancient instances of the rite, as reported in Huaulu historical nar- ratives, the victim was an old lady or, in the more serious cases, the nubile daughter of the Latunusa, the ritual chief of an autonomous community. These victims had to be provided by the losing side. 126</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions even meat (ayokuam). They also say that certain territories constitute their hunting grounds for procuring human victims. The expression head-hunt is inappropriate, however, if it suggests that only the head is the object of the hunt. In reality, the head is a token of the whole person and it is the latter, his blood and his flesh, that is indirectly offered to the "masters of the house," and in particular to Lahatala and Puhum, "to eat" (ala ia kae). Outsiders are offered to these spirits to eat in exchange for insiders, though, and from this point of view the efficacy of human victims lies precisely in their being human, not animal. It seems fair to say, then, that the whole point of choosing them is that they are both similar and dissimilar to the sacrifiers (the Huaulu) in a way that no animal can be. Nevertheless the fact that they are hunted, subjugated like animals, is absolutely crucial. Hunting is not just a practical preface to their sac- rifice-it is their sacrifice. It is, in fact, the most efficacious act of the ritual. The reason is that an analogy is established between the success- ful subjugation of a hostile force outside society and the subjugation of constantly angry and threatening spirits that are "bound" and "of the house" only for as long as they are fed human victims.72 Otherwise they eat the Huaulu. Indeed, it is to their inability to offer human sacrifices that the Huaulu attribute their present weakness and their frequent mis- fortunes: they are being "eaten" by their lords of the house-by the very powers that should make them strong and prosperous. These powers cannot give life except through the sacrificial principle-at the expense of some life. If it is not somebody else's, it must be the Huaulus'. The blood-sacrifice complex of the Huaulu was extremely compli- cated and I cannot treat it here even by way of summary. I only want to indicate, very briefly, that the appropriation of human victims and their incorporation into society closely parallels the appropriation and incor- poration of wild animals. In both cases, the induction stage is well de- veloped, due to the obvious fact that the victim must be found and subdued. But head-hunting is a much more elaborate process than hunt- ing, as one may expect from the fact that the stakes are much higher. The elements of struggle and reversibility are also much more developed than in hunting: struggle with an enemy who can always turn out to be the victor and struggle with rival headhunters. Indeed head-hunting was connected with a hierarchy of grades based on achievement.73 As in the hunt, the pursuit and capture of the victim were not viewed in purely 72 Thus it is subjugation (which implies a resisting, wild, opponent), rather than sub- jection (which implies a docile, domesticated, counterpart), that must characterize the re- lationship with the victim. 73 The number and quality of the heads taken (of children, women, and warriors, in rough order of increasing value) determined the grade to which a headhunter could as- pire. For instance, the grade kapitane required the killing of at least ten people. 127</page><page sequence="28">Hunting as Sacrifice pragmatic terms. The headhunter's success was determined by various personal spirits (nasinahem), who accompanied and guided him and who blinded and fooled the victim, just as in the hunting of animals. Other spirits (lusiem and atalayem) possessed the headhunter and gave him the invincibility, invulnerability, and especially the fury to kill as soon as a potential victim was spotted. In the Huaulu view, the head- hunter's consciousness was partly displaced by these spirits, who put him in a "trance." He was their tool: they wished to drink blood and to eat human flesh, thanks to his kill.74 The taking of life was immediately followed by, or even consisted of, the decapitation of the victim. As in the case of deer and wild pig, the head was reserved for the "lordly" spirits. The human carcass was abandoned without ceremony, though. None of it was eaten, except for sometimes some of the blood that dripped from the head. This blood was licked or mixed with some sagu and then eaten raw (it was taboo to cook on a head-hunt). Just like the hunter who had actually killed the animal, the headhunter who had killed the victim and "owned" the priv- ilege of carrying his head off was in a dangerous state of pollution- only much more serious. He could not enter the village before he had been purified in a stream by an elder who "had seen blood"-that is, a headhunter higher up in the hierarchical scale. The head itself had to be purified: it was oiled with candlenut oil to make it perfumed and to honor it. Otherwise, the headhunter could not be successful again. In former times, the head was brought into the village and it and the head- hunting party were welcomed with a number of rites, including presta- tions of valuables. The headhunter who "owned" the head rolled it on the floor of the village temple, where the "masters of the house" re- sided. The act signified that it had been offered to them as a token of a human life. A feast ensued during which men and women danced around the head all night long, sometimes for several months.75 The feast was (and is) called kahua, like this dance. At the end of the feast, the head was hung under the roof of the village temple, where it re- joined many others. Probably in the late nineteenth century, when ex- ternal intrusions from the colonial power made its public display risky, the head ceased to be brought into the village. It was left in an offering place in the forest, and what was brought into the village was only a to- ken of it, in the form of a leaf plucked from a wild plant (sokasoka) and a leaf from the croton bush (suli) that is planted near the village temple. This substitute formation nicely reveals an awareness of the composite 74 Thus these spirits were also "fed" by the Huaulu, albeit more passively than those to whom they presented the victims' heads in the village. 75 Valeri, "Autonomy and Heteronomy" (see n. 42 above). 128</page><page sequence="29">History of Religions nature of the human victim: it is both wild, of the outside, and-through its subjugation-tame, of the inside. It represents a transformation. Given this, it is not surprising that, while the head is offered in both cases, the greatest differences between hunting and head-hunting con- cern the treatment and destination of the offering. As I have indicated, the head of deer and wild pig is left unprocessed where the killing has occurred, that is, in the forest. The carcass is instead transformed and incorporated into the village for food. Just the opposite happens with human victims. The carcass is left behind, untouched, and the head is brought into the village, transformed and incorporated there as the "food" of the "masters of the house" spirits. There is, however, a par- tial overlapping between animal and human head if we take into ac- count that the lower jaw of the animal is treated in a way that is reminiscent of the way the human head is treated. Indeed, the jaw is brought back to the village, left on the shelf over the fireplace of the house of the hunter, and then hung under the roof, just like the human heads in the temple, for display. The consumption stage also seems different in the two processes of appropriation. In the head-hunt, this stage seems fused with the offering stage, since the only consumers of the victim are the spirits: there is no cannibalism. But things are not so simple. The consumption of human flesh by the spirit is metonymically associated with the consumption of animal flesh by humans in the kahua feast, and certain overlappings seem to exist. For instance, as I have mentioned, five marsupials of the makilam variety (Phalanger maculatus chrysorrhous) have to be pro- vided for the banquet that marks the end, and climax, of the kahua feast. There is more than one hint that these animals are associated with the offering of the enemy victim to the lords-of-the-house type of spir- its, whom the Huaulu also call ailaem, "ancestors." First of all, the makilam is the favorite transposition of the enemy headhunter in narra- tives. The reason, beside the animal's strikingly anthropomorphic as- pect, is its aggressiveness, which not infrequently provokes the fatal fall of the men who climb the trees to hunt it. So in a sense the dead makilem may be considered as the enemy victim in transposed form. Then their number, preparation, and consumption set them apart from all other meat consumed in the banquet and seem to indicate that they are consecrated to the ancestral powers just like the human victims. There must be five-and the use of this number is a standard ritual means of connecting with ancestral powers. They are smoked (just as the heads hung under the roof are smoked by the fires from the temple's kitchen), instead of being boiled or steamed, like all the other meat that is served at the banquet. Finally they may only be eaten by the male elders, who are said to be like ancestors among the living and who are 129</page><page sequence="30">Hunting as Sacrifice addressed and referred to with the same term (ailaem) that is employed for the ancestors. Thus, although there is no formal offering of these marsupials to the lords of the house that I could ascertain, they may be regarded as mediating between the human flesh that is the food of those lords exclusively and the cooked animal flesh that is the food of humans exclusively. Human consumption and ancestral consumption meet in the makilem; which are, therefore, the edible appendage of the hu- man victim. It is interesting that, while the human offering has disap- peared-at least officially-from the final banquet of the kahua feast, the five makilem must still be present-and I almost said presented. However this may be, in the past human and ancestral consumptions were linked through the idea that the abundant supply of meat at the ban- quet was due to ancestral intervention, itself motivated by pleasure at having been fed with human flesh. So humans ate, because the lords of the house ate. Not only were the hunt and the head-hunt similar in struc- ture, they also converged in the concluding banquet of the kahua feast. CONCLUSION: THE SPECTRUM OF SACRIFICE The intricate parallelisms, contrasts, and crisscrossings of what goes under the names of "hunt" and "head-hunt" confirm that, rather than radically opposing "ritual killing" to "sacrifice," it is better to use the latter as the name for the entire family of practices connected with the taking of life where this life, in its various forms, has strong symbolic significations and thus a certain quality of "forbiddenness" or, as it is also possible to say, "sacredness." As I indicated in Kingship and Sac- rifice,76 the symbolic character of animals especially, but also of plants and of artificial objects that stand for life, is an obstacle, but also a mo- tive, in their use. It is an obstacle, because they cannot be used in ways that contradict their symbolic associations. It is a motive, because their symbolic associations allow the use of animals, plants, and so on for symbolic purposes. In either case, consumption is not a matter of in- difference: it has to be justified by practices that make something of those symbolic associations-by "ritual." A basic polarity exists in the destiny of those associations in ritual. Either they are removed from most of the animal, or from the visible animal, to be concentrated in a part that remains forbidden because it remains symbolic; or they are, in contrast, accentuated and specified, to be put to work to some effect. In Kingship and Sacrifice, I identified the first pole with "genocentric sac- rifice" and the second with "nomocentric" and "ergocentric" sacrifices. The offering of the first part of the hunted deer and wild pig,77 and re- 76 Valeri, Kingship and Sacrifice (n. 1 above), pp. 70-83. 77 Also the analogous offering of the first fishes obtained from communal fish poison- ing, which I do not have space to treat here. 130</page><page sequence="31">History of Religions lated practices, of the Huaulu hunt are an instance of genocentric sac- rifice-that is, a sacrifice that is meant on the one hand to preserve the integrity of symbolic significations of an animal species (Gr. genos), and on the other to remove from the meat of an animal of that species the prohibition that is the consequence of those significations. The signification of the head is reinforced by the idea that it goes to a power-the lord of the forest-which is its counterpart. At the same time, this offering has a nomocentric (Gr. nomos, "law") dimension, in that it reproduces a moral relation with that power. It thus brings about a transformation not only in the meat, but also in the humans who eat it. The latter aspect, the victim-mediated transformation of sacrifiers through the transformation of their relationship with powers that repre- sent the moral laws of the society, is accentuated in such nomocentric sacrifices as those that are performed in Huaulu to turn enemies into friends. Here the eating of the animal victims is made possible not by the displacement of their symbolic value, but by the iconic use (separation and cutting of the wild self of the combatants) to which some of those symbolic values are put. Only the sacrifice of human victims-inedible for humans in Huaulu-can be purely symbolic, and thus purely no- mocentric, like the holocaust in other cultures. In the framework that I suggest, it makes little sense to identify sac- rifice solely with the use of domesticated animals and thus to consider it as the exclusive practice of settled agriculturalists and pastoralists (as suggested, more recently, by Smith).78 On the contrary, it is important to recognize that the sacrificial substances can be extremely diverse in every society and form a whole spectrum from the wild to the domes- ticated, from the unprocessed to the processed, from the natural to the artificial and, of course, from the nonhuman to the human. Only this spectrum is the fully appropriate unit of analysis, even where it is nec- essary to recognize that domesticated or, as in Huaulu, wild, victims predominate. But my purpose in this article was not to give a complete account of Huaulu sacrificial practices: it was to show that they are not incompatible with wild, hunted victims-and even that only such vic- tims are able to fully validate them.
