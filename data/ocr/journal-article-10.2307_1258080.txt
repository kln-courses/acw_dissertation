<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FOLKLORE OF BIRDS. An Enquiry into the Origin and Distribution of some Magico-Religious Traditions. By EDWARD A. ARMSTRONG. Collins, London, 1958. 30s. net. THOSE who heard Mr Armstrong address The Folk-Lore Society last November on A Technique for ascertaining the age of folklore will appreciate the breadth of research and the power of marrying divergent myths, legends and customs about selected bird themes into a coherent whole, here displayed. Mr Armstrong's aim is to trace the origin and transmission (or 'diffusion') of magico-religious beliefs, mostly in oral tradition, and mostly in Eurasia. His concern is with the folklore which is 'cult in decay'; and it is surprising how much of surviving belief, legend, and custom is indeed the distorted remains of ancient cults. Beginning with pre-history, as illustrated, for example, in 'the death of the bird man' in the rock painting of the Lascaux caves, the author selects for analysis such types of bird cults as The Michaelmas Goose, Bird Maidens, The Thunderbird (our Woodpecker), The Wren, and others of equal interest. Skilfully he traces the evidence backwards from our own day to ancient belief, and then, attractively, reverses his technique. He refers more than once to the view that primitive man did not regard himself as superior to the animal world; and it is well, especially for folklorists, to be reminded that man's assumption of superiority, or supremacy, over the rest of creation on earth is, in terms of Time, recent. Mr Armstrong thinks that animal, or theriomorphic, gods probably preceded anthropomorphic gods in man's religion. There are 55 excellent photographs, and 85 illustrations in the text. One striking photograph from a Sumerian clay tablet of 2300-2000 B.C. depicts a winged goddess standing on lions and with two rather subdued 352</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND NOTICES owls at her clawed feet. Apart from these appanages, the smiling goddess looks very anthropomorphic! There are also, a careful Bibliographical Index, a Select Bibliography, and a classified General Index.
