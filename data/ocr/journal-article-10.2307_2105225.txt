<plain_text><page sequence="1">"FREEDOM" IN ETHICS - A TRANSCAUSAL CONCEPT Human actions are often described as spontaneous. If we define sponta- neity as the faculty of some things to be active without being driven by outer mechanical forces, then this kind of spontaneity is a feature at least of all classes of living things. It is the particular feature of human action that it is conscious and capable of being self-controlled. There is also another concept of spontaneity, which refers to the impossibility of ex- plaining the whole field of experience and arriving at an absolute totality of the conditions in causal relations. "Reason creates for itself the idea of spontaneity, or the power of beginning by itself, without an antecedent cause determining it to action, according to the law of causal connexion. "I Immanuel Kant, who used this second concept of spontaneity, several times discusses the question of how far the behavior of the most developed living things, of men, can be called 'spontaneous' and expresses the follow- ing opinion: Every man as object of natural science has an empirical character of his (arbitrary) will, "which is nothing but a certain causality of his reason, exhibiting in its phenomenal actions and effects a rule, according to which one may infer the motives of reason and its actions, both in kind and in degree, and judge of the subjective principles of his will. As that empirical character must be derived from phenomena, as an effect, and from their rule which is supplied by experience, all the acts of a man, so far as they are phenomena, are determined from his empirical character and from the other concomitant causes, according to the order of nature; and if we could investigate all the manifestations of his will to the very bottom, there would be not a single action which we could not predict with certainty and recognize from its preceding conditions as necessary."2 This sentence of Kant may be regarded as a completion of the Laplacean doctrine as to the ascertainability of the course of nature in principle by means of a vast intelligence. The question of the origin of the empirical character is in the view of a determinist sufficiently ex- plained by the description of hereditary factors and the educational influences of the environment. However it is impossible to confirm or to deny the sentence in the sphere of our experience since the necessary investigation of the manifestations of the will of a man to its origin would transcend the limits of experience. But the idea expressed by Kant is connected with his assumption of a total causality of nature, being an a 1 Kant, The Critique of Pure Rea8on, B. 561, trans. by Max.

Consequently he defines his concept of freedom, which forms the center of his system, in a manner which makes it consistent with the total causality of nature, as an idea which cannot be examined. The principle of a total causality of nature has been a- bandoned today. Who would still think it possible to explain the course of nature and the phenomena of nature in their variety by a kind of con- tinuous chain of reactions? But if we admit that nature is changing dis- continuously, we admit at least that spontaneity is a possible cause in the course of nature. Also, in non-living nature events occur whose determining factors, if there are determining factors at all, have no mechanical charac- ter. Therefore the question arises whether by dismissing the assumption that nature is totally caused we do not open the possibility of giving a foundation to the concept of the freedom of will within the limits of our experience. In answering the question it is the intention of the present essay to show that the undetermined factors of chance which possibly are efficient throughout nature as well as in the biography of men and nations, are not able to vindicate the idea that man has freedom of decision. This idea does not describe a part of reality, it is merely a postulate, which presupposes certain properties of human activity, like consciousness and the faculty of self-control - properties, even, which have nothing at all to do with random phenomena and chance, but of course belong to the subtle nature of human character. Therefore it has been said that the transcendental method of Kant, and - it should be added - particularly his distinction between the 'Being' and the 'Ought,' has a lasting importance in a time which abandons physical determinism. The present writer accepts this opinion, thinking that necessary modifications in the transcendental method may be required by several criticisms of the Kantian concepts, but never by the admission of physical chance and never by the low degree of predictability of human decisions. Kant distinguishes in his 'Critique of Pure Reason' between "freedom in its cosmological meaning" and "freedom in its practical meaning." "Freedom in its cosmological meaning [is] the faculty of beginning a state spontaneously." Kant introduces here an element of pure fiction, a limiting concept, which is not connected at all with any kind of experience and forms a conception which cannot be an object of research and explanation because 'explanation' involves terms of causality, but which are excluded in the quoted definition of 'spontaneity.' Now Kant maintains that it is very curious, that this transcendental idea of freedom forms the foun- dation of the practical concept of freedom. "Freedom in its practical sense" is, according to the definition of Kant, "the independence of our 3 Ibid., cf. 1.</page><page sequence="3">"FREEDOM" IN ETHICS- A TRANSCAUSAL CONCEPT 343 will from the coercion through sensual impulses."3 This idea of freedom has no lesser function than to be connected with the basic assumptions, which vindicate human moral feeling and its bearing upon ethics of religion or ethics of responsibility and upon legal order. It may be that this idea is too narrow to fulfill this function in general. In any case, it serves as a foundation of the ethics of pure will, which is postulated in the categorical imperative. For that will is 'pure', which is free from coercion by sensual impulses, so that it can direct action in such a manner that the actor may wish the directing motives of his action to become general maxims. However, a concept of freedom which is in accordance with the general feeling of morals also forms the foundation of liabilities and responsibilities of the actor if human actions are codetermined by sensual impulses. If we assume now, in accordance with modern science, that "freedom in its cosmological meaning" is not only not fictive, but actually occurs in nature, it is conceivable that this occurrence could explain the concept of freedom which we need, instead of the Kantian freedom in its practical sense, in any system that satisfies the general feeling of morals. But the attempt to reduce freedom in its practical meaning to freedom in its cosmological meaning fails here. We can easily find examples of this failure by comparing natural phenomena with the behavior of man: Someone has compared the "drunkard's walk"4 with the capricious movements of molecules described in the kinetic theory of matter, which, for example, Brown observed in Chlorophyll and other liquids. The drunkard can be distinguished from the sober man, if his intoxication reaches a certain degree, by the confusion of his consciousness and his loss in ability to direct his behavior in accord- ance with his intentions, and therefore his behavior becomes capricious and his movements are unpredictable in their details. But consciousness and intentional behavior, which are dimmed in the case of the drunkard, are the characteristics of the responsible action of man. A further con- dition of a man's responsibility for his action, is that he could act otherwise than he did. This condition virtually excludes actions which are caused by threats and outer coercion, but not the reasonable behavior of a man which is motivated by outer circumstances, as, for example, if one feels compelled to sell his house in order to pay his debts. In these cases is the principle of the civil law valid which assumes for the mind of the actor: "Quamquam coactus, tamen volui." Conscious and intentional behavior are the characteristics of the free man and they were summed up by Goethe as the ability to distinguish, to choose, and to judge. But the behavior of the drunkard is directed by chance, like the behavior of Brown's molecules. As to the drunkard, 4 Cf. G. Gamow, One, Two, Three, Infinity, Mentor Books, 1953, pp. 91 f.</page><page sequence="4">344 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the saying may be applied: "Our first step may be free, but in our further steps we are slaves." 5 The drunkard was free to remain sober, but being intoxicated he became a slave. I.e., we deny even the freedom of man in his fortuitous behavior. So we observe that freedom in its cosmological meaning, if it is equivalent to 'chance,' contradicts that kind of freedom which is presupposed by every system of values. For the idea of ethical freedom which is connected with the presentation of a consciously acting man has nothing to do with chance or spontaneity, if these concepts involve the lack of complete explanation of phenomena by causes. Con- sciously acting man certainly does not act fortuitously, the conditions which determine his behavior are only not mechanical - they are rather "motives," i.e., in principle intentional reasoning, which may be directed by various factors, including sensual impulses, and it is the task of psycho- logy to describe the cooperation of all these factors. Sober and consciously acting man is determined not by the mechanical causes known to us in inorganic nature, but by intentions which involve purposes and the class of purposes or motives is a subclass of the class of causes. The question of whether human behavior is continuously determined, is quite another question than the question of whether a man is to be held responsible for his action, it is a question which cannot be decided in individual cases, as it cannot be decided whether the vast intelligence, which Laplace imagined, really could calculate the future and the past of the universe from the presence of one single instant. Though the question, if in the singular case the behavior of a man is determined in full or if also fortuitous factors contribute to his conscious behavior, cannot be decided, the discontinuity of the course of nature shows that genuine spontaneity is a possible factor in the determination of both living and non-living things. Our ignorance seems to prevent us from making hyphotheses re- garding the occurrence of genuine spontaneity which are capable of being verified, but it is sometimes assumed that, e.g., the behavior of significant personalities involves genuine spontaneity. If this assumption is correct, we may find, at least in one particular case, a connection between free- dom in its cosmological meaning and moral freedom. But even this assumption cannot be verified, if we consider that the performances of great personalities must be based on hereditary inclinations. If we had found here a verifiable hypothesis we could say that the will of important men like Richard and Henry is free, but the will of the mediocre Charles and Alfred is not. Such distinctions are incorrect, since a valuation of any personality does not depend on whether his behavior is fully explic- able by causes or motives, but rather depends on his effects on the social environment and on the impression he makes on his fellow-beings. Some 5 "Das erste steht uns frei, beim zweiten sind wir Knechte." Goethe's Faust, line 1412.</page><page sequence="5">"FREEDOM" IN ETHICS- A TRANSCAUSAL CONCEPT 345 eminent bent of mind at the wrong time or in a wrong environment may remain ineffectual or may fail to receive due valuation. On the other hand, there are cases, e.g., of political efficiency, which are capable of being explained primarily by the fact that the ground was as it were, prepared for them. Therefore the reference to significant personalities is only meaningful in this connection in that it demonstrates in a conspicuous manner the possible variety in the growth of individual inclinations and characters. The amount of variety in nature makes it likely that genuine spontaneity interacts with natural causes. But neither the significance of personalities nor the ideas of freedom and responsibility are capable of being explained by the-occurrence of chance. We observe further, that human actions are considered under different aspects: an idiographic aspect, which makes us consider human actions free and the actor responsible for his actions, and a nomothetic aspect, namely the aspect of psychologists, which considers the whole complex of mo- tivation in its connection with anthropological lawfulness. Therefore the dualism of the world of values and the world of experience, which belongs to the essential doctrines of Kant and his pupils, reveals itself as a differ- ence in possible aspects. Only this dualism makes us conceive the postulate of ethical freedom. We dismiss Kant's assumption as to the constitutive meaning of the principle of causality. We also do not accept his curious connection between ethical freedom, freedom in its practical meaning, and freedom in its cosmological meaning. But we acknowledge, that if we are not entirely skeptical as to the possible foundation of ethical values, there must be a valid system of values, methodically distinguished from the world of reality and that in the construction of any system of values the assumption of man's freedom of action is necessary. Even men who say that they do not need hypotheses of the existence of God and of the immortality of the human soul generally hold that ethical valuation is possible, that man knows how to distinguish between good and evil. How are we to imagine a society which admits skepticism as to our possible knowledge of ethical values ? Would it motivate its sytem of justice merely by frightening would-be transgressors of a legal order which a sovereign or a dominant class had imposed on it? Political leaders of social units, if they are skeptics, will endeavor to conceal their real opinion and will offer their people not only a system of ethical valuation, but a more or lefs disguised religion too. And so-called free-thinkers, e.g. monists, logical positivists, and others who deny the assumptions of faith are in most cases sincere in admitting that they adhere to a system of ethical valuation, e.g., some utilitarian ethics of responsibility. The assumption of the responsibility of the actor, however, presupposes freedom of action as the leading idea of practical reason. We have distinguished this idea from the idea of genuine sponta-</page><page sequence="6">346 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH neity and we have to distinguish it also from the ideas of political freedom. These ideas mean freedom from external coercion, if such coercion is not restricted to the power of a state which is founded on the sovereignty of its own people. But there are many other political ideas which are pro- pagated as the real content of the idea of human freedom. The concept of freedom is ambiguous, for man is necessarily subjected to natural and social determinations. If a person refers to the concept of freedom he must indicate the freedom from which possible determination he has in mind. Kant did this in contrasting the transcendental idea of freedom with impulses of sensuality. But the idea of freedom upon which the responsibility of the consciously acting individual is based, means, in accordance with the saying of Nietzsche in his Zarathustra, not so much freedom from some coercion as freedom to do something. ('Frei wovon? Was schiert das Zarathustra! Hell aber soil mir Dein Auge kuenden: frei wozu?')6. We postulate the freedom of the consciously acting individual only in order to subject him to the prevailing opinion which gives him the faculty of distinguishing between right and wrong and appoints him as the judge upon himself and the avenger of his own law. It should be remarked that 'free from' and 'free to' are different concepts in English particularly. In German it is not usual, to say "I am free to go abroad" instead of "ich habe die Mtglichkeit in das Ausland zu gehen," but it is possible and this possibility in the use of language is applied in the saying of Nietzsche. English authors, e.g., Charles Morgan in Liberties of the Mind, distinguish between various liberties. There are liberties "not to despair," "to build," "of teaching," and many others, including both the liberty from materialism and the liberty to ask questions.7 In general no system of morals or justice can be constructed withQut properly defining the concept of freedom involved in it. E.g., a system of criminal laws assumes as the characteristics of voluntary action that the action was executed by some actor, not a minor, whose consciousness is not temporarily or permanently disturbed and who is not subjected to outer coercion. All other determinations, the real motives of the action, as connected with want of food, the sexual impulse, etc., are important for the judgment of some singular case, but not for the codified law. Freedom of action and the responsibility of the actor are assumed, if the general definition of these concepts is satisfied, and the explanation of actions by motives does not cancel the responsibility of the actor, neither in a system 6 Nietzsche, Zarathustra, Vom Wege des Scha/ffenden, (The Way of the Creating one): "Free from what?

This question of general moral feeling and legal definitions is a quaestio juris, or, as Vaihinger maintained, the question of a valid fiction; whereas the question of whether the course of nature is totally determined or if spontaneity is a codetermining factor in it must be conceived as a quaestio fact, which has no logical connection whatever with the answer to the quaestio juris. It must be emphasized that it was principally the philosophy of Immanuel Kant - despite all modern criticisms of this philosophy, which seem to be necessary - which taught us to distinguish in our thought between questions about reality, or Being, and questions about the Ought, about valid principles, to contrast the consideration of nature and the consideration of purposes. Practical considerations connect in the realm of our ethics our assump- tions of values with outer reality. But it is not the intention of this essay to discuss utilitarian or other ethical theories. However in this connection may be mentioned the doctrine that many of our assumptions - among others, the concept of freedom in the general feeling of morals - may be incorrect, or not in correspondence with facts, but that they are justly employed from reasons of expediency, they are inserted as useful fictions. That is Vaihinger's philosophy of the 'As If.' In opposition to this doctrine the present writer is of the opinion that even the problem of freedom of action is capable of being understood, if we admit that there are various possible aspects for every natural or mental phenomenon and that such aspects neither contradict one another nor reality. Also, the totality of the motives of a man, the so-called will, is one of the things which are capable of being considered in different aspects. The assertion that the will is free does not mean that it is uncaused. Schopenhauer said, "Man can do what he will, but he cannot will what he will."8 This sentence seems to be a paradox, but the paradox is easily dissolved by the inter- pretation, that the word "will" is used in this sentence in different meanings. We may say more correctly, "Man acts voluntarily, i.e., directed by his volitions, but his volitions are not unmotivated or uncaused." Schopenhauer was of the opinion, first that sensual impulses may be stronger motives than rational considerations - an opinion, which is involved in the doctrine as to the primacy of the will over the intellect - and, secondly, that man is determined by his inborn character. As to the first thesis we may say that indeed reason is in most cases only the means to serve our impulses. But we do not know if the second thesis, on the full determination of man by his inborn character, is correct, and general considerations show that the coefficiency of genuine spontaneity is at 8 Cf. Schopenhauer's Preisschrift, ' Ueber die Freiheit des Willems' in Gesamtauqgaben.</page><page sequence="8">348 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH least probable. We have already shown that for the assumption of ethical freedom the dispute between determinists and indeterminists is entirely irrelevant. Under the aspect of the exploration of causes we have no experience which could verify the assumption of spontaneity of the acting man; but on the other hand, the assumption of freedom is in accordance with the subjective feeling of the deciding man, so long as he is not subject to outside coercion. The experience of freedom has "subjective evidence," to go back to the idea originated by Aquinas, which is, in Brentano's term, an inner perception. In consequence of an analogy - which forms the methodological foundation of psychology - we assume that our fellow- beings have the same experience that we have. Here we have substituted for the exploration of causes the observation and description of the sub- jective experiences of men. This is the idiographic aspect, already mention- ed. If, however, we do not justify this aspect by constructing a system of ethical values, then the objection is possible that this aspect belongs more to poetry than to science in the narrower sense, since nomothetic science in general and particularly psychology involves the exploration of causes. The justification of the aspect of freedom by the construction of a system of values is a way of thinking applied not only in morals. The purpose of every system of normative principles may be conceived as its principal cause, and we may say in general that the systems of rules which man has created fulfill the function of a well-ordered social life. Thus the concept of function in anthropology as well as in biology means a synthesis of the concepts of purpose and of cause. Ernst Cassirer distinguished between statistical and ethical freedom thus: "From the significance of freedom, as a mere possibility limited by natural laws, there is no way to that "reality" of volition and freedom of decision with which ethics is concerned. To mistake the choice (Auswahl) which an electron according to Bohr's Theory has between different quantum orbits, with a choice (Wahl) in the ethical sense of this concept, would mean to become a victim of a purely linguistic equivocality. To speak of an ethical choice there must not only be different possibilities but a conscious distinction between them and a conscious decision about them. To attribute such acts to an electron would be a gross lapse into a form of anthropomorphism.9 Concerning the inverse problem whether the 'freedom' of the electron helps us to understand the freedom of volition he said this: "It is of no avail whether causality-in nature is regarded in the form of rigorous "dynamical" laws or of merely statistical laws... In neither way does there remain open an access to that sphere of 'freedom' which is claimed by ethics." It belongs to the thesis of this essay to assert, 9 The quotations from Cassirer's Determinism8M und Indeterminimus8 in der Mo- dernen Phy8ik are translated in M. Born, Natural Philosophiy of Cau'se.and Chance, Oxford, 1949, pp. 208 f.</page><page sequence="9">"FREEDOM" IN ETHICS- A TRANSCAUSAL CONCEPT 349 moreover, that even possible gaps in the determination of man's behavior do not open an access to the understanding of ethical freedom.Such possible gaps may be explained by the individual formation of human characters or - like other random phenomena - by faith in destiny, in arbitrary acts of demons'0 or in Providence, in Divine will. The opinion of Cassirer has been endorsed by natural scientists such as Max Born, Erwin Schroedinger"l and Philipp Frank.'2 (Henry Margenau wrote a preface to the quoted book of Cassirer, Determinism and Inde- terminism in Modern Physics, published in English by Yale University in 1956.) It is the rejection of the attempt, which Eddington and others made, to explain the freedom of human will by microphysics.'3 In recent philosophy it was Nicolai Hartmann who developed a view which is nearly akin to the view of Kant. In the opinion of Hartmann the world is causally determined, but the problem of freedom must be understood in a way which is not affected by the dispute between deter- minism and indeterminism. This freedom is - if we reapply a term of Hartmanns Metaphysik der Erkenntnis - transcausal. If causal deter- mination is not conceived in a monistic way, then natural lawfulness nowhere contradicts positive freedom. On the other hand, freedom of will implies, not a decrease, but an increase of determination; a "plus" of determination from the sphere of values deflects the results of the natural causes which determine human actions. Hartmann even said that only in a determined world, is his 'freedom' - which -is involved in the purposeful action of a moral being subjected to autonomous orders - possible at all.'4 Only a shade distinguishes his justification of ethical values from moral skepticism. In the discussion on the validity of values and of the as- sumption of the freedom of will according to Hartmann scepsis has the more weighty onus probandil5 since in the phenomenon of decision the 10 Cf.

There is no logical contradiction and quantum physics has no bearing on the question of human freedom. 14 Cf.

The present writer makes use of this term in order to indicate that 'ethical freedom' has nothing to do with the problem of causal determinism, but is an idea connected with a rational modification of the conditions which determine human actions.</page><page sequence="10">350 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH actor seems to be free. As to the concept of freedom used in forming ethical systems the present writer holds a view which seems to be similar to the view of Hartmann, but he disagrees with Hartmann's theory of causal determination and thinks that the question of whether nature is fully determined is entirely irrelevant to the assumption of ethical freedom. Human determination is modified by those properties of human behavior which are to be connected with this assumption. If somebody knows what he does, then this knowledge means a rational modification of his impulses. It is this faculty of the intellect to modify the impulses of man which is the factual presupposition to the introduction of the normative ideas of human autonomy and ethical freedom. The intention of this essay would, however, be misunderstood if the psychological problems which are involved in the following arguments were to become the subject matter of discussion. We contrasted possible gaps in causality with a postulate of ethical freedom, which belongs to every non-skeptical ethics, and have seen that these ideas are mutually independent. Therefore the question is irrelevant whether the causality of the behavior of a drunkard or of Raskolnikov really contains gaps. We have already said that this quaestio fact cannot be decided in individual cases. We see that the old problem represented in religious philosophy by men like St. Augustine and Maimonides, how to reconcile doctrines on God's foreknowledge and omniscience with the postulate of human freedom, can be conceived as a different formulation of our central question, since the assumption of omniscience and foreknowledge seem to involve a deterministic view. Philosophers offer various solutions to this problem. In the view of Augustine men and angels have freedom of will - which contradicts the Stoic conception of Fate. And these beings are capable of being free because God knows our sins without their being caused by his knowledge. God merely foresees the choices that man will freely make. God's enemies are not so by nature, but by will. The vicious will has no efficient cause, but only a deficient one; it is not an effect, but a defect. Analysis of the opinions of St. Augustine would scarcely prove their logical consistency, but logical consistency is not required in most meta- physical systems.'6 Hobbes said, concerning the connection between scientific determinism and faith in God, the following: "This concourse of causes, whereof everyone is determined to be such as it is by a like concourse of former causes, may well be called (in respect they were all set and ordered by the eternal cause of all things, God Almighty) the decree of God."'7 And this ingenious philosopher has already said that free-will means only the lack 16 On the view of Augustine cf. B. Russell, History of Western Philosophy, pp. 377 f. 17 Quoted in Hobbes by R. Peters, Pelican ed., 1956, p. 184.</page><page sequence="11">"FREEDOM" IN ETHICS- A TRANSCAUSAL CONCEPT 351 of certain kinds of constraint, but never the lack of causality. The step is very small indeed to a philosophy which asserts that the lack of some constraint is the presupposition of a pragmatical assumption of freedom in a system of values. In comparison with the causal-determinism of Hobbes, views such as Augustine's seem to be indeterministic. The Jewish philosopher Maimonides held an even more indeterministic view, for he said that the knowledge of God is a knowledge of some other kind than human knowledge. "The Lord knows nothing with a knowledge separated from His Existence. With Him is Being and Knowledge One."'8 And the power of action lies in the hand of man and man will once have to justify himself. This was the general view of most philosophers of religion and this view seems to explain the fact that even in times of development of a rigid scientific determinism, as in the time of the development of classical physics, human bodies were exempted from physical determinism. There can be no inconsistency between facts. And the assertion of ethical freedom is rightly understood only if it is conceived as some kind of valuation, which asserts nothing about facts, but presupposes some factual conditions. We may think that the question about the determin- ism of nature is today decided by the evident discontinuity of the course of nature, or believe that the course of nature is principally determined by the tendency to maximal entropy, but this question is entirely irrele- vant to ethical freedom, ethical freedom being transcausal. In the realm of moral and social order the assumption of ethical free,. dom is connected with some systematic, non-skeptical valuation of human actions. To know the distinction between good and evil, between just and unjust, demands the assumption of freedom and responsibility. It is not the intention of this essay to give a foundation of ethical values and to discuss the important questions which are involved in ethics and in the philosophy of moral and legal order. Possibly the impulsive will to live and the rational reverence for life, which means reverence for the life of fellow-beings too, may give us the right foundation for moral feeling, and for the assertion of that autonomy of man which is postulated by holding him free and responsible. This is also the leading principle in the ethics and works of Albert Schweitzer, but we may say that the Ten Commandments already included this principle among other rules. Finally the question has to be discussed whether logical positivism is necessarily connected with ethical skepticism, i.e., with the view that we are really ignorant about the distinction between ethical values. Logical positivism allows only for the truth of logical consistency in deductive reasoning and for the truth of the correspondence of our as- 18 Cf. Rabbi Mosche ben Maimon, selections by Glatzer, Schocken, 1935, p. 39.</page><page sequence="12">352 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH sertions with the experience of facts. And assertions which do not belong to a system of pure science and do not have the meaning of assertions of facts may, in the opinion particularly of Rudolf Carnap, express some feeling of life, but not a meaningful assertion of any kind.'9 It seems that in accordance with this opinion assertions of man's freedom and responsi- bility and of the validity of morals have no other than emotive meaning, like interjections and weeping or laughter, which express our feelings of sorrow or joy. It must be added that assertions on the pragmatical value of human organizations and systems of order are admitted by logical positivists as a subclass of assertions about facts, a kind of assertion which has its place, if we make a division of the sciences, entirely in social science. I.e., the practical value of our morals is not denied, it is even capable of being verified by human experience. And there seems to arise the question which arises in systems of utilitarian ethics, too, namely, whether it is the interest of the individual or more the interest of human society or of some part of it which determines the practical value of our social order (in the widest sense of this concept); and related questions refer to the equal or unequal value of human races, as their skin may be white or black. It seems quite impossible to conceive a general doctrine of values, i.e., to prove the objectivity of what we have called 'pragmatical value' by means of our experience. On the other hand, the attempt of rationalists, who assert that the doctrine of ethics is of logical origin, seems to have failed, for it is im- possible to make plausible the transition from logical propositions to ought-sentences or valuations without inserting an axiology which is arbitrary in principle,20 and may already contain the leading principles of the whole system. Nevertheless, that kind of logical positivism which admits value judgments only as ejaculations, i.e., expressions of our different feelings at different space-time points of our life, is certainly wrong. The rational content of value judgments cannot be denied, even if we confess that it is difficult to avoid ambiguity in such judgments. For ambiguity in certain of our expressions is something other than the ejaculatory character of some expressions. Ambiguous propositions are not without cognitive meaning. Unambiguity may be attained by the insertion of adequate definitions. Hence the problem of valuation will be reduced to the attempt to find an agreement among the possible definitions of values, and to find the 'right' basis of objectivation or 'axiology.' In many cases modern foundations of ethics are at most to be distinguish- 19 Cf. Carnap, "Ueberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache," Erkenntnis, 1931, p. 219. 20 Cf. the discussions on this problem in Mises, Positivism, Cambridge, 1951, p. 325.</page><page sequence="13">"FREEDOM" IN ETHICS- A TRANSCAUSAL CONCEPT 358 ed from relativism and skepticism in the same degree as the view of Nicolai Hartmann: by a shade. But the proof of this assertion as to consistent utilitarianism or consistent hedonism or as to the intuitionist foundation of ethics is not the task of this paper. It was already the result of Husserl's reduction of normative to theoretical propositions to understand that just as in pure geometry so in ethics different systems are capable of being formed, being distinguished in the first order by the choice of different axioms. It would be seen that ethical propositions are valid within their own system and that the formal validity of the propositions remains unaffected by their application or realization in actual conditions.21 HAIFA, ISRAEL.
