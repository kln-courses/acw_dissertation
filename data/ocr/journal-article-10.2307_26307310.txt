Guderjan Anthropology Program, St. Mary's University, San Antonio, TX 78228, USA Abstract Archaeological fieldwork was conducted on Ambergris Caye, Belize, for three years beginning in 1986. Nineteen archaeological sites were identified during survey work. Intensive excavations were conducted at three sites and limited excavation at several others. In addition, a fourth site has been excavated by another party. This data base gives us the opportunity to examine the diachronic and functional variability of the archaeological record. The first occupation of Ambergris Caye dates to the Late Pre classic, and by the Early Classic a pattern had begun to form that continued until the Terminal Classic. Sites on the island's protected leeward side participated in a growing and thriving coastal-trade network. At the same time, sites on the unpro tected Caribbean coast did not have the same access to exotic goods and did not build formal architecture. Trade-related sites are relatively closely spaced, about 5 km, and exhibit no evi dence of conflict. The Ambergris data show that a much more vibrant trade system existed during the Late Classic period than has been previously known. At the end of the Classic period, a fundamental restructuring of life on Ambergris Caye seems to have occurred. Coastal margin sites that had been involved with the trade system were largely abandoned. While some of this activity seems to have been consolidated at the site of Marco Gonzalez, a new settle ment pattern also emerged. By the Early Postclassic, an adapta tion based on terrestrial rather than maritime resources developed in the northern interior of Ambergris Caye. This restructuring is coincidental with the restructuring of the Maya political and economic situation in the southern lowlands and gives us a new perspective from which to view the institutional organization of the Maya. The ancient Maya used the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and Belize as a primary commercial route. While peripheral to the major Maya population centers, events in the coastal area provide an important window into Maya eco nomic and political organization. By viewing the Maya from this perspective and correlating events to those in the major popu lation centers, it is possible to gain a clearer insight into the insti tutional framework of the society. In this paper, the status of our information regarding the events and dynamics of the Maya settlement of Ambergris Caye, off the coast of northern Belize, is summarized. This informa tion is then used to illuminate the dynamics of Maya coastal trade and political economy. Much of the data presented here were collected during several seasons of survey and excavation beginning in 1986, under the direction of the author and his codirectors, James F. Garber and Herman A. Smith (Guderjan and Garber 1995). Additional information derives from the work of Elizabeth Graham and David Pendergast (1989) on the southern part of the island. Maya coastal settlement and the implications of patterning in that settlement have been the focus of considerable attention over the past two decades (Freidel and Sabloff 1984; Hammond 1976; McKillop 1987; Sabloff and Rathje 1975; among others). Ambergris Caye, however, offers special opportunities for understanding coastal settlement systems. Unlike most of the coast, where all settlement functions needed to be arranged lineally along the coastline, Ambergris' physiography enabled the Maya to functionally separate site locations in an observ able way. Information from the Cozumel Project indicated that mari time trade increased in importance during the Postclassic (Sabloff and Rathje, eds. 1975). On Cozumel, population dramatically increased as did trade-related activities during the Postclassic. Consequently, when the Ambergris Project began, it was ex pected that relatively little evidence for Classic-period trade would be found and that trade as an organizing principal for the island's settlement would not become apparent until the Post classic. Instead, the Ambergris record shows rich evidence of a very active, Late Classic period trade system. While similar results were being uncovered by McKillop (1980) at Moho Caye near the mouth of the Belize River and MacKinnon (1989) at Placencia along the southern Belize coast, the Ambergris data more clearly reflect the shifting dynamics of the trade system. GEOGRAPHY OF AMBERGRIS CAYE Ambergris Caye forms a barrier between the open Caribbean Sea and the Chetumal Bay system (Figure 1). The Rio Hondo and New River drain into Chetumal Bay and its smaller south ern extension, Corozal Bay. Along these bays and rivers are found many of the larger and more important prehistoric com munities of the region. Thus, these waterways form important commercial routes. Ambergris Caye is misnamed, for it is not actually an island but an extension of the Xkalak Peninsula. Ambergris is sepa 147</page><page sequence="2">148 Guderjan Figure 1. Locational map of Ambergris Caye. rated from the rest of the peninsula and Mexico by a very narrow channel, the Bacalar Chico, which may have been constructed by the Maya no later than a.d. 600 and perhaps considerably earlier (Guderjan 1988; Guderjan and Garber 1995). Neverthe less, Ambergris is commonly considered to be an island (Wood et al. 1988) and will be termed as such in this paper. Ambergris is about 30 km long, and not wider than 4 km at any point (Figure 2). It roughly parallels the barrier reef with a general north-south orientation. Today, as in the past, the reef is perhaps the most important aspect of the island's geography. The reef protects the beach from the open sea and provides abundant marine resources. Waves that commonly exceed 3 m in the open sea are diminished to less than 1 m behind the reef. Between the reef and land, waters are also quite shallow, typi cally 3-7 m, and crystal clear. Immediately outside of the reef, the depth often exceeds 40-50 m. Consequently, Maya canoe traders normally plied the calm coastal waters between the reef and the land. It was not until the Postclassic period that much evidence exists for use of the deep-water cays of southern Belize (MacKinnon 1989) or even for intense activity on the island of Cozumel (Sabloff and Rathje, eds. 1975), which also required journeys beyond the reef. One of the most important anomalies along the entire Quin tana Roo-Belize-Honduras coast is found at Rocky Point on Ambergris.

While this makes for spectacular scenery, this convergence was disruptive to coastal-trade routes. In order to avoid ventures outside of the reef, the Maya may have dug the Bacalar Chico passage at the narrowest point of the Xkalak Peninsula. The evidence for the Bacalar Chico channel being open in pre-Columbian times is circumstantial but compelling. The pres ence of San Juan and Chac Balam along the channel route com bined with the quantities of exotic goods found at those sites indicate a linkage with the maritime trade, which seems extremely unlikely unless they were directly connected with the open seas (Driver 1991; Driver et al. 1995). Also, a deposit of "killed" conch dating to approximately a.d. 600 was found at San Juan (Guderjan 1988). These were used for food, but not as tools. The idea of carrying conch in their shells across the island is also very unlikely. However, bringing them by boat is much more feasible. Further, conch cannot live in the bottom sediments on the west side of the island and can only live on the floor of the open seas. Archival records also indicate that the channel was open at an early date. The channel was certainly open in 1783 when it</page><page sequence="3">Maya settlement and trade 149 was used as the international border as declared by the Treaty of Versailles and was subsequently mapped (Bay-Man of Hon duras 1787). As early as 1726, the channel was open and con sidered to be the direct route into Chetumal and Lake Bacalar, and by 1726, the Spanish had blocked a preexisting natural or human-made channel from Chetumal Bay to Lake Bacalar (Grant Jones, personal communication 1991). Therefore, doc umentary evidence also supports a date of at least early Colo nial and probably pre-Columbian times. Offshore resources and opportunities are related to wind ward- vs. leeward- side location. The windward side of the island is where prevailing winds strike. In this case, the prevail ing wind comes from the Caribbean Sea to the coast, and the eastern or beach side of the island is the windward side. The bar rier reef is also on this side of the island and presented another suite of resources. The "back," or western side, is the leeward side. Water salinity is much lower on the leeward side than the windward because of the freshwater brought into the bay sys tem by the New River and the Rio Hondo. Also, bottom sedi ments differ greatly. Ambergris' terrestrial environmental zones are defined by the height of the underlying limestone plate. At the lowest level, where the limestone is submerged, are the interior lagoons that actually comprise the bulk of the island's mass. Adjacent to them are extensive mangrove swamps. These swamps are cru cial to the marine-life ecosystems and often nearly impassable. A "mangrove walk" commonly means carefully climbing on mangrove "hoops," 2 m above ground, for long distances. In areas that are not generally flooded and that have elevations less than approximately 3 m above sea level, savannah vegetation such as salt grass is found. Finally, in the highest elevations, over approximately 3 m above sea level, the low scrub forest of northern Belize dominates the landscape. Archaeological sites found in mangrove environments are generally easily located as they are slightly elevated because of the substructures built by the Maya that support forest vegeta tion can be seen from some distance. Typically, they are ringed with a narrow transition zone of savannah vegetation. On the other hand, small sites in the scrub forest or modern coconut plantations are extremely difficult to locate. Along the entire windward coastline is the beach that extends 30-50 m from the water. Typically, a relict beach is seen behind today's beach, probably from a time of higher relative sea level. Currently, the beach is slowly eroding away as sea level rises. Dunn and Mazzulo (1993) documented a local sea-level rise of about 30 cm over the past 2,100 years. However, in southern Belize, Heather McKillop (1987, 1994, 1995, 1995b) has found a number of sites submerged under three to four times as much water. Similarly, she found Classic-period materials under more than 1 m of water at Moho Cay (McKillop 1981). On Amber gris, Yalamha, an Early Classic site, is submerged under more than I m of water (Guderjan 1993). Deposits dating prior to a.d. 670 Â± 70 (TX-5658) were found at San Juan that were approximately 60-70 cm below current groundwater levels (Guderjan 1988). In addition, Dunn and Mazzulo's study also runs contrary to evidence from Cerros (Scarborough 1991), the apparently submerged Postclassic seawall at Isla Cerritos (Andrews et al. 1988), and Placencia (MacKinnon 1989). Scar borough (1991) summarized much of the evidence for sea-level rise or land subsidence in his monograph on the canals and set tlement of Cerros. Consequently, Dunn and Mazzulo's measure ments must be considered to be an understatement of the actual situation. The effect of sea-level rise on the vegetation commu nities of Ambergris would have been to inundate or partially inundate savannah areas that now are mangrove swamps. ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA The first archaeological work on the island was by Thomas Gann who excavated at least one Postclassic site (Gann 1926). Much later, Elizabeth Graham and Peter Schmidt, both as archaeo logical commissioners, made informal surveys in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During the same period, Norman Hammond (1976:78) reported that trade wares such as Plumbate and Fine Orange had been found on the island. The provenience of these is not known, as they were in a collection of looted materials from Ambergris (Hammond, personal communication 1988). Other references to the archaeology of Ambergris Caye include Andrews's (1983) work on salt production and trade. Andrews (1983:46) reports that local informants estimated the production of two salinas on northern Ambergris to have yielded 10-100 tons of salt annually. However, these have ceased to function in the past few decades. Cherry Hamman Hollander (1984:128-130) also discussed the possibility that the "black dirt mounds," as sites are often termed on Ambergris and elsewhere, were the result of the Maya bringing dirt for gardens from the mainland by canoe. This concept has been dismissed as excavations were undertaken. Programmatic study of Ambergris was begun when the author and Herman Smith undertook an initial testing opera tion at the site of San Juan in 1985. Then, joined by James Garber as a third codirector, we began intensive excavations at San Juan in 1986 (Guderjan 1988; Guderjan et al. 1989). In 1987, we were joined by David Glassman and excavated at the sites of Ek Luum and Chac Balam, completing the work at Chac Balam in the 1988 season. During the 1987 and 1988 sea sons, we conducted concurrent surveys, which were continued in 1990 and 1991 (Guderjan 1995). Smith has also found addi tional sites as recently as 1993. In addition, Elizabeth Graham and David Pendergast have conducted intensive excavations of the Marco Gonzalez site (Graham 1989; Graham and Pender gast 1989) and in the town of San Pedro. As a result, 22 prehistoric sites are known on Ambergris Caye. While most of these are on the coastal margin, within about 200 m of the water, some are on the higher interior of the island. Equally important is if they are on the windward or lee ward side of Ambergris and whether or not they exhibit formal architecture. "Formal architecture" in this paper is defined as stone masonry or earthen substructural mounds. Table 1 sum marizes the known archaeological sites on Ambergris Caye. While this is, an exercise in squeezing diverse and disparate data into categories, it does aid in understanding patterns. Category 1 represents the leeward-side sites that exhibit for mal architecture. These also have direct access to natural or possibly man-made harbor facilities, and with one exception â Punta LimÃ³n âare the largest Late and Terminal Classic sites on the island. In several cases, these sites exhibit formal plazas (Chac Balam, Burning Water, Laguna de Cayo Francesa, Santa Cruz, and Marco Gonzalez). While these sites are large by island standards, they are small by mainland standards. A reasonable maximum occupancy "guesstimate" for sites such as Chac Balam, Burning Water, and San Juan would be in the neighbor</page><page sequence="4">150 Guderjan Table 1.

These would probably represent large, extended families or similar lineage groupings. Our survey work has been sufficient to conclude that we have a complete sam ple of sites in this category. Category 2 includes the three windward-side sites that have formal architecture. Each requires some further discussion. The sites of Tres Cocos and Ek Luum are actually on narrow strips of land roughly between the windward-side beach and interior lagoons. In the Ek Luum case, access is provided through the lagoon and Bacalar Chico to the leeward side. Tres Cocos is in a similar setting, with access provided by the San Pedro River to the leeward side. In these special cases, their proximity to the beach masks the fact that they fit in many respects in Cat egory 1. Placement in Category 1 would be as reasonable as Category 2 due to their high degree of accessibility from the lee ward side. Robles Point is another anomaly in that its "formal architecture" consists solely of a very low, barely defined exten sion to a natural stone outcrop. Test excavations show that this extension is only about 50 cm tall. Presumably, the outcrop and extension were used as agglutinated platforms (Freidel and Sab loff 1984) or substructural bases for perishable structures. Therefore, Category 2 is best characterized as the anomalies on the windward side. Our survey work was sufficient to conclude that we have a complete or nearly complete sample of sites in this category. Category 3 includes only the special case of the Basil Jones site. Basil Jones is unique in its location in the center of the northern Ambergris terrestrial mass, instead of being located near navigable water. Basil Jones is one of three sites, the oth ers being Santa Cruz and San Pedro Lagoon, which include stone-masonry structures. At least four masonry structures exist at Basil Jones in very poor condition. Basil Jones also includes an extensive network of "field walls" covering at least 4 square kilometers. Elsewhere, these date to the Early Postclassic period (Rathje and Phillips 1975) and the Late Postclassic (A. Andrews, personal communication 1995). A late temporal assessment is supported by Tohil Plumbate vessels recovered by looters from the site and the strong possibility that this is the site dug by Gann (1926). In the Basil Jones case, the function of the field walls has not been determined. However, they probably marked agricultural or residential space. Category 4 includes the two small leeward-side sites of Yalamha and Hancock. Yalamha is an Early Classic residential site submerged by more than 1 m of water. Hancock is actually on an island in an interior lagoon, but is readily accessible from the leeward side. It is likely that we have not located all sites of this category, and our data are insufficient to discuss pattern ing among them. Category 5 is composed of the windward-side sites with no formal architecture. Most of these sites (San Pablo, Mata Grande, Habaneros, Franco, and Valencia) are habitation sites dating to the Late and Terminal Classic periods located adja cent to interior lagoons very near the windward-side beach. The San Pedro site is a Postclassic residential and mortuary site cur rently being excavated by Elizabeth Graham and David Pender gast. Materials from this site are being recovered from buried contexts without any visible surface features from the center of the town of San Pedro. The Guerrero site is a residential mid den on the north side of the town of San Pedro and may be related to the San Pedro site. Los Renegados is a Middle Post classic site unrelated to the other sites in this category except in the sense of its general characteristics. Testing operations at Los Renegados by Herman Smith yielded large quantities of obsid ian (McKillop 1995a) and a very restricted range of ceramics (Valdez and Guderjan 1992). Late Preclassic and Early Classic Periods The first known occupation of Ambergris Caye occurred dur ing the Late Preclassic period (300 b.c.-a.d. 300) and is evi denced from the sites of Chac Balam and Marco Gonzalez. Unfortunately, the evidence for Late Preclassic occupation is quite meager. A single, Protoclassic mammiform sherd was found in the surface collection from Chac Balam, and no con struction or intact occupation has been found. Similarly, Graham and Pendergast (1989) found a few Late Preclassic sherds underlying the major construction at Marco Gonzalez. It was during the Late Preclassic that Cerros flourished as a trade center at the mouth of the New River in Corozal Bay (Garber 1989; Robertson and Freidel 1986). Therefore, it is likely that the Bacalar Chico, if it existed, was used for canoe</page><page sequence="5">Maya settlement and trade 151 traffic and linked Cerros and other riverine and bay communi ties with the northern coast. Early Classic materials have also only been found at three sites: Laguna de Cayo Francesca, Yalamha, and Marco Gon zalez. A third-party collection from Laguna de Cayo Francesca included a few Early Classic sherds. However, no other Early Classic materials were found during subsequent visits to the site despite deep exposures in looters' pits. Yalamha, which trans lates from Mopan Maya as "place under water," appears to have been a small residential site on the leeward side. Rising sea level and, presumably, related wave erosion have deflated the site, and all that remains is a scatter of artifacts under more than a meter of water. Graham (1989:150) reports Early Classic mate rials at Marco Gonzalez. While this is apparently a substantial occupation, it is poorly known, as it is largely buried under con siderable later construction. Consequently, little more is known of the Early Classic than of the Late Preclassic. However, it is clear that permanent occupation of the island occurred by the Early Classic. Late and Terminal Classic Periods During the Late Classic period, significantly more activity occurred on Ambergris. Late Classic components are known from nearly all sites. The primary information comes from exca vations at San Juan, Chac Balam, and Ek Luum. By about a.d. 600, construction of formal architecture was underway at these and several other sites, and the general site plans as they appear in the Terminal Classic period were being developed. The gen eral settlement pattern of the island was intensive occupation of the coastline with little occupation of the interior. By this time, San Juan, Chac Balam, Burning Water, Santa Cruz, Punta LimÃ³n, and Laguna de Cayo Frances had access to the open Caribbean through the Bacalar Chico and its feeder canals. Coastal trade was a major consideration in the develop ment of these communities. Each was located with respect to a natural harbor or an artificial harbor was constructed. Each had formal architecture and severalâChac Balam, Marco Gonzalez, Santa Cruz, Laguna de Cayo Francesa, and Burning Water â had formal plazas. The strongest architectural evidence for trade and interaction with the north during the Late Classic (Tepeu 3) was found at Structure 3 at San Juan (Figure 3). In its Structure 3B-2nd and 3B-lst configurations, this was a two-tiered, round, perishable structure with upright stone slabs on its perimeter built on top of a round substructure (Guderjan 1988, 1995). The lower tier was elevated approximately 2.0 m and was 9.2 m in diameter. The upper tier was 6.2 m in diameter and raised 15 cm above the lower tier. Round buildings are rare in the Maya lowlands during the Classic, but assume importance during the Terminal Classic at Chichen Itza. Other Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic round buildings are found at Seibal (Smith 1982), Becan (Har rison 1979), and Nohmul (Chase and Chase 1982). A number of round structures also exist at Cozumel (Freidel and Sabloff 1984). Some structures at La ExpediciÃ³n on Cozumel apparently are storage facilities (Freidel and Sabloff 1984:33), while others scattered about the island are associated with cenotes and may be apiaries (Wallace 1978; cf. Freidel and Sabloff 1984:33-34). Round structures at Buena Vista on Cozu mel are undated, and their functions are unknown (Freidel and Figure 3. Pian of Structure 3 Â¡n San Juan. Sabloff 1984:33). San Gervasio Structure 34-f is a small stone structure with a three-tiered substructure (Freidel and Sabloff 1984:62; Gregory 1975). The two structures most comparable to Structure 3 at San Juan are Structure 9 at Nohmul (Chase and Chase 1982) and Structure 79 at Seibal (Smith 1982). Nohmul Structure 9 dates to the Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic, as does San Juan Structure 3. The platform is round and about 14.8 m in diam eter. The substructure is about 9 m in diameter. This is larger, but on the same order of magnitude as San Juan Structure 3. A perishable superstructure was built on top of the substructure as was the case with San Juan Structure 3. Unlike Structure 3 at San Juan, Nohmul Structure 9 has a central support. Like Structure 3, a small staircase allowed access to Nohmul Struc ture 9. Structure 79 at Seibal is considerably larger than those at San Juan or Nohmul (Smith 1982). This building is 18 m in diam eter and 3 m high. There are three equal-sized terraces and a stairway allowing access. In front of the stairway is an altar. On top of the round structure is a smaller, slightly elevated rectan gular floor. Seibal Structure 79 dates to the Bayal phase, the Terminal Classic fluorescence, which is marked by Fine Orange and Fine Gray wares. Structure 34-f at San Gervasio on Cozumel is similar in the configuration and scale of its substructural platform. This is a Terminal Classic building on the southern end of a shrine group on an agglutinated platform separated from the other groups at San Gervasio by about 400 m. The platform is rounded on the south end, forming the first tier of the substructure. Pub</page><page sequence="6">152 Guderjan lished accounts do not specifically state the dimensions of the platforms (Freidel and Sabloff 1984; Gregory 1975). However, by using plan views and reconstruction drawings in each source, general estimates can be made. The lowest tier, actually an extension of the main platform, is about 10 m in diameter. The second tier rises about 3 m above the first and is about 7 m in diameter. The third tier rises another 5 m and is about 5 m in diameter. Each tier is centered upon the previous one. Atop the final tier is a small masonry building in ruins. This was origi nally believed to be round (Gregory 1975), but a reevaluation and comparison with Escalona Ramos's (1946) earlier drawing convinced Freidel and Sabloff (1984:62) that it was square with large openings on each side. However, excavations of the build ing in the early 1980s showed that both the platform and upper structure were round (Vargas de la PeÃ±a 1992:72-74). The similarities in design of these buildings combined with the apparent precedent in the Caracol at Chichen Itza have led Chase and Chase (1982) to argue that the round building at Nohmul is direct evidence of Yucatecan influence at that site. In addition, Hammond (1978) reports a probable port facility at Nohmul. Such a port facility furthers the argument that Structure 9 is a result of interaction with the north. Similarly, Sabloff (1973:128) sees Structure 79 at Seibal, combined with other architectural evidence, as indicative of a "foreign take over." Whether it does or not, it certainly exhibits an influx of ideas and influence from elsewhere. The string of Quintana Roo round structures at ports such as Xcaret, Tulum, Paalmul, and Xelha indicates that round structures were incorporated into the accoutrements of the maritime-trade system. Although these sites postdate the round buildings at San Juan, Seibal, Nohmul, and Becan, the associ ation with maritime trade is clear. In all cases, these buildings are in prominent locations within the site. Generally, these are seen as shrines or administrative structures. At San Juan, occu pational debris on Structure 3 indicates that it had a residential as well as administrative function. Structure 3's prominent loca tion with a stairway opening to the center of the site indicates that the administrative aspect existed there as well. In short, the presence of Structure 3 at San Juan strongly supports the concept that the site participated in the maritime trade system. It is the strongest architectural evidence that could have been recovered. The existence of Terminal Classic round structures appears to be a result of non-Maya influence on the Maya world. Further, this is a period of increased interaction among parts of the Maya world as well as with other peoples. Some of this interaction may not have been peaceful, such as seen at Seibal. San Juan Structure 3 predates the round struc tures associated with trade along the Quintana Roo coast, but the analogy remains very strong. This is especially true with the position of Nohmul and its port pointing to riverine trading activities in association with a round structure. This is not to suggest that the presence of Structure 3 represents the presence of members of a northern ethnic group at San Juan. Instead, it seems to be emulation of an exotic architectural type. Another important architectural configuration, the plazuela, or small plaza group, is reflected in the site plans of Chac Balam and Burning Water. Both sites have a centrally located rectan gular plaza that is surrounded on all sides by platforms that vary in height from 2 to 6 m. The dating of this style at Chac Balam is at least as early as the Late Classic period. This architectural pattern was common at mainland sites and prominent on Cozumel in the Terminal Classic period when trade and other interactions with the Chichen Itza polity increased (Freidel and Sabloff 1984). Artifactual data also support the concept that Category 1 sites were well integrated into the maritime-trade system. Exca vations at Chac Balam and San Juan indicate that these sites had a considerably higher level of access to exotic goods than sites on the windward side that lacked formal architecture and har bor facilities. These larger, more affluent sites apparently rep resent the activities of family enterprises in the coastal-trade system. Though the scale of the sites is variable, there is no evi dence to support a proposition of any centralized authority on the island. The political relationships with mainland sites, such as Santa Rita, cannot be adequately assessed. Nearly all ceramics found on Ambergris were imported from elsewhere. The major exception is Coconut Walk Plain and Stri ated (Graham 1994), a common coastal type found from at least southern Belize northward to well up the Quintana Roo coast. While ceramics from the northern Belize sphere dominate the assemblages at San Juan, Chac Balam, and Ek Luum, materi als from a number of other areas are included. The Belize Val ley, southern Belize, Campeche, and Yucatan all contributed wares to these assemblages (Guderjan 1988; Valdez et al. 1995). Exotic ceramics include Daylight Orange, Chunhuitz Orange (Gifford 1976:301-302, 267-269) and Silkgrass Fluted (Graham 1994) and a number of unnamed Trickle Wares. By the Termi nal Classic, this inventory included Fine Orange, Fine Gray, Chichen Red, Sotuta Slate (Smith 1971), and Tohil Plumbate (Shepard 1948). This assemblage would appear to be a function of Ambergris participating in a trade system that incorporated all of these areas. Trade or other interaction with the northern Belize sphere of the mainland is also seen in the Ambergris ceramic assemblages. Very elaborate Peten Gloss wares such as Saxche and Palmar Orange polychromes (Adams 1971) are found in abundance. Tohil Plumbate vessels were found at both San Juan (Guder jan 1988:175-180) and Marco Gonzalez (Graham and Pendergast 1989). The "San Juan jar" (Figure 4) is a gadrooned, tripodal jar with Shepard's (1948:30-31) "button-face" anthropomorphic figure appliqued on the exterior. The identity of "button-face" is unknown, but it possibly represents a local deity in the Pacific coast region of Guatemala and Chiapas (Neff 1989), the place of Plumbate manufacture. Other speculations as to the identity are Ek Chuak, the merchant god (Valdez et al. 1995) or a bat motif. Interestingly, a nearly identical vessel lacking a tripodal base was found at Marco Gonzalez (Graham and Pendergast 1989). A number of us (Garber, Guderjan, Pendergast) have seen both vessels and conclude that the stylistic similarities are so great that they may have been made by the same potter. Both were found in Terminal Classic burials under floors of impor tant buildings. The San Juan jar was found in Burial 2, Struc ture 3 with a tubular jade bead, a carved jade bead, and two chert bifaces. One class of exotic stone that reflects long-distance trade is obsidian. The major sources in the Guatemalan highlands are El Chayal and Ixtepeque. Generally, El Chayal was the domi nant source during the Late Preclassic and Early Classic peri ods, while Ixtepeque increased in prominence during the Late and Terminal Classic, eventually dominating during the Post</page><page sequence="7">Maya settlement and trade 153 Figure 4. Tohil Plumbate jar from San ]uan. classic (Dreiss 1988; Nelson 1985). While there are deviations within some collections indicative of greater complexity (for example see Healy et al. 1984), the general pattern is apparent. Other sources include Pachuca, the major Mexican source of green obsidian, and other sources of gray obsidian in northern and central Mexico. The obsidian recovered from Ambergris sites also reinforces the interpretation of long-distance trade (Guderjan et al. 1989; McKillop 1995a). Green Pachuca obsidian from central Mexico, which would have been transported by boat around the north ern Yucatan Peninsula, was found at San Juan and Laguna de Cayo Francesa, as well as at Marco Gonzalez (Graham and Pen dergast 1989). At San Juan, the percentage of Pachuca obsid ian was surprisingly high at 13.9%. The total percentage of obsidian from sources in central Mexico is even higher at 18.6%. Ucareo obsidian is also found in Terminal Classic con texts at San Juan as was also the case at Wild Cane Cay and Isla Cerritos. Most obsidian at San Juan, though, came from El Chayal in the Guatemalan highlands and was probably shipped down the Motagua River and northward along the coast. The predominance of El Chayal obsidian at San Juan is surprising, as Ixtepeque is more common at such sites as Wild Cane Cay, Nohmul, and Colha during the Terminal Classic. In general, while the obsidian assemblages show some degree of variabil ity, McKillop (1995a) has shown that the obsidian from these sites fit well into existing distance-reduction models for coastal trade. It is significant that no green obsidian was found on north em Ambergris Caye except at San Juan. This includes the nearby site of Chac Balam, where two seasons of excavation were undertaken. This indicates that San Juan functioned dif ferently than other sites on the island. Throughout northern Belize, very low frequencies of green obsidian have been reported, and these are usually from special contexts such as elite burials (Dreiss 1988). The frequency at San Juan is much higher than at any of these other sites, and green obsidian was found in domestic refuse. These data support San Juan's role as a transshipment facility that acted as a funnel for goods com ing into and out of northern Belize. From the site of Marco Gonzalez, gray obsidian, green Pachuca obsidian, jade, chert, and granite artifacts have been reported (Graham and Pender gast 1989), although their frequencies and chronological con texts have not been reported. In addition to obsidian, other exotic stone materials includ ing quartz, marble, volcanic stones such as basalt and andesite, chloromelanite, and a variety of greenstones have been found at sites on Ambergris Caye from Late and Terminal Classic con texts (Garber 1995). Although excavations have been conducted at four sites on the island (Ek Luum, San Juan, Chac Balam, and Marco Gonzalez), surface materials at all sites were exam ined. Lagoonal and leeward sites show a significantly higher proportion of all classes of exotic materials than the windward side sites. This, no doubt, is due to the fact that leeward and inland lagoonal sites are situated to have participated in canoe trade and had a very high degree of access to elite goods. Elab orate shell artifacts were being carved for local use and exchange (Garber 1995). While the ratios of exotic to local material used in the man ufacture of objects at San Juan and Chac Balam reflect the role of long-distance trade and roughly match those of Cozumel (Phillips 1979), regional trade with mainland Belize is reflected in the patterns seen in the chert artifacts. No sources of chert for stone tools exist on Ambergris, and chert artifacts recovered from all sites probably derive from the chert-bearing zone around Colha in northern Belize (Shafer 1982:41; Shafer and Hester 1991). Analysis of the Ambergris material indicates that these artifacts arrived as finished tools from the workshops at Colha and possibly elsewhere. These tools were then reworked as necessary by the Ambergris population, who were, under standably, not very skilled at stone knapping (Hult and Hester 1995). The implication of this pattern is that the islanders were occupational specialists who could acquire finished tools in exchange for other goods. Ritual behavior seen in cases such as Burial 14 at Chac Balam clearly mimics elite behavior of mainland centers. The individ ual interred in Burial 14 was an adult male interred with an Altun Ha-style, fluted, Saxche Orange polychrome vessel (Fig ure 5) that was covered by a sherd lid. By his head was a pair of jade ear spools, and at his pelvis were a conch shell cup and carved bone bloodletting tool. A major structural addition was built in his honor (Driver 1991; Driver et al. 1995). We interpret this as being the burial of the most important male of Chac Balam who practiced ritual autosacrifice, as normally restricted to the elites. This imitation of elite behavior and the elaborate nature of the interment support the idea that sites such as Chac Balam were finding mercantilism to be a viable alternative and a route toward control of resources. Or, as Sabloff and Rathje (1975) noted, the merchant class was rising.</page><page sequence="8">154 Guderjan Figure 5. Saxche polychrome cylinder vase from Chac Balam. Settlement patterning at this time reflects a functional dichot omy among Ambergris sites. The wealthier Category 1 commu nities that were participating in the trade system were on the western or leeward side of the island and, in the case of Burn ing Water, the northern interior lagoons. The calm waters of the leeward side and natural coves provided strategically useful loca tions for such settlement. Where such natural harbors did not exist, such as was apparently the case at Chac Balam, artificial harbors were constructed. Burning Water and, in a sense, Ek Luum, were linked to the other communities and the trade routes by open channels, which were possibly man-made. They were also located so that they could easily be reached by canoes coming from the coast bringing goods to be later loaded onto canoes plying the coast itself. On the windward side of the island, many smaller, Cat egory 2 residential sites were also present. Examples include Guerrero, Franco, and Valencia. Excavations at these sites revealed no buildings with substructures or formal architecture. These communities did not have sustained access to exotic goods, as did their wealthier neighbors. The most common pot tery found is a crude, friable unnamed type with sand temper that appears to have been made on-site. Few or no exotic goods were found; burials included few or no grave goods, and only simple plastered house floors were found. These small sites apparently were simple fishing communities. The reef merges with the island at Rocky Point, cutting off these communities from long-distance trade routes and economic prosperity. Faunal remains from the excavations are sparse. However, a sufficiently large sample was obtained from Ek Luum for Shaw (1995) to determine that broad-based exploitation of mar itime (deep water, reef, and shallow water) and terrestrial ani mal resources occurred. The use of maritime resources explain why skeletal studies show the Ambergris Maya population to equal or exceed the health standards of the mainland, especially during the Terminal Classic, when mainland populations were experiencing health stresses, probably due to degrading diets (Glassman 1995). An important and yet unresolved question is whether imported corn was a major component of these coastal people's diet. Today, corn and other agricultural products are grown on the rich, anthropomorphic soils of archaeological sites. How ever, these soils are the consequence of occupation and sub sequent abandonment and did not exist in the past. With the exception of Basil Jones, island sites were not situated near soils appropriate for growing corn, and the island adaptation is clearly focused on maritime resources. Therefore, if corn was a significant part of island diet, it probably would have been imported from the mainland, indicating that coastal trade in such commodities actually existed. Another question illuminated by the Ambergris data is that of local saltmaking on the Belize coast. MacKinnon and Kepecs (1989) identified an artifact complex composed of crudely made ceramic cylinders, sockets, and spacers that joined ceramic vessels during the process of evaporating salt from sea water (sal cocida). This complex was found at a number of small, specialized-use Terminal Classic sites on Placencia Point in southern Belize. Valdez and Mock (1991) report that a similar complex is found in Terminal Classic levels at the Northern River Lagoon site. While the original papers do not identify the ceramic type asso ciated with the saltmaking complex, Valdez has more recently identified it as Coconut Walk (Valdez et al. 1995). Coconut Walk ceramics are found at numerous Ambergris sites, including large deposits at San Juan, Chac Balam, and Ek Luum. However, the cylinders, sockets, and spacers are extremely rare or nonexistent. In addition, the location of Chac Balam nearly adjacent to a well-known salina is important in this regard. The salina was identified by Andrews (1983:46), who interviewed people in the town of San Pedro on Amber gris Caye. They reported that salt was harvested from this salina as recently as a few decades ago. One report, confirmed by the author with the informants, was that nearly a ton was harvested in one visit. Andrews estimates the potential production of the two northern Ambergris salinas to be in the range of 10-50 tons annually. On one hand, it is difficult to understand why small scale evaporative techiques (sal cocida) would be used at sites adjacent and nearly adjacent to lagoons that produced salt (sal solar) that could be shoveled out when the lagoons annually dried. On the other hand, it is equally difficult to explain the 4-m-high mound composed almost entirely of burnt Coconut Walk ceramics at Ek Luum, adjacent to the lagoon (Driver et al. 1995). Consequently, Andrews (1983) is certainly correct that salt production on Ambergris Caye was of large enough scale to be a significant component of the economy. However, the association of Coconut Walk ceramics, at least without the asso ciated lugs, remains problematical. In the Terminal Classic period, most sites show a continua tion of early patterns. Major construction at these sites, how ever, was replaced by repeated refurbishings on a much smaller scale. For example, the floor of Structure 3 at San Juan was replastered at least three times, but no significant remodeling or construction occurred. Trade goods were still abundant, and evidence for continued interaction with the north as well as mainland northern Belize is present. A mortuary pattern of repeated, very shallow burials reflects the low-level of energy invested in all such activities, though the health of the popula</page><page sequence="9">Maya settlement and trade 1 55 tions remained stable (Glassman 1995). During this period, Ambergris continued to participate in the maritime trade sys tem. However, we do not know what stresses were exerted upon the system to cause a reduction in construction efforts. The end of the Classic brought major changes on Ambergris. Nearly all sites on the coast were abandoned, and trade activi ties may have ceased. The last major activity at San Juan was the construction of small buildings on the flanks of the site. The most recent radiocarbon date of ca. a.d. 1000 comes from this context and nearly marks the abandonment of the site. While some activity continues at Chac Balam after this date, it is prob able that the site was no longer fully occupied and may have been used primarily for mortuary purposes. The major excep tion to this pattern is Marco Gonzalez, which thrived and grew during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic periods (Graham 1989). Postclassic Period The data from the Postclassic period reflect a major restructuring of both settlement on Ambergris Caye and the economic sys tem of the Maya. The small, coastal-margin sites were aban doned, and activity was concentrated at Marco Gonzalez and perhaps Basil Jones. This was clearly a shift of focus, and there may also have been movement of people from other sites to Marco Gonzalez. At Marco Gonzalez, Graham and Pendergast (1989; also Graham 1989) found continuous occupation from the Late Classic into the Postclassic. Importantly, major construction continued into the Postclassic at Marco Gonzalez. It is very pos sible that the close ceramic affinities between Marco Gonzalez and Lamanai are related to the community's apparent indepen dence from the factors that influenced the abandonment of the coastal margin of the northern part of the island. Basil Jones, on the interior of the island, and the San Pedro Lagoon site are believed to date to the Postclassic. These assess ments are based on the presence of the very crude stone build ings and, in the case of Basil Jones, the field walls. Also, the elaborate Postclassic burial excavated by Thomas Gann on Ambergris, at "the largest mound," was probably at Basil Jones. I initially believed this to be San Juan; it now seems probable that Gann dug in one of the now nearly demolished mounds of Basil Jones. Alternatively, Anthony Andrews (personal commu nication 1995) has suggested that it was at the San Pedro Lagoon site. Interestingly, an early Spanish map shows a set tlement in this general area of Ambergris that may well be Basil Jones (Grant Jones, personal communication 1991), so occupa tional continuity may have occurred. The growth of Basil Jones, then, reflects an adaptation with a more terrestrial focus. Even so, trade may have continued to be an important activity, and Basil Jones could have functioned similarly to San Gervasio and Buena Vista on Cozumel (Sab loff and Rathje 1975). Nevertheless, a complete structural shift had occurred. The northern Ambergris coastal margin was abandoned, and population apparently grew in the interior, adopting attributes such as walled compounds, which are seen elsewhere at the same time. In the southern part of the island, Marco Gonzalez seemingly retained its maritime and trade focus while growing in size and complexity. However, other coastal margin sites in the south end of the island were abandoned. The only Middle Postclassic site found so far on Ambergris Caye is Los Renegados. The very large quantities of Ixtepeque obsidian recovered from the site indicate that coastal trade was again flourishing (McKillop 1995a). However, the impact on the island was much different than previously. Los Renegados in cludes no formal architecture, only dense residential debris and the floors of perishable buildings. We cannot know if, at this time, Basil Jones or other sites were occupied. However, Graham and Pendergast (1989) have found evidence of residen tial and mortuary activity at the San Pedro site dating from this period. IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING MAYA COASTAL TRADE AND POLITICAL ECONOMIES The study of premodern market economies largely derives from the work of Polanyi et al. (1957) and their colleagues. One of them, Anne Chapman (1957), investigated the function and role of trade in pre-Columbian Maya society. Nevertheless, the first broad picture of Maya trade emerged from the work of Eric Thompson (1970). From these and other works, interest arose in the role of trade in the rise and fall of the Maya civilization. In particular, the Cozumel Archaeological Project was designed to study the island as a port of trade with important results in terms of the politics and mechanics of trade, as well as the decline of the Classic Maya (Freidel and Sabloff 1984; Sabloff 1977; Sabloff and Rathje, eds. 1975). More recent work has focused on the trade of items such as salt (Andrews 1983), obsidian (Dreiss 1988; Hammond 1976), and site-specific stud ies (i.e., Andrews et al. 1988; Garber 1989; Guderjan 1988; McKillop 1981, 1987). The general themes of what is known of Maya trade during the Classic and Postclassic periods can be briefly summarized. Sabloff argued that Classic-period trade dealt primarily with nonessential elite goods rather than utilitarian goods. Only in the Postclassic period does trade, at least maritime trade, hit its full pace with the establishment of ports of trade such as Cozumel (Sabloff 1977). This generally supports Thompson's (1970) idea that the Putun Maya of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico took control of trade routes during the eighth and ninth centuries a.d. but does not agree with Andrews's (1983) infor mation regarding the large requirements of salt in the southern lowlands that were being supplied from the north during the Classic period. According to Sabloff, jade, basalt, obsidian, etc. were the primary materials being traded during the Classic. However, by the Early Postclassic, Cozumel had been estab lished as a Chichen Itza/Putun sphere port of trade that avoided the coastal portion of the Coba sphere. Similarly, Terminal Classic architectural affinities with the northern Yucatan are seen in northern Belize at Lamanai (Pendergast 1986) and Noh mul (Chase and Chase 1982). Walled coastal cities such as Tulum and Ichpaat'un, with their columned structures, also partici pated in this system. During this period, specialized pottery manufacturing techniques, designed to facilitate ease of transport, increased commodities trade, and there was a shift in the sources of obsidian (Dreiss 1988; Hammond 1976; Sabloff 1977). Cen tral Mexican influence was more strongly felt as indicated by an increase in green obsidian, and the central Mexican-style murals at Postclassic Santa Rita show evidence of contact with central Mexico (Chase 1982).</page><page sequence="10">156 Guderjan The impression should not be left that large-scale maritime trade was only a Classic and Postclassic phenomenon. Late Pre classic Cerros may well have been a interregional port (Garber 1989; Robertson and Freidel 1986). Trade may also have been one of the important mechanisms of the rise of Maya civiliza tion itself (Freidel 1979; Rathje 1971). By the Classic period, however, maritime trade surely served to provide goods that reinforced the authority of the elites and commodities such as salt. It should also be noted that things that were once only goods for the elite had become commodities by the end of the Classic period. By then, obsidian, for example, is found repeat edly at the household level throughout the southern lowlands. During the Postclassic, maritime trade had become a vital force in Maya economics, which may have come about in conjunc tion with the emergence of a merchant class (Sabloff and Rathje, eds. 1975). The role of outside groups in the development of Maya mar itime trade has been the subject of controversy and debate since Thompson (1966) introduced the notion that the Putun Maya (sixteenth-century Chontal Maya) of the Gulf coast took con trol of, and developed, existing trade routes during the eighth and ninth centuries a.d. Fine Orange and Fine Gray wares are believed by some (Thompson 1971) to be Putun Maya markers, although the validity of this has been challenged (Adams 1971; Andrews and Robles Castellanos 1985:62-64; Sabloff et al. 1982). Whether or not the Putun model is valid, this is a period of increased interaction within the lowlands as well as with external "Mexicanized" groups. Some of this interaction may not have been peaceful and probably contained violent compo nents as was the case at Seibal. As Andrews and Robles Castellanos (1985) point out, the Putun models are superficial and simplistic and do not address the questions of sociopolitical interaction at the local level. Fur thermore, critics have argued that the Putun may not have been a single group, but rather were a group of related and perhaps competing Gulf coast peoples (Miller 1977). Indeed, it may be erroneous to view the situation as a single event such as an inva sion or take over by the Putun (or Gulf coast peoples), but rather as a continuous process marked by increasing influence. A more gradual development is precisely what Andrews (1983) concludes for Gulf coast influence on the north and west coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic periods. On Ambergris Caye, Sotuta ceramics, round structures, and a variety of exotic imports, including high proportions of central Mexican obsidian, recovered on Amber gris Caye, are suggestive of strong relationships with the Maya of northern Yucatan sites such as Chichen Itza. The Ambergris sites that were situated to participate in the maritime trade system âChac Balam, San Juan, Burning Water, Santa Cruz, Laguna de Cayo Frances, and Marco Gonzalez â share a number of attributes. Each is located on the calm lee ward side of the island or on lagoons connected to the leeward side. Each is, therefore, protected from the windward side and could participate in the trade system without the dangers of canoe travel beyond the reef. These sites also have port facili ties. Santa Cruz, Laguna de Cayo Frances, and Marco Gonza lez are all situated adjacent to protected lagoons. Furthermore, the plaza at Laguna de Cayo Frances fronts onto a probable artificial canal. Several small protected inlets are on the west side of Punta San Juan, and docking facilities would have been easy to build at any location. Burning Water and Ek Luum are also adjacent to Laguna de Cantena, which is connected to the Baca lar Chico channel by a long secondary canal. Chac Balam is located directly adjacent to an artificial port facility. The calm waters of the leeward side make safe harboring possible at almost any point. Leeward-side sites are simply situated at espe cially good locations. The artifactual evidence for trade consists of the presence of large quantities of exotic nonperishable goods, particularly stone and ceramic artifacts. Exotic stone and pottery of the Maya world reflect not only the existence of trade but also reveal much of the nature of the trade network itself. The evidence from Ambergris Caye forces some rethinking of the maritime trade systems of the Maya. While information about the Late Preclassic is limited, that dearth of information does actually shed some light on the structure of the trade sys tem at that time. For example, Cerros was a regionally impor tant trade port in the Late Preclassic period (Freidel 1979). However, the trade network apparently did not incorporate the use of Hammond's (1976) "transshipment points" on Amber gris or, perhaps, anywhere else. The Ambergris data also shed new light on Sabloff's (1977) concept of coastal trade being relatively small in scale during the Late Classic, dealing only with elite goods. Again, it must be mentioned that goods traditionally reserved for the elite had become commonplace to the degree of being commodities by the end of the Classic period. Obsidian seems to have become a commodity, and salt was certainly being traded in considerable quantity (Andrews 1983). Harrison (1990) has argued that the intensive fields of Pulltrouser Swamp provided food for the nearby city of Nohmul, and it is likely that food from Pulltrou ser Swamp also entered the maritime-trade system. Further, the Ambergris data clearly show that structured systems to accom modate trade date to the earliest part of the Late Classic if not earlier. If such a group as the Putun existed, Thompson (1970) appears to have been correct in stating that they seized control of existing trade routes and were not the creators of these routes. The trade routes were apparently created by a growing group of competing family units during the Classic period and consol idated in the Early Postclassic. This concept also fits with the Postclassic data from Ambergris. At the very time that trade routes were being consolidated, the coastal margin of Amber gris was being virtually abandoned. This only makes sense if the functions of the walled cities of Tulum on the Quintana Roo coast and Ichpaat'un on Chetumal Bay, for example, are taken into account. First, these walled cities are much farther apart than the previous nodes in the trade network. Only a few miles separated Chac Balam, San Juan, Santa Cruz, and Laguna de Cayo Francesa, while modern replicative studies show that a Maya trade canoe could have easily traveled 40 km per day (Michel Peissel, personal communication 1989). In other words, a canoe with a preset destination could easily have passed up each and every site on Ambergris. It is not coincidental that MacKinnon (1990) found the earliest utilization of the far offshore islands of southern Belize to have occurred at this time. This may simply be a strategy of avoiding hostile raiders near the coast. Also, the walled cities of Tulum and Ichpaat'un are as well if not better suited for defense by terrestrial forces as opposed to maritime forces. By defending trade ports and spac ing them relatively far apart, the Postclassic traders were sim</page><page sequence="11">Maya settlement and trade 157 ply reducing the energy input required to maintain control over the system. By controlling the system, they also forced the cre ators of the system, those family entrepreneurs of Ambergris and elsewhere, out of the system. CONCLUSIONS The archaeological record on Ambergris Caye reflects a trajec tory of growth throughout the Classic period, perhaps as early as the Late Preclassic, which was inextricably intertwined with the growth of coastal-trade systems among the Maya. By the end of the Classic period, this fully developed system included a network of small sites, perhaps family-run enterprises, orga nized around single-unit plazuela complexes. These were inter related nodes in the coastal-trade system. In addition to servicing coastal trade, these may have been points where Ambergris prod ucts such as salt, shell, and salted fish entered the trade network, bound for mainland sites. Importantly, not all communities par ticipated in this system. Some, especially windward-side commu nities, did not have the degree of access to exotic goods afforded to the trade-related communities. In the Early Postclassic this trajectory dramatically changed. With the exception of Marco Gonzalez, coastal-margin sites were abandoned. A restructuring clearing occurred that included a shift in adaptation to the resources of the island's interior, especially at Basil Jones. This shift marks the transformation of the trade system from one of cooperating and possibly inde pendent small units to large, more distantly placed units, which were well prepared for defense against land attacks. The shift to the use of remote, offshore islands in southern Belize may also reflect a concern with protection of trade routes from raiders. This shift is tremendously important because it provides a window into the nature of the restructuring of Maya society at the end of the Classic period. In concert with the political and economic changes occurring in both the southern and northern lowlands, the coastal-trade system that had gradually developed over at least half of a millennium was rapidly reorganized to reflect the new realities of the Maya world. RESUMEN Investigaciones arqueolÃ³gicas se condujeron por tres aÃ±os en Cayo Ambergris, Belice, empezando en 1986. Durante la prospecciÃ³n se iden tificaron 19 sitios arqueolÃ³gicos. Se realizaron excavaciones intensivas en tres sitios y excavaciones limitadas en algunos mÃ¡s. AdemÃ¡s, un cuarto sitio fue excavado por otro proyeto. Esta base de datos nos proporciona la oportunidad de examinar la variabilidad temporal y fun cional del registro arqueolÃ³gico. La primera ocupaciÃ³n de Ambergris data del periodo preclÃ¡sico tardÃ­o y en el clÃ¡sico temprano se empezÃ³ a formar un patrÃ³n que con tinuÃ³ creciendo hasta el clÃ¡sico terminal. Los asentamientos localizados en el Ã¡rea protegida de la isla participaron en una prospera red de inter cambio. Al mismo tiempo, los asentamientos en el Ã¡rea no protegida de la costa del Caribe no tuvieron el mismo acceso a bienes exÃ³ticos y no construyeron arquitectura formal. Los sitios relacionados con el intercambio estÃ¡n localizados relativamente cerca del uno al otro, mÃ¡s o menos 5 km, y no exhiben evidencia de conflicto. Los datos de Amber gris demuestran que el sistema de intercambio que existiÃ³ durante el perÃ­ odo clÃ¡sico tardÃ­o fue mucho mÃ¡s intenso que lo anticipado. Al final del perÃ­odo clÃ¡sico se produjo un cambio fundamental en la vida de Cayo Ambergris. Los asentamientos costeros que participa ron en la red de intercambio fueron abandonados. Aunque ciertas actividades parecen haber sido consolidadas en el sitio de Marco Gon zÃ¡lez, un nuevo patron de asentamiento tambiÃ©n emergiÃ³. Para el perÃ­ odo postclÃ¡sico temprano, una adaptaciÃ³n basada en recursos terrestres en lugar de marÃ­timos se desarrollÃ³ en el interior norteÃ±o de Cayo Ambergris. Este cambio coincide con aquel ocurrida en la situaciÃ³n econÃ³mica y polÃ­tica maya en las tierras bajas del sur y nos da una nueva perspectiva para observar la organizaciÃ³n institucional de los mayas.
