CHAMPIONS OF THE GREAT TRADITION BY HAYWARD KENISTON, President of the Association IT is a humbling experience to realize, as I speak to you this evening, that I have said many times before the things that are on my mind to say. It is even more humbling to know that all that I can say has been better said by other men before me. But I make no apology for reaffirm- ing my faith that the study of man is the heart of a liberal education, that the understanding of man's spiritual power is our last, best hope in a world distraught. And so tonight I shall try to define what I believe to be the proper scope of that study. It is hardly necessary to say that by the "Great Tradition" I mean that stream of human achievement which we know as Western civiliza- tion. It has had many tributaries, but the two major confluents have been the Greco-Roman heritage and the Judeao-Christian heritage. At the risk of being arbitrary in so complex a matter, let me try to identify a few of the basic concepts that have flowed from each of these sources. As we think of the lasting contributions which Greece, and particu- larly Athens, made to the life of man, three things stand out: the capacity of human reason to determine norms for human behavior; the develop- ment of a system of government in which free men ordered their common welfare; the cult of beauty as a creative representation of man's search for form, for proportion, for harmony. Although this is not the place to examine each of these contributions in detail, let me comment on one or two salient aspects. If we consider only the great flowering of Greek thought from Socrates to Aristotle, its most striking trait is the swift development of a rational methodology for the examination of human problems, whether in the field of ethics and politics or at the more abstract level of logic and meta- physics. With Aristotle this same methodology is applied, for the first time, to the natural world and lays a foundation for science. The concept 3</page><page sequence="2">Champions of the Great Tradition of the individual's rational capacity lies too at the very heart of that first experiment in self-government which we still call "democracy." And surely the great works of Greek art, in epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry, in sculpture and in architecture, are only another manifestation of the Greeks' cult of the creative genius of the human spirit. Transplanted to Rome, these Greek ideals continued to bear fruit, less vigorously, less vitally than in their first flowering, but none the less per- sistently. And out of them there grew, as befitted an imperial state, another concept of rational construction: the idea of law, as a framework to determine the relation between the individual and society for the pro- tection of both. These four concepts-the power of reason, the capacity of the indi- vidual for self-government, the theory of universal law, the cult of beauty -seem to me the enduring contribution which Greece and Rome made to Western civilization and hence to us today. While essentially rational in content, they did not overlook the aesthetic aspect of human crea- tivity. But let me remind you that their content is essentially worldly; their major affirmation is man's self-sufficiency. The contributions which come from the other great source of our civili- zation are of a very different sort. For the Jewish-Christian tradition is chiefly concerned, not with man as an end in himself nor with the rela- tions of man to man, but with the relations of man to God. The God of the Old Testament is, in a sense, the private God of the Jews, their judge, their fortress, their defender. Less anthropomorphic than the Gods of Olympus, the God of Israel in his high heaven is still, in essence, a re- flection of the aspirations of the people of Israel. The themes which stand out most strikingly, in the Psalms of David for example, are those of humility and reverence, of gratitude and praise and worship. On this foundation Christ built a new religion, a new concept of God. God is a spirit and "the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffer- ing, gentleness, goodness, faith." Within the span of faith and love lie all the guides that man needs for the good life: "whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report." Revelation, not reason, is the source of wisdom. And man-man everywhere, not the Jew alone-because he is the son of God and partaker in the divine pur- pose, takes on a new dignity, a new sense of spiritual power. Thus, to the Classic virtues of prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice are added the new virtues of faith, hope, and love. The meeting of these two major currents is strikingly revealed in the thought of St. Jerome and St. Augustine and in their conscious effort to embrace in a single structure the intellectual and spiritual materials of 4</page><page sequence="3">Hayward Keniston both traditions. If their high purpose failed of permanent fruition, it was in large measure due to the collapse of Classic civilization. Yet we must not forget that the Orthodox Church of the East and the Catholic Church of the West were built on the ruins of Byzantium and of Rome. And it was the Church that during the Dark Ages served as a carrier, not only for Christian teaching but also for some remnants of Classic learning. The great movement which we call the Renaissance, initiated by Pe- trarch and reaching its full flower in Italy in the fifteenth century and in the rest of Europe during the first half of the sixteenth century, once more brought to the fore the two aspects of our tradition. The adaptation of Aristotelian rationalism to Christian dogma achieved by St. Thomas Aquinas and the other scholastics of the thirteenth century had quickly degenerated into a jejune dialectic of schoolmen. Hence it was, as I re- marked in passing a year ago, that the rediscovery of Classic thought and Classic art gave to the men of the fifteenth century a new zest for the study of man, a new set of models for thought and behavior. It was inevitable, perhaps, that what seemed like a basic difference between the two traditions should have resulted in two contrasting, even conflicting tendencies. On the one hand there developed, especially in Italy, a cult of the Classic past that is often referred to as "Pagan Hu- manism." Stressing the "worldly" aspect of man's nature, it is marked by an outburst of creative energy, seen at its best in Leonardo da Vinci, or by a passionate cult of beauty, typified, shall we say, in Benvenuto Cellini. In the arts the cult of form at the expense of content was soon to lead to the Baroque. In the field of ideas, the devotion to reason ap- pears in various manifestations, now in the Neo-Platonic musings of the Florentine Academy, now in the scientific and amoral analysis of political behavior presented in Machiavelli's II principe, now in the benevolent skepticism of Montaigne. Even though we should be wrong in ascribing an anti-religious bent to these manifestations of the Classic revival, it is clear that the role of man's religious life is insignificant. In the North, on the other hand, the wave of the Reformation turned more and more to an emphasis on the spiritual needs of man. Luther, at first sympathetic toward the humanistic ideal of human freedom, later came to regard the movement as dangerous to man's salvation be- cause of its independence of divine sanction. Thus the European world was split into ideological camps that even today have not solved their conflict in devotion to a common cause. Even in the sixteenth century there were a few brave figures who sought a healing compromise. I shall mention only two, two men of very different complexion, whose work bridges the gap: Erasmus of Rotterdam 5</page><page sequence="4">Champions of the Great Tradition and Fray Luis de Le6n. Both may rightly be called "Christian human- ists." The figure of Erasmus towers over the intellectual life of the early sixteenth century. Rarely has a man touched so widely and so intimately the lives of his contemporaries or exercised so potent an influence on all the issues of his day. The center of all his scholarly activity-and he is essentially the scholar-was his work on the New Testament. This was for him the true way to rediscover the "Philosophia Christi," the doctrine of love embodied in Christ. And from this central faith in Christ's teach- ing flowed all his other works: his criticism of ecclestiastical abuses, his moral precepts, his theories of education, his tolerance, his pacificism, his internationalism. No man of his day or since was more widely read in the Classics and the Church Fathers; no one has more appealingly argued for the compatibility of reason and faith. The spirit of St. Jerome and St. Augustine comes back to the Western world in his life and work. The other Christian humanist of whom I would speak is Fray Luis de Le6n. In a sense he has little in common with Erasmus, though like him he had a scholar's concern with the purification of the Scriptural texts and even translated the Song of Songs from the Hebrew into Castilian. For Fray Luis was artist, poet, mystic; and his synthesis of Jewish, Christian, and Classic elements finds its most complete expression in a few great poems. Here we can sense the reverence of Israel for God and the wonders of his creation, the craving for the intellectual understanding of the physical world, the Horatian mastery of form and the inner peace of the Beatus ille, and finally the flight of the spirit toward union with eternal love. There is no preaching, no argumentation. "Clad in beauty and unwonted light," man stands revealed in his full stature, human and divine. The fusion of the streams of Western thought is complete. I have ventured to summarize what seem to me to be the main char- acteristics of our Western tradition, because I wanted to establish a back- ground for our study of man today, to redefine the nature of our age-old conflicts and to suggest the possibility of their reconciliation. But before I turn to that problem, I must look for a moment at modern humanism. No one, I am sure, would question that for more than a century now scholarship in the humanities has been dominantly rationalistic. After all, that is not surprising. The astonishing progress of science in the physical and biological world has bewitched us into the belief that the analysis of concrete data, characteristic of the scientific method, can be applied with equal profit to the study of other problems-to economics, to govern- ment, to philosophy; in the end, to the arts, literature, and religion. Its fruits can be found in the statistics of education and sociology, in the structural analyses of the "linguistician," in the logical positivism of modern philosophy. 6</page><page sequence="5">Hayward Keniston In his delightful book, The Classical Tradition, Gilbert Highet has made a penetrating study of Classical scholarship in the nineteenth century, pointing out its extensive contribution to our knowledge of the ancient past and at the same time stressing its ultimate intellectual bank- ruptcy. Almost everything he says applies with equal force to scholarship in the modern languages and literatures. For here, too, rigorous methods of research have enormously enlarged our knowledge of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the modern world. But just as in the Classics, there has been the same tendency toward narrow specialization, toward the accumulation of facts of trivial interest, toward the neglect of the aesthetic and moral content of literature and history. Not the least of the baleful effects of this scientific approach to litera- ture, according to Mr. Highet, was its influence on teaching. The Classics were regarded, not as works to be studied for the interpretation and evalu- ation of their artistic and spiritual content, but, as one schoolmaster said of a tragedy of Sophocles, as "a veritable treasure-house of gram- matical peculiarities." This indifference to the peculiar content of litera- ture tended also to widen the gap between literature and life, to deprive literary studies of relevance to the experience of those who came to learn. Let Mr. Highet summarize his position: "It is, then, the fundamental fault of modern classical scholarship"-and he might have said "of modern literary scholarship"-"that it has cultivated research more than interpretation, that it has been more interested in the acquisition than in the dissemination of knowledge, that it has denied or disdained the relevance of its work in the contemporary world, and that it has encouraged the public neglect of which it now complains." Nowhere have these weaknesses been more strikingly exemplified than in our present doctoral programs, with their tight departmental special- ization, their insistence on the quantitative accumulation of facts, their presumptuous requirement that a thesis must embody a "significant contribution to knowledge." I still recall my doctoral examination, one spring afternoon in the study of George Lyman Kittredge on Hilliard Street. For three hours my elders grilled me in the effort to discover how many facts I had acquired. I was, I thought, well prepared; in my man- uals I had underscored the authors' names in red, the titles in blue. Once, one of my inquisitors asked me what a book was about. That seemed to me unfair, because, naturally, I had not read the book. But I risked a shot in the dark and so far missed the target that my reply was greeted with a general burst of laughter. I did not forget that moment of humilia- tion; I have never laughed at a doctoral candidate, no matter how inane his answers. Now the appalling thing about that examination was not my discomfi- ture but the fact that not one question was asked that would test my 7</page><page sequence="6">Champions of the Great Tradition understanding of the great books which I had read or my capacity to identify and interpret the ideas and ideals of which literature is compact. My degree was given in the field of "philology," not in "literature." If I had my way, I would realistically redefine the goals of graduate training in literature. Since we know that all the young men and women who come to us for guidance are going to be teachers of literature as well as literary scholars, I would base my program on two main activities: training in the materials and methods of literary scholarship and train- ing in the criticism and interpretation of literature. But, you will say, that is what we are doing now. Yes, at the best we are doing that. But the best is, as always, the exception. And almost universally we are still clinging to the notion that the candidate must have acquired the facts of a whole history of literature; we are still accepting theses in which the quantity of collected data obscures the paucity of ideas, the barrenness of imagination, the lack of discriminating taste. And it is in these fields, of ideas, of imagination and taste, that the literary scholar must be strong if he is to quicken a new generation. Years ago I heard a distinguished scientist, Dr. Birge of Wisconsin, say that the decline of the humanities in public interest and prestige was the result of their loss of contact with man and that the first task of the humanist, if he was to deserve that name, was to rediscover the rele- vance of his studies to the life of the common man. That is as true today as it was forty years ago. But today it is no longer a question of saving the humanities; the crisis we face today is that of saving our civilization. For science, with its brave hope of solving all of our problems, of usher- ing in an endless age of progress, has proved to be a false prophet. In the physical and material world it has accomplished miracles. But by its very nature, science has nothing to say of moral and spiritual needs. And"it is precisely here that the crisis of our time rests. Can men and nations find a set of principles which will guide us to mutual understand- ing and peace? Since 1914 we have all witnessed the growing disillusionment and pessi- mism of intellectuals in our country and even more in Europe. Man has lost faith in man. And in his despair he has tried to construct new symbols of faith-a Freudian "sub-conscious," a Marxist "state," an existential- ist "self." Confronted with the failure of scientific rationalism he has taken refuge in a defiant irrationalism. Even within the humanities there have been signs of discontent with the older practices. Some have sought to find justification by a new stress on the social values of religion or letters. This in turn has led to the reaction of the "new critics" with their almost esoteric concern for purely 8</page><page sequence="7">Hayward Keniston literary values. A few, like T. S. Eliot or the Neo-Thomists, would return to an authoritarian orthodoxy. In this welter of confusion and despair, I believe that America has a unique opportunity for leadership. To our contribution to the physical and material welfare of the world, we must add a new message of hope and faith. I am sure that the rest of the world looks to us for that leadership. In a moving address delivered a year ago, the distinguished Lebanese scholar and statesman, Charles Malik, sounded this call to the intellec- tuals of America. Let me quote a single passage: "What matters in the end is that which abides . . .And this is none other than the eternal spirit of truth and love, reaching for man, claiming and forgiving him, sealing him with the seal of its adoption. For I tell you that man will die, unless, remembering his origin, awakening to his plight, he is constantly replenished, amidst tears of joy, by celestial food. It is possible for Ameri- ca to mediate the word of truth; it is possible for you to give this food to yourselves and your children, and to an incredibly hungry world. For the eternal is live and resplendent, though perhaps somewhat hidden in your midst; and the roots of your tradition already draw their sustenance from the gathering of the ages." This is the call which American humanists must answer; it is in this "gathering of the ages" that we must seek for light; it is in the restoration of the study of man to all the aspects of his genius that we may hope to find the "word" that will rekindle man's faith. It means, above all, that we must give increasing emphasis to man's creative urge toward beauty and to his search for those spiritual values which are the surest founda- tion for the "good life." In a word, we must strive to unite once more, in a single stream, the currents of the Great Tradition. Through the centuries we have tended to exaggerate the "warfare of science and religion," the conflict of reason and faith. But it is arbitrary to establish so simple a dichotomy in the human mind. We grow intellec- tually in many ways. By memory we accumulate the knowledge of facts; by reason we organize the relationship of facts and abstractions; by im- agination we recreate the experience of beauty; by intuition, or, if you prefer, by revelation, we acquire the wisdom which orders our total ex- perience in a pattern for decision. When the modern psychologist speaks of an "integrated personality" he is, in effect, merely using his profes- sional terminology to describe the ideal balance of all man's psychic factors. Reason, then, is not the only attribute of man that distinguishes him from the beast; beauty, faith, and love are also his unique, inalien- able gifts. If we, as humanists, are to make our proper contribution to the life 9</page><page sequence="8">Champions of the Great Tradition of our time, even to the survival of our civilization, we are going to have to broaden our concept of our function, both as teachers and as citizens. We must rid ourselves of the incubus of objectivity, the fear of expressing emotion, and embrace within our vision every aspect of man's creative genius. We must, more and more, concern ourselves, not with the facts of history or literature, but with the values which are the unique subject matter of our disciplines. For what are the paintings we see, the symphonies we hear, the novels, plays, and poems we read, if not a record of man's endless urge to find meaning in his life, of his struggle to identify the values that lift man from the dust? The supreme task of the humanist is to re-live, re-interpret these values in their relevance to the problems of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. All that I have said of the humanities in general applies with particular force to the field of literature which is the special province of the members of this Association. Our opportunity is measureless. How shall we live up to it? If we are to meet the challenge of our time, we must begin with a searching re-examination of the validity of what we have been doing as scholars and as teachers. We have at last awakened to the necessity of a study of the role of foreign language study in the life of our day-our "FL Program." But there is even greater need for a "Literature Pro- gram." And for this we shall need no subsidy from a foundation. If it does not function in the professional life of each one of us, it will be meaningless. I shall not presume to give the answers at which such a study would arrive. But of some things I am sure. First of all we must pay more at- tention to the creative aspects of our field. We must welcome into our guild the men and women who are making literature. We must ourselves more generally share in the creation of literary work. And we must ex- pect that the graduate student, who is presently to be called upon to interpret literature, will give evidence of his capacity to write literature. One of my colleagues, Clarence Gohdes, has proposed, as requirements for the doctor's degree in English, that each candidate present an accept- able critical essay on some modern writer for whom there is no available scholarly bibliography, and also an acceptable poem or, if you prefer, composition in verse. I submit that such a requirement might well raise the level of our graduate student body. In the second place, I believe that we must be more catholic in the choice of materials which are essential to our field. Surely we would not lessen our concern with belles-lettres. But often a study of historical or political or philosophical writings will be more helpful to a wise interpre- 10</page><page sequence="9">Hayward Keniston tation of literary texts than extended readings within the limited field of letters. Is not the De monarquia integral in the work of Dante? Could we exclude the writings of Jefferson and Lincoln in any effort to assay the values of American life? Finally, if we are to touch the lives of our students and the men of our time, we shall have to seek unremittingly in the works we study for the values of enduring significance for the life of man and then try to formulate them in terms that will have meaning to others. Have you never noticed the blank look on undergraduate faces, as you expounded to them some literary nicety? It will not do to damn the secondary schools for their failure to enlighten the young savages. The task of enlighten- ment is our task; it is we who must discover the tie of relevance which will permit the student to relive, in his own experience, the beauty and truth of the great lessons of the past. These lessons, I repeat, embrace not only the power of man's mind to solve his problems by the exercise of reason, but also the sustaining force of love and faith as an inspiration for human behavior. When I chose the title I gave to this talk, I meant to stress that we, as students and interpreters of the "Great Tradition," cannot play the negative or passive r61le of "defenders" or "guardians." We must be affirmative, militant "champions" of the cause of man, in that mingling of flesh and spirit that is embodied in Don Quixote. Like that doughty knight, we cannot be content merely to discourse of arms and letters, or of the Golden Age; we must enter the lists in support of the cause in which we believe. We must recognize the attacks upon man's freedom and dig- nity, from whatever source; we must reject the dogmas that preach man's impotence and failure, to reaffirm the hope of his salvation. It is to that high calling that I summon you. When your Secretary asked me whether I was going to talk about lan- guage or literature this evening, I said that I was not sure, probably of neither one. I see now that I have been preaching a sort of lay sermon, perhaps quite inappropriate to my congregation. But the words that I have said are what has survived as meaningful from a lifetime as student and teacher. They are a testament of my conviction that the hope of the world lies in the revival of that union of reason and faith, of beauty and love, which is the power and the glory of the "Great Tradition." 11</page></plain_text>
