DEWITT VICTORIA COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO An important essay of Epicurus was entitled irept 4avTraalas. This term denotes a true presentation of a single, existent object, though reduced to scale, as it registers itself upon the vision and mind of a sane, sober, and waking person, and stands in contrast to 6avT&amp;rTraiara or ca/raTaw/oL, which denote hybrid, distorted, or indistinct presentations. In the phrase carrvTac-TK7 elirtq%X1 the adjective is essential, not otiose, carrying the specific meaning of 4arvTcaoLa. In the system of Epicurus the term 6davo&amp;a corresponds to the ao4la of Archytas, a sublimated faculty of mental vision; both Archytas and' Epicurus deliberately shunned the use of vovs, which had been loaded with objectionable connotations by Anaxagoras and Plato. The word e&amp;'rt#oX' comes from e7rt6AXXw in the sense of 'fall upon'; it means 'incidence of vision, view' and belonged perhaps to the Asiatic KOLPv. Both Lucretius and Cicero misunderstood it to mean 'hurling at', as of hurling the mind into space, animi iactus liber. In so doing they were misled by the prevailing fancy of a free flight of the mind or the soul through the universe. Some falsely ascribed this notion to Archytas and Epicurus, both of whom assumed, on the contrary, a fixed, imaginary point of view, a lofty arx or aKoIrtL. To the criteria of truth as stated by Epicurus, aloT0?aELs, rpoMt4Es, and rd-Oq, certain later disciples added the awraTorusal f7r30oXal T7s &amp;Lavolas.l Although this fact would lead us to ascribe specific meaning and exceptional importance to the above phrase, the conclusion has been reached in recent dis- cussions of the Epicurean theory of cognition that the adjec- tive aVacrlaoK- is otiose, "because it is impossible to imagine an 1l-LfoXt1 which is not 0avrao-rLKW." 2 I am here venturing to assemble evidence from the text of Epicurus for believing that an C'(rL#3oXr may derive from a avrraala, which is true, or from a odvraca/a, which is either false or undependable. In the former case it will be 4aVTraoL-K? and quite conceivably included among criteria of truth. That no slight importance attaches to the term avwraoLa is I Diogenes Laertius 10.31. 2 Cyril Bailey, Epicurus (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1926), 271.2.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. lxx] Epicurus, HEp' IarraToLas 415 proven by the fact that an essay entitled -wp' ckavwraalas is cited by Diogenes Laertius in a select list of 41 writings declared to represent the best work of Epicurus.3 In this list the essay follows another entitled rep' d&amp;,@Xwv, and in the Epistle to Herodotus the term first occurs after the description of the idols, where the discussion turns to errors associated with vision. It is clear, therefore, where the concept belongs in the organization of Epicurean thought.4 Epicurus in this passage, Herodotus 50, describing the mech- anism of true vision, speaks of the stream of idols "delivering the picture (4avrraoav) and preserving the affinity (ovMlrOaELav) between the picture and object." If any doubt may here arise that cavra-ala, as opposed to Oavrra'aaTa or 4avTaaluoL, does not denote the true picture, this uncertainty ought to be dispelled by the subsequent statement: "and whatever picture (4avTaorav) we may receive thus instantaneously (ETl0X-qUWS) through the mind or senses, whether of the shape or attributes, this is the shape of the solid body... Another item of direct evidence is found in section 80. Arguing here against astronomers who insist upon single expla- nations of heavenly phenomena, Epicurus rebukes them for "admitting the dependability of vision from distances." The Greek runs: rmv (K Trcv &amp;aoT-rqya.wv 4avTaoiav irapa&amp;a56wvTP, which some editors emend, and all, as I believe, mistranslate. Usener's clever emendation, 7raptlP6ovTP 'overlooking', permits Hicks to translate: "overlooking the fact that the objects are only seen at a distance." This is tolerable as a paraphrase but if we assign to 4avTaoia the meaning it bears in 50, there is no need of emendation: "admitting true vision from dis- tances." It is not an error of 'overlooking' but a deliberate assumption on the part of the astronomers that leads Epicurus to despise them. In the Pythocles heavenly phenomena, being too remote for clear vision, are styled avwrai,oLara. Even the 3 Diog. L.10.28. 4 I fail to identify any equivalent of 4cavraTcuta in Lucr. 4; it would be expected before 379, where he passes from true vision to seeming errors.</page><page sequence="3">416 Norman W. DeWitt [1939 rainbow is a ca/vraorMa and three explanations of its form are offered. Contrast with this the image of an ox at twenty paces, which presents a 4avrraoa admitting of but one inter- pretation. It is well to note that earthly phenomena in the Pythocles are called evapyt'iara as contrasted with remote and undependable heavenly phenomena, Oavraiauara.5 In the Herodotus 51 visual errors are under discussion. Of these two kinds are recognized: (1) the visions of sleep or other hallucinations, significantly styled 4avrraoAol; (2) errors of waking vision, when some reaction (K1V-aCS) occurs within the observer, "associated with the oarraoi-n) EIIr-Lo0X7 but with a difference." Error may or may not be involved. Here it is obvious that 4aVTaan0K? 0i-4o denotes the true picture as registered on the vision and the mind, like 4avrraoa of the preceding section. Both are opposed to error and to davwraoAol precisely as ivapnyt'ama are opposed to 4avracaruara in the Pythocles. There is a difference, of course, between 4avwraoa and 4avra- o-K7tK?7 e7IL/0X\. It is this, that the former denotes a true presentation of an existing object while the latter denotes the registration of the same upon the vision or the mind. False presentations also register themselves; they are &amp;XqeOe-s, 'real', but they are not 'true' as a Oavrraoa is real and true. They are fizr3oXaL but not 4aVTrao-KaL. The oft-repeated statement that Epicurus declares all visions to be true is unwarranted.6 The visions of the delirious or the insane, he would say, are 'real' but not necessarily 'true.' The word aXt16's is am- biguous, as also is the Latin verus. It is possible to define avwracLa with still greater precision. It denotes the image formed at the center of vision by the 5 Pythocles 88, 102, 110; 91, 93, 96. Although the two terms are nowhere placed in juxtaposition, it must be noted that 4avT6aclaTa are represented as admitting of several explanations while kvapyiyiaTa as the standard of truth must admit of but one each. 6 R.

In this case the projector is the material object discharging idols, which create "the visual effect of unity and continuity", or in the words of the master himself in the Herodotus 50, rovi Evos KaL ovvexov-s r7v 4avraoLav. It must be interjected, however, that no such speed is neces- sary as Epicurus insists upon. Motion pictures are taken at the rate of sixteen frames per second and only a moderately higher rate is employed in projection. This comparison, it will at once be recognized, has an inverse application because the projection machine enlarges the image while the image denoted as 4avraoLa is reduced in size. Even in an epitome, the loss of dimension suffered by the idols in their transit from the object to the eye could hardly have been overlooked by Epicurus, as it seems to have been over- looked by Lucretius. In the Herodotus 49, he speaks of the streams of idols "invading our eyes or minds KMmT ro' vapuoTrov Ae&amp;yEOos." Bailey takes uye0os in the sense of XcE7r6rT7s; he annotates: "the grosser images affect the sight, the more subtle pass directly into the mind." Hicks in the Loeb version seems to concur. It seems much easier to translate " according to the proportionate size ", that is, reduced to scale, like the image of an elephant on the pupil of the eye. This idea of reduction to scale is explicitly stated in 50: Kara TO 7f IvKVWMa X EYKaTIaAXELa /To- ro3 dAov. To speak first of the second of these perplexing phrases, the meaning is made clear by a passage of Sextus Empiricus,7 who explains the reduction of images according to Epicurus as being effected by the detrition of the edges of the idols during their transit from the object to the eye. What reaches the eye, therefore, and there registers itself, is a 'residue', f-YKara-\XELu,4a, of the life-sized idols as they are discharged from the object. About this there can be little argument. From another point of view this residue of the idols, which 7 Sextus Empiricus A dv.

DeWitt [1939 constitutes the oavraoLa, is a 'condensation', because, if the detrition of the idols is uniform, the result is ro E471S 7r Kvwlcua, 'the orderly reduction' or, as we might say, reduction to scale. In the Herodotus 36, a similar use of 7rV-Kvwua occurs. In 35, Epicurus, employing the terminology of vision, calls his epitome t' Mpopa eirt3OXM, 'the composite view', as opposed to 'the large-scale detailed view', rO Kara A-cpos aKpL/,3W,a, which has reference to his monographs on particular topics. Then he concludes: "for the reduced or synoptic view (TO 1r7KV.KVWIa) of the integrated conspectus of the complete system cannot be attained unless one knows how to incorporate in it by means of succinct statements the part that may be worked out in detail." 8 This is the language of vision, virtually of a map-maker, clearly distinguishing between reduced and en- larged diagrams. The procedure of modern aerial surveys, by which consecutive individual photographs are pieced to- gether, trimmed, and combined to form an integrated map, which is then rephotographed to furnish a small-scale map, affords a precise parallel to the concept Epicurus entertained of the relationship between his special treatises and his epitomes. It is a minor question whether ' ^s is to be read with f'yKaTa- X.ELt,a as well as with 7rV'Kvwua. Editors differ, but since none of them, so far as I can discover, recognizes the principle of the reduction of the image, I believe that all follow false clues. In sense the adverb goes with both terms, because 7yKa'a XEL/I,ca implies, to concoct a phrase on the model of Sextus Empiricus, 6v fs 6pavou-rv rCov rep,rwv ro- d&amp;A@ov. The residual image, being the result of uniform detrition, must itself be 'orderly.' Otherwise it would not be a avrraoia, being distorted, but a 44avTaaAua. 8 Herodotus 36 end: I read ev acrCp with the Mss., referring to IrbKvcoI.a 'synoptic view', in preference to Usener's iv abiCp, referring to the disciple. In my judgment Usener, Bailey, and R. D. Hicks, Diogenes Laertius (London, William Heinemann; New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, in the Loeb Classical Library, 1931) all fail to understand the relationship of the epitomes to the major works of Epicurus. The meaning of e,u7repLaXcei^v is 'incorporate into, embody in', not 'embrace'; each detail, as mastered, is to be incorporated into the general system.</page><page sequence="6">Vol. lxx] Epicurus, IlepL 'barTaoLcas 419 To these three attributes of the 4avraoia, namely, unity, freedom from distortion, and orderly reduction, must be added avclra-eLa. Of the stream of idols the text says, 50: Ka' Tm' ovJtraOeLcw a&amp;l TOL a rOKELV ToPTWP. The key to the mean- ing seems to lie in the association of vision with touch. If in the darkness a cube or a sphere is taken in the hand, these shapes are recognized by touch. Since they are also recog- nized by vision, the stream of idols must possess the capacity to stimulate the eyes and the mind in the same way.9 The r a-Oos, reaction or response, as modern psychology terms it, is similar in the two instances. Therefore the object and the 4a'wraoa may be described as av,uLra0eZM. I would translate: "preserving the affinity with the original object." This topic would bear more detailed treatment than is needed here, because a doctrine of 'sympathy' seems to be an assumption of Epicurus and was possibly stated explicitly in some treatise lost to us. It may even have been a legacy from earlier physical speculations.'0 It happens that the term avA.raOeLa is also found in 48, at the end, joined with &amp;4payeLa. This confirms a statement of Sextus Empiricus, in the passage cited above, that Epicurus em- ployed the latter term as a substitute for oacraola. His state- ment, in turn, lends support to my thesis that 4awrTala applies only to presentations that register themselves with fidelity, because there is no doubt that ivaipyeL applies only to things distinctly perceived and recognized. The parallel use of fvapfr1/uaTa in the Pythocles, as opposed to undependable heavenly OavTao-/caTa, has already been mentioned. It may be added, however, that evaipeLa is a more inclusive term than aVTraoLa, since it applies also to phenomena of hearing and smell. By way of summary it may then be said that oavTaoLa, as 9 Lucr.. ed. by Adolphus Brieger (Leipzig, Teubner, 1902), 4.230-6. 10 Hicks, op. cit. (see note 6), 236: the rejection of the Platonic and Empedo- clean theories of vision does not preclude an analogouls principle of 'sympathy', the subtler atoms of the soul responding to impulses that escape the coarser texture of the physical eye.

It scarcely needs to be added that the observer is assumed to be a sane, sober, and waking person, because the visions of all others are or may be avwraiowara or 4avwrac,ot."1 These hybrid, distorted, and fantastic images also register themselves, of course; they are b1rl-3oXaL but not OavTacrTLKaL. Consequently they are not criteria of truth. Lastly, the inclusion of the 4aVTaaTTLKal EIl-3oXal among the criteria by later Epicureans, though not illogical, was gra- tuitous, because the category was amply covered by the broader term al6o-&amp;07s. In employing a familiar term with a slightly restricted meaning, as in the case of rpO6X4s, Epicurus is following his usual practice.'2 The assumption of a distinction between 4aVTacLYa and 4a'VTao-Aa is shadowed in popular usage and shared by the Stoics.'3 They employed 4avTaa-a KaTacLX7-TLKt in somewhat the same way as Epicurus used avrTa-TLKe E7r'L3oX77.'4 In fact they displayed a penchant for KaraXa/4a3vco and deriva- tives, which occasions some objection to the translation of E1rL/30X7 as "act of apprehension " or the like, adopted by Bailey and here and there by Hicks.'5 Epicurus did not think of the mind as prehensile but as impressionable; the data of the senses " fall upon " it and register themselves.

It remains to cite reasons for discounting the term 7rq3oX'7, upon which mistaken stress has been laid in recent contro- versies to the neglect of Oavraoia and OavTaaTTLK?. The word is not to be explained by etymologizing, because it belongs in a numerous class of compounds of which the etymology is determined by the meaning rather than the meaning by the etymology. It occurs thirteen times in the extant text of Epicurus and only in discussion of physical problems. In four instances it means "view", coinciding with this English word rather precisely, that is, denoting either an act of vision or of the mind."6 This use is exemplified in Diogenes of Oenoanda, in other Epicurean texts, and abundantly in Byzantine Greek, though not in Attic.'7 In other examples it occurs four times with auivota and three times with 4arraoTLK'."8 The former use, in my opinion, belongs to the Asiatic KOlW, while the restricted use is an Epicurean modification exactly as in the case of rpo'Xqn's and 4avraacla. To clear the way for (irt#o, a word must be said about ct'avota. Why did Epicurus choose to make a specialty of the use of this word? The answer is to be found in the philosophy of Anaxagoras and Plato. The former had loaded the word vois with connotations of which no successor could divest it, and these had been confirmed by Plato, to whom Epicurus was particularly adverse. The doctrine that the physical order of the universe found its cause in an ordering mind was 16 Herod. 35, 36 (bis), 83. 17 The absence of this word from Hermann Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorso- kratiker5 (3 vols.; Berlin, Weidmann, 1934-1937) and its frequency in later Greek suggests that its vogue was due to Epicurus.

Moreover, the notion that mind or soul could function apart from the body or become capable of a free flight through the universe was equally incompatible with his thought.'9 It is not surprising, there- fore, that not a single instance of voi3s is to be found in the extant works of Epicurus. Incidentally this fact devalues the suggestion that iwr4oXo is elliptically related to eirtaMXetv r6v vou3v.20 With respect to vois, the position of Archytas of Tarentum was similar. Rejecting this term, as being already pre-empted and spoiled for particular uses, he chose to bestow a special meaning upon the word aoOtfa, conceiving of it as a sublimated faculty of mental vision, capable of penetrating all physical truth and comparable to the sun in heaven looking down upon the universe.2' In contrast to the free flight of the soul through the universe he entertained the fancy of an imaginary, fixed point of view, TKO7rLa, from which his peculiarly conceived Wisdom looked down upon all things.22 The result is a despectus or circumspectus. This matches rather precisely with "the master view", ? KVpltTcrTa7 ir-30oXr of Epicurus.23 There is no suggestion anywhere of a flight of the soul or mind or of a shifting point of view. Epicurus, of course, denied his indebtedness to any prede- cessor, which is to be appraised merely as shrewd propaganda on the part of a leader ambitious to become the founder of a sect. Nevertheless the powers he implicitly assumes for btaLvoLa are very similar to those claimed for aoola by Archytas.

It is worth while to recall that " incidence " is technical in modern physics in this sense, whether of light or of force. If something must be added to fira3oXr to elucidate the meaning, this would certainly be rTs 6eCWS,25 but this is no more necessary than the addition of 'of the eyes' to English 'view.' When the word first meets us in the text of Epicurus it is already charged with a composite force, just as it con- tinued to be in Byzantine Greek. The innovation of Epicurus consisted in the addition of rTs &amp;avooLas, when once his choice had settled upon this colorless term to denote the faculty of mental vision in preference to the flighty and volatile vovis of his predecessors. The genitive ris SLavoLas is best understood as subjective, as if we said " glance of the mind, flash of insight." The mind or the intellect is the active agent, not a projectile or the object of the action as in the animi iactus liber of Lucretius, to be discussed presently. These mental actions take place at atomic speed, this fact being connoted when Epicurus employs the phrase "quick as thought." 26 The explanation of Lucretian misunderstandings calls for a brief detour among his contemporaries. The study of Archytas enjoyed a certain vogue in Rome during the later years of the Republic. For example, the author of the Ciris in his prologue twice employs the word sophia, transliterated and not translated, to denote the mistress of physical science 24 Iambl., op. cit.

Moreover, the Archytan fixed point of view, aKOIrUa, is dis- tinctly referred to as an arx: si me iam summa Sapientia pangeret arce, (quattuor antiquis heredibus est data consors) unde hominum errores longe lateque per orbem despicere atque humilis possem contemnere curas. *28 Here we have, manifestly, a contamination of the Archytan physical despectus with the ethical despectus of Lucretius 2.7-10: sed nil dulcius est, bene quam munita tenere edita doctrina sapientum templa serena, despicere unde queas alios passimque videre errare atque viam palantis quaerere vitae. To render this contamination yet more complex the author of the Ciris represents himself as established in an Epicurean garden, Cecropius hortulus, and dreams of fabricating a peplus, upon which shall be depicted the rerum natura,29 and this in spite of the fact that his despectus was ethical and not physical. A like confusion has victimized even a modern scholar. The late Roger William Jones, in an extremely useful article, has traced the myth or fancy of the free flight of the mind through the universe from Pindar onward to Christian writers.30 Archytas, however, he overlooks or ignores, and he falsely describes Epicurus as sharing in the fancy. "These ideas ", he states, "were current in the (Epicurean) school from the earliest period.

The general principle holds good, opav ra opara, Oec&amp;pevLV ra a6para, and the latter denotes the vision of the mind.33 The world of atoms and void is known only by reason. Even the gods and their attributes come to our knowledge by a process of thought: imaginibus similitudine et transitione perceptis, i.e. 'by analogy and transfer.' 34 For example, how do we know that the gods are anthropomorphic? Because there is an analogy between the most perfect of beings, man, and the absolutely perfect, god. Human beings are the most beautiful of earthly creatures. Therefore the gods must be anthropomorphic. This step of reasoning is transitio, guer63aats, from the seen to the unseen.35 It is sig- nificant that Jones finds nothing to quote from Epicurus him- self, misquotes Metrodorus, and has nothing left except a brace of passages from the prejudiced Plutarch and Bishop 31 I bid ., 1I1 1-3. 32 Herod. 63-6; Lucr. 3.548-633. 33 Atoms, void, and the gods are known only by reason, i.e., by analogy and transfer: Herod. 59; cf. 47 and 62; frag. 49 Bailey, 212 Usener; Rat.

Horace Odes 1.28.4-6: nec quicquam tibi prodest aerias temptasse domos animoque rotundum percurrisse polum morituro. It is manifest here that the poet has substituted the free flight of the mind for the fixed point of view, YKO7rWad, of Archytas, which was correctly termed an arx in the Ciris. Cicero ex- hibits the same confusion: si immensam et interminatam in omnis partis magnitudinem regionum videretis, in quam se iniciens animus et intendens ita late longeque peregrinatur. . *36 The last word betrays him, peregrinatur; he has erro- neously intruded the idea of the free flight of the soul. It is this error, I think, that accounts in part at least for his render- ing of e7-7rt0oX7T rT7s tapoLas as se iniciens animus. He thinks of Epicurus as 'discharging his mind like an arrow (intendens) or, as we should say, like a rocket', for a flight through the heavens. Even for this use of 7rL4a'XXw I find no parallel in Attic Greek. As for the Asiatic use, 'incidence of vision, view', this was probably unknown to him, as it was to Lucretius. This is not astonishing. Romans who made the mistake of associating 7rrTCoa ts aLLTLcLTtKfl with aLrOLLoAaL, 'accuse', and rendered it casus accusativus, instead of connecting it with aLTLa, cause, objective', may well have misunderstood the Asiatic word cirL3ooXM, 'incidence of vision, view.' It is quite possible that Cicero followed Lucretius in using se iniciens. The model was offered in Lucretius 2.739-40: in quae corpora si nullus tibi forte videtur posse animi iniectus fieri, procul avius erras. That Lucretius, like Cicero, misconceived Epicurus as " hurling his mind into space " is manifest from animi iactus liber of 2.1044-7: 36 Cicero N.D. 1.20.54.</page><page sequence="14">Vol. lxx] Epicurus, Ilep' dI)avraalas 427 quaerit enim rationem animus, cum summa loci sit infinita foris haec extra moenia mundi, quid sit ibi porro quo prospicere usque velit mens atque animi iactus liber quo pervolet ipse. The words quo pervolet ipse betray him; he has intruded into his interpretation of Epicurus the prevalent fancy of the free flight of the mind through the universe. Even if we consented to associate Cbrt3oXi7 with the phrase i-q7rt#aXeX T6v voiov, this does not mean "hurl the mind at" but "apply the mind to." If additional evidence of misinterpretation and contamina- tion is timely, this may be found in the well known passage, 1.72-4: ergo vivida vis animi pervicit, et extra processit longe flammantia moenia mundi atque omne immensum peragravit mente animoque. Lucretius was primarily a poet, of course, and the flight of the soul is especially alluring to poets, but he is still to be charged with misapprehending the difference between this and a despectus from an imaginary fixed point of view, as expressly set forth by Archytas and adumbrated by Epicurus, in con- trast to the concept of the human soul in the Phaedrus 246-7, for example, furnished with a chariot and winged steeds. Incidentally, Diogenes Laertius may not have been so far astray in classifying Epicurus with the Italian school of philos- ophy.37 His theory of cognition is built in part upon a transfer of the peculiar Archytan ao4la, disguised as b&amp;ApoLa, to Demo- critean physics.38 37 1.1S. 38 The editor kindly calls my attention to Lucr. 2.740 and 3.245, where editors note that Epicurus seems to think of thought as functioning in two ways: (1) as stimulated by the simulacra or (2) by self-determined actions of atoms. I interpret irtfoXlo ris Stavolas as being a phase, but not the only phase, of the latter, closely approximating to intuition (intueor) and very suggestive of Spinoza's scientia intuitiva for the reason that it penetrates to the unseen.</page></plain_text>
