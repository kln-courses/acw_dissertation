<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Philosophical Review, Vol. XCVIII, No. 2 (April 1989) SCHELLING'S TREATISE ON THE ESSENCE OF HUMAN FREEDOM. By MARTIN HEIDEGGER. Translated by JOAN STAMBAUGH. Athens, Ohio, Ohio University Press, 1985. Pp. 195. This work reproduces a lecture course given at the University of Frei- burg in the summer of 1936 together with supplementary notes dating from 1941-43 which contrast the metaphysics of German Idealism with the thematic of being and time. As the translator justly remarks, "this is perhaps the most straightforward study of Heidegger to appear in En- glish." Like the studies on Kant and Nietzsche, these lectures allow a re- markably candid ingress to the author's philosophical preoccupations. Like the Kant lectures, these are marked by an impeccable academic style. Schelling's text is historically and critically situated, then addressed in ex- haustive detail. The latter is a distinct virtue in view of the strangeness of Schelling's 1809 essay on human freedom. Though in part Schelling's thought moves in the domain of traditional metaphysical questions such as the justification of evil and the compatibility of human freedom and pantheism, other concerns lead him toward the romantic-idealist vision of a world where nature and spirit structurally belong together, until finally he overleaps the bounds of rational philosophy altogether with his thought of the absolute as a primal Ungrund from which emerge both nature (ground) and spirit (existent God) in a process of volition and deci- sion. It is this latter move which most attracts Heidegger's attention, though the way Schelling's speculation moves within the reifying ambit of a metaphysics of permanent presence generates alternating waves of at- traction towards and revulsion from the earlier thinker. Schelling's Treatise 260</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS thus serves as an instructive example of the proposed "destruction of the history of metaphysics" (Sein und Zeit, sec. 6). Space does not permit a full outline of Schelling's course of thought in the Treatise; the way Heidegger situates the work in the course of German Idealism and Western metaphysics in general and a sketch of its major divisions will suffice. The clearing of being or the event of truth is pri- mordially conceptualized atemporally and ahistorically as presence or per- manence-being as idea and ousia (Plato). The tension between truth as disclosure and as rigidified standing for public inspection is seen in Aris- totle's double-mindedness about the object of first philosophy, "being as being" and "the highest being"; Schelling's treatise still moves within this double-mindedness and, despite some conceptual aerobatics designed to overcome it, ultimately falls prey to its temptation to reify being as theion. Next, being is conceptualized as ground and cause (Aristotle). With Des- cartes primary being is redefined as representation, and with Leibniz as self- presentation-the one whose essence is a striving to reduce a multitude of presentations to a unity. Finally, in the Treatise Schelling is impelled by the whole logic of Western and especially German metaphysics to declare that will is primordial being. His conceptualization of will as timeless (along with Nietzsche's characterization of will as eternal return) brings meta- physics to a close-also sprach Heidegger. Against this background we can understand Heidegger's division of Schelling's discussion (and the disproportionate amount of attention de- voted to earlier concerns). A first section devoted to preliminary discus- sions focuses on the requirements of a philosophical system in contrast to the humanly experienced need for freedom. The second and most sub- stantial sketches a "system of freedom" as a progression from lifeless pantheism (Spinoza) to a metaphysics of will and defines human freedom as the emergence of a capacity for good and evil. The third section delin- eates a metaphysics of evil, wherein the possibility and reality of evil (= freedom) is explained by a process of theo- and cosmogenesis which is at once a theory of the creation of humankind and an answer to the nagging demands of philosophical theodicy. I shall briefly indicate Schelling's major conceptual moves in each of these sections, noting affinities with Heidegger's own concerns. (1) System mirrors, or, less cautiously, is, the 'jointure" (Fug: structure) of being itself. It takes place in and through Dasein's awareness of its his- torical situation (= Schelling's "intellectual intuition")-both thinkers' "method" is avowedly anthropomorphic. The conditions of the emer- gence of system in modern thought is that a foundation of certainty is supplied by first principles (as in mathematics), that it be located in the self-certainty of the cogito which serves as a foundation for all judgment, that theology or Church dogma be subjectivized or psychologized, and 261</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS that action emerges as the liberation of humankind unto itself-in economy, technology, art, ultimately genius. (2) Against the fatalism of Spinozistic pantheism (immanence), Schelling urges that the very feeling of human freedom requires system, that is, a conceptual outworking of conditioned unconditionedness. This requires an understanding of the "is" in "God is man" on the model of indifference, the unity of unity and opposition or the belonging together of what is different. Schelling then interprets this pantheistic identity processively, in terms of a metaphysics of will. The jointure of being involves the emergence of ground and exis- tence from primal indifference (Ungrund), the divine assertion of exis- tence (universality, spirit) over ground vis-a-vis the contingent relation of the principles (universal will, particular will) in humankind = the capacity for good and evil, and finally the teleological reunification of the prin- ciples in love. Heidegger identifies this mythic process with the historical situatedness of human existence, wherein freedom is realized not as arbi- trariness or momentary spontaneity but as the necessity of decidedness, the decidedness seen in phenomena such as heroism, enthusiasm, faith. (3) In the metaphysics of evil which Schelling offers as the explanation of the reality of freedom, a theo- and cosmogonic creative process is sketched out that transits from a primal longing of the irrational ground to the enunciation of the will to understanding, the speaking of the word, which occurs in the separation of the existent from the ground, to the establish- ment of spirit or the will to love as their at first contingent unification in humankind, and finally in history to their absolute reunification. Hei- degger himself underplays this tripartite psychology (and Trinitarian the- ology) and stresses the decisiveness of human beings, and the contingent or historical nature of being's openness or revelation.
