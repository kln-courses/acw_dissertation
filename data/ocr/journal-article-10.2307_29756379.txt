<plain_text><page sequence="1">Report on the Excavations at Aligrama (Swat, Pakistan) 1974 by Giorgio Stacul and Sebastiano Tusa In Autumn 1974, the Italian Archaeological Mission resumed excavation work at Ali? grama, in the Sw?t Valley in the framework of IsMEO activity (Centro Studi e Scavi Ar cheologici in Asia) in cooperation with the University of Trieste C). The purpose of the research was to obtain further evidence of the extent and of the occupation periods of the protohistoric settlement partially unearthed during previous excavations (2). To this end trenches were dug in three different sectors: trenches E and F in the vicinity of the hill slopes, not far from trench D dug in 1973; and trench K on the top of the hill overlooking the town of Aligr?ma, where the remains of masonry and archaeo? logical finds from various ages were visible on the surface (fig. 1). Trench E The field-surface of trench E slopes slightly over a large field terrace running as far as the foot of the hillside where the rock outcrops. The dig had an area of 18 X 4 m. with the long axis of the trench running in an uphill-downhill direction. Part of this trench was separated from the east end of trench D by a balk two metres wide. In the course of the work some superimposed masonry structures were unearthed which attested to a succession of construction phases (figs. 2-5). In order to ensure the preservation of these structures, after the removal of the upper layers the area of excavation was restricted to three separate sectors, respectively uphill (El), in the centre (E2) and downhill (E3). (*) The drawings and the photographs are by the authors. The drawings were further elaborated by Mr Giusto Almerigogna and by the architect Dr Luca Mariani. Drawings and photographs are filed in the archives of the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale, Rome. (x) The excavations were directed by Dr G. Stacul with the help of Dr S. Tusa. The Mission was joined by Mr Khan Mohammad, Curator of the Swat Museum, representative of the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan, assisted by Mr Fazal Wahid, Supervisor at the same Museum. (2) Earlier excavations in the Aligr?ma area, which revealed construction phases belonging to the protohistoric settlement were carried out in 1966 (trench A), 1972 (trench B), 1973 (trench C and D). As regards these works see: G. Stacul, S. Tusa, ? Report on the Excavations at Aligr?ma (Sw?t, Pakistan) 1966, 1972 ?, EW, XXV, 1975, pp. 291-321; G. Stacul, ?

Sketch map of the archaeological site.</page><page sequence="3">No masonry structures were recovered in the El area except for wall h although the excavations reached a depth of nearly eight metres with a surface area which gradually dim? inished down to 3.50 X 3.30 m. The sequence of layers closely resembles the one found in the adjoining area downhill from trench D, and, from top to bottom, is as follows: ? layer ?, greyish soil stirred by recent ploughing; ? layer ?, greyish in colour with charcoal remains and potsherds; ? layer &lt;5), light-coloured, partly clayey, almost completely lacking in charcoal re? mains and potsherds; ? layer ?, dark grey and very stony, rich in charcoal remains and potsherds; at its base traces of reddish-brown floor level; ? layer ?, greyish in colour with potsherds and charcoal remains; ? layer ?, mainly sandy and almost barren; ? layer ?, preyish in colour with charcoal remains; at its base traces of reddish brown floor level; ? layer ?, mainly sandv and gravelly and almost barren; ? layer ?, greyish in colour, with charcoal remains and potsherds; ? layer ?, dark-grey in colour, rich in humus, in charcoal remains and in pot? sherds; ? layer ?, mainly stony and sandy; ? layer @, mainly sandy and gravelly; ? layer @, dark in colour, particularly rich in humus, in charcoal remains and in potsherds; at its base, traces of hearth level; ? layer @, mainly sandy and almost barren. This stratigraphic sequence confirmed the evidence obtained during the previous ex? cavation of trench D, in which a similar sequence was found in the downhill area. It is significant that in trench D a completely barren layer was reached at a depth of about eight metres consisting of river pebbles, gravel and sand (layer ?). In view of this preceding evidence, work in the El area was halted during the removal of layer ?. Unlike area El, the excavation of the E2 and E3 areas provided evidence about the masonry of different periods. These areas were found to have been the site of intensive human occupation as is proved by the multiple superimposition of masonry and floor levels and the large quantity of sherds and other finds in the layers connected with these various construction phases. The restricted area of the dig at the deeper levels allowed the rooms related to the masonry to be only partially unearthed. 153</page><page sequence="4">pit t p e. h \ It k dr m N " 'll 1 1 05 0 1m Fig. 2 - Aligrama.

Trench E; section A-A\</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4 - Aligr?ma. Trench E; plan showing the structural phases. From bottom to top, the construction phase sequence is as follows: Phase 1. The earliest construction phase is attested to by wall u&gt; built of very irregularly shaped blocks of stone often exceeding half a metre in thickness (figs. 26, 29). The use of stone blocks of comparable size was found to be peculiar to this construction phase and can be used as a definite element of distinction as regards the masonry common to phases belonging to later periods. In connection with this wall, a reddish clay floor level can be found at the base of layer @. Throughout layer @, which is blackish in colour and very rich in humus, considerable quantities of potsherds, charcoal remains and fragments of animal bones were found. These remains were concentrated mainly in the lower levels of the layer near the floor level. Phase 2. Clearly separated from the preceding phase by layers ? and ?, partly sandy and gravelly, where the potsherds collected were relatively few in number and the char? coal remains completely absent. The phase is attested by wall t, which is slightly curved and built of average size stone blocks with chip fillings and visible faces only partly fin? ished (figs. 25, 26, 29). It has been preserved only up to a height of 0.30-0.35 m. In connection with this wall there are traces of floor level consisting of very hard compact 156</page><page sequence="7">0 1 57 f oo oCD fo Ia topo 1 573</page><page sequence="8">soil at the base of layer ?. The whole of layer ? and particularly its lower levels is rich in humus, charcoal remains and potsherds. Phase 3. This includes the rooms separated by wall q which consists of irregularly shaped stone blocks and river pebbles, with carefully finished visible surfaces (fig. 26). A 1.30 m. wide doorway opens in the wall. At the base of layer ? there is a reddish brown clay floor level of small slab-shaped stones and pottery fragments. Layer ? con? sists of a dark soil rich in charcoal remains and potsherds. Phase 4. Separated from the preceding phase by layer ?, which is mainly stony and sandy. The phase is attested by a room delimited by walls o and /?, connected by a floor level of compact soil mixed with potsherds lying at the base of layer ?. The two walls are built of blocks of stone and river pebbles and the visible surface is roughly finished (figs. 27, 28). Numerous potsherds were recovered near the floor level and on the floor itself. Phase 5. In area E2 it comprises rooms separated by wall /, built of stone blocks of average size in which a 1.15 m. wide doorway opens (figs. 24, 25). In connection with this wall at the base of layer ? traces of a floor level consisting of compact soil and small pebbles can be seen. In area E3 the same phase is related to walls m and n. The masonry work of wall m has been built with particular care and consists of stone blocks of uniform size and visible surfaces carefully finished by chiselling (fig. 30). Phase 6. This includes rooms separated by the walls iy j and k, connected by multiple floor levels consisting of compact soil and potsherds which are superimposed throughout layer ?a (figs. 27, 28). Lying on one of these floors was a rectangular schist slab with two holes on opposite sides (as it lay partly outside the excavation area the slab was removed only in the later 1975 excavations in which trench E was extended in an easterly direction). Wall k has been preserved up to a height of more than one metre but, on the whole, the stones and river pebbles of which it is built are rather irregularly arranged. Related to this phase is also pit 1, which is lined with stone and pebble masonry (fig. 24). There are abundant potsherds on the inside and at the bottom, at a depth of 0.70 m. Layer ? consists of a dark soil, mainly stony. It also contains abundant potsherds, charcoal remains and fragments of animal bones. Phase 7. Layer ? is mainly clayey and distinctly separates this phase from the preceding one. The construction phase includes rooms separated by walls a, c, d and /. The masonry is similar to that commonly found in the preceding phases. Related to these walls are traces of floor levels consisting of reddish clay and compact earth, often superim? posed on one another throughout the layer ?a. In layer ?a a large quantity of char? coal remains and fragments of vases have been recovered. This construction phase includes pit 2, at the bottom of which fragments of large vases have been found. Phase 8. This consists of rooms delimited by walls b and e displaying a building tech? nique that is similar to the preceding phase (fig. 24). At the base of layer ? these walls are 158</page><page sequence="9">associated with reddish or brownish clay floor levels. Part of wall e rests on the underlying wall /. Pottery and Other Finds The finds consist mostly of pottery and it has been possible to reconstruct numerous vases either wholly or partially. Also present were a few spindle-whorls, fragments of human terracotta figurines, stone tools and small copper and iron objects. The presence of iron is attested only in more recent layers, i.e. in association with the last two con? struction phases. On the basis of the typology of the finds it has been ascertained that the various occu? pation phases described previously are related to the cultural periods already attested in Aligr?ma itself and in other Sw?t Valley sites. The earliest construction phase dates back to Period IV in the chronological sequence of Gh?ligai (3), as is shown by the presence of Black-Grey Burnished Ware associated with coarse Gritty Ware. The follow? ing five phases are all related to Period V. In the trench E area no evidence was found of construction phases that could be related to Period VI, as was the case in the nearby trench F (see below). Above layer ? there are the two most recent construction phases, related to an age immediately following Period VII. In the various excavations carried out at Aligr?ma, no evidence has so far been found of construction phases belonging to Pe? riod VII. Period IV The pottery ware can be divided up into two ranges of vases: ? the large cooking or storage vases, grey or brown in colour with gritty surfaces, slipped with sand (fig. 12 j, k, 1); ? the Black-Grey Burnished Ware, which in certain cases displays extremely regular streaks on the inner surface, showing the use of the wheel (figs. 12 a-i, 31, 33). Also present, although in small quantities, is the Red or Brown Ware, fine in fabric and in texture, sometimes painted with black horizontal bands or with white geometrical motifs (fig. 34). Among the most common shapes are jars with flared rim and a cordon on the neck (figs. 12 a-e, i, 31) and the large, wide-mouthed vases, usually with an almost vertical rippled rim (fig. 12 k, 1). Biconical vases with disk-bases (fig. 12 f, g) and vases with (3) G. Stacul, ?Excavation near Gh?ligai (1968) and Chronological Sequence of Pro to historical Cultures in the Sw?t Valley?, EW, XIX, 1969, pp. 44-91. 159</page><page sequence="10">straight rims (fig. 12 h) are attested too. There was also a brown miniature vase with an hour-glass shape (fig. 15 a). The other objects included a discoidal shaped spindle-whorl (fig. 15 d), a spindle whorl with a biconical body (fig. 15 e), a globular shaped spindle-whorl (fig. 15 f), a ter? racotta bobbin (?) (figs. 15 j, 32) and a stone axe with a round hole (fig. 45). Period V The pottery ranges and shapes are very close to those already found in the tombs in the protohistoric graveyards of the Sw?t Valley. In dealing with these vases, we shall thus refer to the typological classification used in describing the funeral furnishings found in the above graves (4). The majority of the large vase fragments belong to the red-brown ovoidal jars with flared rim (VT 68) (fig. 13 i, j), and to red-brown jars with a high neck (VT 69) (fig. 13 m). There is also a type with a very large mouth, globular-oval body, the diameter of which usually exceeds 0.80 m. (5). Included among the medium-size vases, which are grey or red on the surface, is the vessel with a deep body and vertical rim, or type VT 18 (fig. 13 a), the bell-shaped vase or type VT 21 (figs. 13 d, e, 38, 39), the biconical vessel of type VT 27 (fig. 13 k), and two fragments of a conical stand, probably belonging to a type VT 1 vase (fig. 13 f, g). The other objects include the type of spindle-whorl with a biconical body (fig. 15 c), the one with a discoidal body (fig. 15 g), two terracotta bobbins (?) (fig. 15 k, 1), a frag? ment of human terracotta figurine (fig. 42), a stone axe with central hole (fig. 43), a saddle-quern and pestle (fig. 46) and some schist slabs with two holes on opposite sides and, in one case, with marks of a central groove (figs. 47, 48, 50). A similar slab was found in trench F (fig. 49). Upper layers The pottery recovered in layer ?a included vases made on the fast wheel, mainly red on the surface, of the following shapes: carinated bowl with vertical or almost vertical rim (fig. 14 a-c), carinated bowl with incurved sides (fig. 14 d), carinated bowl with out-turned rim (fig. 14 j, k), bowl with convex sides (fig. 14 f), club-rimmed bowl (fig. 14 n), almost hemispherical bowl (fig. 14 I), carinated dish (fig. 14 e), jar with blunt, sharply everted rim (fig. 14 g, h), jar with short everted rim (fig. 14 o, p). Also from layer ? comes the type of jar with narrow neck and almost vertical rim (fig. 14 1). (4) C. Silvi Antonini, G.

(5) Stacul, Tusa, op. cit., fig. 15 f. 160</page><page sequence="11">Recovered in layer ?a were the beehive-shaped spindle-whorls made of terracotta (fig. 15 h) and also of green soapstone (fig. 15 i). Comparisons and Considerations The excavation of trench E enabled us to extend the evidence obtained during the previous excavations. The first occupation phase occurred in Period IV. As early as 1973, when trench D was dug, trench E attested five construction phases belonging to Period V, i.e. phases 2-6. The use of very large blocks of stone and of river pebbles is a distinctive feature of the Period IV masonry. During the following Period V the prevalent use of blocks and pebbles of uniform, medium size, sometimes with regular finishing on the outside, may be attested. The later phases belonging to Period V displayed no indicative elements to testify to any evolution in the masonry techniques. The various construction phases resemble each other in a striking fashion and the practice of re-using stone material taken from other constructions seems very common. There are definite differences, however, in the field of the industries, first and foremost in the pottery. The great quantity of pot-sherds in all the archaeological layers has allowed the gradual evolution of certain ceramic forms to be followed. The most frequent of the large common vases found in the deeper layers belonging to Period V is the jar with a high neck, i.e. type VT 69 (fig. 13 m). The presence of this type is attested during the early-middle Period V, and it disappears completely after construction phase 4. Frequent throughout Period V is the red-brown jar with a flared rim or type VT 68 (fig. 13 i, j). It is derived from a type common in Period IV (fig. 12a-e, i, j). In con? nection with type VT 68 it must be pointed out that in the lower layers belonging to Period V the body of the vase is ovoidal in shape, while in the upper layers it tends to take on a globular shape. The most common type of medium-size vase found in early Period V is the carinated vessel with deep body, i.e. type VT 27 (fig. 13k). It is derived from a roughly similar type having a shorter body found in the preceding Period IV (fig. 12 f, g). Type VT 27 is distinctly predominant during construction phases 2 and 3. It later tends to lose its cari nation until it is replaced completely by type VT 19, i.e. by a vase with deep body and sinuous profile found mainly in connection with phases 4 and 5 (fig. 37). In addition to type VT 19, also found in connection with phases 4 and 5 are vases corresponding to types VT 18 (fig. 13 a) and VT 21 (figs. 13 b-e, 36, 37). The latter type is found also in late Period V, and is indeed one of the most common shapes in construction phases 5 and 6. Whereas in the early and middle Period V the vases generally display fairly thick walls 161</page><page sequence="12">and high disk-bases, in late Period V these features are less obvious and foreshadow a formal evolution that is quite clear in the following Period VI. It is also interesting to note the absence, in almost all the layers belonging to Pe? riod V, of miniature vases, which are found in surprisingly large quantities in Aligr?ma during Period VI (see below). A few types of miniature vase have been attested only in late Period V, in connection with construction phase 6, obviously foreshadowing the phenom? enon of widespread miniature production which was to characterize the following period. A description has already been given of the probable ritual purposes of the schist slabs with two holes found at Aligr?ma also during previous excavations (6). A signifi? cant find of a slab with two holes and a cavity at the centre is reported from trench E (fig. 47). A similar iconography, probably of anthropomorphic inspiration, perhaps has its fore? runner in a fragment of schist slab previously found in layer ? at Gh?ligai (fig. 51). The whole slab probably had two cavities and a wide central hole. In nearby trench F, phases belonging to Period VI are superimposed over construc? tion phases belonging to late Period V (see below). In trench E on the other hand, super? imposed over the Period V occupation phases is an almost barren layer, and above this, the two most recent construction phases, i.e. phases 7 and 8. Some vases and objects belonging to construction phase 7 resemble common types found in Sw?t Valley graves belonging to Period VII, e.g. the carinated bowl with vertical rim, or type VT 11 (fig. 14 a-c) and the beehive-shaped green-stone spindle-whorl, or type TS 3 (fig. 15 i). However, it is significant that the pottery collected in the upper layers in connection with construction phases 7 and 8 has definite features in common with a ware found at Ch?rsadda I in layers (38) - (28) (7). The main features in common are related to the carinated bowl with almost vertical rim, red and grey also on the surface (8), the carinated bowl with out-turned rim (9), the club-rimmed bowl (10), the carinated dish ("), the jar with short flared rim (12), the jar with blunt, sharply everted rim (13) and the jar with almost vertical rim (14). Significantly absent is the so-called "tulip bowF, which is very frequent at Ch?rsadda I above layer (28). This would seem to indicate that this pottery belongs to a period which according to Wheeler lies between the end of the 4th and the 3rd century B.C. In the Sw?t Valley similar shapes are found in layer ? of the rock shelter at Gh? Ugai (15). Representative data for absolute chronology determination have been obtained from (6) Ibid., pp. 319 f.

In particular, an analysis carried out by the Department of Physical Research of Penn? sylvania University, USA, on a sample taken from layer ? of trench D belonging to the oldest occupation phase of the site gave a result of 1400 + 40 B.C. (half life 5568), i.e. 1500 + 50 B.C. (half life 5730) and 1690- 1710 + 60 B.C. (with MASCA correction factors) (16). Another analysis carried out by the same Department of Pennsylvania University on a sample taken from layer ? of trench D (connected with construction phase 2 of trench E and thus attributable to early Period V) gave 1140 + 40 B.C. (half life 5568), i.e. 1240 + 50 B.C. (half life 5730) and 1460 + 60 B.C. (with MASCA correction factors) (17). Lastly, a dating carried out in the Physical Research Laboratory of Ahmedabad, India, on a sample from layer (7) of trench E (E3), gave 1120 + 230 B.C. (half life 5568), or 1200 + 240 B.C. (half life 5730) or 1380- 1400 + 240 B.C. (with MASCA correction factors) (18). G.S. Trench F Trench F (fig. 6) was dug about 10 m. north of trench E and runs roughly in the same N-W S-E direction (19). It abuts, with a considerable slope, on the rocky sides of the hill of Aligr?ma, which constitute its northwest boundary. Except for this northwest zone, which is separated by a step of land due to farming, the remainder of the trench runs flat (fig. 7). The choice of the site for digging the trench was determined by a number of obser? vations made during magnetic surveys effected in the Aligr?ma area (20) as well as by the necessity of finding out the connection between the structures built on the alluvial slope covered by trenches A, B, C, D and E and the rocky hillside which emerges from it dis? tinctly. During the magnetic survey a striking anomaly was observed in the values ob? tained over a large strip lying 3 m. from the rock wall of the hill and running parallel to it. The problem was thus to establish whether these magnetic indications, lower in value than the surrounding soil, were due to architectural structures near the surface or to the (16) p_2152.

I should like to thank the Physical Research Laboratory of Ahmedabad, and in particular Dr D.P. Agrawal, for their kind cooperation. (19) This is an originally rectangular trench, 10 m. long and 4 m. wide, later extended on the northwest side for a distance of 2 m. on a 3.75 m. front in a SW direction. (20) This prospecting work with the help of a magnetometer was carried out by Prof. S. Man zoni of the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics of the University of Trieste with the collaboration of Mr M. Gergolet. 163</page><page sequence="14">peculiar conformation of the subsoil. The explanation was found to be the latter, as shown below, as at the point indicated by the magnetic anomaly a few centimetres from the sur? face lay a rock shelf connected further northwest to the mass of the Aligr?ma hillside. The depth reached in this northern part of the trench is slight almost throughout, as the bedrock is only a few centimetres below the surface. The rocky surface shows some interesting peculiarities. It has been levelled in the northwest part of the trench, in cor? respondence with the area marked as room 1 and in the area in front of wall b, so as to obtain a perfectly horizontal level without any perceptible roughness (figs. 6, 7, 52). To NE of room 1 two horizontal, parallel floors have been dug out of the rock: they are on different levels and separated by a step a few centimetres high, against which what is left of wall b abuts towards SE. In room 1 the levelling was extended to NW for at least a metre into the rocky part of the hill, so as to create a small artificial shelter. This is the area where the greatest number of pottery, bone and organic finds were made. This is due to the evident use of the area as a dwelling place, and in addition to its peculiar position up against the rocky hillside, which protected it from the process of water erosion that constantly affected the hillside (figs. 54, 55). Under a layer of humus (fig. 7), thicker in the part near the rock wall and contain? ing lenses of rubble which had come down the hillside, we have layer ?, brown, with lots of rubble, and clearly of alluvial origin. This layer partly covered layers ?b and ?c. ?c and ?a, covered by ?, are occupation levels, that is to say, they are floors characterized by a plentiful amount of ashes, charcoal, animal bones and pottery find. Between ?a and ?c there is layer ?b which, having a great deal of rubble and lacking organic substances, points to a temporary abandonment of the site as a dwelling place. In room 1, layer ?, a schist slab was found in situ (figs. 6, 53). It was laid flat and has an irregular oval outline with two holes at the two ends of the main axis, and is similar to analogous artifacts found at Aligr?ma, in trenches B and E (21). Nearby, in the same layer, a baked clay tablet about 5 cm. thick was found, lying perfectly flat and with an irregular rectangular shape. The fact that both objects had been placed on floor ?a adds an important element for a knowledge of their purpose, which was probably con? nected to practices of a ritual nature or in any case of a special kind (22). Under the clay tablet described above, an animaPs skull was found. It was not very large and had small horns (bovid) (23). It lay in the midst of numerous miniature pots. On floor ?c other schist slabs were found, this time without holes, but also arranged so as to form a kind of paving at floor level (24). On the same floor a large group of large-sige animal bones (21) Similar objects from trench E are described in the foregoing contribution by G. Stacul. (22) It is noteworthy in this connection that a similar slab with two holes at the ends has been found on the burial floor of a tomb in the Aligr?ma graveyard dated as Period VII. (23) Recently analysed by Dr B. Compagnoni, the skull was found to belong to a young bovid. (24) In the settlement of Aligr?ma it is a fre? quent occurrence to find slabs buried here and there in the floors but without any order or apparent function. 164</page><page sequence="15">were found (mainly bovids mixed with sheep and goats) (25) lying near the rock wall in the vicinity of the small artificial shelter in the same place where, among other things, also half a small-size, anatomically connected animal skeleton was found (26). Connected to layer ?c is pit 2 (fig. 6) which has been partially excavated in ex? tension as some of it lies outside the excavation area. It has been dug out of the rock; it displays no traces of stone lining or of plaster. It is 1.25 m. deep, and must have been about 1.80 m. wide. It has a round bottom. Situated near its northern edge is a large river pebble, as is customary in a few of the stone-walled pits found at Aligr?ma (27). As can be inferred from the description given of the stratigraphic section, little now remains of the original construction layout of the area because of the heavy erosion it has undergone, especially during the accumulation of layer ? which has cut straight through the occupation levels and destroyed practically all the structures in them (only a small portion of wall b is left). In the layer ? filling large quantities of rubble were found in the central part of the trench which, in all probability, is all that is left of the previously existing structures uphill. Pit 1 is isolated in the central part of the trench (fig. 6) and is covered entirely by layer ?. It is 0.60 m. deep, entirely carved out of the rock and roughly square; two walls are perfectly smooth, while the other two, and in part also the bottom, have a rough surface. The portion of rock in which pit 1 has been dug does not have a levelled surface as in the room 1 area but is oblique and rough. The stratigraphic connection with the room 1 area has been destroyed by the erosion of layer ?, so that it is impossible to relate the pit to the structures uphill. The situation is different in the southeast part of the trench where the rock slopes sharply with an almost vertical drop of about 3 m. (figs. 7, 8). One after the other walls d, c and a (figs. 6, 56) were placed on this vertical step. The wall a rests directly on the rock; it is 2.60 m. long, 0.50 m. wide and runs east-west. At the eastern end it merges with the rock which virtually reaches the present surface; near the western extremity it ends in a door in the vicinity of pit 1. The maximum height to which the wall has been preserved is 0.50 m. near the door post. The wall is made of large irregularly shaped stones arranged random fashion but with the flat surfaces facing outwards. It is strati graphically correlatable with layer ? alone which has covered it completely and carried away most of the upper part. To the southeast lies a zone in which, because of the depth of the rock a consider? able amount of deposit has accumulated (fig. 7). In the stratigraphy of this zone of trench F (fig. 7) a few centimetres from the rock (25) The fauna finds from the 1974 excavation campaign have been temporarily imported into Italy with the kind permission of the Dept. of Archaeology of Pakistan and are being studied by Dr B.

Trench F; stratigraphic section X-X\ 166</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 8 - Aligr?ma. Trench F; section Y-Y*. bottom there are traces of a floor, ?a, rich in ashes, charcoal and potsherds. On one section of this floor lies a large baked-clay vessel, partially visible in the plan (figs. 6, 58) as at least 2/3 of it lie beyond the southeast boundary of the trench. This vessel was in all probability used as a hearth and contained a large nucleus of ashes and charcoal. It had been made of hand-modelled clay later baked by occasional fire and laid partly over small schist slabs (28). Corresponding to layer ? is the base of wall d laid on a step in the rock which was probably cut artificially. After a very short stretch in which the rock surface is level with the southeast front of wall d, it bends considerably until it becomes almost horizontal and forms the base of the deposit. Like layer ?, layer ? is lacking in rubble and is made up of a dark clay sediment. Partially underlying wall c is d (fig. 57), entirely supported by the rock both at its base and on the northwest side. Towards the southwest it continues beyond the trench boundary, while it is supported by the rock gradient towards the NE. The part of it that has been unearthed is 2.35 m. long, 0.60 m. wide and has a maximum height of 1.30 m. It is built of average size stones carefully arranged and embedded in yellowish clay mortar. The peculiar feature of the wall's construction is the fact that its surface was finished off after it had been completely erected. On the floor related to its construction phase, i.e. ?a, which is made of the mortar described above, stone chips were found that had been produced by finishing operations carried out on the visible surface of the wall. (28) After the 1975 excavation campaign during which the excavated area of trench F was extended, layers (2) - (3) were found to be two successive fillings behind a long wall running N-S having a containment function. Besides, floor (5)a with the slabs and hearth were part of a large room extending to the E for several metres and com? pletely excavated in November 1975. 167</page><page sequence="18">Lying above wall d is wall c (fig. 57) which forms a right angle, as it is divided into two sections: one running NE resting on the rock gradient, and the other SW extending beyond the trench boundary. The maximum height to which it has been preserved is 0.90 m. near the edge of the corner. The footing of the wall is very carefully made; it consists of average-size stones regularly arranged one next to the other, with care being taken to leave only a few small empty spaces which were then filled with chips or small stones. The corner is also provided with a rectangular schist slab (0.70 m. X 0.40 m.) laid horizontally about 0.40 m. away from the base of the wall. Layer @ reaches about two thirds of the way up wall c on the outside, while layer ?? reaches almost all the way up on the inside. On the outside, the very thin floor ?a is composed of a very fine clay deposit lacking in rubble and resembling the mortar used in the construction of c. This is thus the floor connected with the construction phase of the wall under which lies layer ?, much darker in colour and with less rubble than ? although it is also of alluvial origin. Finds The majority of finds consisted of pottery while, because of the limited area of the excavation, the small quantities of other classes of materials have comparatively little importance. Pottery As we shall see at the end of the present study, trench F revealed the presence of a chronologically limited sequence and offers an assortment of pottery which is limited both typologically and chronologically. Nevertheless, room 1, described in the previous chap? ter, with its floors yielding numerous finds, offered a comparatively complete variety of types within the framework of our knowledge of Period VI of the Sw?t chronological sequence and of the range of domestic use of ceramic artifacts, thereby adding to the initial picture obtained from the results of the 1966-1973 excavation campaigns (29). Besides the dis? covery, in the lower part of the trench, of even a very limited stratigraphic sequence re? veals interesting typological and chronological variations in spite of the restrictions imposed by the small area excavated to a greater depth. The typological classification used in the treatment which follows is the one normally used so far in studying pre- and protohistoric evidence in Sw?t as published in the report by Silvi and Stacul on the graveyards (30). Although this classification is based on evidence (29) For the chronological sequence of the Sw?t Valley see G. Stacul, ?Preliminary Report on the Pre-Buddhist Necropolises in Sw?t (W. Pakistan) ?, EWy XVI, 1966, pp. 37-79; Id., ? Ex? cavation near Gh?ligai... ?, cit. For the data relevant to the 1966 and 1973 excavation campaigns, see note 2. (30) Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op. cit. 168</page><page sequence="19">which is particular, i.e. that of one or more graveyards, no great qualitative differences were noted such as to warrant the revision or updating of the existing lists, even though some differences may come to light in the course of the present work. At the present state of work on the settlements it is my view that there is not even any need to change the criteria on which the Silvi-Stacul typology is based, although they are of a morpho? logical-empirical nature rather than analytical as is now the custom in modern pottery classi? fication studies (31). This will become necessary, and possible, when research work is ex? tended and thus also the material culture complexes at our disposal are more substantial and rigid typometric criteria will be required to show up typological changes. Layers (5) - ?a contain vases such as the bell-shaped type (32), which were unknown in the late Period VI and are a direct continuation of typical Period V specimens. Also the stemmed bowl is present with thicker stems, which is in contrast with the tendency towards slenderness found in later periods. Although the surface of the vases is sometimes light grey, most of the vases in these layers are dark grey or even black in colour, while the amount of red ware is increasing. These features are more noticeable in layers ? and ?a and there are indications of greater age as proved by the presence of "classical'5 Period V types, e.g. the bell-shaped vessel with large mouth and concave sides, carinated in the lower part of the body, and disk-base (33) (fig. 16 k), although represented only by a small fragment; or the stemmed bowl in red ware (34) (fig. 16 j) with a thick stem and decorated with grooves. Most of the vases have disk-bases which are much higher than later types, e.g. in the vase with deep body, large mouth, vertical rim and horizontal grooves on the body (fig. 16 g) (35), in which, besides the base, also the form and the shiny black colouring are evidence of a close connection with Period V. Of interest is the presence of the narrow-mouthed globular bottle with high neck, flared rim and flat base (fig. 16 h) (36) in red ware, whose association in the graves is unfortunately unknown (37). However, there seems to be no doubt that it is an object belonging to Period V in view of its certain derivation through miniaturization from the globular, narrow-mouthed jar with high, slightly flaring rim and disk-base (38) found in typical funeral furnishings of the period. Besides, although it is purely indicative, it is interesting to note a close analogy between the shape described and that of a vase from Burzahom of unknown stratigraphic context and dating (39). Comparatively more frequent with respect to later levels is the presence of fragments of brown thin-sided ware, mostly relating to the globular, large-mouthed vase with almost (31) AO.

As in the specimen illustrated (fig. 16 i), the latter occasion? ally displays an incised decoration consisting of a series of horizontal and wavy line grooves. Also very frequent is the same type of vase, smaller in size and with often very thin sides in Grey and Black Ware (fig. 16 1). The presence of small vases and of comparatively light-coloured grey paste, together with a few vase shapes that continue into the next period and a small number of specimens that can really be compared with the early Period V, situate the horizon described in a later phase of this period and thus give the trench F sequence a continuous, uninterrupted character. Beginning the analysis of pottery finds from layer ? it must be pointed out that, as it is of alluvial origin, it contains, mixed with the rubble washed down the hillside, pot? sherds lacking all chronological homogeneity with specimens from different periods lying side by side. The underlying layers ?a, ?b and @c, on the other hand, contain finds belonging to Period VI of the Swat chronological sequence and, in particular, to an advanced stage of its development as is demonstrated by stratigraphical and typological factors that will be dealt with further on. The pottery from these levels can be divided into the following seven classes: ? Red Thin-sided Ware and Grey Thin-sided Ware, which account for the majority of finds (about 70%), while the others are present in smaller percentages; ? Red Thin-sided Ware, slipped or polished; ? Red Thick-sided Ware; ? Brown Thin-sided Ware; ? Black Thin-sided Ware. Typologically speaking the most common shape is the pear-shaped beaker with flared rim and flat base (41); in the specimen illustrated (fig. 16 b), it displays two series of grooves, one near the neck and the other slightly above the point of maximum expansion of the body where, at regular intervals, there are six V-shaped motifs pointing alternately with dots inside. All the specimens of this type are in grey thin-sided ware with varying degrees of lightness. The lighter colours predominate as they are typical of this advanced stage of Period VI. In addition to the incised decoration illustrated, almost all the beakers described display a variety of incised motifs (42). One peculiarity found for the first time is the presence of a variant form with trilobate rim attested by two frag? ments. The vase with deep body, flared rim and flat or disk-base (43), whose paste resembles (40) Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op. cit., type VT14. (41) Ibid., type VT38t (42) For a representative survey of incised decorative motifs see ibid., pp. 47-55. (43) Ibid., type VT20. 170</page><page sequence="21">that of the beakers described, is also very common. The example illustrated (fig. 16 c) has two grooves on the neck and four zigzag motifs incised at the point of maximum expan? sion of the body. Less frequent is the cup with incurved rim (44), in dark red, and less frequently, grey paste, of which the grey specimen illustrated (fig. 16 e) displays two grooves under the rim. Then there is the large-mouthed, globular vase with almost vertical rim (45) (fig. 16 1). Although its lower part is missing it may have had a stem or pedestal. It is almost always of grey paste and decorated with deep grooves or cordons all over the upper part of the body. There is a considerable number of large vases, all fragmentary, in coarse red paste, usually not very highly purified or uniformly baked. The wide-mouthed vases with almost vertical rim and curved bottom (fig. 16 a), usually decorated with one or more cordons below the rim and ear-shaped handles, have a rough and often porous surface. The large vases often include the globular, narrow-mouthed jars with out-turned rim and disk-base (fig. 16 d) (46). The paste used is not very coarse and the surface is generally slipped and polished (47) and the upper part of the body is decorated with groups of horizontal or wavy line grooves. The pottery from the layers ?? to ?a below reveals a gradual typological develop? ment attesting a transition period going from immediately after, or being contemporary with, the end of Period V to an early Period VI preceding the mature VI already de? scribed. This development is attested only by the appearance of certain types or typo? logical elements known to be characteristic of a definite horizon in other exacavations, especially in the graveyards. Because of the small size of the area excavated it has not been possible to check these observations out with quantitatively and qualitatively more extensive evidence. The numerous incised potsherds found in layers ?a, ?b and ?c, usually with a linear decoration of the type already discussed (48), include some bearing motifs seen here for the first time, e.g. two Grey Ware fragments (fig. 66) from layer ?a one of which (the one on the left in the illustration) displays a series of four parallel zigzag grooves with the peculiarity of having three dots incised near one corner, while the other (on the right) displays two groups of three parallel segments opposite an oblique segment. One factor that seems to be becoming more and more typical of the Aligr?ma settle? ment is the large quantity of miniature vases found. Although this is partly due to the greater probability a small object has of remaining intact for thousands of years with respect to a larger one, this class of materials has now been proved to have played an important (44) Ibid., type VT10. (45) Ibid., type VT14. (46) Ibid., type VT71. (47) During the 1975 excavation campaign at Aligr?ma, careful analysis of the surface of similar vases showed that very often only the upper part of the vase (about 1/3) has a slipped and polished surface, while the remainder is gritty. This phenomenon is related to the position occupied by the vases in the dwellings; 3/4 of their surface area was buried beneath floor level. (48) See note 5. 171</page><page sequence="22">role in the life of the settlement and to a lesser extent in funeral ritual (49). As well as being qualitatively more extensive, the evidence offered by the settlement is also qualitat? ively different, as a number of forms have not been found in grave furnishings. Common among the known types is the small globular cup on a pedestal with vertical or flaring rim (fig. 17 c, d, t) (50). Usually of red paste, this vase was used over a long period as is demonstrated in our trench by a specimen from layer ? (fig. 17 t) and by others from layers ?a, ?b and ?c (fig. 17 c, d). It is immediately apparent how the base is wider in the earlier specimen and tends to be smaller in the other one (51). Another very common type in the earlier periods of our sequence is the small bell-shaped vase with rim corresponding to maximum diameter and flat base (fig. 17 g, h, i, u, v) (52). Also this type of vase has a long chronological existence which follows entirely the life of its proto? type (53), i.e. from Period V to Period VI. In the group of miniature vases, this type is relatively more frequent in earlier periods, when it was often decorated with cordons (fig. 17 u) and has a very sharp-edged base. In more recent periods the base may form an obtuse angle with the lower part of the vase which thus takes on a rounded appearance (fig. 17 i). More restricted in time, i.e. to a final phase of Period VI and perhaps also of VII, is the small bowl with out-turned rim and flat base (fig. 17 j, k) (54). One of the two specimens illustrated (fig. 17 j), because of its doubtful stratigraphic context (i.e. layer ?) and certain morphological details, seems to be more recent (55). Typical of Period VI is the small globular vase with flaring rim and flat or disk-base (56), usually of red paste (fig. 17 e, o, p). It has a wide range of variants and, at the beginning of its development, it may have a more expanded body and grey-black paste (fig. 17 n). The small cylindrical vase with flat base (5?), always of grey paste, is found only in contexts dating back to Period V or the transition to VI (fig. 17 s). In addition to the range of miniature vases already known from the graveyards and already attested in Aligr?ma too (58) there are a few miniature bowls in red or brown paste (fig. 17 a, b, 1, r), very common in middle and late Period VI, a few miniature vases with flaring sides and flat base (fig. 17 q), and bowls with stem or pedestal (fig. 17 1, m) of grey paste, found only in middle and late Period VI. With respect to the previous campaigns no new element has been added to our (49) Nothing can be stated as yet about their function as the results of water flotation of their soil content have been negative.

(55) A more recent dating for this object is supported also by a number of comparisons with material from Ch?rsadda. Wheeler, op. cit., fig. 48, no. 512, p. 99 (Ch IV well E; 2nd century B.C.).

All the types have been reconfirmed as well as their chrono? logical position. The new data consist of the evidence concerning the final phase of Period V where only a small number of miniature vase finds has been made, moreover consisting only of a few types. On the strength of the evidence from trench E, where the sequence begins in earlier periods, it may be said that it is actually in the final phase of Period V that the miniature vases begin to appear in small numbers. Also confirmed is the extensive spread of this class of objects in middle and late Period VI. Whatever the causes of this development, there is no doubt that they are related to the variations in a number of productive factors as it is now obvious that the miniature vases had a role linked to pro? duction and were not just children's toys (59). Terracotta Of interest because it was the first specimen of its kind found is a terracotta toy wheel (fig. 59) with a central hole, modelled by hand in brown paste. A number of humped bull figurines, unknown in the graveyards, have been found in the settlement (fig. 61). The hand modelling of the red or brown clay often reveals the pains taken to represent accurately certain anatomical details perhaps connected with the representation of the male animal. Almost all the male figurines have, in fact, the head with horns, open mouth and impressed circles to indicate the nostrils and eyes (fig. 60). This is almost certainly related to another fragment (fig. 62) of the rear of the animal where, in addition to the tail surrounded by a ring of small impressed circles perhaps in? dicating the trappings, two clay globules have been applied between the legs to represent the testicles. The only anthropomorphic figurine (fig. 63), whose sex cannot be ascertained as it is fragmentary, was found in layer ?c. It has a flat body, with no particular anatomical features, in which three highly schematic pointed appendages represent the head and arms. There are numerous spindle-whorls of different shapes and sizes. They are all convex or biconical in outline (figs. 64, 65) (60), never beehive-shaped. This is because the bee? hive-shaped spindle-whorl is found in Period VII, i.e. in a period in which this object was in full expansion in northwest India. Stone Grindstones, generally of the saddle-quern type, are very frequent in various parts of the settlement. A few specimens have been found in trench F (fig. 67) made of granite (59) Although I consider interesting the hy? pothesis advanced by Prof. Farid Khan of the University of Peshawar during a visit he made to our excavations that these objects were used as weights, I do not think it is a plausible one at the present state of our knowledge because of the absence in our repertory of a continuous and complete series of increasing weights and measures.

From room 1 comes a schist slab with a hole; this has already been described and it seems that it had definite "ritual" characteristics that are still not fully understood owing to the fact that these objects have frequently been found on the dwelling floors without any apparent function and also to their connection with the anthropomorphic motifs on the cinerary urns based on the regular pattern of several holes (61). Metalwork Only three metal objects come from trench F, probably made of copper (62). One of them, a rectangular rod, with sharpened and flattened ends (fig. 68) has no precedent in the complexes excavated. It could conceivably be a double-ended chisel, although in this case it is hard to see how the object could be used as one of the two ends would have been flattened by the hammering action used to transmit the blow to the object being worked. The lack of traces of percussion could be explained by the fact that the object had a handle or by its being put to a special use whereby percussion took place using a soft body such as wood. A small, well preserved nail, round in section, has also been found. It has an un? usually shaped head ? a cone whose pointed part, instead of forming the upper tip, is inserted into the body of the object so as to form a constriction (fig. 69). Lastly, there is a large pin, round in section, with a globule surmounted by a disk head (63), with no decoration of any kind (fig. 70). * * * At the present state of our knowledge, the area whose cultural characteristics most closely resemble those of protohistoric Sw?t is that of Dir. Recent excavations by the Department of Archaeology of the University of Peshawar (64) have unearthed part of a settlement and a graveyard, where the material displays very close analogies and typological links with that found in the numerous protohistoric excavations in Swat. The cultural af? finity of the two areas is confirmed also by a pronounced environmental affinity, as the two valleys have similar orographic and hydrographic characteristics, are only a short dis? tance apart and run in the same direction. (61) Stacul, Tusa, op. cit., p. 319. (62) No analysis has been made of the compo? sition of these objects. However, as they are contemporary with and similar to others found in the graveyards and analysed, they are thought, by analogy, to consist almost entirely of copper. In this connection see, Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op. cit., p. 5. (63) Ibid., type OM6. (64) A.H.

The criteria on which the study and the arrangement of the material from the graveyard of Timargarha are based differ from those we have used. The distinction between cultural horizons based on the pos? tulated sequence of three separate and successive funeral rituals (inhumation, cremation and fractional burial) and only supported by scanty and sectoral stratigraphic data, does not possess the same characteristics as our classification which takes account of precise strati graphic data and gives us the certainty that different funeral rites existed side by side. This "contradiction1' affects the classification and organization of the artifacts and gives rise to considerable chronological and associative disagreement. The initial assumption, put into practice in the study of the graveyard, leads to the classification of the material from the Balambat settlement, lying only a short distance from Timargarha. The assignment of the graves lying at the base of the settlement deposit to Period II determines the dating of the next two construction phases as Periods III and IV. In connection with our typo? logical sequence, both for the reasons explained previously and because of the possible mingling of finds from different layers, this leads to considerable inconsistencies. Ma? terial assigned to Period III at Dir is, in my opinion, more recent by several centuries as is attested by the Ch?rsadda (65) and Aligr?ma (66) excavations. Furthermore, among the material of unquestioned "grave culture" origin, there is also an association of elements that our evidence seems to indicate as being separate and belonging to different cultural horizons. The evidence from Timargarha and Balambat is thus extremely interesting as it proves the existence in protohistoric times of a close link between the two neighbouring valleys which makes it legitimate to hypothesize the presence of a "cultural province" which, in spite of local variations, is relatively homogeneous and, on the strength of available data, seems to stretch as far as the Buner and the Indus to the east (67) and as far as the Bajaur to the west (68). Any chronological comparison between the Dir horizons and those of Sw?t would, on (65) Wheeler, op. cit. Of those illustrated these materials are: Dani (ed.), op. cit., pp. 262 68, fig. 52, no. 30; fig. 53, no. 9; fig. 55, no. 16 (from BBT, Northern zone, layer @). (66) For the same material see the report on trench K, which follows. (67) G. Stacul, ?Discovery of Four Pre Buddhist Cemeteries near P?cha in Buner (Sw?t, W.

(68) Dani (ed.), op. cit., pp. 233 f. (Enayet Qila). Of course with the inevitable chronological differentiations this cultural horizon takes in the mountainous zones of Sw?t (Sw?t Kohist?n), as is proved by the finds from K?l?m and Kherai: G. Stacul, ?An Archaeological Survey near K?l?m (Sw?t Kohist?n) ?, EW, XX, 1970, pp. 87 91; Id., ? Notes on the Discovery... ?, cit. Further north there is also the settlement of Utrot discovered by G.

On the banks of the lower reaches of the river Sw?t lies an important settlement: Damk?t. Its strategic importance is determined by the possibility afforded of easy com? munications between the two valleys through a natural route passing through this point, and crossing the Talash valley to reach Dir and Chitral further north. The strategic interest of the site was always present as is proved by the nearby fort of Chak dara built by the British in 1896. The material complex from the lower layers of the settlement, assigned to Period I in the sequence drawn up by the author of the report (70), concerns us directly as it con? tains a number of elements that can be related back to the trench F evidence. The pitcher in Red Ware with long neck and deep external grooves and black core (71), and the bowl on stand with solid stem (72) are, in particular, objects that are extremely typical of the period lying between V and VI in the Sw?t cultural sequence and present in trench F in layers &lt;3) - ?a. While this correlation confirms the dating proposed for Damk?t Period I as the first half of the 1st millennium, although its small area cannot be con? sidered representative, it does not agree with the rest of the typological complex of Dam? k?t I. In my opinion, except for a few objects, including those mentioned earlier, which can be assigned to Sw?t Period V-VI, most of them are to be attributed to Period IV (Gh?ligai ?, Loebanr III) for a number of reasons, e.g. the type of mat-impression and black-burnishing as well as the peculiarity of certain forms (73). Others, on the other hand, display characteristics (see the rims of large jars and vases) that can be found in the Ch?rsadda levels dated as 3rd - 1st century B.C. (74). As can be inferred from certain considerations regarding later materials from trench K at Aligr?ma, the material complex at Damk?t I, on the strength of our evidence, belongs to chronological times that are quite far apart, ranging from the beginning of the 2nd millennium (Gh?ligai ?, Loebanr III) to the 3rd - 2nd century B.C., i.e. the time of the Maurya expansion (75). Moving even further south it is possible to establish the present-day boundaries of this "cultural province" as coinciding with the northernmost reaches of the alluvial plains, i.e. the Peshawar area. From two settlements lying only a few miles from the important (e9) A recent survey of research in the area is that of G.F. Dales, ?

At Ch?rsadda (Ch I, 50, 47-43, 39; Ch III A, 10) Wheeler noted the presence of a "Soapy Red Ware" with shapes and characteristics comparable with those of the proto historic cultures found further north, which he dated as 550-300 B.C. as, having found iron in association, he related it to the period of Achaemenian expansion (76). Although the typological characterization and the relative chronology remain valid, the absolute dating of this pottery class and the layers containing it must be placed earlier as a result of recent discoveries and absolute datings in Sw?t (7?). Lastly, the graveyard of Zarif Kor?na has provided a complex of graves and material which, besides being further evidence of the southward spread of this culture, also makes it possible for this area to be characterized locally and differentiated from that of the mountains on the strength of the greater abundance of Red Ware compared with Grey Ware, although the shapes remain more or less the same (78). In order to conclude these brief comparative notes, it is significant that the horizon expressed in trench F should belong to a widespread cultural "koine", the boundaries of which have been briefly outlined. What is missing at the present state of research in this part of the world is the possibility of making this picture a dynamic one by carrying out a few chronological distinctions. Apart from Sw?t, which has its own precise typological and cultural sequence, further confirmed by the Aligr?ma excavations, the other areas have no valid comparative schemes because of the contradictions that, in my opinion, affect the overall chronological and typological pictures. Only Ch?rsadda, which shows a clear chrono? logical and typological distinction between the "Soapy Red Ware" and the later "historical" pottery is of any real help as a relative chronology. It is our hope that the publication of the Zarif Kor?na graveyard will provide useful elements for the elaboration of a com? parative chronology of the various northwest areas (79). Trench K Continuing the exploration of the Aligr?ma area for the purpose of investigating the size of the settlement and the factors involved in its territorial expansion, it was decided (76) Wheeler, op. cit., p. 39. (77) For the absolute datings obtained using the C-14 method see Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op. cit., p. 4, note 2. (78) M.R. Mughal, ?A Summary of Exca? vations and Explorations in Pakistan (1971 and 1972)?, PkA, 8, 1972, pp. 125 f. From a cursory examination of the Zarif Kor?na material, for which I should like to thank Mr Gulzar Khan of the Archaeological Dept. of Pakistan, it would seem that Red Ware is more abundant than Grey Ware. Furthermore, a careful analysis ought also to be made of the relation between this pottery and the "Soapy Red Ware"' from Ch?rsadda, as it seems to me that the Zarif Kor?na Red Ware corresponds to the description given by Wheeler of this class of pottery (Wheeler, op. cit., p. 39). (79) That it is impossible at the present state of our knowledge to work out a comparative chronological pattern is clear from Dales' work in which he merely lists local sequences without attempting any synthesis (Dales, op. cit.). 177</page><page sequence="28">to dig an explorative trench at the top of the hill. From this position, i.e. about 100 m. above the underlying valley, not only does one dominate the low-lying area of the settle? ment where trenches A, B, C, D and E have been dug but one also has an excellent view of a large part of the central Sw?t Valley from Barikot to the south up to Mangl?or to the north, over a distance of about 20 km. (fig. 71). To the east one overlooks the tributary valley of the Gujanb?r khwar as far as its source in the mountain chain dividing, in a north-south direction, Dir to the west from Sw?t to the east. Today there is a tiny plateau on the top of the hill, almost circular in shape and nearly horizontal, with a diameter of about 20 m. (fig. 72). The sides of this plateau have a gradient of about 1:3 down to the valley bottom on the southeast and on the other sides slope down to undulating platforms lying about 20 m. further down. On the west side, the latter are quite large and form a saddle with the nearby mountains, which are much higher and, further to the north, skirt the right flank ot the Sw?t Valley. The occupation in different periods of the Aligr?ma hill is attested by numerous masonry remains visible on the surface as well as by large quantities of surface potsherds. A few pottery fragments and perhaps also some of the architectural remains belonging to Period V and VI of the protohistoric sequence of the Sw?t Valley attest to an occupation also in these earlier periods. Trench K is 9.50 m. long, 3 m. wide and is aligned in a north-south direction. It is situated on the northern boundary of the Aligr?ma hilltop plateau and cuts into a part of its edge in a centripetal direction. The northern boundary is thus not so clearly defined as the southern one because, as it is situated near the slope, it runs between several architectural structures lying near the surface, which have been eroded and covered with a very thin layer of soil and rubble. In order to clarify the position of the structures found in the trench all the structures on the surface near its boundaries were cleaned, especially towards the north where among other things the layers and walls unearthed are heavily eroded in the vicinity of the hillside. In the northern part of the trench (fig. 9), in the area denominated area 1, at the base of the stratigraphic sequence (fig. 10) is layer ?, yellow and dusty and partly covering the rock at the bottom of the trench. In this layer at the centre of area 1 a pit had been dug. It had no stone lining but there were a few stones lying near the mouth. As already mentioned, at the base of layer ?, the bedrock seems to have been flattened horizontally in the southern part of area 1 while it gradually slopes downwards to the north and its surface becomes rougher and rougher. Between the rock and layer @, in a few places, there are traces of thin layers, often only a few millimetres thick, the first of which touches the rock and is reddish in colour. It is formed by the crumbling of the rock itself. The one above it is a whitish, very compact floor belonging to wall c and corresponding to the earthen floor ?a in area 2. Above ? lie layers ?, ?a and ?b of which ?, whitish, dusty and rich in ash and charcoal, partially covers the storage pits 1 and 2 situated between it and the underlying ?a and ?b (fig. 10).

Trench K; section A-A\ two pits are partially visible in the plan as pit 1 is half under wall b and pit 2 is almost completely beneath the east side of the trench. Their construction techniques and charac? teristics are already known from previous excavations at Aligr?ma, although, because of their small size, they are more closely paralleled only by two analogous pits in trenches D and E situated in levels corresponding to an occupation period contemporary with that of Maurya. As we shall see, this corresponds to the chronological assignment of our two specimens. They consist of a single thickness of medium-size stones lying along the wall, with no traces of mortar. Pit 1 seems to have narrowed at a certain height as instead of one thickness there seems to have been two parallel rows of stones. While the width has not changed in the course of time (pit 1: 1.20 m., pit 2: 1.50 m.) the same cannot be said of the height which may have undergone some modification (pit 1: 0.50 m., pit 2: 0.40 m.) (fig. 73). Layer 0 attests a long period of soil accumulation on top of the architectural re? mains belonging to the floor 0a. This interruption of site occupation can also be ob? served in the substantial difference existing between the masonry techniques used in the two horizons ? the upper one (layers ? - @a) and the lower one (layer 0 - ?a) as well as in the characteristics of the material culture complexes, which seem to be about one century apart (the 1st century B.C.) (80). At the base of layer 0 there is floor 0a (fig. 10). It is very thin and rich in ashes and charcoal and is connected to the two pits described and wall c under wall c9 (fig. 10). Wall c has been partially unearthed as a result of its peculiar position. It is built of medium-size stones arranged untidily and unsymmetrically and held together (80) On the strength of numerous considerations and comparisons, mainly with the Ch?rsadda sequence (Wheeler, op. cit.), layers ? - (5)a at Aligr?ma (trench K) can be seen to lie between the 1st and the 4th century A.D., while layers @ - ?a belong to 4th - 2nd century B.C. 180</page><page sequence="31">by a yellowish-coloured mortar. It is built directly onto the bedrock as is the wall in area 2 which resembles it in the technique used (81). In the vicinity of the southwest corner of area 1, partially covered by the base of wall by a red, narrow-mouthed jar with ellipsoidal outline, high vertical rim and curved bottom was found in situ (figs. 18a, 74, 75). It had been placed below floor ?a with its mouth projecting slightly above it, and was closed by a polished discoidal stone lid so as to form a fixed container. Layer ?b resembles @, although it is a little lighter in colour and less rich in organic matter and potsherds. Inserted in it up to about half their present height are the two pits described above and the large bluish granite stone the upper surface of which is perfectly flat and horizontal and was laid flush with the floor ?a connected to the two pits and wall c. Although the upper surface of the stone described shows no traces of wear, it was probably used as a working surface for an activity that is still unknown at the present state of our knowledge. Continuing the description of the stratigraphic sequence (fig. 10) of area 1 we next come to layers ?? and ?a. The former, brown coloured and dusty, was cut by the foundations of walls a, b and c\ At the base of this layer lies ?a, a very thin whitish floor, which is supported by wall h to the north, of which only one row of stones remains, while to the south it passes under the base of wall a and continues into the adjoining area 2. Here, as we shall see, it is supported by wall e. Wall h was partly destroyed during the construction of c\ For this reason it is visible only in the vicinity of the east side of the trench and outside the latter, towards the east, where it curves to the southeast. Above the layers and structures described a room has been partially unearthed. It is bounded on three sides by walls a (to the south), b (to the west) and c} (to the north) (figs. 9, 76, 77). Walls a and c' are perfectly parallel and are cut perpendicularly by b so that the room perimeter is perfectly regular in the part that has been excavated. The masonry may be assigned to the "diaper" type found in various places in the north? west area of the sub-continent starting from the 1st century A.D. side by side with the preceding '"rubble masonry" (fig. 78) (82). The extremely accurate foundation structure of walls a and b is perfectly well known. It consists of a row of large, irregular and untidily laid stones over which is placed neatly a series of superimposed slab-like stones. The wall itself is laid on this at a distance of about 0.20 m. from the edge. Wall a is 1.10 m. wide at the base and 0.90 m. in the visible section, while b is 1.20 m. and 1.00 m. wide, respectively (figs. 9, 79). Wall c\ because of its position on the steep slope, has a different structure and is much less well preserved. It is built on the remains of the fallen wall c underneath and partly on the earth deposits of the preceding levels (fig. (81) These walls belonging to the lower levels of trench K were built using the "rubble masonry" technique in use at Aligr?ma ever since the proto historic period and found in numerous other contemporary sites, of which the one providing the richest evidence is Bhir Mound (Sir J. Marshall, Taxila, Cambridge, 1951, pp. 87-111). (82) Marshall, op. cit., pp. 137 f. 181</page><page sequence="32">10). The base of its northern face thus lies about 1.20 m. below the base of the south? ern face. It is 1.10 m. wide and 4 m. long. It has been destroyed by erosion to the east (figs. 10, 80). The stratigraphy of these structures is clear on the south side of the room, while towards the east the layers have been eroded and contact with the walls has thus been lost. Under a layer of humus about 0.20 m. thick lies layer ?. It is white, dusty, about 0. 30 m. thick and contains the collapsed walls of the room described. At the base of ?, between it and @b, there is a very thin floor, ?a, connected to walls a, b and c\ in which numerous potsherds have been found. While the connection of this floor with walls a and b is quite clear, as it lies just above their bases, that with wall c9 has been lost due to erosion. Beneath floor ?a (fig. 10) lies ?b, whitish, rich in rubble and yellowish mortar used in the construction of the above walls. In conclusion, the layers described are connected with the destruction (?, ?), the utilization (?a) and the construction of walls a, b and c} (?b). In the southern part of trench K (fig. 9), called area 2, the stratigraphic situation (fig. 10) is basically homogeneous compared with that of area 1, from the top down to layer ?a. Further below, several layers in area 1 correspond to a single layer in area 2, 1. e. ?, which is easily located as it lies between analogous levels in both areas ? ?a above and ?a in area 1 which is probably similar to ?a in area 2 below. The sequence ?&gt; ?a, ?b and ? in area 1 thus corresponds to layer ? in area 2. This phenomenon obviously presupposes the presence of a structure under walls a and d which, by separating the two areas, gave rise to different forms of accumulation. At the base of the trench, the rock, which has a greater absolute height than in area 1, has a rough and much divided surface; a small channel and a little well covered with a schist slab have been carved out of it (figs. 11, 81). Also in contact with the rock are the edges of a floor that is similar to and contemporary with ?a in area 1, i.e. ?a. The latter is covered by ?, and is yellowish, compact and rich in rubble. Above this (fig. 10) lie layers ? and ?a. ? is very compact and white and covers the wall, while ?a lies underneath in connection with it and represents the continuation of ?a in area 1. Wall e, preserved up to a height of 1.40 m., and more than 1.20 m. wide, is built directly on the rock using a construction technique similar to that of wall cy with which it is partly contemporary; it continues to be used later as is attested by the connection to floor ?a supported by wall h which is more recent than c (figs. 11, 81). Beside this wall and belonging to floor ?a and slightly higher than it there is a large granite stone resembling the one already described in area 1, almost completely buried in the underlying layer ? (fig. 11). Above all this, below a thin humus layer, lie layers ?, ?a and ?b (fig. 10). Layer ?, white and dusty, corresponds to ? in area 1 and covers ?a which is a floor connected to wall d. The latter has been destroyed towards the south by the action of a large root. Wall d, in a poor state of preservation, is contemporary with walls a, b and c\ although, as it is built almost on top of wall a, its construction must date 182</page><page sequence="33">to an immediately successive stage. Also its construction technique is similar and belongs to the "diaper masonry" type, although, unlike the others, it has no foundation structure. Layer ?b is basically the same as the corresponding layer in area 1 although it contains more rubble and is darker in colour. During the surface cleaning of the zone around trench K a number of very interesting masonry structures were unearthed (fig. 9). On the west and north sides, not only was a part of wall b and its junction with c} revealed (fig. 82) but another two walls were unearthed constructed in "diaper masonry" and which were probably utilized for the same period as walls a, b, c' and d. Wall / - f runs quite parallel to b - cy at a distance of only a few centimetres (figs. 9, 10). The part / is 0.90 m. wide, while /' cannot be defined since the southern face has not been preserved. The wall was built directly on the rock by means of a jutting base composed of large square blocks. To the west of / lies another wall, g, also built using the "diaper masonry" technique. It is angular, with one side pa? rallel to / and b and the other running on a line with c} in a westerly direction (fig. 9). It has a jutting base composed of slab-shaped medium-size stones arranged neatly. On the east side of the trench wall a has been found to continue for about 1.90 m. and the curved part of wall h, already described, has been unearthed (fig. 9). Finds On one hand, the examination of the movable finds from trench K does not modify or extend the archaeological picture of the period included between the 4th century B.C. and the 4th century A.D., which is well documented in this zone by the sites further south on the alluvial plains. On the other hand, however, it takes on a definite signifi? cance in that finds from this period (pottery and small finds) of Sw?t coming from regular excavations and associated with architectural remains, have not often been published (83). The pottery accounts for the bulk of the finds and resembles to a greater or lesser extent that of the nearby and distant sites in the North-West Frontier Province. However, very little attention has been paid to pottery during investigations so that today it is not possible to find any certain terms of reference as regards its typological and chronological de? velopment. In this particular case, the finding of a bronze coin in layer ? did not contribute as much as we had hoped to solving the problem of chronology, as its poor state of pre (83) Some contemporary material from levels with no architectural remains comes from Gh?? ligai, layers .(3) - ? (G. Stacul, ?Excavations in a Rock Shelter near Gh?ligai (Sw?t, W. Pakistan). Preliminary Report ?, EW, XVII, 1967, pp. 214-19; Id., ?Excavation near Gh?ligai...?, cit. Other similar material comes from numerous Sw?t sites such as Gogdara, Butkara, Udegr?m and B?r?ma, of which study is in progress. Also worthy of mention is the site of Damk?t (Abdur Rahman, op. cit.). 183</page><page sequence="34">servation has made it practically illegibile. It is possibly a coin of Kaniska I (128-151 A.D.) (84) or Vasudeva I (85) or types (fig. 83). Pottery The pottery found in trench K, almost all in a fragmentary state, consists entirely of Red Ware, except in the lower levels where fragments of Grey-Black Ware are found. The Red Ware varies from coarse to very fine and occasionally has a polished surface, de? pending on the characteristics of the artifact, which is always wheel-made. The Grey Black Ware is usually fine, also wheel-made, and unlike the Red Ware is always used for medium-size vases. As no complex of analogous artifacts already ordered and systematized was available and as the present evidence was too limited for a complete typological pattern to be worked out, the description of the materials partly follows the criteria and terminology used by Wheeler for his study of Ch?rsadda (8e). In my opinion, it is from this excavation that we have the richest and best documented pottery complex from the historical period of the North-West Frontier. In dealing with the earliest horizon of trench K, we shall examine the whole of the pottery finds from layers ? - ?a in area 1, which correspond to those of layers ? - ?a in area 2. The typological characteristics of the pottery from this horizon are quite different to those from the previously described later levels. What is missing are such typical elements as the jars with beaked and multi-grooved rims or bowls with clubbed rim, while other such elements are attested, e.g. the carinated bowls or dishes (fig. 19 c - g), from this period which, on the basis of a chronological coincidence, can be called Maurya, although the term is used without any historico-political connotations. This horizon contains a few fragments of Grey Ware; the type of paste used in the latter would assign them to the preceding period, i.e. Period VI of the Sw?t protohis toric sequence. Included among the more typical forms of this period are the small vase with bulging body, narrow mouth, low vertical rim and flat or disk-base (fig. 18 g) (87), a hollow stem (fig. 18 h) and the bowl of hemispherical shape mounted on a low stem and conical or disk pedestal (fig. 18 k) (88).

C87) Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op. cit., type VT15. (88) Ibid., type VT51. 184</page><page sequence="35">Period VI is of course an intrusion into the present Maurya horizon but can be explained also by the fact that, as can be seen from the architectural events of the lower layers, the first inhabitants of the Aligr?ma hill, during the Maurya period, either razed to the ground or at least badly damaged everything that existed previously, as can be seen from the small strips of floor found on the rock. Although the architectural structures of the proto historic period, if any, must have been small in number, there is no doubt that the hill was occupied in this period. This hypothesis, already made plausible by the discovery of sherds of protohistoric pottery in several places on the hill, is further supported by the finding of these fragments in layers at the beginning of the historical development of the Aligr?ma settlement. The more typical materials in this Maurya horizon include the following objects: ? jar of light red ware with ellipsoidal outline, high vertical rim and curved bottom. It had a flat river pebble as a lid (figs. 18 a, 74, 75) (89); ? bowl of red ware with flanged shoulder (fig. 18 b); ? jars of red ware with flanged rim (fig. 18 c); ? jars of red ware with everted rim (fig. 18 d-e); ? globular bowl of brown ware (fig. 18 f); ? Potsherd of red ware with cordon (fig. 18 i); ? miniature pot of fine red ware with carinated body and disk-base (fig. 18 j); ? large jar of brown ware with blunt, sharply everted rim and lines of crescent or finger-nail impressions on the shoulder (fig. 19 a); ? carinated bowls of red ware with clubbed rim (fig. 19 b); ? carinated bowls of grey ware (fig. 19 c); ? carinated bowls of red ware (fig. 19 d - g). A horizon with similar typological features is attested at Ch?rsadda in levels (37) - (21) (Ch I), dated as 4th - 2nd century B.C. This is confirmed by numerous analogies with the globular jar (figs. 18 a, 74, 75) (90), the jar with flanged shoulder (fig. 18 b) (91), the large jar with fingernail impressions (fig. 19 a) (92), the carinated bowl with clubbed rim (fig. 19 b) (93) and the simple carinated bowls (fig. 19 c - g) (94).

The carinated bowls are thus the most typical ceramic element of the period and are widespread over the northern part of India. It is because of their spread over this area and during the period related to the expansion of the Maurya empire that a number of scholars have defined them as the typical object par excellence of the Maurya era (97). Whatever its real relationship with this dynasty, its expansion into the Ganges basin is attested by numerous finds. At Kaus?mbi it is found in Period II 5-7, dated as 885 - 605 B.C. and, almost certainly, even later (98). Further east, in the Din?jpur district, at Banghar, they are assigned to the late Mauryan period (99). At Rupar it is attested in levels dated as 500 - 250 B.C. (10?). Although we are still far from knowing its exact chronological position and from understanding completely its formal development, I am convinced that it is a typical object, a guide specimen as it were, of the period between the 4th - 2nd century B.C. in the North-West Frontier Province. In our examination of the pottery from the upper horizon present in trench K we shall take an overall account of the evidence from layers ? - ?a, effecting the analysis layer by layer starting from the top. Layer ? contained a large quantity of fragments of large vases ? jars and bowls. It has not been possible to reconstruct their outlines completely, although the variability of their rims can be ascertained and this is of considerable diagnostic interest. The main types present are as follows: ? large clubbed-rim bowl, in red ware; the specimen illustrated has two rows of slanted segments incised below the rim (fig. 20 a); ? large flanged jars of red ware (fig. 20 b); ? jars of red ware with sharply recurved rim (fig. 20 c); ? jars of red ware with squared flanged or beaked rim (fig. 20 d - e); (95) Abdur Rahman, op. cit., p. 196, fig. 22, nos. 75, 76, from a context which, as was said in the report on trench F, seems to be composed of material from different periods. (96) Marshall, op. cit., p. 417, pi. 124, nos. 95, 96. What has been said is confirmed by the results of the recently resumed excavation of Bhir Mound where, in all four periods of the new periodization (4th - 1st century B.C.) carinated bowls are attested without any particular perceptible typological evolution (M. Sharif, ?Excavations at Bhir Mound Taxila?, PkA, 6, 1969, pp. 6-99). (97) As in the case of Y.D. Sharma who defines them as typical of central-western India between 700 and 100 B.C. (Y.D.

At Ch?rsadda, objects with similar or analogous characteristics are found in layers ? and ? of Ch I, dated as 1st - 4th century A.D., e.g. the flanged or beaked and grooved rims (fig. 20 d - g) (101). Besides being widespread in our zone, where they are present also at Taxila, they are also frequent outside as far as the Ganges basin, at Devnimori (102) and Amreli (103) where Polished Red Ware is well represented; the latter is known also in other sites in north India, and a few fragments come from Aligr?ma dated between 1st century B.C. and 5th century A.D. (104). The repertory from layers ? - @b is much richer and more varied. It contains large vases with which are associated a whole series of small bowls and a lamp (fig. 84). Some of the significant objects are: ? bowls in red paste with clubbed rim and cordons below it (fig. 20 k); ? pot handle of fine red ware with stamped floral motifs (figs. 20 1, 85); ? jars of red ware with rounded flanged rim (fig. 21 a - d); ? globular bowl of fine polished red ware, with grooves below the rim (fig. 21 e); ? large bowls of red ware with clubbed rim (fig. 211); ? carinated bowls of coarse red ware with clubbed rim and gritty curved bottom (figs. 21 g, 86); ? jars of red ware with squared flanged rim (fig. 21 h-i); ? conical bowls of red ware with clubbed rim (fig. 21 j - k); ?

At Rupar, in the Panjab, it is attested in Kushan levels (Sharma, op. cit., pp. 124-25, fig. 4). 187</page><page sequence="38">seems to have been a feature of Ch?rsadda in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. It exists in a wide range of variations, some of which are extremely flattened and others quite deep (105). The presence in this stratigraphic context which, as we shall see, is dated as 2nd - 4th century A.D., of an object that is so typical at Ch?rsadda of a period at least two centuries earlier is without doubt a contradiction that can be explained either by con? sidering our fragment to be an instrusion or as the expression of local persistence, which seems to be indicated also by the fact that its fabric is completely different. The question is best left open however until it can be tackled by evaluating and analysing the other evidence from Sw?t (106). The pot-handle (figs. 201, 85) with stamped floral motifs, which is typical of this and later periods, may be compared directly with a similar fragment from Ch?rsadda (107), dated however as 3rd century B.C. Nevertheless, the author himself, although justifying the early dating of the piece with a parallel find from Hastin?pura IV (108), asserts that this type of decoration is typical of the first few centuries A.D. Except for a few new additional elements due to the greater quantity of pottery found, the typological complex of these layers is similar to the preceding one. We thus have a continuation of those characteristics, e.g. the flanged or beaked rims, which we have seen to be common to a wide area, together with polished red ware, one specimen of which has been found in these layers (fig. 21 e). The complex of pottery finds from layers &lt;3) and (Da is much richer and varied. It also contains a few novelties which, although not substantially modifying the previous picture of this unitary horizon of the upper layers (? - &lt;3)a) of trench K, nevertheless adds to its repertory. The more representative types include: ? big jars of red ware with squared flanged rim (fig. 22 a - b); ? jars of red ware with rounded flanged rim (fig. 22 c - d); ? jars of red ware with squared flanged rim (fig. 22 e -1, p); ? dish of red ware with squared flanged rim with traces of gilt on the inside (fig. 22 g); ? hemispherical bowl of red ware with flanged rim and grooves on the body (figs. 22 h, 87); ? jars of red ware of various sizes with multi-grooved rims (figs. 22 i - n, 88); ? jar of red ware with flanged rim grooved inside (fig. 22 o); ? globular bowls of red ware (fig. 22 q); ? angular pedestal base of red ware (fig. 22 t); (105) Wheeler, op. cit.} pp. 38, 40, fig. 10, no. 11; p. 100, fig. 50, no. 549.

The series of jars with flanged or beaked rims already described is thus present and associated with them, with a similar rim, is the hemispherical bowl and the dish (figs. 22g-h, 87). However, the most characteristic element, both as regards its peculiarity and the quantities in which it is present, is the multi-grooved rim found in medium-size jars, of which, unfortunately, it has not been possible to reconstruct the outline entirely (figs. 22 i - m, 88), and in only one case in a very small jar (fig. 22 n). This type of rim is typical of Ch?rsadda, layers ? - ? of Ch I, and seems to have been particularly frequent between the 1st and the 2nd century A.D. (109). It is present also in a number of contemporary sites, e.g. Devnimori, in 2nd century A.D. levels (uo). The fragment of a miniature Grey Ware vase with a stamped impression on the bottom representing a floral motif with a few petals placed symmetrically like spokes in a wheel is unique (fig. 22 s). This motif, whose characteristics can be included among the floral representations of the period as shown in the sculpture has, to my knowledge, been found in a similar vase context only in the base of a Black-and-Red Ware dish from Arikamedu, in the pre-Aretine levels (Al = beginning of 1st century A.D.), in which an identical motif appears, although this time as a graffito after baking (m). The hemispherical bowls of Red Ware with clubbed rims and grooves below them (fig. 23 a - h) can be large and sometimes even small, but they all have a very fine paste which, in the case of the smaller vessels, allows the walls to be made very thin (fig. 23 e, g). Because of their association with materials that are typical of the first centuries of the Christian era, e.g. jar with multi-grooved rims, these bowls must be assigned to a dif? ferent chronological context to that of the Ch?rsadda and Tulamba material (112) which seems to be present in a period lying between the 3rd and the 2nd century B.C. This contradiction is hard to explain, but it is quite conceivable that, as in the case of other objects, it is due to dynamic phenomena in the expression of typological schemes the at? tested presence of which in the various sites thus takes on different chronological and associative characteristics.

One group (figs. 89, 91, 93) consists of small specimens of more careful workmanship, while the other group is made up of larger, more roughly made specimens (figs. 90, 92). In addition to the conical or biconical shaped spindle-whorl, the type with a collar on one side (fig. 91) is present in more recent layers in mixed contexts at Ch?rsadda, and in much later horizons at other sites, sometimes even later than ours (113). The conical shaped specimen (fig. 93) is particularly well known in other sites where it is found in similar chronological contexts (114). The other terracotta objects include a hollow conical object (fig.. 95) and an almost cylindrical bead with two grooves on the body and a hole in the middle (fig. 94). Stone In addition to a small number of fragments of grind- and mill-stones, made from large polished river pebbles, a series of small holed necklace beads or miscellaneous pen? dants have been found. Two similar beads were found in layer ?; they have a barrel shaped body and two opposed concavities and central hole. One of them is made of white stone (fig. 96) and the other of black stone (fig. 97). Also found in the same layer is another bead with flat discoidal body and central hole, made of white alabastrine stone (fig. 98). From the earliest horizon in trench K comes a globular cornelian bead (fig. 99). This form, always made of cornelian, is common in the earlier horizons of the historical and protohistoric sites as is inferred from the numerous specimens found at Aligr?ma in the preceding trenches and the graveyards (115). An interesting fragment of an object of an undefinable shape made of green schist has an incised geometric decoration of the type found on several spindle-whorls made of similar material and belonging to the Mauryan period (116) (fig. 100). Slate dishes with central hole (fig. 101) are frequent and found indifferently in all levels from the protohistoric period on. Lastly, a rather strange object has been found in layer ?. It consists of a long thin piece of very compact green schist with a hole at one end and with a groove running down the centre of one surface (fig. 102). Both the groove and the concavity displayed (113) Wheeler, op. cit., p. 118, pi. XXXIX, nos. 11, 12; Abdur Rahman, op. cit., pi. 94b, nos. 14-16; Mughal, ?Excavations...?, cit., fig. 37, no. 3. (114) At Ch?rsadda (2nd century B.C. - 4th A.D.) it is type III: Wheeler, op. cit., p. 118, pi. XXXIX, nos. 6, 7. At Amreli (Period II = 1st century B.C. - 5th A.D.): Rao, op. cit., pp. 105 f., fig. 28, no. 8.

Metaiwork Of some interest is a bronze or copper pin, round in section with two pointed bulging ends (fig. 103). It is conceivably a toilet object, a kind of hair-pin, in use between the 2nd and the 4th centuries A.D., where it is found also in other sites such as Damk?t IV (m) and Sirkap II (118). Bone Included among the bone objects is an item of undefinable function with a moulded cylindrical body and a hole down the centre (fig. 104), and a fragment of polished drill head (fig. 106). They both come from the lower horizon. One object whose craftsmanship is of considerable value comes from layer ?. It consists of a slightly tapering, hollow cylinder, with two groups of grooves running down it close together and bordered by round cordons (fig. 105). * "k "k From this cursory description of the material it is possible to come to a number of significant considerations for the purpose of obtaining a dynamic understanding of the trench K sequence. The material complex excavated can be divided up into two well defined horizons on the basis of certain peculiar features displayed almost exclusively by the pottery. It is in this class of materials that a clear distinction can be made between the evidence found in layers ? - ?a and ? - ?a. A whole range of typological elements present in the lower horizon disappears in the upper one where other, different ones appear. I would say, and this can be seen from the material illustrated, that the change is so radical that surviving material is practically non-existent and we are dealing with two completely different horizons with, as we have seen, perhaps a diaphragm of one century between them. The clean break between these two periods is found also in the differences in the architectural remains, the lower horizon being characterized by the use of "rubble masonry" and the upper one by "diaper masonry". On the basis of analogies found mainly with the Ch?rsadda material, but also with others, and by the discovery in layer ? of the coin possibly of Kaniska I or V?sudeva I or their types, it would be possible to assign the upper horizon to a period lying be (117) Abdur Rahman, op. cit., p. 164, pi. 91b, nos. 1-3. (118) Marshall, op. cit., p. 585, pi. 173, no. 213. 203</page><page sequence="54">tween the 1st and the 4th century A.D. This assignment is confirmed by parallels with Ch?rsadda (Ch ? - ?) and other sites, in the case of the ceramic material, and by the use described above of "diaper masonry" which, according to observations made at Sirkap is a convincing terminus post quern as it was introduced in the second half of the 1st century A.D. As well as with Ch?rsadda this horizon shows a typological and chronological corre? lation with Damk?t, which is closer at hand and part of a geographical context closely resembling that of Aligr?ma. The main elements in common are found in Periods I - III at Damk?t and, according to the dating of these periods, are spread out over a much wider time span than in our case. This can be explained by the considerations made previously concerning trench F, i.e. my personal conviction that Period I represents a mixture of various typological elements that makes it unreliable, while the correlation with Periods II and III is perfect, although perhaps II ought to be placed a little later. As well as with the nearer sites, the upper horizon of Aligr?ma has been seen to be chronologically and typologically correlatable with Amreli and other smaller sites in Saura shtra, Gujarat and the Panjab, not only because of a number of formal analogies but also because of the presence of Polished Red Ware dating back to between the 1st cen? tury B.C. and the 5th A.D. found in another very important site, i.e. Devnimori, in levels dated as 2nd - 4th centuries A.D. Although not very significant from the chronological and cultural standpoint because of their great distance apart, there are a number of typological parallels between Arikamedu and Aligr?ma. The nature of the site of Arikamedu, situated as it is on the outskirts and part of a network of international traffic, makes these typological analogies found in the 1st-2nd centuries A.D. particularly interesting as they could be evidence of relations that actually existed. Layers ? - ?a form the lower horizon which, again on the basis of correlations with Ch?rsadda (Ch (21) - (37) ), can be assigned an absolute dating lying between the 4th and the 2nd century B.C. While the lower limit is formed by elements of typological com? parison found within the 2nd century B.C., the upper one is well defined by the other Ali? gr?ma trenches where this horizon is immediately preceded by the one relevant to the Periods VI-VII of the protohistoric sequence. The expected connection with the preced? ing period is found in the type of grey-black paste used and by certain typological carry? overs. This date is also confirmed by a few fragments of vases from Period VI found among the Mauryan material which also make a useful contribution to the definition of the settlement pattern of Aligr?ma and supports the hypothesis made earlier of the ex? tensive occupation of the Period VI settlement which ultimately included also part of the hill as well as the flat portion. The base horizon of Aligr?ma K is connected, as we have seen, with a series of sites in Central Western India which all have the common feature of the Mauryan "cari nated bowls", i.e. Rupar, Bangarh and Kaus?mbi II - III. These cups are found also at Damk?t I, but in view of all the chronological problems mentioned earlier this evidence is to be treated with caution. The spread of this particular artifact seems to extend be 204</page><page sequence="55">Fig. 24 - Aligr?ma. Trench E, area E2, during the excavation; in the middle the door in wall / (Neg. no. Dep.

A small number of rodent specimens, collected during the excavation from the "Swat Grave Culture" layers (6th-5th centuries B.C.) and from layers yielding remains of the Maurya period (3rd century B.C.), were examined at the Centre de paleogeographie et de paleobiologie evolutives, Institut des Sciences de la Terre, Dijon. Jean Chaline and Daniel Helmer have kindly informed us that these specimens, consisting mainly in man? dibles and complete rows of teeth, belong to the genus Rattus, but that it is possible at present to state precisely the species. We thank them for the drawing which we reproduce here as fig. 107. S.T. 205</page></plain_text>
