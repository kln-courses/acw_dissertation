On the Foundations of Logic. EVERETT J. NELSON. The purpose of this paper is to show the necessity of a metaphysi- cal foundation for logic, to suggest such a basis, and to indicate why linguistic syntax, dispensing with metaphysics, is untenable as a theory of logic. Characterizations of logical laws as tautologies, as exhaustive of possibilities, etc., have little meaning unless they go beyond the sentence structure to the facts expressed. E.g., the form, pv - p, exhausts the possibilities, not by definition or because of its linguistic form, but because it stands for a proposition ex- pressing a fact about properties. In general, the validity of any form depends upon the structure of reality and so transcends lin- guistic syntax. Logic is a branch of metaphysics, and its laws express facts about universals and their instances. We know simple logical laws by in- tuition of their constituents, universals. In "knowing" complex ones we are acquainted not with them or necessarily with their con- stituents but with symbolic forms derivable from the symbolic ex- pression of simple ones. Contrary to Carnap's Principle of Tolerance, convention in any system is definitely limited. E.g., the Law of Contradiction limits the range of possible interpretation of a system-form. Logic is prior to syntax. Thus transformation rules for sentences must parallel rules of deduction for propositions. Though the distinctions between pseudo-sentence and sentence, and between pseudo-object and object sentence are important, the criteria for these distinctions can not be syntactically validated, but presuppose principles going beyond syntax to metaphysics. E.g., the correct analysis of a sentence containing the word "thing" is not a matter of linguistics, but of metaphysics. The syntax of a lan- guage must follow the categorial nature of the world, thus deriving its basic principles from metaphysics. 673</page><page sequence="2">674 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Is Logic a Matter of Words? W. V. QUINE. All processes of deduction in logic, including mathematics, have been reduced in recent times to the iterated application of a few notational operations. Aided by these results, Carnap has succeeded in constructing definitions of logical consequence and logical truth in purely notational or syntactical terms. One might nevertheless hold that the laws of logic are true not because of language, but because of meanings; that the syntactical specifiability of logical truth and logical consequence turns merely on an accidental ear- mark which our notation imposes. Such syntactical specifiability is thus only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition for Carnap 's further doctrine that logic is wholly a matter of linguistic decision. This philosophical doctrine must be appraised on other grounds. A principal virtue of the doctrine is the clarity with which it explains the a priori character of logic. Again, the inseparability of logic from language is hinted by the difficulty of deciding whether certain savages share our logic: for we impose our logic on them through the criteria used in constructing a dictionary of translation. Nevertheless, so long as facts are inexpressible without help of logical connectives involving logical laws, one may suspect logodaedaly in the relegation of logical laws to syntax. Substantiation calls for a detailed reconstruction of language satisfying the following condi- tions: the initial stage is to consist of simple statements which con- centrate within themselves all possible expression of factual content but exhibit no logical interdependence and include no logical truths; the successive logical locutions are then to be introduced, under lin- guistic conventions which provide the laws of logic without enriching the factual content of the language. Such a reconstruction would lend substance to the linguistic doctrine of logic-and would seem, incidentally, to merge with the empiricist's program of delineating the connections of all statements with direct observation. On the Probability of Empirical Theories. CARL G. HEMPEL. In this paper, it is tried to give the concept "probability of an empirical theory," which is frequently used in philosophical investi- gations, a precise definition in terms of the statistical theory of prob- ability. The basic idea is to define the probability of a theory by means of the relative frequency of those empirical observations which form confirming instances with respect to the theory. A definition of this kind applying to single hypotheses of a special form has already been proposed by Reichenbach; however, it is shown that as a conse- quence of this definition, two logically equivalent formulations of one and the same hypothesis may have different probabilities. This</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 675 is due to a too narrow conception of the "confirming instances." Therefore, the following essentially widened definition of the con- firming cases is proposed: Let T be a theory, i.e., any class of hy- potheses, and B a class of sentences established on the ground of observations and serving to test T. Then a confirming instance with respect to T is represented by a pair of B-sentences such that one of them can be deduced from the other by means of some of all of the hypotheses contained in T (speaking intuitively, cases of this kind represent successful predictions established with the help of T). A disconfirming instance with respect to T is represented by a pair of B-sentences such that from one of them, one can deduce, by means of T, the negation of the other.-The degree of confirmation of T with respect to B can now be defined as the number of confirming in- stances divided by the number of those which are relevant, i.e., either confirming or disconfirming with respect to T; and the prob- ability of T is defined as the limiting value towards which the degree of confirmation converges if B is infinitely extended.-The definitions here proposed do not make any restricting assumptions as to the form or to the independence of the hypotheses contained in the con- sidered theory; they define the degree of confirmation and the prob- ability for a theory taken as a whole, thus taking into account that empirical testing never applies to isolated hypotheses; and they eliminate the logical defect involved in the narrower definition con- sidered above. The Aesthetic Object and the Work of Art. GEORGE W. BEIS- WANGER. The notion that there is an aesthetic entity to which the qualities of actual works of art are attached as attributes was thoroughly developed by the Greeks, without conspicuous success. The history of aesthetic theory in Europe since the sixteenth century is largely the story of the dissolution of this concept. The Platonism of the Italian thinkers of the sixteenth century and the Aristotelianism of the formulators of the neoclassic creed both tended to stress the origin of the aesthetic in art activity. The English empiricists undermined the attributive superstructure of aesthetic objectivism and reinformed the growing conviction of the human basis of aesthetic " taste. " Objective idealism, however, was still objectivism turned outside in. It took the stress of the romantic agony of the nineteenth cen- tury to demonstrate the contradiction that existed between the central insight of romanticism, that culture and art are products of an active interaction between man and his world, and the alien con- cepts of aesthetic objectivism with which the transcendentalist en-</page><page sequence="4">676 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY deavored to justify that insight. As a result, there finally emerged a mature activistic and experiential aesthetics: the substance of art is human experience; the qualities of art are the consciously-sensed characters of experience consummated in things; the patterns of art are the order into which experience falls when guided to fulfill- ment in things by means of intelligence and skill. The work of art, as the evidence that human activity has proceeded to its concrete consummation, becomes the central aesthetie fact. By the work of art is meant, not the material products of art activity, but what these products do "with and in experience." This conception of the work of art "thus conceived as an immediate vital act" can be traced to the very beginnings of romantic theory, in Richard Wagner, Schiller, and Kant. It reaches its culmination in the aesthetic theory of John Dewey. The concept makes possible a re-definition of the aesthetic object, as the object of art activity, the purpose which it is the work of art to effect, and which may be defined as experienced experiencing. Objectivistic theories of aesthetics arise when social and cultural conditions make it imperative that the work of the artist be directed towards definite ideal ends. Such theories are false because they define art not in terms of what it actually is but in terms of what men want it to be. Such theories have seemed necessary, however, in order to vitalize art and to make it amenable to control for the sake of realizing strategic human purposes and goals. Through the Ivory Gate. MARJORIE S. HARRIS. In two ways Plato sought to awaken contemporary artists to an understanding of the nature of genuine art in order to stem the tide of inspirations coming through &amp;t' &amp;Xiqacros. He exposed the super- ficiality of the emotional expressionists and presented a constructive view of the nature of the aesthetic experience. He pointed out the abstractions in the works of those poets and painters who were fore- runners of present-day exponents of significant form and absolute poetry. Also he presented his own theory of the aesthetic object. An exhaustive presentation of this theory is obviously impossible here. We can perhaps best add to what has already been indicated concerning that view by showing the fundamental difference between Plato's view and that of the rather prevalent biological aesthetic of to-day-most adequately set forth by Mr. Dewey. Both Plato and Dewey agree on certain fundamental characteristics of the aesthetic object. Both agree on the social efficacy of the art that participates in the aesthetic object or objects. But with Plato the aesthetic ob- ject is the Idea of beauty; whereas with Dewey aesthetic objects are</page><page sequence="5">AJMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 677 born out of and vanish in the living creature's struggle to adjust to a recalcitrant environment, which, nevertheless, has an essential rhythm. But Dewey goes farther and the implications of his view concerning the aesthetic object achieved by the aesthetic sensitivity of the socially-minded artist lead Dewey nearer to the Platonic con- ception. The Meeting of Extremes in Recent Aesthetics. ROBERT C. BALD- WIN. The failure of the exponents of the various schools of aesthetics to maintain their differences on basic issues is evident, in the first instance, in that all come eventually to the same fundamental prob- lem of the definition of a standard of worth. Aesthetics is still primarily a division of axiology rather than of epistemology or logic. Further, and employing a simplified classification of views, both subjective and objective theories meet on the common ground of the task of dealing with the aesthetic object and the subject of the ex- perience of that object. Some philosophies of beauty seem to leave no place at all for the aesthetic object. Yet no thinker has taken de gustibus non disputandum seriously and consistently, mainly be- cause no one has seriously and consistently taken the aesthetic experience to be simply an affair of indiscriminate feeling or taste. The subjectivism that is unsatisfactory in epistemology and meta- physics is still unsatisfactory in aesthetics, and for essentially the same reasons. That way lies solipsism and the denial of aesthetics. The aesthetic object is indispensable, if only to make the private judgment intelligible. Thorough-going objectivism is involved in an analogous predica- ment. That way lies scepticism or a dogmatism grounded in scepticism and ignorant of the history of values. Its problem reads: How is aesthetic knowledge possible? The aesthetic experience, though its own justification as an experience, issues in an aesthetic judgment which claims to be in some sense right or true. The definition of the aesthetic experience is seen to be the delineation of a metaphysical situation. Aesthetics can not avoid saying something about the world. The inevitable straddle resulting from the efforts to do justice to the aesthetic object and our experience of it is variously described, but without concealing the essential unity of mind that both must be retained. Further, typical recent theories have as their highest com- mon factor the distinction between aesthetic and "practical " in- terests, defined in terms which echo Kant's principle of "disinter- ested satisfaction." Major differences fall to the ground under the weight of accumulated distinctions and qualifications. There is a</page><page sequence="6">678 THE JOURNVAL OF PHILOSOPHY genuine meeting of extremes with reference to conclusions as well as formulations of basic problems. The Problem of the Material in a Work of Art. JARED S. MOORE. Except in the case of painting it is easy to determine what the aesthetic "materials" or sensuous media of the various arts are. But what are the materials in painting-colors, of the pigments which reflect them? Reasons are given for adopting the former alterna- tive. Parallel distinctions are then made in the various arts between their iuaterials, and certain "auxiliary factors" involved in them- the "vehicles," "instruments," and "foundations" of those arts; and all are included under the generic category of "physical ele- ments" as follows: THE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS IN A WORK OF ART Auxiliary Factors Materials Vehicles Instruments Foundations Architecture Stone, Wood, etc. Numerous Sculpture Marble, Bronze, etc.t Painting Colors, Lines, etc. Pigments Brushes, etc. Canvas, etc. Dancing Human Figure Poetry Words (spoken) Voice Vocal cords (Written page) Music Tones (sounded) Catgut, etc. Violins, etc. (Score)' 'Technical foundations only. The Aesthetic Object. C. J. DUCASSE. Under "aesthetic objects" this paper includes not only beautiful objects but also ugly objects and objects approximately neutral in respect of beauty and ugliness. Any object of which we are con- scious is an aesthetic object when our interest in it is the aesthetic interest. Being aesthetic is thus not an intrinsic but a relational character of objects-a status conferred on them by the sort of interest someone takes in them. Practical interest in an object is interest in what to do about it, and scientific interest is interest in what to believe about it. Aesthetic interest, on the other hand, is interest in its affective tone, its import of feeling. What directly determines the nature of our aesthetic experience in any given case is not what the object before us really is (Broad's "ontological object"), but what we believe it to be (Broad's "epi- stemological object"). The aesthetic object is thus directly "ob- ject" always in the sense of epistemological object and never in the sense of ontological object. And since the epistemological object</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 679 does not exist independently of the knowing subject, the aesthetic object a fortiori does not so exist either. Any epistemological ob- ject can assume the status of aesthetic object unless its appeal to curiosity or to action is so strong as to preclude our taking in its aesthetic interest. Noetic theories of the aesthetic object, for example that of Pro- fessor Stace, contend that epistemological objects are aesthetic when and only when they possess some special kind of epistemic structure. The concluding sections of the paper attempt to show that some of the chief contentions on which Professor Stace's theory rests are invalid, and that the theory does violence to some common facts of aesthetic experience. Artistic Truth. W. T. STACE. Artistic value is no doubt ultimately relative to human nature, but there is no necessity to admit the chaotic relativism which denies the meaningfulness of objective judgments of works of art on the ground that there is no standard. There are elements of value in art which are not merely ephemeral. One of these is artistic truth. Works of art generally say something. What they say may be true. Assuming truth to mean correspondence with fact, the truth of art will be a permanent value of it. Great works of art live beyond their own time partly at least because they express some true vision. This will be disputed on the ground that only propositions or judgments can be true or false, and that therefore the vision of the artist can not be true-unless in some metaphorical sense. But the dictum that only propositions can be true is not accurate. Thoughts, for example, are true or false, but usually they are not judgments. Judgments are articulated thoughts. The objection also rests upon a false psychology which supposes that a cross-section of a man's mind would reveal it as a mixture of conceptual thoughts, emotions, desires, etc. (whether introspec- tively or behavioristically interpreted). As a matter of fact it wouLld reveal a fusion of such elements (the principle of psychologi- cal fusion). Thus perception is not a mixture of sensation and concept, but a fusion of them. Artistic vision is a fusion of sensa- tion with those concepts which are not usually fused in sense-per- ception. My contention is that concepts do not cease to be true or false when they disappear (as concepts) in the fused artistic vision.</page><page sequence="8">680 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Beauty Is Not All. An Appeal for Aesthetic Pluralism. WM. PEPPERELL MONTAGUE. Beauty is defined by Santayana as pleasure objectified, and by Kant as the power of an object to cause pleasure by its intrinsic essence rather than by its existential relation to an observer. The two definitions can be shown to mean the same thing, because pleas- ure is only externalized in an object when it is derived from its essence. Instead of restricting the realm of the aesthetic to objectified pleasure, why not broaden it to include any objectified emotion? And by emotion I mean feelings of all sorts-the sad, the terrible, and even the horrible. This is what I call aesthetic pluralism. If artists would abandon their fixation on beauty as the sole thing that is worth their while, they could make of their galleries macrocosms of the human heart and the totality of its passions. The morbid preoccupation with puLrely formal beauty could be abandoned, significant content would supplement and largely replace "significant form," and art thus broadened would no longer appeal exclusively to the aristocracy of connoisseurs and sophisticates, but also to the vast multitude of common men. Causality in the Light of Recent Physics. M. R. COHEN. The principle of causality in classical physics may be put thus: given the positions and instantaneous velocities of a system of mass- particles every other state of the system is determined. This still holds if for Newton's we substitute Einstein's or any other set of universal laws (i.e., those that assert, if A then necessarily B, or that the combination of A and non-B is impossible). The Humian and the general positivistic attack on the notion of necessity has made no impression on physics (any more than Hume's own prac- tical beliefs). For without determinism there is no basis for scien- tific search or any other planned activity. The classical view remains even if we hold with Peirce or Poincare that all our assumed laws, e.g., gravitation, vary with time-unless we assert such varia- tion to be absolutely lawless, that any physical state can be followed by any other. The new quantum mechanics seems to upset determinism by the introduction of probability functions. But while from such prob- ability functions we can never determine the position of an individ- ual, the groups or total states which they describe are still connected according to invariant relations, just as all probability theorems and computations depend on rigorous deduction. According to the ideal</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 681 of science, statistical laws (i.e., those asserting relative frequencies) must be based on universal determinants. We may have to give up such constants as the conservation of energy or certain types of con- tinuity but not all invariants or necessary order. In general, the new physics liberalizes our idea of causality, but we must not overestimate its novelty or finality. Nor should ethics and social science forget that without some necessary order, there is no way by which freedom can be achieved. Causality in Field Physics in its Bearing on Biological Causation. F. S. C. NORTHROP. There are two major movements in modern physics. The one stems from Newton and may be termed particle physics. The other arises with Faraday and Maxwell and is called field physics. Causality holds for both movements, but only by postulating quite different initial conditions. The specific full meaning of causality in any scientific theory depends upon two factors: (1) the definition of the state of the system at a given time, and (2) the relation of necessary connection between states at different times. Causality is not present unless factor (2) is satisfied. In this re- spect, particle physics and field physics are identical with respect to the status of causality. But the much more interesting and philoso- phically-important question concerning causality in any given scien- tific theory has to do with the factor (1), the definition of state at a given time, for this tells us what initial conditions the theory in question has to postulate in order that causality may be satisfied for its subject-matter. In this respect, particle physics and field physics differ in their use of causality. Field physics postulates quite different initial conditions from particle physics. The discussion of physical causality in its relation to biology as carried on by biologists and philosophers, has suffered by the unwar- ranted restriction of physical causality to that definition of state which occurs in particle physics. When this restriction is removed, by extending physical causality in its application to living things to include that definition of state which occurs in field physics, it appears that a novel and more appropriate and verifiable approach to the study of the organic characteristics of living systems is at hand. Burr's experimental findings in support of this conclusion will be indicated. T'he Problem of the Freedom of the Will and the Theory of Rela- tivity. BORIs B. BOGOSLOVSKY. The problem of the freedom of the will, in spite of numerous efforts to solve it, is still a problem. To the modern mind it is</page><page sequence="10">682 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY most puzzling -when expressed in terms of relationship between physiological processes and mental phenomena. Due to its effect on human behavior the problem acquires increasingly greater social significance. The main evidence for the deterministic position is generalizations from observations in the physical world. The basic evidence for free will is the direct awareness of it. The discrepancy between the two sets of reports is similar to the discrepancy between reports of two observers: one moving with the field of observation and another stationary in relation to it. The willingness of the relativity theory to accept both reports as real and correct to their respective observers suggests the possibility of a reconciliation of the contradictory evidences in the case of the free-will controversy. Approached in the spirit of non-Aristotelian logic of included mid- dle the problem ceases to be an insoluble puzzle and illustrates possibilities of the new logic. The Technique of Philosophic Observation. PERCY HUGHES. Philosophic generalization must rest upon philosophic observa- tion, and not upon less comprehensive contacts with reality such as mark the sciences and the arts. Upon this assumption Socrates and his immediate successors actually worked. Aristotle's doctrine of "causes" is a conjunctive proposition as to questions we should ask of any fact that we would philosophically observe. On the other hand, his doctrine of categories is a disjunctive proposition that forms the basis of reflective classification. Both "category" and "cause" have lost their ancient meaning. The term "factor" is substituted: and three factors are to be noted in all facts observed in addition to the four Aristotle named. These four must be modernized as the factors of medium, mechanism, or- ganism, and impulsion; for it is in these terms that we now actually observe, rather than reflect upon our observations. The three fac- tors are. Subjective Approach, The Evil, and Confusion. All these are factors in objects of knowledge, not merely in our knowing of them. In contrast E. G. Spaulding, in A World of Chance, says his metaphysics is a "synthesis" of "the more important results of research" in the several sciences. This Spinoza-Spencer-Spaulding method overlooks the distortion that facts suffer in observation less general than that of philosophy. In Defence of Substance. JOHN W. NASON. Substance has been traditionally conceived as a persistent entity which remains identical through change. This view of substance</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 683 has been subjected to two attacks. The empiricists would substitute collections of quantities for things; certain contemporary philoso- phers would substitute events. The empiricist contention that substance is a mere blank apart from its qualities does not prove that it is not something together with its qualities, while the positive assertion that substances are merely collections of qualities is clearly false since qualities are universals and as such can be in more than one place at the same time. Substances might, however, be collections of occurrents, and this brings us to the second attack. In his An Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy C. D. Broad suggests that we can dispense with the concept of substance and substitute that of event. His argument takes a double form: that there are absolute processes (processes which do not depend upon or imply substances) and that we can dispense with substances, since the notion of self-identity is adequately dealt with in terms of processes. The argument for absolute processes depends upon a faulty analysis of the difference between a physical event, such as the flight of a golf ball, and a conscious event, such as a buzzing noise. Broad mistakenly contends that the latter does not have a subject which is a thing and is therefore a pure process. The argument for dispensing with substance turns upon the question, whether we can account for self-identity in terms of processes. By an analysis of a process into the constituent phases Broad finds an overlapping be- tween closely related phases which allow him to talk of identity. This, however, is a psychological, not a metaphysical, concept. The oneness of an event is the result of temporal continuity, qualitative similarity, and convention, in none of which is persistent self-identity to be found. Hence, the concept of substance remains important. Some Problems of Contemporary Dialectical Materialism. JOHN MACPHERSON SOMERVILLE. This paper will discuss some of the problems involved in the handling of basic questions of nature and society by the dialectical materialists. Special reference will be made, in the light of a two- year project of investigation, to recent work in philosophy in the Soviet Union. At the outset, the chief differences between the way in which philosophy functions in the Soviet Union and in America are pointed out, and the bearing of these differences upon the dis- cussion is established. In the body of the paper the general theoretical structure now being developed in the work of Mitin, Adoratski, Deborin, Luppol, Lukach, and others is examined in terms of the following questions:</page><page sequence="12">684 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY What is the significance of the kind of problem selected for philoso- phic investigation? What estimate may be made of the "general line" of the solutions? In what sense and to what extent does contemporary work represent a development of the older views of Marx and Lenin? Comparative Philosophy. R. C. LODGE. 1. Philosophy is usually pursued by adopting a single standpoint, and-following the argument whithersoever it leads. The chief stand- points are those of (a) realism, (b) idealism, and (c) pragmatism. If we read the recent works of these three schools, we find that each claims to be in exclusive possession of the true method of philoso- phizing, and rejects the methods, if not the results, of its rivals. 2. As a secondary part of its program, each school considers critically the alternative explanations offered by other schools. This is "comparative philosophy," but, as usually practised, it is merely ancillary to the main theme, and is used to bolster up the claims of the school which is exclusively realist, or idealist, or pragmatist. Each proves to its own satisfaction that it is "right" and the rest "wrong. " 3. I suggest that we should reverse this procedure, and make "comparative philosophy" the chief method of philosophizing, and allow our individual bias in favor of one school full play only in a secondary sense, being sceptical of the claims of any single school to represent the truth adequately. 4. This is not " eclecticism " or " syncretism, " or anything of the kind. It is a comparison which preserves to each of the schools com- pared its exclusive character, but insists upon regarding it as "specu- lative " and as one of three interpretations which can only be regarded as "alternatives" and not as "final." 5. Illustrations from the different fields of philosophic investi- gation. A Realistic Theory of Distortion. EVERETT W. HALL. Realistic epistemology, based on the faith that in perception there is discovery of the very natures of objects, must yet distinguish between normal percepts and variously distorted ones. The pro- posal is to accept as normal those percepts which occur under the best conditions for knowledge, degree of distortion being determined by degree to which conditions for knowledge diverge from the best, ending in the worst. The best conditions for knowledge are those allowing the greatest discrimination of features of that type of object. The worst are those allowing no discrimination at all con-</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 685 cerning that type of object. E.g., the best light condition for per- ceiving colored objects is white light of high but not too great in- tensity, the worst is absolute darkness; under the former, the most, under the latter, the fewest colors are discriminable. In, but only in, a normal percept we discover the very characteristics of the ob- ject. It might be objected that we can not tell which (if any) of our percepts are absolutely normal. But even admitting this, it is still possible to distinguish more from less distorted ones, and to say the object is more directly revealed in the latter than in the former. Positivism as Anthropomrorphism.. CHARLES HARTSHORNE. Positivism, past or present, is akin to the notion of Protagoras: it makes man the measure of things. This is seen in several aspects of current positivism, first of all in its doctrine of meaning. Un- doubtedly the most elementary meanings to which ideas can be re- duced must be capable of exemplification in the given (including imagination as well as perception). But elementary meanings are of greater or less universality, and by the very meaning of univer- sality the relatively universal meanings can be known in ignorance of many of the more particular meanings which might come under it. Hence it is meaningful to say that many species of thing may exist which we can not know or even conceive, except in more or less vague, general terms. For example, the qualities of feeling and sensation felt by a frog. Positivism meets this by "translating" frog feelings into frog behavior and structure. But the translation preserves identity of content only upon the assumption of psycho- physical correlations which positivists say are contingent, not logical or a priori. This is not identity such as that between table and Tisch. Moreover, even the physical structure of the world is partly inaccessible to man. Electrons need not be so completely alike in behavior as they are for our knowledge, nor need the laws which can be learned by examining what is now happening apply to the re- mote past. Methodological subjectivism, positivism in the narrow sense, is clearly anthropomorphic. All things are held to be ex- pressible in terms of the data human beings can have of them. But the data individuals-as non-human minds-may have of themselves and of the world are left out of this human introspective account. Only omniscience, an all-sympathetic mind able to feel all feel- ings and think all thoughts, without losing its own identity, could validly profess a pure positivism. Re-examination of the Tradition of Dualism. Louis J. A. MERCIER. All possible interpretations of reality are reducible to two: monism and dualism. Dualism was dominant in the West until</page><page sequence="14">686 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the nineteenth century and even to this day is exercising a major influence since, for instance, it is still the philosophical basis of American polity. Does the tradition of dualism receive the atten- tion in our histories of philosophy which it deserves in consequence? There are various reasons for its neglect including its connection with scholasticism which, after its high period, fell into a decadence and largely lost its own tradition even among its natural adherents, while contrary schools persistently misrepresented as necessary its connection with theology. This has all been changed by the neo- scholastic revival of the sixth century. On the other hand, monism, in so far as it gained ascendency in the course of the same century, would seem to have led to a subjectivism which makes it very diffi- cult to establish values. Has not the time then come for a new approach to philosophical discussion through an objective and sys- tematic comparative study of the monistic and dualistic points of view on such fundamentals as the origin and nature of reality, the problem of knowledge, and the problem of values? Only repre- sentatives of both schools working together can accomplish this. It may be that this needed work may best be done in America, and the spirit which made possible this joint meeting would no doubt suffice to insure at least such a measure of success as would make for a better objective understanding of our fundamental alterna- tives of thought. On the Nature of the Union of Mind and Body. W. H. SHELDON. Mind-body dualism, here accepted, forces on us the difficult prob- lem of interaction; yet if mind and body are in some sense one (as they are) the difficulty would seem to be overcome. But how can they be one, under dualism? Now we find that mind-quite unlike body-has the power of identifying itself with something beyond or other than itself. Thus in knowing, the mind literally includes the form of the object, and in benevolent action the mind identifies its own interests with those of another person. So in its sensa and images the mind identifies itself with processes in the sense-organs and nervous system. Its immediate feeling of those processes, together with the processes of the autonomic system, fur- nish the material on which all natural knowledge and emotion are based. This identification is an act of mind, not of the body; for it varies much in direction and degree, depending on attention. Thus on its cognitive side, the union of mind and body is due to the mind. On its active side, the mind identifies itself with the natural tendencies of the body (impulses, instincts) though here too in varying direction and degree. Thus the mind-body union, to some extent always present, is due to the action of the mind.</page><page sequence="15">BOOK REVIEWS 687 The body never of itself alone influences the mind. How mind can influence body-the other part of the problem-is not here con- sidered.</page></plain_text>
