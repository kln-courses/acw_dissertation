Dr. A arouses our sympathy, since he has a predilection for his subject; the impressive bibliography shows that he has consulted a great number of books, some of which will interest the reader, because they are less accessible nowadays. Parts of the book will also be read ?with agreement, e. g. Ch. V p. 71 (????? as the ideal of the Homeric man), Ch. VI, the problem of suffering in Homer, pp. 80-83, polemics against Latte's view on sin. However, on the whole, I must conclude that the subject which Dr. A. has attacked,</page><page sequence="2">DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA 255 is somewhat too difficult for a beginner. Moreover, the author was handicapped by the fact that his promotor, Prof. Bellon, is not a Grecian; thus for instance, Ch. V pp. 75 ff. the discussion on ???es??, conscience, etc. is vitiated from the very beginning, be- cause Dr. A. does not know the book by Laroche, Histoire de la racine nem- en grec ancien (for ???es?? cf. also Rev. Phil. 1951, 256 f.). I offer a few examples in order to show that my assertions are not gratuitous or subjective. It is surprising that in a book on Homeric religion and ethics ?s?? should not even be mentioned, let alone treated. One is again disagreeably surprised at the fact that Dr. A. apparently does not know del Grande, Hybris (Napels, 1947). Even if we are ready to forgive this omission, we must state that Dr. A. does not have a right view on the subject and has not correctly delimitated the different spheres of the word. He ap- parently considers all the cases in which hybris occurs in Homer to be identical, though, in my opinion, there is a marked difference between the hybris of Thamyris (B 594 ff.) or Eurytos (T 226 ff.) and that of the suitors (? 63 f. and ? 351 f.). Thamyris and Eurytos have committed no offence which, in our eyes, is of an ethical nature. They have been overbold in contesting with gods. The transgressions of the suitors, on the other hand, are ethically very objectionable. Nevertheless, the curious fact presents itself that Thamyris, etc. are punished immediately, whereas the wicked suitors have the opportunity to commit their transgressions for years. In Thamyris' case the gods were directly offended and, therefore, they punished directly, whereas the transgressions of the suitors, which were directed against other men, did not provoke direct punishment from the side of the gods. We touch here upon one of the most important points of Homeric religion which, unfortunately, has not been discussed or mentioned by Dr. A. For this reason I also differ from his views expounded in Ch. IV. Dr. A. here discusses the fact that, on the one hand, the gods support the ethical order of things (cf. e. g. ? 384 ??&gt; rightly explained by Dr. A. pp. 26 f.), whereas, on the other hand, they continually transgress that order. Dr. A. thinks that the details illustrating the latter fact must be regarded as poetical liberties, caused by the necessities of composition, etc., an explanation which is impossible. Here, too, we must take account of the fact that the gods are egotistical and capricious, and are represented by the poet (and apparently also by his contemporaries) as endowed with human passions. Though they guarantee the ethical order in general, they trangress it, as soon as it is in their own interest, just as Napoleon gave the code Napoleon, but transgressed its requirements in his</page><page sequence="3">256 DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA personal life. This anomaly is painful, but is a necessary conse- quence of the anthropomorphic representation of the gods. Conse- quently also man's conduct has its weaknesses in this respect. Thus in a 2?2 ff. Ilos has respect for the gods and does not provide Odysseus with poison for his arrows (cf. Dr. A. p. 27) ; the speaker's (Mentes') father, however, did not have any scruples and offered the poison (unfortunately Dr. A. has omitted this point). I finally draw attention to p. 37 f., a discussion by Dr. A. of the false oath. G 278 f. and ? 259 f. offer the highly interesting idea that persons who take a false oath are punished after death for it *). Dr. A. p. 113 doubts this fact; in my opinion, he is wrong here, since we have the express testimony of the Iliad. In this connection, I first of all refer to Hes. Op. 174-202 and 327-332, where particularly heavy sins are enumerated. These sins concern transgressions against parents, guests, gods. Apparently Hesiod and his contem- poraries considered them capital sins. We can expect that these transgressors will be heavily punished. Now we see that in the Odyssey, in ? 575-600, persons who have committed a transgression against the gods are punished after death. I believe that we must connect these facts. By the oath a treaty or contract is sanctioned and thus a new order of things is established. This new order of things is guaranteed by the gods who are invoked on the occasion. Thus the person who violates the oath, transgresses the new order of things established by the gods and directly sins against them. For this reason he is punished after death, just as the sinners in ? 575-600. Rumpt (Gld). M. H. A. L. H. van der Valk ?)
