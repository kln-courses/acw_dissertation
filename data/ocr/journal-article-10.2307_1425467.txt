<plain_text><page sequence="1">Auguste Perret: Invention in Convention, Convention in Invention AMY GARDNER, University of Maryland Architectural theories developed at an accelerated rate in eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth- century France as a result of debates regarding theories based on masonry construction tech- niques and those based on innovations in struc- tural types. French architectural theory was at once preoccupied with the need to explain the new structural types in terms of the existing masonry theories and the need to develop new theories based on the new types. The consequent tension between these two traditions was both critical to the transformation of architectural language and clearly visible in the work of architects building in Paris, particularly in the work of Auguste Perret. This article proposes a rereading of Perret's work, identifying uniquely French representational and constructional traditions as the context for inter- preting his work. Moreover, contradictions in Perret's work from 1928 to 1940 reveal certain aspects of the rationalist debate in France and, thus, aspects of French modern architecture. IN EIGHTEENTH-, NINETEENTH-, AND TWENTIETH- century France, conflicts between theories of architecture spurred the advancement of new theories. In the eighteenth century, theories of architecture based on the cosmic order collided with new empirical theories of architecture and engineering based on the discovery of the natural laws of physics. The emergence of engineering as a distinct disci- pline challenged the realm of the architect, who no longer operated as the descendant of the master builder. Instead, the profes- sion perceived itself as being relegated to addressing superficial questions related to the surface in which visual rules for order and stability guided architectural principles. In the nineteenth century, architectural theory developed even further as a result of the debates between extant theories of archi- tecture based on masonry construction techniques and those based on innovations in structural types: the cast-iron frame and the concrete frame. Twentieth-century French architec- tural theory, debate, and criticism was pre- occupied with the need to explain the new structural types in terms of the existing ma- sonry theories or the need to develop new theories based on the new types. The result- ing tension was one of the fundamental fac- tors in the evolution of modern architecture and in the transformation of architectural language. This transformation is clearly vis- ible in the work of architects building in Paris and in the work of Auguste Perret in particular. This article traces aspects of the development of modern architecture by ex- ploring the relationship of construction technique to traditions in formal language from the sixteenth century through the twentieth century. According to Peter Collins in Concrete: The Vision ofa New Architecture and Kenneth Frampton in Studies in Tectonic Culture, Auguste Perret sought to establish a specifi- cally French modern architectural language rooted in the theoretical constructs of the Abbe de Cordemoy and the Abbe Laugier, which are, in effect, the synthesis of Greco- Gothic rationalism. Frampton contends that "the Greco-Gothic ideal was to permeate the work of Perret at every level, and while his use of neo-Platonic form and his particular vision of human destiny were to remain unequivo- cally Greek, his attitudes toward production were to be drawn from medieval culture."' Collins portrays Perret's work as the embodi- ment of Greco-Gothic ideals and the transfor- mation of those traditions through an abstracted character and new materials, meth- ods, and sequence of construction.2 Roberto Gargiani, in his book Auguste Perret, illumi- nates the synthesis of classicism, construc- tional rationalism, and symbolism in Perret's oeuvre that produced a powerful polemic and a poetic architecture rich in metaphor. In contrast to these interpretations, this article proposes another reading of the work of Auguste Perret in which the archi- tect and aspects of French modern architec- ture are interpreted in the context of a specifically French tradition: the continua- tion of the weaving of tectonic and repre- sentational systems that formed the practice of masonry construction in France in the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. Perret's quest to establish a specifically French modern architectural language rooted in certain Greco-Gothic rationalist traditions may be viewed as the result of this weaving. He produced a body of work re- markable in its nature as both mature and transitional. It is a significant, identifiably French classical-modern architecture, how- ever transitional in its role as prelude to a layered system of construction and repre- sentation. Contradictions evident in Perret's work from 1928 to 1940 reveal certain as- pects of the rationalist debate in France and thus certain aspects of French modern ar- chitecture. Perret Auguste Perret was born in exile in Ixelles, Belgium, in 1874. His father, Claude-Marie Perret, was a Burgundian mason who came to Paris and worked for three years before the Franco-Prussian war. After fleeing Paris during the Communard Insurrection in 1871, Claude-Marie found employment with an extraordinarily skilled craftsman in Ixelles. After four years of extensive training and experience, especially in stereotomy, Claude-Marie Perret established his own building contracting enterprise. The Perrets had two more children after Auguste's birth: Gustave in 1876 and Claude in 1880. In 1881, when the French government declared a general amnesty for political offenses, the Perret family returned to Paris, where Claude-Marie began another Journal ofArchitectural Education, pp. 140-155 ? 1997 ACSA, Inc.

Auguste and Gustave were pressed into service as soon as they were old enough, drawing in the office or working on buildings under construction. In addition to this practical technical experience, both sons entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts and were indoctrinated in the embattled, beleaguered traditions of a classical architectural education. Although both Auguste and Gustave were excellent students, neither received diplomas, as this would have precluded their careers as build- ing contractors.3 Thus in 1895, Auguste Perret left the icole des Beaux Arts for full- time employment in his father's firm. The firm, eventually known as Perret Fr'res, was certified as being qualified to build using Franqoise Hennebique's pat- ented technique for reinforced concrete construction.4 Hennebique prospered by training contractors in this system, allowing its use under license. It was considered highly prestigious to be a contractor quali- fied and licensed in the Hennebique system; Perret used this prestige and the possibilities of this system to convince his father to use the system in 1902 for the construction of 28, rue Franklin. The Hennebique system was critical to Perret's expressive use of con- crete. Because column and beam connec- tions did not require concrete capitals, Perret was able to create a concrete frame that evoked a simple timber frame. The pos- sibilities of this nuance were to have a sig- nificant impact on the expressive dimension of Perret's work. As a building contractor and architect with a lengthy apprenticeship so thoroughly grounded in both the theory and the prac- tice of architecture, Perret inherited the tra- ditions of both professions and may be considered a twentieth-century master builder or master mason. A formal analysis of Perret's work and an exploration of his construction documents renew the focus on 1. Building on the Chausde d'Antin, Paris.

Flashback: Traditions in French Masonry Construction The evolution of French masonry traditions provides a context for analyzing Perret's work. Masonry was the predominant build- ing culture in France in the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries.5 From ver- nacular to royal construction, masonry load-bearing assembly was the dominant craft. This was largely a result of the build- ing materials available in the region of the Parisian basin, where the passage of the Seine River helped to create an extremely soft type of limestone (Figures 1 and 2). In addition, quarriable stones were of insuffi- cient size and tensile strength to create genuine post-and-beam construction in masonry. Partially for this reason, stone ar- chitectural elements of post and beam were not present as elements of construction or representation in France before the six- teenth century. Thus, the tectonic expres- sion of the wall was a continuous and monolithic one. 2. Building on the Chausde d'Antin, detail. 1 41 Gardner</page><page sequence="3">This is not to say that timber con- struction was absent. In fact, the reverse is true. Medieval timber structures were present in parts of France where forests were plentiful, and an archetypal timber frame was encoded within the articulation of the sixteenth- to seventeenth-century masonry wall. This frame was expressed by carving column, beam, and infill panel elements into the soft surface of the wall. The wall remained the structural element on which the elements were carved. Stone joints of the wall often occurred without regard to the shapes of the superimposed architectural el- ements. The resulting schism between the structural element of the wall and the repre- sentation of superimposed architectural el- ements demonstrated the impulse to give the wall and the frame equal tectonic "voice." This tension between the wall and the frame laid the foundation for significant conflicts in nineteenth-century architectural tectonic development. In developing the art of stereotomy, master masons facilitated the transformation of the wall into the frame. Philibert de l'Orme, an architect and master mason, ex- emplifies the tradition of the master builder, which persisted well into the seventeenth century. The son of a mason, de l'Orme is notable for his contributions to the craft of masonry construction and expression. He was responsible for the chateau and chapel at Anet as well as many other projects, some conducted when he was superintendent of royal buildings for Henry II, beginning in 1548. He wrote Nouvelles Inventions pour bien bdtir et h petitfrais in 1561 and Premier Tome de lArchitecture in 1567.6 Having writ- ten Books III and IV of the Premier Tome de l'Architecture, he is credited with codifying the art of stereotomy, or descriptive geom- etry in stone.7 Stereotomic drawings docu- ment the specific geometry of stone shapes needed to create complex forms such as vaults and stairs. His most valuable accom- plishment was to marry the medieval knowl- edge of stone masonry with Renaissance knowledge of perspective construction, mak- ing it possible to create a proscriptive con- struction document that related a plan to a three-dimensional drawing. Thus, this draw- ing established a relationship between con- ceptualizing and drawing space and methods of construction. It informed the mason in advance of the precise shape required of each piece of stone relative to its place in the three-dimensional construct. The signifi- cance of this discovery is that the joint be- tween stones was no longer responsible for taking up the slack between imprecisely cut stones. The medieval stone mortar joint, of- ten thick and variable, was the pochi of ma- sonry construction. Through stereotomy, the stone mortar joint became quite thin, giving rise to the possibility that the shape of the stone could coincide with the intended character of the architectural element. The promise of this discovery with regard to the evolution of the column and the wall was fulfilled in each successive generation of building craftsmen and architects from Philibert de l'Orme to Perret. The classical trabeated model was in- troduced in France in the sixteenth century under the direction of Franrois I. Renais- sance Italian architects and artists were com- missioned to work in France, and the theory and works of figures such as Leon Battista Alberti, Sebastiano Serlio, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, and Vitruvius were carefully studied. However, as the column was com- monly conceived by French masons and ar- chitects as a modulation on the surface of the wall, trabeated language developed ini- tially as surface articulation on a load-bear- ing masonry wall (Figure 3). Unlike the earlier relationship between wall and frame, however, the stone shape corresponded more precisely with the architectural ele- 3.

This compatibility between structural and architectural ele- ments coincided with the coherent develop- ment of the classical vocabulary in France by such architects as Frangois Mansart. However, the classical Italian model, de- scribed by Peter Collins as a model in which the natural expression of a wall is a frame with non-load-bearing infill, collided with representational systems already present in French masonry construction.8 Representational traditions in ma- sonry construction outside of the classical model may be studied through the way openings were made in the wall and the way walls met at corners. The typical window in public and private buildings of the French Renaissance, and during the classical and baroque periods, was extremely tall.

The solid spaces between the windows were often equal to or less than the width of the void of the win- dow. These proportions yielded solid ele- ments that were thin enough to appear like piers, or a primary frame. Windows were bounded by projecting stone jambs, heads, and sills that were connected to belt courses and pilasters. In effect, this banding ex- pressed a secondary frame into which the window appeared wedged and in which the window jambs became columnar elements. The interconnection of secondary frames es- sentially broke up the wall into rectangular compartments, at least half of which were void. Thus these walls were not only very porous, but also tended to appear as stone frames with infill panels rather than as con- tinuous surfaces with apertures.9 This frame did not adopt the language of the classical trabeated system. Rather, the articulation of the constituent part of the window yielded a reading of a frame that is akin to a wood frame transcribed into stone (Figures 4 to 6). From the beginning of the seven- teenth century, the stone infill panels within the compartmentalized wall were often fur- ther carved to create the appearance that they were nonstructural elements. In some conditions, the panels were carved so that there was a deep reveal between the flat sur- face of the panel and the adjacent secondary frame, thus emphasizing the disconnection between structure and infill. In other condi- tions, human figures, vegetation, or other shapes were sculpted into the panels, dis- rupting the reading of a continuous ma- sonry load-bearing wall. Franqois Mansart's treatment of the joining of two walls at a corner pilaster dem- onstrates an important aspect of the evolu- tion of the frame from the wall through a more sophisticated stereotomic exercise. His technique also illustrates the use of a classi- cal vocabulary more in keeping with the ca- nonical classical model. For instance, Mansart's work, as exemplified by the H6tel Guinegaud in Paris, reflects conditions of the stone frame as described earlier. How- ever, in the chateaux of Blois and Maisons, Mansart developed a full vocabulary of clas- sical columns, entablatures, and pilasters. Peter Smith observed that instead of pulling the column back a few inches from an out- side or inside corner, Mansart emphatically joined the pilaster faces. The result implies a full column embedded in the wall, rather 6. H6tel St. Aignan, facade on the street, Paris, 145-48, Pierre Le Muet.

The position of the joint supports a discrete reading of the elements on and in the wall. At Maisons, details that reveal Mansart's intentions include the care- ful placement of joints such that full stones appeared on pier faces. He positioned joints such that none split the stone vertically or horizontally. In Mansart's conception of the column, the representational traditions of the classical model converge with the evolu- tion of the French masonry frame. This development of a position be- tween tectonic characterizations of the wall and the frame may be understood with ref- erence to Alberti's resolution of the Greek and Roman models of construction and representation in de Re Aedificatoria. Hubert Damisch noted that Alberti arrived at a theoretical model of a structure in which the wall and column are inextricable and interdependent. Damisch observed, "Clearly this kind of wall is not conceived at all as a 'constructed monolith.' . . . Alberti intended to define a mode of construction in which the skeleton could not be isolated out of the paries; [every vertical structure erected to support a covering] .... In such a system, the column could not be opposed to the wall any more than it could be coupled with it.""' The wall in the hotelparticulier in Paris illustrates a critical development in the evolution of the wall and the frame that re- flects Alberti's model. This development is particularly evident in the ways in which windows were made in the wall. The typical solid-to-void proportional relationship was such that the wall between the windows be- came little more than a pier. Masonry con- struction traditions defined such an element as a trumeau. In citing Fdlibien d'Aviler and Enlart, the Architecture Inventaire General des Monuments et des Richesses Artistiques de la France gives conflicting definitions of the trumeau: as wall but not pier, as pier but not wall, thus as neither and as both.12 In his definition of the structural model, Alberti, in effect, described the trumeau. Damisch observed that "long before other contempo- rary engineers, Alberti recognized that in spite of its monolithic and regular appear- ance, the wall of Hadrian's Pantheon was itself articulated by a network of superim- posed brick arches in the mass of the ma- sonry."'3 In Alberti's system, the perforated masonry wall was a masonry frame, yet the frame was the wall. In the milieu of seven- teenth-century French masonry traditions, the trumeau was the solid element in a per- forated masonry wall that could, by virtue of its proportions and construction, be de- fined as an element of the frame or a piece of the wall (Figure 7). In the hotelparticulier, the typical sec- ondary frame was articulated such that the interstitial window and solid wall panels be- came infill between horizontal and vertical elements of the frame. The handling of the secondary frame prevented the wall from be- ing interpreted as a continuous element, in that the jambs and moldings of the windows projected forward from the wall surface. Like the trumeau, this condition was also repre- sented in Alberti's model, especially where the jambs in the secondary frame acted visu- ally as columns. Damisch observes that "it is also certain that an opening, far from being necessarily prejudicial to the stability of the wall, may contribute to it, provided it is it- self handled in accordance with Alberti's principle, and the jambs assuming the role of columns, so that they become part of the skeleton."" The evolution of the jamb into an element of the frame and the persistence of the trumeau led to articulations of the modern frame. Thus the column that even- tually developed in twentieth-century French architecture is representationally and tectonically rooted in the transformations of the wall and in the trumeau, rather than in classical trabeated models. The Intervening Period: Context The world of classical French masonry con- struction is the background for the eigh- teenth- and nineteenth-century debates on classical rules of order and ideas of expressive, functional, and structural truths. The En- lightenment left a legacy of a codified struc- tural rationalism that was defined through the polemics of Cordemoy and Laugier. Cordemoy prescribed a unity of the whole, in volumetric terms, wherein each structural el- ement retained its independent identity. Laugier subsequently argued for the primacy of the column. Frampton points out that "it is difficult to adequately represent the cul- tural complexity of the synthesis that Fremin, Cordemoy, and Laugier successively sought to achieve in their drive to promote a hypo- thetical Greco-Gothic architecture embody- ing the character of degagement, that is, columnar articulation within the ordinance of Neo-Platonic form."" Regarding the sur- face, Cordemoy eschewed ornament in the form of surface modeling; he preferred plain masonry surfaces. In Essai sur l'Architecture, Laugier proposed an ethical lens through which ar- chitecture could be viewed. He argued that structural logic, seen as a natural principle, was a vehicle for architectural truth, and he proposed vrai (truth) and crime as moral categories applicable to architecture. The nineteenth century built on this eighteenth- century legacy; the ideals of Eugene- Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc continued the call for a direct relationship between struc- tural integrity and architectural form.

Viollet-le-Duc, any evolution in architec- tural form could only evolve through the undisguised use of a new structural system or material. In polemical position and built work, Perret is indebted to these theoretical con- structs. What he owes to Viollet-le-Duc Perret himself acknowledged; Perret's father owned a copy of the Entretiens, to which Perret was exposed at an early age. Collins observes that "although his later work is usu- ally regarded rightly as extremely Classical, he himself always contended that he was re- ally following the medieval doctrines of Viollet-le-Duc, and that he had remained faithful to them through his life."'6 Regard- ing an economy of means, Roberto Gargiani noted that "the parameters of economy have multiple implications in the theory of Perret. He reflects the French rationalist orientation that reached conclusion, beginning with Marc-Antoine Laugier then with Jean- Nicholas-Louis Durand, with the expression of a theoretic radicalism centered on the con- cept of utility. In the work of Perret, this ori- entation joins that of a modern pragmatism of the building contractor, and often is trans- lated through formal options corresponding to the organizational logic of the construc- tion site."17 Other influences also shaped Perret's position. Romantics such as Henri Labrouste insisted on a legible iconic pro- gram. Engineers, such as Charles Louis Ferdinand Dutert and Gustave Eiffel, con- tributed their conceptual framework, spirit of innovation, and method of practice. In addition to these influences, Perret's experience at the Ecole des Beaux Arts considerably influenced his polemical and formal development. Auguste and Gustave Perret passed their formative years under the tutelage ofJulien Guadet, a fact of considerable import in any consideration of their professional contributions. Guadet, a pupil of Henri Labrouste, was in 1871 one of the few architects who was prepared, theo- retically and technically, to lead and teach. In addition, Guadet's son Paul, who was in the atelier along with Auguste and Gustave, formed a fast friendship with the brothers, allowing them much time in the Guadet home in more casual, but nonetheless signifi- cant, contact with Julien Guadet. Although construction was the mother tongue of ar- chitecture for Guadet, structure and con- structional strategies were but a means to an end. Discovering the internal logic of the structure was not an end in itself, nor did the structure develop through its own evolution- ary schema. Rather, the architect's choice of structural system and material reality grew out of the response to experiential, emo- tional, and programmatic exigencies. Guadet said, "Construction must be the constant guiding thought of the architect, it furnishes him the arsenal of its resources, it limits also his domain. All architectural attempts that would not be constructable do not count, all architectural form that violates or falsifies the construction is vicious. And if by this word construction you hear the structure as well as the building, its entire and effective reality, can you conceive that the executed building expresses other things that this structure, that this construction, expresses itself?."'8 Perret's work fulfilled this promise of a ratio- nal structure parlante in which an ordered yet expressive armature was formed as a response to functional, formal, constructional, and symbolic programs. Despite Perret's debt to the theoretical constructs of these figures, he was also ex- posed to other aspects of practice. The writ- ings of Laugier and Viollet-le-Duc discussed masonry craft and practice as a source of knowledge critical to the practice of architec- ture. Laugier, in his Essai, warned the archi- tect that "those who know the science of stonecutting do wonders at small cost.... Therefore, an architect cannot work too hard to gain so precious a knowledge, the most mysterious part of architecture."'" Viollet-le-Duc proposed that all architects should be specialists in stone. He believed that the architect should decide the shape of the stone and that architects should know the quarry from which the stone came, what size stone was necessary, and the properties and qualities of stone. For Viollet-le-Duc, this knowledge, parallel to that of the medi- eval master mason, was crucial to the architect's ability to sustain his professional stature and control in light of the growing role of the engineer. And in the end, Viollet- le-Duc firmly believed that the architect who was connected with the properties and methods of working masonry material moved closer to the medieval process and, thus, truth. The architect must operate within the tradition of homofaber to be most competent. Perret's theoretical base in 1 45 Gardner</page><page sequence="7">Greco-Gothic synthesis and structural ratio- nalism was grounded in theories of craft from which the Greco-Gothic model grew. Rereading Perret The evolution of the exterior wall in Perret's work demonstrates the continuity of the French masonry tradition. The promise of a rationalized stereotomy was fulfilled in ma- ture examples of his work (from 1900 through the end of his career, most power- fully from the twenties on). He guided the primary and secondary frames initiated by the translation from wood into stone along their evolutionary journey, however trans- formed in concrete. The frame evolved to the point where it and the wall were no longer materially homogeneous or coplanar, but dis- crete, such that their relationship raised the possibility of two interdependent systems. This possibility spawned the idea of a layered rather than a monolithic wall and eventually, the condition in which the roof and its sup- porting frame were disengaged from the wall and its supporting frame.20 Despite the clearer identity of the frame as it became dis- engaged from the wall, the seventeenth-cen- tury masonry waxing and waning of dominance between the wall and the frame still lurked in the reading of the exterior wall. Several aspects of Perret's polemic and his built work provide a context for this dis- cussion. In 1944, Perret wrote a volume of aphorisms entitled Contribution ht une theorie de l'Architecture that constituted his theory of architecture.21 The volume includes fif- teen epigrams; the introductory portion is devoted to the notation of essential spatial and structural archetypes, and the central portion is concerned with technique and construction. In the introductory portion, Perret established the conception of the abri souverain, or an all-encompassing protective overhead cover. In the central portion, i. 1FUl~t?;:; .,rk:? :?: ?I~a~-~.?::I~ rr~ ':? ::.:: i: ;11E~f I il? :: i ?: ?:: n~li? ~ IP~CL~:i~F~ r' :H ": - Illra~? ?;.f ST 13i .?"

Perret described the ossature (skeleton) of an animal as the analog for the structural frame- work of a building and proposed le charpente (carpentry) as the archetypal structural framework. For Perret, the very definition of a building is carpentry: "The building is car- pentry accompanied by elements and forms imposed by the permanent conditions to which nature submits it, and that connect it with the past and confer upon it the ability to endure."22 He proposed the continuation of the carpentry model in steel or concrete, ready "to cover the world with an authentic architecture."23 In Perret's polemic, the abri souverain is supported by the archetypal ossature. Also, in this polemic it is a crime to hide the supporting element. He stated that "he who disguises any part of the wood frame deprives himself of the only legitimate and the most beautiful ornament in archi- tecture. He who disguises a column commits a fault. He who makes a false column com- mits a crime."24 Thus, Perret dedicated par- 9.

He care- fully chose and detailed infill materials to highlight their non-load-bearing nature, us- ing textures, joint placement, color, and re- lief to emphasize the distinction between porteur and porteuse-that which carried and that which was carried. He illustrated these principles in sev- eral built works. In the apartment building and offices at 51, rue Raynouard in Paris (1928-1930), Perret reinterpreted elements of French masonry construction through concrete construction. The building in- cluded the primary frame, the secondary grid of the window system and its attendant parts, window jambs that acted as columns (as in Alberti's model), and the tertiary panelized wall surface beyond. The building at 51, rue Raynouard may be compared to the chateau and stables at Vaux-le-Vicomte, February 1997 JAE 50/3 1 46</page><page sequence="8">10. Vaux-le-Vicomte, stables. 11. Vaux-le-Vicomte, stables detail. 12. 51, rue Raynouard, detail. built by Louis Le Vau in 1657 to 1661. The compositional order and constituent archi- tectural elements of the facades of 51, rue Raynouard restated the classical composi- tional order of Vaux-le-Vicomte. The cor- nices, pilaster, entablatures, window jambs, sills, and heads of Vaux-le-Vicomte are all present but are reinterpreted in austere con- crete shapes. Even Perret's panelized wall surface both echoed and reinterpreted the rustication of the main chateau. However, the facades are more closely linked to the fa- cades of the stables at Vaux-le-Vicomte. For example, the use of a reveal to separate the masonry panel from the frame by a reveal in the service buildings was restated in 51, rue Raynouard (Figures 8 toll). Perret not only reintroduced the French masonry tradition in terms of facade order and detail, but revived the stereotomic tradition. Each element-the pilasters, the wall surface, the window frames, and the cornices-was an individual unit shaped as required for assembly and representation. Perret refused to allow the glazing of a win- dow to disappear into the wall. In 51, rue Raynouard, he resolved a dilemma of con- struction fabrication and sequence, design- ing a precast window frame that was inserted into the site-cast concrete structural frame. Perret wedged this window frame into the concrete frame as it was in seventeenth-cen- tury masonry traditions. A typical window treatment in sixteenth- and seventeenth-cen- tury masonry buildings (and in the Gothic tradition in some cases) had a wide frame that projected and another thinner frame that made the transition to the wall.25 Perret's window also had this thinner frame that anchors, aligns, and thus standardized the thin, precast concrete masonry panels (Figure 12). In this effort to resolve the tech- nical and sequential dilemmas by combining precast elements with a site-cast frame, Perret "unwittingly reproduced a form evolved for decorative purposes in France in the classical age."26 However, the signifi- cance of his solution lies not only in the translation of an architectural element from one idiom to another, but also in the rein- statement of stereotomic logic through modern construction technique. Projects conceived or built before this discovery did not include a facade expres- sion of primary and secondary frame with infill. Once Perret established the primary and secondary frames and infill, he was able to consider separating the wall into layers. In the Siege du Service Technique des Con- structions Navales (1928-1931), the facade expression indicates the existence of both primary and secondary frames; however, the roof is expressed as joined to the wall. This is also true of the Siege du Garde Meuble (1935-1936). Ultimately, Perret achieved and clearly expressed the separation of the wall and the roof in the Musde des Travaux Publics (Museum of Public Works, 1936- 1937 2, supporting the roof on a primary 1 47 Gardner</page><page sequence="9">13.

In fact, the expression of frame and the wall in Perret's work reached maturity in the Musde des Travaux Publics. In 1934, Perret designed an entry for the competition at Chaillot for the new Palais du Trocaddro, intended for the 1937 Paris Exhibition. Although the project was not chosen to be built, Perret was commissioned, as a consolation, to build the Mused des Travaux Publics next door.28 The purpose of the building was to exhibit objects and infor- mation regarding public architectural and en- gineering projects. The first floor of the building was to contain large models and heavy installations. The site of the building was a triangle whose vertex was a circular place.29 The two equal legs of the triangle that converged on the place were sloping. Thus the side of the building facing the Avenue Presi- dent Wilson was nearly four meters higher than the side facing the Avenue d'Idna. The intent was to create two equal wings, converg- ing in a rotunda that faced the place.3 Perret created a site section that included a base, or dais, in which all the mechanical and electri- cal equipment is located (Figures 13 to 15). This dais resolved the sectional differential across the site. Following the model of the Greek Temple, Perret placed giant order col- umns that support the roof and located the enclosing wall approximately a half meter be- hind the columns (Figure 16). The typical conditions of the facade, as exemplified on the Avenue d'Idna, constitute a lexicon of many of the traditions in French masonry wall construction. The facade com- position on the Avenue d'Idna consisted of a giant order that created a shallow loggia on a base. The wall behind this loggia at the ground floor is the wall that demonstrates the transformation of French masonry technique into precast and cast-in-place concrete, as does the wall in the rue Raynouard building. The windows in the ground floor of the fa- cade were designed as large, vertically ori- ented double-hung windows with the same types of stone jamb, head, and sill details found in the masonry traditions of the hotel particulier. Perret detailed these jambs, heads, and sills as precast concrete elements that performed several tasks. They created a sec- ondary frame and held in place the concrete panels between the windows. These concrete panels were assembled such that they recall traditionally laid-up masonry, as do those on the rue Raynouard apartments. The termi- nology in Perret's construction documents for this area between the windows of the fa- cade was trumeau. Perret was very specific in his nomenclature for architecture elements regarding constructional logic and symbolic content.3' In this case, he purposefully used a traditional masonry term whose definition oscillates between wall and pier to describe an element of construction and representation February 1997 JAE 50/3 1 48</page><page sequence="10">ii C7:""?~~ Ii? ? . . ,' 15 rff-2-1/1 17, %,-- 16.

The definition of trumeau given in the Architecture Inventaire General des Monuments et des Richesses Artistiques de la France also includes a reference to the pier that typically divides a portal into two openings, as in Romanesque examples.32 This pier was typically a masonry layer behind the outermost plane of the fa- cade. Perret's trumeau divided the bay of the giant order into two bays on next layer be- hind the columns. In using the trumeau, Perret allowed the constructional and com- positional nuances of the masonry precedent to resonate. In the museum, the first-floor win- dows were not detailed as windows in a masonry wall, but as horizontal ribbon win- dows that extended up to the roof. The col- umns, not the walls, carry the roof. It is sig- nificant that Perret oriented the windows vertically rather than horizontally. In debat- ing Le Corbusier, Perret vehemently pro- moted the vertical window as superior and more correct than the horizontal format be- cause of its anthropomorphic character.33 The vertical window framed the viewer and the viewer's position relative to the land- scape being viewed, not the expanse of the horizon beyond the enclosure. On the facade in front of the first- floor level, just below the ribbon window, the spandrel element was treated as a band that could "slide" up and down the build- ing, almost like a window shade. This band is similar to elements in the same position in the H6tel Lamoignan (Paris)34 and in Vaux- le-Vicomte. In the H6tel Lamoignan, the band of stone "balconies" and their atten- dant frames are joined to create a secondary frame that appears to slip behind the giant order. At Vaux-le-Vicomte, there is an enta- blature that appears to have slipped down behind the giant order. At the bottom of the spandrel element, Perret designed a concrete "shade pull": a whimsical device that further emphasizes the illusion of mobility. Despite the visual evidence on the facade that points to an earthbound, masonry wall/frame con- dition, there is yet another interpretation of the wall that coincides with the role of the ribbon window: Perret's "sliding" panel ful- 1 49 Gardner</page><page sequence="11">"M/i.,r,'t , U'M .TRAVAuX P'ULtC3 TPAVAUX PDULIC5 . ..... .... 57 " 18. Musee des Travaux Publics, axonometric. (Courtesy of Archives d'Architecture du XXe sibcle de I'Institut Francais d'Architecture.) fills the promise of a wall fully disengaged from the structure that the ribbon window implies. The tectonic logic of the building clarifies the intent of those oscillating, con- flicting conditions described earlier (Figure 18). Construction documents for the mu- seum indicate that the window jambs of sec- ondary frame on the facade also acted as columns that support the ground and first floors. These elements fall within Alberti's structural model in which the wall and col- umn are inextricable and interdependent; that is, elements that appear as structure on the facade are structure. They also fit within Damisch's interpretation of Alberti's model, previously cited, in which Damisch con- tends that "it is also certain that an opening, far from being necessarily prejudicial to the stability of the wall, may contribute to it, provided it is itself handled in accordance with Alberti's principle, and the jambs as- suming the role of columns, so that they become part of the skeleton."35 This secondary frame is part of the trumeau, whose identity is ambiguous. Structurally, it acts as a concrete frame. Representationally, it is a masonry wall. The ambiguity of the actual element parallels the ambiguity inherent in the eighteenth-cen- tury definition of trumeau. This ambiguity is a vestige of the tension between theories of wall and frame. However, the ambiguity in Perret's trumeau also suggests a curtain wall assembly. His detailing of the trumeau indicates that this building is monolithic and layered.36 Perret created shafts in the trumeau through which mechanical and electrical equipment could be run. This il- lustrates the potential for the development of a layered wall, in which structure and enclosure, and interior face and exterior face, are not coincident. This layering con- tributes to compositional and technical theories of the curtain wall.37 The tectonic logic of the building also depicts the cast-in-place columns of the log- gia as supporting the roof. Axonometric drawings found in the developmental draw- ings for the project reveal that the project was detailed as a building within a building. The inner building was a masonry building wherein the French masonry tradition was transformed by a method of concrete con- struction. Inside the inner building on the Avenue d'Ikna was a great hypostyle hall, which was built to be able to carry the heavy installations of the Musee des Travaux Pub- lics on the ground and first floors. The outer building was a temple that took the form of a giant concrete frame that gives the build- ing a monumental public presence. In addi- tion, as the outer building bridged the inner building, "the notion of the architecture joins that of the public works program."38 Perret placed a deep reveal at the soffit behind the columns, which allows the giant order columns of the outer building to be interpreted as further disengaged from the wall of the inner building (see Figure 17). The ribbon window acts as a visual gasket between the two buildings, and the window shade spandrel below amplifies the separation between the two buildings. The spatial strat- egy for the interior plan making of this build- ing, that of a free plan, is represented by the gasket of ribbon windows at the first floor. The independence of the two buildings pre- sented Perret with another opportunity in the development of concrete construction: It cre- ated logical locations for expansion joints. Because expansion is a primary cause of deg- radation and failure in a concrete structure, the ribbon window was the logical place to separate the two buildings. February 1997 JAE 50/3 1 50</page><page sequence="12">The Musee des Travaux Publics rep- resents a lexicon of traditions in French con- struction: the load-bearing masonry tradition, the primary and secondary ma- sonry frame, the digagement of the column and the wall, and the ribbon window. De- tails support the architectural role of any given element of the lexicon. The fact that details support the architectural role of any element is evident at many scales; from the scale of the parti to the scale of the detail. For example, Perret carefully placed precast concrete panel joints to indicate whether any given condition was expressive of load- bearing or masonry infill. At the ground floor, the joints allow the panels to be inter- preted as laid-up masonry, whereas at the spandrel of the first floor the joints are ver- tical. This vertical orientation, which sug- gests that the panel does not act in a load-bearing capacity but acts as a skin in- stead, is underscored by the existence of the shade pull. In fact, the pull is not a capri- cious addition to the facade. Rather, the wall section through the pull indicates that the hole in its center ventilates the air space between the exterior skin and interior sur- face of the wall, further emphasizing the non-load-bearing character of the panel. Other details similarly indicate tec- tonic intentions. At the first floor are large horizontally oriented ribbon windows, di- vided into square increments between mul- lions. At the ground floor, however, are double-hung windows. Although this is not a window type found particularly often in traditional French construction, it nonethe- less represents a type found in masonry load- bearing conditions. The tectonic logic of the double-hung window is in contrast with that of the ribbon window of the first floor. The choice of double-hung and ribbon windows highlights the contrasting tectonic readings of load-bearing and non-load-bearing wall types. In addition to the handling of the windows, the creation and assembly of the concrete elements in this building also tend to support the architectural role represented. The concrete was formed and detailed in a variety of ways-as if it were representing stone, wood, or a plastic material. What it was to represent and, by extension, how it was formed and detailed depended on the architectural program of the context: load- bearing wall, frame, or free facade. Perret's detailing of the trumeau exem- plifies the collision between wall-based and frame-based theories of architecture. Since Viollet-le-Duc, "we tend to view structure in terms of the frame and articulate discontinu- ous systems."39 In his use of the trumeau and its transformation through concrete con- struction, in a paradoxical way Perret re- solved and continued the tension between the wall and the frame. The solution not only parallels Alberti's structural model of conti- nuity, but also further develops the disconti- nuity inherent in a curtain wall assembly. Contradictions and the State of the French Rationalist Debate "Ambiguities" in Perret's work can also be interpreted as contradictions. The nomen- clature that revealed the concept of the trumeau as the root form of a facade element is one contradiction. The possibility that the building could be identified as both mono- lithic and layered is another. The fact that the section of the exterior wall between the base and the first floor ribbon window may be simultaneously analyzed as part of the representation of a load-bearing tradition and understood as a wall disengaged from the primary structural frame is another con- tradiction. The coexistence of ribbon and double-hung windows is yet another. Simi- larly, Perret's studies of the facade demon- strate the range of expression and tectonic resolution that he considered for the exte- rior enclosure. These contemporaneous studies resonate with a range of formal and technical expressions from Louis M&amp;t&amp;zeau's H6tel Lamoignan to Claude Perrault's col- onnade for the Louvre to Pierre-Frangoise- Henri Labrouste's Bibliotheque St. Genevieve to Le Corbusier's free facade (Figure 19). The contradictions that lurk in the museum indicate Perret's complicity in the evolution of French architectural tradi- tions: invention within convention, conven- tion within invention. These contradictions also represent aspects of the debate between Perret and Le Corbusier during the twenties and thirties. Perret argued against the avant-garde and the international rationalist architecture charac- terized by the work of Le Corbusier. In De- cember 1923, he gave an interview published in the daily Paris-Journal this particular is- sue was dedicated to an overview of new ten- dencies of French architecture presented at the Salon d'Automne. Gargiani observes that Perret "criticizes the formal orientation of the new architecture and attacks in particu- lar Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier, defining the latter as the ultimate 'student' of a school of 'paper architecture.' The interview marked the beginning of the polemic be- tween Perret and Le Corbusier, which con- tinued well into the 1930s, and was centered on the role of the structure in the formal characterization of architecture, on the form of the window, on the cornice, and on the materials of construction.'40 In the thirties, the French cultural debate also turned on the issues of the representation of the human fig- ure in architecture, focusing in addition on themes of classicism, modernity, ornament, and "nudity" of the surface. Again, a princi- pal figure in this debate, Perret espoused rep- resentational traditions of the structure and the surface that supported the goals of the latest "neo-Humanism."41 1 51 Gardner</page><page sequence="13">1 - H M ? ii 1 illll CI 11? 1~~ ~ ~ ? I 19. Musee des Travaux Publics, details from facade studies. (Courtesy of Archives d'Architecture du XXe siecle de I'Institut Francais d'Architecture.) Indeed, questions regarding the sur- face were central to these debates. As op- posed to the proponents of the International Style movement, for whom the facade was abstract, "nude," and a skin to cover the plastic manipulations of pure geometric volumes, Perret believed in the representational possibilities implicit in a trabeated structure. He also believed that to cover the ossature and remplissage was tanta- mount to a crime, and in the thirties he even renounced some of his work from ten and twenty years earlier in which he covered the facades with plaster. Perret attacked the use of enduit (covering) in terms of a logic of construction and representation; he ar- gued for a more durable material that could reflect regional characteristics. With regard to the Musee des Travaux Publics, "There is not one sack of plaster here," he proudly de- clared.42 Perret said that "thanks to stucco, the aesthetes churn out untruthful designs," and "for that which concerns the exterior, the stucco under no matter what form should only be utilized as a last resort, and should even be forbidden. It is too tempting for the bad builder to disguise, with the aide of this means, a badly studied structural framework, made barely 'in order that it stand' and infilled with badly chosen mate- rials. But a stucco covering constitutes monolithic surfaces, carried by other sur- faces that do not have the same coefficient of expansion. So, following differences of temperature, fissures are produced and will betray, in a random way, in a badly studied structural framework. By the same effect, this stucco, inevitably faienced, that is to say that it will be cut with innumerable capil- lary fissures, through which the rain will penetrate; when below freezing, it will blis- ter and fall. This is the inconvenience of large bare surfaces."43 For Perret, the idea of stone was criti- cal for the surface of the enclosing wall. In February 1997 JAE 50/3 1 52</page><page sequence="14">stone, one expresses the tradition of a grande charpenterie, which in Perret's terms was the very definition of architecture. In concrete, the tradition could be made more durable, economical, more heroic, and thus more beautiful. Regarding the Siege du Garde Meuble, Perret explained that "I do not use cladding materials of which the usage has al- ways been demonstrated to be precarious. The Greeks never did it. The concrete is self- sufficient. The concrete is stone that we fab- ricate much more beautifully and in a much more noble manner than natural stone. It is necessary to honor it by highlighting it. One can work it with a hammer, one can bushhammer it, one can cut it, one lays it with all the implements that serve to bring the stone to life."44 Joseph Abram observed that the Musde des Travaux Publics is a hom- age to stone, rendered in concrete, treated with all the regard given to stone. The pieces of concrete were even put in place with the same precautions as pierre tailld, and even the handling of the joint between different pan- els revealed a significance. Abram concludes that the conception of the museum as a "monument parfait" in stone was realized to the most intimate of material detail.45 Perret's polemical position regarding the surface was not based solely on ques- tions of a rationalized construction process. Perret wanted to create French modern ar- chitecture, not an abstract international ar- chitecture.46 In Perret's polemic, the very definition of a French modern architecture is created within the logical construct of a masonry tradition translated into the me- dium of reinforced concrete construction. This position, supported by many artists and journalists in the debate, was poignantly demonstrated in Marcel Mayer's article in l'Art et les Artistes in 1936 entitled "Le Gentil Esprit Frangais: Meditations Architecturales." In this allegory, Mayer weaves a tale in which Auguste Perret makes an automobile voyage to Chateau Anet. At Anet, Perret is warmly greeted by the spirit of Philibert de l'Orme, architect of Anet. For de l'Orme, the vision of Anet "suffices, in effect, to bear witness to one of my great- est worries: to make French architecture. This worry, I know, is yours as well, and I do not ignore how you oppose the gentle French spirit against the tendency towards impersonality, towards the 'international- ization of taste,' which certain bad masons propagate."47 Later in their conversation, de l'Orme confesses to Perret that "the rein- forced concrete amazes me. It resolves the problem closest to my heart: to build well, economically. How it leaves far behind my beautiful inventions in carpentry, my stone vaulted staircases, and others of note."'48 Perret and de l'Orme continued their dis- cussion, arguing against other aspects of the International Style. In summoning Philibert de l'Orme to bless Perret's position, Mayer illustrates the tie that binds a French archi- tectural tradition, masonry construction, and Perret's work. Perret's insistence on the establish- ment of a French modern architecture also bears a relationship to certain aspects of the general cultural climate in the thirties through the fifties. Faithful to methods em- ployed in stone construction, Perret ap- proached the use of concrete in a manner that both dovetailed with and diverged from the economic needs of France in 1932. Perret was interested in aspects of labor that involved the alliance between stone and concrete: labor of the hand, standardization, and prefabrication. Perret refined the con- crete surfaces at the Mus&amp;e des Travaux Publics to a degree that remains unequaled in his subsequent work, and his method of working concrete is labor-intensive. Only with a trained and highly skilled labor force could he achieve the control of admixtures for color, choice of aggregate, carefully crafted form work, bushhammering by hand, washing, brushing, the careful mak- ing of the joint, and especially the method of making corners of panels through a sepa- rate mix of concrete and a mold to be ap- plied and hand finished. In the twenties, concrete received much attention for its po- tential universality. In the thirties, during the rationalist debates, Perret espoused the use of a regionalized concrete. To be re- gional, concrete would have to replace or be treated as stone. In translating the metier of the stonemason to that of the "concrete mason," Perret encouraged the employment of skilled craftsmen, which was both good for the economy and sustained the lineage of master craftsmen. Although Perret's approach spurred the economy in some ways, his approach ran contrary to it in others. Gargiani points out that after World War II, urgent economic difficulties encountered in reconstruction constrained possibilities for concrete con- struction, but that nevertheless Perret, in his quest to create an identifiable French modern architecture, never abandoned his effort to exploit technical means to effect modalities in concrete surfaces. Gargiani notes that in the forties and fifties, at projects in Le Havre, Amiens, and at Saclay, the prevailing logic of prefabrication was imposed on the construc- tion site, impeding Perret's quest to evoke stone in concrete. Yet, until his death, Perret maintained his confidence in the expressive dimension that could be achieved by care- fully working concrete by hand rather than by electrically or pneumatically powered bushhammering. Gargiani summarized Perret's position: "Thus, even at the same moment when France and other countries showed an increasingly greater interest in re- search regarding prefabrication and industrial production of reinforced concrete structures, Perret's technique remains anchored in manual processes and in finishes that are 153 Gardner</page><page sequence="15">characteristic of the previous construction sites in stone.""49 In "Technique and the Metaphysics of Science," Marc Angelil distinguished be- tween two definitions of technique. The first has to do with the craftsman's ability to employ the particular skills for an art form, or techne. The second involves the body of specialized knowledge necessary for produc- tion. Angelil described the distinction be- tween the two definitions as follows: "The former definition is direct and active, engag- ing the maker with his means of produc- tion. The latter is distanced and general, assuming a certain objectivity for the sys- tematization of the field."50 Although transformed through inno- vation growing out of enhanced skill and knowledge gained through the process of working, techne nonetheless acquires the patina of convention through the passage of time and knowledge. It may be said that the second realm of technique includes inven- tion as a necessary component of the ad- vancement of specialized knowledge. Perret operated within both definitions. In Perret's oeuvre, techne is represented in his treatment of concrete, in which he continued a ma- sonry tectonic that resonates with a labor of the hand. The second definition of tech- nique is manifested in the sophistication of Perret's production and technical inven- tions. Like the absorption of new methods of production into extant formal and tech- nical theories, Perret's oeuvre was informed by convention and invention: convention in techne and invention in production.

As timber was dear, this technique demonstrated a method for join- ing small pieces of wood to span greater distances. 7. Jean-Marie Pdrouse de Montclos proposes that "Book IV is the keystone to the treaty .... Book IV is a monument of French architecture of the Re- naissance: from the spiral staircase of Saint-Gilles to the Romanesque and southern heritage, with vaults in the modern French manner it refers to the national Gothic tradition, it borrows from Italian perspective new methods of spatial representation; from all of the above, it creates a new technique, stereotomy, from which the success in France will be exceptional." Jean- Marie Perouse de Montclos, "Presentation," in Premier Tome de l'Architecture ([156] Paris: Laget, 1988), p. 9. P&amp;rouse de Montclos also observes, "The em- pirical development of the medieval art of stereotomy left very little written traces. Philibert's pretension of being its inventor is not inaccurate, if one understands that here the inventor is really an editor. Philibert wouldn' have been able to translate this technique if he hadn't benefitted from the progress in perspectival drawing.... Finally, he gives to stereotomy the stat- ure of a major technique that it maintains in French theory. It is only in perfectly mastering this technique that one can systematize the plan of the "old [medieval] chMteau." Thus, stereotomy appears as a clever inven- tion that permits one to make as new with the old, at the same time that it appears as the holy grail on which the transformation is made from the null Middle Ages to a triumphant Renaissance."

Another reason masonry walls tended to be very permeable is that glazed areas of buildings were very large due to a tax on the number of windows from approximately 1600 to 1938. 10. Peter Smith commented regarding Blois: "In contrast with the arrangement of corner pilasters usually to be found in French buildings at that time, Mansart here moves the end pilasters right to the ex- tremities of the fagades so that they themselves become the corners of the building. This treatment was fre- quently adopted in Italy and had already made its ap- pearance in France, at Ancy-le-Franc for example ... Mansart was apparently well prepared to pay [a] price for a system which not only gives greater definition of the building masses, but also imparts new meaning to the pilasters, for when the end pilasters are moved to the corners they produce what appears to be a square pier with two faces exposed and two partially hidden in the wall. This by implication suggests that all the remaining pilasters are in face square piers embedded in the wall and only partly visible, rather than mere undulations in the wall surface or applied ornament."

Damisch further comments, "Long before other contemporary engineers, Alberti recognized that in spite of its monolithic and regular appearance, the wall of Hadrian's Pantheon was itself articulated by a network of superimposed brick arches in the mass of the masonry .... For the Albertian skeleton is not nec- essarily, nor even principally, made up of elements sunk in the wall: it is a reinforcement of the wall, a reinforcement which can, if required, be external to it so that the applied order has its contribution to make to the stability of the whole, while at the same time fulfilling its own function which is to support the rib elements of the roof."

Monolithic and layered are herein used ac- cording to Edward Ford's definitions in his descrip- tions of theories of construction in Details ofModern Architecture. 37. Le Corbusier's polemic of the Five Points of Architecture included the concept of the free facade. However, although many of his buildings have compo- sitionally "free" facades with ribbon windows that in- dicate the wall is not load-bearing, the construction of the wall and the relationship of the wall to the floor are within masonry traditions. They are traditionally laid up concrete block masonry walls that sit on the floor. The wall is not liberated from the structure. Perret's model introduced the technics of a layered system.

"[Perret] told him angrily that he would no longer tolerate that my works be reproduced; that I destroy the correct French tradition." In 1926, Perret severed his relationship to lArchitecture vivante. Le Corbusier made this observation during Perret's con- versation with Albert Moranc&amp;, editor of the journal.
