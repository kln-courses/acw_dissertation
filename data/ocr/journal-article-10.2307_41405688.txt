<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Dual Function of Narrative in a Child's Writing Valjeane M. Olenn From early in elementary school on through high school, teachers devote a great deal of time to teaching students to write research papers. One of the universal problems in having students write such papers is getting them to write in their own words rather than copy. Because writing in the content areas is such an important issue for so many teachers, it is with particular interest that one looks at what happened in a fourth grade classroom where the children engaged in research projects that took well over a month to complete and which resulted in particularly vivid writing. All of the data on which this article is based were collected by Lucy McCormick Calkins in 1979-1980 at Atkinson Academy, Atkinson, New Hampshire. Calkins' data are in the form of verbatim scripts of interviews, videotapes, and copies of the children's writing. Background Since the beginning of the third grade, many of the children in Carolyn Currier's fourth grade classroom had been in classes which emphasized the writing process. The children wrote every day, chose their own subjects, had conferences with the teacher and with other students, drafted and redrafted pieces of writing to craft them, and even published some of their completed work. The children's engage- ment in writing was constant, eager, and highly social. Writing was for these youngsters an important part of their daily experience. Currier's aim with the research project she had her students take up in March was to move the children into concentrated writing in the content areas, more objective writing than the personal writing they had been doing. The research experience was not a uni- versally smooth one. Most of the children experienced frustration at some time or other, some even abandoned their efforts for a few days here and there; early on, none seemed to think that this writing was as interesting as personal writing. In the end, though, most felt positive about the experience and had produced well- written pieces from their research efforts. Two aspects of the experiences seem to have been particularly important to the success the children experienced in their research writing. One was that before the children really began writing, Currier had them review their notes and then pair up to "teach" each other about their topics. This step in the process revealed to some children where they had gaps in their information. For all the children who participated in this step, the exercise seemed to show them that the information they had gathered was theirs, that they had the words to express it, thus freeing 376 Language Arts , Volume 61, Number 4, April 1984</page><page sequence="2">The Dual Function of Narrative in a Child's Writing them to write in their own words. A second aspect of the experience was that while the children were given instruction in such areas as library work and note- taking, and while they knew that they were to have a proper bibliography at the end of their piece, they were left free to work out the form of the piece itself. The written pieces grew from what the children had learned in doing the research, an aspect of the assignment that, given the success of the pieces, demonstrates how natural a part of their writing experience research writing can be. One case study in particular, that of Brian, can show us what happens when the heuristic of narrative is allowed to function in a child's writing. While Brian was certainly not among the least skillful writers in the class, neither was he one of the best. He had begun the year with some definite problems in writing, but he also had some definite strengths. Among those strengths, as Calkins noted, was "an especially good sense of a story." The narrative that Brian designed as his research piece allowed him both to absorb information and to demonstrate what he had learned. Simultaneously, the narrative enabled Brian to transfer the writing process from his personal writing to informative writing. Plagiarism In his first attempt to do the research assignment, Brian had copied directly from an encyclopedia. Why did Brian copy and how did it come about that he finally was able to write in his own words? He copied because the topic he had chosen - railroads in New Hampshire - was too broad. More important, he copied because he was trying to write about something outside of his own experience. Because the topic was something far from his own experience, Brian could not question, organize, or even absorb the information he came across in reading for the assignment. He had nothing to "hook" new information onto. Having nothing inside himself to write from, the child really had no choice but to copy. Requisites for Learning One of the requisites for learning is that the learner must attach new information to what he already knows. When Brian changed his topic, he changed to one that, in the general way of things, he already knew something about: the gray squirrel. Again and again, children tell us that choosing a good topic is crucial to turning out a good piece of writing. Their general definition of "good topic" seems to be (a) one you know enough about that you won't run out of material to draw from in writing and (b) one you care enough about that you won't run out of steam in developing the piece. In choosing a subject he already knew something about, Brian moved to a good topic. A second requisite for learning is that one must work with new information to make it one's own. In going through a number of research and pre-writing steps and in constructing his narrative, Brian played with information about the gray squirrel. He asked questions about the squirrel. He wrote down information in 377</page><page sequence="3">378 Language Arts categories, information he had read and selected for recording. He talked about his topic, engaging in frequent conferences with the teacher, other students, and the whole class. The conferences were times to talk about the topic and the piece, to ask and answer questions, to process or reprocess information. All of those research activities continued during the writing of the piece; thus, the piece itself functioned as the means by which Brian was able to seek out and absorb infor- mation. When Brian began to write, he had so progressed in making the research information his own that he was able to write out of himself, working through seven drafts, more redrafting than he had done in any previous piece of writing. He was able to re-form the information into something of his own. Narrative Vehicle Using the same criteria for selection and arrangement that he employed in doing his personal writing, Brian developed a first-person narrative about a boy's encounters with a gray squirrel. The story can be baldly summarized as: boy meets squirrel, boy befriends squirrel, boy and squirrel fall out. The story is organized in three chapters with three narrative elements providing the skeletal structure of each chapter, an event that serves as a device to create what is then the major conflict of the chapter and an attendant shift in the emotions expressed in the chapter. In developing that structure, Brian demonstrates how thoroughly he has acquired what Rosen calls "the story grammar of our society." Rosen's argument is that "narrative itself is a cognitive resource - a meaning-making strategy," (1982) a notion born out by Brian's research experience. Presenting Information Within his narrative Brian conveys information both by stating it and by implying it. For the purposes of this present paper, I consider information to be what Brian knew or learned about the gray squirrel that he wished to convey to the reader; narrative is what Brian designed to carry the information. Information is woven into the texture of the narrative as description; the research aspects of the piece are thus fully integrated with the narrative whole. In Chapter 1, Brian says, "That night I thought about that 15 1/2-inch squirrel, his bushy tail almost as long as the rest of his body ..." giving us accurate information about squirrels in general by couching it in terms of narrative description. Here Brian also demon- strates that he has extrapolated information. That the squirrel's tail is almost as long as its body was not a piece of information that he was given. Brian found out how long the body is and how long the tail is and realized for himself that the squirrel's tail is almost as long as the body. What could be a more wonderful demonstration of how the child has made the information his own? In Chapter 3, Brian says, "In all the pain I realized that squirrels sometimes carry rabies." This is a piece of information that Brian knew prior to doing the project. From very early in drafting his piece, Brian included that information, but in working on the fifth draft of the narrative he came to realize that he</page><page sequence="4">The Dual Function of Narrative in a Child's Writing did not know enough about rabies to work the information in properly. At that point, Brian went back to the library to do further research on rabies and then reworked the third chapter of his piece to reflect his new information. It is important to note that Brian learned much more about rabies than appears in his final piece. From his enlarged store of information, he selected what he needed for his narrative. Implying Information Considerable information is also implied in the narrative. In Chapter 1, when the boy first meets the squirrel, the animal is sitting in a nest surrounded by "nuts, seeds, fruits, and bird eggs." The reader can infer that squirrels live in nests and that the catalogue represents a listing of their diet. In Chapter 2, he says, "I saw a weasel fighting the squirrel ..." and a sentence later a cat and dog came along to ". . . gang up on the squirrel." It is left to the reader to infer that these three animals represent some of the squirrel's enemies. It is not by chance that that information is implied in the piece. In discussing his piece, Brian spoke of the need to show, rather than tell his reader what the squirrel's enemies are. As a writer, Brian trusts his reader's intelligence. Using Personal Experience An important aspect of Brian's research project was that he used his personal experience in crafting the narrative. He knew from experience that squirrels live in holes in trees. At one point in a conference he told of climbing a tree with his sister and finding in the tree a hole with acorns in it. The children knew that this must be the home of a squirrel, information that appears in the research piece. In describing the squirrel, Brian refers to the animal's "curious eyes," a detail that appears in every draft of the piece. Once again in an interview, Brian revealed that he had once seen a picture of a gray squirrel and thought that the eyes looked curious; now, in writing his narrative, he decided that that was good information to include. That he included this sort of information shows that Brian did have prior knowledge to "hook" new knowledge onto. More significantly, it shows that Brian confidently considered that personal knowledge valid. Intertwining Information and Narrative Brian's work on his narrative showed a complex pattern of moving among sources, notes, and drafts. He sought to embed information in a story that has a life of its own. All through the writing of this piece, Brian was constantly aware of the need to intertwine information and narrative. Before beginning his final draft, he looked over what he had written and said, "I don't know if it is too much story or not enough information," a critical question he could ask because he had a reservoir of unused information on the gray squirrel that he could tap if need be. The point here is that because he was developing a narrative piece of his own, rather than 379</page><page sequence="5">Language Arts simply acting as a conduit for information to flow from printed source to the teacher, the child was learning. The act of narrating became the act of learning. Examining the Drafts Overall, there was a steady increase in the total length of Brian's piece. As Brian developed his piece, the amount of text devoted to information decreased while the story content of the piece increased. Figure 1 illustrates the differences in the amount of information and the amount of story in each draft. In the first draft, for example, there are fifty-four words of information and ninety-six words of story. Taking a closer look at some things that happened in the drafting can amplify how this balance was achieved. The second draft, the shortest draft, is an aborted attempt at writing the piece from the squirrel's point of view. This stab at anthropomorphism was one that most of the children who wrote about animals tried. As with all the other children, Brian gave up the device. The significance of the attempt is that it indicates the freedom Brian felt in manipulating his material. The third and fourth drafts, especially the fourth draft, contain the most infor- mation because both of those drafts end with a long section in which Brian contrasts the ground squirrel and the red squirrel with the gray squirrel. In introducing this material on those other squirrels, Brian had strayed from his intention - to present information about the gray squirrel in a coherent, satisfying Figure I: Comparison of Words of Information with Words of Narrative 380</page><page sequence="6">The Dual Function of Narrative in a Child's Writing 381 narrative. For Brian an important criterion of good writing was having just one subject. Before writing the fifth draft, he excised the information about the other squirrels. It is important that in applying his rigorous standards to his research writing, Brian did what every good researcher must: he evaluated whether or not a piece of information was relevant to his purpose. However accurate a piece of information might be or however painstakingly acquired, if it did not advance the piece, Brian ruthlessly eliminated it. The fifth draft is where the narrative takes over. At that point, when the amount of information in the second half of the piece decreases, the total number of words in the piece increases. This development indicates that Brian had decided what information to have in the piece and where to place it and was now intent on working out the story itself. Transferring the Writing Process In writing his squirrel piece Brian used what he had learned in his personal writing about the writing process. Making the transfer to his research writing was, initially, difficult for Brian, as it was for most of the children in the room. Brian was not alone in copying his first attempt. When he worked with a good topic, many of the characteristics that had appeared earlier in his personal writing came into play in his research writing. He had learned to work descriptive details into a narrative, determining what to describe because it was important to the story. He had also learned the value of poetic license. In explaining how and why he amplified a bit of dialogue through some invention, he had said, "Sometimes you have to write a little more than what happened." Often he had asked his reader to draw inferences, and for some months he had been in command of the technique of showing, not telling. With those resources at his command, a year and a half of practice in the writing process under his belt, and a fund of information to work with, Brian made the transfer of the writing process to this new kind of writing. He even invented a new process step for himself. Rather than copy and recopy parts of the piece as he reordered his narrative and made changes between drafts, somewhere between the third and fourth drafts Brian cut the drafts up and taped together the bits he wanted from each. He wound up with a draft that was a long scroll of writing that flowed over the edge of his desk. This new cut-and-tape step was not one that other students had used (though at least one did seem to pick it up and use it after Brian did), but it is certainly consistent with the children's urge not to waste time. Inventing a new process step seems to be one sign that a child has made a breakthrough in writing. We can argue that Brian's ability to intertwine objective writing with inventive writing was a breakthrough. Conclusions Looking at a single piece of writing produced by a child allows us to see the dynamics at work in the development of that piece, a view of writing rarely</page><page sequence="7">382 Language Arts reported in research on the teaching of writing. There are a number of conclusions to be drawn from this case study of Brian's research piece, conclusions which have to do with the link between narrative writing and content area writing in a child's development. 1. Narrative allows children to absorb information. 2. In working on narratives, children enlarge their store of information, learning more than appears in the writing. 3. Constructing a narrative allows children to play with information, making it their own. 4. Constructing a narrative reveals to children where/ when more information is needed. 5. When the topic of research lies too far outside children's experience, they copy. 6. A good research topic is one children already know something about. 7. The transfer of the writing process from personal writing to objective writing in the content areas is facilitated by narrative. For the Teacher Children can learn content and skills by doing research projects. Children can transfer the writing process from one mode of writing to another. Children can use narrative as a synthesizing agent in learning. The question is, what can the teacher do to facilitate all of that? The teacher can allow children time: time to learn by acquiring and then using information, time to experiment in finding and using information, time to write and rewrite, time to make mistakes. Also, at the various stages in the research experience the teacher needs to provide the student with help. It is very important that all through the process the teacher use conferences to monitor the child's progress, to provide the child with directions, and to ask questions that will help stretch the child's thinking. Finally, the teacher has to value the writing mode the child evolves in dealing with new information in the content areas. When that mode is narration, the teacher must remove from narrative the onus of frivolity and see it for what it is: a cognitive resource for the child to use in learning. Reference Rosen, H.
