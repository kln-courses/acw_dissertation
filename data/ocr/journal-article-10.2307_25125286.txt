<plain_text><page sequence="1">by E.M. Broner Singing is everywhere on the island and off island. Today is one of those crisp days that come to the island at the end of August. Waves whip by. Trees change mid-crown, the shady part red, the sunny side green. This I saw on the road to the Laundromat. I also notice that the fishing boats are back early. All in harbor before noon. From the church up on the hill of my fish ing village comes the dirge. The fishermen entering the doors have changed from heavy boots and rain gear to church wear. They are thinking about the lessons of the sea. "Walk with Me, Jesus" comes through the opened doors. Friends and relatives of the drowned fish erman enter or cluster outside. The minister is describing the newly deceased, who had been a member of the American Legion Post of Elk Isle, on the Board of Directors of the Elk Isle Lobsterman's Co-op. His family surrounds him?except for the grandchil dren, who took themselves off to Bangor, an hour-and a-half away, but off-island, nonetheless. "If he'd only had a stern man," I hear one fisherman say. "The boat could have turned right around looking for him." "I hear they wasn't too much water in his lungs. Probably coulda been saved," says another. "These days, hard to afford two in a boat," says the first. My neighbor is related to everyone in the town. He is from one of the four island clans who own the granite quarry, the lobster pound, the trucks, the seafood restaurant, the gas station, and the land itself, from English charter days. An older fisherman joins them. "Probably got caught in the coil," he says, demonstrating, one foot in the air. "Threw the trap overboard." He hurls his arm out. This is the dread drama. "The coil of rope may-a caught his foot, and the weight of the trap drug him under." He just about falls on the gravel leading to the little wood en church. "They found him," another old-timer joins the group, "and that's something." "Yeah," says the dramatic fisherman. "They're fortu nate. They got someone to bury." The sheep on our meadow are munching the grass level. The ram is tethered behind the farm. Since becoming acquainted with these animals, I no longer characterize them as sheep-like. I had been upstairs when one of the herd caught its head in a water bucket. No matter how hard it tried to shake loose, the plastic pail remained fast. The other sheep galloped to the roadside bleating for motorists or joggers to stop. Motorists were startled but did not slow down. One jogger climbed the fence and knocked the bucket off with a branch. When the jogger headed back through the meadow to the road, the herd accompanied him, lining the fence in a chorus of gratitude and farewell. This is not anthropomorphic. I recently met the sheep lady down Beach Road, like me, a recent year-rounder. She raised her barn by her self, raised her daughter by herself, shears her sheep, cards the wool, spins and dyes it. The islanders are wearing wondrous shades of sweaters. You can tell her van on the road by her bumper sticker: SHEEP. 28 Septemberl991</page><page sequence="2">c/3 O ? i l The fishermen whisper about last spring when all the boats were hauled on land near the shipyard to be repaired and painted. "You old farts stand around swapping sea stories," says a young fisherman, who has dropped out of high school at sixteen and is making a bit of a living. Come winter, that bit will disappear. "I took my overweight and too-young lobsters down to New Hampshire to sell," says the same young man, showing off before his elders. "Not such strict rules down there." "Yeah," says an older guy, "and soon you'll fish the Bay clean of lobsters. Got to be rules." "Please yourself," says the cocky young man. A woman comes out and shoos the fishermen in. The hymnal is raised. Singing fills the Bay. Today the Russians depart, first for Washington DC, then for Leningrad. They have been in Maine for one month. Last night the governor, the Republican sena tor, the Democratic senator sent best wishes to the Leningrad People's Opera Company. The local select men also added a packet with a blueberry button and a potato button for the celebrated products of the state. "In Russia we do not spray," says one of the singers. "We are not allowed to poi son the crop." "That's why you're where you are," says a blueberry grower angrily, "and why we're where we are." Largely, the Company has been met with hospitality. They have been all over the causeway, the bridge, the island, the mainland. They have been seen in our ice cream parlor, our lobster eateries, on the sand beach sunning and in one of the sum mer people's fancy barns singing. Some of the Leningrad women have changed their hair style in the past month. They're leav ing with crimped blonde hair or wearing it skull-capped and shiny. This Leningrad singing society has become friendly with our own island singing society. Our chorus comes from the locals: sawyer, miller, farmer, receptionist at the Elk Isle hospital, two sisters who clerk in offices, and a veterinarian. The Russians are from comparable professions. Tonight is their final combined con cert. The American pianist and Russian accompanist nod to one another and com mence, while the Russian choirmaster con ducts a mixed chorus of Russians and Americans in Prince Igor. They are all jammed together on the stage of the barn. They can hardly lift their own scores, but read the music over one another's shoul der. A tenor has a solo. He cannot move from the crush of the crowd. He tries to raise his arm to identify himself as the owner of the voice. It is impossible. A wood-sprite, a Russian woman, sings romantic songs from Rimsky-Korsakoff, curtsying deeply as she finishes. We are in love with the Soviet Union this month. Our town is going to perform with them in Leningrad. All the churches, the Catholic Lady by the Sea, the Methodist, Baptist, the Latter Day Saints, are holding bazaars, rummage and bake sales to pay the way for our chorus. We vie to invite a Russian to dinner. We've all learned to say Spasibo. We know to embrace them after they sing. We are no longer surprised when their eyes fill with tears over the lyrics. We are surprised to find ourselves also crying. The sheep lady and other weavers on Elk Isle and the mainland are going to the Soviet Union to live on a sheep farm and see how the wool is carded and dyed. They will exchange information and songs. The sheep lady has a new bumper sticker: Fleece Peace. The island has lost a language today and a melody. My brother phones. "She is settling into a coma." September 1991 29</page><page sequence="3">N A R He has visited our mother in the nursing home. "She has received good care," he says, and tells me about a burly, mustached Chicano worker who tries to coax our mother to eat. "'Mama,' he said, 'Just a little soup, a little jello,' but she doesn't have the strength to sip through a straw," says my brother. Her body is disobedient to its training and its history. Eyes will not focus; legs refuse to stand; the heart will not do its job. For the past two weeks she has been wearing diapers. "They want to insert a tube through her nostril into her stomach," says my brother. "I told them, 'Nothing doing!'" My mother is sinking. We are allowing this to happen. "Her hands were twitching. She was wringing them," says my brother. "And I sat there and held them for an hour until she crossed them and slept." Only two weeks ago I drove from my island the hour and-forty-minute drive to Bangor. From there I flew to mother. Only two weeks ago she could still sing. I'm at her bedside. She's chilled; her teeth chatter. "Blankets," she calls, "More blankets." At ninety-eight dollars a day, at three thou a month, she should have an extra blanket. "Make a fire," she tells me. "There's no fireplace here, Mama." "I forget," says my mother. The fire reminds her of a camp song, one she used to sing at Camp Mechia. "An Indian name?" I ask. "Yiddish," says mother. "Camp Pleasure." Arum dem fay her Mirzingen lider "What's that?" I interrupt. Around the fire we're singing songs the night's so beautiful no one tires. "It doesn't really rhyme," I say. "It doesn't have to in English," says my mother. "It has to in Yiddish." "Nice song," I say. "I used to have a good voice," says my mother. I think I didn't know that. She breathes heavily. Water in her lungs. The nurse comes to check blood sugar. On top of all her other medical problems, she's newly developed dia betes. She has two insulin shots a day. "How long should we do this to her?" asks my brother when we meet later. Now my mother turns towards me. "Campfire days," says Mama drowsily. Arum dem fay er mirfrelekch tantsn. "What did you sing, Mama?" "I was more thinking," says my mother, "that we, around the fire, were dancing so lively." I suddenly want to know everything she remembers. "Take this down," says Mama. I pick up a notebook I always carry. "A recipe," says Mama. "What's my best?" "Stuffed cabbage," I say. "Olipses," says Mama. "Sit me up. I can't remember when I lie flat. The thoughts run out of the top of the head." I crank her up. She remembers Stuffed Cabbage: Cook cabbage, not too soft. Cool 1 lb. meat to head of cabbage Add salt and pepper to taste also: saut? 1 large onion small can mushrooms raisins She pauses, breathing heavily. An aide pokes her head in. "Mamacita," she says, "how about a little oxygen for dessert?" Mama, with the tube in her nostrils, continues. "Did I say salt and pepper? Onion? Raisins? Now, mix together." Fold mixture inside cabbage Add one large can tomatoes Lemon and sugar to taste Add water to pot to cover mixture Cook until meat is done by testing with fork. She leans back. "Did I say lemon? Did I say sugar?" I nod. "So, that's Olipsesr I repeat her recipe back to her. She listens and nods her head. "Now, Meat Borscht," I say. "First, tuna salad," she says, "the kind you and your brother loved as children." "I know how to make tuna salad," I say. "Who's supposed to talk, and who's supposed to lis ten?" asks my mother. Tuna Celery 1 hard boiled egg mayonnaise sweet pickles 30 September 1991</page><page sequence="4">E. M. B R O N E R "That's the trick," says mother, "sweet pickles." "Nobody eats mayonnaise, Mother," I say. "Cholesterol." "So eat it dry," says my mother. "It's your funeral." I pause a moment. "How about yogurt instead?" I ask. "How about mayonnaise half and yogurt half, and it's a deal," says my mother. "Now the Meat Borscht," I say. "I'm tired," says Mama. "While I'm on the IV, I don't like to think of food." She begins to doze on one elbow. She's sleeping on my visiting time, my trip in from Maine. "Tell me more, Mama," I say. "Sha, Sha," says Mama. With her eyes closed she sings: Sha, shtil! Macht nischt keyn gerider Der rebbe gyt shoyn tantsn vider. "That's a song I'll never get to sing at your wedding," she says, harping on an old topic. "It means: Sha shtil Don't make a sound. The rabbi's going to Dance around." She leans back. "With nothing else working, at least I'm not a shtimme, deaf and dumb." We sit quietly. She begins to sleep. Her mouth drops open. She frowns deeply, then awakens with a start. "What is it, Mama?" "I forgot to give you my Russian Beef Borscht. Meat bones. Go to the butcher and get meat bones." "Nobody goes to the butcher, Mama," I say. "So don't make Meat Borscht," she says. "O.K. Tell me. I'll go." She draws a breath. Meat bones with a little meat attached potato raw onion whole carrots whole fresh beets Wash beets, grate them. "With the leaves?" I ask. "Some do. I don't," says Mama. "No leaves if you want my Meat Borscht. Salt, pepper, sugar Can of tomatoes Cook together. "Anything else?" I ask. "If you got lima beans, also add." "And then?" I ask. "Then you got borscht." She wants to slip away into sleep. "Any more recipes? Any more songs? Did you sing me lullabies?" "No," said Mother. "In Russia, lullabies were too sad. All about a widow singing her heart out that her little baby would be fated to wander the earth. Who needed it? Also, I came here, married, was left alone and who do you think went out into the world to feed you two? I should work all day and sing lullabies by night? That's all I had to do." "You mean, you didn't sing to us, tuck us in, kiss us nighty-night?" I ask, only half in jest. "I had three hands," says mother sarcastically, "So I could do everything. Anyway, in those songs, first you tell the baby his misfortune, then you tell him to go to sleep. That's why Jewish children are so serious." "But we,'re serious without being lullabied," I say. "You try to do a better job," says mother. She hums. "Here's one, just to make sure the baby becomes a revolutionary in the cradle:" Schlof mayn kind schlof kesyder zingen vill ich dir a lid. " My mother smiles and reaches out to me. She has her arm around my shoulder: Sleep my child Sleep safe While I sing you a song. "It's safe so far," smiles my mother. "Soon, you'll see how it makes for a Red baby:" Die tayrstpalats Die shenste hayzer dos alts macht der orimen The beautiful palaces the gorgeous houses who makes them? the workingman. Who lives in them? Only the rich." "So why are you surprised that I don't live in a palace?" I ask. "Everything surprises," says my mother. "No hus band, no children. Selfishness prevails. You never took the time to have a little one." This is an old argument. We have never talked about my life. She removes her arm from my shoulder. "How does the song end?" I say. September 1991 31</page><page sequence="5">N A R The poor man lies in the cellar where it's cold and damp and he gets sick all over but the rich in his palace lives in health. "That's how it goes?" I ask. "More or less," says Mama. "It's not an exact recipe." "But, Mama," I say, "the rich get sick too. There are well-to-do people in here with you." "Don't be foolish, girl," says my mother. "How many poor people live until my age? Getting old is also a priv ilege of those who can afford it." She lies back. Her hands begin to jerk. Her frown reappears. "What about love songs, Ma?" I ask. I am relentless. I want her to stay. "What's your need?" says Mama. "You suddenly met somebody?" She wouldn't approve if I did. "Anyway," she says, "from a Russian Jew, a love song is also a bitter song. Also with castles and palaces, and one of them will marry rich and the other lover will remain in the cold, shivering like a leaf in winter." "It's a good thing I never married," I tease my mother. "Well, then you won't have to worry what to sing about," she says. We, her descendants, have not given her sufficient cause for song, her daughter a lesbian, her son divorced. Her life has exhausted her. Her sleep is too deep. A hand jerks. Her other reaches to calm it. "Sh, sh, M?male" I croon. I lullaby her until her frown disappears and the pair of hands nestle in each other. "No invasive measure," my brother is checking with me by phone upon my return to Maine. "Right?" A long hesitation. "Right," I say. "That's what we agreed," my brother reminds me. A cort?ge of cars is going by on its way to the Mariners' cemetery. The mariners include the young lost at sea, at the ages of fourteen and sixteen, as well as our neighbor, at fifty-seven. The drowned of two cen turies are commemorated. "I've given the Nursing Home the telephone number of the mortuary," says my brother. I do not comment. He is more efficient than I. "I'm not the villain in this," says my brother. "We don't want her to be agitated. Right? And not to be in pain?" "Yes," I say. He is usually correct. But does that mean we loosen our grip? We don't wrestle so fiercely with the Angel? Does that mean we speak of her in the past tense to get used to the sound of it? Does that mean, if water fills the lungs, we don't increase the dosage of heart medicine? If her sugar is high, we stop injections? "Don't be silly," says my brother. This long-distance call is more silence than talking. "I read to her tonight," says my brother. "I don't know if she heard, but I read the whole Jewish News to her, column by column." "Good," I say. If one is sinking under water, can one still hear the motor? "She seemed a little restless," says my brother, "so I sang to her." "You did?" I'm startled. "What song?" "A Yiddish song," my brother says. "But you don't know Yiddish," I say. "I took lessons," says my brother. "How come?" "What you're not given, you take," he says. "How did it go?" I ask. "The song?" he laughs. Unlike me, he can carry a tune. I can carry a cord of wood. I can carry my own weight, but not a melody. I had never heard his singing voice. Even over the phone I'm moved. "Do you understand the meaning?" I ask. "Oh, it's a folk tale, about an old fisherman who went to sea, dreaming on the sea, and he dreamt of fish and love, and he ends up getting neither fish nor love." I'm silent. Out of my bay window is the Bay. I no longer dream of fish or love. "Come by, sometime," I say. "That could be," he tells me. There will be only the two of us. Somebody has to sing to me. On the bus to Washington, the Russians will be singing, the basso with the wide tie and wide forehead, the tenor with the dimple in his chin, the romantic soprano with her Rimsky-Korsakoff. It is impossible that the Russians won't sing. They have their scores with them. They have their memories and melodies. Somewhere, high over the hill at the end of the road, over the caravan to Washington, above the pink stuc coed nursing home, the songs will braid together. The Autumn light on the water flips, flecks like minnows. D 32 September 1991</page></plain_text>
