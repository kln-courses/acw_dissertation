<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ULTIMACY OF NATURE: AN ESSAY ON PHYSIDICY Donald A. Crosby / Colorado State University Can nature be an appropriate object of religious concern when it is conceived non-theistically, that is, as not associated with or related to a God (or gods) of any sort? Thomas Aquinas answered this question in the negative, asserting that nature is an aggregation of contingent beings and therefore itself wholly contingent, depending for its existence moment by moment on a Necessary Being (God) that is its final explanation and ground. Since God alone is ultimate, in the sense of being the source and sustainer of all else that is?including the totality of the system of nature?only God can be the appropriate focus of religious faith. As important as this familiar challenge to the religious ultimacy of nature is, I do not intend to discuss it here.1 Instead, I want to respond to another basic objection to faith in the ultimacy of nature, one that focuses on a more explicitly valuative connotation of the term "ultimate" and turns on a particular problem of evil. I say "a particular problem of evil," because I have in mind something different from the traditional theological problem of evil. That problem, you will recall, goes something like this: why should there be so much evil in the world, or even any evil in it at all, if the God believed to have created the world is also assumed to be all-good and all-powerful? The conventional name for approaches to that problem is "theodicy," meaning endeavors to vindicate faith in the justice {dike) of such a God (theos) in the face of the existence of evil. The enterprise to be developed here could be called "physidicy," a coined term for attempts to defend or justify commitment to the religious ultimacy of nature {physis) in the face of such presumed problems as nature's pervasive wastefulness and cruelty, as well as its cold indifference to the anxieties and sufferings? say nothing of the deepest aspirations and values?of human beings. Friedrich Nietzsche alluded to these problems when he ridiculed the ancient Stoics for insisting that humans ought to live in accordance with nature: Imagine a behg like nature, wasteful beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without purposes and consideration, without mercy and justice, fertile and desolate and uncertain at the same 1. In another essay, where I recount some stages of my own journey from Christian theism to a religion of nature, I respond briefly to this line of argument against the latter. See "From God to Nature: A Personal Odyssey," Religious Humanism 25 (1991 ): 107-16, esp. 113-114. An adequate response would, of course, require much more detailed discussion.</page><page sequence="2">302 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy time; imagine indifference itself as a power?how could you live according to this indifference?2 Nietzsche's description of nature radically impugns the reasonableness of a religion of nature, at least so far as the usual sense of the term "religion" is concerned. Alfred North Whitehead characterized religious intuition as discernment of "a character of permanent Tightness" inherent "in the nature of things."3 John E. Smith contended that all religious traditions exemplify a common tripartite structure: an Ideal defining the ultimate ground and goal of all existence; a sense of Need that "forces us to acknowledge . . . some deep seated obstacle that stands between us as we naturally exist and the attainment of the Ideal"; and a Deliverer (or means of deliverance) that affords insight and power required to move from the Need or flawed state toward the Ideal.4 And Rudolf Otto observed that "[t]o speak of a 'religion of redemption' is ... to be guilty of a redundancy, at any rate if we are considering the more highly developed forms of religion."5 If what these three thinkers assert about the character of religious sensibility and traits of developed religions is correct, as I think it is, then we can put the issue of physidicy in this way: can nature itself, as a putative object of religious concern, be plausibly regarded as inherently right, ideal, and redemptive, that is, as embodying the ground and goal of existence and providing insight, challenge, and power for transformation of human life in the direction of that goal? Unless this question can be answered affirmatively and convincingly, a case will not have been made for nature's being a fit object of religious concern. The assumptions about nature noted toward the end of the second paragraph of this essay imply that the question cannot be given an affirmative answer. But I am convinced that it can. The rest of this discussion will be devoted to criticizing these assumptions in light of an alternative vision of nature, and to countering the probing doubts they raise about the cogency of affirming its religious ultimacy. 2.

The Alleged Wastefulness of Nature The first assumption is that nature is unfit to be an object of religious concern because of its rampant wastefulness. Nature, so the charge runs, carelessly and routinely squanders life forms, species, and ecosystems. The female Chinook salmon lays about five thousand eggs. Approximately four thousand of these will hatch, and about four hundred will survive predators and other hazards to reach the ocean. A paltry four from that number is likely to live to return to the parent stream for spawning.6 Lung worms fatally infect herds of bighorn sheep, and prairie dogs are decimated by plague. A numbat lays waste a whole community of termites with a few swipes of its claws. Spruce and pine forests are attacked by beetles that burrow under the bark of trees, eventually killing them. Flood, fire, or lava flow ravages delicately interdependent systems of plants and animals built up over centuries. About ninety-eight percent of all biological species evolved since the onset of life on earth have now become extinct because of natural causes. And yet, nature continues to churn out new ones, almost all of these also headed for the dumping ground of eventual extinction. As Stephen Jay Gould comments, biological evolution is "a massively chancy and basically destructive process," one that "must lead to a lot of dead ends, as does any branching mechanism in our largely random world."7 Insects constitute about three-fourths of the total number of species of life on the earth. Pondering the staggering variety of their kinds, Annie Dillard was struck with the image of a nature that is "above all, profligate": Extravagance! This is what the sign of the insects says. No form is too gruesome, no behavior too grotesque. If you're dealing with organic compounds, then let them combine. If it works, if it quickens, set it clacking in the grass; there's always room for one more.8 And because each new species of clacking, voracious insects must eat to survive, its advent requires that some already established form or forms of life become its prey and perhaps even become extinct by losing out to the competitive pressure imposed by the new form of life. 6.

Everywhere there is devastation, superfluity, and disregard. Nature's ways are those of the prodigal, recklessly dissipating the wealth entrusted to its care. There is little here to be honored or admired, and certainly nothing worthy of religious veneration! This picture of an improvident, rash, and wasteful nature can be criticized, however, in a number of ways. First, it is a matter of perspective what counts as waste and what counts as gain. Waste for the young salmon and termites is gain for the hungry merganser or numbat. Second, despite the severe depletion of living beings by natural processes in the case of the Chinook salmon, enough survive to continue the species from year to year, and a f ine balance of predator and prey is maintained. Third, pr?dation and disease may help to weed out the less fit in a population or to select for more adaptable mutants, thus ensuring the continuing viability of a species' gene pool. Fourth, the devastation of one ecosystem may pave the way for the development of another. Fifth, the irrepressible fecundity of nature need not be seen as mere wasteful superfluity but can be viewed as creative upthrust and ongoing experimentation, working by a continuous process of trial-and-error to produce the panoplied history of biological evolution. Sixth, the extinction of some species, such as those of the ancient dinosaurs, can make room for the thriving or emergence of others, such as the various species of mammals (including us). Seventh, species may endure for millions of years, despite their eventually becoming extinct. They need not endure forever to be of significance and value. And eighth and most important, little in nature is really wasted. Almost everything is recycled. One of the prices of that recycling, of course, is the suffering and death of sentient creatures. Is it not too high a price? Does not the profusion of pain and death in nature?by routine behaviors that sometimes seem unbearably gruesome to us?radically disqualify it as a fit object of religious concern, making it an emblem of evil rather than good, of wanton horror rather than redemptive lightness? In the next section I first sketch a case for this negative conclusion about the feasiblity of a religion of nature and then present arguments for a more positive view. II. The Alleged Cruelty of Nature A "Far Side" cartoon, by Gary Larson, has a portly, robed, sandled, bespeckled, and bald-pated but otherwise flowingly hirsute God standing before an array of newly created animals, who face him in male and female pairs. He says, "Hmmmmm ... not bad, not bad at all. . . . Well, now I</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 14, No. 3, September 1993 305 guess I'd better make some things to eat you guys."9 There is, of course, no God in the religion of nature under discussion, but the implication of pervasive cruelty in nature remains as a fundamental indictment against any claim to its religious ultimacy. Life in nature, as Dillard puts it, appears to be "a universal chomp."10 What is any insect or animal, after all, but dinner on the hoof for other insects or animals?a handy packet of much needed protein? The lion fells the fleeing gazelle, tearing into its neck with powerful jaws. The blue fox preys on the arctic hare, and the arctic skua conveys a steady diet of insects and lemmings to the eager beaks of its young. The stalking heron lifts a thrashing fish from a lake and proceeds to swallow it whole. The scorpion dispatches a toad with a thrust of its poison-tipped tail. Even plants may sometimes be victors, and not mere victims, in the universal system of kill-or-be-killed. The Neem tree of India and Burma, for example, defends itself against insect pests with a substance (azadirachtin) that resembles a molting harmone in the gypsy moth caterpillar. Having ingested the substance by feeding on the tree, the caterpillar fails to produce enough of its molting harmone to metamorphose; hence, it dies.11 Grisly acts of cannibalism, though relatively rare in nature, do regularly occur in some species. To cite a well known example, the female preying mantis not infrequently chomps off the head of the male who mates with her. His decapitated trunk, in the meantime, may continue its mating pulsations atop her body as she turns her head back and calmly consumes it.12 Richard Dawkins notes another example of routine cannibalism, in the behavior of blackheaded gulls. They nest in large colonies, with the nests close together. When a neighbor's back is turned or when it is off fishing to bring back food for its young, an adult gull may grab one of the neighbor's newly hatched chicks and swallow it. The adult "thereby obtains a good nutritious meal," Dawkins wryly observes, "without having to go to the trouble of catching a fish, and without having to leave its own nest unprotected."13 At every level of the blandly named "food chain," organism preys upon organism in a macabre, unceasing dance of death. What could be religiously exemplary, inspiring, or healing about such a ghastly spectacle? The first thing to be said by way of response to this criticism of the religious ultimacy of nature is that the charge of cruelty seems inappropriate, a category mistake. Nature is not a conscious being, acting with deliberation 9. The cartoon appeared in the Denver Post, March 16, 1990, 4E. 10. Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, 171. 11.

Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene (New York: Oxford University Press, 1978), 5.</page><page sequence="6">306 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy and intent, as the term "cruelty" seems strongly to imply. Nor are its creatures, with the exception of humans, capable of acting with anything like a conscious aim to be cruel, what lawyers call "malice aforethought." Perhaps with this objection we have a residue of conventional theism being brought tacitly into the discussion. A critical feature of the religion of nature under discussion here is that nature itself is simply given, the stubborn, unavoidable way things are. It is not the creation of a conscious being or beings, not the outcome of choice, purpose, or design. Hence, there is no one to accuse or blame for its being what it is. Purposive beings (for example, humans) have emerged within nature, but we should avoid attributing purpose or purposiveness to nature as such. To complain of "cruelty" in nature seems to overlook this crucial idea and to fall back into a different, more traditional way of thinking. It might be argued that the effects are cruel, even though those effects may not be intended. But to speak of cruel effects seems strange if no cruel intentions are involved. Would we want to speak of the cruel effects of a rockslide, tornado, or flood? Such use of the term "cruel" is careless and misleading. It would be more accurate to speak of the destructive effects of such natural phenomena. A similar point holds for attribution of cruelty to nature or to creatures incapable of intentional acts. Second, the charge of rampant cruelty in nature betrays an anthropomorphic way of thinking, an unconscious reading of human qualities and sentiments into other creatures of nature. We have already alluded to this anthropomorphic tendency in our first response by criticizing the charge's implication that organisms such as the heron, scorpion, or praying mantis are capable of consciously intended cruelty in the manner of human beings. Elisabet Sahtouris warns us against the temptation to an anthropomorphic sentimentalizing of animal suffering when she takes account of "evidence that bodies which have evolved the capacity to feel pain as a trouble signal know when they can no longer protect themselves and turn off their pain system so they will not suffer needlessly."14 And it would seem far better for a weak or inept animal to die a mercifully quick death from pr?dation than for it to perish slowly from starvation through inability to fend for itself, as would often be the case. So we should not uncritically assimilate the sufferings of nature into our human frame of reference, naively imagining how we might feel in similar circumstances. Third, the charge of pervasive cruelty in nature tends to ignore the fact that routine deaths, far from being gratuitous or unnecessary, are essential to the operation of the whole system of nature. Death is not only a means 14. Elisabet Sahtouris, Gaia: The Human Journey from Chaos to Cosmos (New York: Pocket Books, 1989), 225.</page><page sequence="7">Voi 14, No. 3, September 1993 307 to nutrition, of allowing one group to feed upon another. It is also a means to population control that benefits all the members of an ecosystem over long periods of time, and it is an efficient way of recycling finite resources of nature. We need in addition to remember that, as Holmes Rolston and Paul Colinvaux have indicated, while suffering and death by pr?dation are inevitable, given the kind of system nature is, ecological balance keeps them to a minimum; and there is much peaceful, non-competitive coexistence among living beings in their ecological niches.15 So we should not exaggerate the extent of suffering or preying on sentient life in nature. Furthermore, without death, there would have been no such thing as biological evolution on earth and no humans to ponder the religious significance of nature! In fact, no biological organisms of any kind would now exist here, for any populations of them, expanding without limit, would long since have exceeded the planet's carrying capacity. I do not want to trivialize the suffering of sentient beings, even though I think it incorrect to speak of this suffering as implying pervasive cruelty in nature or among its creatures. My fourth and final response to this charge, then, is to explain more fully how I, as a proponent of the religion of nature, regard this suffering. It might be thought, on the basis of what has been said so far, that I am well on the way to advocating some kind of a whole-part or "big picture" physidicy, namely, the view that the sufferings of natural organisms are wholly compensated for or even rendered unimportant by the efficient functioning and life-sustaining character of the whole system of nature. This, however, is not my view. I do not wish to be interpreted as a Stoic or a Dr. Pangloss about the natural order. There undeniably is a sense in which things in nature worfc together for much good, for example, the good of sublimely ordered ecosystems, existent on earth and probably elsewhere in the universe as well, in which incredible varieties of interdependent life forms emerge and flourish. But we must take full cognizance of the fact that things also work together to produce much suffering and pain. Rolston is right to insist that nature is "pro-life,"16 but it is also pro death. This statement in a novel by Susan Howatch strikingly enunciates the combination of truths: "Despite all the volumes written by learned men on the meaning of life the reality is very simple: all things die except life; despite death life gets handed on."17 Hence, while death in nature is indeed for the 15.

This fact does not make nature itself cruel, for reasons already indicated. But it does bar the way to a glib whole-part physidicy. The unity of nature as I see it is not one which simply swallows up its parts, rendering their sufferings insignificant and unreal, mere passing phases of the all-important, completely salutary functioning of the whole. I reject such "through-and-through" unity, as William James calls it, and opt for an axtological version of what he terms "concatenated unity."18 In this concatenated unity view of nature, there is an irreducible dialectic of parts and whole, meaning that while we need to see the parts in relation to the whole, we also need to see the whole in relation to the parts. Neither is to be subsumed under the other. Therefore, goods of the whole that are achieved through the sufferings and deaths of the parts are attenuated and qualified by those sufferings and deaths, just as the sufferings and deaths gain positive meaning from the goods of the whole they make possible. Moreover, evolutionary processes do not always do what is best for all concerned, nor do they always act in the most efficient manner. The goodness of nature, in other words, is an ambiguous goodness. It is interwoven with elements of irremediable pain and loss that have to be taken into account. III. Nature's Alleged Indifference to Human Beings Even if we grant that nature is neither flagrantly wasteful nor pervasively cruel, it still seems to be completely indifferent to the torments and pains, strivings and ideals of human beings. In his essay entitled "Nature" John Stuart Mill recounts ways in which people are regularly terrified, diseased, deprived, maimed, bereaved, or slaughtered by natural processes. He then attributes to nature "the most supercilious disregard both of mercy and of justice," and "the most callous indifference" to human well-being.19 Pondering his father's painful death from intestinal cancer, a character in the novel By Love Possessed reflects that "to justify to men these ways of 18. William James, Essays in Radical Empiricism and A Pluralistic Universe, two volumes in one (Gloucester, MA: Peter Smith, 1967), I, 107-8. A concatenated unity, according to James, is the sort of unity we find in the experienced world. It combines elements of order and disorder, causality and chance, internal and external relations, intelligibility and inexplicability. A through-and-through unity, by contrast, exhibits only the first in each of these pairs; it is the kind of world envisioned by rationalists such as Benedict Spinoza and F.H. Bradley. What I am adding to James's analysis is elements of good and evil, life and death, enjoyment and suffering. 19. John Stuart Mill, Nature and Utility of Religion, ed.

As of course, nature's inhumanity to man passed even man's to man."20 Gerald Birney Smith draws a similar conclusion when he says, "[i]f we take the facts as we find them, we are compelled to recognize that the cosmic process seems to be largely indifferent to moral values."21 Nature's apparent utter obliviousness to the deepest needs and concerns of human beings, then, would seem radically to disqualify it from being a proper focus of their religious hope and commitment. The first thing to notice about this third objection to a religion of nature is that it treats nature as though it were something entirely separate from or external to human life. This approach seems to assume radical dualisms of mind and body, humanity and nature, and to ignore the serious conceptual problems posed by such dualisms. In so doing, it also paints a distorted picture of nature as lived, as directly experienced by human beings. And it fails to take into account the pivotal contributions of evolutionary and ecological biology to an understanding of the place of human beings in nature. I shall not comment further on the notorious difficulties plaguing metaphysical dualisms, since they are generally well known, at least among philosophers.22 And I have talked elsewhere about the critical importance of conceiving nature as concretely lived, noting the centrality of this idea in John Dewey 's philosophy of nature and showing how it bridges yawning rifts between humans and nature argued for or assumed in philosophies of the modern period.23 I want to focus briefly here on the bearing of the closely related sciences of evolution and ecology on the notion that nature is something alien and external to human beings. The biological sciences in our time do not portray human beings as radically separated from nature but as integrally related to it. According to the theory of evolution, humans are natural organisms and have evolved by means of the same processes and principles that gave rise to other organisms. They are participants in a history of origination and development common to all living beings on earth. Ecological science, for its part, 20.

David Oates beautifully describes this intricacy of relatedness in both time and space: The trick of seeing things separately?say, an individual tree abstracted from its forest and climate?is as artificial and misleading as looking at a river without reference to the region it drains. Neither trees nor rivers exist in isolation. In the dimension of time, a tree's biological history connects it to perhaps millions of other individuals. And in the dimensions of space, a tree both affects and is affected by hordes of other creatures, from the microscopic life in its roots to the birds and animals in its branches, from the squirrel that buried its original seed, to the plants which for some reason left a place for it to grow, to the termites and beetles and saprophytes that will consume it when it dies. An "individual" tree, in this tradition of ecology, is in some significant ways Jess meaningful than the tree seen as an embedded aspect of a history and an ecosystem.24 What holds for trees holds also for human beings. Sahtouris gives but one small indication of this fact when she notes that every molecule of air we "breathe, with the exception of trace amounts of inert gases such as argon and krypton, has actually been recently produced inside the cells of other living creatures."25 Were it not for the plants' capacity for taking in carbon dioxide and emitting oxygen, we would not be here. Nature, then, is not something outside us or set over against us; it suffuses and sustains us in countless ways, through every moment of our lives. As Bruce Wilshire puts the matter, each human self "is a field being, involved in some way in the cycles of the self-regenerating, interdependent universe."26 We do not exist apart from nature, but as a part of nature. To the extent that the third objection to a religion of nature assumes otherwise, it seems to fly in the face of much important evidence. A second thing to notice about this objection is that it is curiously one sided. It depicts nature as a capricious, always menacing power that gives 24.

And it can find no relations?other than purely destructive ones?between nature, on the one hand, and the meanings and values embedded in human cultures and human consciousness, on the other.27 But while we sometimes experience aspects of nature as frighteningly unpredictable and destructive, the objection neglects to note that most of the time we experience nature as providing ample nurture and support for our lives, and as being so predictable and reliable in its ongoing processes?including those of our bodies?as to be taken for granted. As for the meanings and values enshrined in human cultures, and the pervasive importance of the pursuit of values in individual human experience, we would be mistaken if we thought that nature contributed nothing to these. Rolston rightly asks, "How do we humans come to be charged up with values if there was and is nothing in nature charging us up so?"28 Our penchant for envisioning and striving for the attainment of values?moral, aesthetic, and religious; our possession of intelligence, consciousness, and freedom; our ability to fashion languages and diverse, ever developing cultures?all of these are nature's gifts to us. Here is no bland indifference to things human, but moving testimony to nature's boundless creativity and continuing support. My third response to the objection to a religion of nature now under discussion is to suggest briefly how nature can have redemptive significance for human beings and thus to counter in another way the notion that it has or can have no positive bearing on their existential concerns. I confine my attention to two aspects of the religious sense of redemption: assurance and demand. Let us look briefly at how each relates to a religion of nature. A religion of nature can provide the fulfilling confidence that comes from conviction of having found the meaning and end of our lives. For the religion of nature, we are natural beings through and through. We belong to the cosmos, and it to us. Here we are comfortably at home. Principles and laws that apply to other organisms apply to us. Distinctive though we be as a species, we are not aliens on the earth, but one of its numerous offspring, generally sheltered and sustained?although sometimes threatened and harmed?by its immanent powers. Like all natural beings, we are vulnerable, and we come into being and pass away. But we can have a keen sense of privilege to be here as creatures with knowledge and awareness, capable of contemplating nature's imposing majesty, its awesome beauty, its restless 27. See, for example, the stark contrast Bertrand Russell draws between the cultural creations of human beings and the "trampling march" of natural forces, "blind to good and evil, reckless of destruction," that portend the doom of these creations after human history has had its "little day."

Rolston, Environmental Ethics, 207.</page><page sequence="12">312 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy creativity, its incredible diversity?and its complex interdependencies that encompass us and our cultural activities. Oates testifies to the redemptive effect of such awareness when he tells of how, after at first feeling assaulted and victimized by a terrifying lightning storm on a high peak, he somehow broke through to a deeper comprehension that nature was not an indifferent power standing over against him but a sustaining presence of which he was an intimate part. "I was connected. I can scarcely convey what a deliverance this news was to me. I was not some alien being wandering a dead world, but a living part of the living earth. I belonged here." In this new mood of "curious calm," as he describes it, he was able to see lightning storms as appropriate expressions of the "realness" of the mountains, of their being "simply themselves."29 His exposure to such fearsome power, he saw, was no different from that of other earthly creatures, and he no longer yearned for the human situation to be otherwise. The price exacted by the sense of belonging, in other words, is that of being able to come to terms with the laws of our natural home, and with our susceptibility as finite beings to the operations of those laws. The privilege of belonging is to be able to say with restful assurance of our relation to nature what the Upanishads affirm of Brahman: "That thou art!" A religion of nature can thus abundantly satisfy what Oates characterizes as "one of the most powerful of human longings: the desire to be rooted in nature."30 In this way it can rejuvenate, inspire, and redeem. Don Cupitt warns us, however, against putatively religious visions that lack seriousness and depth because they make no demands upon us.31 If a religion of nature is to qualify as being redemptive in the complete sense of that term, it must call for more than mere passive celebration of our rootedness in nature. With recognition of our connectedness and belongingness comes recognition of accompanying serious responsibilities. Only by understanding the demands that our relations to nature impose upon us can we begin to become attuned to the natural order and to experience a religion of nature's transformative powers. This is not the place to lay out in detail the demand aspect of the redemptive significance of a religion of nature. But I do want to sketch in some of its outlines. First, and most obvious, is the demand that we strive to be ecologically responsible. We must abandon the delusion that non-living and living parts of nature are there simply to be utilized by us, in any way we 29. Oates, Earth Rising, 227. 30. Ibid., 57. 31. Don Cupitt, The Sea of Faith: Christianity in Change (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 249.</page><page sequence="13">Voi 14, No. 3, September 1993 313 see fit. We must exhibit by our actions, both individually and collectively, a reverence for ecosystems, species, and particular life forms. We must control our human population and learn to keep our technologies in balance with nature. We must recycle and conserve. We must restore those parts of the earth that our agricultural and industrial practices have ravaged. We must find ways to cease disrupting and destroying our natural home and build harmonious relations with all its creatures. We must set aside and preserve wild places to remind ourselves of the abiding significance and value of that nature of which we are part. The meaning of ecological responsibility has been much discussed in our time, and I need not belabor its details here. I want only to emphasize its fundamental place in a religion of nature. Second, we would do well to try to emulate some aspects of nature in our political systems and in our relations with one another. Given the axiological ambiguity of nature stressed earlier, we should not assume that acknowledging the ultimacy of nature requires that we try to imitate all of nature's ways in a slavish, unthinking fashion. The mistake of Social Darwinism at the turn of this century was to think that the non-human part of nature, in all its aspects, must furnish norms for human conduct. But the non-human part of nature can forcibly bring home to us certain crucial moral demands. Let me cite two examples. On the one hand, the teeming diversity of ecological systems projects an ideal of striving for human societies in which such differences as those of cultural background, individual temperament, and personal freedom are cherished, supported, and allowed to flourish. The tight networks of interdependency and interrelatedness in ecosystems, on the other hand, suggest the critical moral demands of shared responsibility and mutual respect, of learning to live together despite our differences and of seeking high levels of dynamism and progress in society through encouraging creative interactions of its diverse constituencies. The demands of a religion of nature do not stem exclusively, however, from non-human nature. That is not what the ultimacy of nature means, at least not in the religious outlook being decribed here. We need to remind ourselves again that, in the perspective of a religion of nature, human beings, with their cultures and patterns of social existence?impressively distinct as these are in comparison with other aspects of nature?are an integral part of nature and manifest its inherent potentialities. The moral demands of our human social existence, as enshrined in our various moral traditions and reflected in our ongoing struggles to build more just societies, have an integrity and importance that cannot be simply reduced to established practices in the rest of nature. Nevertheless, these moral demands are to be viewed as a central component of the redemptive significance of a religion</page><page sequence="14">314 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy of nature because all human activities are seen as being in and of nature, not external to it or set over against it.32 Moreover, for a religion of nature, the moral demands incumbent upon human life cannot be restricted to human communities or human social interactions. This brings us back to the theme of our ecological obligations. What H. Richard Niebuhr writes from his own perspective of Christian theism is especially appropriate for a religion of nature: "our life .. . takes place within a society whose boundaries cannot be drawn in space, or time, or extent of interaction, short of a whole in which we live and move and have our being."33 For a religion of nature, that whole is nature itself, and the full range of responsibility and demand adumbrated in Niebuhr's statement constitutes a crucial part of the redemptive significance of this religious vision. This significance, in its two dimensions of assurance and demand, helps to lay to rest the misguided notion that nature must be regarded as wholly indifferent to human activities and concerns. IV. Conclusion Having given reasons for rejecting claims that nature is flagrantly wasteful, pervasively cruel, or coldly indifferent to human beings, I have responded to three principal objections to the religious ultimacy of nature. The task of physidicy that I have undertaken here is in one important respect much easier than that of traditional theodicy, for proponents of a religion of nature can base their inquiries at the outset on the sheer givenness of an unconscious, non-purposive nature and its concatenated ambiguities. Sufferings, pains, and deprivations in the universe need not be ultimately traced?as in the Book of Job?to the inscrutable personal will of an all perfect, all-powerful God who has created the universe and everything in it, and who continues to preside over its fate.34 32. William Dean, in a critical response to this essay, has asked, "why do you not advocate a religion of nature and culture, rather than just a religion of nature?" My answer is that nature already includes culture; culture is not something in addition to nature but one expression of its exuberant creativity. I do not for a moment deny the crucial importance of culture or cultural values to human existence, but I place culture in the larger context of the ultimacy of nature. 33. H.

I am grateful to Robert Delzell, William Dean, and Holmes Rolston, III, for their insightful critical comments on an earlier version of this essay. While I have not had space here to address all of their questions and concerns, some of which would require separate essays for an adequate response, these will be much in my mind as I continue to reflect on the theme of the religious ultimacy of nature.</page></plain_text>
