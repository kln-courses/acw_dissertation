<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zoos: Valuable Adjuncts for the Instruction of Animal Behavior Duane M. Rumbaugh This paper considers various ways in which zoos can be used for instruction in animal behavior and comparative psychology. Too frequently instructors in these areas fail to recognize the unique educational potential which a zoo offers. The experiences that have provided the basis for this paper were acquired from 1959-69 when, as a Professor of Psychology at San Diego State College, I used the San Diego Zoo for instruction and research. It is to that fine zoo and its inimitable director, Dr. Charles R. Schroeder, that this treatise is gratefully dedicated. Making Arrangements With the Zoo Many zoos have established pro- cedures for admitting classes for occa- sional study. If the zoo is to be used for instruction only now and then, the instructor should learn of those pro- cedures and work within their bounds. On the other hand, if he desires regular admission of his class for part or all of a semester, he should meet with the zoo's director to establish personal contact and discuss in detail the instructional plans. In my experience, most zoo directors welcome classes to their zoos; however, there are limits within which the zoo will extend cooperation. Whereas zoo staff are willing and prepared to accom- modate occasional requests, their long- term and continuing cooperation can be achieved only by careful planning. Avoid having your instructional needs appear to zoo personnel as costly and problematic activities that interfere with the zoo's prime function-the exhibiting of animal forms. Patience must be exercised liberally by the instructor if he wants to use the zoo on a continuing basis. I recommend the following procedures: 1) Discuss with the zoo director, The author is with the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322. or his designated representative, plans for use of the zoo. Be specific! As the Zoo's prime func- tion is the exhibit of animals, the director will want assurance that all activities will be compatible with that function. He will want to know of costs, if any, and how they are to be covered, and whether the proposed activities constitute any unusual risk of liability. 2) Once verbal approval is achieved, a letter should follow in which an exact summary statement of the agreement is provided for all who have need to know. Ask the zoo director who should receive infor- mation regarding the arrange- ments. If the main contact is to be one of his appointed represen- tatives, be sure that the zoo direc- tor receives at least a copy of the original letter. (Frequently cer- tain administrators of the instruc- tor's institution also will want to know of such arrangements, par- ticularly when there are codified regulations relating to field trips.) Make sure that the letter assumes neither more nor less than that agreed to in conference. 3) Take care to ensure that as an instructor you fulfill your part of the commitment. At this point, you are establishing for the rec- ord what the zoo can expect in the future. Remember-if you abide by the agreement, you will have every right to remind the zoo if it fails in so doing. To voice this reminder in a courteous man- ner might prove necessary from time to time. 4) After the zoo has been used in accordance with procedures agreed to in conference and let- ter, write yet another note or letter to the zoo expressing grati- tude for its cooperation. Express the hope that such arrangements can be worked out along a similar line at some point in the future. Initial requests for a visit to a zoo should be very modest. Perhaps just admission to the grounds for purpose of lecture and observation will suffice for the first few visits. Once the presence of a class is recog- nized as an asset by the zoo, it should be possible to work out a variety of accommodations that will serve to en- rich instruction, such as: (a) the with- holding of food or water from certain animals for a few hours prior to observa- tion; (b) the separation of one or more animals for a given period of time, then reuniting them for observation; and (c) the introduction of food or various objects to stimulate manipulatory and social behaviors. At times even the most carefully pre- pared arrangements at the zoo will fail, as in the instance of some crisis with animals or a breakdown in communica- tion or memory. In such instances, an attempt should be made to reschedule the activity as soon as possible because of its importance to the instructional program. If the instructor views the activity as not important enough to reschedule, zoo personnel are likely to conclude that it wasn't important enough to schedule in the first place. All too frequently students of animal behavior give the impression that what they do has little justification or merit. Whereas food might be introduced to hungry animals to better understand their social organization, the reason for so doing might be totally obscure to others. It is important that zoo person- nel, whose time is called upon for cooperation, understand at least the essence of what is being done and its importance. Failure to do this discour- ages cooperation. Since most if not all zoos view as their first priority the maintenance of animals for exhibit, they will assist educational and research programs only to some point consistent with that priority and their fiscal resources. The instructor who approaches and interacts with the zoo personnel with this in BioScience Vol. 21 No. 15 806</page><page sequence="2">mind will avoid many painful pitfalls and will enjoy a relaxed and productive cooperative arrangement. Use, but don't abuse, the zoo. Use of the Zoo As an Exhibit. A general orientation to the zoo is a worthwhile topic for the first on-site class session. Most zoos have maps which show the locations of the various exhibits and pamphlets which summarize the specimens on exhibit in each area. Use of these materials can be helpful. Depending upon the instructor's familiarity with the curators, he might invite one of them to meet with the class. Also recommended is a discussion either by the instructor, the zoo's veteri- narian, or a curator of the unique problems encountered in maintaining various species in captivity. It is impor- tant to familiarize students at an early date with the problems of health and behavior adjustment which must be continually considered whenever ani- mals are maintained in other than their own ecological niches. For additional sessions at the zoo, a class will benefit by directing its atten- tion to a variety of behavioral phenom- ena. Illustrative of those commonly observed in zoos are as follows: 1) Begging Behaviors. It is quite likely that many animals will beg for food; bears, seals, baboons, and spider monkeys do this frequently. It is worth- while to discuss with your students the conditioned stimuli for the begging be- havior, the reinforcement for it, the variety of forms which the begging behavior assumes, and why some, but not all, species commonly develop these behaviors. 2) Activity Levels. Find an exhibit with a group of mammals and the class can consider the variety of activities and the different levels of energy expendi- ture manifested by the specimens ac- cording to their age, motivations, time of day, weather conditions, etc. 3) Play Behaviors. Infant-infant interactions that appear playful are worth attention. The definition of play behavior and its adaptive value provide good bases for discussion (Loizos, 1969). 4) Ingestive Behaviors. Eating is frequently observable. If attention is directed to how morphology determines most of the animals' eating behaviors, comparing various vertebrates, and how nutritional needs dictate in part food preferences, the topic of ingestion is worthwhile. 5) Use of Space. As the class goes from exhibit to exhibit, have them consider the apparent ways in which the animals use the space available to them (Menzel, 1969). Usually it is not too difficult to spot areas favored for rest, feeding, and elimination (Hediger, 1955). Students also should be alerted to observe marking behaviors as fre- quently manifested by a variety of mammals-certain lemurs, canines, etc. In the case of certain ungulates, favorite pathways or trails in the exhibit area will be obvious. The pattern of these in relation to feeding and rubbing stations (as with zebras) are worthy of particular attention. Finally, it is almost inevitable that certain abberant and/or highly repetitive and stereotyped locomotor patterns will be observed (Berkson, 1968). Consider the etiology of some of the highly stereotyped motion and pac- ing patterns manifested by many pri- mates, canines, and bears. The question as to how rearing and caging conditions might attenuate these behaviors is ex- tremely worthwhile and of great interest to students. 6) Sexual Behaviors. Depending upon the species, their caging, social contexts, and in some instances season of the year, sexual behaviors are likely to be observed. Questions relating to the effects of the estrous cycle and the social context upon the sexual behavior of primates might be considered. 7) Female-Young Interactions. Any female with an infant is of high intrinsic interest value (Rheingold, 1963). Stop and watch their behaviors in detail. Consider how the female attends to her young, how she restricts certain of its behaviors and movements, and how she compensates for the immaturity and behavioral inadequacies of the infant. 8) Imprinting. Quite likely, evi- dence of imprinting either among the ruminants or fowl of the zoo will be noted (Sluckin, 1967). If it happens that the specimens of the group ob- served become frightened by some event, such as a plane overhead, it is interesting to observe how the animals respond relative to one another; whether they group together or dis- perse, whether they move or remain immobile, should not go unnoticed (Marler, 1968). 9) Care-Giving/Care-Soliciting Be- haviors. Be alert for care-giving and care-soliciting behaviors (Scott, 1958). Grooming behavior among primates is almost guaranteed. The importance of grooming as opposed to sexual behav- iors for the organization and mainte- nance of social groups should be dis- cussed (Jay, 1968). 10) Communications. There are, of course, a variety of signals and sense modalities used by animal forms to convey certain information among themselves (Jay, 1968). Draw the class's attention to the various vocalizations and responses to them, to the physical contact made among animals and what those contacts might convey by way of meaning, to the various eye contacts and avoidance of eye contacts among certain animals, and also to certain odors, as from an adult male gorilla, that can be emitted with excitement. Among primates, the phenomena of lip-smacking, presenting, and yawning as well as vigorous threats including lunges are likely to be seen and should be considered as characteristic of a given species and as forms of communication. 11) Locomotion. The various pat- terns of locomotion among genera of a given order and of specimens varying in age are worthy of attention. The brachi- ation of gibbons and siamangs and the use of the prehensile tail by many of the New World monkeys should be noted (Tuttle, 1970). 12) Animal Acts. Many zoos have either seal shows or chimpanzee acts that a class will enjoy and benefit from, especially if attention is drawn to the various stimuli and rewards used by the trainer to control behaviors (Hediger, 1955). Try to arrange to have the trainer meet the class for at least a brief time and have him describe the proce- dures used for the formation of an animal act. His ideas and methods are many times quite different from those which a college- or university-trained behaviorist might employ. Developing Observational Skills. Extraordinary skills and talents are required to permit meaningful observa- tions of animal behavior. It is, of course, a simple matter to just look at animals, but to do so without some orientation and training is likely to result in either boredom or failure to appreciate the magnificence and possible significance of what is observed. One of the most important achieve- ments of the first few class sessions at a zoo is to demonstrate clearly to stu- dents that throughout its waking hours August 1, 1971 807</page><page sequence="3">an animal is always behaving and inter- acting with its environment. At a given time an animal might not be particularly active but he is nonetheless alert, re- sponding to a wide variety of stimuli from the external environment. An ani- mal at rest on a perch or ledge might be "doing nothing" so far as gross body movement is concerned; however, the animal might be continually monitoring the behavior of a cage mate, attending to certain visitors who address them- selves to the animal's cage, responsive to birds or pieces of paper being blown by the wind, or even cowering in fear as though attack from another animal is imminent. If students note that animals are always responding while awake, they can proceed quickly to a variety of important questions. For example: (1) What is the animal attending to visually, aurally, haptically, socially, etc.? (2) To what extent are these a function of the stimuli's physical properties or the ani- mal's motivational states? (3) Do ani- mals within a given cage appear to differ with regard to what attracts their atten- tion and, if so, are the differences possibly related to their sex and age? (4) Are differences among genera suggested in regard to readiness to notice events outside the cage? (5) Is a male's be- havior, including level of responsiveness to stimuli outside of its cage, a function of the presence of a female in estrous, an infant's vocalization, a vociferous exchange between animals in an adja- cent cage, or the approximation of feeding time (e.g., Bernstein, 1964)? Also, the question-Why?-can be asked of all the students' answers or specula- tions. Depending upon the number of ex- hibits and animals available at the zoo, considerable time can be well spent by taking the class as a group to each exhibit to consider in detail the possible determinants of each animal's behavior as it occurs more or less in spontaneous form. Too, it is worthwhile to assign pairs of students to different exhibits and ask them to work independently for the same period of time and to describe what one animal does. At the end of 15 minutes observation, have them present their summary notes regarding behav- ioral patterns and sequences along with probable determinants or correlates of the observed behavior. (The class will have an interesting time comparing dis- crepancies.) Over the course of time, the reports of the students comprising each pair will increasingly coincide. It is also 808 worthwhile to have the students exam- ine through discussion whether that which is being reported is a valid record of what, in fact, the animals' adjust- ments were to the stimuli of its physical and social environment. Such exercises can increase the stu- dents' interest in the study of behavior. They also provide an excellent context within which to train students to think and to benefit from the give-and-take of evaluating one another's work. These sessions also provide an excel- lent opportunity for the instructor to consider the differences between: (1) the anecdotes as provided by an un- trained and possibly biased observer; (2) the reports of a skilled observer; (3) the pitfalls of anthropomorphism; and (4) the basic merit of patiently observing with an eye honed to detect the subtle nuances of behavior and possible defini- tion of the internal and external cor- relates or determinants thereof. Students should be encouraged to conclude that animal behavior is so complex that in a real sense discovery is possible. Relatively few species have been studied in any detail in the field, let alone in captivity, and the frontiers of knowledge are immediately at hand. Students should also learn at this point that if they are to do creative work, they must develop skills to define either new phenomena or new approaches for study of already defined ones. The introductory sessions also lend themselves to meaningful exercises in the formulation of operational defini- tions. There are a variety of ways of structuring meaningful exercises to de- velop skills in defining terms. One of the better ways is to have the students take terms such as grooming, leaping, attack, present, etc., and to attempt brief suc- cinct definitions that insofar as possible exclude other irrelevant behaviors (see Kaufman and Rosenblum, 1966). Con- sideration can be given to minute res- ponses as opposed to molar behaviors so far as satisfactory definition of the behavioral event is concerned. Thus, on the one hand, grooming (as in primates) might be defined in terms of rather specific, minute responses of the mouth and fingers and, on the other hand, it might be defined with emphasis upon a pattern of behavior that, accoridng to the species, might include an invitation, positioning, lip movements, and vocali- zations. During the initial session the students should also note that the behavioral effects of such factors as the presence of an observer and time of day are con- founded with the appearance of visitors, routine feedings, and the various dimen- sions of weather, including temperature and precipitation. If the instructor is successful in the first few sessions on the zoo grounds, he will have a group of highly motivated students who neither lack for ideas nor enthusiasm for continued study of ani- mal behavior, whether at the zoo, in the laboratory, in the field, or library. (See Bobbitt et al., 1966;Odom et al., 1970; Menzel, 1969 for helpful ideas and methods of observational study.) Basic Equipment for Zoo Project Work Although there is no limit to the equipment that might be used in a zoo setting to facilitate the conduct of behavioral studies, it is best to have little or none for the first few sessions or even the first course which students have on the zoo grounds. Students should learn to observe and to define problems. They cannot do this if they are burdened with highly sophisticated equipment. For the first course, the student might well have nothing more than pencil, paper, and clip board. If the clip board is modified so as to hold a counter or stop watch in view, so much the better. Usually zoo animals are so close that even field glasses are unneces- sary and prove to be an encumbrance. It is helpful for the instructor to have a small tape recorder which can be used for a variety of purposes. Because the instructor is likely to find it desirable to ask students to make frequency counts of certain select behaviors per unit of time, he needs some way of signalling to a large number of students the passing of a predetermined number of seconds or minutes. This can be done very easily by recording a time signal or count on a tape and have it played at a sound level so that all students in the immediate area can hear it. Tapes with 5-, 10-, 30-, and 60-second time signals that run for 5 or 10 minutes will prove valuable. (The use of an auditory time signal rarely distracts zoo animals for they hear all kinds of peculiar things through- out the day.) An auditory time signal keeps the students from having to visu- ally check a stop watch to determine if the desired number of seconds have elapsed for each observational time unit. Students will soon learn that if they have to check clocks and complicated BioScience Vol. 21 No. 15</page><page sequence="4">check lists, they will lose visual surveil- lance of the behavior to be recorded. Most students like the idea of having a tape recorder into which they can dictate their observations. At least for the first several sessions, this should be discouraged, for every minute that the student dictates into a tape recorder, he can expect to spend 2 or more minutes extracting the information which he has recorded. It is far better to spend the time in observing and thinking. Also, if a student has the diversion of a tape recorder, he is not as likely to concen- trate upon his observations. This in no way denies the good service to which a tape recorder can be put for certain kinds of behavioral studies both in the field and in captivity. If a birth is being observed or if some other unique event is being monitored, and it just is not possible to anticipate what one will see and want to record, the use of dictation into a battery-powered tape recorder is well advised. It is unlikely, however, that the beginning student can benefit maximally by starting his observational training in that way. Students should be encouraged to use photography to docu- ment their observations and to assist them in definition of terms. The use of photography in the recording of rare events is of inestimable value. Interaction and Communications With the Zoo Visitors Almost invariably as students view exhibits and begin making notations on clip boards and in other ways making records, the inquisitive zoo visitor will ask what they are doing. These ques- tions should be dealt with in a courte- ous manner but, as importantly, in a way that will discourage conversation while critical observations are being made. It frequently suffices for the student to reply, "I am studying the behaviors of this animal." If, as the student replies, he also returns his un- divided attention to the animal and to. his record-taking, the zoo visitor will usually conclude that he is busy and is not to be disturbed. But if the visitor persists in further questions, the stu- dents can advise the visitor that he must continue his observations at this time but will be free to talk later. Few zoo visitors are really that interested in knowing of the study in progress, and almost invariably they will amble along in search of other diversions. All inter- actions between students and zoo visi- tors should be brief but courteous. Zoos depend almost exclusively upon their ability to attract visitors; their enthusi- asm to cooperate with instructional programs will vanish if by so doing visitors are insulted or otherwise badly treated. The instructor and students can per- form a great service for the zoo and the general public by helping to educate the zoo visitor that an animal's behavior can be the most remarkable information to be obtained from a given exhibit. Too many visitors saunter aimlessly about the zoo as though they are just looking at one peculiar animal after another. The meaningfulness of their visit to the zoo can be enhanced if, from time to time, the instructor and his students contribute articles to publications spon- sored by the zoo (Appendix A) and also make themselves available for talks to civic groups. If articles and talks are well prepared and include considerations rel- evant to conservation and to the ad- vantages of understanding how behavior can enhance adaptation and survival in captivity as well as in the field, a receptive audience is almost assured. Similarly, if one has access to a reputa- ble science writer in the local press, news accounts of the educational program being conducted at the zoo and sum- mary accounts of student projects can be of inestimable value to the education of the general public. Contributions along these lines of public education will be appreciated by the administration of any progressive zoo.
