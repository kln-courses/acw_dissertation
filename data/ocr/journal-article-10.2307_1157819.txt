<plain_text><page sequence="1">[46] ASO1U WORSHIP AMONG THE NZEMA: A STUDY IN AKAN ART AND RELIGION VINIGI L. GROTTANELLI T HE present paper describes and discusses a group of earthenware figurines made and used for ritual purposes by the Nzema of south-western Ghana. The material was collected by me during a six weeks' stay in the Nzema village of Skebaku, near Atuabo, in the autumn of 1954.' INTRODUCTION Apart from its aesthetic evaluation, the study of any art object or class of objects should be carried out following three distinct though interrelated lines of analysis. The first is iconographic, i.e. at the same time morphological, technological, and historical, and concerns the nature of the objects per se, their formal characters, the technique of production, their distribution in space and time, and their stylistic affinities to similar productions elsewhere. The second is iconological, and has to do with the meaning of the representation, the nature of the beings it purports to portray, and the underlying system of conceptions and beliefs in which it is integrated-the world of ideas and symbols in a given culture. These first two aspects of the analysis are common also to archaeological research. The third approach, on the other hand, is more distinctly anthropological, as it deals with the impact of those ideas and of their concrete symbols on the everyday life of the society concerned and with their influence on the ritual and social behaviour and thought of individual men and women. Only a combination of these three approaches can give us a true picture of the phenomenon we are called upon to investigate. The present discussion falls short of this desirable completeness, if only for the fact that reasons of space have forced me to limit myself to the first two aspects mentioned. My materials concerning the third aspect will be dealt with elsewhere. As these data present a higher degree of variability, they might usefully be integrated by further investigation on the matter-were it not for the well-grounded suspicion that the particular class of figurines discussed here may by this time have been wiped out of existence in Nzemaland altogether, or at any rate may disappear in the near future, along with the beliefs and practices they are linked with, in the framework of a rapidly changing culture. A few introductory words on the Nzema themselves may perhaps be useful to the general reader, because they are possibly the least known of the groups forming the great Akan family. A tribe of farmers and fishermen, numbering probably over 50o,ooo,2 they occupy the extreme south-western corner of Ghana, extending in some places beyond the border into the Ivory Coast. Their country is mainly the forest and My journey from the Ivory Coast to Ghana, and acknowledgement is here made. my stay in this country, were partly made pos- 2 The official census of I92I gave a figure of sible by a grant by the Wenner-Gren Foundation about 40,000: Welman, p. i. for Anthropological Research, to which grateful</page><page sequence="2">A STUDY IN AKAN ART AND RELIGION 47 lagoon area between the lower courses of the Ankobra and Tano rivers, and probably owing to this peripherical position it has been less affected by modern processes of urbanization and industrialization than the more easterly provinces of the country. A fairly large proportion of the literate and more enterprising part of the Nzema population, especially among the younger generations, tends to emigrate to the larger towns and industrial areas of Ghana and of the Ivory Coast. In the larger centres, such as Beyin, Half-Assini, Atuabo, &amp;c., there are numerous Christians (Catholics, Protestants, followers of W. W. Harris or 'Water Carriers '), but else- where the vast majority have retained their traditional religion; this was the case in Ekebaku, a coastal village of some 250 inhabitants, to which I restricted my investigations. The Nzema are usually named as a group of the Akan people, either as an indepen- dent unit within this family,' or as a dialectal section of the Fante;2 more recently and correctly, their language has been classified as an Anyi dialect among the several forming the ' Anyi-Baule dialect cluster' within the Akan language group.3 As my informants assured me, there is complete mutual intelligibility between Nzema and Anyi, and to a large extent also between Nzema and Bahule, but not with the Twi- speaking peoples. Social structure and traditional political organization, based on a system of seven matriclans and of hereditary 'stools ', have many features in common with those of the better-known Akan groups; with the Ashanti, the Nzema have a joking relationship and can abuse the Asantehene with impunity. Of their history little is known, though they appear to have been already settled in their present territory in the fifteenth century at the time of the first contacts with Europeans (to whom they were later known by the name of Appolonians or Apollonians), and though the names of some famous paramount chiefs have been handed down by tradition, starting with one omanhene Amihere Penin, said to have begun his reign about I4oo00.4 The study of their physical characters is a complete blank, no anthro- pological measurements ever having been taken. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASOQU SHRINES By a coincidence, which is all the more fortunate in view of the general paucity of literature on the Nzema, a first mention of the asoyu shrines and figurines was pub- lished in Dakar shortly before my visit to the area, though it came to my notice only later.5 Apart from details, the group of shrines near Half-Assini described by the Rev. H. Debrunner corresponds fairly closely with the similar one found by me the following year on the north-western outskirts of Ekebaku, situated some twenty miles east of Half-Assini. The site lay about fifty yards or so off the path leading from the village to the yam gardens inland, and could hardly be called a clearing, as the shrines were interspersed in the bush, isolated or in groups of threes and fours, among a thick growth of trees Baumann, Thurnwald, and Westermann, 1940, sprachlichen Stellung des Nzema innerhalb der Akan- p. 387. 2 Hailey, 1938, p. 94. sprachen) but to my knowledge has not hitherto been 3 Westermann and Bryan, I952, p. 80.

However, in front of each group of shrines the ground appeared to have been cleared at some recent date, and most of the ' altars ' were in a relatively fair state of repair. The shrines in themselves are simple cage-like structures of diminutive rafters and rattan, consisting of a rectangular platform of about 2 x 4 ft. and raised some 2 ft. from the ground, supported by four or six posts embedded in the soil, and surmounted by a slanting roof of corresponding size and structure (Plate I a). Bundles of reeds and palm leaves are, in some cases, propped up against the sides of this framework and heaped on to the roof in order to protect or conceal the shrine; a coarse cane mat resembling a Venetian blind may be tied to the roof so that it can be lowered to cover the front of the shrine. Apart from the statuettes, the platforms contained nothing but a few crude earthen- ware bowls holding the remains of food offerings, occasional chunks of white clay, and some empty bottles of European make. In some of the shrines, a bowl was placed in front of each figurine, but in others there was only one bowl for four or five of the latter, which seemed to suggest that at least on the occasion of the last offering only one particular asoyu had been presented with food, or that a collective offering had been made to a group of asoyu. There was no general enclosure or fence of any sort round the shrines, nor could I see in the vicinity any of the amonle or charms (rattan loops with sea-shells, snail shells, little bundles tied to forked sticks, &amp;c.) which the Nzema hang so lavishly around their gardens and compounds or in the coconut groves to deter strangers and thieves. The reason for this is that the asoyu shrines need no protection, being power- ful enough in themselves to ward off any intruder. I was told that no man or woman in the village, including those individuals who have actually set up the shrines, ever goes near the latter unless for cult purposes, and I was acutely aware of the uneasiness with which my Nzema friends followed me in my three inspections of the spot. After my first acquaintance with the shrines, I passed the word that I wished to have one or more of the figurines for myself, but for several days my message was ignored; indeed, my informants pointed out to me that as I had two children (who were very young at the time) it would have been most unwise and dangerous to bring any of the asouz home. As I insisted, I was told that there was only one person in the neigh- bourhood-a komenle or' fetish '-priest from the town of Beyin-who might possibly supply me with some figurines: which indeed he did in course of time, though at no small cost. I was luckier, in this respect, than Debrunner, who a year earlier had succeeded in securing only one of these objects, and had been allowed to do so merely because 'it had lost all its power '. The Beyin priest, whose name will not be given here, provided me before my departure with four statuettes, along with an exact though somewhat smaller replica of a shrine made by him at my request, and with a wooden object carved in phallic shape, heavily coated with lime, at the base of which a sea-shell and a coin are tied by means of white calico strips.2 On my last visit to the ?kebaku shrines, from a secluded altar that appeared to be badly dilapidated and abandoned I was further able to collect four more statuettes which had fallen I Debrunner, p.

Shortly after my return to Italy, a letter received from one of my Nzema friends, with whom I had discussed the asoyu, contained the following news: ' One famous man has appeared in our area speaking to us about God, burning all the " Asongu " and the other " Amonle ?' in the country. He is called Deazete, he is from the French Ivory Coast. He came here about one and a half months ago. At present, we have no more " Amonle " at all in the country.'I The letter is dated 5 January I955: the destruction of the asogu must therefore have taken place around mid-November I954. Similar autos-da-fe, in which objects of pagan worship are indiscriminately burnt or destroyed, are, of course, far from rare in the history of West Africa; the Nzema themselves remember well how in the days of Prophet Harris all their amonle (' fetishes ', as they used to be called) were solemnly thrown into the sea. I have not had the opportunity of returning to the Nzema area since, or to ascer- tain whether the asoyu worship has really come to a definitive end or has been revived more or less secretly. In the former case, the objects collected by me, in addition to the similar one illustrated by Debrunner, have a good chance of being the only relics of this cult. ICONOGRAPHIC DATA (a) Description of the figurines. The figurines described here are more or less uniform in size (height varying from a minimum of 95 to a maximum of z20 mm., i.e. 4 to 5 in.) and in material, which is a naturally greyish-brown clay turning brick red upon firing. The actual firing process has not been witnessed, but was described to me as identical with the process followed in making domestic pottery, which is placed on a bed of sticks on the open ground and covered sideways with one or two layers of dry firewood, to which fire is then set; the only difference allegedly being that the asopu are secretly prepared and fired by the priest or by his assistants under his supervision. With one exception (see below) all the figurines have been evenly and properly fired. They show no traces of the carbonaceous deposit, characteristic, according to Braunholtz, of recent Ghana pottery. The paste is rather coarse and porous, which is perhaps what Debrunner meant by describing it as ' terre cuite qui ne desseche pas '; but his immediately following statement (' aussi elles ne peuvent etre que des figurines informes ') is harder to account for. In fact, in at least six out of the eight specimens examined by me, modelling is accurate, if not delicate, and shows that the artist or artists have succeeded in expressing their conception of the beings represented with as great a wealth of detail as the diminutive size of the figurines permitted. The small free surfaces (e.g. the backs) have in some cases undergone a smoothing process, but there has been no attempt at polishing or burnishing. After firing, all the statuettes have been coated with a thick layer of white clay, which has had the effect-still apparent in figurine No. z-of obliterating their features almost entirely, in somewhat I The name, or nickname, of this prophet, of whom I had heard in I954 in Abidjan, is presumably 'Dix-sept '. E 49</page><page sequence="7">ASO1JU WORSHIP AMONG THE NZEMA paradoxical contrast to the care displayed in the modelling. This covering, which has a symbolical rather than a decorative purpose, has for the most part been washed away or removed by rain or other agents, but all the figurines retain traces of it. Another noticeable feature common to all the items examined is a small cylindrical hollow of about I inch in diameter and i inch in depth, bored into the base of the figurine before firing, probably by inserting into the raw clay a small segment of stick or cane which is subsequently destroyed by the fire. This could be a device for permitting the figurines to be later fitted on to a peg thrust into the ground and thus kept upright, but I have not noticed that this is actually done, nor does there seem to be any need to support the objects, as they have a sufficiently broad and flat base to stand on their own. It may be, however, that this procedure is resorted to at the moment of firing, in order to fix the raw statuettes to the bed of sticks and prevent them from toppling over and being damaged during the firing operation. The details of individual figurines illustrated here are as follows: i. Thick cylindrical body, slightly tilted backward, with small (female?) breasts and large protruding navel; arms reduced to mere vertical stumps adhering to the sides of the body. The head, heavy in proportion to the body, rests almost directly on the latter, only the vaguest attempt having been made to indicate the thinning out of the neck. The hair-style is in six tufts, the ears semicircular in shape; a distinctly aquiline nose, ' coffee-grain ' eyes, and a long slit mouth with practically no chin are the most distinctive features. A very slight semicircular rim on the upper chest could possibly represent a necklace. The lower limbs are missing altogether, the body being truncated just under the navel and ending in a flat circular edge, slightly broader than the rest of the figure. As in all other asoyu, there is no indication of the sex. Height 95 mm. (just under 4 in.). 2. This is the only figurine of the group to have retained completely its thick white clay coating, which I have naturally been unwilling to remove. This makes it very difficult to detect the finer traits of the statuette, which is slightly larger and heavier than the others. Even through the coating, however, it is clear that the shape of eyes, ears, and aquiline nose falls into the same class as that of No. i; the nostrils are equally marked, two tiny holes having been bored deliberately through the white clay layer. The navel is proportionately less bulging than in the previous figurines, being no more prominent than the breasts (a male figure?). The mouth is big and gaping, the head has a pronounced backward slant, as if the personage were looking upward, and ends in a roughly triangular mop. A plain white shell (cardiuri) is tied to the waist of the figurine by means of a thin slip of white calico. 3. This figure is substantially different from all the others, the only common traits being the aquiline nose and the protruding navel. The balance between head and torso is disregarded, the former constituting about two-thirds of the whole. The hair is divided into two distinct crests, parted by a deep groove in the centre, from the rounded forehead to the back of the head; each crest is in turn divided on the outer side by three lesser hollows, thus forming four combined ridges on each side. The eyes are reduced to mere slits, at uneven levels; the ears are represented by round holes; below these, two marked hollows run down both sides of the figure, from the cheek to the level of the navel. The breasts are not indicated, and indeed there is no room for them, as strangely enough the protruding navel is placed almost directly 50</page><page sequence="8">A STUDY IN AKAN ART AND RELIGION under the crudely cut mouth. That this bulge is meant to represent the navel is clear from comparison with other specimens; from its position, it could otherwise easily be taken to be the chin or a beard, or even a conspicuous Adam's apple. The whole figurine appears distorted and irregular in shape as if modelled by an inexperienced craftsman in a hurry. Height 15 mm. 4. The same type as No. I, with slight differences in detail: hair in 8 small tufts, ears perforated. Height 90 mm.I 5. The main characteristics in comparison with the previous types are the lack of a clear dividing line between head and body, and the fact that the mouth is treated in the same way as the eyes (' coffee-grain ' shape), lips being obtained by the same technique as the eyelids. There is further a triangular element in relief under the mouth, which can hardly be a beard as the figurine has distinctly feminine breasts, or even a chin, as a similar appendix in No. 6 is placed immediately under the breasts. Arms are larger than in Nos. i and 4, and look like magnified ears, starting from the forehead down to the level of the breasts. The hair is in five large tufts. A shell is appended as in No. 2. Height 95 mm. 6. Similar in general appearance to No. 5, except that the breasts are somewhat incongruously placed very high up, just under the mouth on each side, and at an unusual distance from the navel. The hair is gathered into a single conical chignon on the top of the head, or perhaps this conical shape is meant to represent a cap or hat; the latter explanation is suggested by a sort of rim running above the forehead. Height 87 mm. One figurine (not illustrated) is incomplete, as it was damaged during its journey from Ghana to Italy, and of the many broken fragments only a few could safely be identified and restored to their original place. It is interesting, nevertheless, because the type of fractures has revealed the actual modelling technique, which consists in shaping the roughly cylindrical torso out of one lump of clay, obviously without the help of a mould, then adding smaller lumps to form the arms, navel, breasts, &amp;c. Firing normally moulds the individual parts into a solid whole, but in this case the process must have been incomplete or interrupted, only the blackened base surface showing signs of proper oxidizing. Hence the fragility of the object and the abnormal colour of the material, which has remained a brownish-grey instead of turning red. This was not apparent when I first obtained the figurine (sold to me by the Beyin priest, together with Nos. 4, 5, and 6), because it had received the same white coating as all the others. The only part it has been possible to restore fully is the top of the head, showing the hair grouped in seven tufts. Height 96 mm. (just under 4 in.). (b) Stylistic parallels. Asoyu figurines must be regarded as a new, though certainly not a major, style in the frame of West African art. Their artistic merits are slight, nevertheless it is strange that they should have remained unnoticed until the present day, because they are so strikingly different from all other contemporary productions of this area. In Nzemaland itself they are, as far as I know, practically unique. Apart from stools, which are made and carved according to the usual Akan style, the Nzema have little or no sculpture and (apart from some ababa 'dolls') no use for wooden figurines or masks such as can be found elsewhere in West Africa, nor do they produce gold- i Published by Grottanelli, I955, pl. 3. 5</page><page sequence="9">ASO)U WORSHIP AMONG THE NZEMA weights like their eastern neighbours, or other objects of artistic interest. Their pot- tery itself, apart from the asoyu, is purely utilitarian in nature and scope. Comparison with anthropomorphic figurines in contemporary Ashanti and Fante ceramics, which might be supposed to represent the nearest parallel,I shows that there is no stylistic resemblance. The same negative conclusion is reached if one looks for possible parallels in the production of the Anyi-Bahule group to the west, to which the Nzema are ethnically related, or indeed in that of any other West African people. During the last few years I have carefully gone through the exhibits and stores of a great many museums in western Europe and in America without finding any object reminiscent of the asoyui style, nor-which is more relevant-are any such parallels to be found among the rich collections of the Abidjan Museum or those of the Accra Museum,2 which are specifically devoted to the arts of the Ivory Coast and Ghana respectively. Comparison with terracotta figurines from archaeological findings in the Gold Coast does not yield convincing results either. The ' coffee-grain ' eye can be found in one of the Agona heads published by R. P. Wild,3 but in this as in other specimens of this type the rounded facial contours, the ringed neck, the minute rendering of the hair show no resemblance to the Nzema technique and style. The same typical eye is present in the fine terracotta head from Kwahu, found near Kajebi, northern Ho district, and now in the British Museum; but in modelling, proportions, and finishing this head reveals a far higher artistic level and no direct affinity with Nzema figurines. The only two possible parallels of which I am aware at present are geographically more remote. The first is represented by a recently published Yoruba clay figurine,4 said to be ' an objectivation of the fear of death as experienced in the nightmare ', portraying' a suffocating spirit (Sigidi or Sugudu) sent by a sorcerer '. The resemblance, as far as one is allowed to infer from Mr. Morton-Williams's photograph, lies mostly in the general shape of the figurine, here again apparently truncated just under the navel; in the fact that in both cases we are confronted with terracotta, a rather unusual medium of expression in the West African coastal area; and in the fact that both the Yoruba and the Nzema plastics are in some way connected with death and the fear of death. But apart from this, the sigidi is about twice the size of the asoyu; its modelling appears to be much ruder, and treatment of arms and features is altogether different. In other words, an accurate comparison shows that there is little similarity in detail and that reciprocal derivation or direct connexion is unlikely, without, however, dispelling the general impression of relationship of a sort, possibly due to some common source of inspiration. Evidence for the latter is lacking in the present state of our knowledge. The second parallel, which is iconographically more striking, is with certain ' Sao ' terracottas of Lake Chad area. Judgement on the similarity between Nzema figurine No. 2 and the Sao head reproduced in Plate I d (Griaule, 1947) can be left to the reader. Even though the clear shape of some of the features is not clearly distinguishable in the Nzema object owing to the thickness of the clay coating, it is clear that the See Rattray, 1927, figs. 25I, 253; Baumann, 3 Wild, I937, pl. xii a, no. 4; see also Braunholtz, 1940, fig. 325.

True, the Sao sculpture published by Griaule consists of the head alone, but when we consider full-bodied figurines like the one shown by Lebeuf in fig. 41' we find that statuettes limited to the torso and abruptly truncated in a flat base with no indication of sex and legs were also common in the inventory of Sao ceramics, though in slightly larger dimensions. In the last of these three figurines another characteristic can be found in common with Nzema counterparts: a hair- or head-dress consisting of a number of separate tufts, formed by small separate lumps of clay; the eye, ear, and breast show the same treatment as in the asoyu. Further like- nesses (in eye, nose, and mouth) can be observed between the figurine collected by Debrunnerz and the head reproduced by Lebeuf in fig. 32,3 where dimensions also seem to tally. On purely iconographic grounds, the relation between the asoyu and Lake Chad figurines appears to be something more than a mere casual resemblance. Methodo- logically, the inquirer would be satisfied with the applicability in this comparison of Graebner and Schmidt's criteria of form (or quality) and quantity; but the criterion of continuity is hardly applicable, as the Sao of Lake Chad and the Nzema of Ghana are separated by a thousand miles in space and a thousand years in time, and at the present state of our knowledge no intermediate productions of a similar kind can be resorted to in order to fill this double gap. It should naturally also not be overlooked that certain similarities may be due to mere technological reasons or ultimately to t&amp;e nature of the material employed, and therefore ethnologically not significant for the establishment of a qualitative similarity; in this sense, Goldenweiser's criterion of limited possibilities may pertinently be applied. For instance, there are not many alternative solutions offered to the potter who, using clay, wishes to reproduce plastically the shape of a breast, of a navel, or of a tuft of hair at a simple level of representation. Other features, however, (e.g. the eye, mouth, nose) seem to call for a less elementary treatment and to permit more variants, formal similarities thus becoming more significant in these cases. Comparisons with archaeological material, the interpretation of which cannot be supported by reliable historical traditions or written records, as is the case with the Lake Chad findings, must needs be mainly of an iconographic nature. Iconological interpretation cannot but be conjectural, and this lacuna in knowledge obviously detracts from the desirable completeness of the comparison. In spite of this reserve, I could not help being struck by the information reported by Lebeuf on the basis of his inquiries among the present-day inhabitants of the areas where his findings were made: 'Les souvenirs que la vue de ces objets [earthenware statuettes] fait sourdre chez les indigenes permettent d'assurer qu'ils furent modeles soit lors de la naissance d'enfants soit apres la mort d'adultes. Des sacrifices etaient alors accomplis, des offrandes faites qui avaient pour but de proteger les nouveaux-nes des maladies mortelles que pouvaient, sans cela, leur transmettre les esprits errants.... '4 This rationale tallies very closely with that stated by the Nzema with regard to the asoyu, as will shortly be seen. It is obvious that the natives questioned by Lebeuf were by I Lebeuf and Masson-Detourbet (1950), p. 135. 3 Lebeuf and Masson-Detourbet, 1950, p. 123.

II2. 53</page><page sequence="11">ASOJU WORSHIP AMONG THE NZEMA no means attempting a conjectural reinterpretation of a buried past after a blank of ten centuries; they were expressing a cultural awareness in relation to a set of beliefs which had not been forgotten and which must have been a living reality to them or to their immediate forefathers. Cultural continuity with the distant past is thus suggested, though certainly by no means proved. ICONOLOGICAL DATA (a) Three aspects of symbolism. I shall deal briefly with these aspects first, though they have a marginal character, because they are closely connected with the extrinsic appearance of the figurines already described, and also in order to clear the ground of an interpretation which has already been put forward and which appears to be at least doubtful. In his paper already quoted, Debrunner has called attention to the number of tufts of hair on the statuette collected by him as well as on another, which he probably saw at Half-Assini but gives no picture of. This number was seven in the first case, five in the second, and, following an oral suggestion by M. Holas, the author con- nects these data with the corresponding sacred numbers of the Akan. Seven, according to Mrs. Meyerowitz, is ' symbol for the universe and the state '. Five, according to Debrunner's quotation of Rattray, is connected with impua;nu;m (not nzpuannumz, as incorrectly given), the 'five tufts (of hair)', as shown in an Adinkira stamp pattern used for decorating cloths.I It could also be added, of course, that 5 is the well-known symbol of Nyame as the Supreme Being. But surely before investigating further into the matter of numerical symbolism it is wise to ascertain on the one hand whether we have reason to know, or at least to surmise, that the potters decided the number of hair-tufts for each figurine according to a deliberate iconological pattern somehow connected with the significance of numbers, rather than according to formal con- venience or just at random; and secondly, how far this supposed intentional disposi- tion of the artists is actually supported by iconographic evidence at our disposal. Now on the first point we have no information whatsoever from Nzema sources. As to the second point, no relevant conclusion of a general nature can of course be drawn from two isolated objects: all one can do is to note that one of the Debrunner figurines happens to have 7 tufts,2 while the other has 5. The statistical relevance of this first discovery would admittedly be enhanced if the number of tufts again hap- I Debrunner (I953), PP. II-I2; Meyerowitz (I95I), pp. 96 and iii; Rattray (I927), p. 265. Debrunner goes on to say: ' Dans quelle mesure ces considerations peuvent etre utiles pour comprendre la signification de ces statuettes, je l'ignore. Mal- heureusement, je n'ai pas prete attention a la significa- tion des touffes de cheveux lors de mon passage a Half-Assini; aussi n'ai-je pas pousse plus avant mes investigations, ni recherch6 si les statuettes pre- sentaient d'autres dessins. I1 en est de meme pour les signes tribaux distinctifs qui se trouvent sur les statuettes. A mon avis, ceux qu'on voit a la fig. 3 ne sont pas nzima.' I must join Debrunner in confessing that it did not occur to me either to investigate the matter of hair tufts, but I doubt whether such an inquiry would have evoked much response from my Nzema friends. As to the ' other drawings ' or ' patterns ' (dessins) I am sure the Ckebaku figurines bore none. If by ' distinctive tribal signs' is meant the features of the figurines-and looking at Debrunncr's fig. 3 I don't see what else could- his doubt is difficult to understand. 2 It should be noted for the sake of precision that in the ' croquis representatif d'une statuette azongu ' (fig. 3 of Debrunner's article) the same statuette is shown in full face as having 7 tufts, and in profile as having 5. (It actually has 7, as Mr. H. D. Collings, Director of the Ghana Museum, has kindly con- firmed.) One should also not forget that according to Mrs. Meyerowitz not only 5 and 7, but all//numbers ranging from I to 16 have some symbolical meaning or other among the Akan. 54</page><page sequence="12">A STUDY IN AKAN ART AND RELIGION pened to be 7 or 5 in the sixteen asogu I now have a record of (the six described above, two others, not illustrated, plus four each in two close-range photographs in my series showing these figurines on their shrines in sufficiently clear detail). But the corresponding number of tufts in this series is respectively: 6, i, 2 (or 8), 8, 5, i (hat?), I, 7, o, 4, 4 (or 5), I, o, o, o, o, zero meaning that no attempt has been made in these cases to reproduce the hair, the figurines appearing to have a smooth rounded head, whether bald or shaven. I think no further comment is needed to show that until new evidence of a positive nature is available, conjectures on the 'hair-tufts symbolism' will have to be regarded as pure guesswork. A distinctive feature of the asogu, the symbolical meaning of which is beyond doubt, is the white clay coating (ewuole) applied to all of them as well as to other objects con- nected with their worship. Parallels among other Akan peoples, the Ashanti in par- ticular, are so well known that they do not deserve quoting here, so I shall restrict myself to drawing from my field-notes a few significant examples referring to the Nzema themselves. A husband suspecting his wife of witchcraft, theft, adultery, &amp;c., will ask her to make a solemn confession of her crimes, possibly forcing her to drink a potion or amonle prepared by a doctor, which the woman must take sitting on the ground with her legs stretched out. After the confession, which is supposed to purify the woman from her sins, the person who has administered the drink and listened to the avowals will besmear the woman's back with ewuole, possibly taken from an asoyu. The widow who, after the prescribed period of mourning, goes to the Tano river or to a lesser stream to wash away the defilement caused by death, will leave on the river bank everything she has used for bathing (soap, sponge, towel) as well as her old clothes, and daub herself with ewuole before putting on her new dress of white calico. On the occasion of the yearly sacrifice performed in Beyin by the people of Western Nzema- land in honour of Salaman, the bosonle of lightning, a special shrine is erected, con- sisting of a circular hedge of konzloma or hpunlili plants, in the centre of which a small senleya tree is planted; on the forked branches of the latter, a brass pan is placed, and before people proceed to offer prayers and sacrifice, two things must ceremonially be put into the pan, the thunderbolt sacred to Salaman, and one or more chunks of ewuole. The ceremonial role of ewuole, the white substancepar excellence, as a symbol of purity and sacredness, is thus well established in Nzema ritual, and one or two more examples of its use will be given in the following paragraphs. Finally, the widespread use of shells in the making of various types of amonle, or charms, especially for the purpose of warding off intruders and thieves from gardens, coconut groves, &amp;c., suggests that shells are credited by the Nzema with apotropaic virtues. They are also known to ward off ghosts. A special shell, kogolo mpe, is strung on to a widow's waistband on the eighth day after the husband's death, in order to keep the spirit of the deceased at large, and she will wear it for a year; otherwise she would be sure to have trouble with the ghost. It is not surprising, as we shall see, that an apotropaic connotation should be attached to the asoyu themselves; at the same time, however, the cardium sea-shells used in this particular connexion are white, thus adding to the immaculate appearance of the figurines. (b) Nature andfunction of the asogu. The earthenware figurines are believed to be the abode, and possibly also the image, of supernatural beings whose primary connexion 55</page><page sequence="13">ASOIU WORSHIP AMONG THE NZEMA is with children's ailments and death, the name asoyu being applied both to the material images and to the in-dwelling beings. This dual use of the name explains why they are simultaneously conceived of as ' charms ', amonile, in their material representation, and as gods, lesser awozonle, in their essence. They are supposed to be very numerous. That they are regarded as personal beings is proved by the fact that, like other awozonle, they are given individual names, e.g. Atweneboa, Agys, Kangya, Eligye, Abutukuro, &amp;c., and are the object of individual worship; each person can have only one asoyu.' With regard to sex, they are supposed to be both male and female. The figurines themselves tell us little in this respect: as in the Half-Assini specimen and in the others described above, also in the many other specimens I saw in ?kebaku, the sexual organs were not shown, all the figurines ending abruptly at the loins; the breasts, when they are shown, are sometimes pronounced enough to be interpreted as feminine, but then, as we have seen, this may well be due to a technique permitting little subtlety in plastic representation and accuracy of proportions. The normal dwelling-place of the asoyu is said to be ebah (the underworld), but they are at the same time also clearly active on earth. One of my informants spoke of them as 'living in the bush', so there is no real consensus on this point, possibly not a vital one in Nzema eyes. At any rate, they are not connected with the sea, lagoon, and rivers, as is the case with the main awozonle. Though most of the conceptions and practices at the base of the asoyu complex are clearly traditional among the Nzema, I was repeatedly told, somewhat to my surprise, that the cult in itself is a relatively recent one. It appears to have been ' discovered ' following the bereaved parents' attempt to find out the reason why so many of their children died. The priests, to whom the matter was submitted, consulted the awozonle, and it was through the response of the latter that the asoyu came to be recognized and worshipped. How long ago this actually happened, my informants were not able to state; but all agreed in repeating that in former days people did not know or care about the asomu. That there should be good reasons for the Nzema to worry about infant mortality is proved, at any rate, by the exceptionally high death-rate among children under the age of 6 or 7. In the village of ?kebaku, for which I obtained as complete statistical data as circumstances allowed, the rate proved to exceed 40 per cent. according to the statements of present inhabitants.2 If in an individual case asoyu is effectively identified before it has caused lethal effects, and if the appropriate course of ritual action is then followed, the harmful being can be appeased and eventually turned into a positive force which may serve the interests of the person connected with it. In other words, a second connexion of asoyu is with a tutelary force in defence of its worshippers, and in this respect its behaviour is similar to that of any minor deity in the common Akan sense of asuman. This protective function can reveal itself automatically, or it can be stimulated and I Confirmed by Debrunner, op. cit., p. 112. accuracies, due to the memory of informants or to 2 Adult individuals of every compound-men and incomplete registering of data, but there is no reason women-were interrogated on this, as well as on to believe that dozens of fathers and mothers should other points.

Allowance must of course be made for minor in- 56</page><page sequence="14">A STUDY IN AKAN ART AND RELIGION put into effect through the deliberate ritual action of the worshipper. For instance, if some spiteful or slanderous remark is made about a person and his or her feelings are hurt, or if malicious allegations are brought against the person even without the person's knowledge, the asoyu of the offended one will automatically attack the offender by causing him some sort of damage, usually in the form of sickness. Witch- craft directed against the protected party can thus also be prevented or counteracted, without the person even being aware of it. In other cases, if property is stolen from a worshipper, he will go to the shrine of his own asoyu with a small offering and com- plain of the theft; the asogu will then trace the thief and cause him to fall sick, and eventually kill him if the property is not promptly returned to the owner. This sort of protection is no doubt a positive asset in the worshipper's everyday life, but is not exempt from dangers. If the protected man or woman fails to satisfy the tutelary deity, by offering it ' chop' at prescribed times, the asogu will avenge itself by causing illness or death on the person or his near relations, especially children. It is therefore advisable not to overlook one's duties towards one's own asogu, and also towards that of one's parents as long as they are alive. The customary offerings may be a sheep once a year, a chicken three times a year with some yams and liquor (rum or gin or palm-wine, poured on the ground by the shrine); in case of special requests for assistance, further sacrifices may of course be ordered through a priest (komenle). Like other awozonle, the asogu are apt to ' possess ' priests and priestesses during dances, when they reach the condition of trance. My information on this point is scanty, and I shall not discuss it; but on the occasion of a dancing performance I witnessed in Beyin, I was told that one of the dancers, a woman of about 40 called Ahyele, was possessed by a female asoyu. I was able to take several photographs of her in her ecstatic condition and to film a few scenes of the dance. As Debrunner had rightly supposed, there is thus no direct relation between the asoyu and ancestor-worship; nor could I find traces of the belief that once their worshipper is dead such a deity will interfere with his offspring. Debrunner also reports (though explicitly qualifying the source as not very reliable) that one can set an asoyu on to other people as an act of black magic: I think this should be interpreted in the sense I have pointed out above, as a petition by the faithful to the deity in view of the detection and punishment of some offender or enemy. However, I should not venture to exclude the possibility that asoyu may be used as agents or allies in black magic. Contrary to Debrunner's case, my informants and interpreters were all Nzema, and though I have no grounds to doubt their sincerity, it may well be that some practices connected with this worship were withheld from me or presented in a slightly idealized light. Only a prolonged observation in the field, should the worship still survive somewhere or have been revived, could solve these doubtful points. Not all people are subject to an asoyu influence, I was told. Some are altogether unaware of it all their lives; others may find out that they are under such an influence only when fully grown up, on the occasion of an unaccountable illness; or again, an asoyu may manifest itself by suddenly causing a man to become impotent or, though more rarely, a woman to be barren.I Other individuals again are completely exempt X As an average, and by European standards, the Nzema are a very fertile nation. Nevertheless, the 57</page><page sequence="15">ASOIJU WORSHIP AMONG THE NZEMA from this influence, viz. the nyanogonle nmmal or 'lucky children ', who will be dis- cussed below. Even though the asoyu be defined as 'gods ', it is clear that many Nzema (espe- cially literate persons and, naturally, Christian converts) regard them as 'bad juju ', as Debrunner has aptly remarked. Were it not so, it would be hard to understand how and why the population should so readily have responded to the preaching of a foreign prophet against this worship, and so promptly have done away with all the shrines, as they are alleged to have done in I954. It is indeed a great pity, anthro- pologically speaking, that this preaching campaign, and the people's immediate and long-range reactions to it, should not have been witnessed and recorded by a trained observer. (c) People exemptfrom asoyu. As unborn children 'get' their asoyu in ebao, the subterranean after-world,I only people who come from Hades originally can be influenced by them. These are the vast majority, but there are exceptions, the most notable being the children given out by a bosonle, and those given out by God himself, Nyamenle. A barren woman will usually go and consult some old woman who has specialized in preparing medicines for causing pregnancy, or she will consult a diviner; but if her barrenness is not cured, she may go to the priest of some bosonle, who will pray to the god for her with the due offerings, and then give her some medicine. If after this she becomes pregnant, the child will be considered as a direct gift by the bosonle. Other children are supposed to be given by God himself, and they too do not come from ebol. They are given special names, among which Mensah quotes Alima, Azane, Asua, Nyameke, and Nyoqa. Twins are included in this category. They are all referred to by a special term, nyangonle mmale, ' godly children ', and are supposed to be ' clean and holy' and particularly lucky. On their birthdays, they are bathed and smeared with white clay all over their body, and a prayer is said for them, ' Nyamenie boavolema, beiwe nmo be oo te bokoo la, be we belua debie fufile nu, be nunzlu uanza yuanza ' (' 0 you whom God has helped, you are clean because you come from whiteness, may you have a pure and holy face, a clean countenance '). Afoto is then prepared, a special meal with mashed boiled plantains, palm oil, and eggs, with very exclusive invita- tions. The iyangonle mmale are subject to a special defilement whenever one of their high death-rate among children must be counter- balanced by numerous births: this is at least one of the reasons why sterility (as well as abortion and premature births) is considered a major disgrace. There are many explanations for it. It may be that the woman herself possesses witchcraft, consciously or not, and this prevents her from becoming pregnant or causes abortions. It may also be that an envious person gives the woman magically away to a boson/e, who will then ' use her as a hen ', i.e. ' take the eggs away' from her every time, thus preventing her from having children. Or again, a member of the woman's abusua may have spiritually 'taken her womb away ', be ye makpoke ne ayene nu. No one but a clansman or clanswoman has the power of doing this, though the witch can do injury even without realizing it, as it is said that 'a witch can operate with the back of her head '. When this influence is discovered, the sterile woman resorts to a priest, who will go out at night and claim or buy the spirit of the womb back from whoever detains it. Finally, if the woman happens to have married against her father's will, his sipe will prevent children from being born to her or kill them at birth (sipe is not a curse, it is a 'trouble' or 'sorrow' in the man's blood when he is displeased, which will pass on to his daughter because of the identity of blood between them). Sterility is thus caused by magical or animistic agencies; with regard to miscarriages, this is not always the case. They are often believed to be caused by kakatile and buamenle, two very small animals, both made of blood but of different shapes, who live in the womb and suck the embryo's blood with their sharply pointed ' mouth '. Treatment in these cases will be of a medical nature, by means of enema (deyee),. I Cf.

On such occasions, they must submit on the third day to ritual bathing and besmearing with ewuole. There are four different amonle exclusive to the ' godly children '. Three of these, ayooanzabenyunlu, kenya mozu, and abano, consist of various types of beads arranged and worn in some particular way: abamo, for instance, is made with beads called anengyenle, ahoa, and ndwonma, combined with a thin gold plate and with some hair from a white sheep, and must be worn on the left arm. The fourth charm is called nyangonle (lit. 'God's life ') and consists of a small circular fence built just outside a hut using the branches of the senlega tree; a larger three-forked branch of the same tree is planted in the centre of the fence, to support an earthenware pot filled with water and covered with white cloth. The pot is so placed that it may receive rain dripping from the overhanging roof.I Unless these amonle are observed, the ' godly children ' will be defiled and not prosper, and may even become mentally unstable or blind.

Resume LE CULTE DES ASOIDU PARMI LES NZtIMA LES figurines en terre cuite dites asoyu representaient, encore en 1954, une des rares produc- tions proprement artistiques des Nzema du Ghana. Elles sont censees avoir ete detruites en masse vers la fin de cette annee par les Nzema eux-memes, a la suite de la predication d'un 59</page><page sequence="17">60 ASOOU WORSHIP AMONG THE NZEMA prophete venu de la C6te d'Ivoire. L'auteur decrit six exemplaires de ces statuettes qu'il put remporter du Ghana avant cette date, avec une replique de l'autel qui les abritait et quelques accessoires du culte. Du point de vue iconographique, ces figurines constituent un style isole n'ayant que des ressemblances tres lointaines avec les plastiques en terre cuite ou autres des regions avoisinantes. On note cependant des similarites, en quelques cas frap- pantes, avec les terres cuites attribuees aux Sao de la region du Tchad. La considerable distance geographique ainsi que chronologique qui separe les deux groupes de statuettes impose d'envisager avec prudence la possibilite de connexions entre eux; on a tout de meme la surprise de constater que le role joue par les figurines sao, d'apres les informateurs locaux contemporains, n'etait pas foncierement different de celui des statuettes nzema. Les asoyu representent des divinites inferieures, qui se manifestent en premier lieu par des maladies des personnes auxquelles elles s'attachent, surtout des enfants. Si la presence des asoyu est reconnue a temps, le pere de l'enfant leur fait eriger un petit autel et fabriquer des figurines, auxquelles on offre des sacrifices: la guerison s'ensuit. Duiment apaise, l'asoyu peut devenir une sorte de genie tutelaire pour sa victime, prevenant tout acte de sorcellerie contre elle, la protegeant contre les vols, frappant a son tour de maladie ou de mort ceux qui l'offenseraient. Il cause aussi des phenomenes de possession sur certains individus lors des danses. Les asoyu, tres nombreux et appartenant aux deux sexes, sont connus chacun par un nom personnel; ils sont censes habiter la brousse, mais leur demeure d'origine est cboh, l'outre-tombe, et c'est la qu'ils s'attachent aux enfants avant leur naissance; ils n'ont cepen- dant rien a voir avec les gomenle, esprits des trepasses. II existe enfin des categories de personnes qui ne sont pas sujettes a l'action, nefaste ou utile, des asoyu, car elles ne viennent pas de l'cbah comme la plupart des etres humains, mais sont engendres grace a l'intervention directe d'une divinite ou meme du Dieu supreme, a la suite des sollicitations de leur mere. C'est le cas des enfants longuement attendus par des femmes steriles, des jumeaux, et en general des nyangonle mmalc, enfants 'purs et saints' du fait de leur conception exceptionnelle.
