In Paris, after almost three years of working closely with feminists and others, I am no longer sure either whom I am "observing," or who my "others" are. Given that inbetween state, I would like to begin with the title of the MLA Special Session for which this paper was originally written: "New Directions in Feminist Critical Theories in France and the Francophone World."2 I will be sharing with you here some of my reflections on theories developed in France (I should say in Paris) over the past two decades. That much is clear. But the words "new directions," "feminist," and "critical" pose a problem for me. First, it is unclear that there are any "new directions" in French feminist thought right now - for feminists in France at least. After the outburst of theoretical enthusiasm and energy during the late 1960's and early 1970's, the French Mouvement de lib6ration des femmes (MLF) experienced a series of splits, rivalries, and disappointments which have led them to stop, go back, think, read, and write again. In fact, the term "MLF" now legally belongs to only one group in France-"Psychoanalysis and Politics." And this group, according to its own literature and public stance, is most definitely opposed to feminism - as are many of the other women theorists, writing in France today, whose names are beginning to circulate in the United States. Who, then, do we mean by "feminist"? That word, too, poses a serious problem. Not that we would want to end up by demanding a definition of what feminism is and, therefore, of what one must do, say, and be, if one is to acquire that epithet; dictionary meanings are suffocating, to say the least. But if we were to take "feminism" for a moment as referring only to those in France who qualify themselves as feminists in their life and work, our task would be greatly simplified. For example, if I were to talk about feminist theorists in France, I would want to insist on what might be called the "invisible feminists," those younger women as yet not "famous" who are working quietly behind the scenes, in study groups and special seminars, trying to sort out and pick up the pieces left in the wake of the both theoretical and practical disputes of the last few years. Or I might invoke the feminists who are attempting to map out some very new and long awaited directions under Mitterand's government; or the ones who have left France to work at the Uni- versit6 des Femmes in Belgium, or in the United States. But, increasingly, when in the United States one refers to "feminist theories in France" or to "French 1 What follows is extracted from a longer study that I am in the process of completing: Gynesis: Woman in the Contemporary Imagination. 2My thanks to Marguerite LeClIzio for inviting me to present this paper at the 1981 MLA.

Perhaps this is because they are not, or are not primarily, working in feminist critical or literary theory, whereas theory is currently a locus of interest for American feminism. Feminist (literary) criticism, as such, does not really exist as a genre in France. To my knowledge, only three books published in France over the past few years could be categorized as feminist literary criticism: Anne-Marie Dardigna's Les chateaux d'eros, Claudine Herrmann's Les voleuses de langue, and Marcelle Marini's Les ter- ritoires du f6minin avec Marguerite Duras. 3 Other women theorists whose work has had or is beginning to have a major impact on theories of reading, and who at one level or another are writing about women, at the very least do not qualify themselves either privately or in their writing as feminists and, at the most, identify themselves and their work as hostile to, or "beyond," feminism as a concept. H&amp;l1ne Cixous, Sarah Kofman, Julia Kristeva, Eugenie Lemoine-Luccioni, for instance, belong to this group and their names are heard in the United States.4 I would even go so far as to say that the major new directions in French theory over the past two decades- whether articulated by men or women - posit themselves as profoundly, that is to say conceptually and in praxis, anti-feminist. That does not mean that they should be rejected or ignored by feminists. On the contrary. But it does mean that those American feminists, including myself, whose reading habits have been deeply changed by contemporary French thought must remain attentive to what are, ultimately, some very complex problems of translation - in the most literal sense of the word as well as in its broader and more difficult sense, as the inter-cultural exchange of ideas: the specific problems inherent to the importation and exportation of thought.' What follows may be seen as a gesture towards thinking through some of those prob- lems. First I will attempt to clarify what I mean by the "anti-feminism" of contemporary French thought and, in so doing, explicate my own title. Then I will complicate things further by outlining briefly what I see as the three major topographies of that French thought -as explored by the male theorists there. Why insist on "the men" instead of "the women"? Because all of the women theorists in France whose names I have mentioned are, to one degree or another, in the best French tradition and not unproblematically, direct disciples of those men. That is not meant as a criticism, but, at the same time, those women cannot be read as if they were working in isolation -especially in France where the tradition of the "school of thought" or the "literary salon" is still strong. I should also mention that the ques- tions and problems I am raising are grounded in a hypothesis that the "new directions" in contemporary French thought are, in their "inspiration" and "conclusions," an attempt to delimit and think through what is now loosely called "modernity" or, more problematically in the United States, "post-modernism." My feeling is that any "detour" of feminism through contemporary French thought is a voyage into that as yet still vague territory of modernity completely avoided, in my opinion, by Anglo-American feminist thought. The generic term "contemporary French theory" designates for me the first group of writers after the Frankfort School to try to come to terms with the (threatened?) collapse of the dialectic and its representations which is modernity. Ultimately, the question I would want to put into cir- culation here would be this: are feminism and modernity oxymoronic in their terms and ter- minology? If so, how and why? If not, what new ruse of reason has made them appear- at least in France-to be so? Not long ago, Annette Kolodny wrote that "As yet, no one has formulated any exacting definition of the term 'feminist criticism'" ["Some Notes on Defining a 'Feminist Criticism'" in 3Claudine Herrmann, Les voleuses de langue (Paris: des Femmes, 1976); Anne-Marie Dardigna, Les chateaux d'6ros (Paris: Maspero, 1980); and Marcelle Marini, Territoires du femminin avec Marguerite Duras (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1977). 4Luce Irigaray is a special case, one we will not be able to discuss in this essay, but will reserve for close attention at a later date. 5During the discussion following my presentation of this paper at the MLA, there was a lot of energy expended over the words "feminist" and "anti-feminist." It was almost as if the problems of translation addressed here could be resolved if everyone in the room could just come to an agreement about what feminism is-or is not. The problems with that (primarily Anglo-American) approach to interpretation are, of course, made abundantly clear by many of the French theorists mentioned here. What is impor- tant, they might say, is not to decide who is or isn't a feminist, but, rather, to examine how and why feminism - as both word and concept - may itself be problematic. diacritics / summer 1982 55</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Autumn 1975), p. 75]. Like Elaine Showalter, she distinguishes between those women who write about "men's books" and those who write about "women's books." (Kolodny also mentions a third category-"any criticism written by a woman, no matter what the subject,"- but she does not pursue it, implying its inadmissibility to any feminist.) Feminist criticism, within those parameters, is as multiple and heterogeneous as the "methodologies" available for use. She adds: "[These investigations] have allowed us to better define the portrayal of and attitudes toward female characters in a variety of authors and, where appropriate, helped us to expose the ways in which sexual bias and/or stereo- typed formulations of women's roles in society become codified in literary texts" [p. 75]. This short statement by Kolodny summarizes well, I think, feminist criticism in its most fundamen- tal gesture: an analysis (and critique) of fictional representations of women (characters) in men's and women's writing. If the author is male, one finds that the female destiny (at least in the novel) rarely deviates from one or two seemingly irreversible, dualistic teleologies: monster and/or angel, she is condemned to death (or sexual mutilation or disappearance) and/or to happy-ever- after marriage. Her plot is not her own and the feminist critic is at her best when drawing the painful analogies between those written plots and their mimetic counterparts in "real life." Increasingly, women feminist readers reach the point where they can no longer read "the men." That is, they begin to find the repetition unbearable. This is true of both kinds of male fictions-"fiction" and "criticism." This limit, when reached, is particularly relevant in the case of criticism, however, when one realizes that the majority of male critics (in all of their incarnations) seem not to have read (or taken seriously) what feminist criticism has pro- duced. They continue either to ignore gender or else to incorporate it into an untransformed reading system, with an ironic wink of the eye, a guilty humanistic benevolence, or a bold stroke of "male feminism." This is perhaps one of the reasons why the focus on women writers (and critics) has given such fresh energy to feminist criticism: focusing on women writers, feminist critics can leave this repetition behind, feel that they are charting an unknown territory which, at the same time, is strangely familiar. This mixture of unfamiliarity and intimate, identificatory reading seems, indeed, to be the key to a new creative feminist style. This change in focus has, at the very least and undoubtedly, produced some of the most important feminist criticism to date. Let this stand, then, as a brief outline of primarily Anglo-American feminist concerns: the sex of the author, narrative destinies, images of women, and gender stereotypes, are the touchstones of feminist literary criticism as it has developed, most particularly, in the United States. When one turns to France, however, one learns that this bedrock of feminist inquiry has been dislodged: there, in step with what are seen as the most important fictional texts of modernity, the "author" (and his or her intentionalities) has disappeared; the "narrative" has no teleology; "characters" are little more than proper name functions; the "image" as icon must be rendered unrecognizable; and the framework of sexual identity, recognized as intrinsic to all of those structures, is to be dismantled. We will be looking here at this new kind of inquiry where it intersects with what I am calling the fundamental feminist gesture. Of these intersections, there are three that seem to me particularly relevant. The first concerns the word, "author," and more generally, the problem of the speaking subject. Lacanian psychoanalysis, Nietzschean and neo-Heideggerian philosophies in France, have shaken this concept apart. As Michel Foucault reminds us, "None of this is recent: criticism and philosophy took note of the disappearance - or death - of the author some time ago. But the consequences of their discovery of it have not been sufficiently examined, nor has its impact been accurately measured" ["What is an Author?," trans. Josub V. Harari, in Textual Strategies (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1979), p. 143]. First, the "I" and the "we" have been utterly confused: the "1" is several, psychoanalysis has shown; and, further, one of the major ruses of Western metaphysics' violence has been the appropriation of a "we" by an imperialistic if imaginary "I" (whole individual with an interior and exterior, etc.) The notion of the "Self"-so intrinsic to Anglo-American thought- becomes absurd. It is not something called the "Self" which speaks, but language, the uncon- 56</page><page sequence="4">S I - ?i: L ~ : 1 ri a ~ - Y a ~ 2~ a I -B i u -- = 1 " i ??~~. i - P. ~,,,: a I Mi~ scious, the textuality of the text. If nothing else, there is only a "splendid anonymity" or a plural and neuter "they." Contemporary fiction enacts this anonymity within a lottery of con- stantly shifting pronouns. The assurance of an author's sex within this whirlpool of de-centering is problematized beyond recognition. The "policing of sexual identity" is henceforth seen as being com- plicitous with the appropriations of representation; gender (masculine, feminine) is separate from identity (female, male). The question of whether a "man" or "woman" wrote a text (a game feminists know well at the level of literary history) becomes nonsensical. A man becomes a woman [devient femme] when he writes, or, if not, he does not "write" (in the radical sense of 6criture) what he writes, or, at least, does not know what he's writing ... No-one writes. "And behind all of these questions we hear hardly anything but the stirring of an indifference:'What difference does it make who is speaking?'" [p. 160, my emphasis]. The feminist's initial incredulity faced with this complex "beyonding" of sexual identity is largely based on common sense (after all, someone wrote it?!). But is it not that very sense ("common to all," i.e. humanism) that the feminist is attempting to undermine? On the other hand, when you problematize "Man" (as being at the foundations of Western notions of the Self) to the extent that French thought has, you're bound to find "Woman"- no matter who's speak- ing-and that most definitely concerns feminist criticism. The second major intersection of importance here is the status and stakes of representa- tions, where the tools of representation (and of feminist criticism) - narrative, characters- are recognized as existing only at the level of the fantasies which have entrapped us. To endlessly analyze those fantasies is to ask for repetition. It is the process which moves beyond/behind/through those fantasies-the enunciation and disposition of phantasies6- which must be examined. That "process" is attached to no self, no stable psychological entity, no content. And, here again, "theory" is presented as in step with a certain kind of contemporary "fiction." The third intersection, and the most problematic for me personally, is the radical French requestioning of the status of fiction and, intrinsically, of the status of truth. One of the oldest metaphysical problems, this is the newest and most fundamental problem for modernity. What does the radical requestioning of the status of truth and/or fictions in theory (and fic- tion) in France imply for feminist criticism? The feminist critic is concerned about the rela- tionship between "fiction" and "reality" (truth) - with how the two interact, mime each other, and reinforce cultural patterns. These "new directions"- beyond the "Self," "the Dialectics of Representation," and beyond (Man's) "Truth"- have not emerged in a void. Over the past century, those master (European) narratives - history, religion- which have determined our sense of legitimacy in the West have undergone a series of crises in legitimation. Legitimacy is part of that judicial domain which, historically, has determined the right to govern, the succession of kings, the 6Here I maintain the distinction in English between "fantasies" (conscious) and "phantasies" (uncon- scious). diacritics/ summer 1982 57</page><page sequence="5">link between the father and son, the necessary paternal fiction, the ability to decide who is the father- in patriarchal culture. The crises experienced by the major Western narratives have not, therefore, been gender-neutral. They are crises in the narratives invented by men. To go back and try to analyze those narratives and their crises means going back to the Greek philosophies in which they are grounded and, most particularly, to the originary rela- tionships posited between the techn&amp; and physis, time and space, and all the dualistic couples which determine our ways of thinking. And rethinking those dualistic couples means, among other things, putting their "obligatory connotations" into discursive circula- tion, making those connotations explicit in order, one hopes, to put them into question. For example, the techn6 and time have always connoted the male; physis and space the female. To think new relationships between the techn6 and physis, time and space, within an atmos- phere of crisis, requires a backing away from all that has defined their relationships in the history of Western philosophy, a requestioning of the major topics of that philosophy: Man, the Subject, Truth, History, Meaning. At the forefront of this rethinking is a rejection by/within those narratives of what seem to have been the strongest pillars of their history: Anthropomorphism, Humanism, and Truth. And again, it is in France where, in my opinion, this rethinking has taken its strongest conceptual leaps, as "philosophy," "history," and "literature" attempt to account for the crisis-in-narrative which is modernity. In France, such rethinking has involved, above all, a reincorporation and reconcep- tualization of that which has been the master narratives' own "non-knowledge," what has eluded them, what has engulfed them. This other than themselves is almost always a "space" of some kind, over which the narrative has lost control, a space coded as feminine. To designate that process, I have suggested a new name, what I hope to be a believable neologism: gynesis - the putting into discourse of "woman" as that process beyond the Carte- sian Subject, the Dialectics of Representation, or Man's Truth. The object produced by this process is neither a person nor a thing, but a horizon, that towards which the process is tend- ing: a gynema. This gynema is a reading effect, a woman-in-effect, never stable, without identity. Its appearance in a written text is perhaps noticed only by the woman (feminist) reader-either at the point where it becomes insistently "feminine" or where women (as defined metaphysically, historically) seem magically to reappear within the discourse. The feminist reader's eye comes to a halt at this tear in the fabric, producing a state of uncertainty and sometimes of distrust -especially when the faltering narrative in which it is embedded has been articulated by a man from within a nonetheless still-existent-discipline. When it appears in women theorists' discourse, it would seem to be less troubling. The still existent slippages in signification among feminine/woman/women and what we are calling gynesis and gynema are dismissed as "unimportant" because it is a woman speaking. What I mean by the "anti-feminism" of contemporary French thought may now seem clearer. For feminism, as a concept, as inherited from the humanist and rationalist eighteenth century, is traditionally about a group of human beings in history whose identity is defined by that history's representation of sexual decidability. And every term of that definition has been put into question by contemporary French thought. In the writings of those French theorists participating in gynesis, "woman" may become intrinsic to entire conceptual systems, without being "about" women - much less "about" feminism. First, this is the case, literally, insofar as contemporary thought in France is based almost entirely on men's writing and, most importantly, on fiction written by men. For example, a survey of such disparate writers as Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze-or Hel1ne Cixous, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva-yields remarkably few references to women writers. (To women, yes; one even finds passing remarks on women theorists- Lou Andreas Salome, Marie Bonaparte, Melanie Klein - but to women writers, no.) Lacan has much advice for women analysts, but only focuses once on a woman writer (Marguerite Duras)- as having understood his theory! [Jacques Lacan, "Hommage A Marguerite Duras," recently reprinted in Marguerite Duras (Paris: Albatros, 1979).] Derrida, to my knowledge, never explicitly mentions a woman writer.7 Deleuze and Guattari refer to Virginia Woolf as 7Excluding Marie Bonaparte - essential to Derrida's critique of Lacan in Le facteur de la verit' - I can find only three oblique exceptions to this observation. Oblique in that a particular woman is never named in any of the three references: a footnote to "Violence et metaphysique" in L'&amp;criture et la 58</page><page sequence="6">having incorporated the process of what they call le devenir femme in her writing- but "not to the same extent" as Henry James, D. H. Lawrence, or Henry Miller [Gilles Deleuze and Claire Parnet, Dialogues (Paris: Flammarion, 1977), pp. 55-60]. The leading figure of "Psychoanalysis and Politics" and its women's bookstore Des Femmes, Cixous is perhaps the foremost theoretician in France on the specificity of "feminine writing" (which does not mean written by a woman). Yet it is not women writers who are the focus of her work. Her focus is on the male poets (Genet, H61derlin, Kafka, Kleist, Shakespeare) and on the male theoreticians (Derrida, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Lacan, Neitz- sche). Because in the past women have always written "as men," Cixous hardly ever alludes to women writers; one recent exception has been her reading and public praise of Clarisse Lispector, whose narrative is more "traditional" than one might have expected.8 Irigaray and Kristeva are uniquely concerned with analyzing the male tradition: from Freud to the philosophers to the avant-garde. The kind of empirical text-picking I have just indulged in is perhaps ultimately not very useful. But this textual lack of reference should at least be pointed out given our "intersections." For the second reason that gynesis is not necessarily "about" women is more abstract: women can (have) exist(ed) only as opposed to men within traditional categories of thought. Indeed, women (especially feminists) who continue to think within those categories are, henceforth, seen as being men.... Let me now again briefly enumerate these three intersections, this time emphasizing the "sources" of gynesis, so that we may begin to see more closely why this accusation is made. Then I will discuss one male theorist who has had a profound influence on both feminist and anti-feminist thinking in France: Jacques Lacan. I will be emphasizing his work, in such a brief way, less as written by the man named Lacan than as read by a new generation of men and women theorists in France. The Speaking Subject: The Positivities of Alienation 9 The "Other" has been the major preoccupation of French thought for the last fifty years. In the United States, at least until very recently, that term has most often evoked Sartrean phenomenology and the inevitability of inter-subjective warfare. But while Americans were busy reading Sartre, French intellectuals were re-reading Heidegger and Nietzsche, becom- ing obsessed with Mallarme, and the texts of such writers as Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot, and re-questioning Hegel's master/slave dialectic as elaborated in Koj"ve's reading. These rereadings and the theoretical outburst of what is loosely called "structuralist theory" interlocked unevenly, but progressed together steadily towards a radical redefinition of "alterity" which directly refuted that of Sartre. The phenomenological "Self and "Other" came to be seen as belonging with all of those Cartesian models of rational and scientific knowledge where "certainty" is located in the Ego - as "predator of the Other." And it is this Ego, no matter what its sex or ideological position, that came to be seen as responsible for our modern technological nightmare. It is also this Ego that the fictions of modernity (Artaud, Joyce, Mallarm&amp;, Beckett) have been seen as attempting to explode. The result of this recognition has been an accelerating exploration of Man's Non-Coincidence-With-Himself through new theories of alterity. And parallel to this retreat of the All-Too-Human-Subject (both male and female), there has been a re-genderization of the space where alterity is to be re-explored in language. The space "outside of" the conscious subject has always connoted the feminine in the history of Western thought - and any movement into alterity is a move- diff6rence (Paris: Seuil, 1967), p. 228; his references to an article by Barbara Johnson in "Envois" La carte postale (Paris: Flammarion, 1980), pp. 162-164; and his dialogue with Barbara Johnson ' propos of her paper on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in Les fins de I'homme (Paris: Galilee, 1981), pp. 75-88. 8See Helene Cixous, "I'Approche de Clarisse Lispector" in Poetique, No. 40 (1979). The reader might also want to refer to her brief interview with Michel Foucault on Marguerite Duras: "A prospos de Marguerite Duras: in Cahiers Renaud Barrault, No. 89. 91 am aware of the scandalous nature of using these "old words"- "positivities" and "alienation"- to qualify a general philosophical movement intent on abolishing both positivism and phenomenological theories of alienation (Entiusserung in Hegel). I am not sure whether the fact that these two words seem best to qualify a "certain teleology" of contemporary French thought is due to an extreme case of paleonymie (c.f. Derrida, Marges, La Dissemination and Positions) or whether the fact of such a general emphasis could seem obvious only to the feminist reader. diacritics / summer 1982 59</page><page sequence="7">ment into that female space; any attempt to give a place to that alterity within discourse involves a mise en discours de la femme. If an autonomous "I" or "he" can no longer exist then only an anonymous "she" will be seen to-as Heidegger might say-ex-sist. Thinking the Unrepresentable: The Displacement of Difference Representation is the condition that confirms the possibility of an imitation (mimesis) based on the dichotomy of presence and absence, the dichotomies of dialectical thinking (negativity). Representation, mimesis, and the dialectic are inseparable; they designate together a way of thinking as old as the West, a way of thinking which French thought, through German philosophy, has been attempting to re-think since the turn of the century. Between 1930-1960, the dialectic (and its modes of representation), as elaborated by the neo-Hegelians and redefined by the phenomenologists, was the major focus of French intel- lectuals and represented a major hope for reconstructing the world. An understanding of negativity- either as represented by the "Idealist" or as redefined by the "Marxist"- would bring about the possibility of building a general science of contradiction. But there soon sur- faced in France a movement towards redefining the functions of mediation elaborated by traditional Hegelians and Marxists, as well as a quickening sense of urgency about looking again at the relationship between those two systems of thought. That movement, which - ~ L * ~ B :r -- -, aR w g a~- - g - :? ~ ~ i~ I a a ~ ? a ~~i~~i ?a~ came into its full maturity after 1968, still pursues its quest for a conceptuality which would be non-dialectical, non-representational, and non-mimetic. The destructuration of the dialectic in France is, for our purposes here, where the pro- cess of gynesis becomes the clearest. For to de-structure or attempt to subvert the dialectic is to put the function of mediation into question. Lacan was the first to displace, slightly, the mediator in patriarchal culture-the father-from "reality" to the "symbolic," as well as the first to reconceptualize and re-emphasize new spaces "exceeding" the dialectic, twisting the dialectic into a knot. The philosophers-after-Lacan, especially Derrida, Deleuze, and Lyotard, were to displace mediation even further. The Aufhebung, recognized as mediating between Culture and Nature, Difference and Identity, is also seen as that which fundamen- tally defines Male and Female through hierarchization. Those philosophers will, therefore, in their radical displacement of mediation, set about a total reconceptualization of difference (beyond contradiction), self-consciously throwing both sexes into a metonymic confusion of gender. And, as with the demise of the Cartesian Ego, that which is "beyond the Father,"- overflowing the dialectics of representation, unrepresentable - will be gendered as feminine. The Demise of Experience: Fiction as Stranger than Truth? Disarmed of the cogito and the dialectic, lost in a maze of delegitimized narratives, any question of 'Truth" in/for modernity can only be a tentative one. It will therefore only con- 60</page><page sequence="8">cern us here to the extent that a certain definition of truth, based in an experience of reality, is intrinsic to feminism as a hermeneutic. That is, the notion that women's truth-in- experience-and-reality is and has always been different from men's and has consequently been devalued and always already delegitimized in patriarchal culture. And that if men are experiencing that delegitimation today, it can only be a positive step towards demystifying the politics of male sexuality.... The major battle, in the wake of Freud, Nietzsche, and Heidegger, has been to unravel the illusion that there exists a universal truth which can be proven by any so-called universal experience and/or logic. Truth, therefore, can equal neither "experience" nor "reality" as those words have been traditionally understood; and therefore any discourse basing itself in either one is, in truth, an age-old fiction. Henceforth, the theorists oflin modernity will begin a search for the potential spaces of a "truth" which would be neither true nor false; for a "truth" which would be in-vrai-semblable. For vraisemblance is the code word of our metaphysical heritage.1 "Truth" can thus only be thought through that which subverts it. The true must be thought strangely, outside of the metaphysical categories of opposition - or between them. This approach involves, first and foremost, a relinquishing of mastery- indeed, a valori- zation of non-mastery. Secondly, the true, to be isolated in those processes anterior to, or in some cases, beyond the Truth as produced by the Techn&amp;, is that which can never be seen, which never presents itself as such but rather captures, points, withdraws, hides itself in its veils: and that true is "woman"-the "non-truth" or "partial true" of Truth. Or, for others, "woman" is precisely that element which disturbs even that presupposition (Truth as castrated). Whatever the strange intricacies of these new wanderings through the demise of Truth- In-Experience, "woman" is that element most discursively present. Julia Kristeva has called this new element a vrdel [La Folle v6rit6, p. 11]- a kind of "she-truth." This "she-truth" has been put into discourse in new ways in France- hence the gynesis whose potential spaces I have had to outline so schematically here. The demise of the Sub- ject, of the Dialectic, and of Truth has left thinkers-in-modernity with a void which they are vaguely aware must be spoken differently, and strangely. As "woman." Or gynema ... Among Cartesian orphans, Lacan is one of the best known explorers of the spatial con- tours of gynesis. In his Seminar XX, entitled Encore, (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1975), he elaborates, elaborately, how and why "woman" is that which escapes any form of universal logic, how and why "woman is not All." That is, he shows how, as opposed to Universal Man (the Self of Humanist thought), "woman" may be seen as the anti-universal par excellence. Woman is not All; she is excluded by the nature of words and things. There is something chez elle which "escapes" discourse. But Lacan does not stop there. For if woman is not All, she nevertheless has access to what he calls a "supplementary jouissance"- beyond Man, beyond the Phallus. This "extra jouissance" is a substance, different from but not unrelated to "the quite expansive substance, complement of the other" described as "modern space": a "pure space, just as one says pure spirit" [p. 25]. Most importantly, this substance jouissante is of the order of the infinite; it can- not be understood consciously, dialectically, or in terms of Man's Truth - for it is what we have always called "God ..." "Feminine jouissance" will, therefore, be posited as the ultimate limit to any discourse articulated by Man. It is, however, only the first of a series of such limits, which, through metonymy, will all be gendered as feminine. For example, the limit of any discourse for Lacan is also the "true." Truth (capital T) can/could only exist as long as there is/was a belief in Universal Woman. The "true," like woman, is not All. And this "true," inter-dit, located as it is between words, between-the-lines, provides an access to what is perhaps the most impor- tant discursive limit for Lacan: the Real. 'OFrom a psychoanalytical perspective, Jean-Michel Ribettes has maintained that it is also particularly male, belonging as it does to an obsessional rather than hysterical economy. c.f.: "Le phalsus (Vrai/ semblant/vraisemblence du texte obsessionel" in La folle v6rit6, ed.

For not to treat it carefully is to misjudge the force of Lacan's twisting of the dialectic and to return to a nineteenth century Freud through the back door. In Lacanian literature, the Real has no ontological foundation. It "is" neither Reality, nor History, nor a Text. The Real designates that which is categorically unrepresentable, non- human, at the limits of the known; it is emptiness, the scream, the "zero-point" of death, the proximity of feminine jouissance. Further, the Real - like "feminine jouissance" and like the "true"- is imprevisible. Unseen and unforeseeable, it surges out of the unconscious, as terrifying as any God no matter what name the latter carries. Is the unconscious, then, going to be gendered as being as feminine as the other limits of the symbolic which it seems to hold in store for us? Yes. Woman as Other is "in relation- ship to what can be said of the unconscious, radically the Other, [. ..] that which has to do with this Other" [p. 75]. But if Man's unconscious is "woman," what about women's unconscious? Here we arrive inevitably at a question addressed to Lacan by a feminist, Luce Irigaray's "scandalous question": is woman the unconscious, or does she have one? " Lacan will reply: "Both"- but only with regard to the male subject. Irigaray will not be satisfied with that answer. But other women analysts will begin with this supposition in their attempt to define the "female sub- ject"-at the coordinates of writing by men and feminine jouissance. It is no accident that those analysts will confront that question through "literature." For is the modern question put to the literary text not the same as that asked about woman? Is literature our unconscious or does it have one? Lacan will again answer: "both." It has one to the extent that it does not know what it is saying. It is our unconscious to the extent that it is the space of literarity itself: lalangue, as the "cloud of language [which] makes [up] writing" [Lacan, p. 109]. Writing is that letter which escapes discourse as its "effect," just as lalangue is that which "is at the service of completely other things than communication" [p. 126]. Like the unconscious, the written text is a savoir faire with ialangue [p. 127]. This succession of feminine spaces is enough to make the woman reader dizzy. Is writing then going to be gendered as being as feminine as "feminine jouissance," the "true," the "Real," and the "unconscious"? Here Lacan stops. Beyond the realm of intersubjectivity, for Lacan, there can be no understanding. Lacan will call a halt to his feminine metonymy faced with literature itself- except to the extent that lalangue is necessarily maternal and that the "letter" always has what he calls a "feminizing effect" [c.f. "Litturaterre" in Litterature, No. 3, 1971]. In spite of Lacan's irritating paternalism, we must not forget that he consistently shied away from going beyond his own early warning that "the images and symbols chez la femme can never be separated from the images and symbols de la femme" [Lacan, Ecrits (Paris: Seuil, 1966), p. 728]. If"woman" in his thought designates that which subverts the Sub- ject, Representation, and Truth, it is because "she" does so in the history of Western thought. To assert that is perhaps to uncritically continue it. In any case, psychoanalysis alone can go no further than that recognition without rephenomenologizing its original conception. The next link in the feminine chain will be left to Lacan's Others. One of those is Eugenie Lemoine-Luccioni.12 She begins with Lacan's barring of univer- sal woman (the woman): woman is not All. Woman is divided, partitioned; that is her specificity. Further, that this division-in-herself marks woman's specificity means that aliena- tion is fundamental to her being-in-the-world (rather than merely fundamental to culture). For Lemoine-Luccioni - and this is the core of her argument - it is only this intrinsic partition- ing in/of woman that is capable of explaining what we have known about women from the beginning of time. Hers is an extreme Lacanian case of "The man will always . .. the woman will always" as Stephen Heath points out ["Difference" in Screen, Vol. 19, No. 3 (Autumn 1978)]. This division-in-herself explains woman's narcissism [Partage des femmes, p. 35]; why she can't create, "even as a painter" [p. 165]; why it is men who are the philosophers and poets "We've known that since Dante" [p. 10]. It, in fact, explains everything - from woman's S1c.f.

In her second book, Le r&amp;ve du cosmonaute, Lemoine-Luccioni goes even further. There, she insists on how women in fact incarnate Lacan's woman-spaces. Women exist within his "feminine jouissance" [Le reve du cosmonaute, p. 49]; they attain the Real "more surely" than men [p. 61]. It is, above all, women who engender lalangue upon which the symbolic order is founded and upon which it will always depend. Within this context, it comes as no surprise that feminism is denounced by Lemoine- Luccioni as a danger to the social contract itself. For if "woman" were to disappear, "so too would the symptom of man, as Lacan says. And with no more symptom, no more language, and therefore no more man either" [p. 10]. The only hope, therefore, is for women to revin- dicate, not their right to a discourse or to a look of their own, but rather to their difference-as- not-all. What then would be women's place in the world? If women incarnate "woman" as the problem of identity, the discontinuity of the social contract, the symptom of Man, then "why not count on them to assume the irreducible difference that resists unification, since woman is there, and the sexual difference is there as well, and since woman alone can be the figure of division?" [p. 182]. Saving the world would seem to be up to women ... ~4~4~~ ~""~ ~ a "i~ ?~ n - ii6~~ i I ~ D I " ?

Her analysis, while remaining strictly loyal to the Lacanian doxa, does not fall into the same anthropological com- monplaces as does that of Lemoine-Luccioni. This is in part because she is not primarily writing about women, but about something called "femininity." But it is also because she is closer to the literary text than Lemoine-Luccioni. Montrelay would seem to want to render Lacan's "woman" incarnate in a different way. Her "woman" is not partitioned, divided, in the world, but rather the locus of a "primary imaginary" dedicated to "feminine jouissance." And women are not necessarily closer to this primary imaginary than men. In fact, MWomen's books [only] speak of this 'feminine' imaginary which men - poets, among others- possess" [p. 155]. According to Montrelay, it is the male poets, not women, who have provided us with an access to that imaginary-through writing. Here is where Montrelay completes Lacan's feminine metonymy more thoroughly than Lemoine-Luccioni: "feminine jouissance can be understood as writing [... ] this jouissance and the literary text (which is also written like an orgasm produced within discourse) are the effect of the same murder of the signifier [. . .] Is it not for this reason that, with Bataille, Jarry, Jabes, writing portrays itself as the jouissance of a woman?" [pp. 80-81]. The list of male writers continues throughout Montrelay's book. Women, writing, "do not leave this feminine substance on the page"-as men do. In any case, it would seem encouraging that woman writers are gradually becoming "less feminist."

Somehow humanity must avoid the inevitable trauma of doing away with "woman" as man's symptom - if we are to avoid bringing the social order, the order of language, crashing down. Here we have reached a point where, if space permitted, we would want to 1. trace the trajectory of Lacan's "woman spaces" as unfolded by other male French theorists, even by those most overtly opposed to Lancanian analysis; and 2. follow how other women theorists, whatever their posture towards analysis, have, in varying degrees and from different political stances, insistently posited that women somehow incarnate those spaces. For example, if we were to return for a moment to the notion of writing-as-feminine, we would most certainly want to treat, at length, the work of the foremost theoretician of ecriture in France: Jacques Derrida.13 For there, Lancan's "feminine jouissance" (as not all, in excess, invisible, half-said), as "supplement," will be found to be intrinsic to a new, non-human, de-naturalized body: not that of woman, but of the text as ecriture. For Derrida and his disciples, the questions of how women might accede to subject- hood, write surviving texts, or acquire a signature of their own are the wrong questions- eminently phallogocentric questions. Rather, woman must be released from her metaphysical bondage and it is writing, as the locus of the "feminine operation," that can and does subvert the history of that metaphysics. The attributes of writing are the attributes of "woman"- that which disturbs the Subject, the Dialectic, and Truth is feminine in its essence. We would also want to look at the ways in which women theorists of ecriture, like those of Lacan's "feminine jouissance," have not hesitated to incarnate Derrida's "feminine opera- tion" by/in women, if in very different ways. Hle6ne Cixous names Derrida's "writing-as- feminine-locus-and-operation": I'6criture f6minine.14 And she goes on to posit that if "feminine writing" does not require the signature of a woman, women, today, nonetheless, do have a privileged access to it. For Sarah Kofman,15 women already incarnate Derrida's "feminine operation" (as undecidability, oscillation), an operation that will eventually put an end to all metaphysical oppositions, including that of men/women, and move towards a generalized feminine jouissance. For these women, feminism is hopelessly anachronistic, grounded in a (male) metaphysical logic which modernity has already begun to overthrow. I have tried to outline here some of the reasons why we might not want to qualify the "new directions" in contemporary French thought as feminist and, most especially, as femin- ist only when and because they are being developed by women. At the same time, I feel that French thought can be an extremely important interlocutor for what we call feminist literary criticism in the United States. For if, as I have only been able to suggest here, modernity represents a new kind of discursivity on/about/as woman (and women), a valorization and/ or speaking of "woman"; and if we, as American feminists, are going to take modernity and its theorists seriously; then feminist criticism has some new and complex questions to address itself to. Are gynesis and feminism in contradiction, or do they overlap and participate with each other in some way? In what ways might the texts of gynesis be reintroducing certain very familiar representations of women "in spite of themselves"? That is, to what extent is that pro- cess designated as feminine absolutely dependent on those representations? Might it be that to posit that process- beyond the Subject, the Dialectics of Representation, and Man's Truth - as a process incarnated by women is to fall back into the very anthropomorphic (or gynomorphic?) images that the thinkers of modernity are trying to disintegrate? 13 For Derrida's most extensive presentation of writing as "feminine operation," see his Eperons: les styles de Nietzsche (Paris: Flammarion, 1978). It has been translated into English as Spurs in the quatrilingual edition (Venice: Corbo e Fiore, 1976). 14Cixous' most extensive developments of &amp;criture f6minine as a concept have been in her seminars in Paris. But glimpses of the concept's debt to Derrida's work may be found, most particularly, in her "Le sexe ou la t~te?", Les cahiers du GRIF 13 (October 1976). s5c.f., in particular, Sarah Kofman's "Ca cloche" in Les fins de I'homme, op. cit. pp. 89-116. 64</page><page sequence="12">Most importantly, if modernity and feminism are not to become mutually exclusive- and, at the same time, if feminism is not to compromise the quality of its attention to female stereotyping of whatever kind -what will be our strategy for asking those questions, and others?
