<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRUTHFULNESS IN TEACHING THE TRUTH GERALD BIRNEY SMITH The Univwrsitnr of Chicago A teacher in a Sunday school decided to undertake with her class a thorough study of the Bible, book by book. The class began with Genesis. The teacher, a college graduate, in preparing to teach the first chapter, became aware that her scientific convictions were at variance with the details of the biblical account of creation. She wrote to a theological professor for a list of books on Genesis. After using these helps, she became convinced that many of the narratises in the book of Genesis are myth and folklore. She wished to be truthful in her teaching. What was the "truth" which she could "truthfully" affirm before her class ? A mother, one night after hearing her little girl repeat her prayers, was about to leave her, when the child asked: "Mamma, is God like a man ? Does he have eyes and hands ? Can he speak, and move ?" The mother felt scrupulous accuracy in one's conceptions to be a primary virtue. She immediately talked with the sleepy little one for an hour, trying to supplant the childish anthropomorphism by a philosophically adequate conception of God. She was certainly "truthful" in her endeavor. But did she teach the "truth" to her child ? The above instances both actual occurrences illustrate a per- plexing problem in religious education. Teachers and parents wish to be strictly truthful in matters of religion. But is this possible ? Or, if possible, how can it be attained ? To answer these questions, we must raise the familiar query: "What is truth ?" If we seek to define truth, we immediately find ourselves face to face with a bewildering elasticity in the use of the word. But there are three quite definite conceptions which have found their way into religious instruction; and each of the three presents its peculiar problems. For the sake of convenience, we may name these (I) absolutetruth; (2) historicaltruth; (3)spiritualtruth. Letusbriefly consider each conception with special reference to the duty of the teacher. 23I</page><page sequence="2">THE BIBLICAL TFORLD 232 One of the most familiar facts of experience is the constant delusion of ordinary observation. An event is observed by a dozen men. Each attempts to describe it. The result is an amazing discrepancy of statement, even when every man tries to be truthful. Our preju- dices, our special training, our life-interests, the physical state of our senses, all play so large a part that our apprehension of reality is conditioned by individual limitations. This biased testimony of the individual has been noted from time immemorial. The natural (corollary to this is the recognition of the untrustworthiness of human observation. From such a source we can obtain only imperfect views of truth. If, then, we are not to live in the control of error, we must search for absolute truth, freed from all the perversions of ordinary percep- tion. We must see things, not with the eye of man, but with the eye of omniscience. We must endeavor to step outside the subjective circle of our own thinking and know reality as it actually is, not as it seems to be. Such has been the argument of philosophers and theologians. But how can we thus transcend our own limitations ? There are various ways in which men have attempted this feat, such as ecstasy, mystic contemplation, and idealistic philosophizing. But these are within the reach of only a few choice spirits. The great world of common people demands a path more universally accessible. In Christianity this popular demand for an expression of absolute truth has found an answer in a doctrine of divine revelation, according to which God has conveyed to man the absolute truth, stated from the point of view of divine omniscience. It is true that the religious teacher has usually come into contact with this body of truth through the medium of some doctrinal interpretation. But such interpreta- tion is assumed to preserve the fundamental characteristics of the original revelation, and is, indeed, ordinarily identified with that original. It should be remembered, however, that the theologian has constantly in mind the perfectioff of the divine thoughts. He attempts therefore, to present his doctrines in a complete system, which, when judged according to logical canons, shall have no flaws. In fact, where revelation fails to speak with definiteness, the theologian pro-</page><page sequence="3">TRUTHFULNESS IN TEACHING THE TRUTH 233 ceeds to fill in the gap by a priori analysis of the perfect idea, which, by hypothesis, exists in the mind of God. There can be no doubt that many religious tcachers have some such conception of truth. In fact it has been the presupposition of most religious instruction down to the present day. In its most consistent form it meant memorizing of the catechism. In its more prevalent modified form it means carrying children through formal explanations of the entire range of theology, including such doctrines as predestina- tion, the Trinity, and the atonement, with all their abstruse refine- ments. The conscientious teacher feels it to be essential to lift chrldren above their crude ideas concerning religion into the realm of absolute truth, which, being once correctly learned, need never be revised. In this way the foundations of religion are felt to be made secure. The defects of the catechetical method of instruction have been abundantly disclosed by modern books on pedagogy. The method rests upon the assumption that truth can be accurately expressed in language, and thus "conveyed" from one mind to another. But a very little reflection suffices to show that language is only a rather clumsy device for stimulating thought. It " conveys " nothing. There can be no doubt, for example, that Hegel believed himself to have given expression to absolute truth in more accurate terms than any other philosopher. But to the ordinary man Hegel's elaborate definitions are meaningless aggregations of words. The sentences "convey" absolutely no thought. If, now, we were com- pelled to familiarize ourselves with these formulas, we should, unless we were intellectually capable of paralleling Hegel's speculations, merely repeat the phrases like parrots. Whatever meaning we might derive would be so fragmentary, so colored by our own limita- tions, that, on the supposition that Hegelianism is " absolute " truth, we should be falling into error through inevitable misinterpretation of the Hegelian phraseology. The problem of education is made clearer if for the word " truth" we substitute the word "reality." The most perfect definition, if it does not bring one into contact with reaZity, is an unfit means of education. May I refer to a bit of my own childhood experience to illustrate this point ?</page><page sequence="4">THE BIBLICAL WORLD 234 I began the study of geography under the guidance of a bookish teacher, whose chief aim was to secure from the children an accurate reproduction of the contents of the textbook. My first lesson con- sisted in learning definitions of the scope and purpose of geography as a science. I learned the formally exact statements verbatim, without the slightest suspicion that I was entering upon a branch of learning which had relations to anything real. For months I mechani- cally learned definitions and located places on the map simply to fulfil a tiresome and unmeaning daily task. In the eyes of my teacher I was learning "truth," in "truthful" forms. As a matter of fact, I was spending my energies upon an utterly unreal world of symbols. Now, in the realm of geography the moral and spiritual damage of educating one in unreality is not so great. But what about the realm of religion? Can there be any more appalling mistake here than to bring children into contact with unreality? If in the day school the boy or girl is made to feel the vital reality of the subjects which he studies, while in the Sunday school he is led to contemplate a realm of doctrine about which he understands little and cares less, are we not heading the child straight for a period of revolt ? One of the most significant features of our age is the number of persons who ought, by character and environment, to be active in religious faith and service, but who are convinced that the churches are devot- ing their energies to the defense of an empty structure of verbal technicalities. Such persons are often the natural products of an ideal of religious instruction which failed to bring them, as children, into contact with reality. We may, then, formulate the principle which should guide the teacher as follows: Bri¢g childre¢ into touch with what is real to them. It is far better to leave untouched many aspects of Christian truth for later discovery when these may be felt to be real, than to give the aspect of artificiality to religion. Just as a young woman may become blasee through premature acquaintance with the most profound spiritual realities, if she be too early and too frequently allowed to learn from the theater, the novel, and the art gallery, so we may defraud a soul of the fresh joy of timely discovery of religious reality, if we make meaningless through premature use the formulas in which more mature religious experience naturally finds expression. This</page><page sequence="5">TRUTHFULNESS IN TEACHING THE TRUTH 235 means that the attempt to teach "absolute" truth is both impossible of attainment and disastrous for religious life. The first duty of the teacher is to arouse a sense of reality rather than to impart mere correct information. The so-called exact definitions of truth are symbols of a reality far more fundamental than any theological formulation. If they actually make us feel the power of that realitv, well and good. If not, some less accurate symbol may be a more " truthful " means of attaining the desired end. Theological accuracy, therefore, is to be made secondary to the higher aim of making religion real. II A second problem for the religious teacher grows out of the fact that the main textbook employed in our instruction contains the his- torical literature of the nation from which Christianity arose. In former generations the narratives of the Bible were regarded as accur- ate history. Recent scholarship, however, has brought to our attention the fact that the books of the Bible were composed by various literary methods, so that parable, poetry, apocalyptic vision, and folklore are found. Presupposing this view of the Bible, what does "truth- fulness" require in cases where the lesson narrates an event which, in the opinion of the teacher, is not actual history ? This problem, which is now becoming acute in Sunday-school circles in the teaching of the Book of Genesis, is really another phase of the question concerning " absolute " truth. Exactly as in the older catechetical method, the attempt was made to put children into possession of doctrines which need never be radically revised, so here the desire is to acquaint children with history which need not be reconstructed. In both cases there is the laudable desire to pre- serve the child from disastrous skepticism, to give him a positive foundation for faith which will last through life. We may notice, in passing, that this problem of historical truth does not arise in those portions of the Bible which are in most fre- quent use. I refer to the psalms and to the parables. The frank recognition of poetic symbol or of fable in these cases does not in the least obscure the "truth" which they teach. It is only in those portions of Scripture which have traditionally been regarded as actual history that the perplexity arises. And here the primarv</page><page sequence="6">236 THE BIBLICAL WORLD element is the dread lest any admission of lack of historicity may induce in the child's mind the conclusion that the Bible is not a supremely truthful book. Much of what was said in the previous section is pertinent here. The passion for accuracy is characteristic of mature minds. Just as the philosopher desires to find a logically complete definition which shall be free from all the inaccuracies of uncritical observation, so the historian desires to penetrate back of what men report to the actual event itself. In both cases it is felt that a knowledge of the "thing- in-itself" is essential. Only thus do we attain final truth. Now, the distinction between appearance and reality so important for the philosopher, and the distinction between report and actual occurrence so important for the historian, constitute problems only for critical minds. But for a mind without critical training such considerations are very vague. In one respect those who hesitate to raise problems of historical accuracy are right. To make promi- nent a discussion of the historicity of certain narratives would cer- tainly mean a deadening of religious interest. What more academic and uninteresting exercise could be imagined than to attempt to bring children to a proper conclusion as to whether Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are real historical characters or not? Here, again, we shall gain clearness in our conception of the problem if we substitute the word "reality" for the more critical word "truth." What is real for children concerning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ? Evidently the traits of character and action which appear on the surface of the narratives. And these are just as real whether the narrative be fact or fiction. A little reflection will show that the problem is not unique in the teaching of biblical literature. Children are fed upon the myths and folklore of other literatures in the public schools. In general, they are not concerned to learn whether these legends are records of actual events. If the stories stimulate the imagination so as to appeal to that element of experience most real to a child the sense of activity -they become a real asset of life. Of course, when the question is asked concerning the historical truth of such a bit of literature, the teacher does not attempt to mislead the child. But the suggestion of a symbolic or poetical form of truth does not bring disturbance. The</page><page sequence="7">TRUTHFULNESS IN TEACHING THE TRUTH 237 spiritual power of the legend remains just because it is of the imagina- tive type which appeals most vigorous]y to the child-mind. The only reason why teachers cannot make the same educational use of legend, fable, and myth in the Bible as in other literatures is because a traditional conviction concerning the historical accuracy of these stories in the Bible has been so identified with the doctrine of inspiration that denial of historicity seems equivalent to denial of inspiration. But the inspiration of the parables is not thus involved in the question of their literary form. Devout scholars who regard the historical element in Genesis as very slight find that the book in no way loses its religious sublimity because of this critical conclusion. The teacher who sympathizes with current critical conclusions need not fear lest thereby she may be led to deny the religious value of those stories which for ages have been the delight of children, and which have perhaps had quite as much influence in forming early conceptions of God as have all the rest of the books of the Bible combined. It is the reality of the relation of men to God which is foremost here. And this relationship, if it is to be real to a child, must be depicted in anthropomorphic fashion. Anthropomorphism may not be "absolute truth." The stories in Genesis may not be records of "absolute" fact. But a vigorous, stirring child, whose entire world is concrete and animistic, will perhaps gain more definite contact with religious reality through these confessedly pictorial stories than would be possible in any other way. If what has been said be true, the teacher is to apply in the case of historical accuracy the same principle as in the case of philosophi- cal exactness. The sense of reality is of primary importance. In so far as the question of historicity directly affects this sense of reality on the child's part, it should be carefully considered. But if raising the critical question of exact fact transforms a narrative from a source of vital interest into a problem of academic debate, the teacher has exchanged the task of religious instruction for that of scientific infor- mation. It is only when the question of historicity is present as a vital issue in the mind of a pupil that it assumes primary importance in religious instruction. When it is thus raised, it must, of course, be frankly treated; but the final word even in this case should be concerning the spiritual truth which remains unaffected by critical</page><page sequence="8">238 TXE BIBLICAL Tf ORLD questions. Fortunately for the teacher, the fundamental purpose of the biblical book is homiletic. History is so narrated as to yield a moral or religious lesson. The primary aim of the biblical story is like the aim of a fable to present in pictorial form some spiritual truth so that through the power of vivid imagery it shall arouse the inner life of the reader. Since this spiritual truth constitutes the primary teaching of the Bible, truthfulness in religious instruction will require emphasis on this element. Questions of historical accu- racx should be subsidiary to this main purpose. III We have already, in a measure, anticipated what is to be said concerning the third ideal that of spiritual truth. Truth in this sense means conformity to an ideal rather than exact acquaintance with fact. WIany a man whose theological and historical conceptions are far from true, has nevertheless a quality of life which is admirable. And it is quite likely that this life has at least in the opinion of the man himself been nourished on these very erroneous beliefs. Sta- tistics which have been gathered concerning conversions indicate that the doctrinal content of the convert's mind has far less to do with the genuineness of his religious experience han have certain sub- jective qualities of mind and heart. Truthfulness in this realm means the moral surrender of self to the ideal which one knows to have rightful demands on one's allegiance. It is of far more impor- tance to act upon the basis of present convictionst imperfect though these may be, than to neglect the element of decisive action which alone can make truth anything more than an academic affair. Truthfulness, then, in the realm of spiritual life, will consist in a constant determination to place the right ideals before children rather than in the attempt to secure correct ideas. In fact, we may be per- fectly sure that a child's ideas concerning God, Christ, heaven, and other fundamentals will be incorrect often absurdly so. Ideas are inevitably limited by personal experience, and can contain only those elements which experience has made real. Such being the case, the wise teacher will enter into the child's world, will accept the childish point of view, and will confine his efforts to the supreme</page><page sequence="9">TRUTHFULNESS IN TEACHING THE TRUTH 239 task of introducing into that world of crude ideas certain aspirations toward the practical virtues within the child's reach. As has been suggested, this is precisely what the great teachers and prophets of the Bible stand for. Many biblical ideas are crude and imperfect from the modern point of view. No attempt was made by inspired writers to correct the primitive science of the times. But the biblical ideas, set forth often in terms of imperfect science, have always led men to the truth. The religious teacher will be most truthfully teaching the Bible, if he emphasize what is of supreme importance in the Bible viz., moral truth; the conformity of will to right ideals. The conformity of mind to correct definitions is a second- arv matter. It will be objected that such a toleration of theological inaccuracy as has been advocated means a lack of genuine belief in the sacred- ness of Christian truth. Ought not children to be rightly indoc- trinated, so as to avoid the disaster of religious error ? The reply to this objection is simple. It consists in affirming the principle which Jesus constantly made fundamental that the well- fare of a person outweighs the integrity of any institution or ritual or doctrinal system. "The sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath." Instead of employing the scribe's method of accurate interpretation of authoritative teachings, Jesus spoke in parable and simile. He was concerned exclusively with the problem of rousing men to a higher life; and because dramatic portrayal of life itself was most potent, he employed a literary vehicle which adjusted itself to anv road to be traveled, instead of the rigid theolo- gical conveyance of the scribesj which could advance over only one route. The truthfulness of Jesus is not the accuracy of the scientist, but the clear vision of the seer; not the painful exactness of the copyist, but the masterful stroke of the artist; not the finished logic of the systematizer, but the vital insight of the lover of men. And the truth which Jesus brought was himself the Way, the Truth, and the Life. How different from the truth of a doctrinal system ! If, then, the teacher makes the spiritual life of children the prime concern, and strives to induce a sense of the reality of such spiritual life, he will be true to the mission of Jesus. Higher truth than this cannot be found.</page></plain_text>
