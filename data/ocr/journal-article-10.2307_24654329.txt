<plain_text><page sequence="1">Practical Philosophy as a Model of the Human Sciences HANS-GEORG GADAMER University of Heidelberg The title of my talk today could serve as a heading for this whole con ference. It is evident that the expression "human sciences" is prob lematic for us today and that we must come to the conclusion that science should be defined by us in another way than it is for modern times. This, of course, includes a certain justification of the older Greek conception of knowledge as "philosophy." It is not because of my special predilection for the Greeks that I propose this topic for today, but rather because of the necessity of seeking an epistemological self understanding which is not based on the credence of the natural sciences and of the ideal of method as it was characteristically called at the beginning of the seventeenth century and as it dominates the research work and our academic activities in the humanities. It is for this reason alone that I want to go back to the philosophy of Aristotle, for it is this ancient philosopher who defended for the first time a special approach to the subjects of human action and human institutions. That it makes sense to investigate from this point of view the methodological impasses of our contemporary situation seems to me quite well illustrated by the meeting for which we have gathered together today. We have seen how the problem has already been ex pressed by Professor Apel in connecting it with this almost doctrine-like radicalism of Max Weber and the whole question of value-free research 74</page><page sequence="2">Research in Phenomenology Volume IX 75 which serves to verify the distinction of public and private and the orientation of anything that is public to the model of what Husserl call ed "knowing for everybody." To this position we must ask: Is this not the expression of the conflict in our own self-understanding rather than the solution to this problem? No humanist, no follower of the sciences that we call Geisteswissenschaften, can be described in his own doing and his own ideals under the point of view of value-free science. That is so self-evident that I find it necessary to reconsider the whole question of the humanistic tradition and its function in our modern culture. It is certainly a very ambiguous situation in which the humanities have continued their activities since the beginning of modern humanism in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is not very comfortable to choose between the rhetorical tradition of the artes liberales or to side for a self-understanding that calls itself critical and methodical and tries to compete with the natural sciences. I am referring here to John Stuart Mill's well-known chapter in A System of Logic in which a naturalistic methodological ideal is assigned to the human sciences. It ends by say ing that the "moral sciences" (Geisteswissenschaften) constitute a field of modern sciences which can compete with the prognostic exactitude of meteorology. I think under this point of view the humanities have a very poor place and a very limited self-understanding compared with the fact that the contents which are treated and interpreted by the humanities have such a tremendous impact on the whole world view, on the whole moral attitude and on the expectations of society. Confronted with this modern ideal of methodical sciences, we cannot avoid seeking for the enterprise of reason in the humanities a better recognition than that of the procedures of modern science. Far from recommending something as a new method, I can but describe how the critical, methodical attitudes of modern investigation cooperate with another human tradition. To this end I proposed to resume the ex pression hermeneutics, which, of course, I take from Dilthey and Heidegger, and which is connected with the whole problematic of so called "historicism" — a philosophical situation which should also in form my own contribution to the subject. It is obvious that between Dilthey and Heidegger we have a very radical gap, even considering Heidegger's statement that he will con tinue in elaborating the scientific thoughts of Dilthey and of his philosophical friend Graf Yorck. Even when he had said that, the fact remains that Heidegger in Being and Time had called his own dimen sion of questioning a hermeneutics of facticity. Dilthey, as one of the</page><page sequence="3">76 Hans-Georg Gadamer Practical Philosophy as a Model great admirers of the positive sciences of the nineteenth century, one who was a dedicated admirer of Hermann von Helmholtz, the greatest figure of the University of Berlin at the time he accepted the call to Berlin, was nevertheless overwhelmed by the breadth and richness of the idealistic heritage. Hermeneutics, in his own eyes, was in the end the deciphering of the ideal book, the book of history, the book which was written by human culture in its ongoing process of authorship. So the new Heideggerian expression "hermeneutics of facticity" formulated a real challenge. If we examine the word "facticity," we see that "Faktizität" in German is no less artificial than "facticity" in English. This word is not a neologism of Heidegger, rather, it is an expression which originated in the theological discussions about the historicity of Jesus Christ and the resurrection. Of course, it is true that "fact" can be defined through the opposition to meaning, significance, interpretation, or theories as results of in vestigation. But to say that a fact is just a pure fact is, concerning its meaningfulness, the zero point of meaningfulness. It is not the fact but just the context which defines the meaning and the significance of a fact. When neo-Kantianism, the philosophical school which helped Max Weber to define his own enterprise, speaks about value relations in the humanities, then they raised the question: What is an historical fact? It is obvious that an historical fact is not, in the first place, merely something that really happened, but rather, something that really hap pened in such a way that it has a special signification for an historical question, an historical context. Of course, you may say that it is the same in the natural sciences. In deed, in the natural sciences the dimension of hermeneutics —i.e., of in terpreting the context which makes something meaningful — is now more or less accepted. We know that it is not sufficient to say that the natural sciences have to do with experimental facts and the humanities with interpreted facts. We know that the concept of fact in the ex perimental sciences involves a hermeneutical dimension because the pure increasing and augmenting of our experimental data does not con stitute advancement in scientific research work. It is the question which defines the meaningfulness of experimental data, and they, by answer ing a question, are "facts." To underline the concept of fact and facticity in the way in which Heidegger did makes us aware of the limitation of understanding and self-understanding in such a way that the idealistic heritage—this ultimate and highest ideal of Hegel to advance and reach the full</page><page sequence="4">Research in Phenomenology Volume IX 77 transparence of the object by its own merging with the intelligence of the thinking subject—can not adequately serve as a basis for the task of self-understanding. The whole idea of the philosophy of identity was no longer a sufficient basis for the new enterprise. It began with the re examination of Max Weber's methodology of the sciences. This great hero of my own youth, this man with his extreme radicalism insisted on an ideal of rationality which restricted scientific rationality to the ques tioning and seeking of answers in the technical realm of the relationship of means and ends. And so the new attempt to introduce the limitation of self understanding as the ontological structure of human Existenz becomes a decisive event. But we must not be misled by the application of the false rubric of irrationalism to this inquiry into human existence. It is to the French philosophers of our century that we owe this stigma of ex istentialism, and it is this situation, we can say, which serves to underscore the radical enterprise of a thinker like Heidegger and thus opens new ways for a better self-understanding of the humanities. We should recall here the leading ontological concepts with which Heideg ger deals in his well-known explanation of Vorhandenheit, Zuhandenheit, and Dasein. The English translations ("presence-at hand," "readiness-to-hand") are not acceptable to me. I cannot follow them because the German ear cannot hear in Vorhandenheit the Hand at all. And you, in the artificial translation "presence-at-hand" must of course realize the "Hand" in this context. As a matter of fact, Vorhandenheit is the opposite of hand, it is the dimension of data constituted by the experiment and by the measuring in the natural sciences which was formulated by Heidegger's expression; and his point of view was that objectivity and objectifying thinking is based on the dominating understanding of Being as "presence" in Western civilization. Initially, I did not realize that the practical philosophy of the Greeks could give us a new self-understanding under the point of view of science. But I think that at least Aristotle offers us a better under standing of human life than can modern science, so that, for example, we do not have to accept the calculation of the validity of historical research work, of history, under the point of view of methodical critical science as reasonable. One of the members of the circle of Vienna, Victor Kraft, in his book about the historical sciences, said that at best there is ten percent science in the work of the historian, and I think that is in a way quite adequate. But it is inadequate in the sense that ninety percent would be poetry or fiction. These are not exclusive alternatives.</page><page sequence="5">78 Hans-Georg Gadamer Practical Philosophy as a Model That is self-evident. Thus, the question for us is: How can we develop a concept of knowledge and science which really corresponds with what everyone is doing in the humanities? I cannot help but repeat again how, with respect to my own work, I was very far from introducing a new method in the humanities. It is quite evident that one must learn method to do the work of a humanist. I am, I hope, a good interpreter and a philologist. As a thinker I just wanted to propose a better understanding of what we are doing in the humanities; and perhaps that goes even further than do the humanities in the narrow sense of the word and encompasses the "sciences" as well. I must also recognize here the bold impetus for this direction opened by the phenomenological ap proach of Husserl. The success of words is perhaps the most reliable test for a real turning in thinking and so in the case of Husserl we have one such word, "life-world," "Lebenswelt. " This word is no mere neologism but as a term this word expresses the way in which Husserl attempted to expand the whole phenomenological approach beyond the limitations of scientific activities and to study the ordinary experience of life. So one of the standard achievements was his description of the structures of sense perception —for example, that we can never see at the very same moment the front and back of the sensuous object. But how does the philosophy of Aristotle lend itself to this discussion? How can the philosophical analysis of human life and human attitudes, human actions and human institutions by the ancient thinker con tribute to better understanding of what we are doing in the humanities? To ask such a question leads us to a certain re-understanding of the ongoing tradition of practical philosophy and rhetoric throughout the centuries. In reference to politics, in particular, I should mention that it was only in the post-Romantic era of the nineteenth century that politics ceased to be the title of a philosophical and methodical discipline. Since the beginning of this century we speak of "political science"; but I am not at all convinced that the scientific realm of political philosophy has been extended under this new rubric. Perhaps the older understanding of politics had a deeper relevance than we imagine. When we turn to the origins of this tradition in Aristotle we see that it was within a special situation of the Platonic academy that he developed his own position. Aristotle, the son of a physician, was oriented in his approach towards the phenomenon of life and to the model of move ment. The order of life as well as the order of the universe follow the model of the living organism. To be sure, on this point he was not ab solutely in opposition to the new Platonic project of a dialectical</page><page sequence="6">Research in Phenomenology Volume IX 19 elucidation of reality; but obviously there was a decisive difference be tween Plato and Aristotle regarding one crucial point, namely, the prevalence of mathematics in Plato, in contrast to the predominance of the model of the living body, of life, in the approach of Aristotle. It is not my concern here to speak about the common ground which Aristotle shares with Plato, especially on this question of the good, but merely to point out this difference which separates their respective pro jects. In part, we see this difference in the question of universals which was so sharply debated by Aristotle in his criticism of the theory of forms. Nevertheless, the Physics is an elaboration of the Platonic prog ram broached by Socrates' statement that he would not be content that he had understood reality as long as he failed to see the universe as being ordered the way it is because it is good for it to be so ordered. It is an anthropological and anthropomorphic model which governed Plato's as well as Aristotle's approach to physics. That is well-known. It is also well-known that Aristotle was not a founder of a system. We must realize that the concept of system is a very late epistemological concept which begins in the seventeenth century. It is provoked by the new con flict about which we are speaking, i.e., that the sciences claim to be the only reliable approach for an investigation into reality in such a way that the metaphysical tradition of two thousand years was suddenly deprived of its own legitimation. I think what we call a system in philosophy is just the attempt to bring together the contradictory ap proaches of the metaphysical tradition and of the new sciences. Although we do not speak of a system in Aristotle, his genius is un mistakable. In approaching human affairs he tried to describe what happens in human life and how we can clarity the foundations of our at titudes and of ov : »stitutions. And although there are indeed problems concerning the relationship between the Ethics and the Politics, it is not my concern here to describe the problems of these books to you. Yet there is one point that should be brought to our attention, namely, that no possible use of the words "public" and "private" is adequate to describe the difference between the subject matters of these two books. Both concern the public and both concern the life of the person as an individual. It is not my intention to recount how Aristotle describes the constitution of the city, the system of education and institutions or the formation of our ideas of moral virtue. Nor is it relevant here to see how Aristotle takes up the Socratic-Platonic notion that knowledge, giving an account, giving a justification by reason, is the decisive factor in the life of human society. I want, rather, to focus on the question; In what</page><page sequence="7">80 Hans-Georg Gadamer Practical Philosophy as a Model sense do these books about ethics and politics present us with a science? And along with this there is a further question: How did Aristotle understand his own activity as a teacher in this field? This second ques tion is not only Greek but almost contemporary, because it is related to the demand that philosophizing about ethical matters should have an ethical relevancy. This, seems to me to be a demand one cannot escape, even though we see the opposite in the analytic trend of British philosophy. But with thinkers like Kant or Hegel or Husserl or Scheler, one has to realize that their theoretical investigations in the field of practical philosophy will not only serve to advance theoretical clarity but must also have some impact on the clarity of decision-making and on our general orientation in practical and political life. That is a problem which indeed occupies Aristotle as well as all the other major figures. It is for Aristotle quite clear that to investigate the basis of the good life, of happiness, of virtue, of practical reason, should also contribute something to the goodness of human life. That is a very hard thing to accomplish. It is somewhat curious that the work done in the classroom claims to have an impact on our own practical life. Aristotle is well aware of this problem; that is, one of his presupposi tions—and I think it is a very reasonable presupposition—was that the formation of man by education must be done before one can begin to theorize about the practical attitudes and institutions of human life. Of course that does not mean that it is a certain unchangeable formation which is given by education. In any case, the main point is that theoriz ing about practical matters always involves a special risk —the risk that through this theorizing, which is always connected with a generalizing, the special case, the particular situation, comes to be seen in the light of general rules, so as to lose somewhat its own urgency and its own moral challenge. This inner tendency of our reason toward theorizing in sur passing our practical situations of action is deeply rooted in our capacity to distantiate everything linguistically. This was, I think, one of the deepest and profoundest insights of Plato, who never had the illusion that dialectic is able to overcome once and for all the emptiness of sophistic argumentations. In Aristotle too there is deep insight into the risk which is involved in theorizing, at least in the field of practice. It is evident that human beings apply their reason for fulfilling the demands and claims which are raised by the society in which they are living. And it is also quite evident that reason offers not only the confirmation for the validity of these prescriptions, not only the insight and the means to fulfill the order of society, but also</page><page sequence="8">Research in Phenomenology Volume IX 81 that it has the other possibility of distantiating from the moral and social rigour of the valid patterns. And so the whole question of the relationship between morality and reason is problematic for us. With respect to the tradition which tries to mediate this relationship, I think it was Kant who had the deepest in sight. I regret that in America the moral philosophy of Kant is not ap preciated in an adequate form and misunderstood as a morality of blind obedience to "duty." I would like to take this opportunity to make one point about Kant's moral philosophy as it concerns the function of reason in practical efforts. Kant was deeply influenced by Rousseau. There is a note in which Kant wrote "Rousseau hat mich zurecht gebracht, "Rousseau corrected me." His reference was to the ambition of the age of Enlightenment, the belief that by advancement of our civilization and of our scientific progresses culture and society are im proved. For Rousseau there is only corruption, not progress, to be got ten by civilization and it was through this challenge to the Enlighten ment that Rousseau "corrected" Kant. In his moral philosophy Kant tells us that the sensitiveness of moral conscience cannot be advanced by any philosophical efforts. The simple ordinary man who is honest and feels what his duties are has the highest degree of conscience and of reasoning. "It is a charming thing, this man of innocence, but the in nocence of a man who knows what his duty is, is so easily corrupted." It is easily corrupted by what Kant calls the dialectic of practical reason; by this he means that practical reason, the reason in practical efforts, is always eager to lower the demands of the moral and political claims; i.e., to find a new argument for the special situation in which one finds oneself so that it would be justifiable to lower these claims and thus find an escape from the special obligation. We know the answer which Kant gave to this dialectic of practical reason—viz., the categorial im perative. This famous formulation serves to suppress the sophistic of our passions. It is nothing else than the demonstration that the exception to the law cannot be admitted by reason. Let us return to Aristotle, because as a matter of fact I think we should learn from both, for the same problem occurs in Aristotle. When Aristotle maintains that education should not be done in the classroom, but should be presupposed, he means that one should not be educated in an intellectual way so that one would pretend superiority in a moral sense. This presupposition of Aristotle is in a way quite adequate to the only description of moral reasoning in his analysis. I am referring here to phronesis, this habit of practical reasoning, this virtue which preserves us against corruption by emotional impacts. On the one hand,</page><page sequence="9">82 Hans-Georg Gadamer Practical Philosophy as a Model this practical reasoning corresponds to Max Weber's idea of finding the right means to ends. But on the other hand practical reason must give account of the end itself and of why we have to prefer something to something else; and, so far as we do so, we are not blind to prescrip tions. We try to find the best, the good, in our decisions and this is always a very concrete thing. And not at all a blind obedience to the prescriptions of a society. It may be the case that it is good and moral, even politically justified, to go beyond the prescriptions of conventions. I should like to add here a remark about theorizing with respect to practical behavior. It is well-known that Greek epistemology or philosophy of science did not really discriminate between the two ex pressions for science episteme and techne. (It was just in the special con text of the Ethics that Aristotle discriminates between these two forms of knowledge: technical reasoning and mathematical demonstration.) Normally Aristotle followed the ordinary language and a special academic language in calling this enterprise of moral philosophy too episteme or techne. But it is very easy to see the problem. We have techne in the narrow sense of the word in what we call craftsmanship and all forms of expertise, and techne or episteme is introduced in the practical philosophy in terms of an architecture of this system of sciences in which the highest science is politics because it encompasses the whole subordinated professions and forms of knowing. So this well known system of sciences in the ancient sense, which was already developed in the Platonic dialogues, continues in the Aristotelian description. But he raises a new question: what does it mean that what is found in learning, in craftsmanship or in mathematics, in strategy or in writing is subordinated to politics? Is politics just an expertise of certain technicians of human life and is there a way to teach virtue and to teach in the field of political decision-making—to teach in the sense of con veying a certain knowledge, the truth, to which the pupil can refer as something reliable? Obviously not. Well, to this extent "politics" as moral philosophy can not be a techne and teach a set of rules, for to do so would overlook the function of phronesis which is just the application of more or less vague ideals of virtues and attitudes to the concrete de mand of the situation. Moreover, this application can not evolve by mere rules but is something which must be done by the reasoning man himself. That is my point: This application, this concretization of the general is the universal aspect of hermeneutics. To understand in concreto what the text in general says, that is the task of the jurist in applying law, that</page><page sequence="10">Research in Phenomenology Volume IX 83 is the task of the teacher in explaining the message of the Bible; and for it one needs "prudence." In whatever connection, the application of rules can never be done by rules. In this we have just one alternative, to do it correctly or to be stupid. That is that! Returning to our problem, we must try to see more precisely what "practical philosophy" entails. We appear to have an impasse. On the one hand we have the clear evidence that practical decision-making and reasoning is not dependant merely on generalities but must be con cretized by our practical reasoning and application. On the other hand, there is the game of theoretical description. Aristotle insists that it has a subordinate function. He tells us that it is like the man who tries to hit the goal as an archer, and Aristotle compares his own function with this man. When one tries to hit a goal one tries to concentrate on a special target, like this nail in the wall, just as every hunter when he hunts a deer tries to hit a special point. The hunter and the archer concentrate on a little piece of the whole. Aristotle would say that there is this nail in the wall, this target, so that it is easier to hit the center; that is not, however the full art of this sport but just an addition so as to make it easier. And so, with respect to hermeneutics and the humanities as a whole we have the task of subordinating both our scientific contribution to the cultural heritage and academic education to a more fundamental pro ject of letting the tradition speak to us. The best definition for hermeneutics is; to let what is alienated by the character of the written word or by the character of being distantiated by cultural or historical distances speak again. This is hermeneutics: to let what seems to be far and alienated speak again. But in all the effort to bring the far near that we make by methodical investigation, in all that we learn and do in the humanities, we should never forget that the ultimate justification or end is to bring it near so that it speaks in a new voice. Moreover, it should speak not only in a new voice but in a clearer voice. I would say that the best interpretation should be defined by the fact that one is able to forget it afterwards in the way that one reads the interpreted texts with a certain feeling of self-evidence so that one can resume their own interests, share their own problems, and ask their own questions in order to find a better solution. That, of course, does not happen very often, but it is the hermeneutical ambition. At any rate the convincing interpretation is one which acquires the quality of self-evidence. With respect to the practical philosophy of Aristotle, it is important to underline one of the qualities of theory, namely, that a certain</page><page sequence="11">84 Hans-Georg Gadamer Practical Philosophy as a Model distantiation is helpful for overcoming a too one-sided commitment of the individual subject. But on the other hand, I think Aristotle was well aware — and in my eyes this is the most important point we have to learn from him and by this re-connection to the older tradition of the philosophy of science —that the preconditions for theorizing in such fields are not neutral objectifications, but articulations of pre-given and lived patterns of social life. So he describes very well what Verstehen, understanding, for example, means in practical situations. It is just the privilege of friends that they can give advice; to give advice involves prudence, it means to realize the full moral situation of the other. That is what we call empathy or sympathy, something which is necessary for understanding under a moral point of view. Without it our effort of understanding would not, for example, see the conditions of life by which somebody failed and thus could not offer genuine advice. This is one of the points I wanted to add to the general description of the problem of the humanities we are dealing with today. I would call it solidarity. When I say that just friends are able to give good advice, I take this to mean that the concept of friendship should be expanded as much as the concept of communicative understanding. And what does a society mean without patterns of self-evident solidarity between human beings, neighbors, members of a family, colleagues in a profession—in every case, a common basis of solidarity? I would say that Aristotle was well aware of this point for any theoretical and conceptual work in ethics and politics. Politics, of course, means not only practice, e.g. of political action or political debate; but there is also the study of the in stitutions—the well-known content of a tremendous research work of Aristotle. Nevertheless, it remains indubitable for Aristotle that the point is not to enrich theoretical insight for its own sake but to apply this knowledge in a reasonable way in the given circumstances of a given situation. That is the work of political prudence alone. So, I come back to my initial set of problems. I think we must try to realize how these special conditions which Aristotle works out corres pond to the forms in which our reasoning is embedded in our own lines of life, of past, of historical memory and so on. How would Aristotle react to the way in which we put forth new proposals for our political problems? Certainly, he would agree with us that the professional constitution makers are not the right men for developing our practical reason and the rationality of our social behavior. We have to learn from our own needs and from the practice of our own life how to find generalities and to make institutions which promote what is best.</page><page sequence="12">Research in Phenomenology Volume IX 85 These issues point toward the possibility of better self-understanding in the humanities, an understanding that it is not a matter of mastering matters by information but of trying to participate in our social life and in the heritage of our culture. I heard one day that a Japanese scholar, who was a great admirer of Heidegger, was disappointed because in reading my book he felt excluded, since I insisted so much on the basic grounds of practice and of living in our own tradition. But I think he was wrong. Tradition is not a privilege of Western culture; the dialogue between tradition as well as the dialogue between our past and our tradition is expanding beyond any pregiven limitations. As other cultures are now leaning towards our culture, I think the dialogue or the communicative understanding between them acquires more and more the common ground of human life that is needed for comprehensive partnership and for the general interests of mankind in economics, in energy problems, and in the problems of preservation from catastrophic political developments. In all these things, we no longer pretend any form of exclusiveness and share with everybody our human task of contributing in the modest proportions which are ours to the well-being of human life.
