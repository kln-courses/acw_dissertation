<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW LOVEJOY'S ESSAYS IN THE HISTORY OF IDEAS BY THEODORE SPENCER ESSAYS IN THE HISTORY OP IDEAS. By Arthur 0. Lovejoy. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1948. 359 + xvii pp. 1 This volume contains sixteen articles, most of them published in peri- odicals during the last twenty years; they include about a fifth of the ar- ticles listed in the appended bibliography of Mr. Lovejoy's writings. The occasion of their publication is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the History of Ideas Club at Johns Hopkins University, a club which Mr. Lovejoy originated, and which, through a committee consisting of Professors D. C. Allen, George Boas and Ludwig Edelstein, thus appropri- ately honors him by giving renewed emphasis to the important aspect of scholarly concern with which his name is chiefly associated. The volume is both a unit in itself and a series of expansions of themes and theories which Mr. Lovejoy has developed elsewhere. Most of the articles are concerned with the eighteenth century-attitudes towards nature, primitivism and romanticism; there is an introductory general article on the "Historiography of Ideas," and the volume concludes with articles on Milton, St. Ambrose and Tertullian, the last two being sections from the uncompleted and unpublished second volume of A Documentary History of Primitivism and Related Ideas, by Mr. Lovejoy and Mr. George Boas. Mr. Lovejoy's main interest, in these essays as elsewhere, is to see that we have as clear as possible a picture of our intellectual past and as full as possible an understanding of the thinkers and writers who expressed it. He has given us, as Professor Allen points out in a foreword, a new insight into our intellectual heritage; he has made us aware of past schematizations, discriminations and conflicts so that not only are we directly fascinated and illumined by the analytical pictures of the past which he has drawn with such clarity, we are also indirectly influenced as we reflect on our present situations in the light of the past he has revealed. With each gen- eration our intellectual heritage changes; fresh analysis carves new facets, new intellectual tools reveal new articulations in its structure. Mr. Love- joy has been for our generation one of the most adroit and penetrating of analysts, and his intellectual tools have been among the sharpest of those which have helped us to visualize the features of our intellectual ancestors. First among them has been his gift for discriminating between different meanings of crucial words; the sixty-odd definitions of Nature in the present essay on " 'Nature' as an Aesthetic Norm" form a useful parallel to the 439</page><page sequence="2">440 THEODORE SPENCER list of different meanings of the same word which is appended to the first volume of the History of Primitivism. A tool of a similar kind is that which enables Mr. Lovejoy to take apart the large vague complexes-"ro- manticism," "primitivism," etc.-which we have been accustomed to use so loosely, and to clarify our concepts of them by determining their "unit- ideas"; it is hardly necessary to mention at this date that no student of intellectual history can have read Mr. Lovejoy's major works without hav- ing his own views permanently sharpened. In the present volume this analytical tool of Mr. lIovejoy's is to be seen (at least by the student of lit- erature) most clearly and excitingly at work in the essay "On the Discrim- ination of Romanticisms," where the author, after pointing out how con- fused is our present use of the word "Romantic," suggests that we may be able to clear the confusion by thinking not of one Romanticism but of sev- eral. He describes his analytical ideal as follows: Each of these Romanticisms-after they are first . . . roughly discrim- inated with respect to their representatives or their dates-should be re- solved, by a more thorough and discerning analysis than is yet customary, into its elements-into the several ideas and aesthetic susceptibilities of which it is composed. Only after these fundamental thought-factors or emotive strains in it are clearly discriminated and fairly exhaustively enu- merated, shall we be in a position to judge of the degree of its affinity with other complexes to which the same name has been applied, to see what tacit preconceptions or controlling motives or explicit contentions were common to any two or more of them, and wherein they manifested distinct and divergent tendencies. The remainder of the essay brilliantly illustrates this ideal by showing, among other things, that a "Romanticism" such as that of Joseph Warton's Enthusiast is a very different thing from the "Romanticism" of the German aesthetic theorists: Between the assertion of the superiority of 'nature' over conscious 'art' and that of the superiority of conscious art over mere 'nature'; between a way of thinking of which primitivism is of the essence and one of which the idea of perpetual self-transcendence is of the essence; between a funda- mental preference for simplicity-even though a 'wild' simplicity-and a fundamental preference for diversity and complexity; between the sort of ingenuous naivete characteristic of The Enthusiast and the sophisticated subtlety of the conception of romantic irony; between. these the antithesis is one of the most radical that modern taste and thought have to show. ... One of the widest and deepest-reaching lines of cleavage in modern thought has been more or less effectively concealed by a word. Mr. Lovejoy ends the essay with one of his several definitions of the function of the historian of ideas; for the purpose of the present discussion it is important to notice the following points; they are throughout basic to his interpretation of recorded human expression. 1) The categories, such as "Romantic," which have previously been used to distinguish and classify</page><page sequence="3">LOVEJOY 's Essays in the History of Ideas 441 movements in literature are far too rough, crude, and undiscriminating. 2) Hence the historian should attend, not to such large complexes of ideas, but to their simpler, "diversely combinable, intellectual and emotional com- ponents . . . that are the true elemental and dynamic factors in the history of thought and of art." 3) Such an acquaintance is necessary as a pre- liminary to any judgment of value, to any decision we make as to whether the preponderant effect of the diverse and often conflicting strains on, say, a given "romanticism" is morally or aesthetically good or bad. In fact, 4) When the preliminary task of analysis and detailed comparison has been made, it is doubtful "whether the larger question [the question of value] will seem to have much importance or meaning." 2 In discussing this definition, its aim and its illustration in the present collection of essays, I write from the standpoint of the student of liter- ature, and any apologies which Mr. Lovejoy, as a philosopher, may make for trespassing beyond his field must be doubly echoed by me. But Mr. Lovejoy's work, to the literary student, is of such great interest and im- portance, both in theory and practice, that it demands a serious examina- tion and evaluation. Hence on the present occasion I should like to dis- cuss, however briefly: a) just how it illuminates our understanding of literature; b) where it seems either inadequate or over-emphatic on a par- ticular side; and c) certain general questions which it raises concerning our response to literary art and literary aims. In one of the essays in this volume Mr. Lovejoy politely suggests that the conventional discipline of literary study has to a great extent lost its validity and vitality; the suggestion has frequently been made by others with more vehemence elsewhere. The editing of texts, the study of merely literary sourees, the tracing of the transmission of merely literary themes, themes of mere entertainment-all these scholarly games have seemed to haye less and less importance in a world of decreasing leisure and growing individual responsibility. Furthermore the material has been giving out. The study of literature has needed new subject matter, new methods, new depth and new vitality. Most of all it has needed a recognition, on the part of its practitioners, of its relationships, especially of its relation to the history of thought. Literature has too often been studied in a vacuum, and the main relationship that has appeared to be relevant has been the dubiously important one between the work of art and the private life of its creator. Mr. Lovejoy's approach, his emphasis on the importance of ideas, the persuasiveness of his learned analyses, have helped to put that sort of thing in its place. He has opened new avenues for investigation and new possibilities of understanding. An example, on a small scale, is the present essay on "Milton and the Paradox of the Fortunate Fall," in which a pas-</page><page sequence="4">442 THEODORE SPENCER sage in the twelfth book of Paradise Lost depicting the fall of Adam as the necessary preliminary to the redemption by Christ and hence as a fortunate rather than an unfortunate occurrence, is related to a long tradition of Christian thought which goes back at least to St. Ambrose. This sort of investigation is obviously much more relevant to Milton's own conscious intention than one which attempts to trace merely verbal parallels or other mnemonic phenomena. Even more important for the student of literature are such essays as those on the Schlegels and on Coleridge and Kant, for here the subject of discussion is not a single passage and the tracing of parallels, but the clarification of a central issue in the thought of the author. But though the study of the history of ideas can give, and has given, renewed vigor to the study of literature, though it offers a wider and wiser training than a discipline that is mainly philological, it cannot do everything, and when it tries to do too much, as it sometimes does in hands less skilled than Mr. Lovejoy's, it can produce as dry a harm as philology. There are certain authors, and they are usually authors who catch experi- ence at its liveliest, for the understanding and appreciation of whom the study of the history of ideas is irrelevant. That study does little to help us to read Chaucer correctly, for his only dealings with ideas are when he rather childishly and ineptly steals the platitudes of Boethius about fate and fortune, and it is of primary importance for only one kind of novelist, a rather rare kind. Defoe, Smollett and Dickens it leaves relatively un- touched. It is useful chiefly when we are dealing with didactic and critical authors; much lyrical poetry, though not all by any means, has little to do with it. Furthermore too much emphasis on it tends to obscure, if not to oblit- erate, aesthetic values. The common complaint against the historian of ideas is that he does not care whether an author is first-rate or fifth-rate so long as his work expresses characteristic or significant views. The answer to this complaint is, of course, that the historian is right not to care, since an inferior writer is valuable because he is likely to illustrate the standard opinions of his time uncontaminated by the originality of genius. But though this answer is quite valid, as far as the historian's goal is concerned, it leaves the seeker for a total view of literature dissatisfied; such a person is bound to be a little troubled, for example, by the attention which Mr. Lovejoy gives to a poem like Warton's Enthusiast. Important though it may be as a means for illustrating the feelings and opinions that compose one strand in the thought of its age, a poem like this seems, to the student seeking the total view, to receive more attention than its intrinsic merit as a work of art justifies, and he asks himself whether there is not an oppor- tunity here for misconception-realizing, as he does so, that he is looking at an irreconcilable split between himself and the historian. Mr. Lovejoy himself, of course, is thoroughly aware of these potential</page><page sequence="5">LOVEJOY 's Essays in the History of Ideas 443 limitations. In his introductory essay he makes it quite clear, by describ- ing the sort of scholarly project he has in mind as a present requirement- an edition of Paradise Lost annotated to reveal its intellectual background, a history of the development of the idea of evolution before Darwin-that aesthetic concerns and evaluations are not his goal, and, indirectly, that the study of the history of ideas is not an infallible or universal remedy for the difficulties facing the student anxious to achieve a total view of liter- ature. Nevertheless the implication, unquestionably present throughout these essays, that the understanding and analysis of unit-ideas is the major task of the student of literature tends to underestimate the importance of other elements in a work of art; the same implication is likely to give a misleading impression of how the mind of the imaginative writer works. The danger of the method is its rigidity, its coldness. The unit-ideas can sometimes be too clearly separated from each other by analysis; there are times when one is led to see them, unrealistically, as independent puppets, clashing and mingling on the stage of an author's mind, moved by invisible hands not his own. And, like so much that is said about the nature of a work of art, an emphasis on the history of ideas can make the artistic proc- ess seem a much more deliberate and self-conscious matter than it often is. However revealing the sixty-odd definitions of the word "Nature" may be to a later student, their enumeration, as far as an understanding of the minds of the authors who used the word are concerned, makes their use seem too cut and dried; it suggests an assortment, like different sizes of nail in a hardware store, from which the writer deliberately chose. Ac- tually, of course, he did nothing of the sort. The creative act is more supple than that; conception and the emotion that goes with it, tend to melt, or rather to fuse, intellectual definition into something that analysis cannot completely account for. 3 In a passage I have quoted above Mr. Lovejoy suggests that when we are dealing with the history of ideas as expressed in literature the task of analysis and detailed comparison is not only the most important but in the long run the only task it is worth while to perform; once it is performed, it is doubtful whether the larger question of the aesthetic or moral value of a given complex of ideas "will seem to have much importance or mean- ing."* The Present reviewer, trained in the school of Irving Babbitt, is unwilling to let such a statement pass unchallenged. Mr. Lovejoy con- vincingly corrects Babbitt's interpretation of Rousseau in one of the most penetrating of the essays in this volume, but to set Babbitt right in the reading of a text is not to prove, in the opinion of the present reviewer, that Babbitt's judgment of the effects of Romanticism, of the several Romanti- cisms he was dealing with, was wrong, or that he was wrong to include moral * See Editor's Note on p. 446 below.</page><page sequence="6">444 THEODORE SPENCER effect as one of the things to be looked for in the behavior of literature. Is the historian of ideas to say that all complexes of unit-ideas are of equal value for expressing the truth about human experience in artistic form? Two of the great unit-ideas which Mr. Lovejoy has so brilliantly described and differentiated-the Great Chain of Being and the theory of evolution- have had to find, so opposite are they, very different artistic forms for their expression, and it could be shown (though it would need considerable space) that the different forms have a different aesthetic effect and therefore a different aesthetic value; the authors who have interpreted the human situ- ation from one point of view or the other have interpreted it, morally as well as formally, in quite different ways. The Great Chain of Being, a root concept in the consciousness of both Shakespeare and Pope, could give each a basis for a vision of evil; Shakespeare's portrayal of the individual villainy of Iago and Pope's general condemnation of pride, are among the results. The theory of evolution, so dramatically opposed, as Mr. Lovejoy has shown, to the concept of the Great Chain, by removing or seeming to remove a permanent standard of value and a permanent pattern of relationships from the cosmos, has helped to destroy any basis for a vision of evil, and the moral thinness of contemporary literature is one of the consequences. In saying this I greatly oversimplify, of course, a most complicated matter. Let us take a more concrete example from one of Mr. Lovejoy's key authors, Milton. Partly under Mr. Lovejoy's influence, and certainly stimulated by his example, several scholars have recently described more completely and accurately than before the cosmological picture in Paradise Lost. We can see as clearly as Milton allows us to see, in terms of the cosmological ideas available at the time, what his picture of the universe was. But this admirable, and admirably performed, exercise in the history of ideas (and now I return to the point of view of our hypothetical student seeking the total view of a work of art) is not enough. It does not explain the central fact of Milton's cosmology: the fact that it is, at bottom, an imaginative failure. The universe of Dante is an imaginative success partly because its shape was for him inevitable; his use of it involved no doubts; his age supplied him with nothing else but the Ptolemaic image he so vividly portrayed. But Milton had to make a choice between three universes: the Ptolemaic, the Copernican and the Tychonian; he chose the one that was theologically most convenient and apparently most easy to visualize; unfor- tunately, it was scientifically out of date and the choice, combined with his own peculiarities of imagination, nearly wrecked his poem. The incon- sistency between the relatively sharp picture of the universe given by Milton himself in the earlier books and the ambiguity in such matters recommended in book eight by Raphael, is a serious flaw, and the attempt Milton requires of his reader to visualize certain details-the sphere of fire and the nature of chaos for example-can result only in images that are vague and blurred,</page><page sequence="7">LOVEJOY'S Essays in the History of Ideas 445 the sort of thing that never results from Dante 's descriptions, just as Dante spares us Milton's embarrassing anthropomorphism. It would seem, in other words, that our awareness of the back-ground of a unit-idea (the state of cosmological knowledge in Milton's day) here leads us inevitably to a judgment of value; or rather, what we make as a judgment of value (the clumsiness of Milton's picture) is explained by our awareness of the unit-idea. Knowledge of fact and judgment of effect are part of the same complex, and the total view should include both. We know that Milton had a choice to make; in terms of contemporary science he made it wrong. If we are not, perhaps, justified in assuming that a conse- quent sense of intellectual guilt made him fumble, we at least can see the unlucky results in his poem, and can have an aesthetic opinion accordingly. We are also led by his relations with science to some interesting specula- tions concerning the role of choice in the creation of a work of art. Is the artist more likely to write a successful poem when his basic " unit-ideas " are those which every serious thinker in his time unquestioningly accepts, so that his cosmology, say, is everyone's cosmology, and his general view of man's place in the scheme of things that which everyone believes in? The compari- son between Dante and Milton, if we make the violent omission of any consid- eration of the difference in their characters and the quality of their imagi- nations, would seem to make us assume so. Are we then to conclude that the greater the freedom of intellectual choice given to the artist by his age, the less likely he is to produce a major work of art? Is the spirit of un- limited enquiry, apparently so encouraging to artistic endeavor, really fatal to it? Is the final weapon of science against art the two-edged words "Be free"? The study of the history of ideas raises (among others) a further ques- tion of a quite different kind. Why and how does our appreciation and understanding of a work of art change when we learn that one of its central ideas was an intellectual commonplace at the time it was written ? When Mr. Lovejoy shows us, for example, that Milton's account of the fortunate- ness of Adam's fall was something that had been in the minds of theologians for centuries, why are we so interested, why does our own mind feel an extra satisfaction? Milton's meaning was clear enough already; does our knowl- edge that he was saying nothing new change the meaning or merely change our attitude towards it? If the latter, what does the change amount tO&amp; Mr. Lovejoy, in discussing another of Milton's ideas (p. 5), suggests that when we know that it was one of the most influential and widely-ramifying ideas in Western thought, "in this larger historical vista Milton's expres- sion of the idea gains a great enrichment of interest-an increase, so to say, of voluminosity." But what does this really mean? Why is voluminosity more interesting and satisfying than its opposite? There are several re- vealing layers in the human psyche to be laid bare before we call arrive at an adequate answer to questions like these.</page><page sequence="8">446 THEODORE SPENCER Such speculations may seem to be irrelevant to Mr. Lovejoy's subject matter, but if we think about that subject matter as something that concerns the present, the potentially creative present, as well,as the past, the irrele- vance disappears. It is one of the many great merits of Mr. Lovejoy's work, as I suggested at the beginning, that, though it is almost exclusively his- torical, the issues it raises are so fundamental and of such permanent sig- nificance, they are presented so cogently and so accurately analyzed, it is impossible for the reader who values the continuing life of art not to reflect on them in relation to immediate problems. There are times when one wishes that Mr. Lovejoy himself would do so; in the introductory essay, as in the conclusion of the Great Chain of Being, one would be grateful (one thinks at first) for a further kind of analysis than that which has already been given; an analysis not of past fact, but of contemporary resulting implications. But Mr. Lovejoy might reply that it is not the business of the historian of ideas to be concerned directly with the present; his concern should be wider and deeper, since its aim, like all scientific aims, is to create foundations of understanding that will make the past as permanently avail- able as possible, unobscured by the myopia of local peering. "Today we study the day before yesterday," says F. W. Maitland, "in order that yes- terday may not paralyze today and today may not paralyze tomorrow. " Harvard University. [Editor's Note: Mr. Lovejoy has written a comment (which will appear in our Jan. 1949 issue) on the above review, dealing particularly with the criticism expressed in the opening paragraph of part 3 (pp. 443 if. above). Mr. Lovejoy wishes to clear up a misunderstanding of what he meant by "the larger question." It was not "the question of value" put by Mr. Spencer, but (to quote a part of Mr. Lovejoy's comment) "It was the ques- tion of value applied to large, unanalyzed, undiscrirminated, historic com- plexes of ideas, as distinct from their 'simpler diversely combinable, intel- lectual and emotional components.' It is with respect to these latter and to them only (I observed), that the question of value has much meaning or importance.' "]</page></plain_text>
