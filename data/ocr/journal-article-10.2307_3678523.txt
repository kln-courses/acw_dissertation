<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION 1 (The Alexander Prize Essay) By S. B. CHRIMES, M.A., PH.D., F.R.HIsT.S. Read 14 June, 1934 IF an attempt were made to define the tendency of political thought in England during the fifteenth century, it would be destined to failure unless it gave expression to opposing views of the character of the time. Here, as elsewhere, the historian's most difficult task is to form not merely generalisations that will sum up part of the facts, but generalisations that will take account of all the facts, how- ever irreconcilable they may seem. The task of establishing general statements about the fifteenth century is especially troublesome, for the character of no century in English history is more open to conflicting interpretation. The reason for this conflict is not the so-called transitional aspect of the period, for every century is transitional, and every historical generalisation must express a transition of some sort. The source of the conflict goes much deeper than that, and is to be found rather in the sheer contradictoriness of our evidence. From one standpoint the most remarkable 1 I have three acknowledgments to make in connexion with the pre- paration of this essay. To Dr. Gaillard Lapsley I am indebted for many fruitful conversations upon the general theme, and for reading critically the manuscript of the essay prior to its printing; to Miss H. Cam, for some stimulating correspondence upon several aspects of the subject; and to Professor McIlwain, for his suggestive remarks in the relevant portions of his Growth of Political Thought in the West. Each of these scholars has contributed much to my own view, but I am not in entire agreement with the views of any of them. 11"7</page><page sequence="2">II8 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY features of the century seem to be its conservatism, its lack of originality, its old-fashionedness. We see in it the absence of new theories to explain new facts, and the vain effort to accommodate new facts to old theories. We see the leading figures of the time struggling like old men in a new world, forced to grapple fresh problems with old mentali- ties. The period then seems to us, as it did to Stubbs, " a worn-out helpless age, that calls for pity without sym- pathy, and yet balances weariness with something like regret " 1; we are led to regard it as a mere degenerate continuation of the fourteenth century, and see it as the bleak and barren winter of the mediaeval epoch. But from another standpoint its most striking features seem to be quite different. Its many anticipations of later ways of thought, its abundance of fruitful precedents, the novelty of many of its problems, are impressive. Its turbulent restlessness we feel must have been mental as well as practical. We note its literary activity, its intellectual con- tacts abroad, and the seeming modernity of many of its governmental forms, and we are thus led to think of it as the century of Friihhumanismus, of constitutional experiment and new monarchy, as the seed-time of the modern epoch. Now there is perhaps one tendency in the political thought of the fifteenth century a definition of which reflects both these interpretations, and that tendency was towards a change in its subject-matter. Political thought was becom- ing less exclusively a theory of monarchy, and more a theory of the state. This tendency is noticeable in many expres- sions of political concepts made by active politicians, even though theory was still shot through and through with notions of kingship. It is true that the theory of the only outstanding political thinker of the century, Fortescue, is essentially a theory of kingship rather than of the state, and of dominion rather than of kingship; yet it is also closely connected with a theory of what we should call the state, and there are indications, from the century as a whole, 1 Const. Hist., 5th ed., III, p. 638.</page><page sequence="3">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION II9 of the currency of a conception of the respublica, common- weal, or state, which transcends theory of a purely mon- archical derivation. Talk of the body politic, elaborate anthropomorphic conceits,' concern for the respublica A nglie 2 and the " whole weal publique," and questions of " politic governance " 3 are all characteristic of the period, and all are significant commonplaces of everyday political thought. Speculation on the mutual duties of king and subject was no less prominent then than before 4 ; but other topics were being canvassed: topics the discussion of which might one day radically affect that speculation. The utilitas regni and the public good 5 were being mooted, and these considerations were not far removed from the corrosive yet creative Reason of State, which, it has been well said, " has its roots deeper in time than we often imagine." 6 We can see, therefore, in the fifteenth century, the beginnings, at 1 Bishop Beaufort of Lincoln, the chancellor in the parliament of 1404, compared any realm to the body of a man, of which the left part resembled the Holy Church, the right part the Temporality, and the other members the Commonalty (Rot. Parl., III, p. 522). Thomas Chaundler, warden of New College and chancellor of Oxford, quoted Plutarch's comparison of the state to an organism, and applied the analogy to England, in a letter to Bekyngton, dated 6 January, 1452 (Official Correspondence of T. Bekyng- ton, Rolls S., I, pp. 267-8). Bishop Russell frequently used the phrase " public body " in the drafts of his parliamentary sermon of 1483. He also elaborated an anthropomorphic analogy (Grants of Edward V, Camden Society, 1854, p. xlvi). Cf. his passage on the " mistik or politike body of the congregacion of the peuple " (ibid., p. li). Cf. " corpus politicum " in Fortescue, De Laud., ch. xiii.

Maitland). 2 Official Correspondence of T. Bekyngton, Rolls S., I, p. 78; ibid., 267-8 (Chaundler's letter cited above, n. I) ; Gesta Henrici Quinti, 73, 107; Vita Henrici Quinti, ed. Hearne, 5.

Moreover, political thinking was becoming less abstract and universal, and more concrete and particular. Discussion was concerning itself not simply with respublica and kingship, but with the respublica Anglice and the English kingship. Far-reaching theoretical assertions were being bandied about, in the English tongue, in rebellious manifestos,x and in political tracts.2 The era of English political pamphleteer- ing had begun. Besides, a central clearing-house was now available for the exchange of political notions of all kinds, commonplace or original. In the parliament house at West- minster,3 many men--country squires and burgesses of rural towns, whose book-lore was small, and whose acquaintance with learned doctrines was very distant--heard the language and learnt the terms of political theorising, often, perhaps, for the very first time. Chancellor after chancellor ser- monised the parliament, and few of the faithful commons could have escaped these homilies without some political edification. Doubtless most of these parliamentary sermons contained little but orthodox and trite thought, but their important result was the diffusion of political concepts, phrases, and words among people from diverse parts of the country, many of whom had never before heard a political theory formulated, or concept enunciated, or formal con- tention stated. The theoretical education in politics of the plain man had begun. 1 See Scrope's Articles in Gascoigne, loc. cit., and in Inner Temple MSS. Petyt, loc. cit.

There may have been a good deal of informal thinking, and undoubtedly there was much repetition of political cliches. But only one man, so far as we know, wrote up, in a more or less systematic way, the results of his meditation on the political phenomenon, and he was no professional theorist, but a practising lawyer, an active politician, and a zealous dynastic partisan. The political theorising of Sir John Fortescue has to be taken as representative of the thought of his time, and as such needs close examination. For our estimate of the state of political ideas in fifteenth-century England must very largely rest upon our understanding of his work, and upon it as it really was, not as it seemed to the controversi- alists of the seventeenth and later centuries. The use made of Fortescue by both parties in the constitutional struggles of later centuries is standing testimony to the Janus-faced- ness of a publicist of a " transitional" era ; but the historian has too often assumed that the views of the winning party in those struggles were also substantially the views of Fortescue himself. The purpose of the present essay is to analyse the central doctrines of Fortescue's political theory, and to estimate their meaning as precisely as may be in modern language. I The outstanding facts of Fortescue's life are so sufficiently set out and so readily accessible in Plummer's introduction to his edition of The Governance of England that there is no need to recapitulate them here in any detail. The main outline of his career and the circumstances in which his chief works were composed have, however, an important bearing on our present purposes, since the work of no political writer can be accurately understood without reference to its setting. 1 C.

He was descended through a younger branch from a knightly family of Norman-Conquest origins, and was the son of an Agincourt warrior who was at one time governor of Meaux. He became, according to one authority, a member of Exeter College, Oxford, but a good deal of uncertainty attaches to this assertion. Whether or not he was ever at Oxford, his membership of Lincoln's Inn was undoubtedly the dominating factor in his education- he became decidedly an Inns of Court man. His early days at the bar are obscure, not least because very few lawyers except serjeants appear at that date in the Year-Book reports.' After his becoming a serjeant in 1429 or 1430, this obscurity diminishes; thenceforward there are many notices of his acquisition of property in various counties, and he figures frequently in the law reports. He acted as judge of assize in 1440 and 1441, and in the latter year was appointed a king's serjeant, an official whose duties resembled those of the modern Attorney- and Solicitor- General." He was promoted, in the following year, to be chief justice of the King's Bench, and was knighted soon afterwards. The new chief justice was concerned, during the next twenty or so years, with several cases of considerable con- stitutional and political importance, in addition to the ordinary routine business of the courts. He was connected with the trial of the duke of Suffolk in 145o ; he sat on the special commission in Kent in that year, was consulted in the famous Thorpe's case and on the duke of York's claim to the throne. Moreover, the latter part of this time was the period of his zealous Lancastrian partisanship, a partisan- ship which led him to throw in his lot with Queen Margaret 1 On this topic, and for the suggestion that the Year Books were closely connected with the body of serjeants, see T.

Fortescue showed himself, in these difficult and dangerous years, to be one of the most energetic counsellors and schemers of his party, and he took a prominent share in negotiating the alliance between Margaret and Warwick. But after the final defeat of the Lancastrians at Tewkesbury, he abandoned the lost cause, and in due time was pardoned by Edward IV. He secured, nevertheless, the reversal of his attainder and the restoration of his estates only on condition of writing a refutation of the arguments he had concocted against the Yorkist title. This task was hardly a very difficult one, and it was accomplished with success. The remainder of his days were spent in a certain-or rather, uncertain-amount of literary activity, and in the peaceful enjoyment of his extensive property. Fortescue's political thought is contained in three out- standing works. The first of these, the Opusculum de Natura Legis Naturv et de ejus censura in successione regnorum suprema, appears to have been written, probably in Scotland, between the years 1461-3. The work is in two parts, and the first of them is the most important and elaborate of his theoretical compositions and the most scholarly of all his works. It is ostensibly a discussion of the Law of Nature, but it contains much the fullest account we have of his political thought--there is no political doctrine of his to be found elsewhere in his writings, except in chap. xiii of the De Laudibus and its precis in The Governance, that is not to be found in this treatise. Nevertheless, it has been greatly neglected by historians, for several but insufficient reasons. It is a comparatively rare work. This first part exists in only two manuscripts, and both parts together in 1 C. Scofield, " Sir John Fortescue in February, 1461," E.H.R., 1912, pp. 321-3. Whether he joined the Queen just before or just after the battle of Towton is uncertain.</page><page sequence="8">124 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY only one, and neither was ever printed at all until 1864, when Lord Clermont published both parts privately. This version was superseded by that provided with notes and translation by Chichester Fortescue, later Lord Carlingford, in Lord Clermont's complete edition of his ancestor's works, published in 1869. Lord Clermont's edition, admirably executed though it was, is as limited in the number of its copies as it is exhausting in its bulk.' The De Natura, moreover, never figured in the controversies of a later age, as did Fortescue's other works, and it therefore has received neither the publicity of facile translation accorded to the De Laudibus nor the popular accessibility of The Governance in Plummer's edition. The provision of exact and con- venient texts of the De Natura and of the De Laudibus would supply a very desirable corrective of the false light in which Fortescue has been put by zealous and eloquent translators of the eighteenth century and later, and by the Whiggish learning of Plummer. The purpose subserved by the De Natura is the deter- mination of the right of succession in sovereign kingdoms (in supremis regnis). This right, it is decided at the start, can be settled only by reference to the law of nature, and the first part of the work is devoted to a discussion of this law. This discussion, however, leads to an account of the origin of kingship, of the types of kingship, of their differ- ences and resemblances, of the history of various monarchies, of the theory of law, and cognate themes. The light of the law of nature is shed, in the second part of the treatise, upon an imaginary instance of rival claims to the throne put forward by a late king's daughter, by his brother, and by his daughter's son. This second part forms the most extensive work on the succession question that was written during the period, perhaps that has ever been written, and together with the first part affords a unique and indispensable revelation of the mentality of the age. The 1 The Complete Works are limited to I20 copies, and are printed in one large volume.</page><page sequence="9">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION 125 arguments therein for and against the succession of the king's brother, to whom the law of nature ultimately gave it-as was indeed necessary for the advancement of the Lancastrian cause-are most elaborate and often very cogent, and illustrate effectively the extreme difficulty of the succession problem. The theory of kingship as a public office, and the theory of it as a piece of real property, the absence of any clear and consistent legal doctrine on the question, the consciousness of the inadequacy of the ordinary private law to determine it, and the groping after some ruling of what we should call public law, are outstanding features of the work. These characteristics make it by far the deepest, most interesting, and most important of all Fortescue's writings. This was his magnum opus; his other works were mere popularisers and tracts compared with this, which is solid, substantial, and learnedly argued. It is a treatise, not a eulogistic essay like the De Laudibus, nor a plea for administrative reform like The Governance. Upon this, rather than upon his better-known writings, Fortescue's reputation as a scholar and thinker must ultimately rest. His second main work, the De Laudibus Legum Anglice, was composed between 1468 and 1470, whilst he was still in exile on the Continent. It is in the form of a dialogue between himself and Prince Edward, and is mostly a work quite literally de laudibus; it is in praise, however, not only of the law and lawyers, but also of the people, stan- dards of life, and monarchy of England, especially to the disparagement of those of France. It also contains a repetition of some of the political theory of the De Natura, and in its crucial thirteenth chapter advances a theory of the origin of one type of kingship which has often been a source of comfort to Whiggish-minded historians, and to Tories a provocation to ingenuity. The De Laudibus has been a very popular work, both on account of the use made of it by the constitutionalists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and on account of its convenience as</page><page sequence="10">I26 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY a text for law students. It has been reprinted more than a dozen times since 1537. But, unfortunately, some of the constitutionalist aspirations of its earliest translators have clung to the work ever since; and the modern student is still obliged to read it in an inexpert translation made by Francis Grigor in 1737, and reprinted, without correction or comment, in a cheap form in 1917. The only modern Latin text available is that provided in Lord Clermont's ponderous tome, which, moreover, offers as a translation merely another reprint of Grigor's translation. This render- ing is decidedly free and stylish,' and has enlightened Fortescue's words with the liberal intuitions of the post- Glorious Revolution generation ever since it was published. A modern critical edition of the De Laudibus, as well as one of the De Natura, ought to figure in the list of desiderata which every acquisitive student makes for himself. The so-called Governance of England was the third com- position in Fortescue's trilogy, and was probably his last work. It comes from the period 1471-6, but whether it was written originally for Prince Edward and was later adapted for Edward IV, or whether it was initially com- posed for the king, is uncertain. It is the most disjointed of all his writings, and there is no evidence of its original title, if any. The title now adopted for it, which was invented by Stowe,2 is sufficiently vague to cover its miscel- laneous contents. The work opens with two or perhaps 1 Cf. especially the Latin original with Grigor's translation of chapters xiii, xviii, and xxxvii. It is, however, not so much verbal errors that make Grigor's translation objectionable, as the general impression it gives the reader. We are forced by it to read Fortescue through early eighteenth- century spectacles. 2 Plummer states (Governance, 86) that the title " Governance of England " is to be found in Yelverton MS. 35. But this statement appears to be erroneous. The title quoted from that manuscript by Bernard's Catalogue is " Questio quid digert inter dominium regale et dominium politicum et regale." The only manuscript that has the title " Sir John Fortescue upon the Governance of England " is B.M. Harleian 542, and this, as Plummer mentions, is in the handwriting of Stowe, who presumably invented the title.</page><page sequence="11">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION 127 three 1 brief theoretical chapters, which add nothing to his earlier expositions of political theory, and it passes on to make suggestions which have no relevance to these chapters : suggestions for the increase of the king's revenue, for the reform of the personnel of the council, and for the reduction of extravagance in the bestowal of rewards. The theoretical importance of The Governance is very slight, since in this respect it is little more than a summary of the author's previous compositions; it is not of any further constitutional significance, for no fresh question of rights is raised. The work is simply a tract of practical suggestions for administrative improvements, and resembles a memor- andum more than any other species of composition. It may well have been written originally as a political memor- andum similar to those known to have been composed by Fortescue at various times, and have been subsequently issued as a tract with three theoretical chapters prefixed to it. These three works contain all the evidence we have of Fortescue's political thought. His several avowedly dynastic tracts, and his own refutation of them, though of the greatest interest for a study of the succession problem, hardly contribute anything to the cardinal doctrines of his political theory. A certain pamphlet, generally called the Somnium Vigilantis,2 which has some political value, has been attributed to Fortescue, but with doubtful plausi- x Ch. i, " The Deference bi twene Dominion Regale and Dominion Politicum et Regale." Ch. ii, " Whi Oon King Regneth Regaliter and Another Politice et Regaliter." Ch. iii, " Here Bien Shewed the Fruytes of Jus Regale and the Fruytes of Jus Politicum et Regale." 2 J. P. Gilson suggests (E.H.R., I9II, p. 512) that this tract, which he there edited as " A Defence of the Proscription of the Yorkists in 1459," was written by Fortescue, on the grounds that it occurs in a manuscript volume containing other works undoubtedly by him, and that it was probably composed by a Lancastrian lawyer. Kingsford (Eng. Hilst. Lit., 167-8) thought this ascription plausible. But there is little to show that the tract was the work of a lawyer, and its English style, excessively latinised as it is, seems to differ notably from that of Fortescue's known English works. It may be his work, but the differences in vocabulary and style between it and Fortescue's known writings seem to be wellnigh fatal to the supposition.</page><page sequence="12">128 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY bility. Fortescue's other writings, legal and pietistic, and his Legal Judgments (usefully collected at the end of Lord Clermont's edition of the Works) do not concern our present aims.1 II The theory of dominion had a long history behind it at the time when Fortescue was writing, and we are bound to regard him as one in a series of exponents of that theory, and to set his doctrines in the perspective of antecedent usage and thought. The mediaeval theory of dominion was a theory maintaining the pre-ordained rightness of the relation of superior to inferior. It envisaged the whole of creation as the sum of parts which either served or were being served, by one another. The sources of this theory were ancient. Its root was to be found in Aristotle's theory of slavery and subjection, and its growth was profoundly influenced by doctrines of a feudal character. Germanic notions of land-tenure contributed to its development, and the theory thus modified went far to explain the typical feudal fusion of government with landownership, and to resolve the paradox involved in the common circumstance of the king's being supreme landlord without thereby cancel- ling all the proprietary rights of his subjects.2 Many subtle distinctions could be drawn from such a theory. All pro- perty might be considered as dominion, but it did not follow that all dominion conferred proprietary rights in the fullest sense, though it did in a restricted sense. Every dominion was a right of use, but not every right of use was dominion. Possession, which was the fruit of dominion, had to be distinguished from dominion or the right of use itself; for a man might grant a thing to the use of another whilst retaining the dominion to himself, and no one could 1 All references hereinafter to Fortescue's works are to Lord Clermont's edition, except those to The Governance, for which Plummer's edition is cited.

Thus both a king and his baron had dominion over a barony, but the barony was not their property equally; for the king's right of use of the barony was different from the baron's, and was restricted to what we should call public purposes. Nevertheless, the king had a proprietary right to his dominion, and there was a distinction between pro- perty that was dominion and property or right of use that was conferred by dominion, and also between dominion that was the right of use and possession that was actual use. It was thus possible to accord to the king proprietas dominii without prejudice to the proprietas rei dominatce of his subjects. The theory of dominion, in short, could reconcile the proprietary right of the king to rule with the proprietary rights of his subjects to possess. The king's dominion might limit for his subjects the exercise of their dominion, but not their dominion itself.' Such, in essence, was the fruitful theory of dominion as expounded by Richard Fitzralph, archbishop of Armagh, about a century before Fortescue wrote. Earlier still it had been elaborated, in more metaphysical and less juristic form, by Egidius Romanus, whom Fortescue actually cited as one of the authorities for his own classification of domi- nions. Wycliffe had made a version of the theory notorious about the time of Fortescue's birth. It is true that For- tescue did not provide any definition of the term " dominion " in his usage; but he gave a clear indication that dominion in the polities which he described had in it a strong element of full-blooded lordship over others ut servis to the use and benefit of the dominator. This, he said, citing St. Thomas, was the only dominion known outside the state of innocence. There were, indeed, on his own showing, three types of dominion, each with diverse 1 McIlwain, op. cit., 356-7; and Richard Armachani, De Pauperie Salvatoris, Lib.

K</page><page sequence="14">130 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY beneficial effects, but obviously none of these could be dominium in statu innocentiac.1 We cannot doubt that Fortescue used the term in much the same sense as his predecessors used it; to him its meaning was sufficiently obvious to call for no explicit explanation. To him, as to Fitzralph, it must have meant dominium ad bona unius regni sive regiminis unius domini super multos minores dominos. His usage of the term, to be sure, was not entirely consistent; he sometimes substituted for it the words " regimen," "principatus," or " regnum." 2 But " domi- nion " is the typical word in his writings, and his political theory is a theory of dominion. We ought, therefore, to eschew the common practice of translating his word " dominium " by the modern word " government." These words are not equivalent, for " domi- nium " has in it an element of lordship which the modern " government " has not. Fortescue's theory is primarily a theory of lordship,3 not of the state, and we do well to mark the fact by refraining from translating his terms into those of modern political science, and by calling his dominium simply and strictly what it is, namely, dominion. III Fortescue's political thought is descriptive rather than analytical, and its substance is a differentiation of types of dominion and an explanation of their origin. He distin- guished three types, and explained the origins of two of them. An analysis of these two themes exhausts all that is 1 What seems to be the nearest approach to a definition of dominion in Fortescue's writings is to be found in N.L.N., I, ch. xxxiv. 2 For the term " regimen," see regimen politicum (N.L.N., I, chs. xvi, xxvi, and De Laud., ch. xxxvi); regimen plurium (ibid., ch. xxiii); regimen regale et politicum (ibid., ch. xxxvi, and Govern., chs. i, ii) ; regimen tantum regale (De Laud., ch. xiv, and Govern., chs. i, ii).

He particularised the character- istics of the three dominions in varying detail. The regal dominion and the dominion regal and political were described with some fulness, but the political dominion was sketched very meagrely, and figures very much as a drone in the hive ruled by the mixed dominion as queen- bee. The differentiating features of the regal dominion were these. The head (ille preest) ruled according to such laws as he made himself, and his own thought was law. He possessed the realm in hereditary right ; the people could not legislate without his authority, and they were subject to his dignity. He could change the law and impose taxation without consulting them.' He was free to sin in the exercise of his dominion.2 Regal dominions such as this (regna tantum regaliter regulata) were exemplified in the ancient histories of Nimrod, Belus, and Ninus; in part of the history of the Roman empire; and in the monarchy desired by the Israelites.3 In more recent times, the king- dom of France afforded a most instructive example of this type.4 This dominion under good princes was like the kingdom of God, and many Christian princes ruled by its laws.6 But these features were lacking in the political dominion. Here the head ruled according to laws which the people had instituted (leges quas cives instituerunt). The political dominion, alone, admitted of a plurality of rulers; a regal dominion never did.7 Rome under the consuls was an example of this type of dominion.8 The third type was a combination of some of the features -nay, of the merits-of both the regal and the political dominions.9 Such a combination varied in its constituent 'N.L.N., I, ch. xvi. 2 Ibid., ch. xxvi. * Ibid., ch. xvi; De Laud., ch. xii; SGovern., ch. iii. 8 N.L.N., I, ch. xvi. 8 Ibid., I, ch. xvi.

Rome under the emperors was at one time a regal and political dominion; for though the emperor's wish was law for all his subjects, and though he did not always consult the senate nor inherit by hereditary right, yet he did rule for the benefit of the many (ad usum plurium). Israel, too, was a dominion political and regal, since it was ruled by the king of kings and also by the judges, for the common good.2 Many kingdoms in priscis temporibus, such as Egypt, Ethiopia, and Arabia, had been similar examples. So was Scotland, and so was England. In England the people could not legislate without the authority of the head, who was a king and possessed the realm in hereditary right, and to whom the people were subject; yet even there the dominion was regulated by the dispensation of many. For the king could not change the law nor impose taxation without the consent of his subjects, and the judges were sworn not to give judgments against the laws even if the king commanded them to do so.3 Finally, even Heaven itself was an example of this dominion, since, indeed, there the consent of all its citizens was not lacking to every judgment of the king.4 Though there were fundamental differences in the domi- nions exercised by the king ruling regally and by the king ruling politically, nevertheless certain affinities between the two were discernible.5 The king reigning tantum regaliter would sometimes in practice find it advisable to rule politi- cally, i.e. with a regimen plurium consilio ministratum, as in the case of the Roman king's consulting the senate.6 Likewise, a king ruling politice would for some purposes find it desirable to act royally, and for other purposes would 'N.L.N., I, ch. xvi. 2 Ibid. 3 De Laud., ch. xiii. 4 N.L.N., I, ch. xxii. 5 Cf.

In the sphere of judicature, for instance, a residuum of cases would be at his will; criminal cases, questions of punishment, and matters of equity would be at his discretion; and when laws were lacking, he, the lord, would provide a substitute.' He would necessarily act royally in the event of military emergency arising from rebellion or invasion.2 But in the sphere of legislation he should neither make law nor introduce foreign law, without the assent of his chief subjects; in this sphere the political king should never act regally. Both kings were equally to be likened to God, and the regal king was not to pride himself on being superior to the political king.3 For the power of each was the same.4 To be sure, the political king could not change the law without assent; but the regal king's freedom from restraint in this respect was no more than a liberty to sin, and that was not power at all.5 For all action sprang from two forces: will and power. Since man ever wished for good, the failure to attain it came not from will but from lack of power or impotence. Therefore, the regal king who sinned by for- saking the natural good of consent to laws could not be deemed more powerful than the king who did not so sin; and on the other hand, the good realised by the latter in obtaining consent to laws must be held to derive not only from his will, but also from his power.6 Nevertheless, though the two kings were equal in power, they certainly differed in the authority they had over their subjects.7 The 1 N.L.N., ch. xxiv. 2 Ibid., ch. xxv. 4 Ibid., ch. xxvi. 3 Ibid., ch. xxii. r Ibid. 6 Ibid.

"</page><page sequence="18">134 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY explanation of this important difference was to be sought in the different origins of the two dominions.' Both types of monarchy, Fortescue thought, originated under natural law. The law of nature was a divine law arising from the very earliest beginnings of human nature; under it and by it the dignitas regia originated and has ever since been ruled.2 All rights of kings (jura regum) were ultimately derived not from the prince's authority, but from the law of nature.3 This law not only established the royal dignity, but also-since there is less virtue in ruling than in creating-governed it.4 Both the ius tantum regale and the ius regale et politicum were subject to natural law.5 Nevertheless, these two sets of kingly rights originated differently. The regal dominion was established by force, but the political and regal dominion by consent,6 and of the two the former was the more ancient. Regal dominion was first set up by unjust men for the sake of ambition, though, indeed, the law of nature none the less worked through them for man's good.' Men impelled by power, greedy of dignity and glory, had subjugated their neighbours by force, had compelled their service, and had obliged them to obey commands which obtained the sanctity of laws. These subjugated peoples in time assented to their yoke, thinking themselves fortunate, by submission to one, to enjoy protection from the injury and violence threatened them by numerous powerful men. The dominator eventu- ally usurped to himself the name of king. Such had been Nimrod, first of all, then Belus, Ninus, and many other pagans; and so originated the kingdoms ruled by a dominium tantum regale.* But at a later stage of civilisation, large communities 1 De Laud., ch. xiii; cf.

At the time of this incorporation and institution, both the king and the people ordained that the kingdom should be ruled by such laws as they all would assent unto." Such a union into a body politic as this could not be made without the elevation of one to rule. For the body politic was similarly constituted as the body natural. Just as the natural body without a head was a mere trunk, so in political life a community could not be incorporated without a head to govern it. Any people, therefore, desiring to erect itself into a kingdom or any other body politic must needs prefer one man into the ruler's place. The creation of the mystical body of the state was like the development of an embryo into a natural body regulated by one head. As in the natural body the beginning of life was in the heart, which transmitted blood to all the members, so in the politic body the beginning was in the intention of the people, which provided for their benefit, and transmitted itself to the head and all the members. As the nerves in the natural body bound both head and members, and were immutable by the head, and could not be denied by it their due sustenance, so in the body politic its law could not be changed by the king, who likewise could not deprive his subjects of their substance against their will. This being the manner in which the regal and political dominion originated, the scope of the royal power in realms thereby governed was obvious. The king was established (erectus est) for the protection of his subjects' laws, bodies, and goods, and his power was authorised by the people for this purpose and for no other (hanc potestatem a populo effluxam ipse habet).2 Authority, or the sanction of power, for the two kings was thus quite different. To the king ruling tantum regaliter right was merely might 3; he had no authority save that conferred by force; his power, Richard Fitzralph would 1 Govern., ch. ii; De Laud., ch. xiii. 2 Ibid. 8 N.L.N., ch. xxvii.</page><page sequence="20">136 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY have said, was in no better category than the mere brute strength of irrational creatures.' But the power of the king ruling politice, though it was no less, was derived from the very union of a community into a body politic; it was authorised by the foundation of society and state; its sanction was conferred by the will of the whole people; it was, Fitzralph would have said, the authority that belongs to rational creatures alone. IV Three main questions arise from this analysis of For- tescue's doctrines. First, from what sources, if any other than practical experience, did he derive his conception of the dominion regal and political ? Secondly, precisely how is his account of the origin of this dominion to be inter- preted ? Thirdly, how far is his attribution of the mixed dominion to England justified by the facts of the fifteenth century ? On our answer to each of these questions depends our estimate of Fortescue's originality as a theorist, his significance in the history of political ideas, and his value as a publicist. A good deal of difficulty has been made out of the fact that Fortescue's citations of St. Thomas Aquinas or his continuator, Ptolemy of Lucca, and of Egidius Romanus as authorities for his doctrine of the regal and political dominion appear to be unwarranted. It seems that if we turn up his references to those works, or even search through their pages, we do not find any statement about such a dominion.2 This discrepancy between Fortescue and his authorities caused Lord Carlingford, the editor of the De Natura in Lord Clermont's collection, to conclude that 1 Richard Fitzralph of Armagh, op. cit., Lib. II, ch. iv. After giving a description of man's original lordship in the world, Richard is asked why he used therein the word " authority " rather than the word " power." Richard replies: " Auctoritas seu ius soli racionali convenit creature; potestas sive facultas irracionabilibus competit ex sua institucione primaria; quoniam iuxta supra posita verba de genese, I, v. 29, 30." 2 Plummer, op. cit., 171 et seq. ; McIlwain, op. cit., 358 et seq.</page><page sequence="21">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION 137 Fortescue " really derived his doctrines from his own liberal sentiments and the happy experience of his own country"; this conclusion Mr. Plummer also embraced.' A first note of scepticism on this point, however, has been sounded by Professor Mcllwain, who puts the pertinent question: Did Fortescue misunderstand his authorities, or have we mis- understood him ?-and who suggests that even though we do not find anything about constitutional monarchy in those works, yet Fortescue may have cited them legitimately, since perhaps he did not mean by dominion regal and political what we mean by constitutional monarchy. For, to say the least, it is improbable that Fortescue cited these authorities again and again unless he supposed they gave some support or other to his doctrines.2 Professor Mcllwain's query undoubtedly indicates one of the errors that has confused the issue in this matter. Whether or not the dominion regal and political can be thought of as constitutional monarchy must be discussed hereinafter; but in either case, we ought not to expect to find a highly modernised interpretation of Fortescue's fifteenth-century doctrine written very plainly in the texts of the thirteenth century. Yet this seems to be what Lord Carlingford, Plummer, and others have been surprised in not finding. Moreover, Fortescue's citations themselves have been regarded with excessive literalness, partly owing to preoccupation with the works subsequent to the De Natura. We have expected to find in his authorities just the same doctrine as his own, though citation is not neces- sarily reproduction. We have not considered that he might have found certain statements in his authorities, and have combined some of them together into a whole differing from any of its parts. Yet this seems to be precisely what in fact he did do; and if the De Natura does not explicitly say so, it comes very near to it. In the sixteenth chapter of that work, which gives his earliest and fullest account 1 Works, ed. Clermont, 360; Plummer, loc. cit. 2 MclIlwain, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="22">138 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY of the classification of dominions, Fortescue did not directly attribute the mixed dominion to St. Thomas. On the con- trary, he stated that, among various kinds of government, St. Thomas commended dominium regale and dominium politicum, and that Egidius Romanus did likewise. But, wrote Fortescue, there was a third kind of dominion not inferior to these in dignity and praiseworthiness, which was called political and regal (sed et tertium esse dominium, non minus his dignitate et laude, quod politicum et regale nomi- natur). We not only learnt of this dominion from experi- ence and histories of the ancients, but we also understood it to be taught by the doctrine of St. Thomas (nedum experientia et veterum historiis edocemur, sed et dicti Sancti Thomev doctrina edoctum esse cognoscimus). The important words in this statement are doctrina edoctum esse; those scholars who think that Fortescue cited St. Thomas unjustly must, presumably, interpret these words to mean " is to be found written literally in the doctrine." But a strict translation of them is surely " is taught in the doctrine." This comparatively vague assertion does not amount to any very precise citation, and seems a not unfair statement of the possibilities of St. Thomas's or Ptolemy's text. For Fortescue merely took what he supposed to be some of the features of St. Thomas's dominium politicum and dominium regale and joined them together, just as he specifically com- bined the two dominions out of Egidius Romanus's treatise. He found in the De Regimine Principum of St. Thomas (and Ptolemy) and in that of Egidius a characterisation of domi- nium politicum as a rule according to laws that have been made not by one man alone, but by the many. Presumably he saw that the principle of this rule could be joined to the principles of dominium regale, without more loss to the latter than the monarch's monopoly of legislative capacity; and that the resulting combination made a fair description of certain polities of which " experientia et veterum historiis edocemur." He thus improved on his authorities simply by combining certain features of their work for his own</page><page sequence="23">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION I39 purposes. But, having their authority for the parts of the whole he had made himself, he seems sometimes to have assumed that he had their authority also for the whole. This assumption-and before it is said to be in- sincere, we ought to know a great deal about mediaeval methods of literary citation-appears in several passages. For instance, in the chapter just mentioned he stated that St. Thomas affirmed that the Israelites were ruled politice et regaliter under God and the judges, whereas the author of the De Regimine merely said they were ruled politice at one time and regaliter at another. In The Governance St. Thomas was represented as having praised dominion political and regal, whereas actually he praised merely the two separate dominions." But The Governance, we should remember, was composed when Fortescue was well over the then decidedly advanced age of seventy years, and old men are often none too precise in their citation of authorities for their cherished doctrines. If we ask why Fortescue made this combination and formulated his mixed dominion, there are clues for an answer. For we note that he placed first among the sources of the theory experience and ancient histories; St. Thomas and the other theorists were placed second. Furthermore, im- mediately after his allusion to what could be learnt from St. Thomas, he passed on to the kingdom of England. " In regno namque Anglix " is the copulative phrase between these topics. These methods of expressing himself point to the conclusion that he wanted a theory to cover the facts of the English polity as he knew them. He saw that the English polity could not be described as either a political or a regal dominion merely. But a combination 1 N.L.N., I, ch. xvi; Govern., ch. i. For the various passages in the De Regimine Principum of St. Thomas and Ptolemy, and of Egidius, see the references and citations given by Plummer, loc. cit. Fortescue's citation of the Compendium Morale Rogeri de Waltham, which he says (Govern., ch. i) " more openly treats " of dominion political and regal than St. Thomas's work, shows that he was content to regard even nebulous allusions as good authority, for Roger's treatment of monarchy is of a merely moral character (see Plummer, op. cit., 175).</page><page sequence="24">140 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY of the two not only substantially provided the desired theoretical category, but also brought in the authority of the great St. Thomas and his successors. He therefore made the combination. Hence we can say that Fortescue found the theoretical explanation of the English polity as he had experienced it, in his own combination of certain features of the dominium politicum and dominium regale which were described in two works, both entitled De Regimine Principum-of which one was by Egidius Romanus, and the other by St. Thomas and a continuator usually deemed to have been Ptolemy of Lucca.' In answering our second question-Precisely how is Fortescue's account of the origin of the political and regal dominion to be interpreted ?-our chief object of attention must be the thirteenth chapter of the De Laudibus. Doubts, indeed, have been raised whether this chapter really does describe the origin of the mixed dominion, but these doubts cannot be upheld. It is true that the text says that the chapter narrates the manner of institution of the political kingdom (institutionis regni politiciformam), and that later on in the text occur the terms " dominium regale et politicum " and " regnum regale et politicum "; and it has therefore been suggested that the regnum politicum therein described is really the dominium politicum, which was not a mixed dominion at all nor equivalent to the dominium or regnum regale et politicum of England and Scotland mentioned at the end of the chapter. But this purely verbal discrepancy is quite insufficient to support this theory. For it is un- deniable that the chapter relates to the establishment not only of a dominion, but also of a kingdom; so that regnum 1 I entirely agree with A. P. D'Entrives when he remarks on the absence of any visible influence on Fortescue's writings of his legal pre- decessors, Glanville and Bracton (San Tommaso d'Aquino e la Costituzione Inglese nell' Opera di Sir John Fortescue, 264, in Atti della Reale Accademia delle Scienze di Torino, LXII, 1927). I am indebted to Mr. H. O. Evennett, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, for calling my attention to and loaning me this suggestive essay. Sig. D'Entreves does not, I think, add substantially to the conclusions arrived at by Plummer in regard to the relation of Fortescue to St. Thomas's texts.</page><page sequence="25">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION 141 politicum is a literal term for the theme of the chapter. There cannot be a kingdom without a king; every regnum is necessarily regale, whether it be also politicum or not. The word regale is always redundant in the phrase " regnum regale et politicum," though it is not redundant in the phrase " dominium regale et politicum " ; and therefore no inference can be drawn from its omission from the phrase in question. Moreover, either the statements towards the end of the chapter which commence " Sic namque regnum Anglie " and " Sic Scotia " are meaningless verbiage, or they mean that the dominion regal and political of England and the kingdom regal and political of Scotland originated as the political kingdom is said to have done in the previous part of the chapter. All three phrases must therefore mean the same kind of dominion, and the chapter must relate to the origin of the mixed dominion, regal and political. It is the interpretation of this chapter that has been responsible for most of the modern constitutionalism that has been attributed to Fortescue. For this description of the origin of the regnum politicum has been understood as an account of the origin of constitutional monarchy, and on the strength of it he has been hailed as the precursor of Sidney and of Locke.' But it is easy to read back into early texts the ideas of a later date, and Fortescue has been a ready prey for constitutional controversialists and liberal sentimentalists. Actually, no theory of constitutional mon- archy * is propounded or implied in Fortescue's account of 1 Lord Carlingford, Works, 361. Lord Carlingford seems to suggest that Hallam also thought of Fortescue in this light, but I do not find the suggestion substantiated. 2 It is undoubtedly essential to maintain a clear distinction between the terms " limited monarchy " and " constitutional monarchy." Plum- mer, and indeed McIlwain also, use these terms as though they were synonymous, and this confusion is most misleading. A limited monarch is one whose power is absolute except in certain spheres delimited by law and custom. A constitutional monarch is limited but not absolute, for his power is controlled by some other co-existent power whose authority he cannot lawfully override. An absolute monarch is not necessarily also despotic, for, though he may be restrained only by custom or by moral and material forces, yet his power need not be arbitrary, as a despot's is.</page><page sequence="26">142 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY the origin of the regnum politicum, or anywhere else in his writings; and if he was the precursor of anyone, it was of Hobbes rather than of Locke. For close attention to Fortescue's own words seems to show indubitably that he completely confused and treated as one phenomenon the origin of political society and the formation of the mon- archical state. In his view, the people, when joining together in political society, necessarily (semper oportet) established at the same time one ruler over them, and this ruler was king. He did not conceive, as Locke did, that the people might agree to unite first, and later, by some further compact, appoint a ruler to rule according to an agreed code of laws. His social contract was also itself the political one. The body politic and the monarchy were created at one and the same time, and by the same act of union. Fortescue's regnum politicum was established in exactly the same manner as Hobbes's Leviathan. There was no room, in Fortescue's view of this establish- ment, for a choice among various forms of government. Once the initial act of incorporation had been performed, all else followed with the same immutability as an embryo developed into a physical organism with one head. The act of incorporation was engendered by the intention of the people to provide for their political welfare, and this pro- vision necessarily involved the maintenance of law; or rather, their political welfare was the maintenance of law by all members. There was thus no question of agreements between people and ruler to do or not to do this or that; there was no question of surrendering, retaining, or con- ferring rights. The act of incorporation and the establish- ment of the monarch were part and parcel of the maintenance of law; there could be none of these without the others, any more than in a physical organism the head, heart, and nerves could live without one another. Nor did it follow that law existed before this incorporation, any more than the nerves existed before the development of the embryo into the physical organism. Without the incorporation of</page><page sequence="27">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION 143 the people and the establishment of the ruler, law could not be maintained; and law unmaintained is not law. But the purpose of law was to protect the people in their lives and goods, and therefore the king, when established, had no power to change the law or to seize the property of the people. King and law were bound up together; no king, no law--no law, no king. Hence if the law were to be altered, or the goods of the people confiscated by taxation, their assent had to be obtained. For the only power the king had was from them, and he had it for the maintenance of law. But he did have this power, and he had it absolutely. Once given, it could not be taken away without the dissolu- tion of the body politic; there was no control over it, no system of checks or balances upon it; for the purposes of his establishment the king was an absolute monarch. He was limited only by the necessity of procuring the assent of the people for an alteration in their legal and proprietary status. He was not, in short, a constitutional monarch; for he was uncontrolled, and there were no means of restrain- ing him or of disposing of him. He was an absolute autocrat in his own proper sphere.' Yet he was not above the law, for it was law that made him ruler, just as the head of the physical organism was not above the biological law that made it. The maintenance of the laws and property of the people was his very raison d''tre, and the exercise of his power was thus limited by the need for the assent of the people, from whom his power originally came.2 Fortescue's theory of regal and political dominion is thus in no sense a theory of constitutional monarchy. It is essentially a theory in line with the typical mediaeval theory 1 Jovian Hicks, in his Passive Obedience Defended (I683), noted this point. 2 Waterhous, in his Commentaries on the De Laudibus (1663), observed (p. 200) that the phrase " potestatem a populo effluxam ipse habet " is not to be understood as applying to the government of England, " which is an Imperial Crown, and is not alloyed by the politique admissions into it, but that that, as to the integrals and essentials of regality, retains its in- dependency." Such phrases he held to relate to the " first ages of the world."</page><page sequence="28">144 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY of the kingship that was not tyranny, of the king ruling according to law. It is impossible to find in it any important innovation in the theory of kingship, except the vivid explanation of its origin. This explanation was obviously suggested, with perhaps some help from Vincent of Beau- vais,' by the two passages which Fortescue quoted from St. Augustine and Aristotle respectively. St. Augustine said that a people is a body of men associated together by a consent of law and a community of interest; Aristotle affirmed that when a multitude is reduced to a unity, one will rule and the others be ruled. Fortescue again exercised his talents for combining theories, and produced his account of the origin of limited monarchy. If his premises be granted, his theory is not an unreasonable one. But no more striking evidence of his conservatism can be mentioned than the very restricted conclusion he drew from his theory. If he had been a constitutionalist it would have been easy for him to deduce a whole system of checked, balanced, responsible, and controlled monarchy from a few modifications of his account of origins. But he did not do so, for to him the king was absolute, even though limited. It never occurred to him that the king was accountable to any less remote author- ity than that of the divine wrath.2 The people had established the monarch, but this act exhausted their initiative. They had established, for their own good, a master who was to be obeyed, unless, indeed, he altered the law or seized their goods without their assent. But even if he did these things without their assent, they had no remedy against him unless they could overpower him. The king's council was not a 1 Plummer suggests (op. cit., 84) that the account of the origin of the two forms of government was derived from Vincent of Beauvais, De Morali Principis Institutione. But he hardly brings any evidence to the support of this suggestion (ibid., notes to ch. ii). He merely quotes a passage from that work bearing on Nimrod and Ninus, which is, of course, quite irrelevant to the theory of origins; and, in any case, Fortescue cites St. Augustine for his authority on those two monarchs. The present writer has not examined the De Morali, a copy of which, known to have belonged to Fortescue, is now in the Bodleian (Rawl., c. 398). 2 N.L.N., I, ch. xxvii.</page><page sequence="29">SIR JOHN FORTESCUE AND HIS THEORY OF DOMINION 145 check upon, but an instrument of, the royal power, and Fortescue thought it should be made more efficient. The third and last of our questions-How far was Fortescue's attribution of the mixed dominion to England justified ?-involves a preliminary determination of precisely what the attribution implied. This determination is easy, for Fortescue's specific references to the polity of England were few, definite, and unambiguous. The kingdom of England was a dominion regal and political, and the king of England's authority was that of a king ruling politically. For the kingdom had been founded by the community that had come long ago from Italy and Greece with Brutus; this community had willed to unite and form a body politic called a realm, and had chosen Brutus to be its head and king. They and he, at the time of this incorporation and institution, had ordained the realm to be ruled and " justi- fied " by such laws as they all would assent to. The " law " of England was therefore political because it was made by the counsel of many, and it was also regal because it was administered by a king.2 Hence it came about that in Fortescue's time the king and his ministers could not, or at least did not, change the laws or impose taxes on his subjects, without their assent. This assent he particularised in one place as that of the Three Estates, and in another as being expressed in parliament. Furthermore, in England, he said, the judges were sworn to render judgment according to the laws, even if the prince commanded them to the contrary.3 1 Govern., chs. xv, xvi. 2 De Laud., ch. xiii; Govern., ch. ii. Fortescue seems to have had a certain amount of authority for his version of Brutus's elevation, at any rate in so far as the legend tells of his being chosen as leader of the Trojans. Thus in the Nova Chronica of Rede, a copy of which is known to have been in Fortescue's possession, it is said (p. 185) that Brutus was elected leader before the migration from Greece. Geoffrey of Monmouth's own version is to the effect that the Trojans besought Brutus to be their " dux," and to free them from their servitude to the Greeks. He used the same words as Fortescue did to describe this elevation, i.e. erectum est (Historia Regum Brittanie, ed. A. Griscom, 1929, P. 225). 3 The texts for these statements are to be found in N.L.N., I, ch. xvi; De Laud., chs. ix, xviii, xxxvi. TRANS. 4TH S.-VOL. XVII. L</page><page sequence="30">146 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY Apart from the statement of the historical origins-and even that is not without foundation in the then received Brutus legend-it ought not to be necessary to argue that Fortescue's very brief and matter-of-fact description of the monarchy of his day is a just one. But it has been said in a well-known work on the evolution of parliament that " the constitutional ideal which Sir John Fortescue depicted at the close of the middle ages had little more relevance to the practice of his day than More's Utopia had to the government of Cardinal Wolsey." 1 These words are pictur- esque, and create a vivid impression of Fortescue's work; but, unfortunately, they give a totally wrong impression of it. For if Fortescue depicted an ideal at all, it was not constitutional; and if he depicted anything constitutional, it was not ideal. It is true that he depicted in one passage a more or less Utopian ideal for England-a state in which " this (England) shal be a collage, in whiche shul syng and pray for evermore al the men of Ingland spirituel and temporel " 2-but this ideal was based merely upon certain administrative reforms tending to strengthen the executive, and had nothing whatever to do with constitutional matters. He contemplated no sort of constitutional reforms or ideals. His remarks on what we call the constitution are in no sense Utopian-they simply reflect the facts; so far from being irrelevant to the practice of his day, they state it. For there can be no serious doubt that the normal practice of the king in the fifteenth century was neither to alter the law of the land nor to impose taxes without the assent of parliament. Even the theory that his practice might be different was mentioned only to be refuted. The rebels of 1450, for instance, alleged that there were some people who said the king was above law and might break it as he 1 A. F.

As the German translator of The Governance says: " Was Fortescue in der 'Regierung Englands' schreibt, ist der Niederschlag der Erfahrungen, die er unter den Lancasters gemacht " (Cber die Regierung Englands, ubers. u. hsgb. v.

But the contrary, they insisted, was the truth; otherwise the king would not swear at his coronation to keep the laws, nor would he ever need to summon parliament to ask the commons for their money.1 Moreover, King Henry IV himself informed the Pope that statutes could not be revoked or changed without the assent of the estates 2; and the lords of parliament affirmed in the minority of Henry VI that the law of the land could not have been altered by the late king without the same assent.3 The king of England, Philip de Commynes noticed, took a long time to raise money, for he could not do it without the assent of parliament.4 Practice and theory in these constitutional matters thus coincided. Fortescue, in stating them, was but voicing the common opinion and describing the ordinary fact of his time. His originality lay not in any exceptional constitutional enlightenment nor in liberal sentiments, but in his attempt to array bare constitutional facts in the imposing raiment of political theory. 1 Articles of Kent, in Magdalen College, Oxford, MSS., printed in Hist.
