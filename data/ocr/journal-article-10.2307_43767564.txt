<plain_text><page sequence="1">NICOLAS COLDSTREAM AND THE AEGEAN BRONZE AGE PETER WARREN Friendships do not usually spring forth fully formed like Athena from the head of Zeus. It is therefore not easy to recall the beginning of more than thirty years of warm enjoyment and stimulus every time one finds oneself in Nicolas and Nicky Coldstream's company. My two earliest memories are not quite such as to have guaranteed a long friendship. A first sighting of the commanding presence of Nicolas, George Huxley and Dick Hope Simpson conversing together in the Finlay Library of the British School at Athens was rather awesome to a naive postgraduate. Soon afterwards, as apotheke assistant to Sinclair Hood on his final Royal Road season at Knossos in 1961, 1 was put to work by Nicolas, to draw a quite richly decorated, yet fragmentary Early Protogeometric bell-krater. Having no such previous technical experience I certainly needed his basic instruction on measuring off from an upright set-square and getting the result to look correct on millimetre paper. Calm and kindness marked the instructions; the same qualities, allied to laughter and efficiency, have always ensured delight in his friendship. 'Nineteen zembils before breakfast',1 said with modest pride and a smile, would inspire one through duller groups of sherds on a hot summer's day at Knossos. Inspiration with a twinkle comes in other forms too. After watching him play difficult Chopin Etudes, my ten-year old daughter rushed to the kitchen and announced, 4 He has played all those right through without music'. The world of scholarship knows that the majority of Nicolas Coldstream's major contributions are to knowledge of early Greek, Cretan and Cypriot art, archaeology and iconography. The result of these many contributions is a more profound understanding of the human achievement, expressed in the Hellenic culture of these regions in the centuries following those of the Bronze Age kingdoms. Yet there is also present in these publications a dimension additional to the purely Hellenic: in them he has brought to bear an extensive knowledge of the preceding Aegean Bronze Age. Thus at Knossos his publications of tombs and his paper on settlement and cemetery analysis, 'Dorian Knossos and Aristotle's Villages',2 have enlightened knowledge of the early stages of transformation from Minoan to Hellenic culture at the Cretan capital. His hypothesis of polis formation here, not from coalescence of villages but from a single main Dorian centre established in Sub-Minoan times, will stimulate further research and excavation. Again, in his studies of divinities, 'Deities in Aegean Art',3 and 'A Proto- geometric Nature Goddess from Knossos',4 knowledge of the anthropomorphic objects of Bronze Age worship illuminates understanding of their successor divinities in the Greek Iron Age. 1 Laying out, studying and recording (nineteen) baskets of sherds. To reassure current and later generations I should add that the baskets were the old plaited ones and breakfast was the mid-morning kolatsó. 2 In Aux origines de V hellénisme: la Crète et la Grèce.

COLDSTREAM At the same time Nicolas Coldstream's contributions to Bronze Age scholarship itself have been highly significant too. His work on Kythera, with G.L. Huxley, R. Hope Simpson and other colleagues, remains seminal for students of Minoan and Helladic interconnections in the Late Bronze Age.5 His publication in the Kythera volume of the pottery from the settlement at Kastri remains one of the most detailed catalogues, discussions and illustrations of Late Bronze Age material from any Aegean site, and is a constant source of reference. One detail of this work, the typology of Vapheio cups based on the Kytherean stratigraphy, has recently proved critical for more precise definition of the destruction date of Akrotiri on Thera in terms of the Minoan and Helladic ceramic sequences. It is a true pleasure to be associated with the enterprise of his students in bringing out their homage to his discoveries and his ideas, and in particular with all those students of the Aegean Bronze Age whose research Nicolas Coldstream has supervised and stimulated. 5 J.N.
