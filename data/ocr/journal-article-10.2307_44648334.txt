Kroell Biomedical Science Department GM Research Laboratories Warren, Ml Frank D. Raasch Department of Pathology University of California San Diego, CA OVERVIEW Field studies have found that belt restraint systems are effective in reducing injury in lateral collisions (1-5)*, in part due to reduc- tion of occupant ejection. For an occupant on the impacted side (near side) of the vehicle, there is little space for lateral displacement before contact with the side (interior) of the vehicle. However, for occupants more removed from the impact side of the vehicle, such as a far side or center occupant, there is in general appreciable lateral space available for dis- placement of the body. In this case, a belt restraint system might be effective in resisting lateral displacement. This study is a preliminary investigation of belt restraint performance in lateral impacts where significant space for lateral displacement is available.

These subjects were restrained by a three-point belt configuration, the diagonal upper strap having either an outboard or inboard anchor, or by a lap belt only (see Fig. 1) . The purpose of these experiments was to investigate the mechanics of lateral impact restraint by these different belt configura- tions, (i.e., magnitude of restraining forces, body regions loaded, and occupant kinematics). **The experimental use of these subjects compli- ed with guidelines established by the U.S. Public Health Service and recommended by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council. ABSTRACT Far-side lateral impacts were simulated using a Part 572 dummy and human cadavers to compare responses for several belt restraint configurations. Sled tests were conducted having a velocity change of 35 km/hr at a 10 g deceleration level. It was estimated from field data that a 35 km/hr velocity change of the laterally struck vehicle represents about an 80th percentile level for injury-producing lateral collisions. Subjects restrained by a three-point belt system with an outboard anchored diagonal shoul- der belt (i.e., positioned over the shoulder opposite the side of impact) rotated out of the shoulder belt and onto the seat. The subject received some lateral restraint due to inter- action with the shoulder belt and seatback. The subjects restrained by a three-point belt system with an inboard anchored diagonal shoulder belt (i.e., positioned over the shoulder on the side of impact) remained essentially upright due to shoulder belt interaction with the neck and/or head. Kinematic responses of the Part 572 dummy were generally similar to those of the cadaver subjects. Injuries were found in cadavers restrained by both shoulder belt configurations, but were more extensive to the cervical region for those subjects receiving direct neck and/or head loading from the belt. However, limitations in the cadaver model and test environment, as well as the preliminary nature of the experiments do not permit definitive conclusions on the signifi- cance or applicability of the injury data ob- tained to real accident situations at this time. 3338 0096-736X/80/8804-3338$02.50 Copyright Â© 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">In the laboratory experiments, a simple open test fixture was mounted to the sled structure. It consisted of an automotive bench seat and a flat footrest with a simulated tunnel so that only a limited number of structures other than the belt restraint were available to interact with a single occupant surrogate during the deceleration exposure. According to reported field studies (1-9), lateral collisions represent a wide range of impact conditions. However, this preliminary investigation was restricted to a single impact angle (90 from frontal) and impact velocity (35 km/hr) . The lateral impact simulated in this study is representative of a severe impact where a restraint system might provide significant occupant protection. Investigation of other impact conditions is necessary to apply the results of this study to the general spectrum of side impact field accidents. Unembalmed and embalmed human cadavers were tested to provide a range of pretest musculo- skeletal condition and impact response. The embalmed subjects were not "limbered" prior to testing except for that necessary to allow positioning in the fixture. Necropsies were performed on the cadaver subjects. Lateral impact experiments, conducted at lower velocity changes, have been reported with human volunteer subjects restrained by four- point parallel torso and lap straps by Zaborowski (18) and Ewing et al (19 and 20) . The well controlled and instrumented exposures reported by Ewing et al provided additional lateral restraint to the torso by a lightly padded board. Although these studies involve substan- tially different experimental methodologies than the present study, precluding a direct comparison of the two, they do provide voluntary response data on the tonic human neck subjected to sub- injury lateral inert ial loading by the head. METHODOLOGY TEST ENVIRONMENT - The test fixture (Fig. 1) consisted of an automotive front bench seat, fixed anchor supports for the belts, a flat floor pan with a rectangular-sectioned simulated tunnel, and a lateral support on the side of the seat opposite the impact to maintain the surro- gate's initial position prior to sled decelera- tion. These components were mounted on the sled such that the acceleration vector was lateral with respect to the seat, fixture, and occupant. The "open" fixture provided good visibility for high speed photography permitting three dimen- sional analysis of the belt interaction with the occupant. A bench seat for a full sized (four door) 1978 passenger car was used to minimize potential lateral restraint by the seat (as compared to a contoured bucket seat) and to provide a somewhat continuous lateral surface. The subject was initially positioned on the far side of the seat (opposite the impacted side of the sled) , so that the impact tended to move the subject towards the impact side of the seat (see Fig. 1). The subjects were positioned in a Fig. 1 - Test fixture mounted on the GMR crash simulator showing the bench seat, flat floor with tunnel, and lateral acceleration support. The Part 572 dummy subject is restrained by a lap belt. Approximate shoulder belt anchor locations are indicated conventional seated attitude, and were placed against the lateral acceleration support which prevented the head, thorax and thigh from moving prior to sled deceleration. A three-point belt configuration having a diagonal shoulder strap was used for all tests except experiments 1137 and 1151 for which only a lap belt was used. The three point configura- tions were formed by a separate belt segment from each of the two floor anchors and a shoulder belt anchor, the three segments being attached together at a point laterally in line with the subject's hip joint on the side opposite from the shoulder belt anchor. All tests used the same floor anchor locations, which were chosen to be compatible with the seat. However, various shoulder belt anchor locations were used. These locations consisted of (see Fig. 1) : Outboard (Opposite impact side) - Simulated typical in-vehicle location for the seat. Inboard (Impact side) - Seat top height ("low") location (not attached to the seat) ; Roof height ("high") location. Polyester automotive belt webbing was used, being attached to the anchorage hardware such that slip or "payout" of webbing did not occur. The belts were subjectively adjusted "snug" such that they were not under significant tension nor did they have free slack. Belt tension trans- ducers were located at or near. the belt anchors for all tests. IMPACT CONDITIONS - Tests were conducted at nominal sled conditions of: a velocity change of 35 km/hr, a constant 10 g deceleration level, and a deceleration pulse duration of 110 ms. Sled deceleration response is shown in Figs. 3 to 12 for typical tests. 3339</page><page sequence="3">3340 J. D. HORSCH, ET AL. A velocity change of 35 km/hr was chosen to simulate a severe lateral impact and is compared to field data reported by Hartemann et al (1) in Fig. 2. Their reported estimate of the velocity change of the laterally struck vehicle for 296 lateral impacts involving an injured occupant is plotted in Fig. 2 as a cumulative percentage. A velocity change of 35 km/hr (for the laterally struck vehicle) represents about an 83 percentile severity level compared to their car to car data and about a 59 percentile severity level compared to their car to fixed object data (about 20% of the sample) . SUBJECT PREPARATION - The Part 572 dummy was adjusted with a nominal "1 g" adjustment of the knee, hip, shoulder, and elbow joints. The arm and leg twist joints were tight. Typical head and thorax triaxial accelerometers were installed to monitor response dynamics. All tests using cadaver subjects were conducted at -the University of California at San Diego Medical School. These cadaver subjects were stored at 3 C until approximately six hours prior to the test. Unembalmed subjects were allowed to pass through the characteristic stages of rigor mortis, and therefore an essen- tially flaccid state was realized for all tests. The pre- test preparation for the two embalmed subjects required manipulation of the extremity joints to permit maintenance of the desired seating attitude. However, the head/neck region was not flexed, and the tissue stiffness induced by the preservative chemicals was suffi- cient to maintain an upright head position. Care was exercised in pre-test handling of the subjects to prevent abnormal loads or displace- ments on individual body segments. Table 1 contains descriptive information for the cadaver subjects. POST TEST NECROPSY - The post test necropsy procedure for the cadaver subjects included dissection and examination of the anterior thoracic wall, contents of the thorax and abdo- men, cervical spine, thoracic and lumbar spine, and pelvic structure, though all areas were not examined for every test specimen (see Table 1) . Traditional postmortem examination techniques were employed in the thoracico-abdominal and pelvic dissections. Examination of the cervical spine followed portions of the procedure recom- mended by Noguchi et al (21) . A superior- inferior incision was made along the mid-line of the neck and the overlying tissues reflected to expose the anterior neck organs. After inspec- tion, the structures were reflected and the anterior portion of the vertebral column was examined. The subject was then placed in a prone position and a similar approach was utilized to expose the posterior aspect of the cervical spine. The neural arches were removed and the underlying dura examined. Opening of the dura permitted access to the spinal cord. For some subjects (see Table 1) , an additional procedure was used. The cervical spine was removed CKl btoc from C-l to C-7 and sawn in the midsagittal plane to permit viewing of the cross sections of the intervertebral discs.

Control cadaver subjects were necropsied as part of the procedure. These control subjects received the same pre-test protocol as exposed specimens except that they were not placed on the sled fixture. The investigating pathologist performed the necropsy without being aware that these specimens had not received an acceleration exposure. RESULTS/DISCUSSION Test results are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Tests are grouped into those having similar belt configurations. Belt configurations differed only in the shoulder belt anchor location (or lack of shoulder belt) and are specified accord- ing to this location. The approximate shoulder belt locations are indicated in Fig. 1 and can be seen in sequence photos for selected tests in Figs. 3 to 12. Tests with the high inboard shoulder belt anchor were not entirely similar due to variations of subject size, seated posture and the fore-aft location of the anchor. In addition to the sequence photos which show surrogate kinematics, the corresponding transduc- er responses are also shown in Figs. 3 to 12. Peak belt forces are listed in Table 2 for each of the belt segments. A peak resultant belt force acting on the upper body was estimated by film analysis of occupant-belt kinematics and measured shoulder belt tension. This estimate was made by measuring the directions of the shoulder belt from body contact (i.e., the two tangent points on the upper body) and computing a resultant force vector. However, assigning the measured upper shoulder belt tension to both</page><page sequence="4">BELT RESTRAINED SUBJECTS 334 1 Table 1 DESCRIPTION OF CADAVER SUBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF NECROPSY FINDINGS Shoulder Test Ag* _[Year) of SUMMARY OF NECROPSY FINDINGS Anchor - We19ht (k9) - Thoracic, Neck Location1 Subj.2 u "I (cm) , x Comments Pelvis Abdomen Thorax Lumbar u Height (cm) , x Spines Skeletal Ligamentous Cord/Other 048 Cardi o-resplratory 3 3 3 Separation disc C5-6 complete- 4 Torn post. long.

FF - Unembalmed female not done. belt segments introduces some uncertainty in this calculation, since the actual tension in the lower end of the shoulder belt was not determined. Responses of head HIC index and 3 ms g level and thorax GSI and 3 ms g level, all based upon triaxial linear acceleration, are given in Table 2 for the Part 572 dummy when measured. COMPARISON OF KINEMATICS FOR VARIOUS RESTRAINT CONFIGURATIONS - Subjects having an outboard anchored shoulder belt (the belted shoulder opposite the impact side), Figs. 3 and 4, exhibited significantly different kinematics than did subjects having an inboard anchored shoulder belt (the belted shoulder on the impact side), Figs. 6 to 12. Dummy and cadaver subjects restrained by the outboard shoulder belt moved laterally out of the shoulder belt and rotated about the pelvis onto the seat. This response is contrasted to that of the dummy and cadaver subjects restrained by the inboard shoulder belt. These subjects moved laterally into the belt, which held the subject somewhat upright because the shoulder belt applied a lateral restraining force primarily to the subject's neck and/or head. As might be expected, this upper torso restraint for the subjects having the inboard shoulder belt significantly reduced the lateral displacement of the upper body as compared to subjects having the outboard shoulder belt. Reduced lateral displacement could be a positive aspect of the shoulder belt on the impact side since the most frequently injured body region is reported to be the head (3,6) for conventionally belt-restrained occupants in far side lateral impacts. However, the direct loading of the neck may represent a significant challenge with undetermined consequences to this body region. Comparison of Part 572 dummy responses for the lap belt only restraint configurations, Fig. 5, with the outboard shoulder belt restraint, Fig. 4, indicates similar kinematics. The dummy moves laterally and rotates about the pelvis onto the seat. Interestingly, a comparison of the responses indicates that the shoulder belt provides some lateral restraint. This is demonstrated by reduced head and thorax result- ant accelerations, by a lower peak outboard lap belt tension, and by a reduction of lateral upper body displacement for the three point belt restraint as compared to the lap belt only restraint.</page><page sequence="5">3342 J.

D. HORSCH, ET AL. Head acceleration exhibits a "spike" when the head impacts the arm for dummy tests 1135, 1137, and 1151, which is particularly large for the lap belt only tests (1137 and 1151) . Re- sponse histories are shown in Fig. 5 for test 1151. The large acceleration "spike", due to the head-arm impact, is presumed to be an arti- fact caused by the heavy, rigid metal skeleton of the Part 572 dummy and thus accentuates the actual differences of head acceleration response resulting from the two restraint configurations. Some of the restraint provided by the outboard shoulder belt is due to friction as the upper body slides between the belt and seat back. Additional lateral restraint is developed by the subject's elbow catching the shoulder belt (see 100 and 130 ms photos, Figs. 3 and 4). The lateral displacement of the upper body is 11 cm less for the dummy restrained by the outboard shoulder belt than for the lap belt only. This can be seen by comparing tests 1152 and 1151, Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. The restraint provided by the outboard shoulder belt is probably sensitive to the level of belt slack/ tension and to the impact angle. It is conceiv- able that at some frontal impact angle the upper body would not slide out from under the belt restraint and thereby be predominantly restrain- ed by the belt system. Adomit et al (22) reported that at an impact angle of 58 , the subject escaped the shoulder belt in laboratory experiments but at more frontal impacts the subject remained restrained by the shoulder belt. All subjects restrained by the inboard shoulder belt for the test conditions studied exhibited significantly reduced lateral dis- placement of the upper body. This was due to direct belt loading of the neck/head. However, the region loaded and the head/neck kinematics were strongly dependent upon the relative posi- tion of the belt along side the head/neck. For these tests, the relative position of the belt with respect to the head/neck was a function of anchor height, anchor fore-aft position, and subject seated height and posture. Fig. 13 shows the lateral alignment of the belt to the subject's head for various setup configurations. These alignments, as shown in Fig. 13, are discussed below: 1. A low anchor location was used for tests 1065, 047 (Fig. 6), 048, 051 (Fig. 7), 052 (Fig. 8), and 056. This placed the shoulder belt along the base of the neck for all subjects. For these tests, the head rotated about the belt toward the impact side as demonstrated in Figs. 6, 7, and 8. 2. A high anchor location was used for test 049 (Fig. 12) . The belt loaded the neck at a higher location than for the low anchor, but did not contact the side of the head due to a forward head position. The head also rotated about the belt toward the impact side as demon- strated in Fig. 12. 3. A high (more rearward) anchor location was used for tests 1138 and 1150 (Fig. 9). The belt loaded the side of the head holding the head somewhat upright through the exposure as demonstrated in Fig. 9. 4. A high anchor location was used for tests 1063, 046 (Fig. 10), and 053 (Fig. 11). The belt loaded the head more toward the front than the other test configurations. The head eventually rotated from under the belt as demon- strated in Figs. 10 and 11. Some comparisons of response are made for subjects restrained by a low positioned anchor on the inboard (impact) side. The sequence photographs for the Part 572 dummy (test 047, Fig. 6), an unembalmed cadaver (test 051, Fig. 7), and an embalmed cadaver (test 052, Fig. 8) indicate a significant difference in head/neck rebound motion. The unembalmed cadaver's head (Fig. 7) rotated over the belt and remained near the belted shoulder. The embalmed cadaver's head (Fig. 8) rotated over the belt in a fashion similar to the unembalmed cadaver, but the head rebounded to an upright posture, remaining in this upright posture. This indicates signifi- cant restoring forces, presumably due to the tissue stiffness induced by applied chemical preservation. The Part 572 dummy's head (Fig. 6) rotated over the belt similar to that of the cadaver subjects, then rebounded back beyond the original upright position. The subject for test 056 was in some re- spects different from the other exposed cadavers - age, weight, height, injury, and peak belt loads. A plot of estimated peak neck loading by the shoulder belt vs. subject weight is shown in Fig. 14 for subjects restrained by a low inboard anchored shoulder belt. This plot suggests that the lower estimated peak neck loading for the 23 year old cadaver subject of test 056 was primar- ily due to a significantly lower subject mass than for the other subjects tested with the low inboard shoulder belt anchor. NECROPSY FINDINGS - Although the human cadaver model has been reported to be more vulnerable to impact injury than living humans (10-15) , a detailed examination for injuries was conducted to identify acute trauma, which might assist in identifying potential mechanisms of injury associated with lateral deceleration forces. It should be noted that not all speci- mens were examined to the same extent (see Table 1). The neck region, however, was thoroughly examined in all cases due to characteristics of the deceleration forces. Fracture of the pelvis was found in three of the six subjects examined. These fractures are thought to be due to loading by the lap belt. No abdominal injuries were found for the five subjects examined. Fractures of the ribs and/or sternum were found for four of the seven subjects examined. However, two of these subjects (057 and 059) had received CPR prior to death and this was quite possibly the cause of some or all of the musculo- skeletal injury in these two cases. For another subject (054), the examiner noted that the bones were very brittle and easily broken. Observed neck injuries were confined to the cervical spine and related ligamentous structures</page><page sequence="16">BELT RESTRAINED SUBJECTS 3353 and not to the overlying soft tissues of the cervical region. Greater cervical damage was found in subjects receiving a direct neck/head loading by the inboard (impact side) upper torso belt than in subjects restrained by the outboard (opposite impact side) shoulder belt. Interest- ingly, the only cadaver subject (056) in which no injury was found received direct neck loading by the shoulder belt. However, he was signifi- cantly younger (23 vs. 56 years for the next youngest subject), of lighter weight, and smaller stature than the other exposed subjects. The peak neck loading by the shoulder belt of 3.8 kN was significantly less than that for the other cadaver subjects restrained in a similar manner (5.9 kN, 6.5 kN, and 7.8 kN) . INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DAMAGE WITH OUTBOARD- ANCHORED SYSTEM - Some discussion is required concerning the observation of intra-discal clefts or fissures in midsagittal sections of the cervical spine for the four subjects tested with the outboard anchored shoulder belt, as listed in Table 1. A subjective appraisal based upon the high speed films of these tests is one of rather innocuous kinematics - a smooth roll- out from under the shoulder belt, with little relative angular displacement between head and torso. Each of the specimens so tested, however, revealed the intra-discal clefts at necropsy (Fig. 15A) . Subsequently, two untested control specimens were dissected, and very similar findings were detected in both cases (Fig. 15B) . It is thus possible that these discal clefts observed in the subjects restrained by the outboard-anchored system were pre-existing defects caused by advanced age (a supporting discussion is given in Appendix I). INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS - The simplified test environment used in this preliminary study clearly has limitations in simulating actual lateral collisions, and the Part 572 dummy and human cadaver surrogates have limitations in representing car occupants.

Previous investigators who compared injuries of belt-restrained human cadavers in laboratory tests with field accident data (10-15) concluded that injuries to cadaver subjects were excessive. The cervical spine was one of the body regions injured. It is likewise believed that the injuries observed in the cadaver tests in this study are also excessive when compared to the injury risk for similarly exposed car occupants and should not be automatically applied to represent that of car occupants. In spite of these acknowledged limitations, the comparative interaction of the surrogate and restraint is believed to have been adequately simulated in terms of basic kinematics and load distribution to the body for the specific test conditions investigated. The generally similar kinematics of the Part 572 dummy, embalmed cadaver, and unembalmed cadaver surrogates strengthens this conclusion. The results have shown that an outboard shoulder belt provides measurable restraint to the upper body in a far-side lateral impact. It is speculated that this restraint will increase as the impact becomes more frontal (22) or decrease with additional belt slack. The results have also demonstrated that an inboard shoulder belt significantly reduces lateral displacements of the upper body in far side lateral impact, which could be a positive aspect; however, the restraining load is applied primarily to the neck and/or head region. It may be speculated that if the restraining force could be shifted from the neck/ head region to the thorax, this would reduce the challenge to the cervical region and, at the same time, provide protection against head injury from impact with the vehicle far side interior, the adjacently seated occupants, or other objects. SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS 1. All belt systems investigated in this study provided lateral restraining forces in the experimental far side lateral impact simulation. However, the magnitude of the forces, the body regions exposed to belt loading, and the surro- gate kinematics were significantly dependent upon the specific restraint configuration. 2. The lap portion of the belt systems provided lateral restraining forces on the pelvis for all belt configurations tested. However, the restraint of the upper torso was highly dependent upon the location of the shoulder belt relative to the side of impact. a. For the belted shoulder on the side of impact (inboard anchored), the shoulder belt substantially reduced lateral motion of the upper torso by directly loading the neck and/or head. The height of the shoulder belt anchor significantly affected the specific area of the neck/head loading and, therefore, the head /neck kinematics. b. For the belted shoulder opposite the side of impact (outboard anchored) , the upper torso moved laterally between the shoulder belt and seat and rotated onto the adjacent seat structure. Some lateral upper torso restraint occurred by inter- action with the shoulder belt and seat back as compared to no upper torso restraint for a lap belt only configuration. 3. The general surrogate kinematics were similar for the Part 572 dummy and both human cadaver preparations (unembalmed and embalmed) for similar test conditions. 4. Injuries were found in the cadaver subjects restrained by all shoulder belt config- urations. The cervical region was more exten- sively damaged for those cadavers restrained by the shoulder belt anchored on the impact (in- board anchored) side. 5. It must be emphasized that the experi- mental test environment and surrogate models used in this study have significant inherent limitations in terms of simulating field accident conditions. However, it is believed that the basic restraint kinematic principles involving the interaction of occupant and belt restraint system provide basic response information for preliminary assessments of lateral collisions under field situations if the underlying quali- fications are considered. The real life signifi- cance of the reported injury findings cannot be directly evaluated at this time. It is believed that the observed injury to the cadaver test subjects is excessive compared to an injury potential for similarly exposed car occupants. REFERENCES (1) F.

APPENDIX I DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF AGE ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE INTERVERTEBRAL DISC - The intervertebral disc is a unique, highly complex anatomical structure which changes considerably with age. According to Walmsley (23), "...it undergoes more obvious structural change during pre- and post-natal life than any other joint in the body. At birth the outer portion, or annulus fibrosis, and inner portion, or nucleus pulposus, are structurally very distinct, the former being a highly intricate, although organized, network of distinct collagen fibers and f ibrocartilage and the latter a mucoid, or gelatinous, mass containing scattered cartilage cells. As described by Peacock (24) , structural changes occur with age in both regions, but particularly in the nucleus, where, by the second decade of life, a f ibrocartilage network has begun to develop within the gelatinous substance, leading to a firmer consistency. As aging continues, dessication occurs, and the f ibrocartilage mesh increases in density. The compositional and structural differences between nucleus and annulus become less distinct, and macroscopic discrimination becomes difficult by the seventh decade. Fiber degeneration eventually occurs, leading to the formation of fissures, or clefts, within the body of the disc. This is apparently characteristic of advancing age, but cases of gross cleft formation have been reported in cervical specimens repre- senting the third decade of life (20-24 years) . One theory for explaining early cleft formation in the cervical discs is that this is a response to functional mobility demands upon the cervical column. In any event, the foregoing structural changes, extensive as they may be, have been reported as characteristic of otherwise normal but aging tissue. Pathological changes, such as hemorrhage and pigmentation are also reported to occur with increasing frequency in aging discs. Hirsch and Schajowicz (25) have likewise reported structural anomalies of intervertebral discs. In a study of 120 lumbar spine autopsy specimens representing nine decades of life, they found "concentric cracks or cavities" between the lamellae of the annulus fibrosis. These were observed in specimens as young as fifteen years and with increasing frequency in older subjects. Such defects were regarded as "physiological phenomena", generally without clinical significance. On the other hand, particularly in the 40-50 year age group, numer- ous instances of "radiating ruptures" in the annulus were observed; and the authors offer support for a relationship between such defects and the clinical picture of lumbago, or low back pain. A relatively high incidence of intra-discal structural defects, especially with increasing age, is thus well documented in the literature.</page><page sequence="20">BELT RESTRAINED SUBJECTS 3357 This, together with the finding of similar defects in our untested controls and the absence of other overt cervical damage in 3 of the 4 subjects restrained by the outboard anchored shoulder belt, provides the basis for assuming that the lesions found by sectioning of the spine in these subjects may have been pre- existing and not, in fact, produced by the test exposure.</page></plain_text>
