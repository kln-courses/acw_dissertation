<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS IN SUNNITE ISLAM 1 The primary doctrine of consensus (ijma') in Sunnite Islam is simply this: that the unanimous opinion of the Sunnite community in any generation on a religious matter constitutes an authority (hujja), and ought to be accepted by all Muslims in later times. The importance of the doctrine in theory and practice was recognized particularly in medieval Islam, and has been much emphasized, and in some respects exaggerated, by modern orientalists since the studies of Snouck Hurgronje (see ? 17). This being so, it was natural that serious thought should be given to the fundamental question, What is the basis on which this authority of consensus rests? Or, what facts about Islam and the world legitimize it? This is the question known in Arabic as hujjiyal al-ijmd', "the authoritativeness of consensus". Much was written about it in medieval Islam, as we shall see, and more variety has been added by modern Muslims. We should also expect to find some extensive historical study of the question by modern orientalists. But what has been written has generally been too brief, forming a part of a wider survey of Islamic consensus, or of Islamic law as a whole (1). The question has usually been thought to have been sufficiently dealt with by quoting the famous Tradition, &lt; My Community does not agree on an error", which was the major basis accepted for a thousand years. The historical weight of this Tradition, (1) References to standard works by modern Muslims and orientalists are given in ?? 14-15 and 17-18.</page><page sequence="2">GEORGES F. HOURANI however, should not obscure the existence of a considerable variety of opinion and expression in the past. The question seems to deserve treatment in a monograph which will, it is hoped, illuminate it by concentrating on it as a subject by itself and referring to other aspects of consensus only when they are seen as relevant (1). The subject will be treated primarily as intellectual history, showing the development of arguments in successive periods by leading thinkers. The social and religous background will be mentioned as helping to explain the tendencies of medieval and modern ages. But the main purpose of this article is not to explore the practical and other causes which created a favorable or unfavorable climate for the doctrine of consensus, but to review the justifying reasons accepted (or doubted) by Muslim jurists. Obviously to any intellectual class these are of great weight as causes of conviction. They have a logic of their own which makes their relations with each other, sometimes over periods of centuries, often more significant than their relations with contemporary events and conditions. This is particularly true for medieval Islamic thought, in an environment which changed comparatively little over a long time, and in which on the other hand there was a continuous intellectual tradition making it normal for later thinkers to be thoroughly familiar with what their predecessors of all periods had written. Critical comments on the arguments used will also be made. These will be given from the standpoint of a non-Muslim trying to find out what would be logically valid on this subject, given the basic Islamic assumption that the true religion was revealed by God to Muhammad in the Qur'dn. Thus no assump- (1) The closest to monograph treatment known to me to date is found in an unpublished doctoral dissertation by M. Z. Madina, *The classical doctrine of consensus in Islam", (University of Chicago, 1957). The first two chapters deal with the basis of consensus in the Qur'an and Traditions, as worked out by medieval scholars. I have found these chapters helpful as far as they go. 'All 'Abd ar- Raziq, al-ljmd' fl sh-sharl'a al-Isldmiya (Cairo, 1948), ch. 3, brings together many quotations, but offers little analysis.. 14</page><page sequence="3">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS tion is being made at all that consensus is an essential part of Islam, nor even that the Traditions of the Prophet are so, though they will be considered seriously. Still less is it assumed that every opinion of individual Muslim scholars like Shafi'i or Ghazali reflects accurately the original religion of Islam, however widespread their influence may have been. This approach needs no apology. It seems to the writer the only way to contri- bute to a further understanding of Islam, by Muslims and non- Muslims alike. A historical account alone will not do this, for however much it may clarify what Muslims in the past have actually thought, and why, it will leave us with no estimate of the Islamic validity of all this thought. No reference will be made to Shi'ite theories, except incidental- ly as influencing Sunnite thinking. It is felt that the latter can be studied as a fairly self-sufficient unit. "Islam" and its adjectives will be used conventionally as referring to the Sunnite tradition. MEDIEVAL ISLAM 3. 1 The practice of following consensus, as distinct from theories about it, goes back to pre-Islamic Arab society, in which the force of public approval generally backed any man's adherence to the sunna, the customary way of the ancestors. Sunna in this ancient sense means what Joseph Schacht has called "the living tradition", and as he points out it is closely connected with the idea of consensus (1). The Prophet imposed a sharp break with tradition, changing the concept of the community as well as many customary practices, and while he lived the practice of following consensus was largely superseded among Muslims by obedience to the judgements of the Qur'dn and Muhammad. But there can be (1) Origins of Muhammadan jurisprudence (Oxford, 1950), p. 58; and in Law in the Middle East, ed. M. Khadduri and H. J. Liebesny, I (Washington, 1955), 30. I.

HOURANI little doubt that a good deal of consultation went on before he made a decision, far more than is represented in the hero- worshipping biographies of Ibn Ishaq and others. And in any case, whatever may have been his own practice, there is no reason to think he discouraged his Companions from making agreed decisions during his absence or after his death. Thus it was normal that the first Caliph was elected by some kind of informal consensus, and this long-remembered event set the tone for many later proceedings. Without the Prophet, the early Muslims naturally reverted to a sensible procedure of their ancestors, only changing the source of public authority from the tribe to the religious community or umma. When the Umayyad dynasty came to power, they found support for their own legitimacy in the oath of loyalty, which supposedly bound the whole community to them and sanctioned their regime with unanimous public acclaim. Thus the state in the first century of Islam was not unfavorable to the idea of consensus of the Muslims, backing the ruling family. The early scholars from their side welcomed the idea of consensus in the sphere of law, as they were the mouthpieces and formulators of it, and during the first century they were able to develop it as a "living tradition", unhampered as yet by the weight of prophetic Traditions or of past consensus. Above all, there was a compelling religious reason, soon felt by all thoughtful Mus- lims: the need for a continuing human authority that would bind the community together by enlarging the nucleus of practice and belief established by the Prophet, through new interpretations and extensions. This need was felt desperately after the disas- trous schisms between Sunnis, Shi'a and Khawarij over the question of the Caliphate. Since the Sunnis could not find such an authority in an official priesthood, lacking in Islam, nor in the leadership principle sponsored by the Shi'a, they naturally turned to the community itself as the authority that would unite the faithful, all but the heretics, in a common body of law and doctrine. These are some of the aspects of early Islam which made consensus apt to be accepted in practice. But there was no conscious formulation of a theory at this time. It is probable 16</page><page sequence="5">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS that neither the Qur'dn nor any genuine Tradition contains such a formulation (1). Nor were the lawyers of the first century yet ready to frame theories to justify their evolving practice. 3. 2 Theories arose in the eighth century A.D., as part of the general growth of the science of Islamic jurisprudence (usul ash-shari'a). Various questions were posed about consensus. What was the constituting group whose unanimous opinion was binding: the entire community or the learned? On whom was consensus binding: on all future generations of Muslims or some- thing less than that? On what subjects: religious practice or doctrine or both? Was "independent" consensus authoritative, i.e. consensus which went beyond interpretation of the sacred texts to make new rulings not derived from them? What sanctions should enforce conformity to consensus? All these questions, though prominent in the classical writings, will not be discussed here, except in so far as differences in the answers given to them affect the answers given to our question. For convenience of reference, a standard definition of consen- sus is quoted here from a medieval source: "the agreement of independent scholars of Muhammad's Community in a particular period upon a legal decision." (2) This gives the constituting group and the range of subjects. But there was by no means an agreement on either of these points. With regard to the constituting group, for instance, Shafi'i thought of it as the entire Community, except on technic- (1) This is an opinion, which will be supported in the course of the article. Meanwhile, since a decision on the order of treatment has to be made, this opinion provides one reason why these two sources are not being examined at the present stage as bases for consensus. Another reason is that their significance for our subject depends largely on the varying interpretations given of them, so it will. be more accurate to examine them in the contexts of their interpreters through the centuries. Some judgements can then be made about the soundness of the inter- pretations in relation to the original sources. (2) Muhmmad b. Hamza al-Ghaffari (d. A. D. 1430/31), Fusil al-bada'i' fi usul ash-shard'i', quoted by 'Abd ar-Raziq, Ijmd', p. 6: itlifdqu 1-mujlahidlna min ummali Muhammadin ('alayhi s-saldmu) fi 'asrin 'aid hukmin shar'i. 2 17</page><page sequence="6">GEORGES F. HOURANI al matters, while the Hanbalites confined it to the Companions of the Prophet. In most of the discussions about the basis of consensus, however, the group is not specified, and the proofs relied on might apply to any group. Therefore I shall not spe- cify unless required by the argument to do so. With regard to subjects, the definition given is narrower than what was in fact the full range, since consensus determined not only questions of law but also a few essential elements of doctrine, such as a Muslim could not deny without going against the minimum creed of the religion. Nevertheless it is true that consensus was used more widely to determine matters of shar['a law, i.e. matters of religious-legal practice. The question with which we are concerned, about the basis on which the authority of consensus rests, is quite a sophisticated one, and for that reason was probably not the first in time of the questions raised by the legal theorists. We do not know what occasioned its first being asked. One obvious possibility is that it was stimulated by the challenge of Shi'ism. The Shi'a claimed authority for their imams, on the basis of the divine grace bestowed on the house of 'All to make infallible religious judgements. Over against this formidable claim, the Sunnis had to defend the rightness of their community as a whole. And since they could not do this on issues where there was dissension among themselves, their unanimous judgements were evidently the thing for which they might most easily claim divine guidance and religious authority. But we must hesitate to explain the origin of Sunnite statements on this question as a response to a Shl'i challenge, because the first statements arose in the early 'Abbasid period, when Shi'ism was in a dormant phase, and had not yet organized a militant intellectual propaganda. Before proceeding to a survey of the bases of support men- tioned in history in favor of consensus, it will be useful at this point to set forth a table of the main logical types into which they fall. (a) A text without a reason: i.e. a statement of Qur'dn or Tradition urging Muslims to follow consensus, but giving no argument for doing so. 18</page><page sequence="7">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS (b) A reason wilhout a text: i.e. an argument for following consensus which does not explicitly quote scripture. This heading, however, includes two sub-types with a significant theological difference between them. (i) A reason independent of anything in scripture. Some suggestions of this sort have been made in the modern age, but without validity as I hope to show. (ii) A reason which is an implication of scripture in its broad meaning, without being relatable to a particular text. (c) A text giving a reason. This type also may be subdivided. (i) A text giving an explicit reason, not requiring interpretation or deduction, such as the Tradition that asserts the infallibility of the Community. (ii) A text which implies a reason, to be drawn out by scholarly interpretation or deduction. Obviously the type which best satisfies the requirements of Islamic jurisprudence is (c,i), a text of Qur'dn or Tradition giving a reason in plain language. And this is in fact the type that became historically predominant. 4 The first known attempt to find an intellectual basis for consensus was made by Muhammad b. al-Hasan ash-Shaybani (A.D. 749-805), a disciple of Abfi Hanifa who was one of the earli- est Muslim writers of books on jurisprudence (1). Shaybani was a cautious advocate of the use of personal judgement (ra'y) in law, who nevertheless based his teaching on Traditions wherever possible (2). In his edition of Malik's Muwa!la', commenting on a particular decision he wrote: "The Muslims are agreed on this and approve of it, and it is related on the authority of the Prophet that everything of which the Muslims approve or disapprove is good or bad in the sight of Allah" (3). (1) See (Ibn) an-Nadim, al-Fihrist, ed. G. Flugel (Leipzig, 1872), p. 204; (Cairo, 1348 A.H.), pp. 287-88. Equally early is an argument of Malik b. Anas (d. 795) supporting the "living tradition" of the Madinese with two Qur'anic passages, but without referring to consensus. See R. Brunschvig, ( Polemiques medievales autour du rite de Malik ,, al-Andalus 15 (1950), pp. 377-435, especially pp. 381-82, 416-17. (2) "Shaibani", Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam (Leiden, 1953).

HOURANI Thus Shaybanl in generalizing the principle of consensus was careful to base it on a Tradition. The same Tradition was repeated in later works as supporting consensus, but was not much emphasized on account of certain weaknesses. For one thing, its isnad was incomplete, even though it contained the venerable name of 'Abdallah b. Mas'ud (1). Some reserve may also have been felt about the content of the Tradition. For although no doubt its proper interpretation is that the Muslims always see correctly what God has laid down as good, it could too easily be misunderstood as meaning that human opinion (ra'y), not God's decree, determines what is good and bad, and God merely follows with His approval. And anything approaching this social subjecti- vism in ethics, or vox populi vox Dei in theology, was sure to be rejected by all Muslim scholars as directly contrary to the religion of the Book (see ? 16) (2). For if God gives His believers a furqdn, a means of discriminating between true and false, good and evil (3), this means is evidently provided in the first place through the sharV'a, not through man's thinking. This was the predominant opinion, at any rate after the work of Shafi'T in jurisprudence. Shaybani's Tradition had a further weak- ness: it does not refer specifically to the unanimous approval or disapproval of the Muslims, thus it is too vague to be a deci- sive text favoring the doctrine of consensus. But with all these faults it did not fall entirely out of sight, for it did support, however vaguely, the major idea in classical thought about consensus, the idea of its infallibility.

See "Furkan", Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam. 20</page><page sequence="9">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS Another argument from the early 'Abbasid period, which foreshadows the classical argument, is recorded by Sha'fil, where he says that those scholars wvho reject Tradition altogether as a source of law "acknowledge the consensus on the ground that the Muslims, Allah willing, would not agree on any given doctrine unless they were right, and so their generality ('dmmaluhum) could not be mistaken as to the meaning of the Koran, even if individuals might be." (1) Schacht identifies these "anti-Traditionists" with the ahl al- kalam, by which Shafi'i meant the Mu'tazila. Their argument naturally does not quote a Tradition. Instead, it relies on an implication of the general spirit of Islam and the Qur'dn, quite in the Mu'tazilite manner of rational theology. It starts from the Islamic premisses of a benevolent God and an umma special- ly favored with divine grace (2). Hence it is inferred that for all of the Muslims to be mistaken would be a contradiction of this divine favor. The inference is not strictly justified, for God may favor a people with blessing but stop short of making them infallible. This argument is interesting as coming from the Mu'tazila, for the idea of a divine guarantee of the rightness of the umma comes close to assuming predestination of the umma's decisions, which we should expect to be contrary to the Mu'tazilite prin- ciple of man's power to choose, including the power to choose (1) Schacht, Origins, p. 41, summarizing Shafl'i, Kitdb al-umm (Bulaq, 1321-25 A.H.), VII, 252-53. But I have translated 'ammatuhum as "their generality", not "their majority". The primary meaning of the verb 'amma is "to be general, universal, common, comprehensive", etc., and it could not normally refer so speci- fically to a majority. "Their majority" would produce a rather extreme view of consensus: that even a majority of Muslims must be infallible. The reason for Schacht's understanding "majority" may have been the apparent difficulty of reconciling the totality not being mistaken with some individuals being mistaken. This would certainly be a contradiction if understood simultaneously. But I think the meaning is, "It is impossible that the Muslims could all be mistaken at once, though it is possible that some individual Muslims may be mistaken on other occasions, when there is no unanimity". This is the classical view of consensus. It is expressed more clearly in Shafi'i's statement of his own view, see below, ? 5. (2) See below, ? 7, for Qur'anic support, quoted in later times. 21</page><page sequence="10">GEORGES F. HOURANI error. It would not, however, be fair to refer to this as a definite doctrine, since all we have as evidence is brief statements of Shafi'T about some barely identified early thinkers, to whose general position he was himself opposed (1). 5 When we come to Shafi'i (767-820), we are dealing for the first time in Islamic history with a thoroughly systematic jurist whose views are well known from substantial writings of his own. The root idea of his jurisprudence may be described as theological positivism, the theory that the entire law of Islam is to be derived ultimately from sacred or sanctified sources, the Qur'dn and Traditions respectively. Analogical reasoning (qiyds) was not hard to fit into this theory, since it was no more than deduction, drawing out the implications of scripture, and thus akin to interpretation of scripture. But to follow human consensus as a legal source seemed somewhat remote from scripture, hence it is not surprising that Shafi'i was lukewarm about it. Since it was too well entrenched in his time to be rejected (and he may never have thought of that), he accepted it with qualifications (2) and sought to justify it by proofs within the framework of his system. As might be expected, Shafi'i looked for a proof in the Qur'dn. It is related that he searched the Book for three days, before he settled upon iv, 115: "But whoso makes a breach with the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows a way other than the believers' (1) Cf. a parallel early Christian argument for the infallibility of the Church, by Tertullian: "Suppose now that all [the Churches] have erred. ...[This would mean that] the Holy Spirit has not watched over any of them so as to guide it into the truth, although He was sent by Christ, and asked from the Father for this very purpose-that He might be the teacher of truth".

(1) The verse is understood as a direct injunction to follow consen- sus, without the mediation of any reason such as its infallibility. The proof depends on an identification of the "way of the believers", referred to obliquely in the verse, with the unanimous consensus of the continuing Muslim community. This is where its weakness lies, for the phrase is capable of other interpretat- ions: e.g. "the way of the believers" may mean "the way laid down for them in scripture." The story of Sh5fi'i's lengthy search, if true, must be understood to mean, not so much that he needed three days to light upon the relevant verses in the Book, with which he was perfectly familiar, but rather that he hesitated that long before accepting any verse as a proof. Shifi'i also quotes two Traditions ordering Muslims "to hold fast to the Community." (2) The interpretation he gives of these Traditions shows how he makes them a basis for the authority of consensus: "Q.: What is the proof for the authority of that on which men are agreed? A.: When the Prophet ordered men to hold fast to the community of Muslims, this could only mean that they were to accept the doctrine of the community; it is reasonable, too, to assume that the community cannot as a whole be ignorant of a ruling given by Allah and the Prophet. Such ignorance is possible only in individuals, whereas something on which all [Muslims] are agreed cannot be wrong and whosoever accepts such a doctrine does so in conformity with the sunna of the Prophet."

Cf. Risala, pp. 472-73. 23</page><page sequence="12">GEORGES F. HOURANI This answer of Shafi'i is important and deserves careful scrutiny. The "question" interprets the Tradition in a more specific sense than is apparent, understanding it as authorizing a cumulative, irrevocable obligation on all Muslims to accept every consensus. In his answer Shafi'i gives a reason, amount- ing to the same argument which he had found in the opponents of Tradition. It is, in fact, the later proof by infallibility, but stated as an argument, not as the Tradition "My Commun- ity does not agree on an error". Now this Tradition would certainly have been quoted by Shafi'T if it had been available to him, for it would have provided the ideal proof from his positivist viewpoint. Hence Schacht concludes that he did not know it-an inference which is unavoidable, except for the possible alternative that he had heard it but did not accept it as genuine (1). In either case it is significant for Shafi''s thought that he accepted the doctrine of infallibility even without a Tradition. The significance of this fact for the history of the Tradition itself is even greater, as will be pointed out (? 19). 6 After Shafi', and to some extent due to the force of his thought, there arose the great collections of Traditions, the standard commentaries on the Qur'dn, and the classical formul- ations of Sunnite jurisprudence in the compendia of the four schools. Consensus came to be accepted by all jurists as one of the four sources of law. Among the major practices imposed by consensus on lawyers was that of Iaqlrd, consultation of the standard law books of one's own school, with a corresponding abstinence from ijlihdd, the use of one's own judgement in discovering the law. The underlying assumption was that the standard decisions of the schools in detail were themselves now authorized by consensus and could not be overridden. While the growth of a body of law by precedent is familiar in other systems, in Sunnite Islam the doctrine of consensus and the almost complete closing of the gate of ijtihdd produced an unu- (1) Origins, p. 91. 24</page><page sequence="13">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS sually static law, within the spheres where it operated, such as family law, obligations and contracts, religious trusts (awqaf). But the situation was generally accepted and even welcomed by the legal profession from the ninth to the nineteenth centuries, except for a few original thinkers like the Zahirite Ibn Hazm and the Hanbalites Ibn Taymiya and Tawfi. This general compliance is reflected in the attitude of the majority of jurists toward the basis of consensus, which was thought of as some- thing to be established, not rejected. Even Zahirites and Han- balites only thought of limiting it. In the sphere of dogma the weight of consensus was less heavy, because there was less agreement in fact, and because many leading theologians, philosophers and mystics were disinclined to claim the existence of a consensus on points of belief beyond the minimum necessary for unity. After the schismatic conflicts of early Islam it was commonly felt as desirable to allow latitude in interpreting scripture, on matters which did not affect practice. For after all it was the way of life, the sharf'a, which for Muslims constituted the core of Islam. It would be an arduous task to make a complete survey of all that was written about the basis of consensus in the voluminous literature of Islamic law. It will be sufficient here to discuss some of the main texts and arguments that were relied upon, and the opinions of a few leading thinkers, and especially of the Shafi'ite Ghazali (1058-1111), whose treatment of the subject is the most thoroughgoing in medieval Islam. We may take our starting-point from a concise statement by him. After defining consensus as "agreement of the Community of Muham- mad, especially on a religious question", he writes: "Its authority is based on the impossibility of error by the Community; this is the whole matter. That it is an author- ity may be known by the Book, or by universally accepted Tradition (sunna mulawdlira), or by intellect ('aql). As for consensus, it is not possible to establish consensus by it" (1). (1) al-Muslasfa min 'ilm al-usil (Cairo, 1356/1937), I, 110, 111. For Ghazall's views on other aspects of consensus, see I.

HOURANI The four methods of proof mentioned here are parallel to the four standard sources of Islamic law; Qur'dn, Tradition, analogic- al deduction from scripture (qiyds), and consensus. The gene- ral correspondence of 'aql with qiyds will appear when we come to the intellectual argument (? 9). 7 Several verses of the Qur'dn are cited by medieval scholars in support of consensus. iv, 115, the one blessed by Shafi'i, is felt by Ghazali (1) to be the strongest, but he does not consider it to be a nass, a decisive textual proof. Of the commentators, Tabari (839-923) does not apply the verse to consensus; Baydawi (d. 1286?) does so, but with little discussion; while Zamakh- shari (1075-1144) does so with a reason, that the verse links disobedience to the Prophet with divergence from "the way of the believers" (2). The last point is also made by both Ibn Hazm (994-1064) and Ibn Taymiya (1263-1328) (3), but with a different emphasis, corresponding to their positivist purposes: to show that "the way of the believers" (understood as their consensus) is never independent but is always based on the Prophet's revelation or sunna, and "there is no decision of consensus which has not been previously expounded clearly by the Prophet" (4). Ibn Taymiya sees well that "the way of the believers" may refer to the way laid down for them by the Prophet. (1) Muslasfa, I, 112. (2) Tabari, Tafsir, ed. M.

Another Hanbalite, Najm ad-din at-Tawfi in an extensive but erratic criticism of this verse as a proof of consensus, makes at least one good point: that "the way of the believers" may be best understood in terms of the preceding verse, which has referred to "him who bids to freewill offering, or honour, or setting things right between the people".

But this is the crucial question, which is not settled by any argument of the medieval comment- ators or theologians, as far as is known to me. Perhaps this is why Ghazali thought the verse less than a nass. Of similar intent is iii, 98/103: "And hold you fast to God's bond, together, and do not scatter; remember God's blessing upon you when you were enemies, and He brought your hearts together, so that by His blessing you became brothers." The application is stated concisely by Sayf ad-din al-Amidi (1156-1233): "God has forbidden separation, and disagreement with consensus is separation" (1). This verse has considerable merits in its directness: it does enjoin the Muslims to keep together, and calls this brotherly unity of hearts a blessing of God. Certain words used would have effective associations for later Muslims: tafarraqui, "scatter", suggests the sects (firaq) into which the Community became divided when they failed to attain or follow consensus; jamV'an, "together", suggests ijlimd' and ijmd'. The verse does not mention the Prophet, and so it is without the distracting element which complicated the discussions of iv, 115. But in spite of these advantages it was not much relied upon by medieval authors. This may have been because it was felt that "God's bond" is rather a reference to the Qur'dn than to consensus. It must also be said that the precise doctrine of consensus can hardly be found in the verse; but this was not the kind of consideration to deter a medieval commentator. Two other verses were often cited, both demonstrating the divine favor bestowed on the Community. (a) "You are the best nation ever brought forth to men, bidding to honour (al-ma'ruif), and forbidding dishonour (al- munkar), and believing in God..." (iii, 106/110).

HOURANI Pazdawi (c. 1009-1089) says: "Their excellence (al-khayr'ya) implies the rightness of their consensus" (1). Baydawi says: "The verse has been used to prove that the Agreement of the Believers is a source of Law; for the verse makes it certain that they enjoined everything right and forbad everything wrong, the article here [with ma'ruf and munkar] being universalizing. Now were they to agree to what is false, their conduct would be the reverse" (2). It is a fair criticism of these learned doctors to say that they have turned a general statement into a universal one. They have made a leap which is not justified by the text, and which they would never have thought of unless the doctrine of consen- sus had already been present to their minds. (b) "Thus We appointed you a midmost nation (ummatan wasafan) that you might be witnesses to the people, and that the Messenger might be a witness to you; ..." (ii,137/143). Taken in its context, wasalan appears to mean "in the middle", between other people whom the Muslims will witness against and Muhammad who will certify the Muslims as reliable wit- nesses. This is well explained by Zamakhshari: "Some nations have chosen to reject the Prophet's mission. On the Day of Judgement God will ask the prophets [sent to other nations] if they have delivered their messages, and the Muhammadan Community will then be summoned as witnesses. ...Then Muhammad will be summoned and questioned about the condition of his Community, and he will certify it (yuzakkThd) and testify to its justice ('add- lalihd)" [i.e. its qualification to be a witness, 'adl] (3). If this is correct, then the Community is at least proclaimed superior to other nations and possessing the sense of justice and (1) Kanz al-wusul ild ma'rifat al-usuil, with commentary of 'Abd al-'Aziz al- Bukhari, in Kashf al-asrdr (Constantinople, 1307-8 A.H.), III, 975.

The attribution to the Qur'dn of the technicalities of later Islamic law is anachronistic, but the general argument may stand. 28</page><page sequence="17">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS the good character required in witnesses. Baydawi and Ibn Taymlya both reason that the Community's being appointed as certified witnesses implies that they cannot as a Community give false testimony, hence their unanimous opinion is always free from error (1). This is stretching the meaning of the verse rather too far, because the qualification of a witness is something less than to be infallible. Wasalan is also often interpreted, by Tabari and Baydawi for example, (2) as "holding to the mean", in the Aristotelian sense of moderation between vicious extremes. This interpretation would strengthen the argument for the perfection of the Com- munity; but it probably reads too much into the word in its Qur'anic context. A few more verses were sometimes listed in support of consen- sus, but add no strength to those already mentioned (3). Reviewing the arguments from the Qur'dn as a whole, we can conclude that none of them is quite decisive. Some verses undoubtedly recommend unity to the Community, while others commend the Community as a superior people. But to conclude from either kind that the Qur'an makes it a duty for Muslims to follow the accumulated consensus of all past generations is a step beyond anything that the scripture of Islam would seem to warrant, taken by itself without preconceptions derived from later writings or felt needs. 8 Ghazali's opinion was that the sunna of the Prophet, as known by Traditions, provides the strongest proof of the authority of consensus (4). Of the several Traditions used, two (1) Baydawi, Anwdr, ad loc.; Ibn Taymiya, Ma'drij, pp.81-84: Laoust, p. 19. Tawfi, Risala, p. 103, objects that infallibility in giving true witness does not imply infallibility in judging right and wrong. (2) Tabari, Tafsir, III, 141-45; Baydawi, Anwdr, ad loc. (3) E.g. iv, 59/62, enjoining obedience to God, the Messenger "and those in authority (iul l-amri) among you". It was disputed whether the last phrase refers to rulers or religious authorities or both. If the second, the text might be a support for obeying consensus. See below, ? 13, on Muhammad 'Abduh's interpre- tation. (4) Mustasfa, I, 111. 29</page><page sequence="18">GEORGES F. HOURANI have been mentioned before. "Hold fast to the Community" had the prestige of Shafi''s backing. It has a similar force to Qur'an iii, 98/103, as a clear general recommendation of Islamic solidarity. "Whatever the Muslims see as good is good with God", etc., has the defects previously pointed out. It is cited by Amidi (1) but not by Ghazali. The group of Traditions on which most reliance was placed were those which make a plain assertion of the infallibility of the Community. The wording varies slightly in two different versions: (a) "My Community does not agree on a mistake (khala')" or (b) "on an error (dalala)". The first version was regarded as weak in its isndd, and is not listed by Wensinck from any of the standard collections. The second was accepted as sound, and is listed by Wensinck (2). But there is no signi- ficant difference between khala' and dalala (3). Another Tra- dition which yields the same conclusion is: "There will always be a group in my Community maintaining the truth, unharmed by deserters and dissenters, until the Judgement of God arrives" (4). This was seen to imply that whenever the Community is unani- mous it cannot be on an error. Ibn Hazm objects that the Tradition only asserts that a wrong view will always have oppo- nents disagreeing with it, and says nothing about the state of agreement (5). But in fact the implication for consensus is clear and cannot be ignored. Of the various Traditions giving the same meaning, Ghazali concludes that the common meaning is certainly authentic (1) Ihkam, I, 313. (2) A. J. Wensinck, Concordance el indices de la tradition musulmane (Leiden, 1933- ), I, 93-96, and A Handbook of early Muhammadan tradition (Leiden, 1927), pp. 47-48, s.v. "Community". See Madina, "Classical doctrine", pp. 36 ff. (3) This is Ghazali's position, Mustasfd, I, 113, as against a rather arbitrary distinction made by Ibn IHazm, Ihkam, Pt. 4, p. 131.

Faruki, Islamic jurisprudence (Karachi, 1962), p. 154. 30</page><page sequence="19">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS (mulawdlir bil-ma'nd), even if each one by itself is not (1). And this was the general opinion of the medieval Sunni jurists. When once their authenticity was thus accepted, by the tra, ditional tests of isndd-criticism, the doctrine of infallibility seemed to be on an unshakable basis, since the assertion of the Traditions was plain and not open to doubts of interpretation. And so things remained, putting at rest all questions about the authority of consensus, until modern times when the question of authenticity has been raised again. Criticisms on this score will be reserved for a later section (? 19). 9 The "intellectual proof" mentioned by Ghazal (2) amounts to an argument by analogy with something universally admitted by Muslims. In the sphere of hadilh criticism it was admitted by all that some Traditions (those known as mulawltir) could be accepted as certainly reliable on the ground that they were accepted by all the Companions, and these were sufficiently numerous so that they could not all have been deliberate liars or all mistaken. For the same reason, it was argued, when the Companions agreed unanimously that a judgement in law or theology was certainly correct (maqlu'an bihi), they could not all have been liars or mistaken. Ghazall thinks the argument is weak, because a number of people sufficient to constitute iawdlur evidence for historical reports, such as the Traditions of Islam, may yet be mistaken in the differenct sphere of legal and theological judgements. For example, the Jews or Christians are numerous enough as historical witnesses of events in the past, but their unanimous agreement in their respective communities that Muhammad is not a prophet is not above error; in fact it is erroneous. There is a difference in the two spheres. The condition for a mula- wdlir Tradition is that it must be based on sensation or some other kind of immediate perception of the witnesses, where (1) Mustasfd, I, 111-12. See Madina, "Classical doctrine", pp. 48-50. (2) Mustasfa, I, 114. 31</page><page sequence="20">GEORGES F. HOURANI there is no possibility of divergence between the perceptions of different persons. In the case of consensus, on the other hand, the object of agreement is a matter of theory (nazarr), e.g. whether a legal judgement is correct, on which competent people may hold divergent opinions; "and it is not impossible in the usual course of events (fi l'ada) that a group constituting lawdiur [on Traditions] should be unanimously mistaken about this." Here Ghazali uses the terminology of the Ash'arite theologians, in which any regularity in the world is attributed to God's "habit" ('ddal Allah), not to "nature" (at-tabf'a) (1). He means to say that, according to the laws of valid evidence in the world as it is ordinarily, a lawdiur group would not guarantee the correctness of a community's theoretical judgement. The infallibility of the consensus of the Muslim Community is, therefore, only guaranteed by a divine favor (karamat Allah), a "breaking of habit" (kharq al-'dda) by God which amounts to a miracle. Such a miracle was not granted to any other commu- nity. Its existence in the case of Islam cannot be inferred from any fact of ordinary experience or any principle of pure reason (2); it is known only through the positive divine sources (sam'lyda)-in this case through Traditions. Ghazali's criticism of the "intellectual proof" can be accepted. Indeed we may go further, by realizing that even the first leg of the analogy, the mulawdair Tradition, can no longer be regarded as stable. Historians today take a rather more sceptical view of "unanimous" reports handed down orally from a distant past, whether in Islamic or other civilizations. The early argument of rational theology, attributed by Shafi' to the Mu'tazila (above, ?4), was apparently not revived (1) See Ibn Rushd, Tahftful at-tahdfut, ed. M. Bouyges (Beirut, 1930), pp. 531- 32; L. Gardet and M. Anawati, Introduction d la theologie musulmane (Paris, 1948), p. 353. (2) Cf. Tawfi, Risala, p. 107: "If consensus were an authority, this would be either by the essence of the consenters or by the witness of scripture to their infalli- bility. The first is invalid: the consenters are not infallible by their essence, because no impossibility follows for their essence from the supposition of their lack of infallibility". 32</page><page sequence="21">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS in later Islam. That argument started from the premiss of the divine favor of God to Muslims, known generally from the Qur'dn. Later theology, more systematic and positive, was not content with such a vague premiss but sought for specific passages in the revealed sources to substantiate the divine favor. In any case, any tendency to develop this type of argu- ment was half-hearted, after the acceptance of the Traditions which stated unambiguously that the Community was not liable to error. 10 It was evident to the jurists that the authority of consensus could not be based on a consensus of the same kind, as this procedure would set up a vicious circle, or (in another metaphor) an infinite chain (1). But evidently the classical theory which relies on Traditions was attacked on the ground that it involun- tarily commits this fallacy. Ghazali states and answers the attack as follows: "Objection: 'You have proved consensus by the Tradition, then proved the soundness of the Tradition by consensus. Granting that there was a consensus on its soundness, what is the proof that what they have agreed to be sound is sound in fact? And what is the dispute about but this?' "Answer: This is not so. We have proved consensus by the Tradition, but the soundness of the Tradition by the absence through the centuries of objections to it and disagreement with it, whereas the usual course of events (al-'dda) requires a denial that a decisive principle by which sure decisions are made could be established by a Tradition of unknown soundness. So we know by the usual course of events, not by consensus, that a Tradition is decisive (maq!u'an bihi) (2). (1) See Ghazali, Mustasfa, I, 111, quoted above, ? 6; Tawfl, Risala, p. 103; ShawkSni, quoted without reference in 'A. 'Abd ar-fRaziq, ljma', p. 39; M. al- Khulari, Usfl al-ftqh, 3rd ed. (Cairo, 1937), p. 279. (2) Mustasfa, I, 112. 3 33</page><page sequence="22">GEORGES F. HOURANI The objection is clear enough. It proceeds on the assumption that the Tradition, supporting the authority of consensus, is to be accepted on the strength of a second consensus, that of all the witnesses unanimously attesting the veracity of the Tradi- tion. But this second consensus has no weight unless some rea- son has already been given to believe that consensus hits the truth. As this is the very point at issue, the second consensus takes us no further forward than the first. Ghazali's answer can best be understood in the light of the concepts of tawdtur and 'dda explained in the last section. Where he writes "This is not so" he is denying that the Tradi- tion is proved authentic by a consensus in its favour. It is authenticated, he says, by mutawdtir evidence, which is consider- ed sound not through mere unanimity of opinion but because it is a result of very many witnesses' hearing and seeing the Prophet speaking, or hearing the first-hand witnesses reporting it to them, and the absence of any contrary witness. Thus the Tradition is known to be sound by the rules of historical evidence in the ordinary state of the world ('ada). An important prin- ciple of law, such as consensus, he concludes, could not be based on anything less solid than this. Perhaps Ghazali's argument can be made clearer by a reference to a Roman Catholic argument in a closely analogous situation. The doctrine of the infallibility of the Church (not the Pope) has been attacked on the ground that it rests on statements of a scripture, and that the authenticity of that scripture is gua- ranteed, in turn, by a Church regarded already as infallible. A writer in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1) has refuted the charge of a logical vicious circle by delineating the correct argument carefully in three steps. (a) It starts from the scriptures "merely as reliable historical sources", which give us a trustworthy report of Christ's sayings and promises. (b) "Christ's promises to the Apostles and their successors in the teaching office include the promise of such guidance and assistance as clearly implies infallibility". (1) P. J. Toner, "Infallibility", Catholic Encyclopaedia, VII (New York, 1910), 701. 34</page><page sequence="23">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS (c) Proceeding from here, it is possible "to rely on the Church's authority for proof of what writings are inspired." The decisive feature of this argument is that no assumptions of an infallible community or an inspired scripture are made at the first step. It is based on ordinary historical evidence, such as (it is claimed) would convince any intelligent person. The argument is unassailable on logical grounds. Any cri- ticism has to be directed at the truth of the premisses or of the assumptions behind them. The fallacy suggested in the preceding objections is that of infinite regress. It is quite possible, however, to have a single regress without leading to infinity. An instance is to be found in Ibn Khaldfn's justification of consensus as a source of obli- gations. "Then consensus takes its place next to those two [Qur'an and sunna], because of the consensus of the Companions to disapprove of those who disagreed with them; and they would not have done so without a positive basis (mustanad), because such men do not agree [upon anything] without a firm proof" (1). The argument can be analysed as follows: (a) The consensus of the Community is authoritative because it has been validated by the precedent established by the Compa- nions in consensus. (b) The Companions' consensus is based, not on another consensus, but on their correct understanding of the positive sources amply available to them, i.e. the Qur'dn and the sunna of the Prophet. There is nothing logically vicious here. But Ibn Khaldun may' have felt it to be too complicated, for he immediately adds: "There is also the evidence of textual proofs that the Community is infallible." Here he refers to the standard Traditions. (1) al-Muqaddima, ed. E. Quatremere, Prolegomenes d'Ebn Khaldoun (Paris, 1858), III, 17. Cf. 18-19 for a shorter repetition. My translation owes something to that of F. Rosenthal, The Muqaddimah (London, 1958), III, 23-24. 35</page><page sequence="24">GEORGES F. HOURANI Ibn Khaldun, however, rather spoils his record in another passage, where he is dealing with the authority of the sunna, and justifies it by consensus: "The sunna, as it has been transmitted to us, is justified by the [Companion's] consensus on the obli- gation to act in accordance with its sound parts, as we have mentioned" (1). This is circular, for he has just said that the authority of the Companions' consensus rests on the positive basis of the Qur'ain and sunna. 11 Before we pass from medieval Sunnite Islam we should take note of the special viewpoint of the Hanbalites on the sources of law, which led them to a different emphasis in the proofs of the authority of consensus (2). The Hanbalite movement may be described as a protestant reformation, in another sense than the Shafi'ite and Zahirite movements. In Hanbalism the stress in less on the texts of revelation as understood by contemporary scholarship, and more on the texts as understood by the earliest Muslims (salaf), the Companions of the Prophet, and on his life as imitated in their practice. It was felt that the primitive Community knew far more about the Prophet's ways of living and judgement than anything that has been preserved in surviving oral tradition or written records, and that later generations in turn know far more about that primitive Community than they know directly about the Prophet. The primitive Community is thus an indispen- sable link of knowledge between the Founder of Islam and the Muslims of later times. We may consider the implications of this doctrine for the theory of consensus as worked out in the thought of the most systematic Hanbalite jurist, Ibn Taymiya. The first point to notice is the de-emphasis on the consensus of the later Com- (1) Quatremere, III, 18, with a reference to 17. Rosenthal, III, 25 and 23. The passage referred to, 17, shows that the consensus mentioned is that of the Companions. This does not avoid the circularity. (2) This section owes much to the classic study of H. Laoust, Essai sur les doctrines sociales el politiques de Taki-d-din Ahmad b. Taimiya (Cairo, 1939), pp. 239- 42. 36</page><page sequence="25">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS munity as a source of law, for it was precisely the overworking of this source by the other schools that was believed to have led to wandering from original Islam and unlicensed developments of the teachings of God and the Messenger. In spite of the Tradition "My Community does not agree on an error", which he does not reject, Ibn Taymiya feels that infallibility is an unconvincing doctrine when applied to the entire continuing Community of Muslims, liable as it is to the weaknesses of humanity. Why should they not be in error, unless they are close to a Prophet? Here Ibn Taymiya was influenced by the Shi'ite theorist Hilll, who defined consensus in terms of agree- ment with the thoughts of a living imam. For the Sunnites, correspondingly, the only consensus that could be convincingly held infallible, according to Ibn Taymiya, was that of the Companions. In this view, the Tradition was thought to be backed by precise reasons showing why the Companions in particular were so authoritative. Two qualities commended them. One was their unequaled moral probity. It was a characteristic thought of Sunnite Islam that grace has diminished with distance from the Prophet. This was expressed in the Tradition, "The best men are those of my generation, then those who follow them. Then falsehood will spread" (1). The other quality, closely linked with the first, was their nearness to the Prophet, which enabled them to have a unique personal knowledge of his teaching, his manner of life and thinking, anc the circumstances in which he received revelations and gave injunctions (2). The conclusion to be drawn, then, was that those men would be extremely unlikely to be unanimously in error regarding the original teachings of Islam. (1) As quoted by Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddima, I, 393, as tr. F. Rosenthal, I, 447. Many references in Wensinck, Handbook, p. 48. In the ordinary Sunnite view the spread of falsehood would not be universal, so that this Tradition does not contra- dict "My Community does not agree on an error". (2) Ibn Taymiya, Ma'arij, pp. 35-36: Laoust, Contribution, p. 110. Cf. the saying of Abt Hanlfa, "An hour's session of one of them [the Companions] with the Prophet, blessing and peace on him, is better than the learning of years". Quoted by M. Abt Zahra, Abii Hlanlfa, 2nd ed. (Cairo, 1955), p. 315, without reference to source. 37</page><page sequence="26">GEORGES F. HOURANI This argument follows a line of historical source criticism, not needing the intervention of any special providence to establish freedom from error, except in so far as the goodness of the Companions might be thought providential. The conclusion, infallibility of the Companions, is more limited than the standard doctrine, and takes a more cautious attitude to evidence; and it is surely stronger for that reason. MODERN ISLAM AND WESTERN SCHOLARSHIP 12 So there remained in the later Middle Ages two traditions, side by side in permitted disagreement (ikhtildf): the "catholic" majority supporting the continuous authority of the Community by scriptural proofs, and the Hanbalite "protestants" not deny- ing the proofs but restricting their application to the authority of the Companions, by reason of their blessed closeness to the Prophet. In modern Islam, beginning in the nineteenth century, the whole situation has changed: not as yet through new proofs of any value, as will be shown, but by virtue of a changed attitude to consensus itself as a source. For, whereas medieval intellec- tuals had been mainly concerned to preserve their Islamic world as they knew and loved it, and had found in consensus an effective means thereto, the distinctively modern trend has been to adapt the contemporary Islamic world to new conditions of life, without departing from the basic ideas of original Islam. Seeing, therefore, a barrier to adaptation in the medieval doc- trine of the authority of all past consensus, modernists have often striven to find it no part of original Islam. This effort has had a note of urgency, lacking in the corresponding discussions of infallibility in Catholic circles, on account of the different subject-matter of consensus in Islam. The pronouncements of the Catholic church that have been claimed as infallible have been mostly on matters of theology, supposedly eternal verities which could, at any rate, be allowed to stand unchanged for a 38</page><page sequence="27">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS very long time. By contrast, the subjects dealt with by Islamic consensus have been mainly practical ones, as has been seen, calling for repeated decisions in action which would affect individuals and the community from day to day, or from year to year. Thus the doctrine of consensus has been under conti- nual review by modern Muslim lawyers and social thinkers, rather than theologians. For illustration of modernist thought concerning the basis of consensus I shall consider the theories of two reformers, Muhammad 'Abduh and Kemal Faruki. 13 The Egyptian 'Abduh (1849-1905) understood Islam as a revealed religion, which at the same time encouraged full use of reason within the natural order and pursuit of the public interest (maslaha) as the primary end of action (1). In other words, he proclaimed independent thinking (ijlihdd) as the right and duty of those competent to perform it in every age, and denied that priority in time necessarily meant superior wisdom, except in the case of the Companions and Successors. Indeed, later ages have had two persistent reasons to modify decisions by their predecessors: one is the growth of understanding through experience, and learning from their mistakes (2), the other is the constant change of historical circumstances, which makes obsolete and harmful many rules of life which were suitable to former conditions. Hence 'Abduh considered it one of his chief aims "to liberate thought from the shackles of traditionalism (faqlld)" (3), the following of past authorities without reflection, out of reverence for the past. 'Abduh made it quite clear that he included in this liberation the freedom of Muslims from the obligation to follow past consensus merely as such, and so went on record as opposing the classical doctrine of consensus. His view is stated in the Manar commentary on Qur'dn iv, 59/63: (1) See A. Hourani, Arabic thought in the liberal age (Oxford, 1962), pp. 139 nf.; C. C. Adams, Islam and modernism in Egypt (Oxford, 1933). (2) Risdlat at-tawhid, ed. M. Rashid Rida, 4th ed. (Cairo, 1371 A.H.), pp. 158-59; Fr. tr. B. Michel and M.

HOURANI "O believers, obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you..." This sentence had sometimes been taken as supporting obedience to consensus, but more often not used for this purpose because of the difficulty of equating "those in authority" (uli l-amri) with the Community as a whole or its learned representatives. 'Abduh, however, takes the phrase as meaning all the Muslim leaders of the Community-rulers, generals, scholars, etc.- and thinks the verse enjoins obedience to them when they are in agreement on a real interest which is not contrary to scrip- ture (1). But this obedience is not unlimited in time. Inevit- ably the consensus of one age conflicts with that of another, and even a single age may revise its consensus if it finds that in the public interest. "For their obligation to obey consensus is due to the public interest, not to infallibility as asserted in the [books on] principles of law; and interest appears and disappears, and varies with different times and conditions, such as strength and weakness [of the Community], etc. This is different from the disobedience to consensus which the early Muslims forbade, by which [consensus] they meant the true views of religion attained by the Companions and Successors, without any disagreement being reliably reported of any of their learned men. And the apparent meaning of Shafi'i in his Risala is that this is the consensus which is reckoned as valid, and I think Ahmad [b. Hanbal] held the same view. Clearly it is unreasonable to hold that the men of the first age agreed on a religious matter without its becoming a principle of religion. But what has this to do with the sayings or silence imputed to independent scholars after them, on matters which were unheard of in the best centuries-especially when the rest of the Muslims did not agree with these scholars?" (2) 'Abduh's view as stated here shows several affinities. Its theological method is Mu'tazilite, since the conclusions are (1) Ed. M. Rashid Rida, Tafsir al-Qur'an al-haklm (Cairo, 1927-36), V, 180-81. (2) Tafsrr, V, 208-09. 40</page><page sequence="29">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS deduced from a view of what Islam is as a whole, a religion of reason, rather than worked out by close philological interpre- tation of revealed texts. In its ethical theory it is utilitarian, holding the public interest as the supreme standard of value (and thus also the goal of the religion of reason). And in its conclusion it is Hanbalite, accepting as permanently valid only the consensus of the earliest Muslims, without denying a limited weight to later consensus. This Hanbalite aspect was deve- loped by 'Abduh's disciple Rashid Rida, as is well known. But the shaykh had to face the classical textual "proofs", and it is of interest to inspect how he dealt with them. His comments on Qur'dn ii, 137/143 and iii, 106/110 make no refe- rence to consensus. In iii, 98/103 he takes "God's bond" to be the Qur'dn itself, and "holding fast...together" to it to be the desirable unity or consensus in following it (1). "The agreement is just the holding fast" (wa innamd l-ijtimd'u huwa nafsu l-i'tisdm). Thus consensus has no separate authority. He understands iv, 115 as referring to "the way of the believers" in the Prophet's time, not later. He is conscious that this verse has been used as a basis for the authority of consensus in the classical tradition but does not accept that it does so; adding that the only verse which proves "the real consensus" is iv, 59/ 62, enjoining obedience to those in authority (2). His interpre- tation of the latter verse has been explained above. In the course of his lengthy comment on Qur'dn iv, 59/62 'Abduh brings up the Tradition "My Community does not agree on an error" and its variants, and discusses the classical use of it to support the claim that a consensus must never oppose an earlier consensus (3). He gives two reasons why the Tradition does not prove the claim. (a) The consensus of the classical jurists, which has traditionally been held authoritative, cannot be considered to be the same as the consensus of the Community. So if the latter is pronounced infallible by the Tradition, the former is not necessarily so, and the traditional practice of (1) Tafsir, IV, 19-20. (2) TafsTr, V, 417. (3) Tafsir, V, 209. 41</page><page sequence="30">GEORGES F. HOURANI laqlld, relying on the opinions of the founders of the four law schools, breaks down. (b) The consensus of any group is a result of a process of inde- pendent judgement (ijlihdd) by each individual. But an intellectual mistake (khafa') in ijlihdd is not reckoned as a moral error (dalala); if the mujtahid is qualified and tries hard to arrive at the truth, he is doing his duty (1). Thus there could be a unanimous "mistake" (kha(a') by the qualified scholars which would not be a unanimous "error" (dalala); so that the Tra- dition does not rule out the possibility of mistakes and permissi- bility of revising consensus. Of these two reasons, (a) makes a fair point, though it does not seem decisive. The working definition of "the Community" in this context has given rise to a vast amount of discussion in medieval and modern times. It would be idle to attempt to go into this question here, and it is preferable not to offer a firm opinion. All I shall say is that, even if 'Abduh's argument is accepted, it does not deny the infallibility of someone or other, whether the whole Community or representatives of it, so that the doctrine of cumulative consensus, in some form or other, is untouched. Perhaps this is why 'Abduh thought a second argument necessary. (b) seems plainly weak, since it depends on an untenable distinction between the words khaLa' and dalala, and in any case the Tradition exists in the form khata'-though less well attested by its isndd, as mentioned above (? 8). In sum, 'Abduh dealt prudently with the Qur'anic proofs, but appears to have been floundering in face of the standard Tra- dition. As an honest scholar, equipped only with the classical apparatus of historical criticism, he did not have the means to challenge its authenticity. All he could do was to reinterpret it in a sense that would render it harmless to his modernist understanding of Islam, but in doing so he could not stand up to the objections of even the old-fashioned philology. This is (1) An allusion to the well-known Tradition, "If the judge after exerting his mind makes a right decision, he will have a double reward; and if he makes a wrong decision he will [still] have a single reward".

"ijtahada". 42</page><page sequence="31">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS typical of the difficulties of early Islamic modernism, as shown by Sir Hamilton Gibb in his masterly critique, Modern trends in Islam (1). As for 'Abduh's own limited doctrine of consensus, it is very sensible like all his practical teaching, but can hardly be drawn precisely from the Qur'anic injunction "Obey... those in authority among you" (iv, 59/63) as he claims. Here, as in other interpretations, the shaykh's idealism outran his scholar- ship. A just assessment of the Mandr Commentary has been given by Ahmad Amin (1886-1954): "It is a practical commentary, expounding the present and explaining its causes; a moral one, summoning men to action according to the principles of Islam and showing it as the source of happiness in all ages; and a spiritual one, summoning to elevation of the soul to the higher world" (2). 14 A contemporary Pakistani thinker, Kemal A. Faruki, takes a somewhat similar position to 'Abduh's, and with the same end in view, to allow for the operation of a consensus that would be a vehicle for change in Islamic society, not a petrifying force. Thus, like 'Abduh, he thinks that scripture upholds the authority of consensus, but in a limited sense (3). Faruki accepts the usual texts of Qur'dn and Traditions as proofs that the Islamic Community is infallible in some sense, but seeks to determine the limits of this infallibility as intended by scripture. He argues from general considerations of theology and ethics, in the manner of the Mu'tazila. First of all he points to the contrast between God and man, indicated by many verses of the Qur'dn. God alone has unlimited infallibility. The limits of man's infallibility in matters of ethical and legal judgement are set by the variation of circumstances in different times and places, and the judgement that is right for one age or country is necessarily not so for other ones that differ in ethically (1) (Chicago, 1947), pp. 68-84. (2) Zu'amd' al-islah fi l-'asr al-hadilh (Cairo, 1949), p. 329. (3) Ijma' and the gate of ijiihad (Karachi, 1954), and Islamic jurisprudence (Karachi, 1962). 43</page><page sequence="32">GEORGES F. HOURANI relevant respects. Thus the infallibility of consensus can mean at most that its collective judgement is always sound for the local and temporal conditions for which it is intended. "Consequently, we must acknowledge, without hesitation, the correctness of a past ijmd' of the community within its given time-space context, i.e. presence, and yet, at the same time, we are fully entitled, indeed obliged, to exert fresh ijlihad and come to fresh ijmd' rulings on the same problems, when necessary, within the changed presence, or time-space context, of the living community" (1). Thus Faruki neatly avoids the dubious exegeses of Muhammad 'Abduh, by basing his argument on legitimate general consider- ations. Applying such considerations to the standard Tradi- tion, he is saying that "error"-and its opposite "rightness"- must be understood as relative to time and place. Now ethical relativism in this sense (not to be confused with subjectivism) is indeed obvious to anyone who thinks about morality, and has been accepted by most ethical philosophers, from Aristotle onwards. So it is reasonable to believe that Muhammad allowed for it in the saying "My Community does not agree on an error". Faruki is not troubled by any doubts about the authenticity of the Traditions. Yet it is just here that the Achilles' heel of any Islamic argument for infallible consensus lies, as will be shown toward the end of this article (?19). 15 These are two examples out of many modernists, with various shades of opinion on consensus. On the other side are those Muslim scholars who have accepted the traditional view of it on the traditional grounds. A well-expressed statement of their view is that of Muhammad al-Khudari (d. 1917) (2). In between the extremes there are scholars who are content to report the traditional view, without any apparent conviction (1) Islamic jurisprudence, pp. 156-57. (2) Usul al-fiqh, pp. 279-80. 44</page><page sequence="33">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS of their own (1). This happens, presumably, because on one hand they feel it impossible to deny or ignore the classical doctrine, while on the other hand they do not see consensus as an active procedure of modern Islam and have no wish to revive the binding force of the consensus of the past. 16 It is time now to look in another direction, and ask whether western scholarship has anything to contribute to the question. I shall begin with a plausible argument for infallibility which might be derived from a certain western theory of ethics. This is the theory known as conventionalism or social subjecti- vism, which was held by some Greek sophists and attacked by Plato, was restated by Hume, and is quite popular in our time. The basic assertion is that in any community the standards of right and wrong are set by the general opinion, sentiment and traditions of the community, i.e. that communal attitudes define value. In our context we cannot do better than quote the statement of this view by the Turkish sociologist Ziya G6kalp (1876-1924), whose outlook owed much to the writings of Rmile Durkheim: "Value... reflects the emphasis society places on certain things which do not intrinsically have the properties implied in the value judgements. The family believes in the respectability of the father, the nation in the sacred- ness of the soil or of the flag. Therefore, the validity of a value judgement is not determined by its correspondence to a physical object in the external world, but by its corres- pondence to a social reality which exists in the minds of people. In other words, what the value judgment refers to is found, not in the nature of things but in the beliefs of society" (2). From this theory the infallibility of the community follows as a logical consequence. For, since the approval of a whole (1) E.g. Mahma$ani, Falsafat at-tashri' fl l-Isldm, pp. 117-18, Eng. tr., pp. 76-77. (2) Turkish nationalism and western civilization: selected essays of Ziya GOkalp, Eng. tr. and ed. N. Berkes (London and New York, 1959), p. 148. 45</page><page sequence="34">GEORGES F. HOURANI community is by definition what makes a practice right for its members, any unanimous consensus of that community neces- sarily prescribes the right; hence the community is infallible in its moral judgements. Such an argument could be applied to the Community of Islam as the standard-setting group for Muslims. Islamic textual support for it might then be found in the Tradition quoted by Shaybani, "Whatever the Muslims see as good is good with God", etc. (above, ? 4), understanding "good with God" as "really, necessarily good", so that the whole sentence would be merely a religious way of expressing the social sub- jectivist definition of value. To my knowledge no Muslim has in fact applied the argument to Islam, including G6kalp for whom the primary value-creating community was the nation (millet), not the international Muslim iimmel (1). But I have made the application here, to show the complete range of possible theories. It should be noted that the argument, if correct, would prove not merely the limited infallibility upheld by the Muslim refor- mers but the cumulative infallibility of classical Islam. For, since the existing social consensus would always set the standard of right, no criticism of it could be right and no departure from it could ever be justified, except where the consensus has set limits to its own validity. There are, however, two absolutely fatal objections to the whole theory, from the directions of modern ethical philosophy and Islamic theology. From the side of ethics, the objection is (1) Cf. Turkish nationalism, p. 185, foot, with p. 224, top. See also p. 171, foot. But Gokalp seems to have been aware of the corresponding implication within the national community, for he developed a doctrine of 6Ir (Arabic 'urf) in the nation which parallels the doctrine of infallible ijma' in Islam. Orf is the collective social consciousness, "both social rules of conduct and the social conscience (vicdan)", (p. 153). The translator renders 6rf as mores. So "there can never be rejected mores. Mores are those rules which are accepted by the whole community". (Ibid.). Gokalp even quotes the Tradition, "Whatever the believers (sic, al- mu'minuna) see as good is good with God", in support not of Islamic ijmd' but of national 6rf (p. 194). This is rightly called "a highly arbitrary interpretation" by U. Heyd, Foundations of Turkish nationalism (London, 1950), p. 87, n. 2. In general see Heyd, Foundations, pp. 50 fT., 85-88, and Gibb, Modern trends in Islam, p. 92. 46</page><page sequence="35">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS that the definition of value from which the reasoning proceeds is untrue; for we speak about values in many ways which this definition is unable to account for. In G6kalp's first example quoted above, "respectability" implies a characteristic of the father as deserving respect; and it is what the family believes, so that this value which they attribute to the father cannot be their own state of mind in believing. Similarly, the sacredness of the soil, whatever it may be, is evidently not the same thing as the nation's belief in the sacredness of the soil. Again, if a particular community's beliefs were the final criterion of real values, it would be impossible to criticize the "accepted" values or value beliefs of that community; all ethical dialogue between communities, and all ethical progress, would then be impossible. (This is not merely a practical objection; it states a discrepancy between the theory and the facts of usage). It is possible to escape from these objections by defining value in terms of a moral emotion of approval rather than an intellectual belief. This meets with its own difficulties, but it is not neces- sary to go into them here; for this variant of the theory can lead to no conclusion about infallibility, since it is meaningless to speak of emotional attitudes as fallible or infallible (1). The valid theological objection (stated briefly above, ? 4 in connection with Shaybani) is that the definition of value, from which the theory begins, conflicts with that which is implicit in the scriptures of Islam. Two views are possible of the ethical theory implicit in the Qur'dn. (a) There is an objective good, a "natural right", which the Qur'dn and the Prophet enjoin man to follow, and to some extent reveal to him. This is the Mu'tazilite view. (b) The good is simply equivalent to the law of God as stated in (1) This is as far as we can go here in criticism of social subjectivism. Any reader who sees the difficulties raised will not need further convincing; while one who does not would need a more elaborate treatment. See the brief discussion in my Ethical value (Ann Arbor and London, 1956), pp. 29-31, and the works of W. D. Ross and others referred to in the notes there. To discuss what the truth about value is would also take us far beyond our present concern. I think the major point was seen by Tawfi in the thirteenth century: see the quotation from him above, p. 32, n. 2. 47</page><page sequence="36">GEORGES F. HOURANI scripture; God determines it by His will. This is theistic subjectivism, the prevailing view of classical Islamic juris- prudence and theology. Now neither view is reconcilable with the theory of social subjectivism, that man by his judgement makes right and wrong. It is not hard to find in the Qur'dn itself opposition to this idea. For example, "Prescribed for you is fighting, though it be hateful to you. Yet it may happen that you will hate a thing which is better for you; and it may happen that you will love a thing which is worse for you; God knows, and you know not" (ii, 212/216). ("You" here is plural, and refers to the whole community). All the verses that mention God's guidance to man surely include moral guidance, divine not human; e.g. "and God guides whomsoever He will to a straight path" (ii, 209/13), "and whomsoever God guides, he is rightly guided" (xvii, 98/97) (1). Those verses which call the Muslims "the best nation" and "a midmost nation" imply the existence of a standard of merit- independent of the "accepted values" of any nation-by which it is possible to make comparisons of value between nations. The Tradition "My Community never agrees on an error", implies by its very wording that error and truth in ethics and law, whether (a) objective or (b) God-created, correspond to something independent of the Community's opinion. If the saying is genuine, it is further evidence that Muhammad did not think in terms of values created by the Community itself. The Tradition "Whatever the Muslims see as good is good with God" etc., should probably be interpreted thus: The Muslims as a whole always see correctly what God has revealed or laid down as good. But since the Tradition might be understood in the other way, mentioned above, it would beg the question to take it as an additional piece of evidence for our view. (1) The question of the general ethical assumptions of the Qur'an is not dealt with, in the way required here, by T. Izutsu, The structure of ethical terms in the Koran (Tokyo, 1959), or by Salih Shamma', The ethical system underlying the Qur'dn (Tiibingen, 1959). 48</page><page sequence="37">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS 17 The next contribution of western thought to settling the problem of the authority of consensus consists in a new statement of the basis on which it rests by the Dutch orientalist C. Snouck Hurgronje (1857-1936), and a criticism by him of that supposed basis. He thought that the real basis of the doctrine was the consensus of the Muslim community; then he pointed out that this construction falls into a vicious circle, because the basis itself has not yet been proven a valid authority. Since Snouck also laid great emphasis on the importance of consensus as "the foundation of foundations" (1) of the whole system of Islamic law, his criticism of the basis of consensus would, if correct, completely undermine the system as he understood it. Whether he realized this momentous effect or not, his argument deserves examination both for its own interest and because of the continuing influence of his writings, especially in the West. Snouck's criticism of the basis of consensus is contained in two statements in an essay on Islamic law, published toward the end of the nineteenth century. (a) The first statement is brief and must be understood as only preliminary. It is prefaced by a mention of the need that had been felt by Muslims after the time of the Prophet for a continuing source of answers to questions about their religion, that would be as indubitable as the words of the Prophet had been to his Companions. As a result, "Just as the Catholic church, seeking a source of truth [that would be] always available, came to declare itself infallible, in the same way the Muslim community was led to declare itself raised above all error. Such a doctrine evidently rests on a petitio principii" (2). (1) &lt; Le droit musulman ,, Revue de l'Hisloire des Religions, 37 (Paris, 1898), reprinted in (Euvres choisies - Selected works, ed. G.-H. Bousquet and J. Schacht (Leiden, 1957), p. 289. Similar statements on pp. 56, 225-27, etc. See below in this section for quotation of his reasons and discussion. (2) (Euvres choisies, p. 226. 4 49</page><page sequence="38">GEORGES F. HOURANI Taken at its face value, the statement treats the Muslim (or Catholic) community's declaring itself infallible as part of its own "doctrine" about the basis of infallibility. This is where the doctrine is said to fall into the fallacy of petitio principii (or vicious circle), in resting consensus on the consensus of the very people concerned. Now it is certainly a fact that the Muslims have been the people to declare their own infallibility; this is natural, since they are the ones most concerned and most disposed to do so. But the doctrine does not "rest on" the fact of their declaring it. As a doctrine it can only be said to "rest on" the reasons given for it by its own adherents. Thus there is no evident vicious circle, and Snouck's criticism up to this point cannot be regarded as adequate. He probably intended it as nothing but a compressed assertion of his position, since he goes on to a more elaborate statement which does take account of the Muslin reasons. (b) Snouck knew well that many Muslim scholars had been very conscious of the necessity of avoiding a vicious circle, and in their theories had based consensus on scripture. What he tries to show next, therefore, is that according to their own teaching the proper understanding of scripture itself was based on consensus, so that, in spite of their intention to avoid a vicious circle, they involuntarily fell into one in a more complex manner than they could see. But before we come to his second statement which explains the vicious circle precisely, it will be useful to interpose another quotation which shows more broadly in what ways he thought consensus was the foundation of the whole system of Islamic law. Writing of the need for consensus in early Islam, Snouck poses a list of questions which urgently called for answers in a community that recognized a divine revelation. "What guarantee was there for later generations that there was in Arabia someone called Mohammed who for twenty-three lunar years preached in God's name? Or: Is the book at present known as the Coran really the collection of Mohammed's sayings? Have the often obscure contents of this Coran been well understood? 50</page><page sequence="39">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS Are the explanations of the sunna correct? Are the Traditions which acquaint us with the sunna authentic? Are those which are considered canonical really superior to those which have been rejected? Is the manner in which they are applied in the community sound, or must they be interpreted in quite a different way?" (1) He then mentions consensus as the authority which answers these questions. It can be admitted that in general consensus has in the past performed these important functions with regard to the textual sources. It has been the human agency which has certified the authenticity and meaning of scripture for Muslims, and thus made laws and doctrines finally official, i.e. part of the enforce- able public practice or belief of the Muslim community. In this way it has played a large role in preserving such unity as Islam has enjoyed in the world; it has been the cement (not the foundation) of the Islamic structure. It can also be admitted that its right to exercise these functions has usually been accept- ed by Islamic jurisprudence in the past. But the claim that consensus rightfully authenticates and interprets all texts, including those which are supposed to authorize consensus itself, leads at once to a vicious circle and requires to be challenged. All the questions posed by Snouck in the last quotation concern two matters: the authentication and the interpretation of Scripture (Qur'dn and Traditions). We have previously seen (? 10) how in the Middle Ages someone found a vicious circle in connection with authentication, of the form: consensus, based on Tradition, authenticated by consensus, and how Ghazali answered him by denying the last step. We have now to see how Snouck found a similar circle in connection with interpretation, and to supply an answer. The quotation which follows is what was referred to near the beginning of this section as his second, deeper statement. "It [consensus] is the fundamental axiom of dogma and law in Islam. Attempts have been made to demonstrate it by (1) (Euvres choisies, p. 226. 51</page><page sequence="40">GEORGES F. HOURANI the Qur'dn and the sunna, but it is impossible to hide the fact that this is to go round in a vicious circle. Only the infallible community can explain the sunna and Qur'dn accurately; it is then completely idle to claim to establish the infallibility of the community by the authority of the Qur'an and the sunna. Nevertheless ijmd' has its loci probantes" (1). Is it true for all cases, including the texts supporting consensus, that "only the infallible community can explain the sunna and Qur'dn accurately?" i.e. is it true according to Islamic belief? That is the crucial question that has to be settled. As a basis for an answer, let us recall that for all Muslims the Qur'dn has a definite meaning, or more than one level of meaning, which was determined by God who revealed it. There are parts whose meaning at the highest level (ta'wllahu) is understood by God alone, and which men are discouraged from trying to penetrate (iii, 5); but even in these parts the meaning is there, once for all. In the rest, it is for men to discover the meanings, insofar as their knowledge and intelligence permit, but in no sense to create them, either individually or as a community. In the Traditions, the meaning is that intended by Muham- mad, and the situation is the same except that there is little symbolism and no discouragement to full understanding. Now, many parts of these texts are addressed to individuals, and most of them are evidently meant to be understood by individuals and capable of being understood by them, sometimes with complete accuracy. These are natural assumptions which we make when we read them. So far as I know, there is no authority for the blanket statement that "only the infallible community can explain the sunna and Qur'dn accurately". Indeed, it is logically impossible, if taken in a strict sense, for a consensus is made up of the individual interpretations of mujtahids prior to it, and unless all these were accurate the consensus would not be so. But even if Snouck's statement is taken as applying only to the situation after consensus, it is still not true of all texts. (1) (Euvres choisies, p. 227. 52</page><page sequence="41">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS For three classes of texts may be distinguished. (a) Those whose meaning is clear to all individuals, so that even if there is consensus on them an individual can still penetrate them directly for himself. (b) Those on whose interpretation indi- viduals might hesitate, but which have been settled by the consensus of former mujiahids. Such, for example, are the texts attributing to God anthropomorphic qualities, which it is agreed He cannot have in a physical sense. This middle class is the active zone of consensus, (ijmd' in the technical sense), though even here competent individuals like the classical commentators may quite well interpret the meaning for them- selves, in accordance with consensus but penetrating behind it to the reasons for it. (c) There are texts on which no consen- sus has been reached, and it is for qualified individuals to judge the meanings as best as they can. To which class do the texts supporting consensus belong? Some belong to (a), for instance the Tradition "Hold fast to the Community", whose meaning is probably plain to every Muslim, as well as approved by past consensus. Some belong to (c), such as the Tradition "My Community does not agree on an error", where there are different interpretations of the extension of the Community and the range of subjects judged by it without error (see ? 3.2). Therefore consensus does not guarantee the interpretation of this most important text; and there are others in the same case, as has been seen. But no relevant text belongs to (b). Indeed no valid support for consensus could possibly be found in this class, because that would be "to base a thing on itself", as Arabic writers on the subject say. Since Muslim scholars have seen the fallacy so regularly, it seems strange that Snouck attributed it to them, by assuming that all the loci probantes fall in class (b). Apparently he thought the entire interpretation of Islamic scripture had been fixed by consensus, so that a Muslim of later ages was bound hand and foot to it and could not move a step without it. This has never been wholly true even in the most conservative periods. Possi- bly his emphatic declarations that consensus is "the foundation of foundations" of Islamic law inhibited him from admitting that the doctrine of consensus itself had a solid foundation in 53</page><page sequence="42">GEORGES F. HOURANI scripture. That for him would have been circular, because he could not see that a scripture could have any meaning but that put into it by an interpretation governed by consensus. The difficulty vanishes when we see scripture as the believer does, as a book with God-given meanings, allowing for more or less * objective or a correct. interpretations. The texts on which the authority of consensus rests are thus regarded as having a true interpretation which supports it in fact, and it is held that this interpretation can be seen-or rather cannot avoid being seen-by any fair-minded, normally intelligent and sufficiently educated individual. Consensus is therefore like a medieval sultan, wielding great executive power in fact, but one which is theoretically delegated by a caliph as the primary source of authority. Whatever the importance of consensus in the classical system, Snouck's conception of it as the theoretical foundation of the system pays a high price in philosophical and theological difficulties. For this conception allows only two alternatives, both of which have now been seen as untenable. Either consensus rests on another consensus of the same kind, leading to the petitio principii which he has pointed out. Or consensus is itself an ultimate foundation carrying its own authority. This makes it like the tortoise on which stands the elephant, on which the world rests: the pile falls into space, because consensus by itself has no authority to support anything else. Why this is so has been explained in the preceding section (? 16) where it was maintained that the consensus of the community does not by definition create values, either in fact or according to the Qur'dn. 18 Other orientalists have not followed Snouck in his provo- cative argument concerning the basis of consensus. Their own statements on this point have sometimes been lacking in clarity or decisiveness. Ignaz Goldziher (1850-1921), after quoting the main Tradition and Qur'dn iv. 115, adds : "Other theologians regarded the validity of ijmd' as a postulate (Postulat) of sound human understanding, and made no effort to 54</page><page sequence="43">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS search for written proofs of it" (1). The meaning of this "postu- late" is not further explained, and no references are given. David Santillana (1855-1921) says of consensus that "it is founded on a kind of diffused inspiration, by which the commun- ity of believers never loses contact with the Truth, i.e. God" (2). This is more like a formulation of what consensus is than of what it is founded on. He also refers to the textual bases in Qur'dn and Traditions. The truest statement is a simple one by Louis Gardet. After mentioning the historical origin of the doctrine in the practical needs of the community, he writes: "From the point of view of Islam, however, a politico-religious conception could not be fully legitimate without a scriptural basis" (S). Where Snouck has been very influential on later scholars is in bringing them to full awareness of the important functions of authentication and interpretation performed by consensus and, less fortunately, in leading them into ambiguous claims of fundamentality. Two quotations will illustrate the trend (4). (a) Gotthelf Bergstrasser (1886-1933): "These four roots (usul) are disparate: two sources, one method and one court of appeal (Instanz). Herewith it is admitted that the last [consensus] is the really decisive one, guaranteeing the authenticity of the other two and determining their interpretation (just as in the Catholic church the authority of the church comes historically after the Bible, but systematically before it, since it gua- rantees its divinity and establishes its interpretation in a binding way)" (6) (b) Sir Hamilton Gibb: "Indeed, on a strict logical analysis it is obvious that ijma' underlies the whole imposing structure and alone gives it (1) Die Zdhiriten (Leipzig, 1884), p. 33, n. 1.

For it is iimd' in the first place which guarantees the authenticity of the text of the Koran and of the Traditions. It is iimd' which determines how the words of their texts are to be pronounced and what they mean", etc. (1) Both statements are illuminating and valid if understood aright. But after the analysis of Snouck presented above it will not be necessary to explain how such words as "decisive", "guaran- tees", "determines", "underlies" and "gives validity" must be qualified if they are not to give wrong ideas of the basic relations of consensus and scripture. The over-emphasis by orientalists on consensus in general has not gone without protest from Muslim scholars. Muhammad Abi Zahra in particular has criticized six points, including the claim that consensus has priority over scripture (2). His remarks have provided a lively stimulus to the writing of this article, for they have made apparent the wide divergence bet- ween what orientalists and Muslims have been thinking on the theory of classical consensus. 19 We have explored some blind alleys, not (it is hoped) without profit to the general understanding of the subject. Next we shall follow the path of the orientalists in a more valid direction: their criticism of the authenticity of Traditions attributed to the Prophet. Since the main weight of proof for consensus has always been placed by Muslim scholars on the Prophetic Tra- ditions which assert plainly the infallibility of the Community, well-founded criticism of the claim that these Traditions spring from the Prophet is a serious matter. In his classic Muhammedanische Studien (3), Goldziher raised doubts about the whole corpus of Traditions, applying modern methods of historical source analysis to show how most of them must have arisen in late Umayyad and early 'Abbasid times. (1) Mohammedanism (Oxford, 1949), p. 96. (2) Abu Hanpfa, pp. 321-23. (3) II, pp. 1-274, "Ueber die Entwicklung des HadIth". 56</page><page sequence="45">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS His conclusions have been accepted by western scholars, and, as Schacht has written, "This brilliant discovery became the corner- stone of all serious investigation of early Muhammadan law and jurisprudence..." (1) Schacht has followed with a more intensive investigation of legal Traditions, in Origins of Muhammadan jurisprudence, and has confirmed Goldziher's conclusions for that particular class. The Traditions on the freedom of the whole Community from error have not escaped criticism, and we have seen above the unavoidable inference from the silence of Shafi' with regard to them: that he either did not know them or did not accept them, since if he had he would certainly have quoted them as the best possible support for consensus. This argument applies to all forms of the Tradition having the same meaning; and it throws grave doubt on the authenticity of the Traditions, since a Tradition on such a vital subject not known to Shafi'i is under suspicion of having been created later. But further, since both the Mu'tazila and Shafi'i give the idea of the main Tradition in almost the very words used in it (see ? 4) we are led to see the genesis of the Tradition out of the previously circulating idea. In other words, if the record of the idea precedes the record of the Tradition, there is a suspicion that the Tradition arose after the idea and in order to substan- tiate it. This argument by itself is not conclusive, for we can never be sure of a post hoc, ergo propler hoc, and it is always possible that a genuine Tradition existed unknown to Shafi'i. But the argument is circumstantially strong, in combination with other facts. One such fact is that the Tradition was disputed in the time of Nazzam (d. 835-45), just the time when a new Tradition might have arisen as a result of the impetus given by Shafi'i and his school (2). (1) Origins, p. 4. (2) Ghazali, Mustasfa, I, 112. It is true that Ghaz5li says the Traditions were never denied before the time of Nazzam. But as he is relying on the traditional isnad evidence, which modern scholarship has found good reason to question, we are justified in disregarding his statement about early Islam, and attaching greater weight to his testimony that the Traditions were denied in the time of Na;a;m - a period which he knew better through its literary remains. 57</page><page sequence="46">GEORGES F. HOURANI Another ground for suspicion lies in the use of the phrase "my Community" (ummali) in all these Traditions. Did the historical Muhammad ever refer to the Muslims in these terms? The phrase seems altogether more possessive and Messianic than anything to be found in the Qur'dn, which never describes the Muslims to Muhammad as "your Community", or in the Cove- nant of Madina (1). Again, the assertion that the Muslim Community of all future times would never commit a unanimous error seems far to exceed anything that a man could normally know, and such a claim does not accord with the real Muhammad's humility and his awareness of his human limits, as they appear to us from the Qur'dn. From the very fact that this claim is made in a Tradition, we know that it is not attributed to Muhammad's revealed knowledge, but is supposed to be a part of his merely human knowledge. With all his wisdom, how on earth could he know such a thing? It is true that the Tradition appears in a more elaborate variant, "I begged God the Exalted that my Community might never be united on an error, and He granted it to me," (2) and this version seems made to order to answer the objection, by bringing in an element of revelation. But, once our critical judgement of Traditions is aroused, it is precisely such a feature which leads us to think it was made to order, literally, for exactly this purpose. Thus it appears merely as a later stage in the life-cycle of this cluster of Traditions. Finally, we have seen that the Qur'dn contains no clear text on the infallibility of the Muslim Community, as Muslim scholars have often admitted. But if this doctrine had been intended originally as a part of Islam, and one which would inevitably have the most far-reaching effects on its religious law, is it likely that it would have been left to the Prophet to state in Tradition, and never once proclaimed in the Qur'dn as a part of the revealed religion? If the answer is No, as is reasonable, it (1) Ibn Ishaq, Sira, ed. F. VWustenfeld, Das Leben Muhammed's nach Muhammed b. Ishdk (G6ttingen, 1858-60), pp. 341-44; tr. A. Guillaume, The life of Muhammad (Oxford, 1955), pp. 231-33. (2) Quoted by Ghazali, Muslasfa, I, 111. 58</page><page sequence="47">THE AUTHORITY OF CONSENSUS must be concluded that it is unlikely that the doctrine is part of original Islam, and that the Tradition is not genuine. Now, since every form of the Tradition is subject to one or more of these objections, it is no use saying that the sum total of them guarantees that the Prophet really spoke of infallibility, though the words are uncertain. For a sum of weaknesses is weak, not strong. Up to the present, the fundamental researches of Goldziher and Schacht on the Traditions of Islam have had little impact on the thinking and writing of Muslim scholars. There is thus once more a great gap between the attitudes of western and Muslim scholars, the one party not counting the Traditions "Muhammadan", the other still quoting them as authorities for sharr'a law, without considering the grave doubts that have been cast upon them. 20 This article has led to two major conclusions. (a) Any sound basis for the authority of an infallible, cumulat- ive consensus, as a definite institution of Islam, must be found in a text of Islamic scripture. On this principle the medieval Muslim scholars were right. (b) No such basis can be found in the Qur'dn, or in any Tradi- tion that can be regarded with confidence as authentic. This is what modern scholarship leads us to think. Using these two conclusions as premisses, we arrive at a third: that there is no sound basis for the traditional doctrine of consensus in Islam. This last conclusion is not at all disastrous for the religion of Islam, either as a system of belief-so long as it continues to be solidly based on the Qur'an, at least-or as a system of practice, where traditional consensus was only a barrier to modern change. Indeed, it is now nearly a century since Muhammad 'Abduh started to break away from laqlTd, and in the meanwhile the Muslim peoples have done very well without such a restraint. But they have not until now found a sufficient theoretical</page><page sequence="48">GEORGES F. HOURANI justification for ignoring past consensus. Perhaps the present study will be helpful in that direction, the more so as it has not been written with any practical purpose in mind or any fore- knowledge of what conclusions would be reached. It has occurred to some Muslim thinkers, such as Kemal Faruki, to consider a revocable consensus one of the principles of Islamic law. This sounds more reasonable, and we have looked with respect at Faruki's argument for it. Still, this consensus remains infallible within its limits of time and space, for Faruki accepts the Tradition as authentic. Now even this must be abandoned if the Tradition is not authentic. All that remains possible, then, is a consensus that is revocable and fallible. But this should provide quite enough authority for the needs of the religious community. The Qur'dn, as has been seen, does contain positive injunctions to Muslims to main- tain solidarity, to stick together in following the path of Islam. The fulfilment of these injunctions can be carried out by the worldwide Muslim community in any way it sees fit, in accord- ance with its vision of its religious interests and obligations. In pursuing these ends, Muslims can accept what they find beneficial from the institutions of the past, or create new insti- tutions, such as ecumenial councils of religious leaders. What- ever is generally agreed upon will surely constitute an effective unifying consensus until it is revised, but there will be no need to think that Muhammad made it irrevocable or infallible.
