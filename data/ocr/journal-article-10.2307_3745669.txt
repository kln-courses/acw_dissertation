Mr. Longwell contends that what is known as the Middle Ages was no mere barbaric interregnum between ancient and modern history, but actually an earlier stage in the development of this Western civilization to which we belong. It was characterized by a genius for Religion comparable to the scientific genius of modern times. He emphasizes the continuity of tradition from Greek philosophy throughout the patristic writers to the mediaeval scholastics, whose thought is profound and interesting, particularly to us who are, in an important sense, their racial and cultural descendants. Their neglect, which is undeserved and to be deplored, is attributed to the exag? gerated reaction of Renascence thinkers from the immediate past, but the writer is confident that the unconscious debt of modern to mediaeval phi? losophy will become increasingly apparent. Mr. Sanborn suggests that much conflict between divergent schools of psychology would be avoided if psychologists remembered that every science is dependent upon philosophy for the interpretation and evaluation of its results. Science, being a descriptive classification of phenomena (so univer- salized that the idiosyncrasies of the individual observer are eliminated), may, like the common sense from which it is developed, legitimately describe in terms of purpose no less than of causality. Indeed, all evolutionary theories contain an anthropomorphic element. He criticizes extreme Be? haviourism as emptying psychology of its distinctive subject-matter. For when Physics is becoming less materialistic, why should Psychology become more so ? Yet he would not banish all idea of causality from psychology, and welcomes the non-introspective observation of mental process, especially if interpreted emphatically. Most of all he advocates the functional method, 267</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES which accounts mental processes normal only when manifesting a selective expectancy in accordance with the purposive trend of the personality. Mr. Gamertsfelder maintains that the subject-matter of philosophy and the conditions of all philosophizing prelude any impartiality comparable with that of the specialized scientist. It is not that the historical division of philosophers into schools (representing broadly the formal or rational and the realistic, empirical attitudes) is altogether insuperable, but rather that the whole of our many-sided nature is exhibited in our thinking. Each individual philosopher is inevitably influenced by accidents of his psycho-physical endowment and of his personal history. His private frustrations and special- izations, and the continual changes within his cultural environment, must qualify his balance and disinterestedness. Civilization is engaged simul? taneously both in exploring the radical aims of human nature and in satisfying its immediate wants. In all progress, whether of the individual or of society, much of what is being superseded, both in thought and in conduct, always persists relatively unassimilated to what is new. * The search for truth itself implies a sense of want, which indeed is the only criterion of success and failure in attainment. It is in the sphere of interpretation and values that disinterestedness is most subject to the distortions and limitations mentioned. Perfect knowledge of truth is impossible to a finite mind.</page></plain_text>
