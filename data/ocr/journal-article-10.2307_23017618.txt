Modernity conflates the question of the individual subject with the question of the nation-state's "machine of power"; thus modern performance's struggle to find appropriate modes of representing the subject is inherently political. Contemporary Yoriiba oriki performance creates and explains alternative representational modes, conceptions of subjectivity, and related conceptions of nation and politics. Orfld poems each have their own consistent but unique form designed to extol the quali ties of a specific individual, family, town, compound, animal, object, or deity.1 Aside from the demand that the specific poetry of a given oriki remain consistent, these poems are defined functionally, as poems that praise and describe something, rather than structurally. Oriki exist first as a ubiquitous oral medium, with any textual versions written for recording purposes only, and the variety of different performance contexts for this oral medium provide a rich theoretical field in which to explore the relationship between the Yoriiba subject and the Nigerian nation. While my focus is on the performance contexts of oriki—in relationship to the question of the nation—and not the poetry that is performed, it is still useful to provide a complete exam ple, in this an oriki praising the Adedeji family from Eruwa: Olato odo geg# w$ I6mi Igbomoni ota omo afi ed&amp; ja awo omu olon[onuoloun] Awon maa n seju abo olohun fa tip£tipa kl f &lt;?ra fS awQn Oko mi, bi olohun kd tetfe sun, w$n a p6 6hin-kule[apelenin-kule] Re titi aya alSya ni w&lt;Jn maa 50 kiri. (1olato odo child who dresses well at the river Igbomoni ota child that fights with sharp words. Those [the members of the house] who covet will not give up on the things you own. The owner is crying and the enemy is dragging things away. My husband, if the owner refuses to sleep on time, they will be at his backyard to find his wife.)2 In terms of oriki that describe families, this is slightly shorter than average, but it demonstrates the salient features of an oriki. It addresses the family directly and calls attention to certain characteristic traits: in this case the overdressing at the river, a verbal fluency and combative ness, and a sexually acquisitive nature. The language of oriki is highly poetic and idiosyncratic.3 1. Joel Adedeji (1969) is credited as being the first to attempt to describe a classificatory system for all types of Yoruba performance, including oriki. Given that three libraries worldwide own this manuscript, this classificatory system, which has formed the basis for a good deal of research to follow, is often filtered through a second gener ation of scholars, who have tended to simplify Adedeji's work. As a result, the commonly used definition of oriki in academic writing includes e$ci and ewl (fluid and improvisational praise poems and songs) without noting that Adedeji uses the word "oriki" to mean all praise poems, but then uses the word to delineate one sub-classification of praise poems: consistently worded, static poems dealing with self and place. While Adedeji's taxonomy is a necessary tool to explain the vast panoply of Yoriiba performance, it does not reflect the system employed by Yoruba people outside of the academy. For these people, oriki are only the specific and unchanging poems that deal with family, compound, and village or city. While may also be poetic in form and praise individuals, every Yoruba person I interviewed insisted they were unrelated performances. The point of this extended digression is that this paper employs the word oriki in its most specific sense and, in doing so, differs from much of the published material (including my prior work) in usage and conclusions. 2. Translated in collaboration with Olalekan Sunday Damilare. 3. As I interviewed people about their oriki, many quickly admitted that they did not understand all aspects of their poetry, and, indeed, several of the words used in other oriki proved archaic enough to be almost untranslatable. 74</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. The central drummer is the head of the group and several of the boys are his students. They played throughout the course of the festival. Gelede celebration, Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. (Photo by Glenn Odom) I witnessed this orfki being spoken and sung several times. I asked one woman from the Adedeji family to recite this orfki, which she did without hesitation in a voice and cadence indis tinguishable from her normal speaking voice. She chuckled upon completion and repeated the final two lines, explaining as she did so that she was proud of her family's heritage. Later in the same day, I heard the same orfki being sung to a crying infant by his grandmother in a small apartment. The infant quieted immediately, and I was told that young children are often calmed by their orfki. Finally, several days later, members of other families chanted this orfki as part of a Gijled£ festival—a ceremony consisting of dancers, singers, drummers, and masked figures, focusing on community and the power of female dancers to speak to this community.4 Gijlede, as I will explain in more detail, is designed to create community, and the chanting of orfki acted, in part, as an acknowledgement of those present. In these three cases, the words of the orfki recited were precisely the same, but the formal elements of the presentation differed, as did the notion of subjectivity presented in each context. Even the above transcription and translation caused some debate about which words should be elided and the degree to which the final three lines are a description or a warning. See Karin Barber's work for a more complete discussion of the idiosyncratic nature of the poetry within a given oriki (1989; 1991). 4.1 conducted interviews following G$l$d£ performances in the Yoruba language with the assistance of Olalekan Sunday Damilare in June and July of 2009 in Ibadan, Eruwa, and surrounding villages. While I did interview individuals, many of the interviews were also of entire performance troupes simultaneously. Several of the groups and individuals asked that I identify their village or family rather than their specific names. In that the relevant answers were consistent across interviews, I have included specific names only as relevant to the argument. 75</page><page sequence="4">The same words can be used to encourage fluid identity, to simultaneously normalize and efface identity, or to reinforce the static position of an individual within the community, depending upon which of the three contexts surrounds the orfki performance: (1) $ere (playful entertainment) is the performer's category for those performances that are neither ritually sig nificant nor performed on a stage, including orfki spoken, sung, or chanted by family members in their own households; (2) irubQ (sacrifice) refers to any ritually significant performance—in this case, the singing and chanting of orfki in the G£led§ festival is a primary example; and (3) itage (stage), the singing, chanting, or speaking of orfki as part of non-religious celebrations or staged events, a term used dismissively to indicate that, while the orfki was spoken, the per formance was not felicitous—it did not accomplish that which orfld performances are supposed to accomplish. The first two contexts focus on the orfki's marking of a stable identity, and the reinscription of such identity constitutes felicitous performance. The self being reinscribed by the first two performance contexts is not, precisely, a tradi tional Yoruba subject. Traditional Yoruba culture provides a nonconflictual view of the self as eternally stable yet fluid, containing a synergistic set of related synecdoches of the self. The flu idity of this traditional model of the self comes in the interaction of elements of self, but the nature of these individual elements remains stable—an idea that also pertains to the relation ship of self to nation. Aspects of this traditional view, however, were reified during colonial pro cesses, which created a rigid, static mode of subjectivity that simultaneously reinforced and effaced the concept of the individual. This new view insisted that the individual had unique qualities, but that these qualities were static.5 Contemporary Yoruba culture maintains the truth of both the precolonial and postcolonial conceptions of self in different nonoverlapping con texts, but has not merged these ideas into a unified whole. The lack of convergence can be read in many different performance media, ranging from the practice of Ite divination, which simultaneously insists upon an individual's place within the world and the ability to transcend that place, to the nonconflictual alternation of an individual's Christian worship and prac tice of traditional religion; to the omnipresent conflict over national, Pan-African, tribal, and geographic loyalties; to the performance of orfki. The contemporary Yoruba subject must nav igate between the rigidity of postcolonial subjectivity (insisting that things are "either/or") and the simultaneous fluidity and stability of traditional philosophy (which allows for a "both/and" model)—without these contrasting modes creating open conflict in identity. Olusegun Oladipo (1992) explains the two poles of the philosophical debate surrounding the emergent modes of subjectivity: the traditionalists and the modernists. The traditional ists seek to define African philosophy and subjectivity in purely indigenous terms, ignoring the imposition of colonialism. While the historical reconstruction of indigenous philosophy is an admirable task, this philosophy no longer applies to the contemporary experience. The mod ernist group of philosophers "insist that the African philosopher should take a critical cogni zance of the various strands of the African experience [...] as they seek to develop a tradition of modern African philosophy" (1992:15). In practice, this modernist African philosophy is a spe cific reworking of Western philosophy to make it relevant to the African experience. Oladipo rejects both these models and argues that a new African philosophy should grow from tradi tional philosophy, informed by colonial experience, with deliberate and self-initiated change. Orfki performance suggests precisely such a philosophical model of the subject, and, as a result, of the nation—a model that is not dependant on Western modernity nor fully circumscribed by African tradition. If the specific conflicts over the performance of subjectivity in Western modernity are directly related to the subject's place within the nation, then it is logical to ask what man ner of nation might grow from the ongoing process of Yoruba performance of identity with its 5.

I write in the subjunctive, because the Nigerian nation, with its multiple constitutions, ethnicities, military coups, and wars is in the process not only of national redefinition but also in the process of defining the concept of nation itself. To reverse the logic, it is not surprising that the various performative manifestations of the Yoruba sub ject have yet to be constructed as a unified whole, given that there is no nation to interpellate them. Examining the disparate contexts of orfki performance strongly suggests a conception of national identity that is able to incorporate traditional and contemporary notions of the sub ject into a synergistic and fluid whole. The hypothetical concept of nation that emerges from the three orfki performance contexts in question is certainly not the nation governed by the invisible hand of Adam Smith's every-man-for-himself capitalism, nor Emerson's harmonious multivocality with each individual's distinct contributions blending into a unified whole, nor Durkheim's Utopian socialism where the state and the individual have become virtually inter changeable. All these modes of considering the relative place of the individual and the nation presume a distinctively Western subjectivity—a Cartesian "I" or the modernist response to such an "I." The civil society that could emerge from Yoruba subjectivity provides a simultaneous space for the individual to be completely defined by society in a static way and for the individual to manipulate this static definition to shape the community. An examination of the performance contexts of orfki serves to clarify the precise nature of this civil federation. Three Contexts of Oriki Performance Three Notions of Identity When orfki are recited within a family or between friends, some performers call this sere.6 In addition to the singing of orfki to children, this category also includes orfki spoken between friends with the specific intention of altering the listener's behavior so that it will correspond to the values mentioned in the orfki. Although deeply rooted in communal and familial tradition, in contemporary society this context presents the most rigid idea of identity. The performers in these cases insist upon the unchanging quality of the orfki text, in con trast with Barber's claim that a person's orfki changes as "more of his or her qualities become apparent during his or her life-time" (1991:20). Orfki in this context may be spoken, sung, or chanted by any member of society at any time with no required framing devices. I actu ally heard several orfki being spoken in this context and was only retroactively aware that what had been said was an orfki—particularly since poetic flourishes adorn everyday speech in Yoruba culture. The mundane nature of orfki performed in a context of ser§ does not decrease the efficacy of the communication. Orfki, when performed in this way, create what appears to the Western mind to be a conflict in temporality with regard to the ability of the speaker to affect the per son to whom the orfki refers. The performers claim that orfki have been unchanged since their inception and are an accurate reflection of what was, what is, and what will be. However, one of the purposes of recitation in this context is to alter the behavior of the listener so that it will correspond to the eternal mode of behavior described in the orfki. Of course, if the listener's behavior could be altered by the orfki, then the behavior must not be in keeping with it, and this calls into question the eternal nature of the family described. When pressed about the par adox of altering someone's behavior so that it can match an eternal, accurate, and ideal descrip tion of the behavior, the people I interviewed responded, unanimously, that the question was foolish because someone would always be around to perform the orfki, and that the orfki would only bring about qualities that were already there in any case. Temporary behavioral aberrations 6. It should be noted that while all those I interviewed agreed about the distinction between itage and irubQ, I was not given a consistent answer as to what label to place on performances that were part of neither of these catego ries. Thus, while the above distinctions between ori'ki use are certainly present, the labels I put on these categories, specifically "§er?" should be read as an academic convenience and not as a wholly indigenous creation. 77</page><page sequence="6">were no obstacle to a permanent identity. My interviewees, particularly the Adedeji house hold, used this same logic to insist that there was no coercion in the use of orfki. Singing was not changing someone from whom they fundamentally were; it was just altering surface behav ior that was not central to identity. In this first context, then, orfki mark, describe, perform, and reinforce a static, externally defined notion of identity. Irubo also incorporate orfki or fragments of orfld, and, rather than being everyday commu nications that might pass by unremarked, are ritually significant communications both with the immediate audience, the ancestors, and potentially with the gods. This mode of performance, while more formally fluid than sere, presents only a marginally less rigid notion of identity. Gelede, as one example of an Irubo performance of orfki, is danced when the community needs guidance or correction as well as on ritually significant calendar days. These ceremonies are begun with private prayer and sacrifice, followed by drumming, and then dancing both by the members of the G&lt;jled6 soci ety and those who are, for the most part, in an audience role. Eventually, the orfki of a partic ular Gelede masquerade (in this context "masquerade" designates an individual combination of body, mask, and spiritual entity) is sung and the masquerade enters, dances, and then leaves the performance space. Each Gelede society has its own col lection of masks, and this limits the number of masquerades that might appear in a given perfor mance. Given that the masquer ades are iconic Yoruba figures, it is not unusual to encounter G#l§de societies in several dif ferent villages with masks carved Figure 3. A woman carrying the ceremonial staff (ide) used to open the festival. ^ same twins, G£led£ celebration, Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. (Photo by Glenn Odom) serpents, etc. Since each carv ing refers to a specific spirit, the duplication of masks is problematic, and each society claims the primacy of its particular mask over the others that may resemble it. As in the case of the G£l£d£ ceremonies I witnessed, several complete orfki may follow one another, and the speaking of a particular orfki at a particular time does not follow a predeter mined pattern. Instead, the order of events is a response to the energy generated by the spir its and the crowd. When asked whether this order was improvisational, the Gelede performers in Igboora, a village outside of Eruwa, near Ibadan, insisted that if they performed at the wrong moment, blood would come out of their mouths rather than words. One of the purposes of the Gelede ceremony, and the orfki contained within the ceremony, is to remind the town or indi viduals of their identity prior to the entrance of the spirits/masquerades, and in this way irubae reinforces the same sort of static identity as the sere recitations of orfki. Figure 3. A woman carrying the ceremonial staff (idt) used to open the festival. G£led£ celebration, Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. (Photo by Glenn Odom) In the Gelede I saw in Igboora, for instance, the masquerade chastised one of the local chiefs by reciting the chief's familial orfld and the orfki of his compound (neighborhood). Upon my arrival in the town, the chief had told me that, since he had not been informed in advance, he did not wish to allow the ritual to proceed. The performers argued with him and eventu ally convinced him to let the ritual continue, noting, in support of this decision, that they had a&gt; 3 78</page><page sequence="7">already performed the neces sary sacrifices. The chief's famil ial oriki was about respecting tradition and the orfki of his compound was about generos ity of spirit. The masquerade who appeared in the Gelede cer emony recited both these orfki, and then other singers explic itly linked the orfki to the chief's treatment of me. The chief was obviously a proud man—an attribute he had demonstrated clearly upon my arrival, and so I was convinced that being pub licly scolded with his oriki would offend him. In fact, the power of the masquerade and the strength of the notion of iden tity contained within the orfki cowed him. He apologized to me after the ceremony and then left quickly. While individual orfki per formed in this context reinforce the same type of static identity as in ?er$, the other oriki and songs that surround them can shape this meaning in a way that is not available in the §ere con text. The orfki used in irubp con Figure 4. G?l&lt;jd£ masquerade with traditional torn fabric skirt. Eruwa, Nigeria, texts are still static in form, but 3 Ju[y 2m (phm by Glenn Qdom) the relationship between sev eral static forms creates an idea of community—an interaction between forms that is explicitly a purpose of the Gelede rit ual. In this context oriki not only remind a family of their identity, but they place this identity in the broader sweep of the community. Given, however, that the ordering of orfki in this con text is governed by the spirits—that blood would come out instead of words if the order was wrong—the relationships between members of the community also seem to be relatively static, or, at the very least, externally defined. Figure 4. Gelfjde masquerade with traditional torn fabric skirt. Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. (Photo by Glenn Odom) However strong the notion of a singular, static, eternal identity contained in the orfki might be in the irubo context, the masquerades themselves suggest alternative modes of identity. While the performers were quite willing to show me the masks prior to wearing them and were even willing to be filmed donning the masks, they insisted that, once in the mask, they were the mas querade or spirit. They were not acting, nor were they possessed, which would imply a sepa ration between body and spirit not in keeping with Yoruba philosophy, but they were replaced entirely by the masquerade. These masquerades sing and perform to reemphasize the iden tities contained in the chanted orfki, while having completely effaced the identity of the per former who may, in fact, be a member of the compound or family sung about in the orfki. This is not the fluidity of identity describe in traditional Yoruba philosophy, but, instead, one static identity being subsumed by another in order to reinforce the proper identities contained in the orfki. Static identities are placed into a hierarchy, defined externally, but also subject to some * 79</page><page sequence="8">degree of change, given that one can be erased by another for the purposes of a felicitous Gelede performance. Irubo is a mechanism of power, a way of officially partic ipating in the community and, indeed, of making oneself legi ble to the community, but also a way of excluding individu als from communities. Parts of the irubo are kept secret—I was not allowed to witness a sacrifice that took place before a Gelede performance, for instance, nor were any outsid ers privileged with the orfki of certain masquerades. When an Ewe woman who was accom panying my party was asked by a performer what Yoruba town she hailed from, she became noticeably upset. In a cere mony celebrating community, she was marked as an outsider, Figure 5. Rooster-style G&lt;jled£ mask. Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. and, moreover, as someone with (Photo by Glenn Odom) out a clear definition—some one without an oriki to provide a static identity. The singer responded by reciting verses about strangers and travel: despite hav ing lived in Yorubaland her entire life, this woman did not have an oriki and could not be incor porated directly into the performance, and she felt this permanent separation keenly. Irubp then reinforce static identities through repetition and exclusion and replace one static identity with another. Finally, oriki are contained within alarinjo and other contemporary itage (stage perfor mances). Here the monolithic static identity of sere and the simultaneous effacement and rein forcement of static identity found in irubo give way to a fluid, explicitly performative notion of identity. In alarinjo theatre, performers mix acrobatics, short plays, improvised poetry, oriki, and a variety of other acts together in a vaudevillian combination designed for entertainment. In such theatre, fragments of various orfki can be improvisationally patched together and tex tually altered based on the performer's virtuosity. While irubo performances may intersperse orfki with other singing, the text of the oriki itself is static: in contrast, there is nothing static about alarinjo's use of orfki. Both Kacke Gotrick (1984) and Karin Barber focus their analyses on this mode of performance, and thus, while my overall conclusion on the relationship of orfki and identity differs due to my focus on multiple contexts, in this context, I agree with the prior scholarship. Barber says that each "item is autonomous referring to its own field of meaning and therefore capable of standing on its own," but is simultaneously connected to all other objects or people named in the performance (1991:21). Barber also says: [this performance] appears to lack closure and boundaries [...]. An orfki performance appears endlessly accommodating and incorporative [containing] not only elements drawn for the "pool" of oriki, but chunks of Ifa divination verses, proverbs, aro (cumula tive narrative poems) and even riddles [...T]here is no determinate, "authentic" text, but rather continual and fluid variations on a set of possibilities. (1989:18) Figure 5. Rooster-style Gelede mask. Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. (Photo by Glenn Odom) s o -a O § &lt;u o 80</page><page sequence="9">This accumulation, improvisation, and adaptability give the performer space to trace what is, what should be, and what could be. These orfki fragments can mark change and the performer can praise specific qualities new to the individual, despite the formal text of the family orfki. Since most everything in the Yoruba world has an orfki, this mode of improvisational combina tion also serves to position its listeners in human, natural, and spiritual communities. The flu idity of identity created by the novel mixing of orfki is itself a means of reconnecting the fluid individual to a community and thus establishing relationships that in turn provide a context, if not an actual definition, of the individual. Significantly, Joel Adedeji traces the root of alarinjo theatre to the 19th century, well after the emergence of the first wave of onki in the semi-mythical past of Yoruba culture and con temporary to the first wave of British colonization. As the philosophical construction of identity became more rigid, with ethnic identity, specifically, becoming reified, alarinjo recontextual ized orfki as radically fluid. Contemporary "traditional" performers dismiss this mode of perfor mance, the itage, as lacking the power of the other modes and as being outside of the structures of authority, thus it is the form that most immediately challenges the ordering of society by shifting notions of identity. Where then do these three performance contexts leave the question of the individual? In the case of irubo and sere, identity is subsumed in one of three ways: you become synonymous with your orfki, or seek to do so; you become the masquerade, leaving your own personality behind; or you become an outsider, excluded from the ritual. This is not an Althusserian hailing of the subject—the interpellation of a passive individual into a predetermined ideology—but a more active performative creation of a subject, a constant reiteration of the social, familial, and indi vidual norm. The Yoruba subject has always claimed to be fluid, and yet the fluidity of identity in the alarinjo theatre is dismissed as merely itage. Each of these three performance contexts provides different notions of identity and each makes claims to cultural authenticity and con temporary authority. Yoruba Philosophy and Identity So, is the modern Yoruba self to be located in itage, the pastiche of theatrical forms that devel oped in the 19th century, with its fluid identity? In the recognition that subjects are part of sys tems and therefore subject to these systems found in ser§ recitations of orfki? In the blatant simultaneity of subjugation and resurgence of the subject found in the irubo? It is my conten tion that there is potential for the harmonious coexistence of these three distinct modes of iden tity, just as the traditional Yoruba view of self contains a number of harmonious, overlapping, unique, and synergistic parts.7 7. The idea that Africa has found its own modernities or alternatives to modernity is well-trod theoretical ground. Adeshina Afolayan (2008) provides a reasonable overview of these debates as related to Yoruba culture. I agree with Afolayan's conclusion that African modernity and postmodernity are formed dually by responses to tradi tional African philosophy and imported Western philosophy. In any case, the Yoruba culture certainly has grap pled, and continues to grapple with the place of the subject in the nation, in time, and in space—questions that are fundamental to Western modernity. Given that the distinction between modernity and postmodernity are contested territory even in Western academics, it is not surprising that in the African context, with the addi tional cultural influences shaping these movements, that postmodernity and modernity collapse into one another. Yoruba modernity, specifically, as Afolayan points out, never reached a stable formulation and, in its repeated question, was always already postmodern. This use of postmodernity to explain the Yoruba situation, however, is problematic. While there are a number of postmodern theories that account for the simultaneous existence of dis tinct but connected modes of being, these emerge from the centered discourse of the Enlightenment and moder nity's responses to this. Given that historical Yoruba philosophy did not contain the monolithic totality of the Enlightenment, Yoruba modernity, while potentially formally similar to ideas of pastiche, is rooted in a project distant from that of the postmodernists. 81</page><page sequence="10">Rather than conflicting, the divisions of the traditional Yoruba self function as synergis tic synecdoches of the subject in the communal space. In The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful: Discourse about Values in Yoruba Culture (2000), Barry Hallen concludes that the Yoruba view of self is complete in its very dismemberment. Any of the constitutive parts of the self (i.e., Iwa [character], inu [conscious self], okan [mind], etc.) may stand in for the whole self: the parts also maintain their identity as individual pieces and the whole maintains an identity separate from its parts. Furthermore, the relationship between whole and part is unstable. These sections of self, or different selves, serve neither the regulatory functions of the tripartite system of self derived from psychoanalysis, nor do they collapse into a single concept expressed by many words. They are at once parts of the self and the self itself. The Yoruba language cannot support a wholly unambiguous discourse on self because the self is traditionally conceived of as fluid and dependant on the communal concept. The individ ual itself is composed of semidiscrete, harmonious aspects—a community of identities—and this community exists only in the gaze of the larger community. Individual fluidity, then, is not at odds with a socially normative understanding of the self within the community. In fact Segun Gbadegesin argues that the self's "existence and personality are dependent on the community" and thus the individual is expected to "contribute to the continued existence of the commu nity" (2003:191). In traditional Yoruba philosophy, community—within the self and between selves—provides a stable framework in which a fluid self can develop. As noted above, this philosophy became more static after colonization, with a greater insis tence on the stability of the various portions of the individual. The autobiographies of the first wave of postcolonial Nigerian Yoruba political leaders (Awo by Chief Obafemi Awolowo, for instance [I960]) display a pronounced move toward a Cartesian notion of self, with remnants of traditional philosophy.8 A scan of the editorial pages of Yoruba papers reveals repeated laments over the failure of the individual to influence the community, the attempts of individuals to exert too much control over communities, the lack of strong leaders, and other articles implic itly trying to relocate a concept of the self appropriate for Nigeria.9 The traditional notions of self exist side by side with Western selves, and hybrid selves. The subject that emerges from the combination of the various performance contexts of orfki is not precisely synonymous with traditional philosophy or with the contemporary revisions of 8. For example, Chief Obafemi Awolowo says that When Nigeria becomes a self-governing nation [...] it will have made history. Her road to freedom has been strewn with a large assortment of verbal diatribes from Nigerian nationalists, and unnumbered admin istrative blunders on the part of our British overlord [...0]ur denunciations and invectives against British imperialism over the years have broken none [no bones...] if the British rule had been less inept than it was, the opportunity for Nigerians to demonstrate that they are quite qualified to manage their own affairs would have been correspondingly reduced. (1960) The "our" signals the collective "Nigerians" who can possess something as a group. The "we" of this group, how ever, is also the "they" who are capable of handling "their" own affairs. The "they" separates the "we" from the author. Furthermore, while the "Nigerians" are clearly not British and not diatribe-spewing "nationalists," their actual identity is not clear. Nigeria is an "it" and a "her." Nigeria thus is singular encompassing a collective, which, in turn, both contains and excludes the author of the autobiography. Earlier, Awolowo used "I" and, to make sure the reader remains interpellated within Nigerian history, even a "you." After this brief tangle of pro nouns, there is no "you" and there is no explicit "I," so the reader is left: to position self, nation, and author amid the various possible pronoun positions. 9. In The Guardian, 10 September 2009, an editorial obituary laments the fact that a doctor, while an impressive figure, failed to make a lasting change on the medical profession, an editorial in support of certain types of armed insurrections, and an editorial calling for greater individual responsibility in the banking industry. The fourth edi torial does not raise the question of the individual role within the community, but the overlapping concerns of the other three, and the prevalence of these concerns throughout the paper, suggests that the definition of self is not entirely stable territory. 3</page><page sequence="11">this philosophy. IrubQ and ?er$ performances of oriki provide the stabilizing normative function, whereas the itage provides the fluidity. The Political and Performance To return to the connection between nation and self, Nigerian citizens are struggling to define Nigeria even as their models of identity shift—without a clear means of representing the sub ject, it is not surprising that representing and defining the nation has proved a challenge too great for the more than a dozen men who have been head of Nigeria's state since indepen dence. Western theories postu late the nation as a construction of individual subjects and explain both the creation of the nation by the subject and the creation of the subject by the nation (i.e., Althusser's hailed subject, Marx's worker, Kant's Tierra del Fuegians, Benedict Anderson's imagined communities). Paul Gilroy opens Black Atlantic by defining double consciousness: I do not mean to suggest that Figure 6. The masquerades that are dancing are samples of hundreds of different taking on either or both of common mask types, often depicting something from nature. Gelfede celebration, these unfinished identities Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. (Photo by Glenn Odom) necessarily exhausts the sub jective resources of any particular individual. However, where racist, nationalist, or ethni cally absolutist discourses orchestrate political relationships so that these identities appear to be mutually exclusive, occupying the space between them or trying to demonstrate their continuity has been viewed as a provocative and even oppositional act of political insubordination. (1993:1) Figure 6. The masquerades that are dancing are samples of hundreds of different common mask types, often depicting something from nature. Gelede celebration, Eruwa, Nigeria, 3 July 2009. (Photo by Glenn Odom) Recognizing fully that Afro-Britishness and Africanness have different significations, I none theless agree with his conclusion that the formation of identity is a politically charged perfor mance. This is doubly true when it involves transactions with static binaries, as is the case in Yoruba tradition where contradictory ideas are regularly reconciled. Unlike Gilroy's multiple absolutist discourses, the Yoruba context presents a fluid discourse of identity (itage), an absolut ist discourse of identity (sere and irubp), and the potential to find a way for these to coexist. Toyin Falola articulates the extremity to which members of the community take the idea of a static identity: "one is first a Yoruba, and second a Nigerian. Until the order of citizenship is rearranged [...] it is harder to diminish the sense of consciousness that is already inverted in the creation and maintenance of the ideology of the Yoruba nation" (2006:46). Falola recognizes that, in practice, there is not a unified Yoruba nation any more than Nigeria itself is a unified nation. In the case of Yoruba identity, however, the fiction has proved "lucrative" for the polit ical elite's interests, and thus the idea of a Yoruba nation persists (2006:46). Like irubp and sere performances of orfki, those in power inflict their notion of identity upon a willing group who believe they have always had this identity. hj n&gt; £ 83</page><page sequence="12">While itage performances of orfki might suggest an alternative to this absolutist model of a Yoruba nation, Eghosa E. Osaghae argues that "there can be no substitute for [the nation's] role as the established reference point of identity for citizens in the world system and the only insti tution with sovereign power to act authoritatively to ensure peace, order, stability, and develop ment within a given territory" (2003:517). He does moderate this statement with the idea that civil society and community must find a way to communicate themselves to the nation-state, but, nonetheless, he stridently denies the suggestions of "critical members of the international donor community" that alternative conceptions of nationhood might exist. In contrast, in On the Postcolony, Achille Mbembe articulates the issue of the African nation, and a potential departure from the concept of nation this way: African regimes have not invented what they know of governments from scratch. Their knowledge is the product of several cultures, heritages, and traditions of which the fea tures have become entangled over time, to the point where something has emerged that has the look of "custom" without being reducible to it, and partakes of "modernity" with out being wholly included in it. (2001:25) Obviously there were alternative modes of government before colonialism, but the connection between individual and nation, at this level, goes beyond specific governmental formation. What, then, is the specific nature of the "nation" suggested by orfki performance? In itage recitations of onki, the self is distinctly related to other people, places, and deities. Identity is performed as a relational matter, with both community and individual shaping and being shaped. In $er? recitations of orfki, individuals are reminded of the static, unified characteris tics they possess. Irubo performances of orfki remind the individual that such a static identity is related to the community, but also subject to a higher power. The model of "nation" sug gested by individual performances is a federation of civil societies, each with their own individ ual rules, just as the conception of self contains many disparate, but unified elements. Given the more than 250 ethnic groups that comprise Nigeria, there might be a number of such societ ies. Individuals within these communities will be bound by the rules and shaped by the commu nities, but, on a local level, they will have the opportunity to shape their communities, which, in turn, shape the federation. As suggested by the irubo mode of identity, there must be a strong central force that can intervene in moments of crisis or conflict, but this is a force that must be invoked and summoned, not an omnipresent universal set of rules. Osaghae argues that it is only through the relationship of the individual to civil society and civil society to the state that a new African idea of nation will emerge (2003:518). Civil society in this context refers not just to the councils, schools, churches, and nongovernmental organiza tions of subjects, nor to groupings of individual ethnicities, but to a particular way of conceptu alizing identity as simultaneously individual and collective. Each distinct individual, in keeping with sere performance, has an identity that has been shaped by the community. This identity, however, in keeping with irubo performance, can be effaced for the greater good. The fluidity of itage, then, enters in at the level of community. While the identity of individuals within civil society is somewhat fixed, the relationship between individuals and portions of society is fluid. An individual may belong to several societies, and several societies may overlap in interests and in memberships. The ability of ancient orfki and itage to incorporate new events when prais ing the individual is a vital component of the construction of civil society: the assumption that actions can change the nature of the individual and the community provides political impetus. Shifting fully to the itage mode with its constant fluidity and incorporation would prevent the formation of a stable enough nation to be worth effacing individual identity for. As orfki performance and notions of identity continue to shift, perhaps something of Mbembe's new modernity will emerge. I close here not because this is a definitive answer, but because I leave performances in Nigeria with a consistent sense of an unfulfilled desire for something beyond the realm of immediate articulation: in the case of orild performance 0 84</page><page sequence="13">this is something simultaneously metaphysical, communal, individual, political, and physical. It might be fanciful on my part to assume that this is a desire to represent the Yoruba moder nity and nation that might have been, but there is certainly an articulated desire to perform into being, one individual at a time, this new Nigeria. This Nigeria is a place for which the models of development enhance the resurgence of traditional notions of the subject, which, themselves, are in a productive dialogue with the implicit cosmopolitanism of the modern Nigerian subject. It is a Nigeria where the diversity of philosophies and histories doesn't mark a center and an outside, but a synergistic whole—beyond pastiche, beyond multiple centers, beyond difference, into something entirely new, distinctly Nigerian.
