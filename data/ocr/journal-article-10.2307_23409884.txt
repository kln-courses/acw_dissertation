<plain_text><page sequence="1">MacCluer Gulf Tobias Schneebaum Artist, Author, Lecturer, New York Two PAPERS were the basis of my interest in going to MacCluer Gulf, at the far western end of Irian Jaya: Nieuw-Guineesche Oerkunst by G. L. Tichelman and W. Jos. de Gruyter (1944), and The Rock Paintings of the MacCluer Bav bv losenh Rôder (1956). Subsequently, I read Roder's (1939) earlier piece, Rock-pictures and Prehistoric Times in Dutch New Lruinea. INot much else had been written on this area, and few travelers have been there.

The photographs of the sites and the drawings in these articles had intrigued me for many years, par ticularly since it wasn't far from Asmat, where I had worked and continue to visit. Finally, in the fall of 1993, Zegrahm Expeditions, for whom I lecture on the îspice islander, an Indonesian cruise ship, agreed to sponsor a trip there after seeing Xerox copies of the articles. Two other members of the ships staff accompanied me. We disembarked from the ship near Timika and flew up to Biak for the night. Early morning saw us on a Twin-Otter to Manokwari and then down to Fakfak, where we stayed the night and made arrange ments for the trip to MacCluer Gulf, now called Teluk Berau. We chartered a small speedboat and spent eight hours the next day getting to Kokas, within the Gulf itself, where we were put up by the very hospitable District Officer and his family. We picked up a guide there who accompanied us for the next four days, in addition to another guide who was a Baham, one of the Papuans living in the hills above the Gulf. The people along the coast are a mixture of sev eral Indonesian peoples. Many had come in recent years through migrations from Sulawesi and the Moluccas. Some had intermarried with the indige nous Babo, Baham and Onim. All those we saw were Islamic, although there were many Catholics and Protestants in Fakfak living among the Muslims. The Christians for the most part appeared to be trib al peoples. Wherever we went, people were aston ishingly hospitable. It was obvious that not many travelers had been there. We went from Kokas to Goras, stopping along the way at dozens of rock outcroppings which were variously painted. The islands projected from the sea like mushrooms with dense growth on top, most without paint on them. The vertical limestone walls were white, in sharp contrast to the bright red or the paintings. The sea had undercut the islands, so that they were narrower at the bottom than at the top. Figure I.

There were offerings to the spirits of the sea near Fiur, a piece of cloth tied around a rattan ring, hang ing from a cliff, sandals, cigarettes, a plate, and a shell. I had seen this same concept in Misool and in Waigeo, off the western coast of Irian Jaya, offerings or wnaie Dones, torn tennis snoes, ana empty pacKs of cigarettes. There were hand silhouettes everywhere; it was the one image to be seen on all the painted rocks. There were hundreds of them. We saw these remark able scenes over and over as we went on. the motifs repeated, with occasional new signs, many touched with the white of kaolinite clay or black from char coal. There were drawings of anthropomorphic ani mais, lizards, mythological hgures, and symbols in circles, some of which might have been the rays of the sun. We saw only one carving, a wooden male figure of Matutua, the most important spirit of the region (Fie.i). It was hidden deep within a cleft in a wall of rock. We came upon ledges that were small caves, with human skulls and bones, traditional burial sites of the past. In many of the cave, people had lived until some time this century. Paddles, too, and elaborate prowheads of canoes were found on the ledges, as well, symbolic of the vessels that had originally brought the people from the West; or, per haps of the ships that would be carrying their spir its to the land of the dead. The prowheads had been stolen from the beach people, the Babo, by the banam, who came down rrom the mountains to use them on their burial sites. All the sites had place names. The Baham guide said it would take a month to see all the sites, including those in the mountains. I expect to go back in the summer of 1994. References roder, Joseph 1939.
