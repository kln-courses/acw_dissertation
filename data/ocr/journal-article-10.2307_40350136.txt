<plain_text><page sequence="1">71 ]ean-Paul Sartre from The Family Idiot, Gustave Flaubert In 1862, Flaubert recalls for the Goncourts the beginnings of his liaison with Louise: "He told us the story of his coupling with Colet, initiated in a drive home in a carriage, painting himself as playing the role of someone disgusted with life, of the dark, handsome stranger, of the suicidal romantic, which so amused and cheered him that he put his face out the window from time to time to laugh at his ease" Poorly received, this con- fidence nonetheless hits its mark: it scandalizes the two bour- geois Parisians, who transcribe it that very evening without concealing their discomfort, a discomfort the two simpletons try to allay by insinuating that the narrative is faked, that Gustave invented his character after the fact: he "paints himself as playing . . " The ambiguity of the verb "to paint" implies that the man of forty, out of an affectation of cynicism, wants to believe and have it believed that in his youth he was capable of playing a double game: that of dark romanticism, à la Petrus Borei- which is in its way a destruction of the human - and that of the dark laughter which denies man even the sad privi- lege of his suffering. For us, on the contrary, having all the texts before us, the initiated "coupling" bears such an odd, singular resemblance to the "caricature" before the cathedral that Gustave in the carriage is at once Monsieur Loyal and the laughing giant. One fact is rigorously established by the correspondence.

That is not all: beginning on 6 August, he reminds her of remarks made before their first night of love: "I had warned you about it: my misery is contagious. I am contaminated! Woe to whoever touches me!" He returns to this on 11 August: "\bu tell me that I did not show myself to be like this at first; on the contrary, search your memories. I began by showing my wounds; remember everything I said at our first dinner; you even cried out: Is this how you would excuse everything? Is there no more good or evil for you?" Was Gustave playing a part? In any event, he was being played with and he knew it. For a long time the sculptor Pradier had been repeating to friends: Let him take a mistress, there's nothing like it for curing nervous afflictions. Alfred collected these remarks and passed them on to Flaubert, who, weary of his chastity, replied that he felt tempted in the flesh but that if he were to deviate in any particular from the way of life he had imposed on himself since the "attack" at Pont-1'Evèque, he would be lost. A year went by without the proposal being renewed, but "Phidias" had not abandoned his project: his choice lighted upon Louise, a beautiful, experienced woman who would know how to handle a new recruit to love. It seems unlikely that the sculptor would not have informed her of the stratagem when he saw that she was interested in the young man. She willingly undertook the affair- Gustave was hand- some, after all. So there was a siege according to the rules, but the Lovelace was not the conventional sort: she was wearing skirts. Before succumbing, the young man suspected a con- spiracy: there was a dinner at Pradier's and then another invita- tion he did not honor, afraid of an involvement and of finding himself stuck with an unwanted entanglement. Too late- he was caught. He payed a visit to Louise, who led things briskly along, as we now find them in a hotel room where Louise is in bed, "her hair spread out on [Gustave's] pillow, eyes turned up</page><page sequence="3">FLAUBERT 73 to heaven, pale, her hands clasped, babbling foolishness [to him]." An excellent and rare description of the feminine post coitum in the last years of Louis-Philippe. Eyes turned up to heaven? Foolish babbling? For God's sake, if there was a perfor- mance, Flaubert was not the only actor. That he felt bitter and uneasy about it, that he judged himself ridiculous, we shall soon demonstrate by examining a celebrated passage from Madame Bovary; in any event, we understand his resistances. First of all, the victim of seduction is himself; Louise takes him, she pulls one over on him. In a sense, this is what he wants- his partner's activities provoke waves of desire in his constitutional passivity. But she awakens in him the old ambivalence of his feelings for his mother, the all too skillful wet nurse who was too stingy with her tenderness. To be sure, Louise shows him tender- ness. Her role demands it, but Gustave is mistrustful. It was therefore in a carriage driving Louise home or taking them to the hotel that he initiated the coupling. The Muse was too expert to take the initiative openly: while he bragged, she led things briskly along but without showing her hand, and since he insisted on playing the boastful rake and the suicide, she opened her eyes wide, scandalized, misted with desire, con- tradicted him to indicate her fright, and repeated, proffering him her charming bosom: "What! Then there is no such thing as good or evil?" At this moment Gustave is convinced that they are acting out a bad comedy under the impulse of "that gallant genital organ," and that the objective of this long boring scene is to lead them to the following scene which must take place at the hotel and will inevitably be followed by Louise's monologue- foolish words, eyes turned up to heaven, idealism. It has to be this way: in 1846, when a woman of bourgeois society has just played the beast, she must then play the angel. How does he react to this? By playing the worst of devils. The more he feels she is winding her veils around him, the more he reacts by exhibiting the ashes of his deadened heart. At first out of prudence: if there is no longer either good or evil, if his "belief in nothing" is right,</page><page sequence="4">74 SARTRE then love does not exist; coitus is the only real relation between a man and a woman; if she protests, he answers her that at least as far as he is concerned, broken as he is by great misfortunes, tender attachments are forbidden him. He invites the young woman to get away from him while there is still time; he does not hesitate to borrow a few tirades from Hernani: "I bring unhappiness to everyone around me," but by adapting them to current taste: "I am contaminated." In short, he takes all possi- ble precautions to prevent Louise, after the coupling, from blackmailing him with sentiment. Everything has been set up so that he might say to her one day: "Poor child, you take your ass for your heart." But he adds to prudence - not bourgeois prudence but the neurotic fear of committing himself- a sadism of resentment: she is beginning to cling to him, this glutton, and he knows it all the better as he is beginning to cling to her. Whatever the eventual course of their long liaison, the first letters he wrote to her are clearly those of a dazzled lover. Behind the fakeries, there is sincerity in them both. And it is precisely Louise's sincerity he wants to reach in order to make her pay for her excess of seductive cunning. He cannot resist the pleasure of shocking her and trying to hurt her: go away, you will suffer, I am the dark, handsome stranger, the widower, inconsolable; my heart is dead, you will love me, per- haps, but as for me, I no longer have the power to love you. I am an old man, everything is over for me, go away! go away, then! If the two Goncourts had had the least intelligence - the least sensibility- they would have understood that this entirely negative role is not the role of the seducer but rather, to the con- trary, that it serves as an embittered defense for someone who feels himself seduced. On this still very superficial level of interpretation, it must also be noted that his vanity comes into play: Louise is older, Parisian, she knows life better than he; above all, through her numerous liaisons she has acquired an experience of people that Gustave lacks. What is his immediate ploy? The same one he later uses at Mathilde's salon: "As for life, oh I know it better than you!" Through suffering, of course.</page><page sequence="5">FLAUBERT 75 And this is how he raises himself to that cosmic totality, whose reverse he found in the ecstasies, in order to condemn the move- ments and aims of our species. The Muse's trifling, particular experience is swallowed up by this totalization of experience whose conclusion is at once a disgust with life and that supreme act, suicide, to which he has not yet had recourse but might as well have done. This said, to the extent that he truly loves Louise he must also let himself go and speak of himself sincerely. Or almost. Let us say that insofar as he is acting, it is himself he is acting. After all, in 1846 the adolescent had not entirely disappeared who had written in October 1842, in Novembre: "I was born with the desire to die." And wasn't he right to paint himself as a romantic about suicide who recalled "having often scratched off the verdigris of old coins to poison himself, tried to swallow pins, approached the attic window in order to throw himself into the street"? And who concludes: "Man loves death with a devouring love ... he does nothing but dream about it as long as he lives." And much later, in the Preface aux Dernières Chansons, when he wants to contrast his generation to the republican youth, he recalls with naive fatuousness two of his former schoolmates who voluntarily embraced death. We read that these young heroes killed themselves out of a "disgust with life," and these are the same words Gustave pronounced in th^ presence of the Goncourts; how could he, in Louise's presence, play "cynically" as a "caricature" that deep disgust, felt since childhood, which would never leave him? As for the "dark, handsome stranger" all right- the phrase is romantic, it belongs to Nerval more than to Flaubert. But what does it mean for him? That there is darkness in the depths of his soul, simul- taneously the "terrifying depths" he mentions in Novembre as well and the obscurity of an "unspeakable" secret. And hasn't he written to the Muse that after reading this work she must have guessed everything "unspeakable" that it contained? What is this secret, then? A sorrow, of course, one of those immense griefs that bring you to the summit of Mount Atlas</page><page sequence="6">76 SARTRE and shrink the universe. The droll aspect of all this is that he really put one over on the Goncourts: in Charles Demailly, their roman à clef, they say of him that he is "a man in whom some- thing was killed in his youth, an illusion, a dream, I don't know what . . ." For the two brothers to decide to paint him in these flattering colors, he must have carefully hidden the Garlón from them early in their acquaintance and instead given them a discreet glimpse of the dark, romantic stranger he wanted to be. Was he therefore fooling them? This isn't likely. We should not take him, however, to be entirely sincere: he carefully promoted his publicity, sketched with bold lines the character he wanted to be in the eyes of the Parisian men of letters; a dra- matic character, beyond despair. For Flaubert to allow the comic side of resentment to be seen he needed to be secure in his posi- tion in Paris, in the salon of the Princess, and among his peers. Even then, the despairing figure oí Novembre, discreet and tac- iturn, sometimes reappears and with no intermediary replaces the traveling salesman. Read in Novembre, 1842: "When the crowd was jostling him, a new hatred claimed his heart, he brought to it, to that crowd, the heart of a wild beast cornered in its den, the heart of a wolf." The Goncourts' Journal, 6 December 1862, twenty years later, the same day he told them about his coupling with Louise: "He protested to us that he feels no contact with the people he meets . . . that a redskin is a hundred times closer to him than all those people we see on the boulevard." A redskin, naturally: in order to compensate for the blue blood he lacked, Gustave had long since boasted of his Indian blood; certain of his maternal ancestors lived in Canada- that was good enough for him. The two brothers rejoice: they will note the same evening that Flaubert is ignoble - it's easy to see that this is what he wanted- and they are so enchanted by the idea that they stroll gaily down the boulevard in the company of the last of the Mohicans, a noble barbarian whom the sight of the French crowds plunges into a sacred fury. The noble and the ignoble: Gustave continually passes</page><page sequence="7">FLAUBERT 77 from one to the other; in him they are complementary and can even coexist. For Flaubert is primarily and fundamentally that wretched and gloomy boy, "born" without being "well-born," who has internalized as negative pride the family ambition and success. In the carriage he told Louise what he was: and of course one is nothing on this level, being is a signification that one tries to objectify for the other and, through the other's look, for oneself by means of words and actions meant to fascinate. Be that as it may, this performance will be sincere if it strains to release and firmly fix the constantly fleeing meaning of lived experience. Flaubert talks a great deal during the ride: he wants to postpone the moment of dreaded coitus and, of course, to prepare for the "coupling" by "paying court" to Louise, as was the rule at the time; it is not a question of seducing her but of showing by calculated confidences that he has as much respect for a woman he is prepared to screw as for an "honest woman." But more fundamentally, it is sexual desire that pushes him to this "seizure of speech"; communication by the Word symbol- izes penetration; in Gustave the organ is his bronze voice, which he grasps like an erect phallus. Conversely, however, and despite what he says about it, he does not regard the coitus in prepara- tion as merely the contact of two epidermises and the blind pleasure born of their friction; solitary as Gustave may be in this first moment of an already irreversible adventure, the meaning of the feared and desired penetration is communication. Chamfort's absurdity is to employ the word "contact," which applies to caresses- and not even to all- when the essential aspect of love is that a man enters entirely into a woman who receives him entirely, which supposes that in welcoming him she closes around him, contains him, and penetrates him in her turn with what Doña Prouhèze calls "the taste of me." Love is not mute, especially when it falls silent: through flesh, "taste," odors, elasticity, colors, and forms, through the texture of skin, the distribution of hair, the total but unspeakable meaning of one person is transmitted to the other. On both sides, meaning becomes a material and silent condensation of all language, of</page><page sequence="8">78 SARTRE all sentences spoken and to be spoken, of all actions taken and to be taken. The two naked bodies at this moment are equiva- lent to an infinite discourse which they promise, surpass, then render useless. Therefore, in this precoitus through the Word, Gustave must enter into Louise by means of a monologue as sincere as his organ and his organism will soon be, today or tomorrow. He is seriously playing a part: in order to paint him- self more effectively, he borrows the principle features he has marked out in the autobiographical works. Agonies, Mémoires d'unfou, Novembre, it's all there- one more reason for think- ing that he is a performer of himself, pushing sincerity as far as he can. Was he lying when he wrote his books? Was he mocking Alfred when he dedicated them to him? Was he mocking Max- ime and twenty years later the Goncourts when he loaned them the manuscript oí Novembre, of which he was so proud? What then? Someone in the carriage is laughing. Who? And at whom? And what does this laughter represent? What is its purpose? The answers to these questions are provided by another carriage, which lurches with "blinds drawn" through the streets of Rouen, sheltering the first frolics of Emma and Leon. The young clerk is no Hernani; he is still timid, but his Parisian polish gives him a certain self-assurance. Emma is not cynical but already experienced. It is her provincial snobbery that has convinced her to take the last step: Leon, opening the carriage door for her, has assured her that "it was done in Paris." And "[this] irresistible argument convinced her." Be that as it may, she had written "an interminable letter" the evening before in which she had canceled the rendezvous: "Everything was over now and for their own happiness they ought no longer to meet." Not knowing the clerk's address, she has decided to bring it to him herself at the cathedral. She has come, handed Leon the letter, then withdrawn her hand as he was about to take it, and knelt to pray in the chapel of the Virgin. All this clearly signifies that virtue is ready to succumb but not without some oratorical sparring: Leon must do his share by preaching to this convert.</page><page sequence="9">FLAUBERT 79 We already know in advance what they will say to each other - Flaubert has reported to us their conversation of the evening before. Leon said that three years earlier Emma had been for him "an incomprehensible force that captivated my life." Delighted, she cries out: "How has it happened that no one . . . ever expressed such feelings to me before?" He answered her that "ideal natures were difficult to understand"; he was often in despair thinking of the happiness they might have had if chance had allowed them to be united by indissoluble bonds. She confessed that she too dreamed of their union, then sud- denly: "I am too old . . ." He would love others. And Leon was indignant: "Not like you!" It's all there: Leon's love will remain unique because there can never be another Emma. Moreover, she is an angel, an ideal nature whose very purity is a mystery for poor human beings. To assure her of the purity of his inten- tions, the young clerk transforms his desire to make her an adultress into an inconsolable regret at not having married her. Two kindred souls made to marry, frustrated by bad luck: in short, they are already married. It is difficult to see how their discourse could go much farther; in the carriage, they can only keep repeating it by lingering over considerations of detail, over arguments which the night before they hadn't had time to develop, while hands squeeze each other, forgotten, clandes- tine, or a furtive and completely unforeseen kiss, cutting off their conversation for a moment, joins their astonished lips. This will last for the time it must, until the work of mating has been completed in each of them. But despite Leon's nascent boorishness and Emma's self-assurance in her certainty that she is in charge, they are nonetheless at least credulous, if not sin- cere. They are trying, both of them, through their poor words, through leaps of the soul that issue in commonplaces, by an effort of imagination that breaks itself against the wall of lan- guage, by an angelism that expresses their animality in spite of them, to surpass the materiality of the carnal desire and the copulation they know to be inevitable; every phrase is a vain attempt to transcend the inspiration of the "gallant genital</page><page sequence="10">80 SARTRE organ" and fly toward beauty, purity. Surpassing, transcen- dence: this is what they pretend to display once more by an elo- quence whose source they know only too well. Emma, without illusion but once more dupe to the eternal mirage, tries to "take her ass for her heart." This means that she wills herself a woman and free against the animal lust she feels her body will impose on her: whether she aspires to ennoble it by presenting it as a generous and lordly gift of her person to her faithful Leon, or aims to distract his attention and succumb by a surprise turn which will put her at the mercy of her lover without any prepa- ration on her part and will thus relieve her of all responsibility. In other words, what they both want to preserve is the imago that each makes for himself and his human dignity conceived as inner freedom, not as a system external to the self and moved by external compulsions. What facilitates their enterprise is that they are alone and already bound together by bonds of interi- ority. No one looking on, only four walls; neither of the two is an object for a third party or quite an object for the other; they take this intersubjectivity of isolated souls for their absolute being; you desire me, therefore I am; I desire you, therefore you are; it is scarcely surprising that each one is convinced of his transcendence by the faith his partner shows in him. Madame Bovary is an angel in a very real sense. What is Flaubert up to? He yields to his creatures: they have drawn the blinds so as not to be seen by anyone? That needn't be a problem, no one shall see them, not even the author. Indeed, he takes his distance; his gaze embraces all of Rouen, the port, the countryside, and along the road, along the highway, along a major thoroughfare in the vicinity he tracks the "lumbering machine" containing the two lovers; he will stick with it uninterrupted for six hours, and we will gradually trace its intinerary. This will do. Until this point the loves of Leon and Emma have prompted only a smile; they suddenly become obscene and grotesque. What trick has he played on them, the miserable wretch? Well, he has taken a man and a woman hot with desire, wholly alive, convinced of giving themselves freely to one another, and he has metamor-</page><page sequence="11">FLAUBERT 81 phosed this entwined couple into a mere carriage. The transi- tion is worked by means of an adroitly chosen commonplace: "The lumbering machine set off on its way." This line - like "the church tower struck midnight"- is so familiar that one scarcely reads it, yet it proffers an ambiguous meaning. In the following paragraph we might just as well find ourselves inside the cab, face to face with the lovers; but the subject of the statement supposes that we have remained outside, that we have seen the doors closed, the blinds drawn. Flaubert need only maintain the same subject in the lines that follow to work this impercep- tible transubstantiation: "It set off downhill. . . crossed. . . stopped. The cab resumed its course ... It went ... it dashed forward with a bound," etc. Without pushing as far as anthropomorphism, the verbs discreetly indicate human actions (it dashed forward), or at the least those proper to draught-animals (the cab trotted). This is done in such a way that finally the object becomes the subject of the story without losing its properties as object; and the former subjects them- selves become pure objects since their actions are revealed to us as the actions of the object. Still, the author takes great care to exempt the living, breathing team, the coachman, "demoral- ized and nearly weeping from thirst, from fatigue and depres- sion," and the two hacks "dripping with sweat." The lovers, their eloquence, their caresses, their coupling, have been changed into that enchanted object, a black box on four wheels, hermet- ically sealed, perfectly inert and at the same time possessed by what the coachman calls, uncomprehending, a "fury of loco- motion." Indeed, this thing has a voice: The [machine] stopped short before the statue of Pierre Corneille. "Go on," cried a voice from inside. The cab went on again, and . . . entered the station at a gallop. "No, straight on!" cried the same voice. ... It made its third stop in front of the Jardín des Plantes. "Get on, will you?" cried the voice more furiously.</page><page sequence="12">82 SARTRE In the course of the afternoon, the coachman tries several times to stop, "and at once exclamations of anger burst forth behind him." A simple but effective procedure. The coachman is presented to us as a man: he has the simple but urgent needs we Ve all felt, he would like to rest, he is hungry, he would like to take a drink at the tavern; at the same time we see him work- ing at his job, accepting without protest a trial he bears with difficulty because he must earn his living. A banal and anony- mous character, but one who offers us a reasonable and sound image of our species: he is the one who, humbly but totally, represents transcendence and surpassing. The box, by contrast, is a robot: every time the carriage stops, a furious mechanical voice issues from it, enjoining the coachman to resume his course. The repetition of the effect, like a running joke, is deliberate and meant to convince us. We know quite well, of course, what is going on inside the cab and that these reiterated injunctions are not meaningless. It is nonetheless true that seen from the outside, the "coupling" is nothing but the "fury of locomotion" which has taken hold of an inert object. We know the story: Gustave likes to represent life to himself as a brief madness of the inorganic. He was inspired by this fantasy to change two perspiring organisms, whose sexuality is nothing but pure life, into a fragment of inanimate matter whose inertia is suddenly possessed by the rage of motoricity without the means of spontaneous movement: hence the voice that me- chanically demands an impetus from the exterior, in exteriority; hence the "demoralization" of the coachman who becomes the slave of his own material. Gustave's purpose is clear: if he were to show the interior of the box and two lovers making love, Emma and Leon would have retained the same human face as the coachman. And if prudence alone had prompted him to pass over in silence the frolics the reader so easily imagines, he could have ended the chapter at the moment Leon makes Emma enter the carriage. But in this case we would have remained in a bond of interiority</page><page sequence="13">FLAUBERT 83 with the young clerk and his mistress, as close to them as we were in the cathedral and as we are in the following chapter. Gustave has described at length the meanderings of the carriage- which imparts no new information, and conse- quently answers to none of the internal requirements of the narrative- in order to provide a view of the "coupling" as the grotesque and terrifying transport of a material object- he deliberately forces us to adopt an exterior view of human rela- tions. He breaks our ties with the couple and leads us to with- draw our solidarity with their aims, to have only a glancing acquaintance with them. And certainly their bad faith is strik- ing; in the scene in the cathedral, which is intentionally "charged," Flaubert wanted to "make fun of" the follies of love. But in order to make the lovers ridiculous he needn't have perched on a roofbeam and contemplated them from above. And as for us, in order to appreciate the comic aspect of the situ- ation, we needn't have scaled the shoulders of a giant. Leon's impatience is comic: after such a long wait, he is afraid to keep still when Emma would finally abandon herself; comic as well is the show of interest la Bovary affects and the lorgnon she takes from her purse in order to look at the funerary slabs. We laugh at them, at their maneuvers, and not at the entire human race. And if we had followed them into the carriage, we would have continued to enjoy their petty hypocrisies from an even closer vantage point. This is not Gustave's purpose; their insincerity, of course, has the effect of annihilating discourse, reducing it to a string of sonorous inanities. But despite everything, the bad faith reveals their transcendence, their intentions, their aims to the same extent that it derails the one and masks the others. And it is human transcendence that the author wants to beat to the ground, it is the human project he wants to abolish, human aims he wants to reduce to an enchantment of inanimate bod- ies. For that he must distance himself, inflate himself, elevate himself: seen from above, Leon and Emma are plunged into the anonymity of matter, their names are not even pronounced any more, the carriage and its rolling motion represent copulation</page><page sequence="14">84 SARTRE in general and the human race without intermediary contem- plated from a distance by a being who can no longer compre- hend its doings and who at once situates himself outside humanity. Once dehumanized, the reader has no more than a "glancing acquaintance" with this couple- become all couples: he sums them up in this box whose joltings typify the trem- blings of the beast with two backs. As if we pretended to reduce all the orgies of the world to the movements of all mattresses simultaneously registered by an ultrasensitive seismograph, giv- ing fornication the blind and stupid nonmeaning of a natural force. In fact, Gustave goes further. A natural force is still too beautiful- coitus is neither a storm nor an earthquake nor a tidal wave. Flaubert enjoys presenting it as an implement gone mad. The carriage is a product of labor and the instrument of another kind of labor: men are objectified in it. Gustave will make love a counterfinality, not at all the absence of all aim but the destruction of a human aim by a diabolic and anonymous one, which is manifest only through its fierce determination to distort the implement incomprehensibly. The carriage is a means of transportation: people use it to get themselves from one well-defined place to another. Beginning with the moment when Leon, asked by the coachman: "Where to, Sir?" answers: "Wherever you like," the instrumentality of the carriage, that is, its rational meaning, is abolished. The first changes of place, however, preserve a trace of rationality because the coachman, left to himself, takes certain habitual routes at random: perhaps the customers want to visit the town? Perhaps they have a train to catch? Or the desire to stroll under the trees in the Jardín des Plantes? He tries; he stops in front of the statue of Corneille, at the station, in front of the main gate of the Jardin. But at every attempt the box goes into a fury behind his back; so he gives up trying to understand, and the cab, abandoned to itself, "wanders" without purpose or direction, at "random," passing and repassing through the same streets, leaving the town only to reenter it. This tool was made to take the shortest way, to con-</page><page sequence="15">FLAUBERT 85 duct the customer at the least expense to the address indicated; here it is, going nowhere, or what amounts to the same thing, it wears itself out, it wears out its coachman and his horses in dragging them along anywhere at all, demanding to go from one point to the other by the longest route. Labor is nonetheless involved: the horses are drenched with sweat, the coachman is worn out but knows he will be paid. Paid to sell out his profes- sion systematically, to obey his carriage instead of commanding it, to do in all respects the contrary of what his professional con- science orders him to do: this particularly is what demoralizes him. To the point "that he ran up against things here and there, not caring if he did." This huge, vague nonsense, this long tribulation of a vehicle, this jolting trajectory, this revolt of a tool against its worker, this abolition of practical order to the profit of a non-sense, of a disordered aberration, this hearse "shut tighter than a tomb" lurching at the rumps of two exhausted hacks, all this has only one meaning: it is love grasped in its practico-inert materiality as an absurd revolt of inanimate matter against the imprint imposed on it by human work. And also as a counterwork, in the sense one says, for example, of a piece of woodwork that it "works." Thus the two lovers, transformed into a furious vehicle, are more naked than they would be in bed since they no longer have anything to protect them. Their "coupling" is public: they are carved tomb figures gone mad; their transports are reduced to the unique character of a transport whose essence is to go from nowhere to nowhere; the energy they expend in the sexual act equals that furnished by two indifferent hacks to execute an idiotic labor. Like the coachman, disoriented, passing con- stantly by the same places, the copulation they wanted to con- ceal is transformed into an obscene exhibition: "At the harbor, in the midst of the drays and casks, and in the streets, at the corners, the good bourgeois folk opened large awestruck eyes at this sight, so extraordinary in the provinces. . .and which appeared thus constantly. . .tossing about like a vessel." Every- thing, then, is seen: the good bourgeois see the couple screw-</page><page sequence="16">86 SARTRE ing, they see them in their most obscene denudedness; the whole town can watch them pass by. That solitude which was so dear to them has vanished; before, they were almost subjects for one another, their bond of interiority gave each of them abso- lute being; now, metamorphosed into this strange and sinister thing, a hearse, and "tossed about like a vessel," they become a pure object. Not entirely an object of scandal: "It is done in Paris" but not yet in the provinces; those good bourgeois see carnal love passing by in its hideous nakedness but do not recog- nize it. Yet Emma and Leon are the object of malice and laugh- ter. And their adventure, which seems to them an entirely new beginning, with irreversible, unforeseeable consequences, is objectified by the wearying, obstinate reappearance of the rickety old carriage in the same places in the form of an absurd cycle of repetitions. Everything has been said; Gustave can be happy, he has unrealized, dehumanized two human beings. Why these two more than others? Rodolphe, after all, is a rather repugnant character, and when Emma gives herself to him she may be more innocent but she is not exempt from bad faith. Yet the "coupling" in the woods, far from being ridiculous, is con- secrated by a kind of pantheistic effusion: "She gave herself up to him. The shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun . . . dazzled her eyes . . . luminous spots trembled . . . Silence was everywhere; something sweet seemed to come forth from the trees . . .Then from far away she heard ... a vague prolonged cry, a lingering voice, and in silence she heard it mingling like music with the last pulsations of her throbbing nerves . . " Although Gustave has always betrayed a certain repug- nance and almost fear when he speaks of "matings," it is quite clear that this one seems to him neither wretched nor ridicu- lous. This is first of all because coitus, here, is rid of all the idealistic mystifications that pave the way to it and justify it. Rodolphe is a professional seducer; he takes all responsibility upon himself, to the point of ignominiousness, thereby releas- ing Emma from it. She is conquered according to the rules of</page><page sequence="17">FLAUBERT 87 the art, and when she gives herself, the reader understands that she has been manipulated. So she screws innocently- that innocence which she is futilely determined to recapture in Leon's arms- there are no words in her head; but in place of the foolish and vague sentimentality which will presently compel her to toss off "cant remarks" about purity, poetry, the charms of nature, nature is simply there, mute, enclosing and penetrating her. We might say that Rodolphe is the means chosen by the cosmos to enter into this woman, just as the All manifests itself in the part at the risk of bursting it. The handsome gentleman's erect member, the dull pleasure (this will be specified for us a little later) he procures for himself- these are inessential; this deceiver is the world's dupe, the instrument chosen by it, on the occasion of a very maculate conception, to take into this woman a consciousness of self. Observe as well how Emma, alone in her room that evening, recalls this first embrace: "At first she felt stunned; she saw the trees, the paths, the ditches, Rodolphe, and she felt again the embrace of his arms while the leaves rus- tled and the reeds whistled." She sees herself in the mirror and is astonished: "Never had her eyes been so large, so black, full of such depth." The highly adept use of style indirect and the abrupt introduction of the pluperfect have the carefully calcu- lated effect of keeping us forever uncertain: does she really have eyes that have been widened and deepened by this experience, or is she merely imagining it? It seems to me that inauthenticity begins for her with the return of language, that is, in the follow- ing paragraph: "She repeated to herself, 1 have a lover! a lover!' " While she remains at the level of wordless memories and unadorned perceptions, she preserves in her something of that world which filled her and withdrew. What is certain is that in her memory, Rodolphe's embrace is not separable from the forest that surrounds them ("she saw the trees, the paths, the ditches") or from the rustling of the leaves or the whistling of the reeds. Thus the cosmos is there, all around her; yet if this enormous presence does not crush the young woman it is because the author has taken the cosmic point of view from</page><page sequence="18">88 SARTRE close up: the setting of the "coupling" refers to everything, but implicitly; the regard of the infinite turns itself into "something sweet"; the connections between outside and inside are rela- tions of interiority. She cannot see the "luminous spots" that tremble around her, but she is intimately bound to these glistenings, for "the horizontal sun. . .dazzled her eyes," and her face is itself a spot of light. Horizontal sun, azure, interstel- lar spaces, this earth that turns and is enveloped by the shades of night: the all is there but it is discreet, restrained, gently inter- nalized in this enraptured woman and at the same time gathered around her, totalizing and totalized in this privileged moment when language is dead, when the infinite silence of being is everywhere, even inside her- delivered from the com- monplaces that haunt her- when the mute consciousness of a dazzlement and the dazzling setting sun are one. On her back, her body plowed by a man's member, her eyes burned by the fire from a star, Emma is very close to realizing the vow of the last Saint Antoine: "to be matter." It is clear, in any case, that she does not experience orgasm; nor does Mazza when she gives herself to Ernest for the first time. But Mazza's initial frigidity left a disappointment for which nothing would compensate. Emma does not even perceive that she hasn't had pleasure - she has become the world. -translated by Carol Cosman</page></plain_text>
