<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dec. 28, 1889.1 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. 1433 RETROSPECT: 1889. THB future historian of medicine will not have to point to the year which is now closing as having witnessed any fundamental discovery, or the birth of any far reaching theory. The articles, which have been specially prepared.by.specialists for this number, chronicle rather a steady advance all along the line; this ought perhaps rather to be a matter for congratulation than regret. The advance which is made " by leaps and bounds " is sometimes, in science as in finance, delusive. Festina lente ! THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ITS SCIENTIFIC WORK. The Branches of the Association.-The scientific work of the Branches has, during the past year, been worthy of the best tradi tions of the Association, as is evidenced by the reports which have been published in the JOURNAL from week to week. During the last few months the Branches have also shown great activity in discussing the important question raised by Dr. RenLtoul con cerning the abuse of medical charities. The opinions expressed and the various remedies suggested will, it may be hoped, bring about some practical solution of this difficult but most momentous question. The Annual Meeting.-The fifty-seventh annual meeting, held at Leeds on August 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th, was eminently suc cessful. Though the attendance of members was not quite so large as on several previous occasions, the scientific work accom lished was of the highest excellence; in particular we may point to the reports of the proceedings of the Sections of Medicine, Sur gery, Obstetric Medicine, and Pharmacology and Therapeutics, which have recently been appearing in full in these columns; valuable work was also done in the Sections devoted tothe special departments of Psychology, Public Medicine, Laryngology, and Otology. The meeting had for its President an old and tried friend whohasserved the Association inmanycapacities, andwhohad been placed by the suffrages of the general practitioners of England at the head of the poll in the election of direct representatives on the General Medical Council. Very appropriately, therefore, Mr. Wheelhouse selected for his presidential address a subject of the first practical importance-the Practical Element iD Medical Edu cation. While all are'agreed as to the importance of the end, differences of opinion as to the means are inevitable, and the true solution can only be obtained through the free ventilation of opinions, perhaps better described as convergent than divergent, to which the columns of the JOURNAL have been open. The three general addresses were directly concerned with the nature or treatment of disease, and were delivered by such masters in their own departments as Dr. Hughlings Jackson, who delivered the address in Medicine; Mr. T. Pridgin Teale, who delivered that in Surgery; and Sir J. Crichton Browne, who delivered an address in Psychology. The Stewart Prize was presented to Dr. E. Klein, F.R.S., for his valuable researches on micro-organisms, and " espe cially for work in connection with etiology of scarlet fever." The Next Annual Mfeeting.-The fifty-eighth annual meeting will be held at Birmingham under the presidenc, of Dr. W. F. Wade, Senior Physician to the Birmingham General Hospital and one time Treasurer of the British Medical Association. For the purposes of the meeting the Town Hall, Mason Science College, Queen's College, and Midland Institute have been placed at the disposal of the local Committee, which is now engaged in making the necessary arrangements for the work of the Sections and for the business of the general meetings. There is every reason to anticipate a most successful meeting, and the numerous places of historical interest within easy reach of Birmingham will afford various opportunities for many interesting excursions. Scientific Grants Committee.-The research scholarships in stituted by the Association are at present held by Dr. Ralph Stock man, assistant to the Professor of Materia Medica in the Univer sity of Edinburgh, and Dr. Sidney Martin. Reports have been received and published in the JOURNAL, from the former on the coca alkaloids and from the latter on proteid poisons. Annual grants, amounting altogether to ?300, have also been made to a number of scientific workers, and the following reports have been received and published during the year: Professor Victor Horsley and Mr. Walter G. SDencer. on the contro1 of hmmorrhaze from the middle cerebral artery and its branches by compression of the common carotid; on intestinal surgery, by Dr. Frederic B. Jessett; on the etiology of summer diarrhoea, by Mr. Henry Tomkins; on cerebro-spinal fluid, by Dr. W. D. Halliburton; on proteid poisons, with special reference to that of the jequirity (Abrus precatorius), by Dr. Sidney MIartin; on the physical condi tion of London school children, by Dr. Francis Warner; on the influence of lesions of the corpus striatum and optic thalamus on the body temperature, by Dr. W. Hale White; on the medico-legal detection of human blood, by Dr. S. Monckton Copeman; on the relation of the ptomaines or animal alkaloids to some of the infectious fevers, by Mr. Arthur P. Luff; on the structure of the vertebrate liver, by Messrs. T.W. Shore and H. Lewis Jones. The Library of the Association.-The Council of the Association during the past year granted a sum of ?300 for the purchase of books for the library of the Association; this sum has been chiefly expended on the purchase of works of reference, and the books thus added, together with the numerous donations which have been made during the year, raised the total number of volumes in the library to over 2,000. The collection, though so recently begun, already possesses several of the most important reference series in French and German as well as in English medical literature, which may be consulted by members of the Association, in the spacious council room at the offices in the Strand. In order, however, to render the library still more generally available, and to meet especially the wants of provincial members, a scheme for lending the books with proper safeguards is now under consideration. Therapeutic Committee.-The Therapeutic Committee has dur ing the past year instituted pharmacological investigations, which have been carried out under the personal superintendence of Dr. Lauder Brunton, Professor D. Y. Leech, of Owens College, Manchester; and Professor Theodore Cash, of Aberdeen. The Com mittee is now extending its work beyond pharmacology to purely therapeutical questions-the utility of drugs in the treatment of disease. The Committee have selected a certain number of workers, but all members of the Association are invited to co-operate. A sum of ?200 has been granted to meet the necessary expenses for drugs, apparatus, etc. GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL. New Members.-The British Pharmacopwia.-Systematic Lec tures.-Clinical Study of Infectious Diseases.-Practical Ele ment in Medical Education.-Lengthening of the Curriculum. Clinical Instruction in Mental Disease.-Diplomas in State Medicine.-Disciplinary Cases.-Registration of Midwives. New Members.-The vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. Aquilla Smith, for many years the representative of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, was filled by the nomi nation of Dr. Lombe Atthill. Dr. W. S. Church was elected by the University of Oxford to the vacancy caused by the death of Dr. T. K. Chambers. Dr. Donald MacAlister succeeded Professor Humphry as the representative of the University of Cambridge. The British Pharmacopria.-The Council adopted the recom mendations of the report of the Pharmacopoeia Committee, pre sented by Dr. Quain, to the effect that an addendum to the last edition of the Pharmacopoeia should be prepared and issued as early as possible in 1890. Systematic Lecture.-During the spring session Dr. Kidd, on the part of the Education Committee, moved a resolution intended to reduce the enormous number of systematic lectures which students were now required to attend. A candidate for the de gree of the University of Edinburgh had to attend, it was stated. 1,300 lectures. The Education Committee, in its report, expressed itself " strongly of opinion that the number of systematic lectures in certain subjects of medical education should be reduced." Clinical Study of Infectious Diseases.-The importance of re quiring from candidates a practical acquaintance with the sym ptoms and treatment of infectious disease has frequently been discussed and affirmed by the Council in former y-ears, and this year a deputation to the President of the Local Government Board was appointed to represent to him the urgent need for making the metropolitan infectious hospitals available for the study of infectious disease. Practical Element in Medical Education.-At the spring meet ing Dr. Glover, one of the direct representatives for England, brought forward a motion calling attention to the reports of the TIRnPdetora of Eraminations with reference to the;r hbarinT on the I 1.5131 5</page><page sequence="2">1434 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28, 1889. practical element in medical education. The important speech which he delivered on this occasion was subsequently issued in a separate form, and was recently the subject of extended comment in these columns. No action has yet been taken by the Council, but the question will be brought up again at the first meeting of the Council next year. Lengthening of the Curriculum.-Meanwhile, however, an in terim report was presented on November 30th by the Education Committee. This contained the important statement that the Com mittee were unanimously of opinion " that steps should be taken by the Council to fix the period of study to be five years." Clinical Instruction in Mental Disease.-During the spring ses sion a resolution was adopted expressing the opinion that the pro posal before the County Council for London to establish a hos pital with a visiting medical staff for the study and treatment of insanity would be of great educational value, by affording to prac titioners and students increased facilities for becoming acquainted with the early symptoms and treatment of insanity. Diplomas in State Medicine.-A great deal of the Council's time was given to settling the regulations as to the examinations for diplomas in State Medicine held by the various qualifying bodies. A proposal to appoint inspectors of these examinations was also under consideration, and the Executive Committee was authorised to draw up a scheme should the Council's legal advisers be of opinion that it was legally empowered to inspect the examina tions. Disciplinary Cases.-A very large part of the sessions was taken up with the hearingof disciplinary cases, and in discussing proposed improvements in the procedure in such cases. In certain cases the Council reinstated names which had been removed by it at a pre vious session; the temporary removal of the name having been, it was apparently considered, sufficient punishment for the irregu larities committed. Registration of Midwives.-After a discussion which was un duly prolonged by the introduction of a proposal to express an opinion as to the desirability of registering sick nurses, the Council passed a resolution reaffirming once more that the want of proper public provision for the certification of competent midwives was conducive to a large amount of suffering and danger to life among poor lying-in women. On the motion of Sir Walter Foster, a reso lution was also adopted urging upon the Government the import ance of making statutory provision for the education and regis tration of midwives. U-NIVERSITIES, COLLEG-ES, AND MIEDICAL SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND. UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. Clinical Teaching.-During the past year the chief teaching of medicine and surgery has been carried on by the Lichfield Lecturers, who have given regular instruction in medical and surgical ward work intended to serve as a preliminary to more advanced clinical teaching in London. Dr. Collier and Mr. Lewis Morgan have succeeded Dr. Brooks and Mr. Symonds as Lichfield Lecturers for the coming two years. It is very difficult for students to attend regularly to the practice of the Radcliffe Infirmary, as the physicians and surgeons visit the wards in the morning, at which time students are engaged in science work at the museum. To obviate this inconvenience the physicians of the infirmary have arranged to devote two afternoons in each week to instruction in the wards. Comparative Anatomy.-In the department of comparative anatomy, Professor Moseley is still absent owing to continued ill health, and Mr. Hatchett Jackson, of New College, has been elected to carry on the work for a further period of a year. Mr. 0. Lather of Keble College, and late Berkeley Fellow of Owens College, Manchester, has succeeded as demonstrator MIr. G. C. Bourne, who has left Oxford to take on the direction of the British Marine Zoological Station at Plymouth. Mr. C. P. Mitchell, of Christ Church, has continued to assist the department as junior demon strator. Mr. E. Poulton, late science tutor of Keble College, who has done much work on colour in animals, has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. The number of students attending lectures in comparative anatomy has averaged twenty-one. Human Anatomy.-The department of human anatomy has been well attended during the year, and though the University Lecturer (Mr. Arthur Thomson) is unaided in the teaching, the number of lectures and practical demonstrations shows the activity of the department. Buildings and endowments to provide assist ance both in teaching and in the procuring of specimens for demonstration are much required. The dissecting room and lecture theatre are only temporary buildings, and it is evident that the next expenditure on science must be the provision of a home for human anatomy which will compare with the Phvsiological Laboratory. Physiology.-Owing to illness of Professor Burdon Sanderson, the physiological department has for the past few months been deprived of its head. Mr. F. Gotch has taken on the work for the Professor, and has been assisted by Messrs. Dixey and Haldane. The last report issued by Dr. Sanderson shows that thirty-seven students have attended various courses of instruction during the year of which number eighteen were preparing for honours in physiology, whilst the remainder were students working th e pre liminary honour school or for medicine. It is obvious that this department is of great importance to the large number of students of philosophy and psychology in the University, and especially to those who are endeavouring to gain some insight into the physio logical antecedents of mental phenomena. Physiology thus recruits its ranks both from the science undergraduates who are passing through this school, and also from those who have taken their degree in the classical school. Botany.-The department of botany has undergone an important change since last year, Professor Sydney Vines, of Christ's College, Cambridge, succeeding Professor Balfour, who has been appointed Professor of Botany at Edinburgh. This department shows signs of increased activity, the number of students having risen from ten to twenty-three during the year. Some of the students working in this department are women students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Halls. Botany seems an ideal subject for lady undergraduates who are wishing to work at science in preference to classics. The professor has been assisted in the work of the department by Mr. J. B. Farmer who lhas recently been elected to a Science Fellowship at Magdalen College. Chemistry.-Chemistry still asserts its superiority to the other science departments in its power of attracting students. During the year the number of students working regularly in this depart ment, averaged over a hundred in addition to others who attend for special instruction, of whom no record was kept. Junior Scientific Club.-Perhaps the clearest indication of the steady growth of interest in science in the University is afforded by the Junior Scientific Club. This is an association for resident science students below the degree of M.A., which forms a common meeting ground for students in the various departments. The growth of the club has been extremely satisfactory, and there are now about a hundred resident members on its books. UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. 71Iedical Students.-The past year has been one of steady growth in the departments of natural science and medicine. The number of medical students entered during the Michaelmas term is some thing over 120, and there appears to be no diminution in their reputation for good discipline and steady work, a reputation which is attracting the attention of those who have hitherto been least favourable to the development of the medical school. Buildings and Appliances.-The new buildings for human anatomy are rapidly approaching completion, and promise to give, if not magnificent, still abundant, accommodation for the excellent collection in anatomy and anthropology which have been gathered, but hitherto anything but well displayed, by Professor Humphry and Professor Macalister. The old chemical laboratory has been completely transformed into a very commodious and well-furnished pathological laboratory under Professor Roy, and we hear rumours that in some part of it, at leasA, the germ of a new Institute of Preventive Medicine may find a home. By the munificence of Professor Henry Sidgwick, who gave a "grant in aid" of no less than ?1,500, it has become possible for the University to undertake the long-delayed extension of the physiological laboratory, now for several years inadequate to the accommodation of researchers and teachers. This, with the handsome new lecture-room, which is included in the plans, and will be used by physiologists and anatomists in common, will render possible many projected improvements in the carrying on of the classes in these subjects. The chief thing now remaining to be done, to give the medical school breathing room, is to transform the buildings soon to be vacated by hu:iman anatomy into class rooms for the professors and lecturers in the purely medical and surgical subjects. The old octagonal building and its annexe., which have already outlived several transmutations, and are</page><page sequence="3">Dec. 28, 1889.] THE BBITISI MEDICAL JOURNAL. 1483 endeared, in spite of many inconveniences, to generations of teachers and students, will thus experience what is probably a final change before they are swept away to make room for the Sedgwick Memorial Museum. The operating room at Adden brooke's Hospital has also, by the liberality of the physicians and surgeons, been :enlarged and improved, so that students may observe with greater comfort and attention the work of the surgeons. General Mlledical Council.-The vacancy caused by the regretted retirement of Professor Humphry, after twenty years' service on the General Mledical Council, was filled up, not without a contest, by the election of Dr. Donald IN acAlister, of St. John's College, for a period of five years. The almost unanimous support accorded to the successful candidate by the resident members of the medical faculty, and by a large majority of the professors and other resi dent graduates, justifies the supposition that Dr. MacAlister is re garded as representing the progressive spirit which, in a 'decade or so, has transformed Cambridge from one of the smallest into one of the largest medical schools of England. Fellowvships.-The election to a Fellowship of Mr. Francis Darwin, M.B., at Christ's; of Dr. Gaskell, at Trinity Hall; and of Mr. H. D. Rolleston,M.B., at St. John's, are significant, to those who remem ber the old way of dealing with these rewards, of the advance of the medical sciences in the favour of Collegiate governing bodies. Examinations.-No change of importance has been made in the curriculum and examinations during the past year, if we except the fact that it has become necessary to provide for additional ex aminers in medicine and surgery, owing to the increase in the number of candidates for the Third M. B. and B. C. examinations. The desire of the Medical Board to obtain outside help in ascer taining the fitness of their students for the distinction of a degree is expressed by the appointment of such examiners as Dr. Ord, Dr. Dreschfeld, and Dr. Ralfe in medicine; MIr. Macnamara, Mr.Willett, and Mr. Hlerbert Page in surgery; and Dr. Galabin and Dr. Gervis in midwifery. At the final examination (Part II) in May and De cember 65 candidates in all satisfied the examiners, and it is noteworthy, in connection with remarks sometimes made on this snbject, that of these only one was not already a Bachelor or a Master of Arts. In the majority of cases the period of medical study of these candidates was well over six years, and as they have, after the final examination, to prepare and defend an origi nal thesis before admission to the M.B. degree, it cannot be said that the degree is too easily obtained. It is also worthy of note that this year the number of candidates for the Natural Sciences Tripos exceeded that for the Mathematical Tripos, hitherto the largest. UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. The report of the Royal Commission on university education in London over which Earl Selborne presided, recommended changes in the constitution of the University of a fundamental character. The Senate of the University has drawn up a scheme founded upon the report which however will require the assent of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons before the clauses affecting medical students can be operative. The scheme, the general features of which have already been indicated in the JOURNAL, was under the consideration of the Royal College of Physicians at its last meeting, and will no doubt be considered by the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons early next month. The question is of the greatest practical moment to medical students of the metro politan schools, and will it may be hoped, receive the full and im partial consideration which its great importance deserves. THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND. The Voting-Papers, the President's Speech at the Annual Mkeeting, and the Opening of the Library in the evening.-41n respect to the proceedings of the College there is much that is so current as to be well known to all amongst our readers who take any interest in such matters, and so much involving questions of routine and embedded in official formulas as to be unsuitable for a brief annual review. In the year 1889 three innovations appear con spicuous as part of the history of the college. At the July elections for members of Council, voting-papers first came into use, by which any Fellow can record his vote without attending the election in the College building in person. The election was held on July 4th. One prominent feature in the result was a considerable increase in the number of votes. Thus in 1887 only 199 valid votes were recorded; this year precisely r6OO were polled. The candidates were eight in number--Mir.Christopher Heath, Mr.IHulke, Mr. Howee, MIr. Rivington, Mr. Lawson Tait, Mr. Tweedy, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Cowell. The first three were elected to fill the vacancies caused by the retirement of Sir James Paget, who did not offer himself for re-election, and of Mr. Hulke and Mr. Heath, who were re-elected. The result showed that although the powerful influences which impel Fellows of the College to vote for their old teachers and for representatives of medical schools in London were brought to bear on this occasion with unusual force, the highest number of votes recorded under those influences was under 400; that is, less than a third of the total number of Fellows. The three members who were elected are distinguished surgeons, but from the point of view adopted by the Association it is to be regretted that one or more of the candidates whose views are in accordance with those of the bulk of the Fellows and Members were not elected. A careful analysis of the voting, however, showed that only half the nominal list of Fellows voted. The dread of "spoilation" through reform in favour of the Members could not have been very great, since a large proportion of the majority evidently voted rather from custom than from fear of change. A pleasant feature at the Annual Meeting of Fellows and Members was the address delivered by the President, Mr. Hutchinson. He deliberately reviewed the more important topics contained in the Annual Report, and spoke very moderately on contentious matter. Dr. Elliston, of Ipswich, moved a resolution, which was seconded by Dr. Danford Thomas, and carried by a large majority, urging that immediate steps should be taken to forward the introduction, early next session, of a Bill to amend the constitution of the Col lege, so as to secure a just representation in and upon the govern ing body of that institution. The third innovation was the de cision of the Council, at its Quarterly Mleeting in October, to open the College Library of an evening " as an experiment." The Library was therefore kept open from October 21st till the end of December, till 9 p.m., on every week-day evening excepting Saturday. We hope that the experiment may prove a success. It is certain that many have already availed themselves of that convenient hour before dinner, during which the Library has hitherto been closed but is now opened. The C'ollege and its Memrbers.-There remains a novelty far less pleasing to record. The dispute between the Council of the College and the Association of Members reached a very acute stage early in the spring of 1889. That Association entered into negotiations with the Privy Council relative to a Bill for increasing the privileges of Members, described elsewhere in this Retrospect. In the course of these transactions, the Association requested the President and Council to convene a meeting. This request, made in official foam, was refused. The Members, acting on legal advice, convened a meeting, t'o be held in the College premises themselves, after giving due notice to the Council. The meeting was publicly announced for February 28th. The Council, thereupon, closed the entire College buildings, including the Library and Museum, on the day announced for the assembly. The Members made a demonstra tion outside the closed gates of the College, and legal proceedings, not yet settled, followed the high-handed action of the Council. The legal question, in relation to the dispute, turned on the first clause of the seventeenth by-law of the College, wherein the right of convening meetings is solely vested in the President and Council, and where Fellows and Members who infringe the clause are rendered liable to severe penalties. The Association of Members,. acting on legal advice, maintained that the penal clauses, at least, were not of legal validity, nor applicable to the question in hand. Business of the Council.-We will pass over the intricate pro ceedings which necessarily occupied the attention of the Council through the disputes with Fellows and Members above noted. The unveiling of the bust of the Queen was a pleasing transaction which the College shared with the College of Physicians. The four years' reign of AMr. Savory as President came to an end in July, when Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson was elected President and Mr. Bryant and Mr. Croft Vice-Presidents. The Council prosecuted several professional malefactors with laudable activity, and claimed, in negotiations with the Medical Council, that their disciplinary powers be enlarged. The Council nominated Mr. Mlacnamara as their representative in a committee appointed by the War Office to consider the pay and condition of army and navy surgeons, in which capacity he showed great ability and public spirit. Lavislh expenditure has been incurred in enlarging the College buildings; and about ?500 will be expended in additional fire apparatus. The Council have approved of the extension of professional study from four to five years, and are considering how to effect the</page><page sequence="4">1486 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. LDec. 28, 1889. change in harmony with the- sister College. This projected step is a very grave step, but one entirely in accord with the growing necessities of the higher medical education. The time allotted for medical education is very short, its extension will no doubt be, in practice, a serious matter for impecunious students and their parents, but if it operates to lessen the pressure of new candidates for admission into the profession, that result will not be unsatis factory. The Council are also endeavouring to pass more stringent regulations to enforce the holding of clinical appointments by candidates. Lectures.-The Hunterian Oration was delivered on February 14th by Mr. Henry Power. The Morton Lecture, on Cancer, was delivered by Mr. John Marshall, on November 18th; the Bradshaw Lecture, by Mr. Bryant, on December 5th. Prize.-The Council awarded to Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, jun., the Jacksonian Prize, for his essay on " The Pathology, Diagnosis, and Surgical Treatment of Intracranial Abscess and Tumour." ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF LONDON. Two importants events have occurred at the College of Physicians during the past year. On February 8th, Dr. Seaton moved and Dr. Samuel West seconded, a resolution that " a committee be appointed to consider whether and in what way the fever hos pitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board can be made available for clinical 'study." A large committee including representatives from all the metropolitan schools was appointed, and the com mittee in due time made a report which was adopted, and has already borne fruit, for it is an open secret that it was entirely owing to the action of the College of Physicians that the clause relating to this matter in the Poor Law Amendment Act which was passed last summer was inserted, and at the present time, re presentatives of the College are actively engaged with the autho rities of the Board in working out the details by which effect shall be given to the clause. The other important event is the resignation of Sir Henry Pitman, after thirty years' service as Registrar, the College in accepting his resignation elected him Emeritus Registrar in recognition of his invaluable services. Dr. Edward Liveing, who has been for three years assistant-registrar, has been elected to succeed him. Early in the year, though a long time after the event, a resolution was passed condemning The Fatal Illness of Frederick the Noble, by Sir Morell Mackenzie, written at a time when he was a Member of the College. Sir Andrew Clark has been elected President for the second time, and Dr. Quain and Dr. Wilks have been elected Vice-Presidents. The Goulstonian lectures were delivered by Dr. Howard Tootb, on secondary degene rations of the spinal cord, the Croonian lectures by Dr. Lauder Brunton, on the relationship between chemical structure and pysiological action; the Lumleian lectures by Dr. John Harley, on enteric fever; the Milroy lectures b Dr. Arlidge, on occupations and trades in relation to public hea th. Dr. Norman Moore gave the Bradshaw lecture on visceral new growths: and Dr. James Pollock gave the Harveiaa oration. On May 24th, the Prince of Wales unveiled the statue of the Queen at the Examination Hall, on the Thames Embankment, in the presence of a large number of fellows of the two Colleges. TheBaly medal was awarded to Prof. Heidenhain, of Breslau, and the Swiney prize to Dr. C. Meymott Tidy. The College portrait gallery has been enriched by likenesses of the late Sir George Burrows, of Sir William Jenner, and the late Dr. Wilson Fox. Twelve Members have been elected to the Fellow ship, and many new Members have been admitted. The licence of the College was granted to 467 gentlemen, of whom 326 presented themselves under the regulations of the Examining Board. SCIENTIFIC PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL JO URNAL. THE compilation of an analytical subject catalogue of the very numerous original scientific articles which have appeared in the JOURNAL would be a task of great magnitude, and would occupy a great deal of space. In the following paragraphs are enumer ated some of the more important articles not mentioned in subse quent pages. The list is by no means complete, and we are consciou3 that many communications of great value have been omitted, in particular tbe numerous practical notes classified under the general head of Memoranda, which often contain clinical ob setvations of exceptional interest. Neither do these paragraphs contain any reference to the very considerable number of articles on ophthalmcdogy, laryngology, and other special departments, which yet have been fairly rppreEented. Many important repoTts made to the Scientific Grants Committee, and subsequently pub. lished in the JOURNAL, have already been noticed. Medicine.-Sir Andrew Clark, President of the Royal College of Physicians, has contributed his address on non-tubercular and non cardiac hsemoptysis. A paper has been published by Sir George Paget, on a case of alternate partial anesthesia. The Lettsomian Lecture by Dr. W. R. Gowers on syphilis and the nervous system, the address by Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, on the relation of neurology to surgery and dermatology, and a paper by the same author on leprosy, will have been read with interest. The various clinical features of albuminuria have been discussed in papers by Dr. George Johnson and F. W. Pavy. The Goulstonian Lectures by Dr. H. H. Tooth on secondary degenerations of the spinal cord, and the Milroy Lectures by Dr. Arlidge on trade diseases; a paper by Sir Peter Eade on the association of erythema and acute rheumatism with chorea, a paper on tropical diarrhcea or white flux ty Sir Joseph Fayrer may also be mentioned. Dr. W. M. Ord and Dr. J. F. Good hart have contributed papers on glycosuria. Surgery.-Sir Joseph Lister's address describing his new anti septic dressing, the Morton Lecture on cancer by Mr. John Marshall, President of the General Medical Council, Sir Henry Thompson's report of his experience of the suprapubic operation have been recently published. The papers by Mr. Henry Morris on renal surgery; by Mr. Frederick Treves on typhlitis; by Mr. T. R. Jessop on cancer of the rectum; by Mr. McGill on prostatec tomy, and the discussions thereon at the annual meeting, will have been read with instruction. Professor Thomas Annandale's description of his method of excision of a semilunar cartilage, and an article on intubation of the larynx by the same surgeon, Mr. Priestley Smith's valuable lectures on glaucoma, the clinical lectures conducted by Mr. Chrietopher Heath on the common diseases of the breast, and his address on tumours and on shock, and Mr. C. B. Lockwood's lectures on hernia may also be mentioned. Papers on the surgical treatment of py loric obstruction have been contributed by Dr. W. Gardner. Mr. C. J. Bond, and Mr. F. Treves. Abstract reports of Mr. Berkeley Hill's lectures on some affections of the genito urinary organs, and of Mr. Howard Marsh's lectures on surgical tuberculosis were prepared by the respective authors. Sir Spencer Wells has contributed, in conjunction with Dr. W. N. Maccall and Professor Dreschteld, a report of a successful case of splenectomy. Obstetrics and Gyn&amp;ecology.-The value of electricity in gynEe cology was the subject of a discussion at the annual meeting, in troduced by Dr. W. S. Playfair. A paper by Dr. Thomas Keith had been previously published, and its conclusions had been con troverted by Mr. Lawson Tait. Dr. J. H. Aveling had also con tributed a paper on the subject. An address by Dr. G. E. Herman on the pathological relationships of uterine displacements; a paper on placenta praevia by Dr. Braxton Hicks; on the action of certain drugs on the pregnant uterus, by Dr. Lombe Atthill, Pre sident of the King and Queen's College of Physicians; an address by Dr. Robert Barnes on the analogies of menstruation, pregnancy, and labour; an historical note on ovariotomy in Spain by Sir Spencer Wells; and a paper on gonorrhoea as an element in the etiology of certain of the diseases of women by Dr. C. J. Culling worth, are a few among the many communications in this im portant department. Pathology.-Pasteur's method of treating rabies has been dis cussed and defended by Professor Horsley and Dr. A. Ruffer. M. Pasteur's Croonian lecture on preventive inoculation, Mr. Adami'a account of an outbreak of rabies among deer, and of his personal experiences of M. Pasteur's method, have also been published. Mr. Hankin's important observation on the production of immunity from anthrax by means of a chemical substance marks a distinct ad vance in this department of pathology. Dr. George Thin's report of his experiments with the fungus of ringworm, Mr. Bland Sutton's lectures on evolution in pathology, Dr. R. G. Patteson's paper on trichomycosis nodosa, papers on actinomyces by Pro fessor McFadyean and Mr. F. Eve, Dr. William Hunter's lectures on transfusion, and Professor J. A. McWilliams's experimental observations on cardiac failure and on the electrical stimulation of the heart in man also call for mention. Therapeutics.-We have but recently published Professor D. J. Leech's admirable address on recent hypnotics. Dr. Goodhert's paper, giving his experience with some of these drugs, and Dr. Hale White's clinical notes on chioralamide have afforded reliable information as to some of the most recent advances. Valuable co, trh')utions to knowledge were also contained in the papers on</page><page sequence="5">Dec. 28, 1889.] THE BRITISH MEDiCAL JOURNAL. 1437 the action of paraldehyde and urethiane by Dr. John Gordon, and on the phenacetins by Dr. Dujardin-Beaumetz. Dr. Lauder Brunton's Croonian lectures on the relationship between chemical structure and physiological action, an instructive discussion on f)od3 for invalids and infants introduced by Drs. Burney Yeo and Sidney Martin, a report by Professor Charteris and Dr. Maclen nan on natural and artificial s%licylates, and Professor T. R. Fraser's paper on the relative value of opium, morphine, and codeine in diabetes mellitus all dealt with subjects of great prac tical importance. SOCIETIES. Roy'slMedzcaland C/sirurgicalSociety.-InthisSociety thepapers read numbered twenty-five, of which ten were relative to purely medical, and fifteen to surgical topics. The year was opened by papers from Drs. A. Garrod and Herringham discussing the relations of chorea and rheumatism, the former physician contending that *' rheumatism was a very general disease of which arthritis was only one symptom." The contribution on actinomycosis hominis was the most important paper of the year. This was founded on a case under the care of Dr. Douglas Powell and Mr. Godlee in the Brompton Hospital for Diseases of the Chest. The whole subject was reviewed at length, and beautifully illustrated by micro scopical sections prepared by Mr. H. H. Taylor, specimens being shown of the ray fungus as met with in man and the bovine tribe. Several papers were read on subjects connected with the surgery of the abdomen, the most noticeable being on the removal of a gangrenousvermiform appendix containing a faecal concretion, and followed by secondary laparotomy for suppurative peritonitis, ending in recovery. This was a case under the care of Sir Dyce Duckworth and Mr. L ington. The surgery of the kidney was illustrated by a series of twenty nephrectomies by Mr. Knowsley Thornton, who warmly advocated the anterior operation through the peritoneum. This view is still sub judice, as several well known surgeons prefer the retro-peritoneal incision. Cases of cholecyst enterostomy byMr.MayoRobson,and abdominal sectionforruptured tubal pregnancy by Mr. Bland Sutton, were brought . before the Society. There was only one paper on the surgery of the cerebro-spinal system, but it marked an advance in that branch of science. This detailed a case of severe spasmodic pain in the leg and thigh, for which nerve stretching, amputation, and nerve excision had been tried without any benefit ensuing. Mr. W. H. Bennett then opened the spinal column, and p3rformed subdural division of the pos terior roots of certain spinal nerves; the result of this was an im mediate cessation of the p%in, which had reduced the man to a con dition of great exhaustion. Unfortunately, the patient died un expectedly during apparent convalesence. Dr. Walker, of Peter borough, read a suggestive paper on the significance of colourless or clay-coloured stools without jaundice, and the part played by the pancreas in eliminating bile from the intestines. He contended that " in disease, a deficiency of pancreatic fluids will, equally with a deficiency of bile, cause the pathological condition of colourless or clay-coloured stools." Two cases were detailed in which a dia gnosis of obstruction of the pancreatic duct was made, and con firmed subsequently at the necropsy. It is probable that this paper will cause more of these cases to be recorded, as but few have been as yet observed. The session terminated with a cantribution from Mr. Roughton on the pathology of pulsating tumours of bone, in which the various conditions met were ablv discussed. Clinical Society.-The meetings, which from the foundation of the Society in 1867 had been held in Berners Street, have since the summer vacation taken place at the new home of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in Hanover Square. One other important change has occurred, in aceordance with a suggestion made by the new President, Mr. Christopher Heath; it is, that every othermeeting night is partly a clinical evening, the first hour being given up to the exhibition of cases, after which the usual papers of the Society are taken. On these evenings the proceedings commence at 8 o'clock. In January, a discussion on cancerous disease of the larynx took place. Mr. Butlin, Dr. D. Newman (Glasgow), and Dr. F. Semon contributed papers. Mr. Mayo Robson (Leeds) read a paperon nerve-grafting which originated an interesting discussion. Mr. H. W. Allingham read notes of a case of removal from the knee joint of a dislocated internal semilunar cartilage, with recovery, and a perfect joint. Mr Bowlby detailed notes of dislocation of the elbow-joint, with laceration of the ulnar artery, that ended in recovery and a freely movable joint. In February, Dr. Caton (Liver pool) described a case of narcolepsy; Dr. Savill, another of hystero epilepsy in a male; and Dr. S. West, a case of Raynaud's disease, with erysipelatous eruption on the face. Dr. Finlay described a case of tubercular disease, with inversion of the temperature curve; Dr. C. H. Ralfe contributed a case of suppression of urine caused by impaction of calculi in both ureters, and relieved by operation; Mr. Silcock described cases of chronic enlargement of the gastro cnemio-semimembranosus bursa, treated by partial excision. In March Drs. Whipham and DelMpine furnished a report of a case of tubercular lupus of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, producing stenosis of the trachea and bronchi; Mr. Bland Sutton described an erectile tumour removed from the mamma of a boy; Dr. Payne described a case of molluscum fibrosum; and Dr. Burney Yeo gave his personal experiences of quinine rash. Mr. Barwell described his instrument for measuring the different deviations in lateral curva ture of the spine; Mr. Jacobson gave a full report of four cases of nephrolithotomy, and Dr. Steavenson and Mr. Butler-Smythe, one of a case of the kind fatal from ulceration into a branch of the renal artery. In April. Mr. H. W. Allingham read notes of a case of cerebral heemorrhage, treated successfully by trephining; Dr. Lees and Mr. Page described a case of traumatic epilepsy treated by trephining; Dr. F. Semon exhibited a patient in whom unilateral in complete Graves's disease followed the removal of nasal polypi, and Mr. J . Hutchinson described acase of xanthelasma and gout with fusi form enlargement of many tendons. Dr. G. Macdonald and Mr. C. Symonds read notes of a case of total extirpation of the larynx for epithelioma, with recovery and a useful voice; Mr. A. Lane gave abstracts of five cases of disease of the middle ear complicated by suppuration in its vicinity, and Mr. B. Sutton described a case of leontiasis ossea. In May, Mr. W. H. Bennett gave an account of a case in which he had excised both angles of the inferior maxillcL for bilateral ankylosis, with resultant mobility of the jaw; Mr. B. Browne described a case of suprapubic prostatectomy; Mr. W. Anderson another of suprapubic cystotomy for tumour of the bladder, and Mr. Makins a case of intussusception treated unsuccess fully by excision. Mr. Mayo Robson exhibited a case in which he had obtained bony union of a transverse fracture of the patella by a new method, without opening the joint; he also described a case of successful tendon grafting; and Mr. Battle detailed one of com pound comminuted fracture of the tibia, with fracture of the fibula and resection of a part of the latter bone. In October, Mr. Mayo Robson communicated a paper on fourteen cases of cholecystotomy, which was discussed during the whole of one meeting. In November, Mr. Rivington read notes of a case of Pott's fracture with fracture and displacement of the astragalus, followed by symptoms of tetanus, which subsided after removal of the displaced fragment; Mr. Spencer described a case of irreducible dislocation at the elbow; Mr. Barton gave details of a case of paroxysmal methaemoglobinuria; Dr. S. Martin related the history of a case of pyloric gastric ulcer, fatal from h?ematemesis; Dr. Coutts and Dr. A. E. Garrod described three cases of rheumatic periostitis; Mr. B. Sutton described the treatment of a case of tumour of the infra-orbital nerve; and Dr. C. S. Watson narrated particulars of a case of ptomaine poisoning. In December, Mr. C. Symonds described nine cases of thyroid cysts and adenomata which he had successfully treated by excision, and Mr. Battle read notes of a case of diffuse aneurysm of the calf, treated by removal of parts of the popliteal and both tibial arteries. The cases exhibited on the clinical evenings have been of great interest, but want of space forbids us to notice them in detail. The Patholoqical Society of london-The meetings of the year commenced with the adjourned meeting for the discussion of the pathology of chronic alcoholism, a subject which had been intro duced by Dr. Payne at the end of the previous year. The conclusions which were brought to the front were three: (1) The close similarity of the action of alcohol on the tissues with that of several mineral andspecificpoisons,such asphosphor us,lead, and diphtheria; (2)that alcohol was an important factor in favouring tubercular disease and particularly pulmonary phthisis, and (3) that the organic changes produced by alcohol were of more importance than had been previously supposed. At this meeting Sir James Paget r *signed the position of President, which he had occupied with such benefit to the Society for the last two years. At the next meeting the new President, Dr. W. Howship Dickinson, gave his inaugural address on the subject of the past and future of pathology, in which he showed how great an advance the science had made during the last forty years, a period almost exactly coinciding with the age of the Society, and pointed out that, though many discoveries had been made, yet the problems to be solved were still more numerous. The work of the Society generally, has been similar to that of former years, the description and inspection of morbid specimens</page><page sequence="6">1438 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. LDec. 28, 1889. Mr. Armstrong on the education, qualifications, and status of the medical officer of health, was full of instruction and suggestion, and the work of the present session opened with papers by Dr. Reginald Dudfield on the revision of the Society's tables of births and deaths, and by Mr. St. Clair Shadwell oIn the need for infectious hospitals in the suburban districts of the metropolis. -Royal Academy of Medicine.-The sixth annual report shows that the Fellows number 244, the members 28, and the student associates 11, while the funds invested amount to ?596 2s. 4d., the balance in hand being ?11 19s. 3d.

Reports of the meetings of the Hunterian, the ILarveian, and the Epidemiological Societies; of the Society of Medical Officers of Health; of the Clinical, Pathological and Medical Societies of Manchester; of the Medico-Chirurgicai Societies of Cork, Bradford, Brighton, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Nottingham, Shef fleid, West Kent, and West London, among others, have also been published. [The work of the Obstetrical and Gynsecological Societies is mentioned at page 1463.1 with discussions after the papers. These have, perlhaps, been more varied than usual, and papers on specimens of animal and vegetable pathology are apparently becoming more numerous. There were several important papers on parasites, amongst which may be mentioned Drs. Gamgee and Delepine's paper on a case of actinomy cosis, a subject whicti has been attracting very considerable atten tion during the year, and concerning which, Mr. Bland Sutton suggested (from certain specimeIs of new growths of the uterus which he brought before the Society) that ti:iere might be some connection between the presence of this parasite and malignant erosions of the uterus. Specimens of other parasites (psorospermite) which, though common in some other mammalia, had only very rarely been found in human beings, were on two or three occasions brought before the Society. ln strictly human morbid anatomy, several specimens of new growths, having unusual characters, were described, especially a peculiar condition of cancer named by Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson " crateriform ulcer." All the cases that he had seen had been on the face, and consisted of bossy masses shaped like beehives, which grew rapidly and softened in the centre, leaving a deep central cavity. There was no tendency to infection of the glands, and after removal no local recurrence: examined microscopically they appeared to possess all the histological characters of epithelioma. Other specially noteworthy papers were: the President's, on hereditary albuminuria-in which he showed that in one family several individuals of three successive generations had suffered from Bright's disease, and that in the family portraits, which existed from the time of Edward IV., the skin had a similar pallor to that which characterised the living and late members, who were the subjects of the disease; Mr. Targett's on an apparently unique liver, which consisted almost entirely of fibrous tissue, infiltrated with calcareous deposits, so that the whole organ was of stony hardness, and two papers on rare tubercular conditihns-(1) by Mr. Golding-Bird on tubercular ganglia of synovial she ths; (2) by Mr. Shattock, who found that certain mammary absce3ses had a tubercular origin. Epidemiological Society.-The most important papers read during the past year were those by Professor Horsley on Pasteur's treat ment of hydrophobia, and Surgeon MIorris's on beri-beri. The former, which we published in extenso in our issue of February 16th, gas e a rational explanation of the modus operandi of the inoculations, and especially of the differences in procedure, and results of the "simple" and "intensive" methods, while it effectually disposed of the objections urged against M. Pasteur's statistics, by examining the numerical results of cases coming under group A, or those iII which the rabidity of the animals had been verified by the crucial test of experiment. Surgeon Morris gave the best description extant of beri-beri, with special reference to the paralytic pheno mena and pericardial effusion. The predisposing causes he believed to be malaria, unhygienic conditions, and insufficient diet, while hlomic and neurotic factors had equal shares in its pathology. Dr. P. S. Abraham contributed an exhaustive description of the distribution, etiology, and pathology of leprosy throughout the world, maintaining its bacillary nature and communicability, and exhibiting examples of the two typical forms. Dr. J. E. Squire treated of the prevention of [tubercular] phthisis, the modes by which the bacilli gained entrance to the organism, and the con ditions rendering the individual susceptible to infection. Dr. R. W. Smith read a paper on the relation of micro-organisms to diease, and Sir W. Xi oore one on malaria versus more recognisable causes of disease. The address of the new lresident, Sir T. Crawford, dealt with the statistics of acute specific diseases in the British army at home and ahroad, with special reference to enteric fever. Society of Medical Officers of Health.-Several papers of the highest interest were contributed during the present year, Dr. Tomkins, of Leicester, discussing the question of the compulsory notification of infectious diseases, and the objections urged against the single and dual systems. He was decidedly in favour of the latter, which had been found most successful in his own town, but was strongly of opinion that the medical offlcer should not be engaged in private practice. Indeed, the feeling of medical men in some places against the Acts, arose solely from the fact of the medical officer being a practitioner like themselves. Dr. Hope, of Liverpool, discussed the mest supply of large towns, the transport and slaughter of cattle, and the state of the law as regards diseased and unsound meat. Dr. J. F. J. Sykes criticised the present system of certification and registration of the causes of death, with suggestions for its amendment. Dr. Louis Parkes discussed the working of Torrens's Act, and Dr. Tomkins described an improved form of Ransome's disinfecting oven.

Changes in the Anatomical Wforld.- General Anatomy.-Muscular System.- Vascular System.-Osseous System.-Nervous System. -Special Senses and other Oryans.-Comparative Anatomy. Embryoloqy.- Teratology.-HZstology. Changes in the Anatomical World.-During the year the Ana tomical World has seen various changes. Professor Struthers has left the University of Aberdeen, and been succeeded by Dr. Reid, who was Lecturer at St. Thomas's Hospital. Tihe Anatomical Society has continued to flourish, and most excellent work has been laid before it. When our Association decided not to have an anatomical and physiological section at Leeds, this Society arranged to hold a meeting, and members will remember the very beautiful series of photographs which were shown by Professor Fraser, and the practical and instructive paper of Drs. Griffiths and Oliver. General Anatomy.-In general anatomy we have to record new editions of old favourites, and the appearance of some new and important works. Mr. Treves, Mr. Holden, and Mlessrs. Huxley and Martin have brought out new editions of their text books. Professor Alexander Macalister has enriched anatomical literature with a text book, which is a distinct advance upon previous works of the kind, and a credit to British anatomy. The subject is scientifically handled, and the latest views on morphology and embryology are embodied. Professor Cunningham has also brought out what is practically a new volume of his excellent series of manuals of descriptive anatomy. Muscular System.-Professor Windle has endeavoured in a paper which was read before the Royal Society to deal with the mor phology of the pectoral group of muscles. He considers that that portion of the lateral sheet of muscles consists of three segments, manubrial, gladiolar, and abdominal. Each of these segments has its own nerve and may undergo secondary lamination. These researches help to explain many interesting anomalies, such as the pectoralis minimus and the pectoralis quartus. Elsewhere,1 the same observer has brought up to date the current knowledge of that curious muscle, the rectus sternalis, and, on the whole, seems to agree with Professor Cunningham that it is derived from the pectoralis major by a process of displacement. In the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, Mr. J. T. Wilson gives a further series of observations on the innervation of the axillary muscles, and,two cases of variation of the nerve supply of the lumbricales. But, more important than these, are Professor B. Windle's observations on the flexors of the digits of the hand, which, we note, are only the first of what are intended to be a series of observations.2 In his Hunterian Lectures on Hernia, Mr. Lockwood has attached fresh importance to the suspensory muscle of the mesentery, by endea'vouring to show that when it fails to support the mesentery, an acquired hernia results.3 NJ. Nicaise has written upon the insertions of the aponeurosis of the external oblique,4 and wishes us to believe that the ligaments of Fallopius and Gimbernat do not exist. Most anatomists will recoil from this idea, and adhere to their old belief of that which they think they have so often seen. Vascular System.-The arteries seem an ever-fruitful field to till, and Dr. F. Rojecki has gathered from them much of interest, and has set it forth in a paper on the Arterial Circulation of the Macacus compared with that of the Anthropomorphic Apes and Man.5 Dr. H. D. Rolleston has likewise noted an interesting varia tion of the hepatic artery.'; A work which might easily be over looked, but which is of great merit, is Dr. Ewart's, on the Bronchi and Pulmonary Blood Vessels. This is a marked advance upon our previous knowledge of both those systems, and those who read it will find that the author is not an adherent to the generally acc?pted views of the late Professor Aeby. Osseous System.-Professor Cunningham has written an inter esting note on the occasional eighth true rib in man, and con siders it a reversion to type, and caused by the more frequent use of the right hand.7 The same anatomist, in the next pages almost, discusses the proportion of bone and cartilage in the lum bar section of the vertebral column of the ape and several races of man. In this and another paper, published in the Royal Society's Proceedings, it is shown that elongated lumbar bodies are a de cided degradation. The same author has likewise described the lumbar spine of an Australian aborigine.8 Braune, again, discusses the functions of the sternum, and considers it a check upon the movements of the ribs.9 Nervous System.-In Brain Dr. Gaskell gives the results of his latest researches on the origin of the nervous system of vertebrates. It is perhaps a surprise to those who are not versed in the more recent advances of morphology and embryology to learn that the nervous system has an intimate relation with the alimentary tract of the invertebrates, or even that its central hollows communicate with the fore and hind gut in vertebrates, and yet the first possibility has certainly had light thrown upon it by Dr. Gaskell's work. This suggestive writer also opens up many other interesting problems, which are referred to elsewhere. At the recent meet ing of the Anatomical Society, Professor Cunningham, in a most ingenious memoir, dealt with the intra-parietal sulcus, and showed with success that the ordinary accounts did not represent the common condition. The general morphology of the occipital lobes was also discussed, We understand that this important paper will shortly appear in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology. Two otlier essays of anatomical interest are also given in Bra?n: Dr. Meigs an essay on Asymmetry of the Olivary Bodies of the Medulla Oblongata, and Dr. Alexander Bruce an excellent addition to the number of cases of absence of the corpus callosum. We note in passing that the subject of this abnormality was fairly rational and only rather " dour." We also note an important paper by Dr. M. v. Lenhoss6k on the Course of the Posterior Roots of the Spinal Nerves in the Cord.10 Special Senses and Organs.-Schwalbe and His have both written upon the anatomy of the ear, and Taguchi discusses the topo graphical anatomy of the larynx.'1 The intranarial position of the epiglottis has also been brought prominently forward by Pro fessor Howes and Dr. Bowles. It has been clearly shown that although this is the usual condition in many animals that it is only occasional in the human subject.12 Comparative Anatomy:-Professor Ewart has continued the investigation of the cranial nerves of the elasmobranch fishes in his paper, which was read before the Royal Society in February. Sir Richard Owen communicated to the same Society an interesting description of the skull of an extinct carnivorous marsupial, of the size of a leopard, which was found in a cave in New South Wales. Professor Shufeldt has further contributions to the comparative osteology of the Arctic and sub-Arctic water birds; we have already noticed his previous work in this direction. P'rofessor Struthers has published his researches upon the humpback whale, a work which stamps him as a leading authority upon this branch of anatomy. The same observer has also compiled a list of the work he has achieved during a long and laborious career. In our columns we have reviewed Professor Marshall's work on the frog. Embryology.-The maturation of the ovum of the Cape and New Zealand species of peripatus has been described in the Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Sciences, by Miss Lilian Sheldon. The process seems to have been very clearly and successfully worked out by this lady. Drs. Thomas W. Shore and J. W. Picker ing have also described in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology the proamnion of the chick, a structuire which has already been seen in the rabbit by Van Beneden and others. In the same journal Mr. Frederick Tuckerman gives a further short account of the development of the taste buds of the human embryo. Thie develop ment of the nails of the human fcetus from their first appearance, until birth, has been described by F. Curtis."3 The nails of the lower limb, like the lower limb itself, are later in appearance than the nails of the hands. Preparations begin to be made for their development in the first week of the third month of intrauterine life, although we confess that we wonder how our author can speak with such certainty as to the ages of his embryos. Never theless, these researches are well worthy of study. In the same publication as that which contains the researches of Curtis, Mathias Duval describes the placenta of rodents, and his work is a great advance on that of Von Bischoff, which is usually quoted in our textbooks, but which has by this time had a good deal of doubt thrown upon it. Fourneux, whose work on the gubernaculum is 1 Anatomischer Anzeiger. 2 J. of A. Si P., Vol. iv, N.

[Dec. 28. 1889. well known, has an important contribution upon the development and evolution of the genital tubercle in the human foetus of both sexes, together with some remarks concerning the development of the prostatic glands. It is now beginning to be clear that the prostatic glands correspond to the urethral glands of the female. This question is raised by Fourneux,14 and further information upon the same point is found in Dr. Griffliths's paper on the origin and functions of the prostate.15 Professor Windle has also given an interesting summary of recent discoveries upon the segmenta tion of the ovum. G. Henricius's paper on the development and structure of the dog's placenta may also be mentioned, and Czerny's on the organ of Girald6s and Born's on the mamma lian heart."' William His, junior, who, we presume, is the son of the well-known His, has elucidated the development of the seventh pair of cranial nerves in the human embryo.'7 The heart and diaphragm are fast acquiring a literature of their own, and papers have been written upon their development by Raun, Strahl, and F. Carius, and others, in the Archiv. fuir Anatomie und Physiologie. The mesoderm is discussed by Carl Rabdl, in a long and learned paper, in which he leans to the view of its double origin.'8 Teratology.-The French have long been distinguished for the excellence of their teratological work, and Dr. C. Phisalix follows in excellent footsteps in his endeavours to elucidate Cyclopian monsters.'9 His material seems to have been derived from man, the dog, and sheep, and he gives a more minute account of the brain and eye of these creatures than we can remember to have met with. A case of hypospadias in a dog is also given by G. H. Roger.'0 Pouchet and Chabry continue the most important line of teratological investigation started by Dareste by ascertaining the influence of artificial sea water upon the development of marine animals. The results are very striking."2 Histology.-Anatomists have not yet resigned their rights to histology, and, therefore, we note Dr. W. A. Haswell's endeavour to reconcile, or clear up, all the difficulties which surround the comparative study of striated muscles. The drawings which accompany this essay are exceedingly good and a credit to the publication in which it appears, namely, the Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Sciences. Indeed, all the illhstrarions in this jour nal are excellent, and we wish we could say the same of all of those which appear in the sister journals. We also note that an excellent index of the Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Sciences and of the Transacttons of the Microscopical Society is given at the beginning Fof vol. xxx of the first-named publication. Although this is hardly an important event in the anatomical sense, yet it affords so much assistance to anatomists that it cannot be passed over in silence. Dr. F. Hermann's contri bution to that much-worked at subject, the histology of the testicle, will also repay perusal.22 From the above glimpse at that which our workers have done, it will be seen that anatomy is as progressive as it is important. PHYSIOLOGY. Congress of Physiologists.-Nervous System.-Muscle.-Blectrical Organs.-Alimentary Canal. - Calorimetry.- Blood. - Cells. BRespiration.-Circulation. Cmgress of Physiologists.-One of the most important events of the year for physiologists was their first International Congress held at Basle, in the month of September. It was attended by about 130 representatives from all the countries of Europe, and a few also from America. Of the many interesting communications and demonstrations made, the following were the most important: Professor His gave a summary of the results of his recent researches on the anatomy of the nervous system; the paper re lated in great measure to the cells the author has previously termed neuroblasts. Professor Heidentiain read a paper on the formation of lymph, stating, as the outcome of his researches, the conclusion that lymph results from the secretory activity of the cells of the capillaries. Professor Mosso spoke on the subject of fatigue in muscle. He showed an instrument called the ergograph, for obtaining the graphic record of the contractions of the human arm muscles, and compared the contractions produced by stimulating the median nerve obtained before and after a sitting of the Medical Examining Board; the contractions obtained after mental exertion were more feeble, and probably the brain during its activity gives rise to some substance of the nature of a poison. Professor Goltz showed a dog from which he had removed the leit half of the brain two years ago, and which now showed no signs of paralysis. Professor Horsley and Dr. Beevor gave a very suc cessful demonstration of the minute representation in the cortex. of the movements of the upper limb. Professor Horsley, with Mr. Gotch, also demonstrated the electrical variations that occur in the spinal cord during its activity. Professor Bowditch showed specimens of composite photography. Professor Fano showed some beautiful tracmgs of the heart of the chick on the second and third days of incubation. Professor Kronecker related his ex periments on the physiology of deglutition. Drs. Minkowski and Mering stated that complete extirpation of the pancreas gave rise to glycosuria. Professor Denys claimed to have found a peptonis ing ferment in the blood. Dr. Waller demonstrated the electro motive changes of the human heart, using electrodes placed in con nection with the limbs and head, and leading these off to a capil lary electrometer. Professor Hering gave an account of his. theory of colour vision, and demonstrated by many very simple and ingeniou3 pieces of apparatus experiments confirmatory of' his views. Drs. Dastre and Morat showed the presence of vaso dilatatorfibres forthe buccalregioninthe cervical sympathetic; and Professor Arloing read a paper on the properties of nerve fibres in the same region. Nervous System.-Gaskell has published a full account of some masterly researches on the structure and functions of the cranial nerves, together with a theory of the origin of the nervous system, in vertebrata. He shows that the cranial nerves are built up of somatic and splanchnic parts similar to those in the spinal: nerves; the splanchnic portions are small-fibred; the nerves also have two roots, the motor root alone remaining active in many. cases, the sensory root with its ganglion being atrophied; in. other cases the motor and sensory portions have bocome scattered,. are and known as separate nerves. The view of the development of the central nervous system, as a deposit of nerve ganglia finally fusing together around the old alimentary canal, will be read with interest by all embryologists. C. S. Sherrington has pub lished a preliminary account of his researches, the object of which is to ascertain to what extent there is in the pyramidal tract a grouping of nerve fibres corresponding to the grouping of nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. The most important result ob tained, in a very laborious and painstaking series of experiments,. is that the fibres of the tract branch as they pass down the spinal cord, one branch in many cases recrossing to the opposite side of the cord; the recrossed tracts are most numerous in the regions of the cervical and lumbar enlargements. Othet interesting points noted in the course of the inquiry are the degenerations that occur in the fornix and in the corpus callosum. A research on the spinal cord, which promises to yield important results, has been com menced by De Boeck. It relates to stimulation of different regions of the spinal cord by electrical current; indeed, it is almost the first attempt made at localisation in the cord by the method oft stimulation. The author has yet had time to do little more. than perfect his apparatus. He excites by means of a single needle. The advantage of unipolar excitations in localising func tions was first pointed out by Kuhne. The result of stimulating. one side of the cord is to produce movement generally of the same side, but often, though to a less degree, of the opposite side as well. Hale White draws the following conclusions from his further ob servations on the sympathetic ganglia:-First, that in lower mammals and young human beings, the collateral ganglia (judging. from the superior cervical and semilunar) are functionally active. but that in monkeys there are evidences of the commencing loss of their function, which has completely disappeared in the human adult; secondly, that in man the function of the lateral ganglia is maintained well into adult life,and onlybeginsto disappearinoldage Gad and Joseph bave investigated the spinal ganglia by both histological and experimental methods witb the following re sults:-Most of the centripetal nerve tracts are interrupted in the spinal ganglia by bipolar nerve cells. These cells have a tro phic influence on the flbres connected with them. Each func tional nerve impulse in a centripetal direction must pass through a nerve cell in the spinal ganglion. This probably gives rise to. delay, and it may be here that the summative effects of sub minimal stimuli are brought about. J. R.

They are of two kinds, constrictor and dilatator, the former being the more abundant. Expansion is sometimes obtained by excitation of the central end of a posterior nerve root of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth nerves. The vagus does not apparently contain vasoconstrictor nerves for the kidney ves sels. There is no decussation of the vasomotor fibres in the splauchnic, the right splanchnic apparently supplying only the right kidney. J. R. Bradford, with H. P. Dean, has done an im portant piece of work on the innervation of the pulmonary blood vessels. The method adopted was to excite the roots of the spinal nerves, and to observe the effects of such stimulation on the aortic and pulmonary blood pressure respectively. Their experiments show that there is in the medulla a mechanism, stimulation of which causes a contraction of the pulmonary vessels, and that in the dorsal nerves, from the second to the seventh (in the dog), there are vasoconstrictor fibres passing to the pulmonary vessels. G. N. Stewart has continued his researches on the stimulation effects in a polarised nerve during and after the flow of the polar ising current. He insists that a distinction must be drawn between excitability and conductivity, and, contrary to generally received notions, finds that these are not necessarily altered in the same way during and after the electrotonic state. For instance, he finds that the conductivity is depressed around the cathode dur ing the flow, except with weak currents; the excitability here is at the same time increased. Gross has published a paper on the refractive index of the living axis cylinder; the mean value found was 1.367. On activity this does not alter, or at least does not alter so much as to affect the fourth place of decimals. Mu8cle.-E. Miinzer has continued the study of the remarkable experiment shown by Kluhne in his Croonian lecture to the Royal Society, namely,secondary contraction from muscle to muscle; this experiment has also been the subject of study by Regeczy. Munzer differs from Regeczy somewhat, stating that a secondary stimulation from muscle to muscle never occurs through a ten dinous inscription. J. Bernstein also enters the lists with Regeezy on the subject of the theory of electrical stimulation; these polemical papers will be found in Pfli*qer8 Archiv. Loeb and von Koranyi have made an extensive study of voluntary muscular contraction, especially of the arm, and the relation of the work done with the various parts of the contraction. A paper of rather psychological than physiological interest by J. Orchansky on voluntary activity should be read in connection with the above just mentioned. W. P. Lombard, from a careful study of the knee-jerk, concludes that the reflex theory is the most satisfactory the difficulty, however, of therapidity of the process still remains unexplained. The latent period of muscle as determined by Yeo is shorter than has been hitherto considered. Marey has investi gated certain muscular movements, such as the closure of the gand and the flight of a bird, by means of photochronography, a method introduced by Muybridge in the study of the locomotive movements of quadrupeds. Miss Brinck, and Miss Popoff, in Kronecker's laboratory, have tested on the frog's and turtle's heart the nutritive action of various proteid fluids; the main result of these experiments is to extend to this, and later to skeletal muscle, the conclusion that serum albumin is the nutritive proteid par excellence. It should however be noted in passing that Ringer's results with saline solutions do not appear to have had sufficient weight with these investigators. Lauder Brunton believes that there are several phenomena connected with muscular contrac tion, which are best explicable by the hypothesis that relaxation is not merely a passive action, but due to contraction in the transverse direction. R. Nicolaides has previously shown that immediately after a muscle is cut out, its excitability is some what increased; he now shows by experiments with the capillary electrometer, that the muscle current runs parallel in this respect to the excitability. Electrical Organs.-Burdon Sanderson and F. Gotch have pub lished a further contribution on the electrical organ of the skate, the nature of the normal reflex, and the measurement of the elec tromotive force of the response of the organ to a single stimula tion being the subjects more especially dealt with. The reflex centre is situated m the optic lobes; each disc of the organ is capable of developing during excitation, evoked by a single in duction shock, an electromotive force of over 0.02 Daniell, which is extraordinarily great as compared with muscle. A critical survev of the work done by Sanderson and Gotch on electrical organs has been published by Du Bois Reymond, who is a great authority on this particular subject. Alimentary Canal.-L. Herrmann found in a loop of intestine, separated in the manner of Thiry and Vella, that at the end of some weeks it became filled with bacteria, cellular dWbris, and often fat, the whole mass having a fa3cal appearance. He con siders it probable therefore that the intestinal secretion and walls may furnish a portion of the excrements. Both J. R. Bradford and J. N. Langley have published memoirs on the physiology of gland nerves. The electrical changes in the human skin depen dent on the secretion of sweat have been investigated by J. Tarchanoff. Observations, chiefly of a histological nature, on secreting glands, especially the salivary glands, have been pub lished by 0. Diasch. These observations relate to the minute changes occurring on secretion; occurring either spontaneously or as the result of electrical stimulation; and E. Gley has investi gated the question of the inhibition of excito-secretory nervous impulses. J. N. Langley has shown that it is possible to preserve the mucous granules in mucous glands by means of osmic acid vapour. T. W. Shore and H. Lewis Jones, in investigating the vertebrate liver in a series of animals, find that, in the lowest vertebrate (amphioxus), the organ is a compound tubular gland; the solid anastomosing rods of the lamprey's liver form the next stage in development; penetration of blood channels between these leads to the condition found in fishes and reptiles; and a still finer penetration of blood vessels, and further subdivision of the hepatic cylinders leads to the condition found in the mam malian adult. Calorimetry.-J. Rosenthal has published three long and'ex haustive papers on calorimetry; the animals investigated were placed under varying conditions, and the numerical results are given in tables. The reader interested in the subject will find these papers in Du Bois 1eymond's Archiv. Blood.-The literature of the blood has been enriched this year by the publication of a large volume of original investigation (Du Sang) by GE. Hayem; the chief points of interest in the book re late to the formed elements, and the author's views of the origin of the blood tablets are fully explained. A number of hmemacyto metric observations are published by A. Giurber; his observations were carried out in frogs. An estimate of the total amount of blood in the animal's body being also made by Welcker's method, the data for the total number of corpuscles in the body were ob tained; they were found in round numbers to vary from .500.000,000 to 1,100,000,000. Cells.-An excellent account of the most recent doctrines con cerning cell division has been published by Waldeyer, and is trans lated by Dr. Benham in the current volume of the Quarterly Journalfor Microscopical Science. C. S. Sherrington and C. A. Ballance have together written a paper on the formation of scar tissue; they show that the important cell element in the forma tion of new connective tissue is not the leucocyte as taught by the Cohnheim school, but certain large tissue cells, which they term plasma cells. Respiration.-H. Head shows that if an animal is breathing rhythmically, the first effect of a permanent increase or decrease in the volume of the lungs is to cause the abolition of rhythmic breathing. If the lungs are inflated, the inspiratory muscles re main in a condition of complete elongation. If, on the other hand, they are diminished in volume, the inspiratory muscles become tonically contracted. But in either case, provided the advent of dyspncea be averted, the centre ultimately adapts itself to the per manently increased or diminished volume of the lungs, and the breathing again becomes rhythmic. When this adaptation has oc curred the normal zero is altered. Assuming that the centre is adapted to a certain volume A, and subsequently to a greater vol ume B, then collapse to the volume A, which previously produced no effect on the centre, acts as a strong inspiratory stimulus. At the present day there are a large number of complex machines for performing artificial respiration, which have replaced the simple bellows used in the early days of phy siological experiment. One of the latest of these is figured and described by J. Rosenthal in Du Bois 1Reymond's Archiv, and it is apparently well adapted, to judge by the tracings taken with it in use, for the end it has in view. Circulation.-The sphygmograph has been studied in a new light by J. L. Hoorweg, who, by means of mathematical measure ments of the curves, arrives at conclusions respecting the rate of blood flow, the amount of blood pressure, and the amount of work done by the different parts of the vascular'system. Von Kries has 6</page><page sequence="10">1442 THE BRITISB MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28, 1889. introduced a new gas tachograph, and Basch's sphygmomano meter has been employed in a series of experiments by Potain, who does-not regard it as such a valuable instrument as its inventor does. A new plethysmograph, applicable to the frog, has been invented by J. Katzenstein. McWilli'tm has published in the JOURNAL (January and February, 1889) a number of important observations relating to cardiac physiology and pathology. MEDICAL CHEMISTRY.

ALBUMINS.-Michailoff has recently shown that albumins are acid and globulins basic compounds. The first phase of the gelatinisation of albumins is the result of hydration, but subse quently the changes are rather the result of more or less com plete dehydration. Myosin is probably, as Halliburton has suggested, a chemical compound formed by the interaction of one or more myosinogens and a ferment. Chittenden and Cummins find ammonic chloride solutions the most useful for extracting myosin from flesh. When the salt is afterwards separated by dialysis the myosin is obtained in a jelly-like condition. An interesting paper upon the products of the action of super heated steam onfibrin has been published by Neumeister,to which we can only refer the reader.' In some recent examinations of commercial peptones by Konig and Kisch, Kiihne and Chittenden's method was adopted of pre cipitating the albuminoses with a saturated solution of ammonic sulphate, and precipitating from another portion both albuminose and peptone by sodic phosphotungstate, the peptone being esti mated from the difference. About 10 grammes are taken, boiled in water, and filtered, and the nitrogen in the precipitate on the filter then determined by Kjeldahl's process, the weight obtained multiplied by 6.25, giving the albumin. The filtrate is next made up to 500 cubic centim6tres, of which 100 cubic centimetres are evaporated down to a small bulk, 100 cubic centimetres of cold saturated solution of ammonic sulphide added to it, and the pre cipitate obtained dried and weighed. Another 100 cubic centi metres are next acidified with sulphuric acid and precipitated with an acid solution of sodic phosphotungstate, the pre cipitate washed with dilute sulphuric acid, and its nitrogen determined.2 In the white of egg, according to Corin and Berard, there are two kinds of proteids, those coagulable by heat, and peptones. In the former three, members of the albumin class coagulating at different temperatures are described, and two belonging to the globulin class precipitable by saturation with magnesic sulphate. The peptones increase as the eggs become stale.3 There are probably two forms of sulphur present in proteids, one loosely and the other firmly combined; and, according to Danilewsky, the latter may be divided into four varieties, accord ing to their removability by , 2, 5, or IO per cent. solutions of caustic soda. In white of egg the total sulphur was 1.66 and the loosely-bound 0.44, or as 4 to 1.006; while in fibrin the propor tions are 1.2 and 0.38, or as 3 to 0.95. Legumin and casein are examples of native proteids in which all the sulphur is apparently firmly combined. Kiruger has examined the proteid that has undergone treatment with caustic potash. He found it an amorphous peptone-like body, which was separable into two substances by saturation with ammonic sulphate, the one pre cipitate giving the reactions of an albumose and the other those of a peptone.4 To estimate the proteids, particularly in milk, the following method may be followed: Tannic acid precipitates all the pro teids completely, but the precipitate must not be washed with hot water or spirit, as it is partially soluble in both reagents. Albumoses are thrown down only in part, and peptones are soluble in excess of the tannic acid. Phosphomolybdic acid acts somewhat similarly, except that the precipitation of the albu moses and peptone is more complete. By saturating the milk with ammonic sulphate all the proteids except peptone are thrown down; but no peptone is present in the filtrate, as can be shown by the absence of any precipitate after the addition to it of tannic acid, and by no biuret reaction being given by it. A method recommended as the most accurate for quantitative determinations of proteids is that of estimating the total nitrogen in the tannic acid precipitate and multiplying this by 6.37 to get the total proteid. To separate the casein and lactalbumin and leave all the albumin in solution, precipitation by magnesie sul phate was found the most effective. Sodic chloride also precipi tates all the casein. To estimate the albumin, after separation of the casein, by boiling the filtrate hps been found very incom plete (Sebelien).5 CARBOHYDRATES,-A good starch solution for use in volumetric analyses with iodine may be made by mixing 5 grammes potato starch with 0.001 gramme mercuric iodide, stirring up with a little water, and then pouring the mixture into one litre of boiling water. A solution thus prepared may be kept for a long time., Albertoni has made a series of experiments on men and animals so as to determine the action of such carbohydrates as the sugars on the economy; and he shows their ingestion is followed by a quickening of the pulse and an increase of the blood pressure; the blood vessels also are enlarged, so that when cut about double the normal quantity of1blood flows from them. He therefore concludes that their effect on the action of the heart is of much importance.7 FOODS AND DIGESTION.-The generally received opinion as to the proteids required by a healthy man is that at least 100 to 120' grammes should be ingested daily. This, however, is opposed to the conclusions lately arrived at by Hirschfield, according to which it is possible for a healthy adult to maintain his body weight as well as his nitrogenous balance on 30 to 35 grammes daily of proteid, corresponding to 5.8 grammes of nitrogen. These experiments, however, only lasted for a short time (ten to fifteen days), so it is impossible to regard the conclusions drawn as de cisive." Some experiments' of Randnitz on the digestibility of boiled milk are interesting as showing that the nitrogen is always assimilated better when the milk is fresh than after being boiled, but that little difference is produced upon the assimilation of the fat.' A paper of Vieth's gives the results of nearly 85,000 analyses of milk. The specific gravity rarely falls outside 1030 to 1034. The determination consisted in that of the total solids, the non 2 Zeit. Annal. Chem., xxviii, 191. 3 Archiv. d. Biol., ix, 1. 4 Pffizqer's Archiv, xliii, 244. 7eit. Physiol.

The non-fatty contain about six-twelfth parts of milk sugar, one-twelfth part ash, and five-twelfth pro teids, about two-thirds of which are casein. The best milk is that obtained in November, and the evening milk is richer than that of the morning.10 In a man fed with beans for three days, together with a little fat, meal, salt, vinegar and beer, it was found by Pausnitz that, so far as the nutrition of the body is concerned, beans compare most unfavourably with other forms of vegetable food."1 Stift finds, as the result of his experiments with saccharin, that it interferes with digestion on account of its tendency to delay the ferment actions of which digestion essentially consists.12 Girard found by injecting sodium chloride into the rectum he increased both the amount of the gastric juice and the percentage of hydrochloric acid, the pepsin also being apparently in creased; but the same results did not follow the injection of other chlorides.13 The most generally accepted theory as to the origin of hydro chloric acid in the gastric juice is that the lactic acid formed from the carbohydrates sets hydrochloric acid free by acting on the sodium chloride. Now acidity tends to stop fermentation pro cesses, and in experiments with artificial gastric juice Cohn has found that, while pepsin itself appears to favour acetic or lactic acid fermentation, this is hindered by even traces of hydrochloric acid; the artificial gastric juice containing both bodies likewise hinders it, but not so powerfully as the acid alone; in the presence of peptone, however, no hindrance of the fermentation is produced at all.14 A new method has been proposed for estimating free hydro chloric acid in the stomach contents. These are evaporated to drynesswith baric carbonate, and then incinerated, by which means the organic salts are burnt, the baric chloride present being un changed. The latter salt is then extracted with water, and the dissolved barium titrated by the addition of potassic bichromate. The standard solution of the latter is best made of such a strength that each cubic centimetre corresponds to 4.05 milligrammes of hydrochloric acid. When it is added to the barium solution, a precipitate insoluble in water and acetic acid is formed, the yellow colour which appears with the smallest excess of the bichromate being the indicator of the end of the reaction.1" Harris and Tooth state that the presence of micro-organisms is not necessary for gastric digestion; and their experiments to prove that micro-organisms are competent of themselves to con vert proteids into peptones proved unsatisfactory, albumoses only appearing, never true peptones. They also found that tryptic ferment can convert proteids into peptone without the assistance of micro-organisms. The formation of indole is vari able, and can be easily prevented by the addition of the smallest amount of phenol or mercuric chloride; it would seem to be de rived from the peptone, and not from leucin or tyrosin.1c According to the experiments of Ellenberger and Hofmeister, with horses and pigs fed on starchy food, there is always a vari able quantity of sugar to be found in the stomach and intestines; in the stomach of the horse they have found as much as 30 to 150 grammes, constituting from 1 to 3.5 per cent. of sugar, and in that of the pig from 0.6 to 0.8 per cent. The largest amount of sugar is present an hour to an hour and a half after a meal ; the pre sence of much hydrochloric acid stops the conversion of starch into sugar, the latter being also affected by the cooked or un cooked condition of the starch. These results are opposed to those of Seegen, who has made special reference to the small pro portion of sugar to be found in the intestinal tract; the authors are of opinion that Seegen probably killed his animals too late, that is, three hours and a half to eighteen hours after a meal.'7 Potato starch is converted in the human stomach into dextrin and maltose, part remaining unaltered. When eggs and water had been previously ingested the soluble starch is changed in some unknown way, but no sugar is formed."8 Ott proved that the stomach has the power of changing peptone into serum albumin. Popoff found in her experiments that in a tortoise's heart a standstill is soon produced when a peptone formed by gastric juice is made the circulating fluid; but that if this peptone had been previously kept in the stomach or intes tine of a living dog for fitteen minutes, the heart continued to, beat. The same results, however, were not obtained with pan creatic peptone.19 According to Brinck, various forms of animal cells appear likewise to possess this power. - Some recent quantitative experiments of Limbourg have only: confirmed what has been the general belief as to the bile exerting an antiputrefactive action on the alimentary canal in virtue of the biliary acids it contains.20 TISSUES AND ORGANS.-From some recent experiments or Ewald's it would appear that an elastic fibre consists of two sub stances, both of which are digestible by trypsin and pepsin at 40? C., one refracting light strongly and being readily soluble in cold acid pepsin solutions, and the other insoluble.21 In the matrix of tracheal cartilage, MIorner finds a mucin body,' differing from ordinary mucin in not being so stringy, and which when treated with alkalies yields an albuminate, a peptone-like' substance and chondroitic acid; collagen, yielding g9latin on boiling; chondroitic acid, which appears to be free, and to be the body originally described by Krukenberg as a hyalin, and which on treatment with dilute mineral acids yields a reducing sugar; and a very soluble form of proteid which is not present in young cartilage.22 Section of the nerve of a muscle produces a pathological con dition in which its metabolism is altered by a tendency to accu mulation therein of glycogen.23 With regard to sarcolactic acid, it was found by Gleiss that the quickly contracting muscles of the frog became acid more rapidly and extensively than the slowly contracting muscles of the tortoise; and this rule appeared to hold good throughout the animal kingdom, the more active muscles always being the more acid; but no difference could be noted between the pale and red muscles in rigor mortis.24 K. B. Lehmann has placed horseflesh in a flask and exposed it to the continuous action of a stream of pure water. At the end of seven months the fatty acids had doubled as compared with those present in a similar piece of beef preserved for a similar time in alcohol.25 Blood.-To estimate the alkalinity of the blood, Haycraft and Williamson prepared a series of red litmus papers, acidified with oxalic acid, and glazed by being dipped in paraffin oil. A single drop of blood exercises a neutralising effect after a short interval has elapsed. The amount of alkali which will turn the litmus paper blue is known, and in this way an approximation is made.26 In the living blood no lactic acid is usually tobefound; but if the blood is allowed to stand some hours before beino examined, or if the examination is made after death, then lactic acid may readily be detected. If, therefore, lactic acid is formed during life, its oxi dation must be very rapid. Peptones are not present in the blood, even during active diges tion, as they are rapidly transformed during, or immediately after, absorption into blood proteids, as is generally believed, or into certain nitrogenous non-proteids. As the result of some experi ments, Torup concludes that if a certain quantity of blood is re moved from an animal which is then left to starve, an increase of the blood proteids occurs, an increase not merely relative but also absolute. The number of the red corpuscles is augmented, a slight increase likewise manifesting itself in the proteids of the serum, which is specially marked in fibrin. Here the increase cannot be said to be due to the absorbed peptones.27 The following salts, even when added to saturation, produce no precipitation of the serum proteids: potassic sulphate, nitrate, and chloride; ammonic chloride, nitrate, and acetate; magnesic chloride, nitrate, and acetate. A certain amount of precipitation, more or less complete, was caused by potassic chloride and ace tate; sodic chloride, sulphate, nitrate, chlorate, phosphate, and acetate; and magnesic sulphate. Lewith also gives the results of his quantitative estimations of the amount of salt required to pro duce the precipitation of the two proteids of serum.25 Later on, 19 Archiv.f.

He found that as a rule the purgative powers, difficulty of diffu sion, and power of precipitating globulins, run together in these and similar salts. In the stroma of mammalian red corpuscles Halliburton and Friend detected only the globulin coagulating at 750. It has fibrino-plastic properties, being identical, probably, with fibrine ferment. No nuclein or nucleo-albumin was present.29 Mazet has modified with advantage Hoppe-Seyler's method for the preparation of crystalline haemoglobin. The defibrinated blood is first washed with 14 times its volume of a solution of sodic sulphate (2.5 per cent.), the washed corpuscles placed in a special vessel with a stop-cock at the bottom, and there mixed with their own volume of water, and then with ether, or better, with benzene; the mixture is shaken for a short time, and then kept at a low temperature for twenty-four hours. A layer of hsmoglobin solution separates, which is drawn off and gradually mixed with one-fifth its volume of pure absolute alcohol. The filtrate is cooled to -14?, and afterwards remelted. By draining the imperfect crystals thus obtained, and redissolving them in a little water at 350, again adding alcohol and cooling as before, good crystals are obtained.30 In the red corpuscles the pigment takes the place of protoplasm in the cell, instead of being mixed with it, and in their high per centage of solids they also differ from animal cells. According to Hoppe-Seyler a distinction must be drawn between the pigment in the corpuscles and the haemoglobin aeparated from the corpuscles. For these pigments as they exist in the corpuscles the names arterin and phlebinare suggested,and they are probablycompounds of hmemoglobin and oxyhiemoglobin respectively, with lecithin. The pigments as they exist in, the corpuscles are insoluble, while the separated hvemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin are soluble, in the blood plasma and serum. In the corpuscles the pigments do not crystallise,give off oxygen in vacuo, and decompose hydric peroxide, which is not the case with the separated heemoglobin. Again, a weak solution of potassic ferricyanide has no action on the com bined pigment, while oxyhiemoglobin is thus changed into met hbomoglobin. In spectroscopic appearance, however, both bodies correspond, but this does not prove they are the same, for in dif ferent animals the heemoglobins have not the same percentage composition, solubility, or crystalline form, yet they all have the same spectrum.31 Hermann states that the spectrum of reduced haemoglobin, generally described as consisting of only one band, consists of two, the second being a narrow band nearly coincident with the D line. In' connection with haemoglobin, Hermann has also shown that in hunger it is less quickly used up than the other solids of the blood.32 When pure protoplasm, such as the blood corpuscles of the horse or bullock, or the lymph corpuscles of the spleen or lym phatic glands, is 'placed in contact with pure crystalline haemo globin, methsemoglobin is first formed, and, later, the haemoglobin is completely destroyed. A gradual reformation of hemoglobin and methaemoglobin, however, occurs, so that at the end of a fortnight more is present than was there originally.33 The tension of oxygen in blood and in solutions of hiemoglobin has received attention from Hufner, and he gives a table recording his results. To render breathing possible at high altitudes, the best means would appear to be to increase the hemoglobin in the blood.34 Lowit states that the blood tablets of mammalian blood seem not to be present in the blood of birds, amphibians, reptiles, or fishes. These tablets consist chiefly of globulin, and he regards them as fibrin precursors. In the blood of batrachians and birds, the spindle cells found are regarded by him as varieties of white corpuscles, and not as the equivalents of blood tablets.35 In carbonic oxide poisoning, if the blood is diluted with 50 volumes of water, and to 100 cubic centimetres of this 0.2 cubic centimetre yellow ammonic sulphide, and 0.3 per cent. acetic acid (30 per cent) are added and gently mixed, a bright red colora tion is produced, normal blood only giving a greenish grey.36 Liver.-Girard has published a valuable table showing the per centage of sugar and glycogen at certain periods after death, and the figures indicate an increase in the sugar, and a corresponding decreasein the glycogen. The power of the hepatic cells to change glycogen into sugar is not destroyed after death, but the presence of blood in the liver assists in the process. Muscles, also, which contain glycogen possess the same power, for their glycogen is likewise converted into sugar.37 Suprarenals.-The extract of these bodies has been known for several years to possess a poisonous nature, but upon what this depends was unknown. Marino-Zuco has found that when the extract is rendered acid or alkaline in reaction the toxic power disappears. Neurine and certain organic phosphatic acids were also discovered in this extract; and Marino-Zuco further noted that if a mixture of these organic phosphatic acids is saturated with neurine, the liquid obtained possesses the poisonous proper ties of the original extract, even when very dilute; but the action of acids or alkalies destroys the combination, and thus re moves the poisonous properties. Neurine orthophosphate, pre pared synthetically, was also found very poisonous.38 Kidneys.-The percentage composition of healthy as compared with waxy kidneys is here shown: Healthy. Waxy. Albumin ............. 1.116 to 1.394 ............ 0.792 Globulin ............ 8.633.to 9.225 ............ 5.553 Other proteids ......... 1.436 to 1.598 ............ 0.485 Gelatin ............. 0.996 to 1.849 ............ 2.685 Albuminoids ............ - . ............ 0.992 (38) U.=Nz.-In our last report will be found a short abstract of some of the recent work as to the presence of carbohydrates in normal urine. It is probable that a mixture of two carbohydrates is present, as part is soluble in caustic soda, and gives the re actions of animal gum; while the insoluble residue dissolves in alcohol and gives the grape sugar reactions.40 Leube, however, states that he has been unable to detect any carbohydrate in healthy urine, but that in diabetic urines he has discovered glycogen in varying quantity.41 To detect sugar in urine add 1 to 2 cubic centimetres plumbic acetate to 10 cubic centimetres urine, and filter- mix 5 cubic centimatres of the filtrate with an equal quantity of normal potash solution and a drop or two of phenyl hydrazine, then shake well and boil: when sugar is present the liquid becomes yellow in colour, and on the addition of acetic acid in excess is rendered opaque, a finely divided yellow precipitate being thrown down.42 Another delicate test is also here given: When 5 cubic centimetres of aqueous safranin solution (? per cent.) are heated in a test tube with 1 cubic centimetre urine containing grape sugar, and 2 or 3 cubic centimetres soda solution (10 per cent.) added, the safranin is reduced and the solution rendered colourless; but the colour rapidly reappears at the surface owing to reoxidation.43 Besides sugar other substances occur in urine which reduce alkaline solutions of cupric oxide, such as uric acid and kreatinin, and the glycuronic acid compounds. The latter are much in creased by the administration of camphor, chloral hydrate, phenyl, benzoic acid, etc. The glycuronic acid is probably derived from certain changes, possibly putrefactive, occurring in the proteids in the intestine. Hagemann in his paper likewise refers to certain practical difficnlties in the use of Fehling's solution. He found, however, that the addition of a small quantity of calcic chloride prevented the mechanical separation of cuprous oxide, and that in case the filtrate is to be tested for copper at the end of the reaction, it is necessary to filter rapidly, and to test the first two drops that pass, owing to the rapid reoxidation of the reduced oxide.44 To render the exact point of decolori3ation more easily seen in the above Fehling reaction Causse suggests the addition of 4 cubic centimbtres of a 5 per cent. solution of potassic ferrocyanide and 20 cubic centimetres water to each 10 cubic centimetres Fehling's solution. The ferrocyanide dissolves the cuprous oxide as rapidly as it is precipitated, and thus maintains a colourless solution.45 Volatile fatty acids are formed in the ammoniacal fermentation of sugar, as Salkowski has shown. The distillates of two urines were compared, one of which was fresh when distilled with strong 37 P/fliqger's Archiv, xli, 294. 38 Gazetta, xviii, 199. 39 Compt. Rend. Soc. Biol., v. 51. 40 Zeit.

As a mean of eight analyses the distillate of 300 cubic centimetres of the fresh urine contained acid equiva lent to 2 cubic centim5etres of standard alkali, and the ammoniacal urine acid equivalent to 12.2 cubic centim5etres of the same. The amount of volatile acid per day would therefore be equal to nearly 0.15 gramme acetic acid in fresh, and to 0.915 gramme in putrid urine. The acidity is not due to carbonic acid, but appears to be owing to the presence of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids.46 Camerer proposes the following as an accurate process for the estimation of uric acid. To the urine of the twenty-four hours is added some soda solution (1 to 2 grammes in the litre of water) to precipitate the phosphates, and water is added to bring the spe cific gravity to about 1010; 50 cubic centimetres magnesia mix ture (mag. sulph. 1, ammonic chloride 2, ammonia 4, and water 8) are added to 300 cubic centimetres of the urine mixture, and the precipitate removed by ifitration. To a measured amount of the filtrate some finely-divided calcium carbonate is added, and then about 5 cubic centimetres of a silver nitrate solution (3 per cent). In the precipitate, when collected on a filter and washed and dried, the nitrogen is determined by Kjeldahl's method, and from this the uric acid is calculated.47 Salkowski, in a recent paper, criticises the silver process for the determination of uric acid, and he reaffirms his original statement that the method is a bad one, the error in analysis averaging 3 to 60 per cent.48 In diseased conditions of the body where there are abnormal putrefactive changes, an increased proportion of such aromatic substances as phenol, cresol, indol, etc., makes its appearance in the urine. In erysipelas and py&amp;emia, putrefactive processes are undoubtedly often present. Benger lately classed scarlet fever and diphtheria with pysimia, regarding them all as putrefactive. Benger's method consisted in weighing the phenol as tribromo phenol, but this has been found by Haldane to be wanting in accuracy, for the more concentrated the urine the greater is the quantity of tribomo-phenol to be obtained from it. Indeed, the increase in phenol described by Benger as occurring in scarlet fever and diphtheria is susceptible of an easy explanation by the increased specific gravity of the urine in these diseases. The method adopted was to estimate the proportion of sulphuric acid combined as ethereal sulphates, and to compare it with that com bined as ordinary sulphate. The normal proportion is about as 1 to 10, while in 16 cases of scarlatina it was as 1 to 17 in the urine passed during the fever; and in 13 cases it was 1 to 21 in the urine passed in the first three days of convalescence. In diphtheria the ratio was 1 to 13. There does not, therefore, ap pear to be any ground for regarding scarlet fever or diphtheria as being analogous to putrefactive processes.49 Gumbert confirms Jaffe's opinion that urobilin does not pre exist as such in the urine, but is formed from some chromogen body by oxidation. To detect it, he mixes the urine with an equal volume of fuming hydrochloric acid, heats the mixture up to boiling point, then lets it cool and shakes with ether. The ether becomes of a pale brownish-red colour, with a well-marked green fluorescence, giving the absorption band of urobilin with the spectroscope, and leaving behind a red residue on evaporation, which forms a fluorescent solution in chlorofarm and a non fluorescent one in alcohol, glycerol, and acetone. When the ethereal solution is shaken with an alkali, the latter is coloured deep red, but when fresh ether is added and an excess of acid, a yellowish solution is obtained, which is fluorescent, and gives the urobilin absorption band.50 Some work has been done by S. Sher to estimate the relation between the total sulphuric acid of the urine and that existing as ethereal sulphates in rest and work. It was found that the total sulphuric acid, as well as the ethereal sulphates, were less during rest, and that the ratio between the two was less during rest than work, the only exceptions being when the work was excessive and exhausting.

He further states that trypsin is to be found in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of different animals.5" Salkowski is of opinion that the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen from urine is due to the action of bacteria on the neutral compounds of sulphuric acid present in the urine. He found, for example, when nutritive solutions containing suitable triosul phates were inoculated with urine already containing sulphuretted hydrogen, that large quantities of the gas were given off ; a similar experiment with sulphates showed the same result. Part of the sulphur taken in the form of flowers of sulphur is absorbed, he states, and this goes to form sulphuric acid.52 According to Bohland 15.54 per cent. of the nitrogen of urine is not combined as urea, of which 0.065 exists as preformed am monia. The nitrogen in the extractives precipitable by phos photungstic acid forms 6.51 per cent. of the whole.'3 In esti mating the total nitrogen of urine by Kjeldahl's method it should be remembered that when ptomaines are present serious errors are likely to arise.54 PTOMAINRs.-Wyborn, by macerating some finely-minced beef with twice its weight of water, and exposing it in the sunlight for sixteen days, then straining and precipitating with an equal volume of absolute alcohol, washing with boiling alcohol, and finally drying in warm air, obtained a ptomaine product without the use of acid. The residue formed 0.067 per cent. of the original beef. When treated with a mixture of equal volumes of glycerol and water an amber-coloured solution and a brown precipitate were 6btained. After the solution had been kept a month sub cutaneous injections of 5 minims, containing X grain of residue, were made with mice, and proved fatal in about an hour. Peptones and cadaveric alkaloids were present.55 The ptomaines and leucomaines have a similar chemical consti tution to meta- and para-phenylenediamines, and accordingly, the physiological action of the latter possesses much interest. When administeredin the proportion of 0.1 gramme to each kilo. of body weight, salivation, vomiting, diarrhoea, increased diuresis, and coma are produced by both bodies, death ensuing in two to three hours with the para-compound, and in fifteen hours with the meta-compound. They remove the oxygen from the blood and tissues, and a dark tint is imparted to these and the brownish products formed. In dogs, severe influenza symptoms, accom panied by constant sneezing and cough, ending in coma and death, are caused by the meta-compound; and a very remarkable exophthalmia with complete alteration of the tissues of the eye results from the para-phenylenediamines.56 REsPIRATIONS, OXID.ATIONS, ETC.-Brown-S6quard and d'Arson val in a previous paper showed that the expired air contains some body that possesses highly poisonous properties. They have con tinued their investigations, and have placed rabbits in a series of air-tight cages, so arranged that the air entering at one end passes right through; the animal, therefore, in the eighth cage, breathing an atmosphere loaded with the respiratory products of the seven others, only the rabbit in the first cage breathing pure air. All the rabbits, with the exception of those in the first two cages, die rapidly, in the last three cages two or three days being sufficient; but if a rabbit that is nearly dead is removed from the cage, it generally recovers after a considerable time. The carbonic anhydride in the second cage is muchbelow 1 per cent., and in the last it averages only about 3 per cent. So far as carbonic an hydride itself is concerned,the authors found that men can breathe without much discomfort or any permanent bad effect air contain ing 20 per cent. of this gas. If before the airfrom the sixth chamber enters the next, it is passed through tubes containing beads moistened with sulphuric acid, the poison is removed, but not the 51 Pfl'iiger's Archiv, xli, 148. 52 Berlin klin.

[Dec. 28,1889. carbonic anhydride, and the rabbits in the seventh and eighth chambers continue to live without inconvenience, while the rabbit in the sixth chamber soon dies. The injurious effect of expired air is chiefly due, therefore, to the presence of some pulmonary poison, and not to carbonic anhydride.57 Nasse speaks of the oxidation which occurs in the blood and fluid of the body when neutral oxygen combines with some readily oxidisable matter, such as direct oxidation; that occurring chiefly in the body, where some fermentative action so alters the complex molecules as to render them readily oxidisable, as primary oxida tion; and that in which the oxidation affects metabolic products, formed by other than oxidation processes, as secondary oxidatzon. When fats are oxidised in the system, secondary oxidation processes are furthered, as shown by the increase in the amount of ethereal hydrogen sulphates, and the decrease in the glycuronic acid in the urine.58 It has been the generally accepted opinion that more carbonic anhydride is produced in the light than in the darkness. That light exerts some indirect effect on animals with a normal central nervous system is very probable, some reflex effect being produced, possibly through the optic nerves or the sensory nerves of the skin; but a series of experiments made by Loeb incline to the conclusion that the light really causes no increase in the ordinary oxidation processes of the body.39 The ingestion of saline material has been shown by Loewy to exercise an influence on the gaseous metabolism. Rabbits and glauber salts were used in the experiments, and experiments were also made on men. An increase in the gaseous exchanges in the lungs was noticed to occur when the sodic sulphate was adminis tered, not only the carbonic anhydride exhaled being increased but also the oxygen absorbed. The increased metabolism is pro bably the result of the increased activity of the intestinal muscles, and probably to a less extent of the glands.60 Marker and others have stated that about 48 per cent. of the *ater ingested by animals is discharged in the form of vapour. Henneberg, however, who has been working at this subject, denies this entirely, as he found that in sheep 61.92 per cent., and in oxen 83 to 93 per cent. of the whole water ingested is ex creted in the dung and urine. The percentages, therefore, for water discharged in the form of vapour are 25.8 for sheep and 12.6 for cattle."1 The synthetical processes occurring in the animal organism form, the subject of a very interesting paper by Pfluiger. The formation of glycogen by the liver is referred to, not only carbo hydrates, glycerol, gelatin, but also proteids acting as sources; and Mering's researches on phloridzen are referred to, in which dia betes was produced by its administration, all the carbohydrate material in the body being discharged in a few days in the urine as sugar; an enormous quantity of sugar being also similarly dis charged by the same animals if the drug was again administered after an interval of a few days' starvation. Whether the well known " economy theory " offers a satisfactory explanation of the formation of glycogen after the administration of glycerol and like substances; or that the result depends on a stimulation of the liver it is still difficult to say, although the question here receives attention.62 Keller has made a series of careful experiments upon himself, lasting over a week, upon the influence of ethyl alcohol on the tissue metabolism. The daily food consisted of 500 grammes of meat, 400 grammes of bread, 100 grammes of butter, 1,500 cubic eentimetres of spring water, and 2 grammes of common salt. With this, on the fourth day, 150 cubic centimetres of ethyl alcohol (96 per cent.) were given. The urine was carefully analysed, and it was found that alcohol acts as a diuretic, and that the ex cretion of nitrogen was slightly lessened on the first day of the administration of the alcohol, due probably to the disturbing adtion of the alcohol on absorption and digestion, but slightly in creased afterwards. A slight increase also showed itself in the phosphoric acid and chlorine, but the duration of the experi ment was too short to enable any positive conclusions to be drawn."3 Aldehoff, in his experiments on the influence of starvation on the glycogen in liver and muscle, estimates the glycogen by Kultz's method, that is, by extraction with hot potash, separation of the proteids by hydrochloric acid and potassio-mercuric iodide, and the precipitation of the glycogen by alcohol. According to him the glycogen disappears in starvation from the cardiac and striated muscles more slowly than from the liver-a statement in opposition to Luchsinger, but in accordance with Weiss. In some recent investigations of E. Voit there was distinct evidence of the formation of glycogen from the carbohydrates. This is, therefore, opposed to the " economy theory," according to which the whole of the glycogen in the body is formed from proteids.6' When jaundice is produced mechanically the glycogenic func tion also appears to be somewhat diminished, and this slight modification may help to explain the symptoms in certain cases where tlte jaundice has a mechanical cause. 6 The mineral constituents of milk and of the fcetal tissues are generally present in the same proportion, but with some differ ences. When the ash, say of dog's milk, is compared with the ash of the foetal tissues of a dog, the former is found to be rather richer in potash and poorer in soda; the percentage present in the milk is only one-sixth of that in the foetal tissues, while that of the chlorine in the milk is double that in the tissues. The body is found to contain less and less iron as the age advances, for more iron is given by the placenta to the young animal than by the milk; and it is probable that this large quantity of iron given by the mother is not directly derived from the food taken during pregnancy, but that a storage up of iron in the maternal organs, beginning probably before ithe first conception, is of constant oc currence, which might explain the frequent appearance of chlorosis about the age of puberty.66 In the report of the committee appointed by the Clinical Society to investigate the disease known as myxoedema, the average of ten analyses only showed a percentage of mucin equal to 0.374 per cent., approximately the same as in normal adult skin. In the case of certain of the organs a moderate increase was observed, particularly in the tendons, and specially those of the heart. In the case originally examined by Charles, the amount of mucin was greatly in excess of that present in normal skin; and although in the cases since examined by him he has never found so much mucin, in some, indeed, no marked increase being perceptible, yet it appears to him if the examination were made in the earlier stages of the disease, it might be possible to detect a greater pre ponderance of the mucin.

The Gastritis of Phthisis.-Digestive derangements such as anorexia, epigastric discomfort, and vomiting, not infrequently form some of the most troublesome symptems with which the practical physician has to deal in cases of pulmonary phthisis. And while the clinical aspect of dyspepsia in phthisis has been the subject of more or less attention from Rosenthal, Klemperer, and others, the question from the standpoint of pathological ana tomy has been somewhat neglected. The only monograph of im portance that has appeared since the older writings of Louis, Wilson Fox, Fenwick, and others, is by Margan,' in France, who has in many respects given an able account of the subject both from a clinical and from a pathological point of view. The most recent contribution is from the pen of Dr. Schwalbe,2 who, bear ing in mind the importance of post-mortem changes,3 took the precaution to remove the stomach in his twenty-five cases very shortly after death (generally 1 to 2, never more than 5 hours after). He was thus able not only to study more satisfactorily the naked-eye appearances, but also to enhance considerably the value of his histological investigations. In each case he examined the fresh tissue microscopically, and removed portions from different regions of the stomach for subsequent histological in vestigation. In only two cases did he meet with dilatation of the stomach, and he considers that ectasia ventricidli mnst be re garded as a rare complication of phthisis. As to the state of the mucous membrane itself, except that it occasionally looked -slightly thickened and swollen, it presented in the great majority of the cases no morbid appearances worthy of note. The excep tions were one case in which amyloid infiltration was marked, and here the mucous membrane presented multiple but small erosions scattered over the surface. In another case it was de cidedly opaque and mottled in yellowish patches; in a third, tubercular ulceration was found near the pylorus. In no case was a thinning or atrophy of it met with, and only rarely was it noticed coated with tenacious mucous indicative of a catarrhal condition. The results of histological examination showed that in five the organ was normal, in fifteen interstitial gastritis was found, but for the most part slight or moderate in degree; of the remaining five cases, amyloid changes were found in one, both in the mucosa and submucosa, and marked parenchymatous degene ration of the glands in four. The interstitial gastritis was in variably in the form of a small-celled infiltration of the intertu bular stroma, and in no instance had it developed into fibrous tissue so as to cause atrophy of the mucosa. But in cases where it was more obvious, secondary changes in the tubules were also observed, namely, cystic dilatation and alterations in the epithe lial cells. Schwalbe maintains that it is only in cases where the tubules have undergone alterations in position, form, and size, that any definite pathological significance can be attached to the ac companying cellular changes. The four instances where the parenchymatous were the only changes noted must be regarded as ,examples of simple parenchymatous gastritis (Virchow), with ex tensive fatty degeneration of the cells. He was not able to trace a metamorphosis of the two kinds of cells one into the other (for example, the principal into the parietal, and vice versd); nor did he find a perceptible or constant diminution in the parietal or peptic cells, so that in this respect he does not confirm the results of other observers. Coming now to the important question, how far these structural changes are responsible for the functional disturbances, he differs materially from previous writers. He is of opinion that the interstitial gastritis which occurs in the later stages of phthisis is seldom of such extent or importance that any noteworthy impairment of function can be ascribed to it. It neverreaches the intensity of that atrophic form in which nearly all secretory power is lost as Fenwick, Ewald, Rosenheim and others have shown in idiopathic disease of the stomach. Even in the cases of simple parenchymatous gastritis it is doubtful whether the hydrochloric acid production is interfered with to any material degree, for in a case of acute yellow atrophy of the liver, where no diminution was noted, Rosenheim found exten sive fatty degeneration of the tubular glands. He has seen both parenchymatous and interstitial inflammation in persons who never complained of dyspeptic symptoms and, on the other hand, patients have complained severely of dyspeptic symptoms, in whose stomach there was little or no inflammatory change. Ac cordingly he holds that it is not possible to establish any con stant relation between the pathological conditions and the clinical signs. At the same time he does not state that such changes as he has described are entirely without effect, but believes other important factors must be taken into account to explain the dys peptic symptoms of phthisis. These are aniemia, nervous depres sion, atony of the stomach, and vitiation of taste from constant expectoration of foul sputum. Regarding the etiology of the gastritis, Schwalbe believes it develops in the later stages of phthisis during the formation of vomicee, and is to be attributed to the absorption of toxic substances resulting from the necrosing lung parenchyma, which enter the blood and set up a gastritis much in the same way as they may excite a nephritis. Gastro-intestinal Ulceration.-In sixteen cases where hiemor rhages, hcemorrhagic erosions, and ulcerations of var3ing degree were met with in the mucous membrane of the gastro-intestinal tract. Openchowski1 found hyaline degeneration of the walls of the blood vessels. His researches were conducted in the labora tory of IProfessor von Recklinghausen, who had also chanced to come across the same degeneration of the blood vessels in an early round ulcer of the stomach. So far as concerns the hemorrhages and hiemorrhagic erosions, two forms of hyaline degeneration were met with: (1) hyaline thrombosis of the vessels within the lumen, the thrombus lying separate from the vessel wall, and often surrounded by red blood cells, and (2) hyaline degeneration and swelling of the vessel walls themselves, affecting chiefly the middle coat. A favourite site was the point of division of the vessel where a knob-like swelling usually presented. The arterial branches were more frequently affected than the venous. As re gards the ulcers, the more fully developed they were, and the deeper the necrotic process, the less frequently blood vessels so affected were met with, but here, in the base of the ulcer, it seemed as if the perivascular connective tissue had undergone hyaline metamorphosis. In older ulcers the degenerative process was most pronounced at the periphery, possibly the hyaline necrotic tissue in the central part had been removed, or in cases of gastric ulcer had undergone artificial digestion. It is evident that grave disturbances of the circulation must follow upon the hyaline degeneration of the blood vessels, such as hoemorrhagic infiltration and erosion, which prepare the ground for the subse quent development of ulceration. But what are the conditions favouring the occurrence of hyaline degeneration? In anaemic, cachectic, or otherwise enfeebled subjects-especially if they are exposed to toxic influences-it is easy to suppose spasm and con traction of the vessels take place, whether of peripheral or of central origin. Such abnormal contraction may lead on the one hand to changes of a degenerative nature in the vessel wall, and on the other hand to temporary arrest of the circulation and stasis of the white blood corpuscles, which themselves may undergo the hyaline degeneration, and so form hyaline thrombi within the vessels. Embolism, whether produced experimentally or other wise, produces the same effects. Thus it would seem that Virchow's theory as to the causation of gastric ulcer is correct, the only point remaining to be explained being those general pathological conditions that tend to produce the disease of the walls of the blood vessels.. Arthritic Haemoptysis.-Sir Andrew Clark has called attention to the occurrence in elderly persons of h.emoptysis not due to tubercular or cardiac disease, and probably due to structural alterations in the terminal pulmonary blood vessels. He main tains that these vascular alterations occur in persons of the arthritic diathesis, resemble the vascular alterations found in osteo arthritic articulations, and are themselves of an arthritic nature.

In this country, where it is seldom possible to make post-mortem examination so soon after death, it is a good plan to pour into the stomach by means of a funnel and syphon, a quantity of metlsylated spirit to wlsich a little boroglyceride is added. This preserves portions of thlc stomach from post-mnortem changes, and at the necropsy a great part of the organ will be found suitable for histological investigation. 4 Zur pathologischen Anatomie der geschwiirigen Processe im Magenderm tractus, Firch.

[Dec. 28, 1889. published in thisJouRNAL, it will be sufficient to recall his opinion that this form of hmmoptysis usually subsides without the pro duction of further damage, and that it is best treated, not by astringents and the local application of cold, but by quiet, the re striction of liquid diet, the stilling of cough, and the use of calomel and salines, of alkalies with iodide of potassium, and in frequently repeated counter-irritation. Pericardial Effusion.-Though the number of cases in which pericardial effusion has been treated by tapping or incision is still small, the evidence of the justifiability of the operation continues to increase. M. Ferrierhas collectedtwenty-two cases5 of tubercular pericarditis thus treated; in two cases the operation was com pletely successful, and in the majority of the rest considerable benefit was obtained, though one case succumbed eight hours after the operation. He also collected nine cases of hemaorrhagic peri carditis, in which the operation had been performed, with five recoveries. Simple aspiration may be sufficient when the fluid is serous, but incision appears to be the better treatment when the collection is purulent. Sixteen cases of purulent pericarditis, treated by evacuation of pus, have been reported: of these, eleven were treated by puncture and all died, whereas, of five treated by incision and free drainage, three rec,vered. The operation should not be too long deferred, and M. T. Ferrier considers that it ought to be resorted to (1) when the exudation is dangerous, owing to its abundance (in case pleural effusion also exists, the latter should be first evacuated); (2) when, even if small in amount, it shows no tendency to subside, and from its chronic course exposes the heart to fatty degeneration; and (3) when the effusion is puru lent, and might give rise to septic conditions. Massage of the Heart.-A peculiar manipulation, to which he has applied the term " massage of the heart," has been recommended by Oertel in cases of cardiac insufficiency, whether due to weak ness of the heart muscle or to obstruction due to valvular disease, emphysema, or peripheral pressure where compensatory hyper trophy is not complete. The manipulation is thus performed: The masseur places his hands on either side of the chest of the patient, at the level of the fifth or sixth rib in the axillary line, and moves them forward and downward during expiration till the lower border of the seventh or eighth rib is reached, at the same time exerting pressure. This occupies the whole period of expiration, and is repeated witn each inspiration. The following inspiration is deeper, and to this much of the good effect claimed for the method must be attributed, since it must increase the negative thoracic pressure, but Oertel believes that some direct pressure is also exerted on the heart during the manipulation, and that the cardiac circulation is thus facilitated. The method should not be employed in recent cases of endo-, myo-, or pericarditis, nor where there is much arterial atheroma. Addison's Disease.-The most important recent contribution to our knowledge of Addison's disease was published by Dr. von Kahlden6 in 1888, too late for notice last year. He questions the truth of the widely accepted view that the complex train of sym ptoms of this disease is to be referred to primary or secondary changes in the semilunar ganglia. Two fatal cases happened to come under his notice, in which the clinical symptoms were so unequivocal that he was induced to study their pathological ana tomy with much care and minuteness. The affected adrenals were much enlarged, and the capsule of the organ was thickened. They presented a large caseous centre surrounded by a narrow greyish peripheral zone. Tubercle bacilli were found sparsely dis tributed in the caseous detritus in both cases. Histologically the capsule was thickened and fibrosed; the grey peripheral zone was the seat of small-celled infiltration, aggregated in closely set patches around dilated blood vessels; and no traces of the proper cellular structure were discernible. The histological changes found in the semilunar ganglia and the solar plexus in both cases varied in intensity in the individual ganglia: (1) pigmen tary atrophy of the ganglion cells; (2) proliferative endarteritis leading to obliteration of the vessels, affecting medium-sized arteries, thickening and small-celled infiltration of the perivascular connective tissue, especially around the veins, and occasionally hyaline degeneration of the walls of the smal'er arteries and capil laries; (3) general fibrous thickening of the capsule and of the connective tissue stroma, which here and there was the seat of blood extravasation and blood pigment; (4) perineuritis of the nerve bundles entering the periphery of the ganglia, but little alteration of the nerve fibres themselves. It is evident, therefore. in both these cases that the semilunar ganglia were the seat of important and more or less intense pathological changes, which must have gravely affected their function; and while they tend to confirm the view above mentioned, von Kahlden is careful to reserve any definite conclusions till a larger number of cases have been thoroughly investigated from this standpoint. He refers. especially to those cases described by Bell Fletcher and Aran, where the adrenals were unaffected, but other important changes were found in the neighbourhood of the semilunar ganglia. He emphasises also the following points: The symptoms of Addison's disease are far more frequently associated with tubercular dis ease than with other morbid conditions of the adrenals. Cancer of the adrenals has been observed to occur with out the classical symptoms of Addison's disease being present.. The progress of the disease may in all probability be referred less to the effects of pressure of the affected adrenals than to the influence of some irritant exerted in their immediate neighbour hood. At all events, the remarkable vascular and connective tissue changes in the semilunar ganglia seem to support this view. Regarding the theory of the pigmentation in Addison's' disease, his conclusions are as follows: The pigmentation of the skin takes place in the deeper layer of the rete Malpighii and in the outer root sheath of the hair follicles. The pigment, however, is not formed in these cells, but in the deeper layer of the cutis, and transferred by amoeboid connective tissue cells. From general pathological considerations, as well as from the relative position. of the wandering cells to the blood vessels, it is highly probable that the pigment is derived from the blood itself; but the deriva tion is not to be referred to alterations in the vessel walls or to hwemorrhages, bE c tuse such conditions are not constant, and when present are usually secondary. In two cases of Addison's disease. Bradshaw7 found tubercle in the one and cretaceous metamor phosis of the adrenals in the other. In the semilunar ganglia,. diminution and pigmentary atrophy of the nerve cells and increase in the connective tissue stroma were the changes noted. In association with other morbid conditions, Beaven Rake has de scribed a case of morbus Addisonii associated with syphilis and leprosy. The adrenals were converted into sac-like bodies filled with brown granular debris and a few small yellow grains having the appearance of minute tubercles. Whether these changes were the result of leprous, syphilitic, or tubercular lesions could not very well be determined. No tubercle bacilli were found. Drs. Samuel West and Hale White8 have reported cases of Addison's disease associated with diabetes and exopthalmic goitre re spectively. Puncture in Intestinal Obstruction.-The value of capillary: puncture of the intestine in cases of extreme flatulent distension, whether due to organic stricture or to a removal cause, is becom ing generally recognised. Our knowledge of the method is chiefly derived from the researches of Dr. John W. Ogle, who not long ago published a valuable little monograph on the subject. He established it as a legitimate procedure, not attended by any ex cessive amount of danger, capable of giving excellent results when. adopted in time, and of yielding the patient much relief as a last resource. At the meeting of the Surgical Congress in Paris, in October, M. Demons, of Bordeaux, reported six cases in which he had made use of this procedure with encouraging results. He used a Dieulafoy's aspirator, so that, if necessary, fluid fieces could be aspirated. His cases were examples of intestinal obstruction, be lieved to be due to peritoneal bands or inflammation of the sub peritoneal tissue. The danger of extravasation of faeces into the peritoneum appears to be small if a fine needle is used, but a case of Sir William Jenner's shows that the operation has certain special dangers. In that case, which was an instance of malignant stricture, each point of puncture was found to have become the. seat of a secondary cancerous deposit. Intussusception.-The use of gaseous enemata in the treatment of intussusception has been sanctioned by long usage, but it is not without danger, and though successful cases have been reported during the past year, the use of enemata of water or oil appears ta promise better results since the pressure can be more readily' measured. A simple means of doing this has b( e i devised by Dr. W. E. Forrest. He assumes that since a column of water 33 feet. high exerts a pressure of 15 pounds on the square inch, a column of water in an ordinary not very narrow india-rubber tube. will exert a pressure of 1 pound to the square inch for each length of 2 feet. Experiment appears to show that in infantR and young 5 Bull. pen. de Ther. 6 V-irchow's Arctiv, Bd. 114. 7 Liverpool Med. ani Surg. Journal, July, 1889. I 8 Report of PrJceedings of Path. Soc.

It follows, therefore, that the neces sary pressure can be obtained with an india-rubber tube 16 feet long; it is provided with a rectal nozzle at one end, and a funnel at the other. The fluid used is warm salt solution, and after the nozzle has been introduce d into the rectum the funnel is slowly raised, until the required height is attained. Metallic Toxcemia.-In a series of experimental researches conducted by Drs. E. Ziegler and N. Obolonsky with a view of investigating the changes produced by the action of arsenic and phosphorus on the tissues, some interestirng results were arrived at, which are well worthy of reference. They will be found pub lished in extenso.9 In order to ascertain the effects of these drugs upon the liver and kidneys, Drs. Ziegler and Obolonsky experimented on rabbits and dogs by the subcutaneous administration of small doses repeated over various periods of time, or by the administra tion of the drug in the form of pills with their food. The ani mals were killed from time to time, and the organs preserved. In the case of arsenic, the organs found to be most frequently affected were undoubtedly the liver and kidneys, in' which impor tant histological changes were discovered, even in tnstances where there was little or no evidence of macroscopic change. The changes seem to affect both the parenchyma and the interstitial connective tissue more or less contemporaneously. In the liver, during the whole time ot tne operation of the poison, degenerative changes in the hepatic cells were in progress, namely, moderate fatty degeneration, dropsical swelling and vacuolation, and mole cular disintegration of their nuclei. Here and there a patch was met with in which the liver cells showed signs of proliferative activity. Regarding the interstitial changes, they were very active and of a proliferative character, and. were seen mostly around the capillaries and in the interacinous connective tissue. They could be perceiv-ed quite as early as the second day, but were most pronounced in the second and third weeks. Prolifera tive changes had likewise been observed in the epithelium of the bile ducts, but never to the extent of the formation of new ducts. The parenchymatous and interstitial changes appeared to be co ordinate processes, going on together but apparently independent of each other. From their researches they found that weak doses produced for the most part fatty changes, while strong doses ex cited active proliferative changes as well. Fatty degeneration was unquestionably the most constant and important effect of phosphorus, but the fatty molecules might, even after prolonged operation of the poison, completely disappear from the liver cells. Vacuolation of the cells occurred simultaneously. The stellate cells of the connective tissue, the capillary walls, and the bile ducts were likewise the seat of fatty changes,. I'roliferative and inflammatory phenomena were, relatively speaking, rarer than in arsenical poisoning, and very slight even when present. In caes of slight poisoning the kidneys were unchanged, but in advanced cases fatty degeneration of the epithelium, mostly of the straight tubules, was to be observed. In contrast ing the operation of the two poisons, the effects produced by phosphorus are pre-eminently degenerative and mainly pas sive in their character, while those of arsenic are, in pronounced cases of poisoning, strikingly proliferative as well as degene rative, but the proliferation and the degeneration are not related to each other in such a way that the first may be said to be reparative to the second. The cell proliferation is probably in duced by the direct influence of the poison on the individual cells themselves. Professor F. W. Draper,10 in a paper on the anatomical appearances resulting from poisoning by arsenic, says that if, in addition to gastritis. fatty degeneration is found in the heart, liver, and kidneys, if the blood is dark and fluid, and sub endocardial ecchymoses are also present, there is a strong evidence in favour of arsenical poisoning, and he should be inclined in such a case to call in the chemist to his assistance. It is possible to find sometimes arsenical deposits in the gastric mucou3 mem brane, which is always found more or less reddened, but, with this exception, he would not rely on the results of the examina tion of any single organ for testimony in favour of arsenical poisoning. The examination of the viscera should be exhaustive and conducted in some systematic order. Ziegler and Obolonsky found the gastric mucous membrane in rabbits comparatively unaffected. Drs. Ed. Coen and Giovanni d'Ajutololl have in vestigated the histological changes in the kidneys, muscles, and gastro-intestinal tract in chronic lead poisoning, and the results of their researches may be briefly summarised as follows: Kidneys: first, parenchymatous degeneration and necrosis of the epithelium of the convoluted tubules with the formation of hyaline camt&gt;: secondly, a glomerulitis with hyaline degeneration of the capillat.y tufts; thirdly, a plastic or productive interstitial nephritis which may gradually pass into renal cirrhosis. Muscles: first of all a granular degeneration of the muscle substance is per ceptible; secondly, a patchy interstitial myositis develops. Sto mach: parenchymatous inflammation, with a considerable degree of proliferative change in the epithelium of the follicles; to this succeeds patchy interstitial gastritis, starting around the vessels in the submucosa and extending upwards in the stroma between the glands. Intestine: proliferative inflammation of the sub mucosa and of the reteform tissue between Lieberkihn's follicles. Liver: cloudy swelling and necrosis of the liver cells, cell in filtration of the walls of the bile ducts, and a new formation of fibrous connective tissue, comparable in all respects with the interstitial nephritis. Thus lead makes its poisonous influence felt first and directly on the specific elements of organs, that is, the parenchyma proper; then it operates on the blood vessels and perivascular connective tissue, originates patchy inflammatory foci around the vessels, and terminates in organisation and the production of new fibrous tissue. It is very slowly progressive, and attacks organs only in a disseminated fashion. It is well known that lead poisoning is, in certain cases, manifested by acute symptoms. MIarked anccmia precedes the onset; the earliest sym ptoms are colic, headache, vomiting, and diplopia, which may he succeeded by convulsions and coma, ending in death in a few days. There may be no albuminuria and no gross post-mortem lesions, but Dr. Stephen Mackenzie has stated that in every instance in which a chemical analysis of the brain had been made at the Lon don Hospital distinct, traces of lead have been found. It would appear that these acute cases generally occur among persons newly employed at lead works (Corner). The statistics of the Newcastle Infirmary, as given by Dr. Oliver, are that out of 135 cases 8 died of acute manifestations. All the lacute cases reported occurred among lead workers, but as the symptoms are not very distinctive, it is not improbable that their cause might be overlooked if the patient were not known to have been exposed to lead. In chronic lead poisoning, neuritis and granular contraction of the kidney.s appear to be the most common lesions producing symptoms. Lead favours the retention of uric acid in the blood, and thus the out break of an acute attack of gout; but many facts go to prove that it does not produce gout in a person not predisposed. Thus Dr. Oliver states that gout is practically unknown,among the New castle lead-workers. Renal Dropsy.-Regarding the pathology of renal dropsy, D*. Auld believes that that condition of the blood to which the term ancemia is applied must be regarded as an important factor in the production of the anasarca and dropsy of Bright's disease. First of all it is possible in Bright's disease, as in other conditions, that certain retained products of the organism, or their toxic de rivatives, may exert a deleterious influence on the tonicity of th0 vessel walls. Then we have to consider the grave alterations in the vital and physical properties of the blood when anremia is combined with hydraemic plethora, and the disturbances of the circulation resulting therefrom. By the progressive diminution. in its corpuscles, the vital energy of the blood itself is impaired; and by the advancing attenuation of its proteid constituents, the specific gravity of the plasma becomes relatively lighter than that, of the corpuscles themselves, and its physical relations to the plasma circulating in the lymph canalicular system outside the vessels are materially disturbed. Under these abnormal condi tions the circulation of the blood corpuscles is impeded, the whole vascular tension becomes increased (Hamilton), and transudation of the fluid within the vessels readily takes place; and such transudation will, moreover, be rendered still greater according to the toss ot tonicity of the vessel wall, in whatever way we may consider that condition to be brought about. With increasing anaemia the dropsy becomes augmented, and is regulated in its distribution by physical laws. Where the vis a fronte is greatest and the circulation feeblest, there the dropsy will be found most marked; namely, iu the extremities furthest from the heart. Here the venules become hyperdistended, and are unable to absorb and tranomit the lymph wbich pours forth excessively from the capil laries. Should this state of matters continue, the circulation will fail nearer and nearer the heart, until the fluid accumulates inter 9 Ziegler's Beitrdige zur pathologischen Anaatomie zc. allgemein.

A most important and valuable contribution to this subject has been published during the year by Dr. Saundby 12 whose lectures on Bright's disease handle the subjects of albu minuria, urtemia, renal dropsy, and the cardio-vascular changes in an admirable manner. The latest information on these mat ters will be found set before the reader of these chapters in a terse but very lucid style, while those devoted to the special pa thology of the various forms of Bright's disease are enriched by the author's own extensive personal experience. It is a work which will be extensively read and referred to. Toxic Nephritis.-Even if Lustgarten's discovery of numerous micro-organisms in the urine of persons suffering from acute nephritis has, so far, not met with much confirmation, the views of Semmola13 on the toxcemic theory of nephritis have met with considerable support in a discussion which took place at the recent meeting of the Italian Society of Medicine upon Bright's disease.14 Semmola believes albuminuria to depend upon the mal assimilation of proteids, and M. Rattone so far supports this, that he states, in his opinion, nephritis is set up by the transition through the kidney of substances which have a toxic action, and produce inflammatory changes in the vascular apparatus, the con nective tissue, and the epithelium. In a large number of cases acute nephritis is the effect of the operation of some poison, whether organic and particulate, such as a microbe, or else of a chemical nature. Dr. Maragliono concurred in this view, and, re garding the acute nephritis supervening in pneumonia, said that although the pneumococcus had not been discovered in the kid ney, he had no doubt that the renal inflammation was set up by the absorption of some toxic products from the diseased lungs. These views as to the nature and etiology of acute nephritis oc curring in other severe febrile disorders are, in a great measure, confirmed by a paper recently published by Drs. Crooke and Nason on the occurrence of acute htcmorrhagic nephritis in sup purative meningitis. Two of the cases of meningitis were mani -festly septic, while the third seemed to be a simple case. In one case the nephritis was undoubtedly secondary to, and caused by, the meningiti6; in a second there was strong presumptive evidence of its secondary n-ature, while in a third its relationship to the meningitis was not so clearly determined, but still highly prob able. The distinguishing features of the nephritis were its pro nounced haemorrhagic type, and its resemblance, as regards its intratubular exudation to the inflammatory process in acute croupous pneumonia. In none of the cases were evidences of embolism present, and in none could they satisfy themselves as to the presence of micro-organisms. They mention incidentally another case of acute nephritis of an exquisitely catarrhal type occurring in a case of cancrum ovis; and though various micro, organisms were found in profusion at the local seat of the disease they could not be detected in the kidney. In all these cases, not withstanding the absence of micro-organisms, the ureters main tain the septic nature of the nephritis, which they believe to h-tve been originated by the absorption of some toxic product allied to the ptomaines or leucomaines, and probpbly manufactured at the seat of the primary disease. They are inclined to attribute the marked hTmorrhagic character of the nephritis in the cases of meningitis to some obscure nervous influence originating in, and reflected from, so to speak, the vasomotor disturbances common to meningitis. The Morbidi Anatomy and Histology of Br-ight's Disease.15 In a very brief abstract of a paper on the above subject, read at the Pathological Section of the British Medical Association at Leeds this year, it is not difficult to discern in Dr. Crooke a strong ad herent to the doctrine of the unity of Bricht's disease. The only link he could not include in the chain of evidence is represented by certain cases of chronic interstitial nephritis (red granular kidney), -such as occur in gout and other states, where the cardio-vascular changes precede the nephritis. He agrees with Dr. Saundby in not being able, so far as his observations have yet led him, to include lardaceous kidney as a special form of Bright's disease. He has observed lardaceous changes associated in large white kidney, but does not think they bear any causal relation to the chronic in flammatory chaiigss present, which are often quite extensive. In these cases he regards the lardaceous changes as a concomitant morbid process, traceable to the same causes as the nephritis itself. He has examples in his possession showing the transitional stages of large white into the small white contracting kidney. The paper is based on the examination of a large material-over 150 cases of Bright's disease-and represents work extending over ten or twelve years. Presumably it will be published at some future time in eatlenso. The Morbid Anatomy and Pathology of Chronic Alcoholism. This important inquiry was selected for special discussion at the Pathological Society of London during the session 1888-89.16 The debate was opened by Dr. Payne, who, after a short historical introduction, first propounded his views as to the manner in which alcohol acted as a poison on the tissues, and then pro ceeded to enumerate the changes found in the viscera and nervous system. These changes appear to be degenerative and productive in their nature; the former affects the specialised or parenchymatous elements of the organs, the latter affects princi pally the perivascular connective tissue, and appears to be of a chronic inflammatory type, resulting in the overgrowth of fibrous tissue. But whether the one is to be regarded as the primary and the other secondary, or whether both operate concurrently, are questions upon which a considerable diversity of opinion was expressed. Taking the viscera first, the liver appears unques tionably to be the organ most frequently affected, since it is also the first to feel the effects of the poison. Following out his theory as to the toxic action of alcohol, Dr. Payne argued strongly in favour of the view that the essential and primary changes in this organ were the parenchymatous, affecting the liver cells in the form of fatty degeneration and necrosis, while the interstitial changes he regarded as secondary, and present in greater or less degree, according to the chronicity of the case. Dr. Lionel Beale went even further; for what most pathologists take to be a new formation of fibrous tissue he regards simply as the debris of the atrophied liver substance, and the entire process, according to him, is simply atrophic. The weight of testimony, however, was in favour of the now widely-accepted view that the connective tissue is the seat of the primary changes, which are mostly slowly proliferative,17 and may be found to exist even when there is little or no evidence of parenchymatous degeneration present. Coming now to the nervous system to seek for structural changes to account for the paraplegic symptoms, those found in the brain are comparatively unimportant and by no means distinctive; they are simply atrophic, and comparable in all respects to those found in senile decay. But whatever functional or psychical disturbances might be attributed to them, these were ably discussed by Dr. Savage, who dealt mainly with the relationship between alcoholic paralysis and insanity. Little or no change has been found in the spinal cord, while important and sometimes extensive changes have been discovered in the peripheral nerve trunks. These consist in degeneration of the nerve fibres and interstitial neuritis, which is sometimes cha racterised by much small-celled infiltration of the connective tissue. In alcoholic neuritis, the parenchymatous and the inter stitial changes seem to go hand in hand, there being no evidence as yet to decide the point as to which is the primary. Dr. Buzzard referred, however, to cases described by Striimpell and others, which formed such marked exceptions to the above rule, that Erb sulggested the two processes represented two distinct diseases, namely, a degenerative atrophy of peripheral nerve fibres, and an interstitial neuritis, having no connection with the former. Not withstanding the absence of any observable lesion, Dr. Buzzard has for some time felt that there was probably some change in the cord responsible for the coincident and limited affection of so many nerves, and some years ago suggested that it was upon the vasomotor centres in the medulla that the toxic action of alcohol was primarily excited. Other changes, evidently secondary to those in the nerves, have been described by Drs. Hadden and Ormerod in the muscles, namely, granular atrophy of the muscular fibres and interstitial myositis, and Dr. Mott found extensive fatty degeneration of the heart in one case. Regarding the kidneys, there is but little evidence to show that any influence can be ascribed to alcohol as a direct factor in the production of granular kidney, though it may materially assist in the presence of other 12 Lectures on Broght's Disease, Hamilton, Adams and Co., 1889. 13A-ch. de PAl.esiologie, see also Gaucher, Recherches Exp6rimentales sur la Pathogenie des N6phrites par Auto-intoxication, Rev. de Medecinze, viii, p. 883, 1888. 14 La France Medicale, No. 127. *15 The Histology of Bright's Disease, by George F.

Another point of in terest brought out in the discussion was the frequent association of pulmonary phthisis and tuberculosis with alcoholic paralysis. Concerning their pathological relationship, Dr. Hadden thought the pulmonary lesions might be attributed to changes in the branches of the vagus supplying the lungs, which impaired their nutrition tone so as to predispose them to inflammatory changes, and that these latter formed a suitable nidus for the tubercle bacillus to settle in and multiply. Altogether, the discussion has been fruitful in bringing to our knowledge many changes of in terest that were previously but little known; it forms a compact and valuable contribution to the literature of the subject, and will serve as a guide to future investigators in their attempts to clear up what still remains obscure or doubtful in the pathology of the disease. Pernicious Ancemia.-In considering the pathology of this disease we are met, as Dr. Russell aptly puts it,18 on the very threshhold of the inquiry with the following problem, Is it the result of the diminished formation, or of increased destruction of the red corpuscles? For we certainly have to do with a true oligocythaemia in pernicious anmemia, even if the individual cor puscles are as rich, or even richer, than the normal in the amount of hmemoglobin. Assuming that the red marrow is at least one of, if not the most, important seat of blood formation, then, if the re placement of the ordinary yellow marrow of the long bones by red marrow (Pepper and Tyson) be regarded as a morbid change whose presence is essential to pernicious anmemia, Russell thinks there is but one answer to the question of diminished production, and that is a negative one. The change in the marrow has been found also in other wasting, cachectic, aneemic conditions, and in a case of antemia from hoemorrhage by Neumann; it is the expression of an effort on the part of this tissue to meet the demand for red corpuscles in which it becomes hyperplased. On the other hand, Russell found in the same case of pernicious anmemia evidences enough of blood destruction, the products of which, in the shape of hkematin pig ment in combination with iron he found plentiful in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Not the least interesting part of his paper is that which is concarned with the results of his search for evidences of blood destruction in these organs taken from other cases met with in everyday work of the post-mortem room. The pigment was detected in the usual way by treating either small blocks or thin sections of the tissue first with a solution of ferrocyanide of potassium, and then washing in dilute hydro chloric acid. The pigment comes out stained the colour of Prussian blue. In the livers of forty-four cases the reaction was marked in seven, and in the spleen in six out of the seven, and in the kidney in three. In twenty cases where no reaction was obtained in the liver, the spleen was examined in ten, four of which yielded positive results. From these observations Russell is uuable to regard the disease known as pernicious anaemia pri marily a liver disease, especially in the face of evidence of blood destruction in the spleen and kidney. No doubt blood destruction does go on in the liver in an exaggerated degree, and this is pro bably due to some condition in which the blood reaches the liver. But what the antecendent condition of the blood may be we are not yet in a position to state, until the whole history of the blood elaborating and blood-purifying processes in the body are more fully known. Reference may be specially made to the extremely able lec tures of Dr. William Hunter on transfusion, its physiology, path ology, and practice,which embody much original research and philo sophical thought. They were published in the JOURNAL, July to August, 1889, and should be read in their entirety, and the numerous experiments carefully examined, for these constitute mainly the premisses from which Dr. Hunter draws his interest ing and valuable conclusions as to the utility and practical applica tion of transfusion. Brain. Exophthalmic Goitre.-Hale White"n published a case which he argued showed that exophthalmic goitre was a disease due to a functional disturbance of the central nervous system in the neighbourhood of the floor of the fourth ventricle. Visual Centres.-Danillo20 and Lannegrace2' have studied in the human subject the relation of the cortex to vision, and have come to the conclusion that a lesion of one occipital lobe has no effect on vision, lesion of the angular gyrus affects the vision of the opposite eye for a short time, a lesion of both these parts affects both eyes, producing crossed amblyopia as well as crossed hemiopia. It will be seen that these results agree with those of Ferrier. Laryngeal Centres.-In the last number of the JOURNAL Semon and Horsley have located the centres for the laryngeal muscles. Internal Capsule.-In a paper read this month before the Royal Society Beevor and Horsley have shown the arrangement of the fibres in the capsule and the effect of their stimulation. Functions of the Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve.-Pope has published an extremely important case2 in which a thrombosed vertebral artery pressed upon the left glosso-pharyngeal nerve. There was loss of power of swallowing and of raising the palate of the left side, due to the unopposed action of the levator palati, and complete loss of taste at the back of the tongue on the left side, and loss of taste to sweet things even on the front of the left side. The Influence of the Corpuus Striatum and Optic Thalamus on Temperature.-Hale Whitei3 has published a paper on the influ ence on the bodily temperature of lesions of the corpus striatum and optic thalamus, in which, after carefully taking the normal temperature of the animals operated upon, he injured in some cases the corpus striatum, in others the optic thalamus, in others the white matter. A considerable rise of temperature always followed when the basal ganglia were affected by the lesion, but never when the white matter only was implicated. It is shown that these rises of temperature are much greater than can be ac counted for by the administration of the ancesthetic or the mere operation. In rabbits the rise of temperature is bilateral. Some cases published by the same author show that in man a similar rise of temperature occurs in lesions of the basal ganglia, but that the rise is usually greater on the side opposite the lesion. Ott has published three papers on the same subject. In one2" he argues that in the lower animals at least the rapidity of respira tion is the most important agent in regulating the bodily tem perature, and that in lesions at the base of the brain the tempera ture mounts because this regulatory mechanism is disturbed. In his two other papers2) Ott argues in favour of the nervous origin of fever, using the terminology of Dr. MIacAlister's Goulstonian lectures. Diagnosis of Disease of Corpora Quadrigemina.-In the following number of Brain Nothnagel contributes an important paper on dis eases of the corpora quadrigemina, and concludes that there are grounds for localising a tumour in that position, if unsteady reeling gait is an early symptom, and if it is associated with ophthalmo plegia existing in both eyes, but not quite symmetrically nor im plicating all the muscles in equal degree. Localisation qf Olfactory Sense.-Hughlings Jackson and Beevor26 record a case, in which there was a small sarcoma at the ex treme anteriorendoftherighttemporo-sphenoidal lobe. Thepatient during life complained subjectively of a very unpleasant smell. A far as it goes, this case confirms our ideas of the localisation of smell. Thomsen's and Allied Diseases.-Martins and Hauseman27 have recorded an important case, in which there was spasm upon volun tary effort affecting the upper extremities only. Although in some respects this case resembled Thomsen's disease, yet it was very different in the freedom of the lower extremities, and also the malady did not appear to be constantly pre3ent, but only in cold weather. Also a case of Thomsen's disease is recorded in the Neurol. Central., October 1st, 1889. Ophthalmoplegia and Poliomyelitis.-Sachs, in a paper on polio myelitis and polioencephalitis,28 brings forward a case to show that ophthalmoplegia is related to anterior poliomyelitis of the spinal cord in the same way that the latter is related to bulbar piralysis; so that we have now a complete ascending series of inflammation, affecting either the anterior coronal cells in the cord or their homologues in the brain. Tremulous _Diseases.-It is well known that Ilorsley showed that experiments upon the thyroid gland may, in monkeys, give rise to tremulous movements. Starr2" discusses the patho logy of tetany, and shows that it cannot be due, as has been siigaested. to intoxication from the thyroid aland. and he 22 JOURNAL, November 23rd, 1889. 23 JOURNAL, June 22nd, 1889. 24 Jour. of Neit. and Meatt.

Diller30 gives us a very interesting paper on hereditary chorea, and quite confirms the usually received impression that it differs from ordinary chorea in coming on at middle life, in being associated with a weak mental condition, and in never recovering. Suckling31 has also recorded a most interesting case of hereditary chorea. The patient's mother, sister, and daughter had it. Tais same author also records two cases of Friedreich's atada. Pitres, in a paper in Le Pi'0ogres Mgdical, Nos. 37 and 38, 1889, discusses hysterical tremors, which he divides into three varieties, namely, (1) shaking tremors, generally limited to one of the lower extremities, and consisting of rapid rhythmical movements of flexion and extension; (2) vibrating tremors, which consist of rapid minute oscillations, and may affect any part of the body; and (3) voluntary hysterical tremors, which are those produced only when some voluntary act is attempted. Cerebral Abscess and Turnours.-Several instances of operation for cerebral abscess have been published, but they do not teach us anything new, and a great many cases of cerebral tumour have been recorded, but they only show features in localisation already well known. The Cerebral Circulation.-Some experiments -performed by Corin32 show how extremely difficult it is to control the pressure in the cerebral artery by ligature, either of the vertebrals or in ternal carotids. These results should be borne in mind when con sidering the possibility of arresting cerebral heemorrhage by ligature of the carotids. Rummo and Ferrannini:33 have studied the influence of hypnotic substances upon the cerebral circulation. They experimented upon cases in which the skull was deficient. During natural sleep from 10 P.M. to 1 A.Xf. there was ischtemia; from 1 to 3 A.M., vascular dilation; and from 3 to 5 A.M., vaso constriction of cerebral vessels. Similar observations with drugs show that some substances, such as narceine and morpheine, modify the excitability of the nerve centres; others, such as chloral hydrate, paraldehyde, and ethyl urethane, modify the cerebral circulation; while others, such as hypnone and methylal, modify both. Special Cases.-Passing now to the more clinical side of cerebral diseases, we have a few interesting cases to note. Messrs. Wiglesworth and Bickerton3" called attention to the great frequency of errors of refraction among epileptics. Dr. Hadden has, in the same number of this journal, recorded an interesting case of xerostomia, or dry mouth. Those who wish to study the microscopical appearances of the grey centres in the cerebrum will do well to consult a paper by Vittorio Marchi3' on the shape and grouping of the cells of the corpora striata and optic thalami. Bernhardt36 has published some examples of a rare form of spinal and bulbar paralysis complicated with muscular atrophy. Spinal Cord. The Cord in Epilepsy.-Messrs. Gotch and Horsley towards the end of last year brought before the Royal Society the results of some experiments they had made in which, after the cortex cerebri was stimulated in the monkey, the spinal cord in the dorsal region was tapped electrically, and an electrometer intro duced into the circuit. There was only a movement of the electro meter when the cortical area for the lower limb was touched, never when the arm or other area was stimulated, even if a strong current was used. The excursions of the mercury of the electro meter were photographed, and it was found that the electro motive changes in the spinal cord are exactly parallel, as regards the character of their sequence, to the convulsions of muscles as recorded by the graphic method. The authors conclude that the existence of the epileptic rhythm in the dorsal region of the spinal cord points to its being almost entirely of cortical origin. Ascending Degenerations.-Dr. Tooth and Mr. Horsley37 have studied the effect upon the cord of cutting the posterior nerve roots. They divided all the posterior roots of the cauda equina on the right side. At the level of the fifth lumbar there was a minute point of degeneration at the apex of the posterior cornu; this increased in size as it was traced upwards, till at the level of the third lumbar it occupied most of the postero-external column; in the dorsal region it was much smaller again, and triangular in shape, with the base at the posterior median fissure and the apex coming to the surface between the posterior median fissure and the posterior root; in the cervical region there was only a minute tract of degeneration in the posterior median column close to the pos terior median fissure, and a little in front of its posterior extremity. These experiments were performed upon monkeys, and they con-* firmed those carried out by other observers upon other animals. With regard to the cerebellar tract, Dr. Tooth points out that, in monlkeys at least, in the lower dorsal region, it is composed chiefly of small fibres, and in the cervical and upper dorsal regions chiefly of large fibres which occupy the posteribr part of the tract. This was confirmed experimentally; for in the experiments just quoted there was no degeneration of the cerebellar tract; but if the sec tioni of the posterior nerve roots was carried out in the cervical region there was degeneration above the section, not only in the posterior column, but also in tbe posterior part of the cerebellar tract. Consequently tho posterior roots do not enterinto the com position of the lower part of the c-rebellar tract ; and it is most probable that its lower part really consists of fine descending fibres which have passed out from the croased pyramidal tract. These are probably visceral fibres. Most likely the direct cere bellar tract conducts sensozy impressions from the upper part of the body and the upper limbs, and the antero-lateral fibres from the lower part of the body and the lower limbs. Cere6ro-spinal Fluid.-Halliburton39 has investigated the com posicion of cerebro-spinal fluid, and finds no peculiarity as regards the saline constituents, but great interest attaches to the presence of albumoses and peptones, although no digestive ferment could be discotered which could have produced them. It is curious that cerehro-spinal fluid contains pyrccatechin. Evperimental Myelitis.-In the Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases for April, 1889, is a long paper on experi mental myelitis which was produced by quickly passing a ligature round the cord with a curved needle, and drawiilg it tight against the spine. It was found that there were almost directly acute inflammatory changes in the grey matter, but the white passed into a condition of inflammation much later. The muscles under went atrophy with vacuolation of their fibres, with but little increase of fibrous tissue, and no great multiplication of nuclei, a change was produced, in fact, like that found in progressive muscular atrophy. Relations of Cord and Vertebr6e.-Reed 39 has shown that it is quite impossible to tell precisely from the position of the spinous processes the position of the nerve roots. Ganqlion of Posterior Root.-Gad and Joseph 4" have confirmed what is known about the trophic infltuence of the ganglion upon the posterior root. They consider that nearly all centripetal nerve paths are interrupted in the ganglia and that impressions are delayed for 0.036 of a second. T'he Knee.jerk.-It has for a long while been felt that the usually-accepted theory for the knee-jerk, that as the jerk took place in so short a time it was not a genuine reflex, but that the influence of the cord upon the jerk was due to a presiding influ ence over the tone of the muscles, is very unsatisfactory, so that it is pleasing to find that Lombard41 is able to bring strong argu ments against this view from the side of experimental physiology, and also that he considers that the knee-jerk is a genuine reflex act, and that the apparent time discrepancy is due to a faulty measurement of the time occupied by the reflex act. Peripheral Nerves.-Not much new work has been done in this dlepartment, but many excellent cases have been recorded, and our previous knowledge has been confirmed. Bradford42 has shown that all renal vasomotor nerves leave the spinal cord through the anterior roots chiefly from the sixth to the thirteenth dorsal nerves, below this in gradually decreasing numbers to the third andi fourth lumbar. There are two kinds, vaso-constructor and vaso dilator; the former are best developed. Ross has written a, valuable paper on the premonitory symptoms of alcoholic para lysis.43 According to him the most important are (1) disorders of tactile sensibility of the extremities, which the patients usually describe as numbness of the fingers and toes; (2) vasomotor spasm of the extremities, which the patients describe as a 30 Int.

Behrend44 has described lesions of nerves in certain forms of alopecia areata, and in the same volume of the same periodical Miura discusses the etiology and condition of the skin in kakke. Ddjerine4- has contributed an important paper, in which he 'has shown that muscular atrophy is common in those who die of tabes dorsalis, and he considers that this atrophy is due to the pleripheral neuritis which so often accompanies tabes dorsalis, and Dr. Weir Mitchell has brought forward a case of locomotor ataxy confined to the arms. Suzaki, at a meeting of the Medical Society in Japan, brought forward cases to show that in leprosy the ten don reflexes are increased; from this he concludes that there must be in this disease changes in the spinal cord. Affleck46 records -two cases in which there was peripheral neuritis associated with Raynaud's disease, but this is probably only an effect of a common -eause; at any rate it cannot, for many reasons, be the cause of Raynaud's disease. Suckling47 has recorded some :cases of peri pheral neuritis occurring among brassworkers. Mackenzie48 records a case in which a patient died from rupture of the phrenic nerve; -death was instantaneous. Therapeutics of Nervous Diseases. Hypnotics.-Much interest has been taken in hypnotics, and an 'admirable summary of our knowledge of the chemistry and physio logical action of the newer hypnotics will be found in the address which Professor Leech delivered at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association. Sulphonal continues to hold a high ,place as a safe hypnotic. The worst results that may follow its use seem to be that sometimes giddiness, headache, and weakness -of the legs are produced. Some admirable cases showing its value have been published by Drs. Percy Smith, Sutherland, and Bond.49 'Chloralamide, too, appears to be a valuable hypnotic, having very few, if any, Mad after-effects. It has the advantage over sulphonal ,that it is more easily soluble and it is much cheaper. In a recent number of the JOURNAL Hale White has recorded twenty cases to whom it was administered. Thirty grains is the usual dose, and it dissolves with spirit, and, therefore, a good way to give it is to take it in a little brandy and water about half an hour before -going to bed. It is feebly soluble in water. Many Continental ,observers record successful cases of its employment. Compression of the Carotid.-Messrs. Spencer and Horsley have suggested that compression of the carotid artery might be -tried in the human subject to control cerebral bhemorrhage, but at 'present this method of treatment has not found many advocates. Nerve Stretching in Leprosy.-Dr. Beaven Rake has in his Government report studied the effec.t of nerve-stretching in lep Trosy. He performed a hundred operations, and came to the con -clusion that the best nerve to stretch was the sciatic, for it is nearest the spinal ganglia, and commands the supply of the whole 'leg, and foot, and back of the thigh. The operation only seemed to be of value for the pain associated with ulceration, but often in these cases the relief was very marked. Surgical Treatment of General Paralysis and of Epilepsy. 4Quite recently Dr. Claye Shaw has recorded in the JOURNAL a case ,in which large portions of the bones of the skull were removed in a patient suffering from general paralysis of the insane; the dura mater was cut and much subarachnoid fluid wasF let out. It is -stated that the patient was much improved after the operation; but, 'before passing any opinion upon its value, we must have many anorelcases before us. Dr. Alexander51 has suggested removing the -superior cervical ganglion for epilepsy. It is difficult to know 'what sound reason there can be for this; for, as far as we know, the superior cervical ganglion has no function that can be con .cerned in the production of epilepsy. Still, as it has been advised, tprobably many will be induced to try it. The statistics given are encouraging-so encouraging, in fact, that one is tempted to sus pect a fallacy somewhere. Simulo in Eptlepsy.-Stan52 has confirmed previous observations that simulo is a useful remedy for epilepsy in cases in which ibromides have failed. Gauster,53 after the result of a very large experience in the treatment of epilepsy by bromide of potassium, comes to the conclusion that it is the best mode of treatment we at present possess; but it must be used in very large doses (3 iv. or 3 v. a day) for a long while, and must be omitted on the ap pearance of any symptoms of bromidism. The loss of intellectual power and moderate emaciation are not contra-indications, but the patient should eat heartily; wasting diseases are a contra-indica tion. Suspension in -Diseases of the Spinal Cord.-The treatment of diseases of the spinal cord by suspension has attracted much at tention. Although Motchukowski, as long ago as 1883. sus pended patients suffering from tabes dorsalis, it was not till the commencement of the present year the treatment was brought prominently forward by Charcot and Gilles de la Tourette.54 The patient is suspended in an ordinary Sayre's apparatus; the feet are just off the ground. At first the suspension lasts a minute, afterwards its duration is gradually increased till the patient remains suspended for about seven minutes. The suspensions take place on alternate days. About thirty suspensions are generally considered enough. Except that in extremely rare cases a rise of tem perature has followed, no evil results have ensued when the suspen sion has been properly applied. Three or four inistances of death, probably from dislocation of the cervical vertebzre, have been re corded in patients who suspended themselves. It would be im possible here to criticise all the hundreds of cases that have been published. According to some authors the most striking improve ment has resulted. The cases that have been quoted as having done best come from French sources. Thus Charcot53 reports that in most of his cases the power to stand with the eyes shut is im proved, and the patient complains less of vesical troubles, numb ness, anvesthesia, pains and insomnia; and if there has been im potence, sexual desire and the possibility of erections return. As far as can be judged after a year's trial, it seems that those who first tried the treatment over-estimated its value. Thus some cases have been recently recorded in the Lancet from the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, in which no good resulted. Dr. Saundby's cases did not improve much. Dujardin Beaumetz has recorded cares in which the most careful tracings of the walking were taken before and after suspension; he is in clined to think that not much good resulted. Abadie obtained the best results in cases in which the diagnosis was doubtful. A care ful study of the published cases, and those under our own care, leads us to the conclusion that the symptoms which are most under the patient's will, such as inco-ordination pains, numbness, incontinence of urine, are certainly benefited by suspension; but the organic symptoms, such as the loss of the reflexes, are not im proved. This makes it probable that supension only acts mentally. That the novelty of the treatment, and the full hope that it will do some good, are perhaps the chief reasons why the patients feel better after it. When the craze for it has died down it will pro bably cease to be beneficial and will fall into disuse, just as metal lotherapy has done. An important paper on the. subject by Messrs. Haushalter and Adams has recently appeared in the November number of the Progres Medical. The authors agree with the opinion we have expressed upon the value of the treatment. It has been suggested that the benefit may be due to the separation of the vertebrse, general traction, and hyperaemia of the cord (Charcot and Motchutkowski), to aniemia of the cord (Dujardin Beaumetz), or to tparing down of adhesions of the meninges. By a most careful series of experiments Haushalter and Adams have shown that the lengthening of the vertebril column during sus pension is no greater than often takes place physiologically; that even when the vertebral column is stretched, the cord, its nerves, and vessels are not appreciably altered. The treatment has been applied in a number of other diseases, such as myelitis, dissemi nated sclerosis, lateral sclerosis, Friedreich's disease, paralysis agitans, etc., but without much benefit. Quite recently there has appeared in Brain a translation of Motschutkowski's paper, and appended to it is the after history of some of his cases; from this it appears that the benefit was permanent, although no more sus pension had been employed. Bonuzzi has attempted to obtain all the good effects of suspension without any of its disadvantages, by forcibly flexing the legs on the body and bending the body forwards. From experiments on the dead subject and one experi ment upon the living, he concludes the circulation in the spinal cord is profoundly modified. 4 Virchow's Archiv, Bd. 117. 45 Rev. de MMd. 46 JOURNAL, December 8th, 1888. 47 JOURNAL, December 15tl, 1VQ88. 48 Indian Med.

Hypnotism.-In the department of hypnotism the Charcot or Salpetri6re school have not brought forward any new facts. The Nancy school continue to treat patients suffering from the most various disorders by suggestion. Voisin, during his visit to England, related some of his experiments and their sur prising results. In England not much has been done with hyp notism, for the attempts to use it for medical purposes have been chiefly carried out upon lunatics, who, it is universally acknow ledged, are the most difficult patients to cure; in fact it is often quite impossible to hypnotise the insane, The literature of the subject is increasing at an enormous rate, but nearly all the articles published consist of nothing but a short report of cases cured by suggestion. Heidenhain's theory of the hypnotic state still remains the most satisfactory that we have. Recent Books and Papers on Neurology,-It will perhaps be useful to mention some books and articles which have ap peared in England during 1889, and which contain information on special branches of neurology. Such are: The Surgery of the Spinal Cord, by IF. Thorburn; A Textbook of Mental Diseases, by W. Bevan Lewis; The Injuries and Diseases of Nerves, by A. Bowlby; A Textbook of General Therapeutics, by W. Hale White (chapters on hypnotism, electricity, suspension treatment, Weir Mitchell treatment, etc.). The Goulstonian lectures on the secondary degenerations of the spinal cord, by H. H. Tooth (JOURNAL, March); the Lettsomian lectures on syphilis and the nervous system, by W. R. Gowers (JOURNAL, April); on peripheral neuritis, by J. Ross (Med. Chron., June-December, 1889); on the absence of the corpus callosum, by Alexander Bruce (Brain, part xlvi); cerebral localisation in its practical relations, by C. K. Mills (Ibid., parts xlvi and xlvii); the pathology of central aphasia, by Allen Starr (lbid., part xlvi); and cerebral localisation in its practical relations, by D. Ferrier (Ibid., part xlvi); the morbid anatomy of chronic alcoholism, by J. F. Payne (Path. Trans., 1889); on the value of eye symptoms in cerebral disease (Ophthal. Trans., 1889). DERMATOLOGY. Penideh Ulcer.-Woskrensky has reported on thirty-four cases of "Penjdeh ulcer," observed in the Military Hospital at Merv. He does not consider that this is the same disease as the bouton de biskra, Indian ulcer, etc. It has an incubation period, lasting from three to eight days. In a third of the cases observed there was a secondary nodular eruption, and lymphangitis in about one half. Anthrarobin.-Further experiments on the action of anthrarobin in psoriasis have shown that it is much inferior to chrysarobin, or even pyrogallic acid, and that it is liable to create a considerable amounit of dermatitis. Cure of Sarcoma by arysipelas.-Bruns has reported three cases of sarcoma (diagnosis confrmed by the microscope), which were permanently cured by an attack of idiopathic erysipelas. Alopecia Areata.-Josepb, of Berlin, had attempted to support the nerve theory of alopecia areata by experiments on animals. Thp;e experiments have been repeated by Dr. Behrend who found that section of the sympathetic in the neck did not lead to baldness. Treatment of Leucoplakia.-Rosenberg has found good results by painting patches of leucplakia buccalis with balsam (f Peru. Tthe painful and fissured spots are painted by means of a soft brush, while on the insensible spots frictions are made with a hard brush, the paintings and frictions being made one to three times a day by the patient. After each application the balsam is to be retained in the motuth for three to five minutes. lodic Purpura.-Besnier has brought forward the case of a patient in whom iodide of potassium produced purpura of the legs, but who could take tincture of iodine with impunity, and suggests that iodic purpura occurs only when iodide:of potassium is given, and that pure iodine does not cause it. Ichthyosis in Infancy.-R6na has reported two cases of early ichthyosis, a firstborn child being affected immediately after birth, and dying of the disease at the age of four months. In the other case the disease occurred within the first week of life. Treatment of Keloid.-M. Vidal has stated that he has been successful in the treatment of keloid by scarification. The scari fication must penetrate the entire depth of the lesion. The pro jecting part only represents one-third of the entire thickness. No nucleus of the keloid must be left. The result is slow. Vaccinia and Lupus.-Besnier has shown the case of a young man in which a vaccinal cicatrix was the seat of a limited patch of lupus vulgaris. Psorospermosis.-Darier has described two unique cases of parasitic affection of the skin, under the name of "follicular vegetating psorospermosis." A small papule, crowned by a blackish-brown or greyish crust, when removed leaves behind it A depression corresponding to a dilated follicle. These papules are found on the whole body, but mostly on the scalp, face, sternum, loins, and, above all, on the inguinal regions. The parasite is a sporozoon, and they are found,,isolated and in:groups in the rete mucosum, and in the cells. Wart Bacilli.-Kiihnemann states that in all the cases of warts which he has examined he has found a characteristic bacillus. The bacilli are found between and in the cells of the stratum dentatum of the epidermis, and seldom in the cutis. They are very delicate, and are found most plentifully in recent warts. Zoster Gangrenosus.- Kaposi has published four cases of atypical zoster gangrenosus. They were characterised by an eruption in the form of grouped papules and vesicles, gangrene and destruction of the skin at the base of the eruption, and a cyclical course. The eruption is apt to relapse. Lichen Ruber.-An interesting discussion has taken place during the year (chiefly in Paris and America) on lichen ruber. M. Besnier considers that the nomenclature is responsible for some of the confusion which has existed, and maintains that there is no means of distinguishing the pityriasis rubra pilaris of French from the lichen ruber accuminatus of American authors. Xanthoma.-Besnier has remarked, in reference to diabetic xanthoma, the greater frequency of buccal localisations and the usual, but not constant, absence of palpebral plaques, and that buccal xanthoma usually, but not always, undergoes spontaneous involution, is intermittent or remittent, progresses with rapidity, but disappears quickly without leaving any trace. Leprosy.-During the year an unusual amount of attention has been given to leprosy, the death of Father Damien especially having excited the attention of the public to the disease. Arch deacon Wright has published a book in which he has brought to gether evidence collected from various sources with the object of showing that leprosy is contagious, and Mr. Macnamara has pub lished a second edition of a pamphlet originally published in Calcutta in 1866, in which he expressed the opinion that the disease is hereditary and communicable. In both these publica tions interesting facts are given regarding the origin and spread of leprosy in the Sandwich Islands. Zuriaga has published facts observed by him at the village of Limat de Valldigna (Valencia, Spain), which appear to point very unmistiakably to the trans mission of leprosy by contagion. Armauer Eansen visited America in order to make inquiries regarding the descendants of the lepers who had emigrated there from Norway. He found that of the descendants of 160 individuals none had becomelepers; of the original 160 only 16 or 17 are now living. Paget's -Disease of the Nipple.-Dr. Wickham, of Paris, has stated that in Paget's disease of the nipple he has found the scales on the surface filled with parasites of the class of sporozoa. SURGERY. Antiseptic Surgery.-Cerebral Surgery.-Spznal &amp;urgery.- Thoracic Surgery.-Abdominal Surgery.-Hepatic Surgery.-Splenectomy. -Renal Surgery.-Surgery of the Urinary Organs. - Radical Cure of Hernia.-Cancer of the Rectum-.Operations on the Larynx.-Grafting. Antiseptic Surgery.-In this annual review of the progress of surgery it would seem advisable to direct attention at first to the latest improvement and modifications that have been made in the technical details of the antiseptic method. Although this method is now almost universally recognised and practised by surgeons, there is still much difference of opinion as to the utility of all the precautions which have been insisted on as necessary condi tions of success, and also a general agreement that there is much difficulty in finding a thoroughly satisfactory antiseptic agent for purposes of dressing. There is now, however, good reason for be lieving that this difficulty has at last been overcome, and that in the course of the new year surgeons will have at their disposal a new antiseptic preparation which will prove potent and effectual, and at the same time be free from the inconvenient and trouble some effects of those which have hitherto been used. In an ad dress delivered before the Medical Society of London on Novem ber 4th Sir Joseph Lister stated that, after numerous experiments carried out with the object of finding a better antiseptic agent than corrosive sublimate or sal alembroth, he had discovered in a</page><page sequence="23">Dec. 28, 1889. TIHE BRITISI MED1CAL JOURNAL. 1455 double cyanide of mercury and zinc a substance posse?sing very important antiseptic properties. Sir Joseph has used this agent for one year in hospital practice, and recommends the dressing of which it forms the active element as the most satisfactory he has hitherto met with. The best test of a suitable agent for antiseptic dressing, it is held, is not its germicidal but its inhibitory pro perty. In the course of this important address Sir Joseph stated that he had never been satisfied with dressings of sal alembroth, in consequence of the excessive solubility of this agent, and had not given at any time his published sanction of its extensive em ployment. The practice of drainage in the treatment of operation wounds, which is highly valued by most surgeons and even by those who attach but little importance to the other details of the antiseptic method, has lately been opposed by Professor Boeckel, of Strassburg. This surgeon states that he has now discarded drainage altogether, and regards the practice as erroneous and absurd. This view is supported by the result of a long series of cases in which major operations were performed with complete success without any attemptr to drain the wounds. Boeckel, in other respects, deals with wounds according to the most advanced principles, and is a firm believer in the antiseptic method, and his success, notwithstanding his rejection of so valuable an aid as drainage, may be attributed to the very great care and rigorous antiseptic precautions observed by him in the performance of his operations. On the other hand, Professor Weeks, of Maine, holds that the use of drainage-tubes is more necessary with antiseptic than with other forms of dressing, since under the stimulating in fluence of antiseptic agents more effusion is to be expected. Cerebral Surgery.-The operative treatment of tumour of the brain, so far as can be learnt from published reports, does not seem to have established any further claims to surgical favour. The majority of cases recorded during the past year tend mainly to confirm the views expressed by Dr. J. T. Morrison in a paper on the localisation of intracranial lesions, published in April, that no other department of medical practice more severely taxes the resources of the diagnostician, and that many cases present perplexities which baffle the most acute investigation. A series of cases recorded early in the year by Mr. Jordan Lloyd of different cerebral affections treated, some very successfully, by trephining, includes one instance in which the tumour, when exposed, was found to be too extensive for removal, and another in which, although the symptoms pointed to localisation in the motor area, the tumour was found not in the expected situation but at the base of the brain. In a case in which Pilcher, of New York, trephined the left occipito-temporal region the tumour was found after death in the anterior half of the hemisphere. Another difficulty in the surgical removal of cerebral tumour is indicated in a case reported by Fischer, of Breslau, who, although the situation of the growth had been correctly diagnosed, failed to find it until a second operation, which proved very successful, was performed, at the request of the patient. At the end of last year, Dr. Bradford, of Boston, U.S., removed a growth, the situation and size of which had been previously made out by his colleague, Dr. Knapp, from the motor region on the right side of the brain. This opera tion, which was performed as a last resource in a very desperate case, proved fatal through shock. The future records of this operation should, we think, show much less unsatisfactory results. Although, as has been shown by Von Bergmann and Dr. White, cere bral tumour is removable by surgical means in but a small pro portion of cases, still, in most of these exceptional cases, the disease can -be extirpated without much risk and with incalcu lable benefit to the patient. The results in cases of cranial lesions and of cerebral abscess, of trephining performed under antiseptic conditions have been very good, and therefore we may anticipate that, with improved diagnosis, based on more extended research, and with a more careful selection of cases, surgical in tervention in cases of tumour of the brain will soon be equally successful. At the annual meeting held in Leeds Mr. Rushton Parker read notes of a case in the practice of Dr. Austin Williams, of Liverpool, in which a small cerebral tumour, supposed to have been a gumma, was removed by trephiring, with very good re sults. In March P6an, of Paris, reported a case in which a patient, suffering from epileptiform convulsions, had been cured by the removal of a fibro-lipomatous growth from the left motor region of the brain. The list of contributions to the literature of cerebral surgery made in 1889 includes two papers which are of much interest from the suggestions they give of a further exten sion of surgical means to the treatment of severe brain lesions. The JOURNAL of March 2nd contains a report by Mr. Walter G. Spencer and Professor Victor Horsley in which it is argued on anatomical, pathological, and experimental grounds that digital compression and, under favourable conditions, temporary ligature of the common carotid would be likely to prove beneficial in arresting or controlling hemorrhage from the middle cerebral artery and its branches in an early stage of apoplexy. A more recent paper by Dr. Claye Shaw, on the surgical treatment of general paralysis,' suggests the advisability of operative inter ference at an early stage of this disease, with the object of allow ing the brain to reliev-e itself from the increased arterial tension which, as has been determined by sphygmographic observation, i3 one of the early conditions in general paralysis. Reference is made in this paper to a case in which Mr. Hlarrison Cripps tre phined the right side of the cranium over the central sulcus with such success that, the patient, who had previously been rapidly approaching a condition of dementia, was after the operation con sidered as being no longer insane. In August, M. Lucas-Cham pionniere reported a case in which he had removed, with very good results, from the region of the Rolandic fissure on the left side, an old haemorrhagic focus consequent on spontaneous cere bral hemorrhage. The efficacy of surgical treatment in cases of traumatic epilepsy still remains uncertain. Dr. Terrier, though a strong advocate for trepnining in other morbid and traumatic conditions of the head, has not formed a very favourable opinion of the prospects of the operation in instances of this kind. The primary results of such treatment, though often very encouraging, are liable to be followed in the course of a few months by return of the convulsive attacks. As an instance of the benefit to be derived from operative treatment of other remote results of head injury, we would allude to a case reported by Dr. Felkin and Mr. Hare, of Edinburgh, of arrested development and partial paralysis of both limbs on the right side, in wbich considerable improve ment followed the removal of a large extra-dural cyst of trau matic origin. Spinal Surgery.-Since the summer of 1887, when MTr. Horsley removed, with brilliant results, a fibro-myxoma from the spinal cord, very little has been added to our experience of the surgical treatment of tumours in this region. Cases have been recorded by Dr. Abbe and Dr. Dealver, of the United States, in which opera tions were performed for the removed of supposed morbid growth; but in one of these the disease was a tuberculous deposit, and in the other a diffused deposit of uncertain but probably inflam matory nature. In cases of spinal caries and of old fracture of the spine trephining, or, as it has been more properly called, laminec tomy, has of late been frequently performed, and with result that confirm the statement of Dr. Macewen, a pioneer in this depart ment of surgery, that encroachments upon the lumen of the spinal canal may be removed therefrom without unduly hazarding life. Laminectomy for pressure paralysis from angular curvature has been ably advocated by Dr. Willard, of Philadelphia, and very successful cases of such treatment have been reported in the course of the year by Mr. Lane, of Guy's Hospital, and Mr. John Duncan, of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. The same operation has been performed, though not with so much success, in cases of para plegia from fracture, by Mr. Herbert Allingham, MIr. Duncan, and Dr. Dawbarn, of New York. In Mr. Ernest Hart's "Notes on Medical Paris of To-day," allusion is made 2 to a case in whicl, after removal by M. Pean of ten fragments of bone which had been driven into the cord by the bite of a horse, the patient was restored to almost his normal condition. The subject of spinal surgery in its modern developments has I een very fully and ably discussed by Dr. W. White, of Philadelphia,3 who holds that tre phining of the spine in cases of injury, of caries, and of tumour, has a rapidly widening field, and deserves more serious and careful consideration from practical surgeons than it has hitherto re ceived. There can be no (loubt that the operative treatment of injuries and diseases of the spinal column and its contents has of late attracted much attention, and that a rapid advance has been made in this branch of surgery. This advance is to be attributed not so much to improved methods of operation and of wound dressing as to the results of much careful clinical investigation, good recent instances of which are afforded by the able papers of Mr. Thorburn, of Manchester, on the extent of the disturbance of nerve function caused by lesions of the cord and by tumour of the cauda eauina, and by his recent excellent treatise on the subject. 1 JOURNAL, November 16tb. 2 JOURNAL, March 23rd. 3 Annals of Surgery.</page><page sequence="24">1466 THB BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. rDec. 28,1889. Thoracic Surgery.-But few instances have been recorded this year of successful surgical intervention in the treatment of affections of the lung. Two very important papers relating to thoracic surgery have been communicated to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, but these are interesting rather from their pathological and clinical than their therapeutical aspects. The first of these was a case related by Dr. Powell and Mr. R. J. Godlee of actinomycosis hominis affecting the right side of the chest. At a subsequent meeting of the Society Mr. Godlee brought under the notice of the Fellows a case of dermoid cyst of the right side of the chest communicating with a bronchus. Dr. Shewen, of Sydney, has reported two cases of supposed gangrene of the lung, treated with good results by incision and by resection of a portion of rib. In his comments on these cases Dr. Shewen agrees with the majority of surgeons who have had any experience of the treatment of pulmonary cavities, that the operation for gangrene possesses great advantage over that for phthisical vomica, and accounts for this advantage by the fact that in the former affection firm adhesions between the costal and pulmonary pleura are almost constantly present. Successful cases of incision of pulmonary abscess have been recorded in the JOURNAL of this year by Mr. Harris, of Exeter, and Dr. Cummins, of Cork. Opensovsky, a Russian surgeon, has published a case of pulmonary abscess and gangrene, in which, after partial resection of the fifth and sixth ribs, a large cavity was exposed in the right lung, into which the whole hand could he passed. The patient was quite well eighteen months after the date of this'operation. Abdominal Surgery.-Loreta's operation of digital divulsion of the pylorus for cicatricial stenosis has of late received much at tention from surgeons in the United States. A paper contributed by Dr. Barton, of Philadelphia, to the last volume of the Trans actions of the American Surgical Association contains in addition to the record of a successful case under the care of this surgeon, a table of twenty-four collected cases, the whole showing fifteen recoveries and ten deaths. This operation, which has been per formed twice in England, once in Australia, and, according to Dr. Barton, not at all in France or Germany, seems to deserve more consideration than has hitherto been given to it by other than Italian surgeons. The published records show that there is not so great a tendency as might be expected to relapse of the stenosis after digital divulsion, the mortality of the operation is likely to be much reduced with further experience and improved diagnosis, and, as Dr. Barton has pointed out, in every successful case the patient is rescued from certain and by no means distant death. As has been pointed out, however, this mode of treatment must of necessity be of very limited application, since non cancerous stenosis of the pylorus is a rare affection. A very satis factory case in which this operation was performed by Dr. William Gardner, of Adelaide, has very recently been reported in the JOURNAL of December 14th. On March 17th, Professor Loreta successfully dilated, at the same sitting, both the pyloric and cardiac orifices of the stomach. To the list of formidable opera tions that are now performed on the abdominal organs may be added extirpation of the cmecum, this portion of the intestinal tract, together with adjacent pieces of small intestine and colon, having been removed in Italy-twice with success, once with a fatal issue-by Durante, Bassini, and Trombetta. The important contributions of Dr. Senn, of Milwaukee, to abdominal surgery, especially those relating to operative procedures for restoring the gastro-intestinal canal after obstruction or division of continuity, have in the course of the year been brought fully and clearly under the notice of surgeons in this country by Mr. F. B. Jessett, in his able report on intestinal surgery.4 The substitution of the methods of lateral apposition and of approximation by means of bone plates for the slow and difficult procedure of direct suture of the ends of divided intestine constitutes a very decided ad vance in practical surgery, of which, however, but few surgeons have hitherto had any opportunity of taking advantage. The operation for establishing what is called intestinal anasto mosis has been performed in some few cases by Dr. Senn himself, and in the course of the year Dr. Abbe, of New York, has reported two successful cases' in which he ap plied this method. In this country gastro-enterostomy has been performed with very good results in a case of cancer of the pylorus, by Mr. Kilner Clarke, of Huddersfield.6 As the bone plates devised by Senn may not always be at hand, and as their preparation requires time and some labouir, sfforts have been made to obtain simpler and more readily available material. Dr. Abbe has used with good results rings of stiffened and aseptic catgut; and Dr. Brokaw, of St. Louis, thinks that he has improved on these as well as on the decalcified bone plates, by forming his rings of un perforated drainage tubing stiffened by strands of dried catgut. The tendency at the present time to resort to laparotomy simply as an exploratory or tentative procedure was illustrated in February at the Medical Society of London, by a case reported by Professor Annandale, and also by certain statements made in the coarse of the discussion. The case in question was one in which complete relief of very troublesome symptoms was afforded by abdominal section and the raising up of depressed .ensiform and costal car tilages. Although, as was proved by Mr. Treves, remarkable im provement may result from exploratory laparotomy in the hands of experienced and careful surgeons, another speaker, whose opinions on all questions of practical surgery must always carry great weight, was led to remark that such cases, interesting as they were, must be regarded as dangerous and likely to tempt rash operators to explore more frequently than should be done. Hepatic Surgery.-Very little has been done in the course of the year to assist surgeons to arrive at definite conclusions on the operative treatment of affections of the gall bladder. In January an interesting series of cases was published in the JOURNAL by Mr. Knowsley Thornton, who is inclined to regard with favour cholecystectomy, and would not hesitate to perform this opera tion in any instance in which the gall bladder is much damaged, or in which it is impossible to return it effectually to the ab dominal wound. A remarkable case has recently been recorded by Dr. Mears, of Philadelphia, in which cholecystotomy by the lumbar incision was performed on a distended gall bladder simu lating a floating kidney. On the subject of the surgical treatment of hydatid of the liver a valuable contribution has been made by Dr. Davies Thomas, of Adelaide, who objects to tapping as un satisfactory in its results and not always devoid of risk, and shows by statistics that the results of abdominal section are very good, the proportion of recoveries amounting to nearly 90 per cent. This subject has been discussed also by Mr. HIenry Morris, and illustrated by instructive cases. Splenectomny.-In July Sir Spencer Wells published another case of successful splenectomy, the hypertrophied organ weighing over 4lbs. The interest of this case is enhanced by a report of an examination of the blood made by Dr. Dreschfeld one year after the operation. This fluid, when examined microscopically, ap peared quite normal, the red blood corpuscles being of normal size and appearance, and the leucocytes present in normal pro portion. Renal Surgery.-At the annual meeting of the Association renal surgery was the subject of an interestiDg discussion, which was opened by Mr. Henry Morris, and in which, amongst others, Dr. David Newman and Mr. Lawson Tait took part. The chief points to which attention was directed by Mr. Morris were, the best means of overcoming certain difficulties presented from time to time in the course of the operation of nephro-lithotomy; the doubtful value of nephrectomy in advanced tubercular disease of the kidney; the indications for nephrectomy in cases of large fluid collections within and around the kidney, and the value of nephror rhaphy for movable kidney. In a paper read at a meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society on April 9th, Mr. Knowsley Thornton again supported his opinion as to the superiority of the abdominal over the lumbar method of nephrectomy by a table of. twenty-five cases. Dr. John Homans, of Boston, U.S., who has had much experience of renal surgery, has lately written in favour of the abdominal operation for the removal of every solid renal tumour which might be diagnosed as weighing a pound or more, whilst advocating the lumbar incision in cases of small tumours and those that can be reduced in size by tapping. The success which followed free division of the capsule of the kidney in a case of severe nephralgia treated by Dr. Tiffany, of the University of Maryland, has led this surgeon to account for the relief that so frequently follows an unsuccess ful attempt at nephro-lithotomy by the inference that inflamma tion of the renal pelvis and the ureter may give rise to symptoms resembling those due to calculus of the kidney. A remarkable case has been put on record by Professor Socin, of Basle, in which successful removal was performed of one-half of a horseshoe kidney affected with hydronephrosis. The patient is reported to have been in excellent health four months later. The good results of this operation, which was performed by the abdominal method, show that the existence of a horseshoe kidney is not in every 4 JOUmRNAL, July 7th. 5 JOvRNAL, November 16th.</page><page sequence="25">Dec. 28,1889.] THE BRITISI MEDICAL JOURNBAL. 1457 instance an absolute contra-indication to excision. Nephrorrhaph for the treatment of floating kidney has been advocated as a safe and successful surgical procedure by Mr. H. Morris, who has practised it in ten cases. This operation has been advocated also by Terrillon, of Paris; and Guyon, though holding that such operation is rarely indicated, states that he would not hesitate to perform it in cases in which the abnormal condition of the kidney renders life a burden. Surgery of the Urinary Organs.-The value of suprapubic cystotomy as a csnvenient and not very dangerous method of removing from the bladder calculus morbid growth, and also foreign body has been well confirmed during the year. In a case reported to the Clinical Society, in which both the perineal and high operations had beendone at different times on the same patient for tumour, Mr. W. Anderson found not only that the latter procedure gave far greater facility for examination and manipulation, but the after-progress was more satisfactory than in the procedure by the perineal route. On July 6th, Mr. Herring published in the JOURNAL a report of twenty-nine cases in which the suprapubic operation by the new method had been performed up to that date by Sir Henry Thompson, in eleven of these for tumour and in eighteen for calculus; all these, it was stated, representing the most advanced and most complicated examples of disease. Of these twenty-nine cases four were fatal. Dr. Lavista, a Mexican sur geon, reported in October a case in which he removed the blade of a large knife from the bladder by the high operation, after the failure of a previous attempt at extraction by perineal section. The main point to note with regard to urinary surgery is the im portant addition made in 1889 to our knowledge of the operative treatment of enlarged prostate. Although attention h'ad been pre viously directed to this subject, and some isolated cases of prosta tectomy had been put on record by Dr. Belfield, of Chicago, Mr. McGill, Mr. Mayo Robson, and Mr. Buckston Browne, it was not till the annual meeting at Leeds that this subject was fully de scribed and discussed. In the able and elaborate address by which this discussion was opened in the Section of Surgery, Mr. McGill advocated suprapubic cystotomy for the double purposes of drain ing the bladder and permanently removing the cause of obstruc tion, in cases of prostatic enlargement in which, through failure or uselessness of the ordinary catheter treatment, some more radical measure is indicated. The views of Mr. McGill as to the value and prospects of such treatment were supported by a list of no fewer than twenty-four cases, in which removal of the prostate by the high operation had been performed in the Leeds General Infirmary. Although the results in many of these cases seem to have been very good, and the mortality, considering the age and condition of most subjects of advanced prostatic disease, very small, it remains doubtful whether this operation will ever come into general favour, or be regarded by many surgeons as indicated even in those instances in which treatment by catheter has failed. A case has been related by Dr. M. Schmidt, of Cuxhaven, in which no relief of the bladder symptoms followed the operation. Radtcal Cure of Hernia.-The pathology and causation of hernia, more especially in relation to its attempted cure by sur gical operation, formed the subject of the lectures delivered this year by Mr. C. B. Lockwood as Hunterian Professor to the Royal College of Surgeons. The results of Mr. Lockwood's careful in vestigatious into the morbid anatomy and mode of origin of her nial swellings are very interesting, and, if confirmed by more ex tended observation, will serve to establish with much precision the indications and contra-indications of operative interference, and certainly tend to reduce the number of operations for so-called radical cure. By these investigations Mr. Lockwood has been led to the conclusion that acquired hernia has, in most instance', a pathological and not a mechanical origin, but, at the same time, is due, not so much to elongation as to a condition named prolapse of the mesentery, which consists in a slipping away at its attach ment along the spine of the root of this peritoneal membrane. If acquired hernia, in a large majority of cases, be really due to such prolapse, which, however, at present seems a somewhat obscure condition, and is attributed, for the most part, to a weakness or failure of action in a somewhat obscure muscle which probably exists only in infancy and has not hitherto been recognised in any of our handbooks of anatomy, then such forms of hernia are by no means fitted for curative operation upon the abdominal walls. On the other hand, congenital hernia, especially in adult age, when the length of the mesentery has been reduced by natural change, i8, according to Mr. Lockwood, particularly suited for remedial operation, smce this form of heriia is due to defect in the abdominal wall, and not to any fault in the mesentery or its suspensory apparatus. Cancer of the Rectum.-Mr. Jessop's opening address in the Section of Surgery at the Leeds meeting was in itself a statement of much practical value, and, moreover, gave rise to a very important discussion, in which the views of representative Britisah surgeons were expressed on excision of rectal cancer, and on the relative merits of lumbar and inguinal colotomy in the pallia tive treatment of this disease. In the opinion of those in this country who have had the m st experience of excision, cases suitable for this operation are not frequently met with, being not more, according to Mr. Cripps, than 15 or 20 per cent. of all cases of rectal cancer. Although aware of the fact that wounding and penetration of the peritoneum in proctectomy is not of necessity followed by fatal consequences, our own surgical authorities, as a rule, would recommend the adoption of this operation in those cases only in which the finger can be 'passed beyond the upper limits of the disease, and do not seem disposed to regard with favour the extensive and formidable operations that have been performed and advocated by some surgeons in Germany. The re sults, however, of this operation, even in the most favourable cases, do not seem to have been very satisfactory in consequence of the tendency to recurrence of the disease, and of subsequent incontinence. The latter objection, however, may be overcome by the performance of a preliminary colotomy, as recommended by Mr. Howard Marsh and Mr. Jessett. With regard to the palliative treatment of malignant disease of the rectum, it still remains doubtful whether inguinal colotomy will retain the favour with which it has been recently regarded by many surgeons. The lum bar operation is still advocated by Mr. Bryant, who insists on the greater risk in inguinal colotomy of cancer attacking the wound. The tendency of the external opening to contract and the frequent occurrence of prolapse'are, however, the most evident objections to the latter operation, both of which objections may be completely overcome by the ingenuity of those who have done so much towards improving the inguinal method. Operations on the Larynx.-The operative treatment of cancer of the larynx has been, in 1889, the subject of numerous papers. Early in the year the diagnosis and treatment of this disease were discussed by Frankel, of Berlin, who holds that, in most cases in which surgical intervention is indicated, partial laryngectomy is preferable to the endolaryngeal operation, and that our present experience of total removal of the larynx, showing the dangers and the subsequent tendency to recurrence of the disease, is not favourable to this operation. Some statistics, recently published by Wassermann, of Heidelberg, show that relapse is frequent after both partial and total removal of laryngeal cancer. In a case of total extirpation of the larynx, reported by Dr. Macdonald and Mr. Symonds, the patieht made a promising recovery with a useful voiee, but when seen again, alout seven months after the operation, was suffering from recurrence of the malignant disease. Boccomini, of Milan, has also reparted a case of removal of the whole of the larynx for cancer, in which the disease returned after an interval of four months. Schede, of Hamburg, has put on record a case of laryngeal cancer, the subject of which was quite well four years after complete excision. Two cases of epi thelioma, treated with very satisfactory results by thyrotomy and excision of the diseased parts, were communicated to the Clinical Society by Mr. Butlin in January last. At the same meeting the dangers of partial removal of the disease and of intra-laryngeal interference in cancer of the larynx were illustrated by two cases reported by Dr. Newmanpof Glasgow. The practice of intubation in the treatment of diphtheria has been strongly recommended by Dr. Guyer, of Zurich, who states that of twenty-seven cases of acute obstruction thus treated, thirteen ended in recovery. Tracheotomy for foreign body in bronchus was the subject of a communication in June to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society by Mr. Bryant, who mentioned a successful case in which a whistle waz extracted by forceps introduced nearly six inches beyond the lower angle of tbe tracheal wound. Grafting.-Some interesting instances of transplantation and grafting have been recorded in the course of the year. Mr. Mayo Robson has brought two cases before the Clinical Society, one of successful nerve grafting in which a defect in the median was filled up by a piece of posterior tibial nerve taken from a recently amputated limb; the other of removal of four inches and a half of flexor tendon of an injured finger to the dorsum of the hand, so as to form a new extensor for another injured finger. Wolfler, of Gratz, has recorded seven cases in which mucous membrane was 8</page><page sequence="26">i468 TiB BRITISI MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 284 1889. t'a!splanted with good results, to fill up defects caused either by injury or ulceration. Silbernik, a Russian surgeon, and Borsuk, of Warsaw, have succeeded in closing large intractable ulcets of Athe'legs by Thierech's method of transplanting long strips of skin. ,Dr. Gradenigo, of Padua, has it is stated, transplanted with good Tesilts the cornea of a hen into the human eye. PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS. Antiseptices.-Antipyretics.-IHypnotics and Cerebral Stimulant&amp;. Cardiac Remedies.-Remedies for Sweating.-Mercurial Pre parations. THE Croonian Lectures delivered before the Royal College of Physicians this year by Dr. Lauder Brunton have admittedly 'beenu-the feature of the year in English therapeutics, for their 'whole tenour was an endeavour to indicate in what direction phirmaeology was tending, so as to give into the hands of the therapeutists reliable remedies in the treatment of disease. Simple -empiricism forms still a large part of practical medicine, and must continue to do so as long as our scientific knowledge remains de ficient. But pharmacology, at one time looked down upon, is now acquiring a prominent place in the minds of thoughtful men. To those of the last generation, indeed, the object of Dr. Brunton's loctureswouldhaveappeared transcendental. As stated inhis intro duction, the object was to (1) "'try and show what principles guide us in selecting new remedies from the enormous number of sub stances known to chemistry, and (2) to indicate the lines upon which further work is desirable, in order that we may be able to manufacture substances which will not only act upon any part of the body we wish to influience, but will produce upon it any par ticular effect we may desire." The manner in which Dr. Brunton accomplished his object is evident to all careful readers of his lectures, and although all the conclusions arrived at might not be universally accepted, yet in some classes of remedies enormous progress has been made. There is no class of remedy which will better illustrate the bearing of pharmacology on therapeutics than the one which will be first considered in this report, viz., that of "Antiseptics." Ant?septics.-We are now getting a clear appreciation of the fact that the growth of organisms yields products which are deleterious to thb animal body, and which, introduced into the system in sufficient quantity, will produce death. Thus we know that the danger to wounds is chiefly from putrefactive bacteria and from the erysipelas organism. Our object in treatment is to stop the growth and produce the death of these organisms, and this we can do by means of substances-antiseptics-the effect of which can be tested on the organism or organisms outside the body in the nutrient media in which such organisms flourish. This state ment of fact may seem trite, but it has a wider, if not a more important, application. Thus organisms may obtain access from outside to the bronchi and lungs, to the alimentary tract, to the bladder, ureter, and pelvis of the kidney, and there produce symptoms of poisoning from absorption of their products of activity. Insoluble and non-toxic antiseptics (such as naphthalin) will disinfect the alimentary tract, and antiseptics eliminated by the kidney will aid in stopping the growth of organisms in the urinary tract. It is not, moreover, a priori impossible to imagine that antiseptics circulating in the blood-stream may be germicidal to pathogenic organisms, the results of which are seen in disease. Up to the present time, however, all trials with such an idea seem to have been without beneficial effect; this will be seen presently in the account of the recent antiseptic treatment of tubercular phthisis. It may be pointed out, also, that from a pathological and therapeutical standpoint it is important to remember that many organisms have been shown to produce sub stances which are detrimental to their growth; and this fact may explain recovery from poisoning by a pathogenic organism. To turn now to the work done in antiseptic remedies during the past year, we find many remedies, each of which have their particular promoter. The object of all experimentation on this class of remedies is to flnd an antiseptic which will be fatal to the organ isms, but will not be a local irritant or cause poisonous symptoms after absorption. Of the newer ones we may mention hydro naphthol, oxynaphthoic acid, sozoiodol, thio-resorcin, and myrtol. Dr. Edington I1 considers hydronaphthol an ideal antiseptic. It is soluble in water (1 in 1,100), in alcohol (1 in 2), and in oil (1 in 20). Wfen dissolved'ii4 ordiarvy water it is abotut ihalf as owerfu I a mercuric chloride (1 in 1,000); but it is as powerful as the latter in its effect on anthrax, and more powerful in its effects on bacillus subtilis. A solution of 1 in 300 in warm water may be used for washing out cavities. Hydronaphthol has the advantage of being non-poisonous. Schutsing recommends a-oxynaphthoic acid as a substitute for iodoform, overwhich it possesses the advan tage of being without odour, of having no toxic effect on the cere brum, and of being less costly. For washing out cavities, it may be used in the strength of 0.3 to one per cent., combined with phosphate of sodium. Sozoiodol in another odourless, non-poison ous substitute for iodoform. It is a combination of iodine (54 per cent.), carbolic acid (20 per cent.), and sulphur, or, more strictly speaking, it is a compound of iodine with paraphenol-sulphonic acid. Combined with sodium it may be given in 20-grain doses without any poisonous effect; but it is not yet certain whether in this form sozoiodol is an efficient antiseptic. Sozoiodol is useful applied alone, or mixed with milk-sugar in diseases of the nose and pharynx; it may be used in douche (5 to 7 per cent.). It is non-irritating to burns, and may be combined with lanolin in an ointment. Thio-resorcin is a still more recent antiseptic. It is a compound of sulphur with resorcin, and is in the form of an odourless powder, which is not poisonous. It may be used as a dusting,powder, or in ointment (10 to 20 per cent.) for eczema and parasitic skin diseases. It is very little soluble in water. The introduction of such antiseptics as sozoiodol and thio-resorcin is due to the consideration that some organic compounds of sulphur or iodine, and phenol or resorcin will in the body split up into their respective active agents, iodine and sulphur (as sulphides) being set free, act as'antiseptics, and so will phenol and resorcin. These remedies are, however, still on their trial. Myrtol is another class of compound, and has been introduced as an antiseptic for the air passages in bronchiectasis or gangrene of the lung. It may be given in capsules of two and a half grains three times daily. It hes no effect on the tubercle bacilli (Eichhorst). Passing from these recent remedies to the antiseptic treatment of phthisis, we come into the region of the indefinite. Since Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus, and of its role in the production of tubercular disease and of phthisis pulmonalis, numerous attempts have been made to destroy the bacilli within the body by means of antiseptic agents, but with no success. It is only necessary to mention the rectal injections of sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid, a treatment now happily of the past. Many attempts have been made by means of the air-passages and by the blood to introduce antiseptics to the place of growth of the bacilli, and during the past year the hot air treatment of phthisis has been brought before the profession (and laity) in England. It is well known now that tubercle bacilli will not withstand a continued temperature of 420 C. (1040 F.), so it was considered that air heated to 2000 C. and inspired might have this effect. So it undoubtedly would if air at this temperature actually reached the organisms. Apart, how ever, from the a priori consideration that the living structures of the mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchi could not with stand this heat, or even one of 1000 C. (the boiling point of water), it has been proved by U. Mosso and A. Rondelli 2 that air inspired at 2000 C. is rapidly cooled down during inspiration, so that the temperature of the lung tissue near the bronchi is not only not increased, but actually lowered as compared with the rectal tem perature. Any beneficial results ascribed to this treatment must therefore be considered as hypothetical; and it does not seem too much to say that the hot-air treatment of phthisis will soon be relegated to the past, if it has not already been so dealt with by all impartial observers. In estimating the effect of drugs used as inhalations in phthisis, a proper distinction has not in published records been usually drawn between the beneficial effect of the drug on the bronchitis which so commonly accompanies phthisis, its effect on the central nervous system as a sedative of cough, and' on the underlyingfundamental tubercularprocess. Turpentineand creasote undoubtedly benefit many phthisical patients, but it remains yet to be proved that they affect the tubercular disease itself. They may disinfect cavities comniunicating with bronchi, but how they are to get at the nodules of phthisis it is impossible to understand from what we know of the anatomy of the disease. This remark also applies, although perhaps to a less extent, to the internal administration of creasote, -whether by the mouth or by subcutaneous injection. Andreesen, indeed, concludes (as many others have concluded) that its persistent administration does benefit phthisical patients,3 but he proceeds to state his opinion .2 See abstract,in Cent. f. d. med. Wissenschaften, No. 3S, 1889, p. 698. 3 Petersburger med. Wochenschrift, No. 25, 1889. 1 JOuRNAL, May 1lth, 1889. - l'</page><page sequence="27">Dec. 28, 1889.] THE BRIYISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. 14b9 that the good effect results from the action of the drug on the stomach and intestines, stimulating the weak muscular walls, preventing putrefaction, and thus increasing the amount of food absorbed, while the drug may by its antiseptic action inhibit the development of tubercle bacilli in the intestine, and thus prevent the exhausting diarrhcea of such patients. The intrapulmonary injections of creasote (advised by Rosenbusch) are not to be recommended. The first injection may do good, but the succeeding ones are usually valueless, and may set up hemoptysis and other complications. The antiseptic treatment of phthisis, we may conclude, has not up to the present time yielded any results of permanent value. Antipyretics.-Many of the recently-introduced antipyretics (those belonging to the aromatic series of carbon compounds) are also to a greater or less extent antiseptic and analgesic. In fact, it may be said that at the present time antipyrin and antifebrin are as frequently used for their analgesic properties as their antipyretic, and many practitioners consider the pain-relieving property of these drugs of greater importance than their tempera ture - reducing. Antipyrin is now commonly administered in 10-grain doses for headache, migraine, and various other forms of neuralgia, as well in the pain due to organic as that due to functional disease. It seems, however, more beneficial in func tional disease than in the severe pains of the pressure of tumours or in the lightning pains of tabes dorsalis. It is also given hypo dermically-8 grains for each injection. After the local burning (which is common) has passed off, the seat of injection becomes antesthetic. Wolfe4 has utilised this local ancesthetic action of antipyrin in relieving the joint pain in rheumatism, the chest pains in phthisis, the cutting pains of acute pleurisy, and those of muscular rheumatism; reliet is obtained in a few minutes. No bad results were noticed from the injection, except the first smart ing caused. Antipyrin ought to be given with care, according to Demme, in all cases of weak heart or weak general condition, or in case of tendency to cardiac failure or in advanced cases of phthisis. Merkel,5 after a prolonged trial of antipyrin injections, confirms Wolfe's results in acute rheumatism, the chest pains of phthisis, and in pleuropneumonia. Before leaving antipyrin to pass on to the other analgesics, it must be remembered that this drug has a marked effect on the nervous system. It not only acts on the sensory nerve-endings, thus being a local anasthetic, but it affects the central nervous system, both the brain and the spinal cord. Batten and Bokenham d in their experiments found that antipyrin produced in animals (guinea-pigs, etc.) a spastic rigidity of the legs, appearing increased by an attempt to move the limbs. These symptoms resemble lateral sclerosis in man, so that it seems probable that antipyrin affects the motor tracts in the lateral columns of the spinal cord. Antipyrin has, moreover, an effect on some secretions. Both Haven Ross7 and Salunci 8 describe cases where 8 grains of the drug, three times daily, acted as an anti galactagogue in puerperal women. The milk secretion was much diminished on the first day in Salunci's case, and ceased on the third day. Gomier describes a case of diabetes (? glycosuria), in which the sugar totally disappeared from the urine when antipyrin was given in 15-grain doses three times daily. More information is, however, requisite on this subject, and cases of glycosuria ought to be separated from cases of true diabetes mellitus. Panas 9 treated two cases of diabetes, who had cataract, with antipyrin in daily doses of 30 to 45 grains; the diet was not altered. Sugar disappeared from the urine, in spite of the eating of carbohydrates; the thirst disappeared, and sleep became normal. At the end of Panas's paper Germain S6e lays down rules for the administration of antipyrin in cases of glycosuria. He says that antipyrin cures those cases in which the amount of sugar is not more than 80 to 100 grammes in the litre of urine (35 to 44 grains per ounce). In England such a condition is not considered as glycosuria; so large an amount as S6e's highest limit would indicate diabetes mellitus. However, S6e affirms that antipyrin given to such patients causes all the symptoms of the disease to disappear-the thirst, the poly uria, and the sugar, the increased excretion of urea, the affections of the skin and of the nervous system. There is no effect in diabetics who have wasted greatly, or who have phthisis. Robin speaks more judiciously of the treatment. He says that a com plete cure is not observed, only a suspension of the symptoms. Large doses of the drug cause loss of appetite and albuminuria, so that daily doses of between 30 and 45 grains ought to be adhered to. According to Robin, also, it is most useful at the commence ment of diabetes, and the medical treatment must be accompanied by a dietetic one. From the effects of the drug that he has noticed Robin can only consider antipyrin in the treatment of diabetes as a two-edged sword. Worms asserts that he has obtained as good results in diabetes with sulphite of quinine as with antipyrin. The truth about antipyrin probably lies between S6e's statements and Robin's; the drug benefits some cases of glycosuria and not others. Antifebrin appears also to be a local aniesthetic as well as a general analgesic. Newth"? speaks well of it in ointment (20 grains to the ounce) as an application to irritable ulcers, to psoriasis, and various forms of inflammatory skin diseases. Phenacetin is extolled by Dujardin-Beaumetz" as an antipyretic but chiefly as an analgesic. It does not, like antipyrin, derange the stomach or cause a rash; and it does not, like antifebrin, tend to cause cyanosis. In daily doses of 15 to 30 grains, it is said to relieve all sorts of pain, whether due to functional or organic disease. These results are confirmed by Ott,12 who goes so far as to say that there are few neuralgias that will not yield to phenace tin, but that in hemicrania and occipital headache the most bene ficial results are noticed. Masius, on the other hand, considers phenacetin inferior to antipyrin, both as an antipyretic and as an analgesic, so that it has yet to find its place in therapeutics. MIethacetin (para-acetphenetidin) is a recently introduced anti pyretic. It has not yet been extensively tried.'3 Exalgine is a recently introduced local and general anodyne. It is chemically ortho-methylacetanilide, CD H1, NO; and possesses both the antipyretic and analgesic characters of antipyrin. The analgesic action is, however, more pronounced than the antipy retic. In doses of 4 to 6 grains, it is beneficial in all forms of neuralgia, and no poisonous effects have been noticed from such doses. The toxic dose is abcut 56 grains for an average man, or about 71 grains for every two pounds of body weight. It is best given in warm water, to which a small quantity of alcohol is added. Hypnotics and Cerebral Stimulants.-This is a most important class of drugs, which is engaging the attention of pharmacologists and therapeutists, both at home and abroad. The Therapeutic Committee of the Association have taken hypnotics as the subject of investigation for the current year; and it is hoped that the re sults obtained will aid in determining the utility of the more re cently introduced drugs of this class. What is wanted is a safe hypnotic-a drug that will produce sleep without depressing to any great extent the heart, and without having, on the patient waking from sleep, any cerebral or motor disturbance. Such a drug is still a desideratum. Sulphonal seems to approach in its qualities nearest to what is considered a typical hypnotic. For the work which has already been done on it we must refer to two leaders which have appered in the JOURNAL this year, one on April 27th, and the other on November 2nd. Nothing of importance has been published since the last leader appeared. The subject of hypnotics was introduced as a discussion by Prof. Leech, of Man chester, at the Leeds meeting of the Association this year. Dr. Leech's able paper, which has appeared in the JOURNA-L, sets forth clearly and succinctly what is known of hypnotics and what is required to be known. The two most recently introduced hyp notics, ural and chloralamid, may be dismissed in a few words, as they are still on their trial. Ural, described by Poppi,14 is a com bination of chloral and urethan. It produces a quiet sleep in therapeutic doses, without lowering the blood pressure; and has no unpleasant after-effects, even in cases of heart-disease. Poppi has given it in hysteria and other nervous diseases. Chloralamid, C3.N02CI3, is a combination of anhydrous chloral and forma mid. It is given to adults in doses of 30 to 45 grains in water. Sleep is said to result in half an hour, and to last about eight hours. Its utility has yet to be established; but it is well spoken of by Dr. Hale White in a recent paper."

LDec. 28, 1889. paper on kola nut'6, is a valuable contribution to the caffein contaifiing class of vegetable products, such as coffee, tea, cocoa, and paraguay tea. True kola (as distinguished from " false " kola), contains a relatively large amount of caffeine; and so it is affirmed to be a tonic and stimulant to the nervous system. Sur geon Firth's experiments were undertaken with the idesof testing the advisability of giving the nut to soldiers when they were per forming hard duty, such as in forced marches. It is said to remove the sense of fatigue after marching. The results show that kola stimulates the central nervous system, augments the force of the heart-beat, thus increasing arterial tension. It does not seem to be of any benefit in convalescence, or in removing the results of alcoholism, but its astringent properties might be serviceable in cases of diarrheea. Cardiac Remedies.-Very little has been added to the main facts about strophanthus since Fraser published his research a few years ago. Most practitioners who have carefully tried the tincture speak well of it in cases of mitral regurgitation and of functional irregularity of the heart. It has been said to be useful in renal dropsy. Sde, during the discussion on strophanthus and strophan thin, at the Acad6mie de M6decine, this year, recomended strophan thin instead of strophanthus. He not only denies that the tinc ture of strophanthus is useful in cardiac disease, but says that it is apt to irritate the kidneys and produce albuminuria. Bucquoy, however, during the same discussion, stated that he found stro phanthus relieve the dyspncea of cardiac disease and cause diuresis. From these conflicting statements, it is probable that all prepara tions of the drug are not of equal value. The general English opinion seems to be that strophanthus is very useful in some cardiac cases, and with no action in others, like digitalis, in fact. Adonidin, the active principle of Adonis vernalis and A. ?estivalis, has been recommended in cases of cardiac disease. The dose is one-eighth to one-sixth of a grain in chloroform water three times daily. Like digitalis it regulates and strengthens the cardiac beat, and to a less extent than that drug it causes an increase of blood pressure by contracting the arterioles. In this last respect, therefore, adonidin stands between digitalis and strophanthus. Borgiotti recommends adonidin chiefly in case of mitral regur gitation and stenosis, in which there is great cyanosis.'7 Dr. T. Oliver found relief by adonidin from the praecordial pain, the pal pitation and dyspncea of mitral and aortic regurgitation. He concludes that the cases of aortic regurgitation in which the drug appears to be most beneficial are where the lesion is due to a rupture of the valve (traumatic) or to atheroma, and not in those cases due to rheumatic endocarditis.1' Remedies for Sweating.-The active principle of white agaric and of agaricin is, according to Hofmeister,'9 agaric acid, investi gated chemically by Fleury and Jahns. This acid may be given in pill form, each pill containg one-third or half a grain. Agaric acid is a.local irritant when subcutaneously injected, and when a very large dose is given by the mouth, it causes vomiting and diarrhoea. When absorbed, it lowers the blood pressure. It checks normal perspiration, like atropine, by acting on the secretory apparatus. A ten per cent. solution of chromic acid applied every two or three weeks is beneficial in sweating of the feet, and the method has been used with success in the German army. Mercurial Preparations.-Many attempts have been made to find a serviceable method of subcutaneously injecting mercury for the treatmentof syphilis. Bymeansof hypodermicinjectionitisasserted that the treatment of the disease is simplified owing to the fact that the injections need only be made every five to eight days, or in some cases every fortnight, while the patient is by this method more readily brought under the influence of the drug, a result which is very desirable in syphilitic affections of the brain, eye, or larynx. For some reason or other, not easily defined, the hypodermic injec tion of mercurials is not in vogue in our country, but numerous trials have been made abroad, especially in Germany, of the mode of treatment. It is obvious that the hypodermic injection of any of the more soluble preparations of mercury, such as the bichloride and bicyanide, is out of the question. Not only is there serious danger of mercurial poisoning, but the drugs cause intense local irritation, which may end in abscess. One of the latest prepara tions introduced is Lang's so-called oleum cinereum, or grey oil. It is a mixture of mercury and lanolin of each 3 parts, olive oil 4 parts, and thus contains about 30 per cent. of solid mercury. Before injection the mixture must be warmed over a spirit lamp. Speaking generally, an injection of 0.1 to 0.15 cubic centimetre is made deep into the back or nates every five to eight days; the in tervals are then made longer, and the dose increased to 1.5 to 2 cubic centimetres. There is little if any local trouble, and the effect of the mercury is soon evidenced on the syphilitic process. The preparation is also useful as an application to specific lesions difficult to get at, as in the ear, Eustachian tube, larynx and nose.&gt; Owing to the tendency to rancidity of the oil in the oleum cine reum, Neisser recommends an oleum cinereum benzoatum, which is composed of 20 parts of mercury and 40 parts of paraffin, with 5 parts of benzoin-ether.21 One cubic centimetre contains 0.3766 gramme of mercury, or about 6 grains. The dose is 0.25 cubic centimetre once; then in eight days two such doses, and so on. No abscesses were found in Harttung's experiments, and mercury was found in the urine on the third day after adminis tration. The injections cause some local induration. Beneficial results were observed, but they were not so good as when calomel was given. Frost22 says that oleum cinereum is better than a similar calomel preparation subcutaneously administered, since it does not produce such local irritation. Von Handring23 found, indeed, that with the calomel preparation, abscesses formed in 6 cases out of 274 injections, but he speaks very well of it. A fatal case of poisoning by oleum cinereum is recorded by Lukasiewicz.2' A well nourished woman, aged 46, was treated for syphilis with the oil, hypodermically; she received altogether 2.15 cubic centi metres in the course of seven weeks, altogether about 98 grains of mercury. A week after the last injection severe stomatitis ap peared, accompanied by profuse bloody diarrhcea, with tenesmus and abdominal pain; the patient rapidly succumbed. Post mor tem the kidneys were found diseased, there being small celled in terstitial infiltration with swelling of the epithelium of the con voluted tubules. The mucous membrane of the intestine was swollen. The sites of the injections were found in many cases occupied by partially or totally necrosed tissue, and in one of the last injections, 69.5 per cent. of the mercury injected was found. Such cases are admittedly rare, but several cases of stomatitis occurring after the last injection have been noticed by the same observer. For the mode of administration of salicylate of mercury, and what is called thymol-mercury, the original papers must be con sulted.25 OPHTHALMOLOGY. WE regret to have to record that the most memorable events in the ophthalmological world that have occurred in 1889 are the deaths of Professors Donders and Jacobson. In Donders we have lost an epoch-marking man, who, as such, may rank with Harvey and Jenner; one who, by reducing empiri cal knowledge to an exact science, has laid a foundation for all subsequent workers in the same subject. Such men do not die in a scientific sense; their personal presence is removed, but their influence is permanent, and that which they have added to the sum-total of human knowledge is an heirloom to unborn genera tions. Jacobson's work being essentially practical bears upon the pre sent more than upon the future. We have so recentlv given an epitome of his career that we will only now recall the fact that to him the modern improvements in the operation of cataract ex traction are in a large measure due; and, although in the march of time further modifications necessarily throw the work of the earlier operators into the shade, it would be unfair to minimise the importance of the lower steps of the ladder, and the name of Jacobson will always have a place in the history of cataract extraction. An interesting discussion took place at the annual meeting of the Association at Leeds on the subject of cataract extraction, especially on the vexed question whether iridectomy should form part of it. Leeds may in a sense be considered a stronghold of the so-called " simple" extraction, and an immense number of 20 Lang. Wiener. klin. Wochmes., 1888, No. 9. See also Central. f. d. med.

It was evident, however, that wide difterences of opinion existed on this subject, and probably no converts were made on either side. It seems that in this country the operation with iri dectomy is still by far the most frequently performed, while in America iridectomy is being more and more abandoned. There will probably always be advocates of both proceedings. Indeed, as far as mature senile cataracts are concerned, the question is chiefly one of personal preference, and each operator will obtain the best results from the proceeding in which he is most experi enced. It is not unlikely, however, that it will eventually be de termined by the bearing that it has on the treatment of immature cataracts, and at present iridectomy would here seem to present a definite advantage. Not much has been heard of washing of late out the cortex with astreamof waterin these cases, and indeed thewhole subject of immature cataract has hardly received the attention that might have been expected from its practical importance. On the subject of refraction, there is nothing new to record. Public attention has been directed to the question of the eyesight of children in board schools by a correspondence which appeared in the Standard. There are no signs, however, of any practical result; indeed, it was quite evident from the nature of the letters published that the question is one that is totally unfitted for dis cussion in a lay paper, and it seems to us that it was at least a serious error of judgment to start such a correspondence. A question in which the public are more directly concerned, as it affects their lives and pockets, is that of the vision, and more particularly the colour-vision, of sailors and railway employ6s. Thousands of lives and an immense amount of property are con stantly dependent on the ability of one man to distinguish be tween a green and a red light, yet the means taken to exclude colour-blind men from positions involving this re sponsibility are of the most flimsy description. Year by year this has been prominently brought before the authorities, hitherto without result. We are glad to say, however, that at length there are signs that some effect is being produced, and that the Board of Trade has recognised the urgent necessity for some reform in this matter. The public have begun to take an interest in the subject, and even the men themselves are anxious to see a fair and efficient test instituted. We confidently hope, therefore, that before long a thoroughly efficient test carried out be competent exami ners, will be made compulsory on all railway employ6s and seamen who are liable to be called upon to interpret signals. In speaking in this more hopeful strain, we do not forget that we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Bickerton, who for years past has laboured at the subject, and read a paper on it at the Leeds meeting. In ophthalmic literature, the year has not been prolific. Deutschsmann's monograph, Ueber die Ophthalmia Miqratoria, is a very able and complete exposition of the writer's well-known experiments and opinions on the pathology of svmpathetic oph thalmitis. It is a pity that Randolph's paper in knapp's Archives, which questioned many of Deutschsmann's facts and most of his conclusions, was published too late to be noticed by him. Among textbooks we would especially notice Mr. Berry's admirable work, and Professor Fuch's Handbuch, while from minor works we would select for special mention a little book on The Clinical U8e of Prisms by Mr. Ernest Maddox. The Bowman Lecture was given by Professor Hansen Grut, whose researches into all questions connected with the muscles of the eye are well known. It is perhaps unfortunate that the spe cial subject chosen-concomitant squint-has been so thoroughly threshed out of recent years that interest in it has a little flagged. MIDWIFERY AND GYNSECOLOGY.

Flushing the Peritoneum.-Ovariotomy in Childhood.-Ovarian 1Pathology.-Kraurosis T"ulvce.-Non-retention of Urine in Young Girls and Women.-Salpingostomy and the Conservative Surgery f the Fallopian Tubes. Electricity in Extra- Uterine Pregnancy.-Dr. Hanks' reports two cases of early extra-uterine pregnancy successfully treated by electricity. Unfortunately it is impossible to make the diagnosis with certainty at an early period of extra-uterine gestation; and all agents, electricity included, that have been used in undoubted cases to kill the fcetus, have proved exceedingly uncertain in their action. When the evidence points very strongly to extra-uterine pregnancy, at an early stage probably an exploratory abdominal section is the most satisfactory treatment. Ceesarean Section.-The question as to the justifiability of Coesarean section as an operation of election in moderately severe cases of pelvic contraction is one that is likely to assume increased importance. In some directions there is a tendency to admit that it may be right to perform Ciesarean section, although delivery by craniotomy would be quite possible, or even fairly easy. It is im possible to give any definite ratio of values as between the life of the mother and of her unborn child, but few would deny that the former is a great many times more valuable than the latter. The results of craniotomy since the introduction of antiseptics have not been shown by statistics, and it is obviously not fair to com pare the results of craniotomy in the pre-antiseptic days with the results of the modern Caesarean section. Even if the mortality of the latter operation be only from 15 to 20 per cent., this is without doubt far in excess of the death-rate of craniotomy per formed with antiseptic precautions by the best operators even in high degrees of pelvic contraction. The outcome of this line of reasoning is that C(esarean section should remain an operation of necessity and not of election. A Source of Puerperal Fever.-A series of deaths at Limehouse this year shows once again how disease in the accoucheur or mid wife may cause puerperal fever. In this instance the midwife was suffering from tertiary syphilitic mischief of the nasal passages. Even so, it is very likely that the infection was conveyed by the fingers, so that if she had thoroughly cleansed her hands and dis infected them by soaking in an efficient antiseptic, no harm would have resulted. Rupture of Uterzus.-Dr. G-reen 2 has reported a case of rupture of the uterus. The patient had a flattened pelvis; the child, weighing nine pounds, had been extracted by turning. It then appeared that rupture of the uterus had occured; the placenta had escaped into the peritoneal cavity, and lay among the intes tines. After it had been removed through the rent, nothing more seems to have been done. The patient made a good recovery. Acute Tympanites.-Dr. Charles Wicks recorded a case of acute tympanites occurring at the 6th month of pregnancy. The abdo men was punctured in four places with a medium-sized trocar. A large quantity of gas escaped, labour came on, and was easily com pleted. The patient recovered. Pernicious Anamia in Prenancy-Dr. W. Osler 3 reported nine cases of pernicious anmemia, five of which began in the puerperal period. He has found arsenic of great value in these cases. Drugs in Pregnancy.-Dr. Atthill wrote early in the year on the action of certain drugs during pregnancy, and said that in ordinary medicinal doses ergot, quinine, and strychnine would not act as emmenagogues. In corroboration, we may mention that women may even become pregnant while taking half-drachm doses of the liquid extract of ergot thrice daily. Several observations have been reported on the use of antipyrin during labour. The results obtained have not been at all uniform, for while Dr. J. 0. Winkle considers that the drug lessens the pain, and shortens the duration of the first stage, others, amongwhom are Drs. Auvard and Lefebre, have failed to obtain such results. Transfusion in Metrostaxis.-Mr. W. H. Brown, of Leeds, per formed transfusion successfully in a patient who was in a state of extreme exhaustion from heemorrhage due to a fibroid polypus. He injected 25 ounces of saline solution into the median cephalic vein. It is well to bear in mind that a simpler alternative, the in injection of saline solution into the rectum has been apparently successful in similar cases. The Line of Extension of Uterine Cancer.-Two radical opera tions are frequently performed with a view to extirpate, for a time at least, the most serious disease to which woman is subject. The first is supra-vaginal amputation of the cervix, the second total extirpation of the uterus. By cancer of the uterus, that form which begins in the cervix is understood, primary cancer of the body being very rare; besides, in the latter form the second opera ' New York MUedical Journal, January 5th, 18899. 2 New York Medical Journal.

According to the idea3 of the general surgeon, total extirpation would be the most scien tifie operation in cases of the commoner form of uterine cancer. It is, however, very difficult, and involves much manipulation in the dark. Dr. John Williams prefers supra-vaginal amputation of the cervix, as he finds that the cancer does not first extend up wards along the endometrium into the uterine cavity, but laterally into the parametric connective tissue. After amputation of the cervix, recurrence took place in that tissue, and not in the stump. This theory of the extension of cancer does not, however, corres pond with some researches of German pathologists, collected in an article published in the Deutsche medicinische Zeitung, Feb ruary 4th, 1889. Drs. Abel, Frankel, Saurenhaus, and Thiem found that even in an early stage of cancer of the cervix the endome trium was always diseased. In some cases it was already cancer ous; in the remainder, a kind of glandular endometritis was established, a very suspicious condition, which might accurately ae termed pre-cancerous. On the strength of these observations, the above-named German writers all advocated total extirpation of the uterus in cases of cancer of the cervix. There are, however, two other sides, surgical and clinical, to this question, and they cannot be overlooked. Duchamp and Rendu, of Lyons (lyon Medical), hold opinions similar to those of Williams, and also prefer, on the whole, amputation of the cervix, on clinical grounds. The Treatment of Uteriie Tuinours by Electricity.-On June 8th an article bearing this title appeared in the JOURNAL and excited great interest. for its author was Dr. Thomas Keith. Ile openly advocated electricity in the treatment cf uterine fibroids as pre ferable to hysterectomy. The latter operation showed a bigh mor tality, although the kind of disease for which it was performed seldom shortened life. Electricity, on the other hand, relieved the patient of all troublesome symptoms; in fact, it changed her whole life. Dr. Keith insisted, however, on the difficulties of the new line of treatment. The surgeon must learn the science of clec tricity; he must not merely " get up " the use of certain instru ments, nor leave the application of those instruments to a specialist. He must apply the electricity himself, and the treatment demanded great patience. It is certain that electricity employed for fibroid disease is not without danger, even when in the hands of experts. Dr. Keith's paper gave rise to much interesting correspondence and discussion. A long series of after histories is advisable before the profession can come to any decision on the relative merits of elec tricity and hysterectomy. Uterine fibroid is a very chronic disease, and many remedies, even pure therapeutics, afford temporary relief. In any case, the disease can only be satisfactorily treated by men of long experience in gynmecology. Acute Spinal Disease after Hysterectomy.-Dr. Walzberg de scribed in the Berliner klin. Wochenschrift a case where sub-acute anterior poliomyelitis set in two months after the patient had been discharged from hospital, where she had undergone hysterectomy for fibroid. The precise relation of the operation and the spinal affection does not appear to have been ascertained. The polio myelitis ultimately-disappeared. The Erzdometriumn.-The precise characters of the endometrium between and at the menstrual period, and in the earliest stages of p.egnancy, have by no 'means been accurately determined. The subject is of obvious interest to the obstetrician, and likewise im portant to the gynmecologist, nor is it without the province of medical jurisprudence. The precise distinction between different forms of dysmenorrhce%l casts, and between the most thoroughly organised of these casts and the decidua of earlypregnancy, is not very clear, considering what grave questions may depend upon such a distinction. Hence Dr. Alinot's monograph on the Histology of the Endometrium (" Uterus in Embryo: 1 Rabbit 2 Man," Joutrnal of Morphology, Boston, U.S.A., April, 1889) is an important publication. Once Dr. Minot believed that true decidual cells formed in the endometrium at the menstrual periods, and many still hold this opinion. After very careful research, Dr. Minot finds that there is no evidence that such cells develop under the circumstances. During menstruation, the uterus becomes hyper 9emic. Hyperplasia of the connective-tissue of the endometrium and hypertrophy of the uterine glands take place. The most superficial part of the endometrium appears undoubtedly to be shed. The changes during menstruation and pregnancy are homologous but the process is arrested during the former phe nomenon before a true decidua is developed. In pregnancy, the decidual cells are probably developed from the proliferating con nective-tissue cells in the endometrium. Hence gynrecologists a must be very careful in examining under the microscope suspicious shreds of membrane discharged, in the course of painful symptoms, from the uterine cavity. Dangers of the Curette.-There can be no doubt that the curette must not be lightly taken in hand for the purpose of scraping the endometrium. It involves the preliminary use of tents or dilators, and its sharp or blunt extremity deliberately wounds the uterus. Hence it is needless to point out that the use of the curette is no ",minor operation." Dol6ris and Geyl have found that this instru ment sometimes causes paralysis of the uterine walls, which comes on suddenly, so that the curette seems to go into a space, or, rather, feels as though it had perforated the uterus. Under these circum stances, the condition of the uterus favours sepsis more than ever. Uterine Pathology.-Besides Dr. Minot's valuable researches on the endometrium noted in full in this retrospect, we may note Dr. I'aul MundC's case of racemose tumour of the cervix, described in the American Journal of Obstetrics, in February. This tumour is very malignant, and Pernice, a year ago, showed that in its early stage it is made up of embryonic, striped muscular fibres. Later, its tissue assumes the character of spindle-celled sarcoma. Its grape-like clusters are invested by a common epithelial invest ment, so that this remarkzable tumour is hard to recognise before it is removed. Another interesting case of malignant uterine disease was recorded in the C'entrcilblattfiir Gynaik., No. 17, this year, by Dr. Liebman. A large uterine polypus was removed; it consisted of a stroma of plain muscle-cells, enclosing alveoli stuffed with cells of an epithelial type, a myo-carcinoma, as it might be termed. The patient died a little over a year after the operation. The lungs, ovaries, and abdominal and pelvic lymphatics were found infested with myo-carcinomatous masses. Ilushing the Peritoneum.-Mr. Lawson Tait's practice of wash ing out the peritoneum with hot water after ovariotomy and other forms of abdominal section where morbid fluids have escaped into the serous cavity or where much effusion is likely to take place has greatly spread during the past year. The Annales de Gyn6cologie for September contain an important monograph by Dr. Pierre Delbet. He has made a series of experiments to ascertain the physics and physiology of flushing the peritoneum. The fluid used for the process is diffused over the whole of the peritoneal cavity, even as far as the diaphragm. Foreign bodies cannot be entirely displaced by flushing. After the process, a considerable amount of fluid remains in the pelvis and flanks. There appears to be no danger of arresting the heart's action, as the temperature between 640 and 122' F. has no marked effect on the respiration or circulation. About 100? seems to be the best temperature. As Dr. Bantock and others have already affirmed, Dr. Delbet does not believe that M. Polaillon's case, which died after flushing, perished through that process. The water contained carbolic acid, which might have poisoned the patient, nor is there clear evidence that death did not occur through the anwsthetic. A great quantity of water is absorbed into the circulation during the first few minutes after flushing is commenced. Then a considerable amount of any poisonous antiseptic solution may be introduced into the perito neum withouLt fear of absorption, provided that it be followed by a third flushing with a seven in a thousand solutios of salt in water. Ovariotomny in Childdhood.-Dr. Hamaker reported in the New lYork Mledical -Record, September 14th, a case of ovarian tumour in a girl aged seven. Ovariotomy was successfully performed. The youngest patient on whom that operation has been success fully undertaken was one year and eight months old, the operation was performed in Berlin several years ago by Kister, and has been quoted in several well-known textbooks. The subject turns on f he question how, abdominal section is born in infancy. According to the statistics published by Dr. Stolypinsky (Centralblatt f. Gyniik., No. 11, 1889), and Lindfors (ibid. No. 28), new-born infants. bear radical operations for congenital umbilical hernia very well. Dunlap and Phenomenoff have both operated successfully on infants one hour old; both operations were true abdominal sec tions, the peritoneal cavity, as well as the hernial sac, being freely explored. As several cases of congenital ovarian tumours, well pedunculated, have been described, it is probable that ovariotomy at a very early age may prove safe and justifiable. Ovarian Patholoy.-Dr. Sippel has contributed to the Central blatt f. Gynik-., No. 18, 1889, an interesting paper on supernu merary ovaries. Mr. Doran described in the JOURNAL, June 8th, a case where he successfully removed a large fibroma of the utero-ovarian ligament. M. Terrillon removed a solid ovarian i tumour (Bulletin de la Soc. Anatom. de Paris, January, part 2),</page><page sequence="31">D,c. 28, 1889.] THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. 1463 which consisted of interlacing bundles of well-formed, striped muscular issue. Kraurosis Vulvce.-In examining the external organs of young women, it is not rare to discover a singular change in the vulva, which assumes the appearances naturally seen in old age. The labia minora are chiefly affected, and the atrophic degeneration of the vestibular structures causes gaping of the meatus urinarius and consequent irritation. To this condition Dr. Breisky has given the name "kraurosis vulvze." In th ecourse of the past year, Dr. Janovsky, of Prague, published, in the Monatscheft f. pratische Dermcttologie, some observations on six cases. In one of these cases, oedema followed by a sclerotic process and conse quent atrophy of the aff ected tissues seemed to have occurred; but the etiology was in no case very clear. C aronic venereal discharges and ulcers appeared to predispose to kraurosis. Therapeutic measures proved perfectly unavailing. NTon-retention of Ur ine in Y-ounzg Gi lIs and Wonzen.-Dr. Harry Marion Sims found that in cases of simple enuresis in girls, as well as in instances of irritable bladder after cystitis in age, the bladder was small and contracted through hypertrophy of the muscular coat, so that its holding power was much reduced. He has successfully treated suclh cases (Amer. Journ. Obstet., Sep tember, 1889), by gradual dilatation of the bladder. A silver catheter was introduced into the bladder and warm water injected by means of a Higginson's syringe. The treatment was continned daily, the amount of fluid which was injected being steadily increased, and in one case, a bladder which could hold less than two ounces at first, could retain eighteen at the end of three months. When the bladder was thus distended to a certain extent, involuntary micturiction ceased. Salpinyostomny and the COnservative ASurgery qf the Fallopian Tubes.-Removal of the tubes is certainly justifiable in many cases of salpingitis and hydrosalpinx, and more assuredly in pyosalpinx. Still it is much to be desired that surgeons could find a way of laying an obstructed tube open so that it could resume its normal functions. Hitherto, tentative operations have proved impossible, or more dangerous than amputation of the tubes, according to Mr. Lawson Tait and other authorities. Dr. Skutsch, of Jena, in one case, emptied two dilated tubes, and on each side cut a piece out of the tubal wall near the ostium. The mucous and serous coats were united along the edges of the artifical ostium by fine silk. A sound was then passed through the opening, along the tube into the uterus. The results appear to be satisfactory. Dr. Skutsch terms this operation " salpingostomy" (Centralblatt filr Gyniiko logie, 1889, p. 565). It may be a step in the right direction, but should there be a trace of suppuration in the tube, this pro-eeding would be most perilous and in any case local inflammation would very likely ensue, a complication which could hardly fail to close the tubes once more, so that the patient would be wcrse off than before the operation. Obstetricacl Society of London-.In February, Dr. John Williams resigned the presidency to Dr. Galabin, who delivered an address on modern progress in obstetrics and gynPecology, in which he dwalt especially on the perfection of Caesarean section and the lessening of mortality in cases of extra-uterine pregnancy. A valuable dis cussion took place on a paper by Professor Stephenson, of Aberdeen, on the relation between chlorosis and menstruation. A very long and active discussion followed the reading of an essay by Dr. Champneys, on a case of Caesarean section for contracted pelvis . Dr. John Phillips contributed a careful paper on acute non-septic pulmonary disorders as complications of the puerperium. A paper by Dr. Herbert Spencer on the diagnosis of placenta prcevia by palpation of the abdomen also led to an active discussion. The discussion was all the more remarkable in that several leading obstetrical authorities took part in it, and differed widely on some of the simplest and most fundamental questions. Mr. Doran read a paper on a form of localised peritonitis which simulated abdominal tumours. He also read a paper on the changes which the Fallopian tube undergoes in chronic inflammation. A great number of inte resting cases have also been reported and discussed, especially a remarkable series of teratological specimens. British Gyncecological Society.-The inaugural address of the President, Dr. A. V. AMacan (Master of the Rotunda, Dublin), was devoted to an advocacy of the value of bimanual examination of the pelvic organs, and to some methods of treatment which may be termed direct developments of the process, as in breaking down bands of adhesions in cases of fixed retroflexion of the uterus, and in the case of prolapsed and fixed ovaries. A second development is the use of massage in the treatment of chronic pelvic inflam mation, as originally introduced by Thure-Brandt, of Stockholm. Later in the session an exhaustive paper, on massage, its use and abuse in gynTccological practice, was read by Dr. AMacnaughton Jones. Dr. Bantock's last paper on ovariotomy, showing a morta lity of 4 per cent. in the last hundred cases, and Mlr. Lawson Tait's work on the subject of ectopic gestation, with a large array of illustrative specimens, may be given as proofs of the utility of this Society, and of the success which is attending gynawcolo gical study. The subject of hysterectomy for fibrous tumours has been illustrated with specimens by Dr. Bantock, Dr. R. T. Smith, Dr. Fenton, Air. Lawson Tait, and Mlr. Bowreman Jessett; Mr. Jessett's case was associated with fTccal fistula, and some others were referred to. Specimens were shown of pregnant uteri removed by Dr. Fancourt Barnes for a fibroid tumour, and by Dr. Murphy, of Sunderland, and Dr. Bedford Fenwick, in cases, res peetively, of obstruction due to cancer of the cervix, and to an impervious uterine opening after amputation of the cervix for epithelioma. Dr. Edis, and Surgeon-Major Joubert, of the Eden Hospital, Calcutta, contributed cases of extra-uterine gestation, in addition to others shown by Mr. Law.son Tait and Dr. Bantock. The vast advance made in recent years in the discrimination and treatment of small pelvic " lumps," inflammatory or new growths, is evident in the complete relief given so frequently by abdominal section. Mr. Tait showed several tubes distended with pus; Dr. Heywood Smith, a most interesting case of primary tubercular salpingitis; Dr. Bantock, a case of double h[emorrhagic eystoma of the ovaries; and numerous specimens of small excessively painfully dermoid tumours were exhibited by Dr. Mansell Moullin and others. Papers were read on nervous disorders associated with uterine ailments by Dr. Routh, Dr. R. T. Smith, and Dr. Bevington, and numerous communications of general interest were also con tributed. The Society has now acquired a local habitation for its library at the new house of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in Hanover Square, where, on and after January 1st, its collection of works on gyncecology will be more readily available. BACTERIOLOGY. Psorosperrnosi. s.-Pyocyanic Bacillus.- Diphtheria.-Puerperal Fever.-Tuiercular Disease of Joints.-Bacillus of Tubercle. Bacteria in Spring Water.-Bacilli after Death of Organism. Bacillus lIfesentericus Vulgatus. Psorospermosis.-The parasites known as psorospermiae have been frequently observed, but not rightly interpreted, until quite recently. Bollinger and Neisser, who attributed the varioliform acne of Bazin to the presence of these parasites, were the first who accurately observed it. These parasites present the form of granular cells, with a nucleus or refracting granule, in which a nucleolus cannot be detected. Excellent histologists, have con sidered these cells to be degenerated Malpighian cells. Ml. Malasser has observed granulated bodies in epithelial tumours closely resembling the parasites found in rabbit's liver, and in rats infected with psorospermie, but in the large number of these tumours M. Malassez has examined, it was in one only that he clearly detected the presence of psorosDermike. M. Darier, at a meeting of the Biological Society, read a paper on a form of cutaneous psoro spermize, diagnosed as sebaceous acne. In this case there was not the slightest doubt concerning the parasitic cellular bodies observed, or as to their role in the pathological development of this affection. The lesions were similar to those observed in psorosper mosis of rabbit's liver. Epithelial proliferation from the parasite, leading to fungoid growth, was observed in the epidermis of M. Darier's patient. The question of inoculating in order to produce in animals a disease similar to that observed in. the human race presents many difficulties, which have been clearly stated by NI. Malassez. Before inoculation, these parasites must be cultivated in many different media in order that they may be submitted to different stages of transformation, and these media are, for the greater part unknown. Pyocyanic Bacillus.-The pyocyanic bacillus studied by M. Charrin secretes a colouring substance, easily detected by certain reagents. Chloroform dissolves this substance, and when treated with acidulated water loses the coloration which is taken up by tViis latter. This microbe is easily cultivated, and produces a characteristic series of symptoms. M. Charrin has demonstrated' that the virulence of this bacillus increases or decreases according to 1 La Maladie Pyocyanique, Paris, 1889.</page><page sequence="32">14M4 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28, 1889. the surrounding conditions. This has already been observed in other bacteria, and it is interesting to learn that M. Charrin has ascer tained that a new microbe behaves in the same manner. The pyo cyanic bacillus has the singular property of developing diseases in a number of animals far removed from each other in the zoologi cal scale, and also by physiological differentiation. It attacks pigeons, rabbits, and frogs; and, curiously enough, in order to pro duce any effect on pigeons which have a higher tempera ture than rabbits, or on frogs, which have a lower, a stronger dose is necessary than for rabbits. The phenomena caused by the presence of this bacillus vary in each class of animal. In man it determines blue suppuration, in pigeons a tendency to sleep and loss of appetite: frogs are rendered inert and grow thin; the lesions are enteritis and epithelial nephritis, and cachexia, sometimes hmemorrhage and degeneration. The origin of these secondary lesions M. Charrin does not consider clearly demonstrated by his experiments. The presence of another microbe, and different idiosyncrasies of these different animals, he regards as probable factors. With regard to inoculation, M. Chamn's experiments indicate that the vaccine substance which is to confer immunity is elaborated by the bacillus; that the theory of immunity by substances proceeding from the micro organism acting as antiseptics is not tenable; neither- is the one which supposes immunity to be due to substances taken up from the body. Further experiments showed that the pyocyanic bacillus acts on charbon virus, and that the one infectious disease may be, to a certain extent, combated by another. Diphtheria.-MM. Roux and Yersin have published in the Annales de l'Institut Pasteur two memoirs entitled "Contribu tion a l'l:tude de la Diphtherie," in which they minutely describe their method of research and the results they afforded. The bacillus of diphtheria cultivated in broth renders it acid, after wards alkaline; in the alkaline state it is excessively toxic in consequence of the soluble products contained in it. These products, used for inoculating guinea-pigs, rabbits, and small birds, produce, according to the dose, acute diphtheria or a chronic septic condition accompanied by characteristic paralysis. A series of experiments made by these investigators show that the bacillus of diphtberia secretes soluble toxic sub stances. These MM. Roux and Yersin supposed might pro bably resemble a ferment. They sought to ascertain in the organs of patients dead from diphtheria the presence of the same diphtheritic virus that was detected in the microbe cultivations. The spleen of a child which had died from diphtheria was mace rated and crushed in water, then filtered; 8 cubic centimetres of the fluid were inoculated under the skin of a guinea-pig; 30 cubic centimetres were injected into the veins of a rabbit. The guinea pig grew thin and died five days after the injection; the rabbit lived two months; the hind legs became paralysed. When the diphtheritic virus is filtered away from the cultivation broth, it remains intact a considerable time, provided it is not in contact with the air. This virus is most virulent in an alkaline medium; in an acid medium a strong dose is necessary to kill the animals under experiment. MM. Roux and Yersin suppose that the Rlkaline properties of the cultivation fluid are due to the oxida tion of the nitrogenous substances contained in the broth. Culti vations made out of contact with the air are not alkaline. In cultivations two or three months old crystals of ammonia magnesian phosphate appear. Filtered cultivation fluid mixed with lactic or tartaric acid injected into guinea-pigs, caused slight cedema; a dose of half the quantity in which the acid was neutralised caused death in a short time. The longer diphtheritic virus remains in contact with an acid the weaker it becomes; carbolic and boric acid and borax retard the toxic action but do not arrest it. Introduced into the digestive tract diphthe ritic virus does not produce anydisturbance even inlarge quantities. In certain respects this virus appears to resemble diastase, although it does not change sugar nor albuminoid substances; it acts speci ally on the coats of vessels, causing vascular dilatation, h.emor rhage, and cedema, resembling somewhat the action of venom. Animals do not get accustomed to the influence of this virus. This is frequently manifested after inoculation. MM. Widal and Chantemesse, in a series of careful researches on the bacillus of diphtheria have observed that the solution of Dr. Soulez (de Romorantin), which consists of 5 grammes of carbolic acid, 20 grammes of camphor, 30 grammes of olive oil, does not arrest the cultivation of the bacillus, but renders it slower; nor does the addition of tartaric acid according to M. Gaucher's mnethod increase the antiseptic properties of the solution. These investigators think that this negative result is owing to the pre sence of olive oil and fatty bodies. Oils are bad sterilising media, because they do not moisten the cells. Camphorated naphthol has been used with satisfactory results in M. Chauffard's wards in the Broussais Hospital. MM. Widal and Chantemesse in their laboratory experiments found the following mixture the most successful: 25 grammes of glycerine, 5 grammes of carbolic acid, 20 grammes of camphor. The mixture is shaken for ten minutes in a water-bath. When cold this mixture separates into two layers-a lower and an upper; the former fluid, the latter white and viscous-a compound of glycerine, phenol, and camphor. Silk threads impregnated with the virus of diphtheria were plunged for 20 seconds in this mixture, then washed in alcohol at 950, and used for inoculating a tube of broth; but the broth remained sterile. Nevertheless, alcohol at 950 does not kill the bacillus of diph theria. This mixture has not yet been used in treating diphtheria, but MM. Widal and Chantemesse say it is slightly caustic, and adheres to the surface with which it is contact. It may be applied twice a day to the throat. Every day the throat should be well wa3hed out with a solution of naphthol, or of carbolic acid. ln order that the antiseptic agents may come in contact with the mucous membrane, the false membranes should be removed by means of a tampon of wool Herr Kolisko and Herr Paltauf,2 in fifty cases of diphtheria, studied in the course of two years resear ches on croup and diphtheria, invariably found L6ffler's bacillus in every form of diphtheria which fell under their notice. In a case of vaginal diphtheria it was absent. Widal's researches have proved that this form of diphtheria is due to the presence of the streptococcus pyogenes. Loffler's bacillus develops easily in the serum of blood mixed with a quart of nourishing sweetened broth, also in pleuritic effusion mixed with peptone and sugar. Near the false membranes or in the mucous membrane, MM. Kolisko and Paltauf have observed, in addition to L6ffler's bacillus, staphylococci and streptococci; in the liver they only observed it once. Inoculations with pure cultivations of Loffler's bacillus only caused inflammation, but the cultivation fluid, passed through a porcelain filter used for inoculation, killed the animals under experiment. Staphylococci and streptococci are inert. Kolisko and Paltauf believe that Loffler's bacillus is the sole cause of diphtheria. Puerperal Fever.-M. Widal 3 believes puerperal infection to be produced by the streptococcus pyogenes entering the animal economy by first lodging in the ulcerated uterine mucous mem brane. The diffusion of the micro-organism by the uterine vessels explains the disuribution of this affection in various organs. M. Widal has observed that the false membrane sometimes present in puerperal fever has no analogy with the false membrane of diphtheria. The puerperal false membrane and the pus of the abscesses are of the same origin, and are produced by the strepto coccus pyogenes. M. Widal Uas examined the veins in a number of cases of puerperal phlegmasia alba dolens, and has ascertained that the origin of this affection is always due to the presence of the streptococcus pyogenes in the endothelium of the vein; the clot forms after inflammation has set in. The difference between themildestform of phlegmasia alba dolensandthemost seriousform of suppurative phlebitis is only a question of degree. The clot sometimes3rchanges into true pus, not a fluid containing pus corpuscles. According to M. Widal the streptococcus which produces erysipelatous dermatitis can, unassociated with other microbes, produces suppuration in phlegmonous erysipelas. The streptococcus, isolated from puerperal discharges, produces erysi pelas, in the same way as does the streptococcus isolated from a patch of erysipelas. Tubercular Disease of JToints.-Dr. Pawlowsky4 has observed that tuberculous affections of the articulations are of a mixed character. In 1887 he examined different portions of fungoid growth removed from joints. He observed the presence not only of the bacillus tuberculosis, but also of streptococci; in one case there were onlya few, but in another the bacillus was present in large numbers; its extremities were rounded. Rabbits inocu lated from pure cultivations of this bacillus died eleven or fifteen days after from generalised infection; their organs con tained the microbes of inoculation. In another series of experi 2 Zum Wesen des Croups und der Diphtherie, Wiener ktinische Wochenschrift, No. 8, 1889. 3 Etude sur l'infection puerperale de phlegmasia alba dolens (These de la Faculte de Medecine, Paris, 1879). 4 Sur les Formes Mixtes de la Tuberculose des Articulations, Annales de l'Istitut Pasteur, No. 10, 1889.</page><page sequence="33">Dec. 28, 1889.] TIBE JBITISH MEDICAL JOtTUNAL. 1466 ments Dr. Pawlowsky inoculated pure cultivations of the bacillus tuberculosis mixed with pure cultivations of streptococcus pyo genes, staphylococcus aureus, and the pyocyanic bacillus, and observed that the animal which had been inoculated with the bacillus tuberculosis and the pyocyanic bacillus became the most rapidly ill; it died on the twelfth day after inoculation. The necropsy showed that there was suppuration of the knee-joint and grey tubercles in the lungs; the pus of the articulation con tained the pyocyanic bacillus. The inoculation of the bacillus tuberculosis and the streptococcus resulted in an enormous swell ing, and death ensued fifty-two days after. The joint was full of cheesy masses. Cultivations of pure bacillus tuberculosis, inocu lated into the knee-joint, produced death three months after from miliary tuberculosis of the lungs, kidneys, and articulations. The result of M. Pawlowsky's research is to demonstrate the existence of mixed tuberculous affections, also to prove that not only do they render local symptoms more complex but they lessen the general power of resistance. Bacillus of Tubercle.-Hammerschlag 5 made a series of interesting researches in Professor Nencki's laboratory at Berne, on the media favourable to the development of the bacillus of tuberculosis. This bacillus develops in a mixture containing 5 per cent. of glycerine in broth solidi fied by agar-agar, also in ordinary nutrient broth to which has been added 5 per cent. of glycerine, but not solidified. MM. Roux and Nocard have observed that the glycerine can be replaced by mannite or fruit sugar, soda, or potash salts. If trypsin is substituted for peptone, the bacillus does not appear. but in a decoction of yeast and water containing 5 per cent. of glycerine, this micro-organism develops rapidly. An analysis of tlese bacilli gives 88.82 per cent of water and 11.18 per cent. of dry substance; of this latter, 22.7 per cent. was soluble in alcohol arnd ether. After extraction by alcohol and ether, the residuum contained 8 per cent. of ashes, 51.02 per cent. of carbon, 8.07 per cent. of hydrogen, and 9.09 per cent. of nitrogen; the alcoholic extract had a toxic effect on animals; apparently it contained a tetanising substance. Bacteria in Spring Water.-Herr Karlinsky JustynG examined five samples of spring water of Lunsbruch, and observed in these samples seven different kinds of bacteria. Having ascertained what were the normal bacteria contained in the water, he placed in it pathogenic microbes; typhoid fever bacilli decreased in number, and finally disappeared towards the sixth day. With cholera bacilli there was a more rapid disappearance; on the third there were none to be seen; the bacillus anthracis also disap peared about the third day. These results coincide with those ob tained by Krauss, and most probably are explained by the presence of the bacteria indigenous to the water, which destroy the patho genic bacteria, as in the case of anthrax. Herr Justyn experi mented not with cultivations of anthrax, but with blood taken from an animal infected with anthrax. Bacilli after -Death of Organism.-E. von Esmarch7 has investi gated the history of bacilli after the death of the body containing them. He naturally limited his researches to the study of patho genic microbes. The bacilli of septiceemia of mice in a dead mouse, which decompose slowly in the earth, are, ninety days after burial, still virulent, but lose their virulence when this time has elapsed if the dead bodybe kept in water. If thebodybe placed in a stove the virulence disappears eight days after. The micro-organism of the swine plague buried three metres under ground preserves its vitality during three months. Eighteen days was the longest time that Esmarch observed charbon bacilli remain virulent after the death of the animal containing them. The blood vessels from which this infected blood was taken had been kept in ice during that time, otherwise the virulence would have disappeared sooner. M. Pasteur has demonstrated that with this bacillus there is an absence of spore formation if air be excluded. Apparently the rapidity of the destruction of the bacilli is in proportion to the degree of decomposition. Gartner observed that bacteridia in the bodies of dead animals lost their virulence twelve days after death. Von Esmarch has seen silk threads impregnated with charbon spore and enclosed in the body of a dead animal multiply after eighteen days. In animals buried the earth spores do not multiply. The micro-organism of fowl cbolera in infected bodies and putrid fluids live a lotg time-from four to six weeks. Von Esmarch concludes from his researches that after death patho genic microbes disappear quickly; the more intense the putre faction that takes place the quicker is their disappearance. De composition is not the sole factor in this destruction of microbes; a fragment of liver containing charbon bacteridia was inclosed in agar-agar; when examined three weeks after it was impossible to obtain a single colony from it. Bacillus Mesentertcus Vulqatus.-An important contribution to bacteriology has been made by M. William Vignal, in a thesis pre sented to the Faculty of Science of Paris for ,the Doctor's degree. Dr. Vignal has hitherto confined his researches to bacilli found in normal tissue, probably believing that in the study of bacteri ology, as in other departments of science, the normal should be an anterior study to the abnormal. The bacillus "mesentericus vulgatus," named by Dr. Koch "K Kartoffel bacillus" because it is easily cultivated in potato, is one of the micro-organisms most frequently met .with. It exists in water, air, the alimentary canal, and in substances beginning to putrefy. A pinch of earth taken from the Luxembourg gardens contained 313 colonies of micro-organisms; of these, 41 were of the mesentericus vulgatus. In earth taken from a field, in 287 colonies there were 31 of this bacillus. In the Paris atmosphere this bacillus exists in the pro portion of 4 in 70; in Seine water in 13 in 442. In corn, bran, and flour a large number of this bacillus is found. M. Vignal describes in detail how to cultivate this bacillus, its behaviour in different media, its multiplication by division and spore formation. The multiplication by division observes the rule which holds good in all plants. In the middle of a long bacillus a septumr appears which divides in two and gives birth to two bacilli; these when they equal in size the cell from which they proceed, in their turn become subdivided. This phenomenon is repeated in every successive generation. The spores of this bacillus are observed in cultivations a few days ald; they appear at the same time as the division of the bacilli takes place, and thus furnish conclusive proof that the spores are not bodies engendered by bacilli when the nourishing media is impoverished. Dr. Vignal considers the spores to be a stage of development of these bacilli or plants in which they are less easily attacked than when they reach the condition of bacilli, in the same way that seeds of plants offer more resistance to ex: ternal influences than the plants from which they proceed. The spores are not coloured by ordinary methods until they are dead. From the data given by M. Vignal concerning this bacillus, it is evident that one of the ferments of albuminoid substance, the tyro thrix tenuis, discovered by Duclaux, resembles closely the mesen tericus vulgatus, but M. Vignal does not think that it is the same bacillus. in a series of experiments made on the respiration of the bacillus mesentericus vulgatus, M. Vignal observed that 1 gramme of this plant dried at a temperature of 1000, and cultivated in broth, containing 21 to 24 grammes of solid and combustible bodies per litre, fixed 1,164.29 cubic centimetres of oxygen, and transformed 7,147.28 cubic centim6tres into carbonic acid. If the proportion of combustible substances is increased to 24.15 grammes, the quantity of oxygen fixed is also increased to 1,602; likewise the quantity of oxygen transformed into carbonic acid, but this latter in a larger proportion; it reaches 12,849.70 cubic centimetres. The physiological activity of one gramme of this plant is as much greater than that of one gramme of tissue of an adult man, that in the same given time it consumes 215 times as much. Albumen in the presence of the mesentericus vulgatus becomes dissolved, and this is apparently due to the influence of a ferment secreted by this micro organism; fibrin is also dissolved. This bacillus coagulates milk very quickly, two layers are formed, the coagulum under neath, the fluid portion on the top; on the third day the coagulum breaks down; on the fifth the casein is completely dissolved; a small proportion of lactic acid is always formed in the milk. Casein coagulated by lactic acid is also dissolved by this micro organism if the acid be neutralised; coagulated casein dissolved in an alkaline salt solution is also attacked by the mesentericus vulgatus. Sugar is transformed into dextrose and levulose by the action of this bacillus. This takes place whether the sugar solu tion be weak or strong. Only a small quantity of saccharose is burned or utilised per diem by this bacillus ; 25.35 grammes of sac charin were consumed in 110 days. Cooked starch is also trans formed into a substance capable of reducing Fehling's fluid pro bably to glucose, maltose, and dextrine. Among, the many import ant facts concerning this micro-organism discovered by M.

The nature of the food given to this bacillus has a certain influence on the quantity and quality of the ferments it secretes. In veal broth it secretes an amylolytic ferment, a rennet, a ferment which disintegrates young vegetable cells, and another ferment which prevents casein from solidifying. If a small quantity of starch and sugar be added, the quantity of amyl ferments is increased. But the influence of food in the secretion of is most evident with milk. One part of broth in this only micro-organism has been cultivated, only coagulates thirty parts of milk. One part of casein solution coagulates sixty parts of milk, one part of coagulated milk in which also this micro-organism has been cultivated coagulates 140 parts of milk; one part of neutralised milk coagulates 1,200 parts of milk. Besides the rennet and casein, the milk in which the bacillus has been cultivated contains an amylolytic ferment. When nourished on raw potatoes this bacillus secretes a small quantity of amylolytic ferment, and a ferment which disinte grates vegetable cells. The same weight of mesentericus vulgatus as that ot a dog's pancreas in full activity secretes in five days either only halt the quantity of amylolitic ferment secreted by the pancreas, or the pancreatic ferment is twice as energetic. This short summary will show how Dr. Vignal's researches suggest general conclusions concerning the role of microbes in the diges tive function, though the author is too careful a scientist to anticipate the existence of phenomena not yet proved; he con siders the question, What is the part played by the glands and by the micro-organisms respectively of the intestinal tract in digestion? too complex to be solved without more extended study.

Legislation in 1889.-Several important measures affecting sani tary administration have been passed into law by Parliament during the past year. Unfortunately, time was not found for the completion of the reform of the English system of local govern ment, of which the Local Government Act of 1888 was the first instalment. But by the Local Government (Scotland) Act, Scot land has been granted a system of county government very similar to that granted to England and Wales in 1888. As originally introduced, however, the Scotch Bill was very defective, and proposed to perpetuate several arrangements which would have been most inimical to good sanitary administration. Happily, the strenuous efforts of the Parliamentary Bills Committee of the British Medical Association, supported as they were by the West of Scotland Branch, and by several influential members of Parlia ment, especially Dr. Farquharson and Sir Walter Foster, succeeded in securing several very important modifications of the original proposal. The clause empowering the new County Councils to appoint a medical officer of health was made compulsory instead of permissive-" shall appoint " was substituted for "may appoint " -and a further clause was introduced, providing that medical officers and sanitary inspectors appointed under that Act or underthe Public Health Acts, shall be removable from office only by the central author ity-the Board of Supervision. In both these instances Scotland has obtained what was denied England in 1888; but further efforts will be made, when opportunity offers, to obtain the reasonable security of tenure of office for English health officers, which has been extended to those of Scotland, and is already enjoyed by poor law medical officers. Lunacy Acts Amendment Act.-It is satisfactory that in this case also, the efforts of the Parliamentary Bills Committee were rewarded by securing the adoption of several very important modifications of the original proposals-modifications which are desirable in the interests not only of the medical profession, but also of the insane. These amendments have been fully discussed from time to time in the pages of the JOURNAL. Infectious Disease (Notification) Act.-The expediency of the prompt notification to the local sanitary authority of the occurrence of cases of infectious disease has long been recognised. By the Act of last session, the notification was made compulsory through out the metropolis after October 31st, and in any extra-metro politan district, so soon as it is adopted by the local sanitary authority. The " dual "' system of notification, is the one adopted in the Act, and although there are obvious objections to the imposition of the duty of notification on the medical attendant, medical practitioners will be found ready to carry out loyally the duty in this matter, which Parliament has thought fit to impose upon them. Up to the present time (the middle of December), the Act has been voluntarily adopted by nearly five hundred extra metropolitan sanitary authorities, with an aggregate population of six millions. If to this be added the four millions of Londoners, and the four millions of residents in the fifty-nine large towns where the system is compulsory by virtue of local Acts, it will be seen that nearly a half of the population of England and Wales is subject to compul sory notification of infectious disease. Poor Law Act.-By this Act, the action of the MLetropolitan Asylums Board in receiving cases of diphtheria into their hospitals, has been legalised. The Board are also authorised to allow their hospitals to be used for the purposes of medical instruction, and they are further empowered to allow their ambulances to be used for conveying infectious patients to other places than to the Board's hospitals. Minor Acts.-Tlhe Public I-lealth Act, 1889, which removed certain doubts in connection with the cholera regulations of the Local Government Board; the Town Police Clauses Act, authorising local authorities to make by-laws as to omnibuses; the Public Libraries Act Amendment Act; the Trust Investment Act; the Weights and Measures Act, etc., are all Acts giving increased and useful powers to local sanitary authorities, and additional benefits or protection to the community. C(ertifying Factory Surgeons.-A proposal which was made to the Home Secretary early in the year by the Manchester Cotton Spinners Association, for the abolition of the office of certifying surgeons in factories was promptly met by the Parliamentary Bills Committee, and the result of the action taken in the matter has been to prevent the suggested ill-advised step being taken. Mr. Matthews expressed his iatention of introducing a Bill to amend the Factory Acts and deal with this question, but pressure of public business prevented him from so doing. Infant Life Protection.-During the past year there have been numerous cases which have shown the insufficiency of the existing law to protect the lives of young children. Baby-farming is still practised to a very large extent, whilst the ease with which the lives of infants can be insured in the present state of the law affords a strong incitement to child-murder. The law requires considerable and speedy amendment in the direction of the draft Bill, first prepared on behalf of this JOURNAL, in order to deal with both these evils. Registration of Midwives.-The proper instruction, certification, and registration of midwives is a subject the great importance of which has long been recognised by the Parliamentary Bills Com mittee and Association. The draft Bill of the Committee has already been approved by the Privy Council and the General Medical Council, but has been delayed by parliamentary apathy. The need for some such scheme has been shown by many instances in which puerperal fever or other mischief has followed the opera tions of the ignorant midwife. The General Medical Council has recently had the question again under consideration, and has passed resolutions to the effect (1) that public safety demands from (Government the passing into law of some measure to enforce the education, licensing, and registration of midwives; and (2) that the Council would be willing to advise as to the general rules of edu cation, examination, and discipline, but that it would not under take the duties of licensing, controlling, and registering midwives. This is precisely on the lines of the draft Bill of Parliamentary Bills Committee of our association of six years ago. The Control of Noxious Gases.-The Alkali, etc., Works Regu lation Act, 1881, has been administered and enforced during the year with good results. But Mr. A. E. Fletcher, the Chief Govern ment Inspector under the Act, has pointed out that the result</page><page sequence="35">Dec. 28, 1889.] THE BRITISR MEDICAL JOURNAL. 1467 attained would be much better (without the infliction of any serious burden on manufacturers) if the Act were amended so as to enumerate the noxious gases to be controlled rather than the pro cesses of manufacture by which those gases are-generated. This is undoubtedly a matter worthy of the consideration of Parliament. Diarrhoea.-The results of the exhaustive inquiry which Dr. Ballard has been making for the Local Government Board into the causes of diarrhcea, have been embodied in a very instructive Blue Book, shewing, amongst other things, that mere heat is not a suffi cient cause of the disease, but that " the essential cause of diarrhcea resides ordinarilv in the superficial layers of the earth, where it is intimately associated with the life processes of some micro-organ ism not yet detected, captured, or isolated." Small-pox at Sheffield.-Dr. Berry's report on the epidemic of small-pox in Sheffeld in 1887-1888, was issued early in tho year, and furnished one of the most complete and telling vindica tions of vaccination that has ever been obtained. [A full notice of the report was given in the JOURNAL for April 13th, page 855.] Vaccination.-The great event of the year as regards vaccina tion has been the appointment of a Royal Commission with Lord Herschell as Chairman, to inquire into the whole question. The first report of this Commission (which is still sitting), was recently issued and fully noticed in these columns [see pages 853, et seq.]. Small-pox in 1889.-During the year only twenty deaths from small-pox occurred in the whole of England and Wales. The smallness of this number is remarkable. Foreign Epidemics.-The island of Porto Rico was visited by a severe outbreak of small-pox towards the close of 1888. The epidemic extended into the present year, and before it died out it had caused upwards of 1,000 deaths among a population of about 40,000 persons. Full particulars are not yet to hand respecting the outbreak of a disease like typhus fever (which however appears to have been plague), which occuared in the Yemen, Assyr, and other districts of Arabia in the past summer and autumn. Scarlet Fever.-In the metropolis, scarlet fever, as indicated by the returns of patients admitted to the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals, has shown the usual autumnal increase, but has not exhibited any widespread epidemic prevalence at any portion of the year. At the commencement of the year the North-Western District Hospital was practically closed, patients from this district being taken to the Western Hospital at Fulham. The inadvisa bility of entirely closing the North-Western Hospital, and the hardship of sending patients a distance of some seven miles from their homes to hospital in the ambulance carriages, were pointed out in these columns. The views then expressed were of sufficient weight to induce the managers of the Asylums Board to maintain the North-Western Hospital in a state of efficiency for the require ments of those parishes allocated to it, and also for the accommoda tion of a limited number of convalescents from other hospitals should the necessity arise. The South-Western Hospital at Stock well has more recently been opened again for the reception of patients, but the Northern Hospital at Winchmore Hill still re mains closed. Epidemics of scarlet fever have occurred at Bir mingham, Plymouth, and Glasgow, during the course of the year. In the former town the accommodation in the City Fever Hospital was exceeded, and arrangements had to be made for the reception of patients in the fever hospitals of neighbouring local authorities, and temporary buildings have also been erected for a like pur pose. In Plymouth there have been over 500 cases, and 130 deaths; a proposal to close the elementary schools was negatived by the Town Council. The epidemic in the neighbourhood of Glasgow was clearly traced by Dr. Russell to the milk of a certain farm, where were found two cows with ulcers and scabs upon their teats, similar to those described in connection with the Hendon outbreak. At Macclesfield, also, a virulent outbreak of the fever, which attacked several hundred persons, was traced to the milk supply. A somewhat novel method of propagating in fection has been brought to light by proceedings taken at the in stance of the Maidstone Rural Sanitary Authority, against a local fruit grower, for allowing his red currants to be picked in his orcbard by children who were desquamating from scarlet fever, and for sending the fruit to the London market. The case was dismissed by the magistrates, on the ground that fruit is not in cluded either specifically or generally in the meaning of Section 126 of the Public Health Act, under which the proceedings were taken. Measles.-Measles was virulently epidemic in London during the early portion of the year, and severe outbreaks have been reported from various parts of the country. Mildness of type, which was formerly a characteristic of measles, seems to have disappeared, and epidemics of this disease are now accompanied by a mortality,which calls for the most energetic measures of repression. Beyond the compulsory closing of schools, little is done during a measles outbreak. In few places is measles a notifiable disease, and isolation of cases in hospitals is very rarely attempted. In London the Metropolitan Asylums Board has refused to take any steps to secure the admission of cases of measles into its hospitals, and this in view of the fact that for three months of the past winter the deaths from measles in the metropolis averaged 133 per week, indicating a mortality far exceeding that of any epidemic of small-pox during the last seventeen years, and one nearly equal to that caused by the memorable small-pox epidemic of 1870-71. Whether the mor tality is caused by the change in type, that is, a larger proportion of severe or malignant cases in an outbreak, or by the greater fatality of the after-complications of the disease, has yet to be decided. In the provinces notable epidemics have occurred at Branston, in Lincolnshire; at Rugeley, where 50 per cent. of the children under 10 years of age were affected; in the Potteries, at Hanley, Paisley, and other places, where the wide spread of the epidemic and its unusual fatality caused almost a panic; at Warwick; at Windhill and Baddon, small townships near Brad ford; and at Glasgow, where an epidemic of whooping-cough ran concurrently with the measles. Typhus.-An outbreak of typhus occurred at Hull at the com mencement of the year; and quite recently in London several cases have been removed to hospital from a crowded slum in St. Olave's, Southwark. As usual, these outbreaks have occurred in filthy, overcrowded tenements, and prompt removal of the cases to hospital and the remedying of the insanitary conditions in the houses have served to prevent the spread of the infection. Atten tion has been drawn to the difficulties* experienced in making a diagnosis of typhus at an early stage of the disease-a difficulty which is enhanced by the want of familiarity of modern practi tioners with a disease now of some rarity except in a few large towns, and which may cause a delay in notification that enables an epidemic to make headway before measures can be taken for its suppression. There is a pressing necessity for imparting to students practical instruction in the diagnosis of typhus and other fevers. Such a course of instruction is available in some provin cial towns, and a scheme of this sort is now under the considera tion of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, whose hospitals are capable of affording the desired clinical instruction. Diphtheria.-During the whole of the year diphtheria has been very prevalent in London, and the mortality from this disease in the metropolitan returns continues to exhibit a steady rise, although isolation of cases can now be secured by their removal to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Diphtheria has been reported as very prevalent in Uxbridge and in parts of East Kent. A number of reports have been issued by the Local Government Board of investigations by their inspectors of out breaks of diphtheria. In most of these cases it was found that cases of " croup " had also been occurring, which were without much doubt cases of the more malignant disease. Especially was this the case in a prevalence of diphtheria in the Camel ford Rural District. Dr. Ballard, who made the inquiry, was at once told by one local medical practitioner that he made no dis tinction between " croup " and " diphtheria," and that he regarded these terms as synonymous. Other medical men made the same admission. Similarly, when Mr. Spear investigated a prevalence of " croup " and other throat affections at Harwich, and in other cases, it was found that no clear distinction had in all instances been drawn between diphtheria and some other affections of the throat. During the year, a very interesting and thoughtful paper by Dr. G. B. Longstaff on the geographical distribution of diph theria was issued by the Local Government Board. From that paper, it would seem as if the disease had a preference for certain special districts, the great majority of which are rural. The re lation of diphtheria to affections of the lower animals, cats, etc., was suiggested. This relationship has been observed with greater certainty in other quarters, and is still being closely investigated by Dr. Klein. The medical officer of health for part of East Kent gives instances of the disease running concurrently in isolated farm houses with disease amongst the stock (cows and horses). The evidence is gradually accumulating to establish the view that diphtheria is a disease which is transmitsible both from man to some of the lower animals, and from these in turn to man. Enteric Fever.-The condition of the Royal Barracks at Dublin</page><page sequence="36">1468 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28, 1889. has continued to attract considerable attention. Most of the troops previously stationed there have been encamped during the summer in the Phoenix Park, and are now occupying the Agricul tural Buildings. Mlr. Rogers Field has presented an interim report upon the barracks, but has been unable to discover any special cause for the long-continued prevalence of enteric fever in them. As was shownl in the report of Sir C. Cameron and Dr. Grimshaw the sanitary condition of these barracks, to a large extent. forms only a part of the larger problem of the sanitary state of Dublin generally. Dublin probably has one of the highest enteric fever death-rates of any town in the country, on account of its defective sewers and the pollution of the Liffey with sewage. Until these matters are remedied, the site of the oldest portion of the city must be unhealthy from the existence of a sewage-laden soil under and around the houses. There are, no doubt, barracks in this country which are little, if at all, superior to those in Dublin. A notable example, the Clarence Barracks at Portsmouth, have been closed this year, the insanitary condition of the buildings being at last officially recognised. Epidemics of typhoid have occurred during the past summer and autumn at St. Helens and Burnley, in Lancashire, in the prison at York Castle, and at Belfast and Carlow, in Ireland. In these cases the origin of the outbreak is attributable either to defective drainage and sewerage, or to the polluted condition of wells and water-courses. In London there has been a considerable prevalence of the disease during the past autumn in the East End. A very limited outbreak in the hlanover Square district in August attracted considerable attention, and was popularly sup posed to be due to foul emanations from unflushed sewers. In the matter of flushing sewers, London is undoubtedly much behind some provincial towns. Epidemics of typhoid, which have been traced to the milk supply, are reported as having occurred at Stirling, Leeds, and in the Strand district of London. Dr. J. R. Roberts, of the Indian Medical Service, has published an interest ing note' on the occurrence in dogs of lesions resembling those of enteric fever in the human subject, and suggests from this fact an explanation of the continued prevalence of the disease in Indian cantonments, in spite of the sanitary precautions taken. Dr. J. Cameron, in describing a limited outbreak of typhoid at Hendon, has raised the question of the identity of swine fever (porcine pneumo-enteritis) with human enteric fever. Principal Walley, in an instructive letter,2 adduces a variety of evidence to negative such a view, and agrees with Dr. Klein that swine fever has no connection with, and does not bear any sort of pathological rela tion to, human typhoid. In India enteric fever now causes a far larger mortality amongst troops than cholera. At Lucknow and other cantonments the disease is especially felt amongst the raw youths who have recently arrived from the home stations. Miuch has been done to improve the sanitary condition of the barracks, but the disease appears to be most frequently contracted in the bazaars and drinking shops in native quarters to which the soldiers have access. Yellowv lever.-Intelligence has been received during the year of a severe epidemic of yellow fever in Rio Janeiro. The first ac counts of the outbreak appear to have been exaggerated as re gards panic and business stagnation, but the mortality at one time was doubtless very great. At Santa Cruz de la Palma, an island under the Spanish Government, a serious epidemic has oc curred, the percentage of deaths to cases being very high. Four fifths of the inhabitants are said to have fled the island. Cholera.- Europe has been free from Asiatic cholera this year. A very extensive epidemic has occurred in Bagdad, Bussorah, and other parts of Mesopotamia (Asiatic Turkey), the quarantine en forced by the Ottoman Government entirely failing to limit its spread. From Bagdad the disease was imported into Persia through the western frontier, where its encroachments threaten an extension of the epidemic to central Europe. Cholera has also been very prevalent at Pekin in China, and in the Philippine Islands. Epidemic Pneumonia.-Dr. Ballard's report to the Local Govern ment Board on the epidemic of pneumonia which prevailed in Middlesbrough and its neighbourhood from January t2 July, 1888, contains some interesting information. The disease was distinctly infectious, and had an exceptional incidence on males above the age of 15. The contagion was apparently trans ported directly through the air, by means of the breath, from the sick to the healthy, and also by means of infected sewer and drain emanations. Dr. Klein discovered a bacillus in the lung juice and fresh sputa, which he regards as specific. The deaths of a medical man and his assistant at Doncaster from acute pneu monia apparently transmitted by infection from a patient have been recently recorded. Contagious Ophthalmia.-The continued prevalence of ophtlial mia in the central London district schools at Hanwell has been the subject of much comment in this JOLTRNAL. The Board of Management has for years been extremely apathetic in allowing a condition of things to remain wnich has been condemned by every expert called in to report, but has at last ordered the erec tion of temporary dwellings for the isolation of 400 ophthalmic patients, this being the number of children, out of 1,200 in the schools, who have to be isolated and systematically treated every year. From the reports of Dr. Bridges and of Mr. Nettlesliip, it appears that the schools are in a very insanitary conditioD, and that certain dormitories in the attics are very badly ventilated and much overcrowded, whilst the nursing is very defective. These schools have become a great public scandal, and it is time that the managers should exert themselves to give effect to the recommendations contained in the reports of Dr. Bridges and Mr. Nettleship. Ophthalmia is also reported to be very prevalent amongst the children in the Edmonton schools of the Strand Union. At least one-half of the children are affected, and the sick ones are allowed to bathe in the same water with the healthy ones. With so eminently preventable a disease as ophthalmia, these revelations must create a general feeling of disgust with the system of management pursued by parochial school au thorities. Epidemic Influenza.-The existence of a widespread epidemic of influenza in Russia, which is apparently spreading all over the continent of Europe, the latest reports showing that the disease has reached Austria, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark, points to the return of a contagious disorder which has not been extensively prevalent in Europe since 1848. Its progress will be watched with the greatest interest by epidemiologists, and many points in its mode of propagation, which are now obscure, will possibly be cleared up. Rabies.-Little progress has been made during the year in organ ising any effective system for the eradication of rabies from this country. Muzzling orders are still issued by local authorities, or withdrawn, at their discretion, with the result that it is our un pleasant duty from time to time to chronicle the infliction of bites by mad dogs on human beings, and to receive intelligence of occasional deaths from hydrophobia. Except to a small number of uninformed or prejudiced persons, the immense success of Pasteur's preventive inoculations is becoming more and more evi dent as time elapses; and the recognition by the Corporation of the City of London of the immense benefits conferred upon our countrymen who have undergone the treatment in Paris, and the raising of a fund to send over those who have been bitten, but are unable to afford the expense of a visit to the French capital, is one of the pleasing events of the year. It would, no doubt, have been even more satisfactory to have applied the funds to the foundation of a Pasteur Institute in London, but we must be content at pre sent with the knowledge that no one need die of hydrophobia for want of means to avail himself of MI. Pasteur's charity. During the last few months of the year the muzzling of dogs has been compulsory in the metropolis under an Order in Council with the view of stamping out rabies. The existing order expires at the close of the year, but the Board of Agriculture, to whom the powers of the Privy Council in the matter have been transferred. has happily renewed it over an extended, though possibly still inadequate, area. The refusal of the London County Council, as the local authority responsible for the execution of the order in the metropolis, to enforce it, on the plea that any order which did not include the whole country was practically useless, was logically sound enough, but did not display any sufficient sense of the needs of London in this matter. We trust that the subject is nowso far understood in all its bearings that in the comingsession Parliament will be able to legislate for the whole conntry, and, whilst providing for muzzling and the destruction of ownerless dogs, will also take steps to prevent the importation of the disease from foreign countries. Germany and Scandinavia have adopted general measures of suppression, with the result that in these countries rabies is practically eradicated. A very interesting account of an outbreak of rabies amongst the deer in the Marquis of Bristol's park at Ickworth will be found in the JOURNAL of October 12th. The disease was for some time supposed to be anthrax, and it was not until careful pathological inquiry had IJOURNAL, August 30th. 2JOURNAL, November 9th.</page><page sequence="37">Dec. 28, 1889.] THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. 1469 been made, and the matter had been put to the test of inocula tion, that the diagnosis of rabies could be definitively settled. Leprosy.-The death of Father Damien from this disease in the island of Molokai-the leper settlement of the Hawaiian Isles the almost simultaneous reading of a paper on leprosy before the Epidemiological Society, and the discovery by the general public that cases of leprosy existed in London, and that many members of the medical profession regard leprosy as a contagious disease transmissible by inocuiation, have served to concentrate attention on the subject in a manner almost unprecedented. As a conse quence, information has been received and published from many parts of the world as to the number of lepers in various States, the systems adopted for their segregation and isolation, and the views generally held as to the contagious nature or otherwise of this disease. As regards the State control of lepers our own Im perial Government, with its numberless dependencies, by no means takes first rank. Dr. Pringle's paper read to the Epidemio logical Society contains a sweeping indictment against the Indian Sanitary Departments for taking no steps to enforce the segrega tion of lepers, and for not providing sufficient asylums for their reception and treatment. According to good authorities leprosy is increasing gradually, not only in India, but at the Cape, in Egypt, Russia, Spain, and other countries. At the Cape compul sory segregation of lepers was the subject of enactment in 1884, but has not yet been enforced. Attention has been called in the public press to the neglected condition of the Cape Leper Settle ment on Robben Island. On the subject of the contagiousness of leprosy there is still no consensus of medical opinion. Experience in this country, where leprosy is by no means unknown, although the number of cases to the population is relatively very small, and the experience of practitioners in other parts of Europe, in Turkey, Syria, and Egypt gives no confirmation to the contagion theory; on the other hand, in parts of the world where leprosy is more common, evidence which appears conclusive as to the spread of leprosy by contagion is abundant, and such a view is a matter of firm belief with those on the spot who are competent to judge. The extraordinary interest manifested in the subject in London ought to bear good fruits in arousing the Government to the necessity for taking measures to extirpate the disease from its great Indian dependency. As a preliminary measure the thorough resifting of the whole subject by a competent commission of medical experts in India and other parts of the world where leprosy is prevalent is highly desirable. The best tribute this country could pay to Father Damien's memory would be the adoption of such measures as the commission might recommend for the eradication of so foul and loathsome a disease. The Housing of the Working Classes.-Again this important question has come prominently to the front, and is attracting a degree of attention which it has not received since the last great impetus to reform in 1884. Improved dwellings for the working classes are now an important feature in the programme of every political party, and the President of the Local Government Board recently said that the proper housing of the poor was the most important element of all in the social condition of the people. He correctly summed up the situation when he remarked that legisla tion was not at fault for the continuance of the present evils, but, the failure on the part of sanitary authorities to give effect to the sanitary enactments must be held accountable. Nevertheless, the Government contemplates next session the consolidation of all Acts dealing with the housing of the working classes into a single Act, in order to facilitate their application by local authorities; and the Local Government Board has quite recently issued circulars to the various sanitary authorities throughout the country, setting forth in a succinct manner their powers and duties in regard to these matters. The London County Council has the subject much at heart, and has appointed a committee to deal with the whole question. From their action, with the assistance of their medical officer of health, much good may be expected. Already the vestries appear to recognise that the time of slothfulness and inaction is rapidly passing away, and the reports to the County Council on insanitary areas in their districts, which some of these bodies have presented, are models of right feeling and good sense. At the East End of London, where the neglect of sanitation by vestries is most pronounced, private individuals and societies have recently beemk energetically engaged in prosecuting the owners of insanitary houses. They have every reason to be satisfied with their success, but until the law is so far amended that the exist ence of a nuisance injurious to health, when proved in a court of justice, becomes an offence puishable by a fine, we are afraid that house-farmers and small property owners will continue to endanger the lives of their tenants in order to line their own pockets. The splendid gift of a quarter of a million sterling by Sir Edward Guinness to be applied to providing clean and healthy homes for the poorest of the wage-earning classes in London and Dublin, fenced as it is by conditions which shall secure the money from being wasted in objectless charity, will no doubt prove the start ing-point for a clearance of those metropolitan rookeries, which have so long been allowed to disgrace the richest city of the world. Of provincial towns, Birmingham and Liverpool are active in meeting the requirements of their large and growing populations -Birmingham in erecting workmen's dwellings, and Liverpool in removing back-to-back houses and others which are dangerous to health. Manchester appears also to be now ready to attack the question of insanitary dwellings, on which its excessive death-rate so largely depends. In the JOURNAL of November 16th will be found the decision given in the important case of Walker v. Hobbs, in which it was laid down by the judges of appeal that Section 12 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1885 enabler tenant of a workmen's dwelling not only to leave the house, if found to be unfit for habitation, but to recover damages from the owner for any loss or injury he may have sustained by reason of the defective condition of the premises. Water Supplies.-The past year has seen no very substantial advance made to our knowledge of the conditions under which water is liable to absorb lead from pipes and cisterns. The absence of silica, the presence of free acid, the question of sus tained or intermittent pressure in the pipes, and the bacterio logical factor have all been discussed and appropriate remedies suggested, but with no indication that any generallv applicable law is capable of formulation on the subject. Cases of lead poisoning from drinking water have occurred at Bradford and its vicinity, and at Keighley Workhouse and Infirmary. We have also had occasion to notice in these columns the liability to con tamination with sewage of the Enfield water supply, from the ad mixture of subsoil water in the surface gravel with the pure water derived from chalk wells; and the very primitive arrange ments still in use at Perth for supplying the inhabitants of that city with a very incompletely filtered water taken from the sewage polluted river Tay have also been a matter of comment. The water supplied to London by its eight water companies has been of normal purity. The filtration and purification have been carefully performed, but so long as the bulk of the water is derived from the Thames and Lea after those rivers have received the sewage of numerous towns and villages on their banks, the supply, though ordinarily safe and good, cannot be regarded as an ideal one. Moreover, in a recent interesting report by Major-General Scott, the official water examiner, attention is seriously directed to the ever-increasing drain on the Thames to meet the requirements of the increasing population, and it is pointed out that ere long the problem of the whole water supply arising from the Thames basin must come prominently forward. Sewerage.-Mr. Baldwin Latham's scheme for sewering the town of Margate and carrying the sewage in a large outfall tunnel sewer to Foreness Point, where it is to be stored in a reservoir and discharged into the sea at suitable states of the tide, is now being put into execution. It is much to be regretted that it was not in this case found possible to purify the sewage before discharging it, as it 8o frequently happens that in the case of sewage discharge the easiest method i8 not in the end the cheapest or best that could be adopted. The city of Chichester, which for long has been in an indifferent sanitary condition, pro poses to carry out sewerage and sewage precipitation works. A new process for the chemical treatment of sewage, known as the " Amines " process, has been introduced during the course of the year. The essential element in this process is the addition of a small quantity of herring brine (methylamine) to the l-ime used as a precipitant. The herring brine acts as a deodorant and anti septic. During the year the new works of the Native Guano Company's (A B C) process have been ,opened at Kingston-on Thames. Vital Statisttce.-For the first three-quarters of the present year in England and Wales the birth-rate was 30.8 per 1,000, the death-rate 17.8 per 1,000, and the zymotic death-rate 2.21 per 1,000. In the twenty-eight large towns of the Registrar-General the birth-rate was 31.3 per 1,000, the death-rate 19.2 per 1,000, and the zymotic death-rate 2.97 per 1,000, whilst in London the birth-rate was 30.7 per 1,000, the death-rate 17.3 per 1,000, and the zymotic death-rate 2.4 per 1,000. In the first and becond</page><page sequence="38">1470 THE BRITISh MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28, 1889. ther than was apparent was sufficient to justify the condemnation of the carcasses. The decision is one that may well be the subject for congratulation, as if acted upon by local authorities generally, the grave danger of tuberculisation through diseased meat will be very completely warded off. It seems curious that with this decision, so clearly stated, nothing has hitherto been done to prevent the sale of milk from tuberculous cows, and yet the danger in this case is even more imminent and more pressing than it ever could be in the case of a food which is invariably cooked before being eaten. Evidence is continually accumulating as to the infective qualities of the milk from tuberculous cows, and yet nothing has yet been attempted to protect the population, and especially the younger members of it, from so grave a source of disease. All that is required, at first, is that tuberculosis and all udder eruptions should be included in the list of diseases of the cow as legally de fined in the Dairies and Cowsheds Order. Cases of meat poison ing have occurred during the course of the year at West Retford, where four families were rendered ill by eating pickled pork; at Cleator, where a number of young men were attacked with severe gastric symptoms after consuming beef sandwiches; at Aberdeen, where forty-eight persons were poisoned by stale fish roe; and at Carlisle and Oldham. In these cases there does not seem to have been any adequate investigation of the exact causes of the ill nesses; but, no doubt, as in previous cases of the kind, they may be attributed to bacterial agencies, or to the poisonous products of their activity in the meat or flesh whilst undergoing incomplete putrefaction. Water- Gas and Roburite.-Water-gas has been largely advocated this year as a cheap substitute for coal-gas in manufacturing and industrial pursuits. The great dangers attending the use of water gas are only beginning to be realised. Already there have been several fatal cases of poisoning by this gas in Yorkshire. The percentage of carbonic oxide in the gas is far larger than in coal-gas, varying as it does from 25 to 40 per cent., as against 5 or 6 in coal-gas; and besides water-gas is nearly or quite odourless, so that escapes from pipes are not readily perceived, and the victims are over powered by the poisonous carbonic oxide before they are aware that there is' any 'danger.' I Prom Baltimore in the Unitud States, where water-gas has been in considerable use for some years, it is reported that fifty-one deaths have occurred in that city since 1881 from this form of poisoning alone. Roburite is a new explosive which has been recently introduced into some Lancashire col lieries. It is a mixture of nitrobenzenes and ammonium nitrate, and it exerts its explosive force without the production of any flame such as might ignite coal dust or inflammable gases in the mine. Several cases of poisoning having occurred amongst the miners, either from handling the cartridges or from breathing the fumes after explosion, a Committee was appointed to inquire into the effect of roburite on the health of the workmen. From their report3 it appears that if stringent care is exercised the use of roburite will not add to the harmful conditions under which the miner works. Some of the unpleasant symptoms in the workmen appear to have been caused by absorption of the substance itself into the system, either by the skin or the lungs. In the blood the nitrobenzol is reduced, forming aniline, which' gives rise to cyanosis, dyspnoea, and syncope; but in cases of poisoning by the fumes after explosion, carbonic oxide appears to be the deleterious gas. LUNACY LEGISLATION. THE Lunacy Acts Amendment Bill of 1889, more fortunate than its four annual predecessors, was passed by the Houses of l'arliament during the year; but, except as regards a very small share of its provisions, the Act does not come into force until May, 1890. After the Bill had been introduced in the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor brought forward some amendments with regard to mechanical restraint in the treatment of the insane, which, had they passed into law, would lhave had at fettering effect upon the action of medical officers in charge of the insane such as would have been detrimental to the best interests of the patients in some of the most urgent and severe cises, and in some cases neither severe nor urgent. Largely in consequence of a leading article in this JOURNAL, and of recommendations by the Parliamentary Bills Committee, the Lord Chancellor vastly modified and improved the provisions as to mechanical means of restraint in his amendments, so that medical officers would not be hampered in the application of restraint in cases really reqluiring it. The original provision quarters Brighton had the lowest death-rates of any of the twenty-eight to ns (15.5 and 14.7 per 1,000), whilst in the third quarter Derby had the lowest rate (14.2 per 1,000). The highest death-rate in the first quarter was recorded by Blackburn (32.3 per 1,000), Manchester coming next with 28.5; in the second quarter Preston stood highest (32.6 per 1,000), Manchester again being second with 28; whilst in the third quarter Preston again is highest (33.0 per 1,000), and Newcastle-on-Tyne second with 27.6. The zymotic death-rates exhibit an extremely wide range in the different large towns, the lowest being in Halifax (first quarter, 0.79 per 1,000), in Norwich (second quarter, 0.85 per 1,000), and in Bristol (third quarter, 2.13 per 1,000), whilst the highest are in Blackburn (first quarter, 9.03 per 1,000), and Preston (second quarter, 10.09 per 1,000; third quarter, 12.75 per 1,000). Plymouth stands second in the third quarter with a mortality of 9,95 per 1,000, largely due to deaths from scarlet fever, which was epidemic at this season in the town. During the first quarter of the year measles was very prevalent, and caused a large number of deaths, the rate of mortality being 1.16 per 1,000 in the large towns, and 1.02 per 1,000 in London, In this quarter the death rate from whooping-cough was considerably below the average. In the second quarter measles shows a considerable decline, the death-rate being 0.82 per 1,000 in the large towns, and 0.62 per 1,000 in London. Whooping-cough was also below the average, whilst diarrhoea was rather in excess of the usual rate at this season, the death-rate in the twenty-eight towns being equal to 0.33 per 1,000. In the third quarter the measles death-rate fell below the mean rate in the corresponding periods of the seven preceding years. The death-rate from diarrhcea rose to 2.46 per 1,000 in the large towns, and to 1.8 per 1,000 in London. The rate ranged from 0.49 in Halifax to 4.94 in Leicester, and 7.36 in Preston. The " fever " death-rate (principally enteric fever) was much below the average, and was 0.22 per 1,000 in the large towns, and 0.15 per 1,000 in London. The highest rates were recorded in Salford, Leeds, and Preston. During the whole period under review scarlet fever mortality has been below the average, but as usual there has been an increasing prevalence of the disease in London during the autumn months. The number of scarlet fever patients in the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals, which had been 541 and 547 at the end of the first two quarters of the year, rapidly increased during the third quarter, and was 1,449 at the end of September. Diphtheria mortality still continues to be largely in excess of that recorded in previous years. This has been notably the case in London, where the deaths have been equal to an annual rate of 0.35 per 1,000, against a rate of 0.26 per 1,000 in the corresponding period of 1888, and of only 0.12 per 1,000 in the ten years 1871-80, which rate was then equal to that of the whole country. The death-rate from diphtheria for the first three-quarters of the present year in the twenty-eight towns was 0.25 per 1,000, against a rate of 0.18 per 1,000 in the corresponding period of last year. Small-pox only caused 20 deaths in England and Wales in the three-quarters, of which number 5 only occurred in the large towns. Only 3 cases of small-pox have been under treatment in the Metropolitan Asy lums Hospitals during this period, and these three cases were all admitted during the first three months of the year. There has been no death from small-pox in London. Diseased and Unsound Food.-The tuberculous meat question has been one of absorbing interest to health officers and the pro fession generally. The judicial inquiry at Glasgow is one of so much 'importance that we may be pardoned for summing up in this place its leading features. The inquiry was held with a view to decide whether the sanitary authorities can condemn a whole carcass, however sound it may appear, if indubitable evidence of tubercle, however much localised, is present The case was raised by the seizure by the sanitary inspector of the carcasses of a bul lock and a cow affected by tuberculosis. The chief question that came up for decision was whether the flesh of an animal suffering from tuberculosis could be consumed without risk to the con sumer, when the disease was apparently limited to the lungs, pleura, or ot,her organs, the diseased parts being removed. The inquiry lasted a number of days, and a variety of expert medical evidence was arrayed on both sides. The Sheriff's decision was to the effect that the carcass was unfit for food, and must be de stroyed, as he considered it proved in evidence that tuberculosis was transmissible from animals to man by ingestion: and that, although in the carcasses in question the tuberculosis was limited to the chest and the prepectoral lymphatic glands, and the flesh ap peared quite healthy, still the possibility of itshavingextended fur 3 JOURNAL, June 15th.</page><page sequence="39">Dec. 28, 1889.] THE BRITISH MEDCAL JOURNAL. 1471 was that mechanical means of bodily restraint shall not be applied to any lunatic unless a medical certificate shall have been pre viously signed describing the mechanical means to be used, and certifying that the restraint is necessary for purposes of surgical treatment, or to prevent the lunatic from injuring himself, and stating the grounds upon which the certificate is founded. This narrow limitation of cases to which mechanical restraint might be applied, and the provision that, no matter how desperate and urgent the case, a long certificate must be drawn up and signed before any restraint could be legally applied, were obviously provisions the general effects of which would have been prejudicial to the insane. In the form in which it was eventually passed, the provision is that mechanical means of restraint shall not be applied unless necessary for purposes of surgical or medical treatment, or to pre vent the lunatic from injuring himself or others; and that, as soon as it can be obtained, a medical certificate shall be signed, de scribing the mechanical means used, and the grounds upon which the certificate is founded. The provision in the Bill which dis criminated against medical men by limiting them to the reception, into their private houses, of three specified classes of "single patients," was finally removed from the Bill, and a provision was passed having a contrary effect, and permitting any person having charge of a "single patient" to receive, under special circum stances, more than one patient into his private and unlicensed house. P'reviously, not more than one person of unsound mind could be received under care in a house not licensed for the recep tion of lunatics. The provision as to letters written by private patients and not forwarded to their addresses was altered by omis sion of the direction that such letters should be forwarded to Commissioners in Lunacy or to Masters in Lunacy, an alteration vastly for the better, considering the rubbish many patients write in large amounts. The provision relating to the posting up of notices concerning the right of private patients to have all letters forwarded, and to have personal and private interviews with official visitors at every visit, was modified by making the posting up of such notices dependent upon a direction by the Commis sioners in Lunacy. It was also promised verbally that the special reports and certificates from the medical officers of asylums relating to insane patients detained therein, and required as a prerequisite to renewal by the Commissioners of the reception orders relating to such patients, should be in such form as that the making of them should not occupy so much time, or necessitate so much work, as to interfere unduly with the performance of the ordinary duties of these medical officers. Several new features were also introduced into the Bill, as, for example, that concern ing the power to recover expenses of his maintenance, etc., against the estate of a lunatic chargeable to any union, county, or borough:-that which enacts that a judge of County Courts and magistrate shall not be required to exercise any powers under this Act so as to interfere with or delay the exercise of his ordinary jurisdiction; and that which enables a public department to apply the pension, pay, superannuation, or other allowance or annuity of a lunatic, under the control or management of the de partment, to the maintenance of the lunatic, and of those depen dent upon him. Many of the alterations made in the Bill during its passage through the Houses of Parliament were in accordance with suggestions urged by the Parliamentary Bills Committee, and by the members of Parliament who supported that Committee's recommendation. N-AVAL AND MILITARY MEDICAL SERVICE. NAVAL MEDICAL SERVICE. Again, it may be said, as in the retrospect of the previous year, that in the naval there is little to chronicle compared with the Army MIedical Service. This should properly be a subject of con gratulation, for the land service would gladly have less of con tentirus-history to record. Although coupled with the army in the scope of Lord Camperdown's Commission, the naval service evidently did not occupy much of its deliberations, and, fortu nately, has little space devoted to it in the Report. It had, indeed, no crying grievances to ventilate like its sister service. The Report in noting considerable reductions in the establishment during recent years, significantly adds, that in the dockyards such reductions had been carried to the limit of safety and efficiency; the process of paring to the quick will therefore probably now cease. This is good news, for the senior medical officers had real cause to say the continued reductions of these shore appointments was a serious blow to them after many years of sea service, mostly in foreign parts. But the reduction in the number of shore appointments was coupled with a shortening of the period of tenure of them-a double blow. This was strongly objected to by many officers, but has been defended by some on the ground that it gives a larger number a better chance of occupying them in turn. In the Naval Medical Service there has been no agitation on the subject of rank and titles; it was therefore the less excusable for the *three dissentients " in the Camperdown Report to drag in the question of naval titles, as a sort of " red herring," across the pressing reform of army rank and titles. It was a manceuvre promptly seen through and exposed. During the year an important order was issued regulating the admission of surgeons for temporary service in the navy. It was feared it would give offence to the regular medical officers, but such does not seem to have been the case, and it was announced some time ago that upwards of 200 surgeons had joined this species of naval medical reserve. Death, as usual, has claimed a certain number of victims, but the obituary is not a heavy one. Among well known and dis tinguished old officers on the retired list there have died during the year Inspector-General Peter Leonard, Fleet-Surgeons Cunningham, Little, Clarke, Duncan, Crawford, Mockridge and Nelson; Staff Surgeons Osman, Preston and Evans; and Surgeon J. G. Lyell. On the active list the names of Surgeons Julyan, McDonnell and Vasey have been recorded. THE ARMY MEDICAL STAFF. Lord Cctmperdown's Committee.-The Army Medical Service has passed through another year of agitation and controversy, with which we have endeavoured to keep our readers fully informed in these columns. Although the War Minister has not yet disclosed his plans as the outcome of the controversy, he cannot now delay on the plea of want of information, and, we hope, no longer considers the grievances of medical officers as "mainly senti mental." The delay in settlement, although trying to the patience of medical officers, has had its compensations in permitting the vital questions of rank, station, titles and retirement to be nar rowed and consolidated into definite issues. This has chiefly been brought about through the report of Lord Camperdown's Com mittee, of which, in a series of articles, we have endeavoured to place an analysis in a non-partisan spirit before our readers. The recommendations of that Commission, whether viewed as good, bad, or indifferent, have at least had the merit of evoking from writers and correspondents clearer and more definite expressions of opinion. Keen disappointment has been felt and expressed by a large number, especially of the younger medical officers, that the Committee did not boldly advise the consolidation of the medical department into an autonomous Royal Corps, in which the officers should have substantive rank and military titles. That such must and will be the ultimate settlement ef the diffi culty there seems not the smallest doubt, as has been the result in the medical department of the French army, after years of tenta tive and unsaatisfactory shuffling with the Intendance Service. But our older officers, more experienced in the ways of our military authorities, never expected radical or final recommenda tions from the Committee constituted as it was; indeed, it is no secret that, but for the ability and persistence of Mr. iMacnamara, as an independent representative of the profession, its representa tions and recommendations would have been less favourable than they are. The important points in the report may be summarised as follows:-The Committee allow that the abolition of relative rank enabled medical officers to affirm with a logical correctness there is no " sentiment " in pure logic-that they have no rank at all; the suggestion of consecutive compound titles is an admission that medical officers should have clear military titles; the explicit condemnation of increase of tours of foreign service is a recog nition of the fact that the wear and tear of service, already too great, cannot be safely added to; they report the rates of pay fixed in 1879 to be adequate, but no more than necessary; they decline to recommend, what would be a clear breach of faith, any interference with the existing right of retirement; they condemn the injustice of not making Royal Warrants run in India, where so many medical officers are constantly quartered. We consider the above findings to be not only in the right direction, but most impor tant in strengthening the general position oL the medical officers, and in clearing away misconceptions, and tending to enlighten all from the War Minister downward. We quote from the boly of the report in which the recommendations are brought prominently</page><page sequence="40">1472 TIHB BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. lDec. 28,1889. into relief by the curious "1 dissents " appended. Of these we will only say, that if conditions of service and retirement are treated in the high-handed way suggested, not only will gross injustice be done, but a shock given to public confidence and morality. The proposal to deprive medical officers of their present limited but absolutely necessary command, we can only characterise as out rageously retrograde. It is easy to see its object, which is to accentuate the class and caste position of medical officers, and keep them outside army organisation. But the tendency of enlightened administration and organisation is the very reverse; it aims at fixing them more definitely as integral portions of the military machine, and conferring such full power as is essential for the efficient performance of duty. The French War Minister has just given Mr. Stanhope a lead in this matter which we very strongly advise him to study and follow irrespective of military pre judices. Army Medical Reserve.-This reserve-made up of medical officers already part and parcel of the auxiliary forces-has not attracted much attention during the year. From what we can learn it has probably attained its full dimensions, and is more likely to contract than expand, in view of the feeling that a more thorough organisation of the volunteer medical service is much needed in its own proper sphere. Director General.-Surgeon-General W. A. Mackinnon, C.B., succeeded Sir Thomas Crawford, K.C.B., in the Director-Generalship. In the reign of the latter, which was by no means a bed of roses, much was done in consolidating the regulations and perfecting hospital equipment; and we are very pleased to hear that the latter is now in a state of preparedness for mobilisation second to no other branch of the army. Sir Thomas Crawford had many amiable qLitlities, but it would have been better for his departmental popularity had he sooner recognised the importance of the rank question, and listened less to counsels suspected of civilianising his department. We trust the new Director General will make the roster an open document, and do his best to dispel the air of mystery in the working of his office. Honours anzd Rewards.-While such are, as a rule, but too sparingly dispensed to medical officers, we note with pride that two of their number have during the year received the highest decoration of all-the Victoria Cross-namely, Surgeon Crimmin of the Indian Medical Service, and Surgeon Le Quesne of the Medical Staff. Both of these officers have been decorated for heroic conduct under fire in the field in Burmah. As the veriest fire eating fighters can do no more than risk their lives as these officers did, surely, for very shame, we shall hear no more of the talk at once untruthful, ungenerous, and unmanly, of doctors being non combatants! Obituary.-The mortality both on the active and retired lists has been moderate; nevertheless some well-known, loved, and respected names have disappeared. Among these have been such widely known men as Surgeon-General E. J. Franklyn, and Deputy Surgeons-General H. B. Franklyn, D. Boyes Smith, M. Combe and J. Fraser, Inspector-General F. C. Annesley, and Deputy Inspectors C. R. Boyes, J. J. Clifford and George Anderson; the latter was one of the fathers of the department, and a fine specimen of the gentleman of the old school; also Brigade-Surgeons L. A. White, F. A. Turton, J. D' Altera, and J. Barker, Surgeon Magins, J. C. Haverty, R. Keith, R. W. O'Donnell, J. A. Smith, and T. Faris. The death of Keith, who was in personal attendance on the Duke of Connaught, was very deeply regretted by a wide circle of friends. In T. Faris, the department lost one of its ablest officers, who at the time of his lamented death was Staff-Officer of the Medical Staff Corps at head-quarters; he was the inventor of the stretcher which bears his name, and to his many accomplishments was a barrister at-law, as was also H. B. Franklyn. The deaths were also recorded of promising young officers-Surgeons C. Hayden, J. Bulfin, H. E. B. Flanagan, and G. S. Tate. The rapidly diminishing remnant of assistant-surgeons was lessened by the deaths of G.-D. Milne, and A. H. Lynch. THE INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE. THE most important event in this service during the past year has been the retirement of Sir James Simpson from the head of the medical department of Bengal. Sir James Simpson was deservedly popular with his brother officers for his courteous and just adminis tration. Some feeling has been excited in the service by the appointment of his successor, who superseded two medical officers whose claims to promotiohi were generally acknowledged by the service to be worthy of more consideration, more particularly on ground of military service, Sir James Simpson's successor's service having been entirely civil. The government of India is intent on economy, and the medical service has been disturbed by rumours of furtherreductionsinitshighergrades. We hopethesedisquieting rumours have no foundation, in fact there would be little wisdom in any measure of this kind; to reduce the number of the few prizes open to the medical service of the state would be disastrous to its well-being, and would be false economy in the real meaning of the term. Economy at the cost of efficiency carries failure on the face of it. It is with great regret that we learn that the local government of India is still seeking economy at the expense of efficiency, in urging the Secretary of State for India to withdraw the young medical officers from the Netley school. It has been demonstrated, over and over again, that the proposal to give the needful practical instruction for military medical service in India to surgeons on probation for the three Presidencies, would, far from being a saving, cost much more money than the present system. It has been shown that the professors in the medical colleges of the three Presidencies have their hands full, and cannot, under the trying conditions of climate, undertake this heavy addition to their already sufficiently onerous duties. The advisers of the government of India seem ignorant of another fact. The Army Medical School has been in existence since the year 1860, and has, in this long course of time, accumulated a costly teaching plant and a library for the use of the surgeons on probation, complete in every branch of medical literature, "ancient and modern." Is the government of India prepared, on the score of "$economy," to eupply a like teaching plant for the three Presi dencies for the use of its young medical officers on probation? This question has now been thoroughly threshed out on both sides, and the final decision rests with the Secretary of State for India, We sincerely trust he may be guided in this important matter to a wise judgment. MEDICAL EVENTS OF THE YEAR TI SCOTLAND. EDINBURGH. The Universities (Scotland) Act.-The University of Edinburgh. The Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons.-The Edinburgh Medical School.-Public tealth.-Lunacy.-Burial Reform. Sick Nursing.- The Societies. The Universities (Scotland) Act.-The passing of the Universities Act, after many futile attempts, is perhaps the most important event of the year. The measure indicates not merely a further elaboration of presently existing arrangements. Its scope is extremely wide, and includes, so far as the subject of medicine at Edinburgh is concerned, the whole question of medical education. The length and arrangement of the curriculum, the relation of sys tematic to practical and clinical instruction, the sub-division of advancing and developing branches of science, the number and remuneration of professors, of assistant professors and assistants, the method of conducting professional examinations, the desira bility of increased facilities in respect of extra-mural classes, the relation of the University to the medical education of women these and many other important topics, will all form the subject of a close review. We look for a large solution of many pressing problems, and this can only be expected as the result of the utmost patience, fairness, and disinterested action on the part of the gentlemen, to whom has been entrusted the responsible office of adjudication and recommendation. Thecountry is to be congratu lated on having found so suitable a bench in the persons of the fifteen noblemen and gentlemen who have been selected as com missioners. Their labours will commence more formally in January, and will be watched with keenest interest by all parties. The passing of the Act has already necessitated certain important changes. Notably, it has transferred from the Senatus Academicus to the enlarged University Court the necessarily anxious cares involved in the adminstration of the property and finances of the University, with which, we have always held, the University pro fessors were unnecessarily and unsuitably burdened. The increase in the size of the University Court is due to an increase of three representatives each, respectively from the Senatus Academicus and the General Council. The names thus adled are:-Professors Crum Brown, Taylor, and Sir William Turner, from the University and Dr. John Duncan, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, the Right Honourable the Lord Justice Clerk, and Mr. T. M'Kie, Advocate, from the General Council. The Commissioners have,</page><page sequence="41">Dec. 28, 1889.] THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. 1473 meanwhile requested all the interested bodies to prepare state ments of the kind of evidence they desire to lead. University of Edinburgh.-We have had to report a continuance of the remarkable development of the largest medical school in the kingdom. The number of matriculated students in medicine promises to be larger this year than previously. As pointed out by our correspondent some weeks ago, however, this apparent numerical increase has been manifestly accentuated by the growing tendency at Edinburgh-a tendency in the right direction-to devote five years in place of four to the necessary study for the degree. In the medical professoriate, no change has occurred, though the school has had to lament the removal of Professor Muirhead, who, while belonging to the faculty of law, took the broadest and deepest interest in all that affected the general good of the University. In the ranks of the assistantship more than one change has occurred. Dr. Howden has been called from the department of anatomy to the lectureship in anatomy at New castle, and Drs. R. W. Philip and Ralph Stockman have become lecturers in the extra-mural school, in practice of physic and materia medica, respectively. The University Council meetings have, on the whole, been more lively, though there is much need for improvement. The question of publicity in professional examinations was raised by Dr. Alexander James, and a resolution recommending the granting of leave to University graduates to attend was adopted. The Council also dealt with the qualification of University graduates in respect of the honorary physiciansbips and surgeoncies to the public charities. Communications were received from the managers of most of those, including the Royal Infirmary, to the effect that, after full consideration they preferred to leave the matter in statu quo. This, therefore, continues the ultimate patronage in the hands of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons. The University still continues to dispense its fair quota of medical diplomas. At the annual graduation in August, the degree of M.D. was conferred on fifty-nine gentlemen, and the degree of M.B.,C.M. on 164, while a special graduation was held recently, when some twenty gentlemen who had been referred on one special branch for three months, received the University's qualification to practise. The Students' Representative Council has maintained its high character for activity and resolution in respect of academic discipline, and there is reason to believe that its estab lishment has been a most wise step on the part of the University authorities who encouraged it. The students continue to crave alterations in the curriculum, and having achieved a modification of the conditions of the first examination, they have been urgent in the request that it should be permissible for them to present themselves for the first division of the second (anatomy and physiology), at the end of the second year. This proposal, if not initiated by, has the support of the majority in the medical faculty of the University-and it has been approved by the University of Aberdeen-but the Edinburgh University Court has delayed the matter for further consideration. This winter session, the students of Edinburgh have had the enormous boon granted them of using the now completed Union buildings. The success of the under taking has been determined. Indeed, the only fear is that the membership may increase out of proportion to the possibilities of the building. The farther work in connection with the new buildings goes on apace, and already the outline of the great academic hall begins to rear itself over the lofty palisading which shuts off the work from the public view. The new year should see the erection of the Academic HIall completed The various special lectureships have been thoroughly appreciated, and Mr. Romanes and Dr. Hutchinson Stirling have both had good audiences. This year, there was inaugurated a movement, called the Edinburgh University Gathering, having for its object the bringing of the educational advantages afforded by University extension lectures more directly before the people. Several of the scientific and medical staff contributed lectures. There is still need for a greater stirring up of the love of research in the University laboratories. Much depends, doubtless, on the inspiTation of the official head of the laboratory, and if this be lacking, nothing else can supply the place. On the other hand, the foundation of fellowships for the endowment of research will help much, and the asssociation with this in view, is urgent in its demands for further help. The last contribution has come from Dr. A. H. Barbour, whose own researches have done something for the reputation of Edinburgh, and who has instituted a scholarship of ?50 per annum. The Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons.-This year has brought a change in the presidentship of both colleges. Dr. Peel Ritchie, latePresident of the Royal College of Physicians, has been succeeded by Dr. Grainger Stewart, and Dr. Joseph Bell, late President of the Royal College of Surgeons, by Dr. John Duncan. The Research Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians has contributed excellent work during the past year, and the first volume of reports has received high encomiums in most influential quarters. A second volume is in course of arrangement, and is expected to prove a thoroughly worthy successor. The Royal College of Physicians, we are in formed, has invited the Physiological Society to hold their annual meeting in Edinburgh, and have placed their rooms and labora tory at their disposal, an invitation which the physiologists have cordially accepted. The means of encouraging research at the disposal of the College of Physicians have beenfurther increased by the institution of a scholarship of the value of ?100 per annum, to be competed for biennially. The donor is Dr. A. H. Barbour. The establishment of the laboratory was celebrated by a conver sazione in the Royal College of Physicians, which, under the ex cellent presidency of Dr. Peel Ritchie, proved an admirable success. The Edinburgh Medical School.-The Edinburgh Medical School maintains its unique position as an adjunct source of great strength to the teaching of medicine at Edinburgh. A number of new lecturers have been added to the list; Dr. Stockman, in materia medica; Drs. G. A. Gibson and R. W. Philip, in practice of physic; Dr. Mathieson, in midwifery, etc. The system of special classes has been further elaborated, and there is evidence of undoubted appreciation on the part of young graduates and senior students. The dream of last year is coming more near fulfilment, and men have begun to recognise that, in certain'de partments at least, Edinburgh is prepared to offer advantages equal to those afforded by the great continental centres. Already the foundations have been laid of what may fairly be expected to develop into a powerful post-graduate school. The autumn course of post-graduate instruction was well attended by graduates from all parts of the world. A new prize has been instituted in materia medica and therapeutics, called the Bathgate Memorial Prize, in memory of the late Dr. Bathgate. Things have not gone quite smoothly in the ladies' camp. In an action at the instance of two late members of the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, against the executive of the school, Lord Kyllachy, pronounced a judgment adverse to the latter, finding them liable to each of the pursuers in a sum of ?50, along with costs. In pronouncing judg ment, the Lord Ordinary condemned the system of government which had been allowed to prevail in the school as unnecessarily harsh and stringent. Public interest has been awakened afresh on the whole question of the medical education of women, and it has been resolved to establish a Scottish Association for the Medi cal Education of Women, which shall take cognisance of every department of this important subject and, more particularly, wiTl arrange for the establishmenAt of classes, on a basis similar to that of the already existing school for male students to be open to all. For the present winter, temporary arrangements have been made with several teachers, with whom the lady students-fifteen in number-have heartily co-operated. The a?sociation has received influential support, professional and lay. The managers of the Royal Infirmary have still further increased the staff of assistant surgeons, so that the surgical side of the hospital is well equipped. The medical half of the hospital seems less sufficiently manned. Dr. Keiller, after many years of service at the Royal Maternity Hospital, has resigned, and the vacancy thus created has been filled by the election of Dr. Berry Hart. Public Health.-The awakened interest in questions of hygiene, which was noted last year, has been maintained. The subjects of improved sanitation and plumber work have been abundantly discussed. The vital questions affecting the condition of the poor have not been overlooked. In the Social and Sanitary Asso ciations there exist two agencies largely occupied with an attempt to ameliorate the condition of the poor. The weekly public health lectures, which it was feared might have to be given up for want of funds, have been continued this winter, and appreciative audiences have filled the lecture hall. The benefi cent institution of halfpenny dinners for poor children has been reinaugurated this winter. The attention of the authorities has been drawn to the culpable selling of methylated spirit to poor persons, notoriously for consumption, and stringent regulations have been adopted with a view to the prevention of this crying evil. A suggestion was offered to the Town Council that an attempt should be made to supply Edinburgh with salt water, more particularly for bathing and for watering and cleaning</page><page sequence="42">1474 THE BRITISR MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28, 18E9. purposes. The matter was referred for further inquiry; but as yet no practical issue has resulted. The idea is one, however, that should not be lost sight of. The epidemics of sore throat and scarlatina, which, in 1888, were clearly traced to contaminated milk supply,-roused public attention, and a more thorough in spection of the cowhouses and dairies of the city and neighbour hood was called for, with the result that a large proportion of these were found to fall short of statutory requirements. The immediate effect has been to ensure more rigid surveillance in this very important department, and ultimately a large reform may be expected. The subject of pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has occupied the attention of our veterinary societies, and several members of the medical profession-notably Professors Chiene and Hamilton-have offered their co-operation in the carrying out of investigations on the subject. Lunaey.-Gratifying reports have been issued by the commis sioners on the state of the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. The managers and the enthusiastic physician superintendent are to be congratulated on having this year received the plans and estimates for the erection of a magnificently arranged new building. It is much to be regretted that the Edinburgh medical students do not take fuller advantage of the unusually good clinical advantages afforded by this institution. Unhappily, many graduates learn too late what an important part of medical trainina they have omitted; and nowhere are better opportunities offered than at the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. Burial Reformn.-At a meeting held under the presidency of the President of the Royal College of Physicians strong resolutions were adopted, condemning the unnecessary display and expendi ture in connection with the disposal of the dead. An association, to be named the Burial, Mourning, and Funeral Reform Society of Edinburgh, was formed, with the object of disseminating more rational views on the subject. Skck Nur8ing.-The nursing of the sick poor has always been looked on with much interest in Edinburgh, and for years we have had the services, both administrative and working, of devoted ladies in this special field. The names of Miss Ann Maitland, Miss Cowan, Mrs, Chiene, Miss Ferguson, and others occupy an honourable place on the list. More recently the work has received fresh impetus through the foundation of the Scottish Branch of the QLueen Victoria Nurses' Institute, under the energetic presidency of the Counte?s of Rosebery. The branch has already done much excellent work, and most effi ciently supplebiented the labours of the earlier workers. From the large amount of general interest which the more conspicuous movement ha0 awakened a career of much usefulness may be expected. The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh has signified its approval by subsidising the branch through a dona tion of ?250. The Societies.-The medical and scientific societies have been most active. Oat correspondent has noted increased evidence of vitality over past years. The Medico-Chirurgical has, during the year, had several discussions of importance, notably that on pro posed legislation with regard to habitual drunkenness, in which the Society had the co-operation of their brethren in the legal faculty, and that on intestinal obstruction, in which both physi cians and surgeons took active part. The reports of the meetings have been recorded in the JOURNAL from month to month, and present a list of papers, rare cases, therapeutic advances, patho logical specimens, and discussions of much value. The Obstetrical Society celebrated its jubilee this year under the presidency of Dr. Underhill. Its transactions, too, form an important contribu tion to this department of medicine. The Royal Society still progresses in the development of the biological side, and this year the Proceedings contain several-papers of medical interest. Thus papers were communicated by Professor T. R. Fraser on the natural history and pharmacology of strophanthus hispidus, by Dr. Alex. Bruce on the corpus callosum, by Drs. Paton and Stock man on metabolism of man during starvation, by Dr. Ashdown on certain substances, found in the urine, which reduce the oxide of copper upon boiling in the presence of an alkali, bV Dr. James on some points connected with clonus, by Dr. Haycraft en the chromatology of bile, etc. The Pathological Club still maintains its excellent reputation, but as the meetings are private and no trinsactions furnished, fuller details of its work are impossible. There is always a keen competition for vacant places in its mem bership, which is limited to thirty. The Scottish Microscopical S6ciety has started well; -it has selected Professor Sir William Turner as first president. GLASGOW. The University.-Extension of University Teaching and Post graduate Courses.-The Extra-mural Schools of Medicine. Queen Margaret College.-Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons. -Public Health and Social Problems.-Tuberculous Meat. Dwellings of the Poor.-Population.- The Infirmnaries.-Lunacy in Scotland. The Uni'versity.-During the year which is closing there has been a truce to the strife of intra-university political parties. It was clear that university reform could no longer be delayed; and if there were any within the University who objected to reform altogether, they were wise enough to perceive the inevitable, and prudent enough to make the best of it. So at the last all parties endeavoured to make the best of the oft-introduced Universities' Bill, and combined to secure the settlement of a subject already too long delayed. Thus on August 30th the Bill passed into law and comes into force on January 1st next. But over the question of the election of three additional assessors to the University Court from the Council the truce has been broken. The University Council Association, somewhat engrossed, perhaps, in congratu lating themselves on the success of their efforts to improve the Bill by enlarging the Court and increasing their powers at the expense of the Senate, were anticipated in nominations for the asaessorships by a committee rapidly formed to secure the elec tion of three gentlemen who, though pledged to reform, had taken no active part in the strife, and were not, at any rate, personce ingrate to the University authorities. Before even the Council Association had nominated their candidates, this committee had secured pledges sufficient to warrant their formation and almost to promise them victory. An attempt at a compromise, made at the last moment, failed; and at the General Council meeting, held in November, six candidates were nominated: Dr. Hector C. Cameron, the well-known surgeon and extra-mural teacher, and the representative of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons on the General Medical Council, Sir John Neilson Cuthbertson, chairman of the Glasgow School Board, and Mr. David Hannay, who for seventeen years was clerk to the University Council, on behalf of the committee already mentioned; and Sheriff Guthrie, of Glasgow, Mr. Vary Campbell, Advocate, and Dr. D. C. McVail,on behalf of the Council Association. Th-e vote taken at the meeting showed nearly two to one in favour of the first three gentlemen, and that result was subsequently confirmed by a poll by voting papers of the entire constituency. One important fact brought out by the contest was that, if any anti-reform party ever existed, it now no longer exists. All the candidates were pledged to re form in the direction of the institution of entrance examinations, the rearrangement of studies by the introduction of optional courses in arts and science degree subjects, the affiliation of new colleges, the widening of examining boards, and the fuller exten sion of university teaching by an increase of the teaching staff and in other ways. The difference in parties may now be indi cated by saying that one advocates reform from within, maintain ing the characteristic features'of the Scottish university system; and the other seeks reform from without, by adding on to the uni versity new colleges-in fact, breaking down distinctions between intra- and extra-mural classes. Meanwhile all parties are busily preparing for the Commission; and there is no manner of doubt that the commissioners will not want for evidence, nor for pro posals, nor for schemes of far-reaching reform. The University assistants have lately entered the field, and are already occupied preparing a careful statement regarding their status and duties in the University, and will be ready with a well-considered series of proposals for remedying the altogether anomalous and unsatisfac tory position they at present occupy in the constitution of the University. No changes in the University staff have occurred this year on the medical side, but on the arts side changes have occurred, owing to the resignation of three of the best known and most eminent professors: Professor Nichol, of the English litera ture chair, Professor Jebb, of the Greek chair, transferred to Cam bridge, and Professor James Thomson, of civil engineering; and now Professor Bradley, Professor Murray, and Professor Barr reign in their stead. An addition to the staff has been made by the be quest of ?2,500 left to the University by a citizen of Glasgow, Mr. Wm. Baxter, for the founding of a demonstratorship in geo logy. The first occupant of the office is Mr. B. G. Cormack. The attendance of students, though in the medical and arts facul ties very slightly less than last year, owing doubtless to the con</page><page sequence="43">Dec, 28, 1889.] THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. 1475 tinued prosperity of trade, still maintains the high average of recent years. The total number of matriculated students is 2,041, and of these 683 are medical, 11 fewer than last year. Among the medical students avigorous effort is being made to establish a volun teer medical staff corps, similar to those already in existence in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The effort was begun last year, but it is expected to be this session crowned with success by Govern ment recognition. The surgeon-commandant is Dr. George T. Beatson, and among the students the leader in the movement is Professor McKendrick's son, Mr. W. J. MIcKendrick. There is a movement of another character, common to all the stu dents, which, if successful, is likely to lead to the desirable result of establishing among them a social bond, so characteristically lacking in the Scottisih universities. It is one for providing on a permanently satisfactory footing a Students' Union. The buildings for the purpose have been already provided by the generosity of an old medical student, Dr. J. McIntyre (JTants), but little advan tage can be taken of them till a sum is raised for their maintenance, the sum required being ?10,000. To raise this a grand bazaar was held a few days ago, attended by most remarkable success, the sum aimed at beingmuch more than realised. With the complete estab lishment of the union, aided by the energetic but prudent action of the Students' Representative Council (at present prudence seems to regulate the proceedings of that body, and, quoad ultra, only masterly inactivity), there ought to be aroused among the body of students some community of life and sentiment, some re alisation, as regards the university, of a feeling of citizenship, some esprit de corps, of all which, meantime, there is little or none. In fact, the body of students attending a Scottish university answers very well to the description given by someone of a well-known nostrum, " a heterogeneous combination of irreconcilable ele ments." The EL tension of Unsiversity Teaching and Post-Graduate Courses have not prospered in Glasgow, and the latter have prac cally ceased to be. In our last year's review it was suggested that the subjects which were selected with which to make the experi ment of evening classes in the University were too limited, and not wisely chosen. This opinion has been confirmed b-y their failure, and that experiment has been meanwhile closed. With out the University, in the city, and in surrounding towns extension classes have met with meagre success, if success it can be called. Some classes, notably those of English literature, have prospered, aud this session courses of lectures on physiology, delivered by Professor McKendrick in Pollokshields and Paisley, have been well attended; but, taking the scheme all in all, failure is written across it. Whether apathy of the public mind in the matter of university culture is to blame for this or bad management of the Extension Board, is a question that would bear discussion, and might not be decided altogether in favour of the Board. The Extra-mnural 8chools of Medicine are passing through a critical stage in their history. The Royal Infirmary Medical School has ceased to exist as such, having been incorporated in the newly-founded St. Mungo's College, incorporated as a limited company by licence from the Board of Trade. The establishment of this College was achieved chiefly by the action of the managers of the Royal Infirmary, guided by Dr. McVail. It was done in pursuance of the effort of the managers to attract more students to the Infirmary MIedical School in the interests of the efficient working of the Infirmary. But all efforts proved unavailing, chiefly, in the managers' opinion, because only four courses were permitted to count for the University degree. The affiliation of the School to the University, as it stood, seemed unlikely to be realised, while every chance of success seemed to be with a col lege duly incorporated and endowed. Students would probably be attracted to such a college, related to the infirmary, since they would then be on an equal footing with university students. The incorporation has been obtained, powers being also secured to extend the teaching to all the arts and seiences. The whole scheme of the new college, with fully developed proposals for the teaching of arts, science, law, and medicine on a more complate scale than is found in any Scottish university, is excellently set forth in the scholarly address with which thbe Principal, Dr. Blackie, opened the new college. Meantime teaching facilities in medicine and law only are provided, and an effort is being made to raise an endowment. The next step is the securing of affilia tion, without which there is no prospect of any more medical students being drawn to the classes than attended them when under the designation of the Royal Infirmary Medical School, and it would be unfair to judge of the probable future of the college from the present number of students. The prospects of affiliation have, however, been gravely compromised by the unwise, and, in the opinion of some people, improper method of ap pointing to the various chairs and lectureships in the college. Some time after the appointment of governors to the new college and their committees, and without any previous intimation that appointments were about to be made, announcement was made in one of the daily papers that all the medical and law chairs had been filled, the names of the favoured individuals being given. In the case of the medical faculty the professors were those who had been lecturers in the Royal Infirmary Medical School, but this rule had its exceptions, and not one of those appointed to the faculty of law had held previously any similar appointment. This wholesale manufacture of professors surprised and amused the public of Glasgow, and it remains to be seen whether it will not seriously affect the question of alliliation so far as St. Mungo's College is concerned.-The Anderson's College Medical School opened the session in their new buildings, in close proximity to the University and Western Infirmary, scarcely yet completed; and, with capacity and energy on the part of the teachers, a new era of prosperity may await them. The vacancy in the chair of chemistry, due to Professor Dittmar remaining with that part of Anderson's College which became amalga mated with the Technical College, was filled by the appoint ment of Mr. J. Robertscn Watson, AI.A; and to the chair of midwifery, vacant by the resignation of Dr. Abram Wallace, removed to London, Dr. W. L. Reid was appointed.-The small Western Medical School has terminated a brief existence, the men whose abilities alone secured for it a brief term of life having joined the staff of St. Mungo's College or that of Anderson's Col lege, one of the early breaks being made by the death of the teacher of anatomy, Mr. Carter. Queen MIarqaret College continues its work of extending a uni versity education to women. The resources of the College have been much increased by the building of two laboratories, one of which is devoted to physical and microscopical purposes, while the other has been fitted up in a very thorough fashion as a che mical labcratory. The numbers in attendance, however, do not increase as might have been expected. The scientific subjects taught this year are physics and chemistry. A proposal is being revolved by those responsible for the management for adding to the functions of the College that of providing a complete medical education for women, but no serious steps have yet been taken in that direction. Faculty of Physicians and Surqeons-At the annual meeting Dr. Perry was elected President, and Dr. Yellowlees Vice-Press dent; the representative to the General Medical Council is still Dr. Hector C. Cameron. Piublic Health.- During the year 1888 there was recorded the lowest death-rate for the city of Glasgow since registra tion began. For that year it was 22 per 1,000 per annum; for the year previous it was 23; and there bas been a gradual decline since 1883, when it was 27. Some of the reasons assigned were the absence of any severe epidemic, especially of the infec tious diseases of children, a cold summer, safeguarding from the fatal diarrhoea of infants, and a warm winter, implying a diminu tion of pulmonary disease. The report for 1889 is not, of course, yet complete; but several circumstances indicata there will not this year be such a combination of favourable circumstances. At the close of last year an epidemic of scarlet fever occurred in the western outskirts of Glasgow. That, of course, does not affect the Glasgow rate, having occurred beyond the boundaries. The dis trict affected was at the junction of three districts-Hillhead, Dowanhill, and Partick-under different local authorities, and as a natural consequence there were delays and difficulties in the way of any systematic effort being made to cope with it. There were strong grounds for believing the infection to be spread by milk from one dairy, and some forty cases in all occurred, The beginning of the year saw a growing epidemic of measles, which continued to spread with great rapidity till it involved every dis trict of the city. As it spread to the poorer districts the mortality rose, till in one fortnight (in AMarch) 707 cases were registered, and seventy-two deaths. During the same period whooping cough was widely prevalent, the deaths from this cause following hard after these due to measles, and subsequently exceeding them. With the advent of summer diarrhceal diseases of children caused a renewed increase of the death-rate, so that as early as August Dr. Russell was constrained to declare that the present year would be remarkable for its high infant mortality'</page><page sequence="44">1476 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28. 1989. In the later months of the year, scarlet fever, though not occuring in outbursts, has prevailed more extensively than the registered cases indicate, and there are indications of a higher death-rate from pulmonary disease than characterised last year. On the whole there is no doubt Dr. Russell's gradual but uninterrupted decline of mortality for six years will this year be replaced by a considerable increase. Many towns in the West of Scotland, Johnstone, Greenock, Paisley, etc., were visited by similar out breaks. In January the first case of small-pox registered in Glas gow since April, 1888, occurred in the person of a seamen, but it was promptly suppressed. It was introduced into Dundee in December last year, also by a seaman from a Mediterranean port; eleven cases occurred, of whom four died. In the same town, in April, a renewed outbreak occurred, three cases occurring in children in the same family. The Glasgow authorities have adopted the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act. Tuberculous Meat.-Early in the year the public mind was much agitated by a series of articles appearing in the Glasgow Herald, with reference to the sale of diseased, and especially tuberculous, meat. As the result, the sanitary authorities raised a test case by seizing two diseased carcasses, and claiming the right of wholly destroying them. The owners resisted, and a judicial inquiry was held, presided over by the sheriff of the county, Sheriff Berry. After a long and most careful inquiry, to the aid of which a large amount of expert evidence was forthcoming, the sheriff found the sanitary authorities entitled to confiscate the whole of a carcass in which evidence of tubercular disease was found, however localised. Subsequently the sanitary authority took steps to place the business of meat inspection on a thorough basis, and, by arrangement with the cattle salesmen, condemned carcasses are now to be immersed in a solution of picric acid, to prevent the possibility of them being sold for food, and yet to permit of them being disposed of for other purposes. Dwellings of the Poor.-The interest awakened on the subject of the unhealthy dwellings in which the poor live by a series of addresses delivered by Dr. Russell, as President of the Philosophical Society, has borne fruit much more speedily than was anticipated, and of a very satisfactory character, The Town Council, who, under the operation of the City Improvement Act, had acquired some of the worst property in the city, and were unable, owing to the decline in prices, to realise it satisfactorily, have been com pelled to acknowledge themselves as among the worst sinners of the landlord class. Before calling upon other landlords to set their houses in order they have proceeded to attend to their own. Extensive alterations and reconstructions are being carried out in some of the worst property in consequence. Another result has been a public movement to establish a company, on lines similar to some in existence in London, for providing healthy homes for the poor. A Social Union has been formed, with those and similar aims, and under its auspices, only a few weeks ago, the first steps were taken for the formation of such a company, it being inti mated at the preliminary meeting that ?10,000 was already pro mised towards the capital of the company, were it successfully launched. Sewage.-The disposal of the city sewage is still the unsolved problem of the municipal authorities; but an experiment is likely to be made in treating a portion of the sewage (that from the east end of the town) by chemical precipitation. The opportunity is offered, owing to railway operations rendering necessary extensive reconstruction and alteration of sewers, the expense of which the railways must bear. Population.-Dr. Russell's last estimate of the population living within the municipal area is 551,478 persons, an increase of 6,169 on last year. This number, of course, excludes the suburbs, which are likely soon to be brought within the city boundaries, the op position of several having by recent elections been shown to be contrary to the wishes of their inhabitants. The population of Greater Glasgow is somewhere between 750,000 and 760,000. The Infirmaries seem to be, like the city, beginning to feel the influence of improved trade. The annual exces3 of ordinary ex penditure over ordinary revenue is lower this year than for pre vious years; and the public claims upon them are almost always more than they can fully overtake. The new infirmary on the South side-the Victoria Infirmary-is soon to be opened, which will place an additional 80 beds at the service of the public. At the MaternityHospital Dr. Murdoch Cameron performed his second successful case of Caesarean section, the former case having been performed last year. -Lunacy in Scotland.-The thirty-first annual report of the Commissioners in Lunacy for Scotland shows a total increase in the number of registered lunatics of 345; the increase in 1888 over the previous year was 304. The increase was made up of 244 pauper lunatics, 96 private, and 5 in the lunatic department of the General Prison. The total numbers at January 1st, 1889, were 5,612 male lunatics and 6,342 female lunatics, a total of 11,954, which is equal to a proportion of 289 per 100.000 of the popula tion. In England and Wales the proportion is 290.7, and in Ire land 360. The increase in the number of lunatics chargeable to parishes has become a source of much anxiety to parochial boards, many of whom are compelled to face the question of largely in creased accommodation. ABERDEEN. Extension of University Buildings.-Thle Teachinq Staf.-Univer sity Fellowships and PIrizes. - Gifford Lectures. - Thomson Lectures.-Students.-Assessors. Extension of University Buildings.-The scheme to meet this much felt want of more extensive buildings has now reached something like a half-way stage. The various lecturerooms designed fornatural history, physiology, medical jurisprudence, and materia medica are now either occupied or fit for occupation. Some of these de partments, having, in the past, been destitute of lecture rooms of their own it may safely be anticipated that the convenience and comfort of both lecturer and students will be greatly increased. Meanwhile the erection of the building which is to contain the new laboratories is being rapidly proceeded with; and when they are fully equipped the various departments will be very complete. As may be readily understood, these additions will greatly in crease the area occupied by Marischal College, but, unfortunately, this extension will not free the College from its hampering and ungainly environments. The opening up of the classic front of the building to Broad Street bulked largely in the minds of the citizens of Aberdeen during the recent municipal elections. In fact it almost seemed to be a test question, Whether the candidate was in favour of the opening up of Marischal College to Broad Street ? And, as all the candidates professed their desire for this improvement, it is surely not too much to hope that we are within measurable distance of this long-delayed duty being taken up and carried to a successful end by the new Town Council. The Teaching Staff.-The only change in the teaching staff at Marischal College has been that caused by the resignation of Dr. Struthers, who had filled the chair of anatomy since 1863, in suc cession to Professor Lizars, and the appointment as his successor of Dr. R. W. Reid, who had been joint lecturer on inatomy for many years at St. Thomas's Hospital. University Fellowships and Prizes.-The Thomson fellowship, which may be termed the blue ribbon for young graduates in medicine, as it enables its holder to spend some time abroad un trammelled in the cultivation of original research, has fallen this year to Arthur R. Cushine, M.A., M.B., C.M., who recently graduated with highest honours in medicine and surgery. Another new prize is the Strachan medical bursary, competed for at the beginning of the fourth year of medical study, and has been awarded this year to Mr. Levack. The bursary was placed at this stage of the curriculum as an incentive to the study of thera peutics and clinical medicine, and its value has been fully appre ciated by the students. Giford Lectures.-The crowded audiences, comprising profes sors, graduates, students, and the general public, and their enthusiastic reception of Dr. E. B. Tylor, D.C.L., F.R.S., go, so far, to show that the Senatus has been successful in securing the services of a lecturer who, at any rate, is able to attract and also to interest those who attend. The clerical element is marked at these lectures, and their watchful attendance will the better be understood if it be remembered that the ?20,000 left by Lord Gifford was for the foundation of a lectureship having for its ob ject " the promoting, advancing, teaching, and diffusing the study of natural theology." The lecturers need not belong to any religious denomination, and they sign no test. They are appointed for two years, and may be twice reappointed for other two. Thomson Lectures.-The first half of this course, given by Dr. Donald MacAlister, of Cambridge, has just been delivered in the Hall of the Free Church College. The subject was "Germs and Disease," and large and enthusiastic audiences, comprising many students and other members of the University, testified to the interest which the lecturer succeeded in arousing.</page><page sequence="45">Dec. 28, 1889.] yHE BRITISs MEDICAL JOURNAL. 14?7 Students.-The attendance of students at Marischal College is still in advance of former years. Assessors.-The Senatus Academicus appointed as its assessors to the University Court Professors Stephenson, Hay, and Pirie; the fourth assessorship is held by Professor Milligan, whose term of office is still unexpired. The medical faculty is represented by two members of the Senatus. MEDICAL EVENTS OF THE YEAR IN IRELAND. The Amalgamation of Dublin Schools.-Professional lonours. Typhoid in Dublin.-The Dublin Hospitals Bill.-The Dublin Branch.-Dublin Barracks.-Sir E. Guinness's Gift. The Amalqamation of Dublin Schools.-One of the most im portant events of the year is the amalgamation of medical schools in Dublin. The number, which heretofore was five, has now been reduced to three, a number quite sufficient to promote and keep alive beneficial rivalry. The project was first brought before the College of Surgeons a few years ago and was defeated, but in 1887 Mr. Thomson succeeded in carrying a motion requesting the Coun cil to take steps to effect an amalgamation of the Carmichael and Ledwich, both of which were proprietary schools, with the school of the College. The Council subsequently submitted a scheme which was carried by the Fellows after some opposition. Many interests were affected by this change, and the settlement of various claims demanded time and the exercise of much tact and patience. Ultimately, however, all obstacles were overcome, and the conjoined school is now in full swing with a class of 290 stu dents. Most of the lecturers in the schools have been made pro fessors in the College, and this has the disadvantage of diminish ing the value of the chairs in a pecuniary sense, but provision is made that as vacancies occur these shall not be filled up until the number of professors reaches a fixed number, when the in come will become proportionately valuable to the holders. Professional Honours.-The profession in Ireland, after long ex pectation and delay, has at last received some recognition from the State. Sir George Porter, one of the surgeons to the Queen, who was knighted some years ago, received the further honour of a baronetcy from Her Majesty, and has had the hearty congratula tions of his friends. In the case of Dr. Banks, one of the Queen's physicians, and President of the Association in the year of its last visit to Dublin, Her Majesty was pleased to confer the distinction of K.C.B. His elevation waas very popular, and it was marked by his being the guest of the evening at the first dinner of the old &amp;tudents of the Richmond, Whitworth, and Hardwicke Hospitals, of which he is senior physician. The banquet was attended by many distinguished guests, and was altogether a brilliant gather ing. Dr. Meldon, the President of the College of Surgeons, has been made a deputy-lieutenant of the city of Dublin. Dr. Aquilla Smith, for so many years a representative on the General Medical Council, having resigned his position, was presented with his por trait by the Fellows of the College of Physicians, and received the expression of their deep:regret at the loss of his valuable services. More recently the Honorary Fellowship of the College of Surgeons has been conferred upon Mr. Thomas Heazle Parke, for his distin guished labours in the expedition of Mr. H. M. Stanley across Africa. The honour is very well deserved. Mr. Parke is a young officer of the Army Medical Department, and Mr. Stanley has ex pressed unstinted praise of the services which Mr. Parke has ren dered the explorer and his whole party. Typhoid in Dublin.-During the autumn there was an outbreak of typhoid fever in Dublin, which for a few weeks was rather fatal. The origin could not be clearly traced, although the public freely declared that it 'was to be found in the eating of oysters which had been taken from impure beds. Undoubtedly there were many cases of severe diarrhcea following from this cause. Tn a certain proportion of cases the disease was contracted ini Paris during the exhibition, and this accounts probably for the fact that there has been an increase of it in several large towns in Ireland and elsewhere. The outbreak is now disappearing from Dublin. The Dublin Hospital8 Bill.-At the close of the last session the Government introduced a Bill dealing with the parliamentary grants to Dublin hospitals, and based upon the report of the recent commission. There was no chance of such a measure passing at such a date (August), and the measure was accordingly withdrawn, &amp; promise being made that it would again be brought forward in 1890. The main proposals are to reduce the total grant by ?4,500 a year; to hand over the bulk sum to a board for distribution; and that no hospital shall benefit which has not fifty pupils'and eighty beds. As the provisions apply they will force the closure of the Richmond, Whitworth, and Hardwicke Hospitals, which, being entirely supported by grant, could not on the withdrawal of ?7,600 keep even one bed open. We have pointed out some defects of the measure as they appear, and no doubt those who are interested, and who will be adversely affected, will make their views known when the subject again comes up for discussion. At present, at all events, the Bill does nothing more than provide for a redristribution of funds, and the benefit to be derived from this bas not been made apparent. TheDublin Branch.-The twelfth annual meeting of the Dublin Branch was held on January 30th, when Dr. W. Moore, Physician to the Queen, was elected President for the year. The meeting was made the occasion of presenting an address to the outgoin president, Dr. Mapother, on his removing to London. It was signed by the heads of the colleges and by nearly every hospital phy sician and surgeon in Dublin, and was a gratifying testimony to Dr. Mapother's great popularity and professional eminence. In March Mr. Lambert Ormsby resigned his position as Honorary Secretary and Treasurer, and received the thanks of the Council for the zeal and ability with which he had discharged his duties. Dr. Conolly Norman was appointed his successor by unanimous vote. Dublin Barracks.-The condition of the Dublin barracks re ceived frequent notice in Parliament during the year. Frequently recurring outbreaks of typhoid among the officers and men gave these buildings, particularly the Royal Barracks, an unenviable notoriety. Finally, with regard to the last named, it was found necessary to remove the troops altogether, and to place them under canvas. This was done in the awtumn. The Royal Barracks haue since been in the contractor's hands, and extensive alterations are being made with the hope that they will be made more sani tary than they have been. The opinion of Dr. Grimshaw and Sir C. Cameron is that the chronic condition of unhealthiness is due to the fact that the building is erected on a gravel bed, which is itself on a layer of impervious clay, and that the leakage from imperfect sewers is retained in the gravel, owing to the formation just mentioned. Mr. Field's report is referred to at page 960, vol. i, 1889, of the JOURNAL. Sir B. C. Guinness's Gift.-The remarkable generosity of Sir Edward Guinness, who has given ?200,000 to London and ?50,000 to Dublin for providing dwellings for the poor, deserves to be specially recorded. The purpose to which this money is to be de voted is a wise one, and may serve as a beginning of the solution of that large problem, how are the poor of large towns to be healthily housed. The trustees are engaged in devising a scheme in accordance with the donor's desires, and before another year passes we hope to see some of the good effects which are ex pected. PROVIDENT AND BENEVOLENT 'INSTITUTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. Briti8h MedicalBenemolent Fund.-The proceedings of this charity during the year 1889 have well sustained the past reputation of the fund for useful and unobtrusive help. The Grant Department, through which sums, varying from ?5 to ?20 are given to applicants duly recommended and vouched for by a'subscriber's signature, after approval by the Committee without any vexatious canvassing of Governors, printing of cards, or other publicity, has disbursed ?1,594 among 149 applicants up to the end of November, which is fully up to the average. The last meeting of the year falling upon December 31st, prevents the rendering of a full account. These grants are generally given by instalments, weekly or monthly, distributed through the instrumentality of the Cheque Bank, or through honorary local secretaries, or, in instances where it is felt by the Committee that the assistance rendered by the prompt payment of a sum may prevent the necessity of any future applications, directly by the treasurer. In the Annuity Department the selection of annuitants is managed somewhat differently. A subcommittee selects from a list of those who have received grants, are over 60 years of age and are without income or assistance from a sister charity, those most deserving, and these candidates are submitted to the General Committee in May and November. The total number of annuitants now re ceiving ?1 13s. 4d. a month is 58, and there are in addition 7 medical men who, thanks to a special fund, are in receipt of 10s. a week. Six annuitants of ?20 each were elected in May, and six more will be elected in January, 1890; besides these, two were elected " Dunlap Gift Annuitants," as directed by the will of Mrs.</page><page sequence="46">1478 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. [Dec. 28, 1889. Dunlap, being " widows of medical men without other provision." Several valuable legacies have been received, and the interest will be applied to the creation of fresh annuities. Mr. Parker Young left the Committee, and Dr. Stocker was elected in his stead. The working of the fund has been carried out in the same economical manner as usual by the help of its honorary officers, no one being paid with the exception of the collector. Subscriptions, due on January 1st, should be paid to Dr. Sidney Phillips, Honorary Financial Secretary, 21, Upper Berkeley Street, W. Society for Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men. During the current year, a sum of ?2,741 has been distributed among 63 widows, 14 orphans, and 3 orphans on the Copeland Fund. Fresh applications for grants have been received from 2 widows and 2 orphans, and assistance has been given them. Through the deaths of 3 widows, and 2 orphans becoming ineligible through age, grants to the amount of ?157 have fallen in, and fresh grants amounting to ?74 per annum have been made. The ex penses of the year have been ?301 4s. 8d. Twentv-three new members have been elected, 6 members have died, 2 resigned, and 6 have ceased to be members, the number of members at the present time being 334. The expenses of the Charity for the year have been ?301. Legacies have been received from the following: Miss Wilson, ?50; Miss Caspar, ?1,000; Mrs. Ely-Douglas, ?35 2s. 2d. (remainder). The Society early in the year lost the valuable ser vices of Mr. Fuller, who had filled the office of Acting Treasurer for 16 years. Dr. IPotter was elected in his place. The offices of the Society are now at 20, Hanover Square, where, the Secretary attends every Wednesday and Friday from 4 to 5, to give any information respecting the Society that may be desired. The Society is re stricted to members of the medical profession living within a rad;us of 20 miles from Charing Cross, and the benefits of the Society can only be given to the widows and orphans of deceased members of not less than 3 years' standing. Royal Medical Benevolent College, Epsom.-Epsom College, under its new head master, the Rev. T. N. Hart Smith, late of Marlborough College, has been doing good work during the past year. The Council have built a new class room for the students of the natural sciences, proviping the best instruments for their use; and a natural history society has been started upon the lines of a similar institute which has been so productive of good results at Marlborough. Epsom College is conducted as a first-rate public school with a medical foundation, and various privileges that are reserved to the medical profession, but in every other respect open to all classes alike. The educational work has been carefully arranged on the system that has proved so success ful at Wellington College, Haileybury, Marlborough, and other public schools; on the classical side the best training is given for the universities and the learned professions; the modern side has been tabulated to meet the requirements of the London Univer sity, the Army, and the Civil Service. There is also a class in which boys are prepared for commercial pursuits. For boys who are intended for the medical profession no school in England pos sesses equal advantages; special training is provided for the Lon don matriculation and preliminary scientific examinations, and, owing to the generosity of the London hospitals, there are seven scholarships, ranging in value from 90 to 125 guineas, offered annually to leaving boys. For the encouragement of classics, there are several very valuable prizes in money and books, and one exhibition every year of ?50, tenable for three years at the universities. A munificent benefaction lately received from Dr. Haviland and his brother, MIr. F. G. Haviland, has provided two exhibitions of ?60 a year each of four years. One of these exhi bitions will be awarded every alternate year for proficiency in natural science, the holder declaring his intention to graduate in medicine at the University of Cambridge. The late Dr. Harvey Owen has bequeathed the sum of ?1,620, to found an exhibition for foundation scholars or the orphans of medical men, to be held at one of the universities. Six scholarships of smaller value, held in the School, are offered annually, and the Council award several valuable exhibitions which are restricted to sons of medical men under certain conditions. OBITUARY FOR 1889. England. During the past year it has been our duty to chronicle the deaths of several men of great eminence in the medical profession. Among physicians we may recall such well-known names as those of C. J. B. Williams, C. B. Radcliffe, S. 0. Habershon, G. Owen Rees, T. K. Chambers, Charles Elam, and Protheroe Smith, all men who had lived to the full ripeness of their years, and who had worthily accomplished the work that it was in them to do. Far otherwise was it with the lamented Leonard C. Wooldridge, who was cut off in the early blossom of his rich scientific promise. English surgery has to mourn the loss of Haynes Walton and Walter J. Coulson. Among men of general distinction may be mentioned Dr. Joseph Rogers, whose name should be held in eternal honour by the poor of this country, and by the practi tioners whose especial duty and privilege it is to give them such medical succour as they require; Sir W. Tindal Robertson, M.P. for Brighton; Dr. John Percy, who would undoubtedly have risen to the first rank in medicine had he not preferred another sphere of activity; and MIr. Henry James Wolfenden Johnstone, whose health compelled him prematurely to abandon a profession in which he was exceptionally fitted to excel. Among others who have valiantly done their duty in their chosen province of professional work may be mentioned Dr. L. T. Cumberbatch, Dr. C. Royston, and Mr. James Lattey, well-known general practitioners in the West End of London; Mr. George Woods and Mr. Henry Lowndes, of Liverpool; Dr. James Beddard, of Nottingham; Dr. J. B. Wright, of Southsea; Mr. John Jobson, of Bishop Auckland; Mr. James Barron, of Sunderland; Mr. C. J. Mloore, who died of diph theria contracted by sucking the tracheotomy tube of his own child; Mr. L. P. Jackson, of Plymouth, who died in his early prime, of scarlet fever, a martyr to duty in the truest sense of the words; and Dr. W. P. Davis, physician to the British Ambassador at Paris. Mr. Percival Leigh, a well-known and highly esteemed contri butor to the leading comic journal for upwards of half a century, should not be forgotten. Scotland. We have to record the deaths, during the past year, of the following honoured members of the profession: Dr. R. Paterson, Leith; Mr. R. Hogue, Edinburgh; Dr. Alex. Sinclair, Edinburgh; Dr. Murray Gibson, Portobello; and Dr. Wm. Strettel Miller, Edinburgh. Dr. Alexander Mackintosh, late of the Royal Luna tic Asylum at Glasgow; Dr. John Mackenzie, of Tighnabruaich, and Dr. James Mlaclaren, of the Stirling District Asylum, Larbert. Ireland. The deatlh of RobDert 'McDonnell, F.R.S., on Mlay 5th last, was a serious calamity to the profession at large. He had just returned from a holiday, taken for the benefit of his health, when he sud denly died, presumably from aneurysm. He had only closed his 61st year, and was at the height of popularity and of profes sional distinction. Robert MIcDonnell had done excellent scientific work, and he was, some years ago, made a Fellow of the Royal Society. Hle had served on many Royal Commissions, and he was a member of that upon the education and employment of the blind at the time of his death. He was a very able surgeon, and above all, a pure and just man. Dr. J. Rutherfoord Kirkpatrick, Professor of Midwifery in the University of Dublin, also died during the year, and was very generally lamented. Ile was a man of singularly retiring manner, but he was a good practical teacher, and was popular with his pupils. We must add the name of Dr. J. Cuffey, who met a tragic death with many others on board the Duke of Buccleuchi, which was sunk by a collision in the EDglish Channel in April last. He had been house-surgeon to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, and he was taking a voyage as ship's surgeon when he was drowned. Dr. Cuffey was a very brilliant man, and his melancholy death has caused universal regret among his teachers and old fellow-students. Dr. McNab, Professor of Botany in the College of Science, died suddenly of heart disease early in December at the age of 45. I-e was a most able lecturer, and his reputation as a scientist was very wide spread. One of the best known of Dublin practitioners was Mr. Edward Alexander Stoker, F.R.C.S.I., who died on January 18th, 1889, aged 81. Ile was in his early days a very successful teacher of anatomy, and for many years he was one of the Examining Board at the College of Surgeons. He remained in harness prac tically to the last, and his death was deeply deplored. *** Owing to the space occupied by the Annual Retrospect, numerous letters, notices, and other communications are unavoid ably crowded out.</page></plain_text>
