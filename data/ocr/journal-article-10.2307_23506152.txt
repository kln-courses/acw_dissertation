Accordingly, I present briefly some of the material from Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Josephus, Graeco Jewish writers, and rabbinic literature. I have deemed it un necessary to repeat all the legendary narratives; Philo tells us no narratives about Abraham; moreover, Ginzberg and Beer have assembled this material so that it is unnecessary here to reproduce it. I have culled from rabbinic literature some leading motifs about Abraham of a non-narrative character, derived often from the ingenuities of biblical interpretation. First, one needs to recall that material about Abraham is found throughout the Bible beyond Gen. 12-25. The earliest mention in the literary prophets seems to be in Deutero-Isaiah. A summary of earlier history in Josh. 24 tells that Terah, Abraham's father, was a worshiper of strange gods but Abraham worshiped God.1 Neh. 9.7 states that it was God (not, as in Gen. 11.31, Terah) who brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees. A very obscure allusion, Isa. 29.22, speaks of God's redeeming Abraham; the phrase is regarded by Marti,2 and probably correctly, as a very late gloss based on material sub sequently developed elaborately in rabbinic writings: LXX 1 Josh. 24.2. 2 Das Buck Jesaja, 1900, 218.</page><page sequence="2">152 SAMUEL SANDMEL [2] renders 3דה by αφώρίσβρ and supplies a preposition making the phrase mean the house of Jacob "which He separated out out of Abraham."3 A number of passages allude passingly to events or places associated with Abraham: the double cave;4 the famine in Abraham's day;5 the wells dug with Abimelech;6 his residence in Hebron.7 God's covenant with Abraham and His promises to him are matters of frequent reference and allusion. Both the promises (especially of the inheritance of Canaan) and the covenant are repeated in generations after Abraham with specific recollection of Abraham. So, to Isaac;8 to Jacob;9 to Menasseh and Ephraim;10 to Joseph's brothers;11 to Moses;12 to all Israel;13 to Caleb and Joshua.14 While explicit reference to the covenant or promises is not present in the case of Elijah, he is recorded as praying to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel.15 The Chronicler portrays Jehoshaphat as praying to the "God of our fathers"16 who gave the land to "Abraham Thy beloved."17 The Psalmist terms the covenant an eternal one, commanded to the thousandth generation, made with Abraham, sworn to Isaac, established as a statute to Jacob, and an eternal covenant with Israel.18 3 This is probably a tendentious rendering, designed to exclude Esau and his descendants from the benefits of descent from Abraham. Such sentiments are voiced in rabbinic writings and in Jubilees, as we shall see. יי Gen. 49.30-31 and 50.13. 3 Gen. 26.1. 6 Gen. 26.15, !8• ' Gen. 35.27. 8 Gen. 26.3. י Gen. 28.4, 35.12. 10 Gen. 48.16. 11 Gen. 50.24. 12 12 Ex. 33.1 and Deut. 1.8.

The recollection of this covenant prompts God to save Israel. The prelude to the calling of Moses is God's hearing the outcry of the children of Israel and His recollection of His cove nant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.19 After the golden calf incident, God proposes to Moses that He destroy Israel and raise a new people out of Moses; Moses' reply in part is to re mind God of His servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the promises to them; accordingly God withholds the evil He had spoken of.20 When Israel was in the wilderness, God remembered Abraham His servant, and brought out Israel in joy and singing.21 The conquest of Palestine came not as a result of the righteous ness of Israel, but because of the unrighteousness of the Canaan ites and because of God's desire to fulfill his promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.22 In the days of Jehoaz God graciously has mercy on Israel for the sake of the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.23 God is identifiable by being spoken of as the God of Abraham. God so identifies Himself to Isaac24 and to Jacob.25 It was the God of Abraham and Isaac who prevented Laban from defraud ing Jacob.26 The covenant between Jacob and Laban is sealed by the "heap of stones" ; we are told 27 that "the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor will judge between us, the God of their fathers." The passage has troubled the modern commentators almost as much as it has the rabbinic interpreters.28 It seems to accord equal rank to both Nahor's God and to Abraham's. MT reads "judge" as a plural; LXX renders it as a singular, " Ex. 2.23-24■ 20 Ex. 32.13; similarly, Deut. 9.25-29. 21 Ps. 105.42. 22 Deut. 9.5. « II Kings 13.22-25. 2יי Gen. 26.24. 2^ Gen. 28.13. 26 Gen. 31.42. 2י Gen. 31.53. 28 Cf. Morgenstern, A Jewish Interpretation of the Book of Genesis, 263.</page><page sequence="4">154 SAMUEL SANDMEL [4] undoubtedly a deliberate alteration. The Targumim retain the plural. Rabbinic interpreters struggle with the verse.29 God identifies Himself to Moses as the God of Moses' fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,30 and instructs Moses to identify Him to the children of Israel in the same way.31 So, too, Ex. 6.3 which states that Abraham knew God as El Shaddai and not as Yahweh. Jacob, in prayer, addresses God as the God of Abraham and of Isaac;32 so, also, Elijah33 and David.34 The letters which Hezekiah sends out urging repentance instruct the readers to return to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The children of Israel are described as "seed of Abraham";35 Ps. 105.6 uses the phrase which in another version, I Chron. 16.13, reads "seed of Israel."36 Abraham is the rock whence Israel is hewn; pursuers of righteousness are bidden to look to him; God will comfort Zion.37 Abraham is God's beloved and Israel is his seed.38 Abraham is God's servant.39 Israel is the people of the God of Abraham.40 The land of Palestine was given to the seed of Abraham, God's beloved.41 The summary in a passage in Neh. 9.7 ff., gives in a kind of digest form the biblical view of the career of Abraham. The one God created the universe and is the Master of it. God chose Abram, brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and changed his name to Abraham. God found his heart faithful 29 Cf. Rashi and Ibn Ezra ad loc. 30 Ex. 3.6. 31 Ex. 3.15-16. 32 Gen. 32.10. 33 I Kings 18.36. 34 I Chron. 29.18. 35 Jer. 33.26 and II Chron. 20.7. 36 Ibn Ezra to I Chron. 16.13 notes the different readings and declares that they are justified since the seed of Abraham is the same as the seed of Israel. 3י Isa. 51.1-3. 38 Isa. 41.8. 39 Ps. 105.42. ■י" Ps. 47.10. 4' II Chron. 20.7.</page><page sequence="5">[5] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 155 before Him; he made a covenant with him to give to his seed the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebu sites, and Girgashites. In His righteousness, God had fulfilled His word. One additional passage remains to be cited, as if in contradic tion of all that has been cited above: God is Israel's Father; Abra ham has not known them, nor has the patriarch Israel recognized them; God is the Redeemer from eternity.42 The passage seems to say quite clearly that neither the fatherhood of Abraham nor that of Jacob is of any avail, for the true Fatherhood is that of God. Ingenuity might tend to remove the apparent contradiction; indeed, the rabbis infer from the passage that in this instance it is the unmentioned Isaac whose merit is the saving force,43 while elsewhere the difficulty is removed by asserting that Abraham did not rescue Israel from Egypt and Jacob did not rescue Israel in the desert.44 The presence of a discordant note in an assemblage of biblical passages should not disturb us unduly; it is quite easy for people to hold on to different and contradictory attitudes; or to do what the rabbis did in this case, to interpret the discordant verse in such a way that it becomes concordant. To summarize, the biblical Abraham is presented to us in a quasi-biographical form, as in Genesis; his achievements and character are set forth at some length. Certain clear motifs are discernible: Abraham was chosen by God; by implication he was the first to worship the true God; God made with him a covenant renewed generation after generation with his seed; Abraham was a saving force for Lot, and Abraham's merit remained a saving force for later generations; Abraham was an exemplar of fidelity, obedience, hospitality, and military prowess. Abraham withstood a testing of his faith. Abraham was a prophet, a servant and beloved of God. As the patri arch, he was a progenitor of sons, and his sons, his seed, pos sess the memory of what Abraham did as a saving force for themselves. 42 Isa. 63.16. 43 Shabbal '89b. 44 Targum, ad loc. Cf. also Rashi and Redaq.</page><page sequence="6">156 SAMUEL SANDMEL [6] Turning to the non-canonical material, the trial through which Judith and the elders were passing was not as extreme as the trials through which God put Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.43 The fathers46 were Chaldeans whose neighbors cast them out because they would not worship the ancestral gods, but the God of heaven, Whom they knew. They fled into Mesopotamia.47 Sanctification is to come upon the Messiah as God's voice48 came from heaven to Abraham and Isaac.4' In the present age intercession by one on behalf of another is possible, in the manner in which Abraham prayed for Sodom, but such inter cession will not be possible in messianic times.50 The acts of the Samaritans are not surprising, for they had persecuted Abraham and tried to violate Sarah.51 The heavenly Jerusalem had been revealed to Abraham at the Covenant between the Pieces.52 The Law had been given to Abraham who had fulfilled it; it included the belief in the coming judgment, in the messianic age, and resurrection.55 As Abraham was faithful in trial and reckoned righteous, so should his descendants have zeal for the Law.54 In transmitting the Law, Benjamin followed the pattern of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.55 Abraham is recorded as the friend of God,56 because he kept the commandments of 45 Judith, VIII, 2&amp;-27• 46 Abraham, rather than "the fathers," is the usual hero of the conflict with Chaldean neighbors; see below, page 159.

Only the house of Abraham was taught Hebrew. Nimrod and others chose angels but Abraham chose God. Only the house of Abraham chose God and abided with Him.72 The seed of Abraham is synonymous with the word Jew.73 Bilhah and Zilpah, the wives of Jacob, were of the family of Abraham.74 Abraham had other descendants, such as the Spartans.75 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will arise unto life in messianic times.76 They will rejoice at the coming of the Messiah.77 Two allusions of a colorless variety occur in résumés of history.78 Abraham appears in the above sources in little more than allusions. He obeyed the Law, and commanded it to his off spring. He is an exemplar for his descendants to emulate. His merit is a reservoir of grace for them. Reunion of his seed (or, at least, his righteous seed) with him will take place in messianic times. Abraham abides in some ancestral place, awaiting that joyous moment. ד- Enoch XCIII, 5. 77 App. Test. Naph. VIII-X. 73 IV Macc. VI, 17, 22; XVIII, 1,21; Psalms of Solomon IX, 17; XVIII, 4. Test.

Abraham is portrayed in the Bible, it will be recalled, as the father of many nations. The question of the "true" seed arises only when an exclusivist advantage is desired; otherwise an all-inclusive common ancestry is admissible. The rabbis ( Yal. Shim. 904) classify Sarah as a daughter of Shem, Hagar a daughter of Ham, and Keturah a daughter of Japhet; this would mean that nations of all three races of mankind stem from Abraham. 76 Test.

The Samaritans wronged him; he did not marry outside the faith; the Hebrew language was given to him and to his seed. These writings do not really tell about Abraham. They allude to him as though the simple allusion is sufficient for the reader's understanding. It is implicit that he is the great ancestor who abides and whose merit abides. We see that Abraham is implicit, but we do not really see Abraham. His importance to the writers, and by inference to the readers, is such that they feel no need to go into details. Abraham has become intimately part of their assumptions and pre-dispositions. The author of Jubilees provides as the setting for the birth and wondrous youth of Abraham an agricultural crisis brought on by Mastema, the chief of the malignant spirits.75 Ravens and birds eat all the seeds which Terah and others plant, with the result that the yield of the earth is only large enough barely to preserve life. Terah at this point married Edna, the daughter of Abram.80 Our Abraham was named for his grandfather who died before the birth of the baby.81 Abraham perceives that all the world is going astray after graven images and uncleanness. His father teaches him writing. At the age of twenty82 he separates himself from Terah so as to avoid idolatry, and he prays to be spared participation in the errors of his fellowmen.83 In his fourteenth year Abraham has יי Mastema is mentioned in Hos. 9.7-8. In Jubilees X, Noah prays to God that all the evil spirits may be imprisoned so that they cannot exert their dire influence on men. Mastema protests that unless some spirits are left in his control he will be unable to lead men astray. The decision arrived at is to imprison all but a tenth of the evil spirits. 80 Rabbinic sources name her Emtelai, B. B. 91a. On this name and the name Abram assigned to the grandfather, see Ginzberg, op. cit. V, 208-209, and Beer, op. cit., 96-97. I cite these henceforth simply as Ginzberg or Beer. 81 Jub. XI, n-15. 82 The rabbis allocate this event to the age one, or three, but usually forty-eight. See below, page 198. 85 Jub. XI, 16-17.</page><page sequence="10">160 SAMUEL SANDMEL [10] power over the ravens, and drives them away.84 By this action Abraham becomes famous throughout Chaldea. Abraham in the next year teaches the people how to make ploughs so that the seeds, buried in the earth, cannot be stolen by the ravens.85 This narrative is peculiar to Jubilees and does not reappear in rabbinic literature. In his twenty-fourth year Abraham appeals to Terah to desist from fruitless idolatry and to turn to the true God. Terah replies that he is aware of the truth that Abraham speaks, but that he fears the people who would slay him for desisting from idolatry; he warns Abraham of this danger, enjoining silence on him. When Abraham is sixty he sets fire, in the middle of the night, to the family house. Haran, his brother, rushes in to save the idols and he perishes in the flames.86 Terah takes his sons to Haran. When Abraham is seventy-five he sits up all the evening of the New Year to learn from the stars what the New Year would provide in the way of rain. He becomes aware that the heavenly bodies are the servants of God, and that He, not they, controls the rains. Abraham prays to be withheld from the error of going astray by worshiping the heavenly bodies. In reply, the command is delivered by the "angel of the Presence"87 for Abraham to quit his native land.88 At God's command the ministering angel teaches Abraham 84 The incident seems based on Gen. 15.11, the descent of the עיט which Abraham drives away. 85 Jub. XI, 16-20. 86 Jub. XII, 1-14. The narrative seems to be derived from a play on ' Ur as synonymous with 'or, fire. The same play underlies a somewhat different rabbinic narrative, of Nimrod's casting Abraham into the fiery furnace from which God saves him; in the latter story Haran is undecided about throwing in his lot with Abraham until after the miraculous rescue; the forces which saved Abraham, however, permitted Haran to die in the fiery furnace. Cf. Ginzberg, I, 198-202. Jubilees does not seem to know the legend of Abraham in the fiery furnace. Possibly both of these legends circulated as expansions of the word 'Ur, and the author of Jubilees preferred the present legend to the one preserved in the rabbis; Isa. 29.22 may be an allusion to Abraham in the fiery furnace. 87 Ostensibly the author of Jubilees; cf. Jub. I. 88 Gen. 12.1-3 is quoted, and then there is added that God is Abraham's God and destined to be the God of Abraham's seed, Jub.

Abraham takes the books of his fathers, tran scribes them, and studies them, receiving help where it is needed from the angel. Abraham busies himself with these books for the six rainy months.89 Thereafter90 Abraham informs Terah that he is going to Canaan. Terah blesses him, and asks him to return for him if Abraham should find some land.91 Abraham travels, as the biblical account narrates, to Canaan. He comes to the lofty oak92 where he builds an altar.93 He is delighted with the details of the agricultural richness of the land.94 Moving to the mountain,95 he builds an altar and offers a sacrifice96 at the new moon of the first month, and proclaims, in calling on the name of God, "Thou, the Eternal God, art my God."97 His southward journey98 is related with the addition of the mention of Hebron and Bealoth.99 Three years later, on the coming of famine, he goes to Egypt for five years.100 The seizure of Sarah is passed over quickly, 89 Jub. XII, 15-27• This portrayal of Abraham learning Hebrew is as naive a touch of depicting a contemporaneous matter by reading it into Abraham's life as I have encountered. This matter is peculiar to Jubilees. Cf. App. Test. Naph. VIII-X. 90 The next episode took place in the fifth year of the sixth week, the departure from Haran in the seventh year. It does not seem possible to harmonize these dates with the six months mentioned in Jub. XII, 27. 91 Jub. XII, 28-30. 92 This description rests on LXX Gen. 12.6, which MT calls the oak of More.More. This is one of several passages in which it appears that the text we have of Jubilees in places conforms, or has been made to conform, to the LXX. Cf. Charles, II, 4-5. '3 Jub. XIII, 1-5. '4 Jub.

Abraham regrets Lot's departure for wicked Sodom because Abraham has no offspring. God tells him10" that he will have seed which will inherit the land. The war of the kings is only partly preserved, and what is preserved shows evidence of being greatly compressed.105 The tithe which Abraham gives Melchizedek, a tithe of first fruits, is ordained by God to Abraham's descendants eternally; the tithe is to be given of seed, wine, oil, cattle and sheep. God gives these tithes to His priests to eat in joy.106 Jubilees XV, 1-16 recapitulates the events of Gen. 15 with almost no variations from the biblical account. The LXX is followed in making "Masek" a handmaid.107 Jubilees adds that the events take place near Hebron, and specifies that Abraham offers the sacrifices on an altar which he builds.108 The singular 'ayit'ayit of MT Gen. 15.11 is replaced with the plural "birds" of the LXX;109 the tardema of MT Gen. 15.13 is represented by the ecstasis of the LXX.110 Jubilees portrays Abraham as awaken ing before the smoke and fire111 pass between the "pieces."112 Jubilees adds a conclusion not found in Genesis, that Abraham offers the various animals and birds and the drink offerings as a sacrifice.113 101 Jub.

God appears to Abraham, enjoins him to be perfect, changes his name from Abram to Abraham, and commands him to circumcise himself and his household. Apart from allocating the incident at Shabuot, Jubilees follows the account in Gen. 17. 17.1-23 faithfully. There is added, however, apparently from the LXX, a command missing in MT, Gen. 17.14, that one not circumcised "on the eighth day" is to be cut off from his people. Jubilees adds to the recapitulation of the account in Genesis a series of observations about circumcision: this command is eternal, and it must take place on the eighth day, and it is a commandment written on the heavenly tablets. One who is not circumcised does not belong to the children of the covenant, and has on him no sign that he is the Lord's. He is a son of destruction, destined to be destroyed from the earth. The angels of the Presence and the angels of Sanctification were created circumcised. The offspring of Ishmael and Esau (apparently even though they practiced circumcision) were not chosen by God to be His people; it was Israel whom He chose. These other peoples have over them spirits who can lead them astray, but Israel is led by God. It is known that the children of Israel will not observe this commandment, but treating their members like Gentiles, will forsake the covenant. There will be no pardon or forgiveness for these."8 The words are unquestionably directed against the hellenizers of the period. Abraham does what is proper; the hellenizers do not. contemporaneous Temple worship. The rabbis on the other hand, infer from the passage a variety of revelations of the future made to Abraham, Gen.

It passes lightly over the destruction of Sodom, pausing only long enough to denounce Lot and his daughters for their incest, the result of which is the commandment, engraven in the heavenly tablets, to root out their descendants on the day of condemnation.11® Of the long incident of Abimelech in Gen. 20, Jubilees retains only the bare statement of Abraham's moving to Gerar. The birth of Isaac is compressed from the account in Gen. 21.21. In being circumcised, Isaac was the first for whom the commandment was properly observed.120 Even before Isaac was born, the "angel of the Presence" appeared to Abraham to reveal to him that he would be the father of six more sons121 but that the descendants of all these would be Gentiles, while the offspring of Isaac would be a holy seed: a kingdom, and priests and a holy nation.122 In joy at the announcement, Abra ham celebrated sukkot, for a period of seven days.123 He and his household observed the festival, and there was neither a stranger nor an uncircumcised person with them. Abraham celebrated the festival, as the heavenly tablets ordained, in its due season. It is a festival eternally to be observed.124 The account of the banishing of Hagar and Ishmael is rather close to the biblical account.125 When Ishmael grows up, his "י Jub. XVI, 8-9. The predominating rabbinic view is one of condemna tion of the daughters. Josephus, Ant. I, XI, 5 and a comment in Gen.

The manner of celebration departs in some details, in the number of animals sacrificed, from the rules in Num. 29.12-40. 123 The observance is in part paraphrased from Lev. 23.33-44. Jubilees omits mention of the shabbaton (Lev. 23.39) on the eighth day. The biblical account mentions neither the wreaths of Jub. XVI, 30, which Charles, op. cit., II, 39, says is peculiar to Jubilees, nor the morning haqapot of Jub. XVI, 31. 125 Jub. XVII. There are a few minor additions and alterations. Sarah resents Abraham's joy at Ishmael's "playing," Jub.

A heavenly scene introduces the events of the binding of Isaac, Gen. 22. Mastema suggests to God that He try Abraham by commanding him to offer Isaac as a sacrifice.128 God replies that Abraham has successfully withstood all the previous trials129 and in everything he had been found faithful; his soul had not been impatient and he had been slow to act, for he was faithful and a lover of God.130 The story of the Binding is quite close to מצחק of MT was read differently, and probably was more, originally, than this one laconic word. The rabbis infer idolatry from the word, Tar. Jon. ad loc. Elsewhere, Ishmael's playfulness is specified as his shooting arrows at Isaac, Tos.Tos. Sotah, VI. The ש־הים of Gen. 21.15 becomes an olive tree in Jub. XVII, 10. 126 Tar. Jon. Gen. 21.21, names her Fatima. As Ginzberg V, 247 points out, PRE XXX gives the two wives of Ishmael, in rabbinic tradition, the names of Aisha and Fatima, names borne by Mohamed's wife and daughter. Gen. 25.13. It seems strange that the author of Jubilees should mention only this one son of Ishmael by name, and to do so in apparently turning from his context in Gen. 21 to Gen. 25. Perhaps the reason lies in the contemporane ous importance of the Nabateans. I am at a loss to explain the etymology which Jubilees provides for the name. See, also, below, page 192, note 320 on Ant. I, XII, 4. "8 The story is paralleled in general in Sanhedrin 89b. Some details there differ: it is Satan rather than Mastema; it is asserted that Abraham had enjoyed everything without ever offering even a turtle-dove or pigeon. This version is unacquainted with, or else rejects, the view of Jubilees that Abraham had offered sacrifices. "&gt; At this point the author enumerates six trials. The "Binding" would be a seventh. In Jub. XIX, 8, the death of Sarah is listed as Abraham's tenth trial. The rabbis speak frequently of ten trials, though the list varies from passage to passage, Abot V, 2 and elsewhere. See below, page 208 and Ginzberg, V, 218. "ג' Jub. XVII, 15-18. The epithet "lover of God," or "friend of God," Jub.

Philo presents this problem, that he cites the verse twice, adding to MT in one case Sob. 56 the epithet "friend of God," and in the other case, LA III, 27 "servant of God." MT gives a basis for the epithet in II Chron. 20.7, and Isa. 41.8, but in each of these cases we encounter not φιΧοθίός but the verb ή~/άπησα. φιλοθίός then, is wanting in LXX.</page><page sequence="16">166 SAMUEL SANDMEL [16] the account in Gen. 22. The two young men131 are left, consider ately, near a well of water.132 Where Gen. 22.9 reads "they arrived at the place which God had told him," Jubilees XVIII, 7 reads "he drew near the mount of God."133 The angel of the Presence and Mastema stand in the presence of God at the crucial moment; God instructs the angel to call to Abraham and to prevent the slaughter.134 The date of the event is apparently Passover.135 Jubilees XIX, 1-9 compresses the narrative of the death of Sarah and the purchase of the double cave.136 The death of Sarah is called Abraham's tenth trial.137 Jubilees XIX, 9 records that Abraham did not claim the plot as he might have done as part of the divine promise, but begged for a place.138 Where then did Philo and James get the epithet? Ryle, Philo and Holy Scrip ture,ture, 1895, 74-75, conjectures that a now lost version of the LXX contained the epithet; the phrase "servant of God" would be a deliberate substitution in the interest of avoiding undue familiarity. Ryle's explanation may be well founded, but it does not indicate how any epithet either came into the verse, or coming in, was eliminated in the extant LXX. That both Tar. Jer. and Philo read a longer verse than is now found in both MT and LXX may point to a scribal omission from MT, and that the LXX was later corrected to the short version of the verse. But this is, by and large, unrewarding conjecture. MT gives adequate basis for the epithet; and while LXX lacks the exact epithet, the idea is clearly expressed. It is, accordingly, not surprising that the epithet is found in Philo and in James. Cf. Ginzberg, V, 207-208. 131 Gen. 22.5. 132 Jubilees XVIII, 4. 133 Verse 13 identifies the hill as Mount Zion. This identification is bib lical in basis, II Chron. 3.1. Josephus and the rabbis also make the identifica tion; see Ant. I, XIII, 2; Gen. R. XLV and Sifre Deut. XVIII. 134 Jub. XVIII, 10. Verse 12 mentions the ram, but says nothing about the atoning power of the horn for later generations, a motif frequent among the rabbis. Jub. XVIII, 16 inserts "Go in peace," possibly from I Sam. 1.17. 135 Jubilees does not here mention Passover by name. Earlier, the calling of Abraham is allocated to the 12th day of the first month; three days later would make it the fourteenth or fifteenth of the month, Nisan. I do not find any similar view in rabbinic literature. This depiction of Abraham observing the offering of a sort of paschal sacrifice would complete the list of the festivals which Jubilees is asserting that Abraham observed. Jubilees assigns the length of the festival to the seven days occupied by Abraham's going and coming, Jub. XIX, 18-19. 136 Ephron is not mentioned at all. 137 Jub. XIX, 8.

The remainder of the Genesis material is found as follows: Gen. 25.5-6, the giving of gifts to the children;'41 and the death'42 of Abraham greatly elaborated.'43 Reverting now to the material which is not a paraphrase of Genesis but free in composition, Abraham was still alive at the birth of Jacob and Esau.'44 Abraham observed the deeds of Abraham's humility in offering to buy this land already virtually his by the divine promise. ־"Jub. XIX, 10. 140 Jub. XIX, 11. The verse states that Hagar had died before Sarah; Charles op. cit., II, 41, interprets the statement to be an explanation of why Abraham did not take Hagar back. Tar. Jer. Gen. 25.1 and PRE XXX, however, aver that Hagar and Keturah were the same person; in marrying Keturah the rabbinic Abraham was taking Hagar back. 141 Gen. 25.6, says only that Abraham sent these children eastward. Jub. XX, 11 tells that the sons of Ishmael and the sons of Keturah went together and dwelt "from Paran to the entrance into Babylon in the land towards the east facing the desert." These mingled with each other and their name was called Arabs and Ishmaelites. 142 Gen. 25.7-10. 144 Jub. XXIII, 1-8. The death of Abraham occurs immediately after he gives a blessing to Jacob, with Jacob lying asleep in his bosom. Jacob wakes, realizes Abraham is dead, and runs and tells Rebekkah. She goes to Isaac, in the night, and tells him. The three go together, Jacob bearing a lamp. Isaac falls on the face of his father and kisses him. The sound of their wailing reaches to the home of Abraham where Ishmael, hearing the sound, immedi ately goes to Abraham and joins in the weeping. The lamentation over Abra ham lasts for forty days. The mourning is participated in by the household and the sons of Keturah. From Noah on the life-span had become shorter and men had grown old quickly because of wickedness, but Abraham had a fullness of days. I have found no rabbinic parallels to these additions, though the decrease in the span of life is mentioned in Josephus, Ant. I, VI, 5. 144 Jub. XIX, 13.

He commands them to observe the way of the Lord, to work righteousness and love each his neighbor, and to do justice and righteousness in the land. They should circumcise their sons, and refrain from fornication and uncleanness, lest they meet the fate of the Sodomites.150 He charges them not to worship idols and not to make graven images, for these are useless, but to worship God, the source of blessings.151 Some five years later152 Abraham speaks to Isaac. He is aware, he tells him, of his approaching death, since he is now 175 years old. All his life he has hated idols and those who worship them.

The details of the sacrificial procedures are enumerated.154 These details are written in the books of the forefathers,"55 Shem and Noah.

By doing the will of God Isaac will receive a blessing from God, and neither Abraham's name nor his name will be forgotten in the earth."60 The same year Isaac and Ishmael come to Abraham at Beer-Sheba to observe Shabuot. Isaac had many possessions at Beer-Sheba, and he used to go there both to see these and to visit his father. Abraham rejoices to have his two sons together. Isaac offers a burnt offering and a thanks offering; Rebekkah has made new cakes of the new grain and given them to Jacob to take to his grandfather; she has sent, also, some first fruits, that Abraham might bless these before his death. Abraham eats and drinks and blesses God, thanking Him for being able to see that day. He then prays that God's mercy and peace may rest on him and on his descendants and that these may be a chosen nation.

Jacob is enjoined not to eat with Gentiles but to separate himself from them, and not to be associated in their works which are unclean. Gentiles offer sacrifices to the dead and worship evil spirits, and they eat over graves. They have no true understanding for they worship idols. Jacob must not take a wife from among the Canaanites. Jacob is charged to perpetuate the house of Abraham.161 Isaac conveys to Jacob the blessing given to Abraham and to to him.162 Another dozen or so scattered allusions to Abraham, of no special significance, are to be found in Jubilees. Two, however, might be mentioned. Joseph rejects the offer of Potiphar's wife because Abraham has prohibited fornication;163 Judah's wish to have Tamar burnt for being a prostitute, accorded with the judgment of Abraham.164 The Abraham portrayed in Jubilees is greatly concerned with the encroaching Hellenism of the period in which the book was written. There is the ever-present enticement of idolatry. Gen tiles are in the immediate vicinity, and it is necessary that one should not eat with them and surely not intermarry with them. The way of the Gentiles is an abomination, and the imitation of their practices can lead to sharing in the abomination. Indeed, some disloyal Jews follow the Gentiles and abstain from circum cision. The remedy for avoiding their contamination is a rigid separation from them, and the strictest kind of adherence to the ancient laws of ritual purity, which are to be found in the Mosaic Law of ritual observance. Abraham observed and en joined the Mosaic Law. He observed the three festivals joy fully. Moreover, Abraham learned Hebrew and transcribed the ancient books. He is the model for those who would stand firm against the temptation of the Greeks. 161 Jub. XXII, especially v. 24. 162 Jub. XXVI, 23-24 is a paraphrase of Gen. 27.27-29.

It provides a series of legends centering mostly on Abraham's career before his migration from home. As Pseudo-Philo relates the story, Abraham was one of twelve who refused to obey the command of Nimrod to build the Tower of Babel. The other eleven fled to the hills. The populace, angry at Abraham, cast him into the furnace along with the bricks. An earthquake, brought on by God, caused the fire in the furnace to consume all those near-by, to the number of 83,500. Abraham was unhurt; he summoned the other eleven to return in safety.165 The Tower was nevertheless built. God therefore determined to scatter the people, but he chose Abraham from their midst, and led him to the land selected before the flood and not de stroyed by it. The language of the people was confused and the people were scattered.166 The Apocalypse of Abraham, as its title indicates, presents a rather typical apocalypse centered around Abraham and de veloped by embellishments of Gen. 15.167 Abraham and an angel, Joel, ride to heaven on the wings of the pigeon and the turtle dove of Gen. 15.9. Abraham has revealed to him not only the various sights of the seven heavens, of Hell and the Garden of Eden, but he sees the history of the past and the unfolding of the future. His vision includes the punishment of the heathens who oppress Israel; the woes of the premessianic times; and then the Elect One who, when God sounds the trumpet, gathers Israel from among the peoples. At that time those who stood 165 Antiquities of Philo, VI, 3-18. 166 Ibid., VII, 1-5. Pseudo-Philo then seems to lose interest in Abraham, telescoping a few other matters into a very brief account. He mentions the marriage with Hagar, the birth of Ishmael and the twelve sons of Ishmael, Lot's dwelling in Sodom; God's appearance to Abraham and the promise that his seed would inherit the land. The Abraham section concludes with the birth of Isaac. Only the legend given above is dwelled on. Cf. Antiquities of Philo, VI-VIII.VI-VIII. '6י The apocalypse is Part Two of the book. Part One is still another legend of the youth of Abraham and of his merry adventures with the idols of his father, Terah, not unlike the legend summarized above, note 86.</page><page sequence="22">172 SAMUEL SANDMEL [22] firm will rejoice over the downfall of those who have turned to idols.168 The interest in the book is in the revelation to Abraham, and not in Abraham himself. The central character could just as readily have been Moses or Isaac. The Testament of Abraham, probably an earlier book,169 is an expansion in the haggadic manner of the foretaste of the world to come which Abraham enjoyed before his death. Michael is despatched to gather in Abraham's soul, but Abraham declines to give it up. He is permitted to ride in the heavenly chariot and to look down on the earth beneath. The trip has to be interrupted, because Abraham commands Michael to destroy sinners. God rebukes Abraham, for God prefers that the sinner repent and live. Accordingly, Abraham is taken to the gate of Paradise to see what happens to souls at death. A narrow gate is prepared for the just, and Abraham fears that his bodily stature is too large for the entrance, but God assures him that he may enter unhindered, as may those who are like Abraham. A wide door is available for those who are not just. Recording angels scan the written accounts of a man's deeds in an enormous book, and they weigh the man in the balance. Those whose good overbalances the evil enter into Paradise; the others go into Gehenna. Abraham is confronted with the instance of a man who required only one more meritorious deed to qualify him for Paradise. Abraham intercedes for the man and he is allowed to enter Paradise. Restored to earth, Abraham again refuses to surrender his soul. The angel of death appears to him in the guise of a young and beautiful angel, but Abraham discerns his true appearance. Indeed, a glimpse of the angel as he actually is brings death to seven thousand of Abraham's slaves; these are restored to life, however, by Abraham's prayers. Abraham's passing takes place in a dream. Michael and a 168 Cf. Box, The Apocalypse of Abraham, 1918, and Ginzberg in JE, I, 91-92, "Abraham, Apocalypse of."

His body is laid to rest at Mamre three days later, but Abraham's soul is taken to Paradise to the abode prepared for him, for Isaac, and for Jacob. In this abode there are no traces of trouble or grief or sighing, but only peace, rejoicing, and eternal life. Two hellenistic Jewish fragments agree that Abraham lived in Babylon. One account summarizes his early career by telling that his genealogy goes back to the giants there. All of these were destroyed by God for their impiety except Belos; he built a tower and dwelled in it, and the tower was named after him. Abraham learned astrology; first he went to Phoenicia and taught it to the Phoenicians, and then he went to Egypt.170 A longer account, from a writer whom Eusebifis calls Eupo lemos,171 begins with the founding of the city of Babylon by the giants who are saved from the flood and who live in the well-known tower. After the tower fell through the action of God, the giants were scattered throughout the whole earth. In the tenth generation, it is said, in the city of Kamarine of Baby Ion, Abraham was born.172 Others call the city 0vpnjs.173 Abra ham surpassed all men in the nobility of his birth and wisdom. 170 Eusebius, Praep. Ev. IX, 18. Freudenthal, Hellenistische Studien, I, 82-89, believes that this "anonymous" fragment is in reality an excerpt from or an abbreviation of Pseudo-Eupolemos, but that it became confused in Alexander Polyhistor's hands and that he failed to recognize it for the excerpt that it is. 171 Freudenthal, I, 82-89, shows that this author and another Eupolemos are two different people. Our present author is, as will be seen, a Samaritan; the other Eupolemos is a Jew. The present author is therefore called Pseudo Eupolemos by Freudenthal; so, too, Stearns, Fragments from Graeco-Jewish Writers,Writers, 67. 172 The text first ascribes his birth to the tenth generation, and promptly states that it was in the thirteenth.

At God's command he went to Phoenicia to settle ; there he taught the Phoenicians the movements of the sun and the moon and all other things. He pleased their monarch greatly.174 Later the Armenians made war on the Phoenicians,175 and in their conquest they captured his nephew. Abraham and his household came to the rescue, and there ensued a deliverance of the captives and a capture of the children and wives of the enemy. The oldest176 (of those released) suggested that Abraham keep the property but release the people. Abraham, however, did not choose to take advantage of the unfortunate. He ac cepted the repayment of the food of his young men, but restored the spoils. Then he settled near Argarizin,177 which translated means "mountain of the lofty."178 He received gifts179 from Melchizedek, the priest of God and king. When a famine broke out, Abraham moved to Egypt with all his household and dwelled there. The Egyptian king married his wife, Abraham saying that she was his sister. The king was not able to consort with her because his people and his house hold were stricken with disease. Priests, summoned, told him that the woman was not unmarried.180 The king restored her to Abraham when the priests revealed that she was Abraham's wife. Abraham dwelled in Heliopolis among the priests, and he taught them many things, astrology and other matters. He explained to them that the Babylonians had founded these studies, and that they went back to Enoch, who discovered them, not the Egyptians. The Babylonians say that first there 174 This is unique to Pseudo-Eupolemos. 175 Pseudo-Eupolemos relates the events of Gen. 14 as though they oc curred prior to the events of Gen. 12.10-20. 176 In Gen. 14.21, it is the king of Sodom. 177 Mount Gerizim.

His children were Belus and Cham.181 The latter begat Canaan, the father of the Phoenicians, and Chous182 whom the Greeks call Asbolos, the father of the Ethiopians, and the brother of Mestraeim,183 the father of the Egyptians. The Greeks say that Atlas discovered astrology. Atlas and Enoch are the same person. Enoch's son was Methu selah who learned everything through angels of God and who taught that to us.184 A third fragment, of Artapanus, derives the name "Hebrews" from Abraham.185 Abraham went with all his household to Pharethothes the king of the Egyptians, and taught him astrology. He remained there twenty186 years and then returned to Syria. Many of those who went with him remained in Egypt because of the prosperity of the land.187 A fourth fragment, by Demetrios, gives a brief summary of the events of Gen. 22. It is so abridged that it is of no significance for our study beyond the fact that it shows that Demetrios retold the incident.188 The fifth fragment comes from a prophet Cleodemus who is also known as Malchus•18' Josephus cites from Cleodemus in support of the Mosaic contention that descendants of Abraham by Keturah occupied Lybia and that Africa is named after one of them. Cleodemus mentions three of the sons who gave their 181 Ham, the son of Noah. 182 Gen. 10.6. 188 Ibid. 184 Eus., Praep.

Heracles married the daughter of Apheras and begot a son Diodorus, who in turn begot a son Sophon ; from Sophon comes the name Sophakes by which barbarians are called.'93 The outstanding note of the mention of Abraham in the fragments of Graeco-Jewish writers is the apologetic. Abraham's native place is identified as Babylon, probably because it was a more definite allocation than Ur or Chaldea. His superiority over others is described in terms of his high birth and wisdom; it is averred that his piety pleased God. It accords with the rabbis that Abraham knew astrology. The rabbis, however, do not, as do the Greek writers, depict Abraham as teaching astrology to the other peoples.'94 He even teaches astrology to the king of Egypt and to the Egyptian priests. Neither the Egyptians nor the Greeks discovered as trology; Enoch, whom the Greeks call Atlas, was the true discoverer. Without the mediation of Abraham, the Egyptians would not have known the science.'95 Against the implication 190 Ashurim,, Gen. 25.3. 191 The identification with the particular biblical son is uncertain. Gen. 25.4, mentioned Efah and Efer. 192 Freudenthal I, 133-135, identifies Heracles as a Phoenician God, and not as the son of Jupiter and Alcmene. 193 It is to be recalled that in I Maccabees XII, 10 and 21, and II Macca bees V, 9, the Spartans and the Lacedaemonians are held to be of the yévos of Abraham. 19י That two of the sources portay Abraham as teaching the Phoenicians is regarded by Freudenthal I, 96-97, as supporting evidence for the view that the author (or authors) are Samaritans, on the basis that the Phoenicians were regarded by the Samaritans as kin, Ant. XI, VIII, 6 and XII, V, 5. That Pseudo-Eupolemos, almost certainly and Cleodemus, probably, were Samar itans does not materially affect the conception of Abraham, though the fact colors the writings perceptibly; Samaritans shared the necessity for apologetic explanations that Jews felt, and the apologetic message took the same form of pride in the antiquity of the tradition and a claim for the true priority in publicly approved endeavors. 193 Nor, in the view of Josephus, Ant.

It is impossible to know, because of the scantiness of material preserved, whether certain of the Biblical episodes, such as circumcision and the covenant of Gen. 15, were deliberately omitted by the authors, or omitted circumstantially by Alex ander, or by those who read him. It is useless to speculate on the point. What material on Abraham is preserved, however, is almost entirely apologetic in purpose. Even the interest in the extraction of related peoples is apologetic in intent, as demonstrating the pre-eminence of Abraham both with respect to his antiquity and with respect to the achievements of his various descendants. The writers appear to be enhancing their own origin by pointing to the common extraction of other ancient and eminent peoples. Insofar as one can see, there are no specifically "Jewish" qualities to Abraham; as presented he is quite intelligible to Greeks. As the progenitor of the Jews, he is their property, but his signih cance extends beyond the Jews; his achievements benefit other peoples. The mentions of Abraham are few in Fourth Maccabees. The book illustrates, through the story of Hannah and her seven sons, the power of βύσββής λογισμό?, pious reason, to control the passions and to produce in the individual the four cardinal virtues, φρόνησα, δικαιοσύνη, ανδράa and σωφρο σννη.σννη.

The Law could be obeyed on the ground that its philosophy would show that it accorded with reason; but the true basis for obedience to it is that it is a divine Law. The Law is the prescription for the conquest of the passions and for obtaining the cardinal virtues. The primary illustration of the thesis that the Law leads to the conquest of the passions is the narrative of the events of the Maccabean revolt. The author, however, turns to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as proof of his contentions. He has illustrated how the priest Eleazer, trained in the knowledge of the Law and eminent in philosophy206 has through pious reason conquered together. I follow here R. B.

Those alone who make piety their primary thought with the whole heart are able to control the passions of the flesh. Such faithful people do not die to God but live to Him, as was the case with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not a contradiction that some people, through the weakness of their reason, succumb to their passions. But if a person follows the whole rule of philosophy piously and trusts in God, through his piety he does conquer his passions.208 Hannah, like Abraham, was not moved from her purpose by the passion of love for her children.20' Her choice of death for her sons called to mind the reverential courage of Abraham whose true daughter she was.210 She urged her sons to be true to God and to endure all pain for His sake, as Abraham hastened to sacrifice Isaac, and as Isaac did not shrink when he saw the knife in his father's hand.211 The sons, too, knew that men who die for God live to God, as do Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.212 The majesty of her action is the greater in that her sons were descendants of Abraham.213 Hannah and her sons were gathered to the place of the an cestors, having received pure and immortal souls.214 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive to receive and praise those who die for the keeping of the Law.215 A true son of Abraham endures torture without flinching.216 Children born of the seed of Abraham obey the Law.217 Sons of Abraham cannot play counterfeit parts. They live by the truth, even to old age, and, as sons of Abraham, they must be ready to die nobly for the sake of the Law.218 3°' Ibid. VI, 30. 308 Ibid. VII, 17-22. 30» Ibid. XIV, 13-20. 310 Ibid.

He is the model after whom the protagonists of the narrative fashion their own actions. The things that they do are the things which Abraham before them did. This achievement is not directly stated as observance of the Law; the illustrations derived from Abraham are his un swerving purpose, his reverential courage, and his obedience. That pious reason in controlling the passions leads to the cardinal virtues is true of the actions of Abraham and true also of the Law; but this equation, though implicit, is our own and not explicitly that of the author. Josephus introduces Abraham with a statement about his forebears; and he adds that Abram was the tenth generation from Noah.219 He tells how many years after the flood the birth of Abraham takes place.220 Terah is seventy when Abraham is born. Abram has two brothers, Nahor and Haran. Haran left a son, Lot, and two daughters, Sarah and Milcan.221 Abraham marries Sarah and Nahor marries Milcan. Haran has died in Ur of the Chaldees, where his sepulchre is still to be seen. Terah has come to hate Chaldea because of Haran's death there.222 Josephus comments, about the age of Terah at his death 219 So, too, Abot, V, 2. 220 The mss. disagree. Most of them read 993 years, apparently the true reading; others read 292 years, apparently a correction to accord with MT; the LXX yields 1072 years. Cf. Weill, Oeuvres completes de F. Josèphe, I, 34. 221 Sarah is thus Abraham's niece. The rabbis similarly identify Iscah, Gen. 11.29, with Sarah, Meg. 14a: Iscah means "seer" and the name proves that Sarah was a prophet. The statements conflict with Gen. 20.12, which identifies Sarah as the half-sister of Abraham. 222 Josephus seems to indicate that he has fuller information which he is not supplying. Perhaps Josephus knows the legends of Abraham's youth, which involve Haran, either in the form of Jubilees, in which Haran perishes in trying to save some idols from the fire, Jub. XII, 14; or in the rabbinic form of Haran's being cast into the fiery furnace from which Abraham was rescued, Tar.Tar. Jon. to Gen. 11.28. The motive ascribed here for the departure is peculiar to Josephus. For other views see Judith, V, 9 and the stories of Nimrod and Abraham as reproduced in Ginzberg, I, 185-203. Philo assumed that the call of Gen. 12 comes in Ur; he makes no allusion in De Abrahamo to the events of</page><page sequence="31">[31] PHILO' S PLACE IN JUDAISM 181 in Haran in Mesopotamia223 at 205 years, that the decrease in the ages of the patriarchs had now begun, and reached the norm of 120 as in the case of Moses.224 Josephus adds a genealogy to show the descent of Rebekkah.225 Abram adopts226 Lot since he has no legitimate son, and he takes Lot and Sarah to Canaan. Josephus ascribes his migration to a divine command, but he reproduces almost none of the contents of Gen. 12.1-3. Abraham is a man of ready intelligence in all matters, persuasive with his hearers, and infallible in his conclusions. He has begun to have conceptions of virtue loftier than those of the rest of mankind, and has determined to change and improve the ideas current concerning God. He first has dared to proclaim God one, and to declare that if any other thing227 helped a man's welfare, this was due to God's command and not to any inherent capacity in itself. Abraham has made this inference from the irregularity in the movements of the heavenly bodies, the irregularity proving that these are subject to a higher power.228 These opinions have roused the Chaldeans Gen. 11.26-32. The difference seems to be that Josephus indicates a knowledge of legends about Abraham's youth; Philo gives no indication of such knowledge. 22ג Mesopotamia is not mentioned at this place in MT or LXX. I take it to be a place-name which would be known to Greeks. 224 Cf. Gen. 6.2 and Deut. 34.7. The rabbis, too, associate the age of Moses with Gen. 6.2, Gen. R. XXVI. The notion that the age span had begun to diminish is found also in Jub. XXIII, 9; see above, note 143. "5 Ant. I, VI, 5. 226 Peculiar to Josephus, the term seems selected for Greek readers. 227 I prefer to render tl by "thing" rather than Thackeray's "being," IV, 77. 228 The notion that Abraham arrived at the knowledge of the existence of God by celestial observations is found both in Jub. XII, 17 and among the Rabbis, Gen. R. XXXIX. Peculiar to Josephus is the notion that this inference stemmed from the irregularity of the heavenly movements. Philo's view is significantly different from Josephus'; Philo scorns astronomical observation as a possible means of inferring the existence of God, and he portrays Abraham as abandoning this kind of foolishness in favor of learning the existence of God by an analogy: just as there exists a mind in man so must there be a mind in the universe, Abr. 71 ff. Josephus, the rabbis, Jubilees, and Philo, unite in portraying Abraham as diverging from the beliefs of his environment, and they unite in deriding the worship of celestial objects as deities. But the manner of Abraham's divergence seems to portray a range: The rabbis simply assert</page><page sequence="32">182 SAMUEL SANDMEL [32] and the other Mesopotamians against him, so that Abraham, with the will and help of God, determines to emigrate, and he settles in Canaan.229 Josephus adds to the statement of Gen. 12.8, which depicts Abraham as only building an altar, the statement that he offered a sacrifice.230 Josephus then turns to two historians, Berosus and Nicolas of Damascus, for proof that Abraham is a well-known person.231 Next Josephus recounts the sojourn in Egypt. Josephus adds to the Biblical account that Abraham hears of the prosperity of the Egyptians.232 He has a motive in addition to obtaining food. He wants to visit the priests and hear their discourses about the gods; he intends either to be convinced by their superior doctrine or else to convert them to his own better doctrine.233 As Josephus tells the story, Abraham knows of the Egyptians' Egyptians' frenzy for women234 and it is for this reason and in view of Sarah's beauty, that he fears for his life and pretends to be her brother. Pharaoh is not satisfied with the reports he hears about her, but he wants both to see her and to lay hands on her.235 God thwarts this criminal passion by an outbreak of disease236 that Abraham saw something anterior to celestial objects; Josephus gives an attempted explanation of what it was that Abraham observed; Philo denies the assertion of both Josephus and the rabbis in favor of an entirely different process. See below, note 48. 22י The enmity of the Chaldeans was noted above. Josephus assumes that the call to migrate came in Haran, while Philo (Abr. 61-67) and the rabbis take it to have come in Ur, possibly under the influence of Gen. 15.7 and Neh. 9.7. "0Ant."0Ant. I, VII, I. Jubilees XIII, 9 also records that Abraham offered a sacrifice; they interpret Gen. 12.8 "and he called in the name of God" to mean that he prayed, Tar. Onk. and Tar. Jon. ad loc. ; or that he made con verts, Gen. R. XXXIX. The rabbis portray Satan as charging Abraham with not having offered any sacrifices, and therefore he should be tested with Isaac, San.San. 89b. The verse does not appear at all in Philo in the works which have survived; it is apparently deliberately ignored as foreign to Philo's purpose in De De Abrahamo. 231"י On these historians, cf. Weill, I, 37. 232 So, too, Tan. Lek, VIII. 235 This is peculiar to Josephus. 234 So, too, Tan. Lek, VIII. 233 Josephus makes no mention of Sarah's being taken to Pharaoh's palace. Philo portrays Pharaoh as sending for Sarah, Abr. 94. 236 Gen. 12.17.</page><page sequence="33">[33] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 183 and by political disturbance.237 Pharaoh vainly offers sacrifices; his priests inform him that the plagues are due to his wish to outrage the stranger's wife.238 Pharaoh confirms the truth of the relationship by questioning Sarah.23» He apologizes to Abra ham and gives him abundant riches.240 Abraham consorts with the most learned of the Egyptians, and as a result, the fame of his virtue and reputation becomes still more conspicuous.241 Josephus explains how Abraham gained his fame. The Egyptians have a variety of customs and opinions, and factions are always differing with others and disparaging them. Abraham confers with each party, proving that its view has nothing true in it. The Egyptians admire him not only for his intelligence but for his powers of persuasion. He introduces them to arith metic and transmits to them the laws of astronomy,242 of which sciences the Egyptians had been ignorant. The knowledge which Abraham had brought from Chaldea then spread to the Greeks.243 Josephus abridges the events of Gen. 13, omitting entirely the divine promises of the land, 14-17. The mention of Hebron (Νά/3ρο) leads Josephus to comment that its age is greater than that of Tanis in Egypt by seven years.244 2·" The political disturbance is peculiar to Josephus. 248 Priests reveal the true relationship also in a fragment by Pseudo Eupolemus, in Eusebius, Praep. Εν. IX, 17. 24' This is peculiar to Josephus. 24» The scriptural account makes the giving of gifts follow the "abduction" of Sarah and precede the plague. 241 24η/. I, VIII, 1. 242 Artapanus, in Eusebius, Praep. Εν. IX, 18, portrays Abraham as teaching astrology to Pharaoh. Rappaport, Agada und Exegese bei Fiavius Josephus,Josephus, believes that legends depicting Abraham disputing with Nimrod or with proselytes, lie behind this passage (pages 16-17, an(' notes #85 and #86 on pages 102 and 103); this seems barely possible, but hardly persuasive. 244 Ant. I, VIII, 2. 244 Jub. XIII, 12 similarly cites this information at this place, apparently from Num. 13.22. It seems to be more than coincidence that both make this somewhat unexpected citation in exactly the same context. The Syriac, Gen. 13.10 reads Tanis. Tanis is צען while the city found in our present text is MT צער, LXX Ζόγορα. In context, Gen. 13.10, the name of an Egyptian city is more to be expected as descriptive of the "garden of Egypt" than the men tion of this Sodomite city. That the LXX also reads צער would tend to show that the replacement of the Egyptian city by the Sodomite one, through an</page><page sequence="34">184 SAMUEL SANDMEL [34] Josephus next turns to the wars of the kings of Gen. 14. He summarizes the four kings as the Assyrians,245 but does not mention them by name. The conquest by the four kings (implied in Gen. 14.4, but not explicitly stated), as he describes it, is achieved through a siege of Sodom by the Assyrians who have divided their army into four bodies, with one general in command of each. The victorious Assyrians impose tribute on the Sodomites who pay for twelve years and then rebel. An army of the As Syrians proceeds against them. Josephus then lists as command ing generals the men mentioned as kings in Gen. 14.1. These ravage the whole of Syria246 and they subdue the descendants of the giants.247 The Assyrians encamp in the bitumen pits which existed before the destruction of Sodom and the con version of the valley into the Asphalt lake. There a battle is joined; it is a stubborn contest.248 Many are killed and others taken prisoners, among them Lot, who has come to fight as an ally of the Sodomites.249 When Abraham hears of the disaster, he is moved alike with fear for his kinsman, Lot, and with compassion for his friends and neighbors, the Sodomites.250 He sets out immediately, and on the fifth night251 he falls upon the Assyrians in the neighbor easy scribal error, is quite early. Possibly in the days of the composition of Jubilees, a still fluid text read צען. By the time of Josephus, however, the text seems to have been fixed; Onkelos and LXX both read צער. The mention of Tanis in Josephus rests either on a now lost version of the Bible, or on some secondary source, probably Jubilees. 2« Again he seems to use a geographical name more easily to be identified by his Greek readers. 26יי This is derived from Gen. 14.5-8. 2י" "Descendants" is added by Josephus. "Giants" is the reading of LXX. 248 Added by Josephus, possibly to glorify Abraham's exploits in con quering the Assyrians. 249 Ant. I, IX. This last is peculiar to Josephus; Gen. 19 portrays Lot as dwelling right in Sodom. Josephus omits the fugitives to the mountains Gen. 14.10 and the refugee of 13. 250 This evaluation of the Sodomites is peculiar to Josephus, and at wide variance with the rabbinic view of the unneighborliness of the Sodomites. Its purpose is to aggrandize Abraham. 251 This is added by Josephus. Possibly it stems from an estimate of the time required for an army to move from Hebron to Dan in northern Palestine.</page><page sequence="35">[35] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 185 hood of Dan — the name, Josephus adds, of one of the two sources of the Jordan.2:2 It is a surprise attack; some Assyrians are slain in their beds, asleep; some awake before they can arm themselves; and others, though awake, are incapable of fighting through drunkenness, but these manage to flee.253 The victory proves that triumph does not depend on numbers but on the ardor and the mettle of the combatants.254 The incident of Melchizedek then follows. His name means "righteous king."255 For this reason he was made the priest of God.256 Salem was afterwards called Jerusalem.z57a The wine and bread are changed into a "hospitable entertainment" in the midst of an "abundant providing."25713 The king of Sodom encourages Abraham to keep the spoil.258 Abraham declines for himself, but accepts portions for his servants and for his three friends, Eshkol, Aner, and Mamre.259 232 The river gets its name, say the rabbis, because it descends (yored) from Dan, Bekorot 55a. 233 Thackeray IV, 88, alludes to Philo's Abr. 233 as a striking parallel. The differences are just as striking. Philo says nothing of drunkenness and nothing of fugitives fleeing to Damascus; Josephus says nothing of Philo's insistence that Abraham's trust was not in his small force but in God. Both Josephus and Philo are giving naturalistic explanations of "divided the night" of Gen. 14.15, which the rabbis in their way interpret extravagantly. I see no signs here of dependency on Philo. 254 While this view would probably evoke the approval of military men, the rabbis and Philo see in the episode the proof that man, when aided by God, can triumph, and they would have regarded Josephus' comment as somewhat blasphemous. 253 So, too, Tar. Jon. to Gen. 14.18 and Hebrews VII, 2. 256 Peculiar to Josephus. Rabbinic views, undoubtedly in opposition to the identification of Christ with Melchizedek as found in Hebrews, portray him as ultimately forfeiting his priesthood, Nedarim 32b. 237a So, too, the rabbis; the Targumim render Salem by Jerusalem. In Apologia Apologia VII, 67 and B. J. VI, 438 Josephus accepts the etymology which makes Jerusalem a combination of the Greek itpos and the Hebrew Salem. A rabbinic view gives as the etymology the Hebrew yire', after Gen. 22.14 plus Salem; the two parts were combined for the name of Jerusalem, for to have omitted Salem would have been an injustice to Melchizedek, and to have omitted yire' would have offended Abraham, Gen. R. LVI. 237b Philo says that he "feasted them handsomely," Abr. 235. 238 Xeiav; MT rekush; LXX ϊππον. 259 Ant. I, X, 2. Josephus lists these in the order of the LXX rather than</page><page sequence="36">186 SAMUEL SANDMEL [36] Josephus next turns to the events of Gen. 15. Again he indicates that a sacrifice has been offered of the various ani mais.260 Before the altar could be erected261 birds of prey262 lusting for blood263 come flying to the scene.264 Josephus does not speak of an enslavement in a foreign land, but of future evil neighbors in Egypt; 265 the allusion may be to the anti-semitism of Alexandria which was pronounced at least in Josephus' earlier days. The chapter is abridged; Josephus makes no mention of the covenant of Gen. 15.18, nor of the tongue of fire and the smoke266 which pass through the pieces.267 As Josephus relates the events of Gen. 16, he portrays Abraham as dwelling near the oak of Ogyges, rather than Mamre.268 He beseeches God to grant him the birth of a male child.269 By God's command270 Sarah brings Hagar to his bed. This servant once pregnant, insolently abuses Sarah, assuming that the dominion will pass to her unborn son.271 Hagar, fleeing, MT. Philo, however, takes Mamre consistently as the name of a place, not a person, Mig. 164. 260 Jub.

LXX reads opvea birds, while MT reads עיט. 2י■" Not in Genesis. 264 Josephus omits the deep sleep which comes over Abraham, Gen. 15.12. Josephus puts into one sentence the coming of the birds of prey and the enslavement to Egypt. It may be conjectured that behind this juxtaposition may lie the interpretation of the 'ayit (Tar. Jon. and Tar. Jer. ad 10c.) as the four kingdoms destined to subject Israel. The conjecture rests only on what Josephus assembles for one sentence; there is no clear allusion, however. 265 Egypt is not mentioned in Gen. 15.13, which speaks only of "a land not theirs." 266 Gen. 15.17. 2" Ant.

He assures her that she will obtain a better state of affairs through prudence.272 Her present plight was due to her arrogance and presumptuousness.273 If she disobeys God and pursues her way, she will perish;274 but if she returns home she will become the mother of a son destined to rule over the country.275 Josephus adds to the biblical account not only that Hagar returns home, but that she is forgiven.276 Josephus omits in his recapitulation of Gen. 17 the change in name from Abram to Abraham and from Sarai to Sarah.277 The promise of the land, omitted in his account above of Gen. 15.18 appears now, though it is paraphrased as extending from Sidon to Egypt rather than from Egypt to the great river Euphrates.278 He gives a motive for circumcision, that Abraham's posterity may be kept from mixing with others.279 Josephus remarks that he will expound the reason for circumcision else where.280 Josephus does not mention the covenant notion of circumcision of Gen. 17.9-10.281 272 Gen. 16.9 simply tells her to "be afflicted"; the Targumim render this by "be enslaved" (Onk.), or by "be submissive," {Jon). 273 Peculiar to Josephus. 274 Peculiar to Josephus. 273 The last phrase, alluding to the wilderness, is peculiar to Josephus; it probably stems from his contemporaneous observation of Ishmaelites in the desert. 274 Ant.

The forgiveness is peculiar to Josephus. 277 Philo's great efforts to defend the addition of an alpha to Abraham's name suggest that Josephus deliberately suppressed the change so as not to be bothered with justifying it. See Mut. 66 ff. 278 Perhaps the alteration is influenced by the circumstance that the Jewish territory had not reached to the Euphrates, and Josephus is making the prediction accord to the geographical facts of his day. 279 This motive, as thus expressly stated, is lacking in the rabbinic writings. A rabbinic comment portrays Abraham as fearing that his circumcision may estrange prospective proselytes, Gen. R. XLVI; this is hardly a true parallel, for it expresses Abraham's fear that circumcision would be a barrier to con version rather than an intention to exclude. 280 Weill I, 45, appropriately comments that Josephus seems to distin guish between the purpose of circumcision and the rational or symbolic meaning of it. 281 Ant. I, X, 5.</page><page sequence="38">188 SAMUEL SANDMEL [38] The material in Gen. 18 and 19 is somewhat rearranged. Josephus begins with the transgression of the Sodomites, Gen. 18.20, and then introduces the contents of Gen. 18.1 ff. The Sodomites become overweeningly proud of their numbers and their wealth.282 They show themselves insolent to men and im pious to God.283 They forget the benefits they have received from God.284 They hate strangers and decline all intercourse with them.285 God determines to punish the Sodomites; he will not only uproot the city, but blast the land so completely that neither plant nor fruit will grow from that time forth.286 After God has decreed the doom of the Sodomites, Abraham, seated before the door of his courtyard,287 sees three angels whom he takes for strangers.288 Abraham offers them hospitality; they lead him to believe that they eat his food.289 The angels promise that they will return in the future290 and that they will find Sarah then already a mother. Sarah smiles291 and says that her advanced age and that of her husband preclude their having 282 Their rebelliousness stemmed from their abundant possessions, San. 109a. 283 So, too, Tar.

There may be added to this material the fact that one rabbinic comment implies that Abraham has two distinct visits; God appears to him, and the appearance is interrupted by the appearance of the three angels, Gen. R. XLVIII, but the usual view, ibid., and the Targumini ad ad loc., explain the vision of God as the vision of the three.

The angels come to Sodom where Lot invites them to be his guests, because he has learned hospitality from Abraham.2'4 The Sodomites see the angels as young men of very fair appearance,2'5 and they want to do violence and outrage to them. Lot offers them his daughters, but even this will not content them.2'6 God blinds the criminals2'7 so that they cannot find the door. He condemns the Sodomites to destruction. Lot, however, has been forewarned, so that he departs2'8 with his wife and two daughters, who are still virgins; their suitors2" scorn the notion 292 Scripture portrays God, not the men, as hearing the laughter, Gen. 18.13-14. 293 Ant. I, XI, 2. The rabbis treat the passage similarly. The identification is not only the same, but the rabbis go even further and give the name and precise missions of each of the three: Michael is to announce the tidings to Sarah; Raphael, to heal Abraham from his circumcision of three days before; and Gabriel to overturn Sodom, Β. M. 86b. This last comment is in conflict with Tar. Jon. and Tar. Jer. to Gen. 18.2, both of which insist that an angel can have but a single mission; it would therefore be impossible for Raphael to go on to Sodom; these passages do not name the three. The problem is "solved" in Gen. R. L. by substituting for the healing of Abraham the mission of Raphael to save Lot from Sodom. Josephus apparently bases the revelation of their nature to Abraham on Gen. 18.17, "Shall I conceal from Abraham what I am about to do?" I find no rabbinic parallel to Josephus' portrayal of the angels' identifying themselves. I doubt that any haggadah lies behind this added touch. 2,4 So, too, Tan. Wa-yera XI. The Rabbis draw a contrast, however, between Lot's stature and Abraham's. The angels promptly accept Abraham's offer, but Lot has to persuade them, Gen. R. L. 293 These additions probably stem from the portrayal, explicit in Scripture, of the Sodomites as homosexuals. 296 Ant. I, XI, 3. 297 Gen. 19.11 makes it the "men," not God, who blind the Sodomites; 29י Gen. 19.16 portrays the men as taking hold of the tarrying Lot and his family and bringing them out of the city. 299 Gen. 19.14 portrays Lot trying to persuade his "sons-in-law," LXX ·γαμβρούς who have "taken" his daughters. But above, verse seven, Lot has</page><page sequence="40">190 SAMUEL SANDMEL [40] of departure and they ridicule what Lot tells them. Josephus does not repeat the details of the destruction of Sodom, but refers the reader to his earlier account in the Jewish War.300 He remarks that he himself has seen the pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was changed.301 Lot flees to So'ar, where, isolated from mankind and in lack of food, he passes a miserable exist ence.302 Josephus ascribes the incest of the daughters of Lot to their desire to prevent the extinction of the race.303 The Ammonites and Moabites are still extant in Josephus' day.304 offered to the Sodomites his daughters who "have not known a man." Josephus escapes from this contradiction by altering the sons-in-law to suitors μνησ τη pes;τη pes; the daughters are, accordingly, still virgins. One rabbinic comment, Gen.Gen. R. L, by forced exegesis which interprets MT לקחי as a future, rather than לקוחי as a past, accords with this view of Josephus. The prevailing rabbinic solution, however, escapes from the contradiction by equipping Lot not with two daughters but with four, two of whom are married and two virgins. See Gen. R. XLIX: Abraham believes that there might be ten right eous in Sodom: Lot, his wife, four daughters and four sons-in-law; Gen. R. L, which states expressly that Lot had four daughters; and PRE XXV, which ascribes to Lot's wife her turning to look at Sodom out of solicitude for two of her daughters married to two Sodomites. 300 B. J. IV, 483-485; Josephus seemingly rejects the view that the Salt Sea covers Sodom. So, too, Philo, Abr. 141. 301 There is frequent mention in rabbinics that the pillar of salt still stands, PRE PRE XXV; cf. Rappaport, 105-106. Wisdom of Solomon X, 7 speaks of the pillar of salt as a memorial of a soul devoid of faith. 3Di Ant. I, XI, 4. These latter comments are in anticipation of a notion to be argued in the next pericope, that the isolation and a worthy desire to repopulate a supposedly empty world motivated the incest, rather than lust. The Bible (Gen. 19.30) portrays Lot as dwelling on a mountain in a cave, since he feared to enter ipo'ar, and I find no parallel to the lack of food and miserable existence; it seems, however, readily derivable from the Bible. 303 This view is paralleled in many rabbinic passages: Gen. R. LI; and PsRPsR XLII. Other views regard the action as pure incest, Tan. Balaq, XXVI. So, too, Jub. XVI, 8. Josephus' view is readily deducible from Scripture. Aptowitzer in Parteipolitik der Hasmonaerzeit, cited in Rappaport, 106-107, argues that the view exculpating Lot's daughters, stems from the Davidic partisans who were anti-Hasmonean; it is recalled that David was a descendant of Ruth the Moabite; the severe condemnation of the daughters would represent the Hasmonean parties. 304 Ant.

Josephus adds that a grievous disease was inflicted by God on Abimelech, and the physicians despaired of his life.306 Josephus omits the mention of Abraham as a prophet.307 Sarah, as before, is Abraham's niece, not his sister. He portrays Abi melech as assuring Abraham that Sarah had remained un touched, as God and Sarah could testify. He offers Abraham the choice of remaining in the land, in full abundance; or, should Abraham wish to depart, he will be given an escort, but only after he will have obtained what he has come to the land to get. They settle matters amicably and swear an oath at Beer Sheba.308 Josephus next relates the birth of Isaac. He gives the etymology of the name as "laughter," though he repeats that Sarah had "smiled." The child is born a year later.305 Josephus adds to the bare account of the circumcision that from that time on the Jewish practice has been to circumcise after eight days.310 The Arabs defer the ceremony, Josephus adds, until the thir teenth year because Ishmael was circumcised at that age. Jo sephus again mentions his intention to discuss circumcision at length.3" At first Sarah loves Ishmael as if he were her own son, since he has been trained for rulership.312 After the birth of Isaac, she holds it wrong for him to be brought up with Ishmael, since she 305 Gen. 20. 306 Amplified from Gen. 20.7, "let him (Abraham) pray for you, that you may live," etc.; and from 17-18, which describe the disease as sterility.

The water and food give out, and Hagar, not wishing to see the little boy expire, puts him under a fir tree.317 The angel of God meets her and gives her the promise of Ishmael's future greatness. She meets some shepherds318 and through their help escapes from her miseries.319 When Ishmael is grown, Hagar obtains a wife from among the Egyptians for him.320 313 A somewhat similar fear of difficulties after Abraham's death is found in Tos. Sotah VI. Josephus writes the account in such a way as to justify the harshness of Sarah; the rabbis, who are faced with no such apolo getic need, tell tales of attempts by Ishmael to kill Isaac or of Ishmael's idolatry. 314 The Bible says merely "drive out this maid servant and her son." Again Josephus is softening the harshness. 313 Ν777rtos. It seems to be forgotten that in the biblical account Ishmael is at least an adolescent. Josephus is influenced by Gen. 21.14, which seems to say that Ishmael was put on his mother's shoulder. The rabbis, Gen. R. LI LI II, ask how a lad of twenty-seven could be so carried; it is replied that Sarah has put an evil eye on Ishmael so that he is smitten by a fever, cannot walk, and therefore must be borne. Because of the fever Ishmael drinks a great deal, and that is why the container of water is soon emptied. In PRE XXX substantially the same story is told; Ishmael's age is there given as twenty four. See below, note 286 in Chapter III. 316 Similarly, this is regarded by the rabbis as Abraham's severest trial up to this point, PRE XXX. 317 Josephus seems to have written this passage on the model of Euripides, Hercules Hercules Furens 323-324. He has omitted the statement in the Bible that Hagar lost her way, Gen. 21.14, which Tar. Jon. emphasizes even more than does MT. 318 This is peculiar to Josephus. 31' Ant.

Abraham loves Isaac because he is an only son and was born on the threshold of Abraham's old age. Isaac evokes the affection of his parents even more by his practice of every virtue and by showing obedience to his parents and zeal for the worship of God.322 Abraham rests all his own happiness on the hope of leaving his son unscathed when he will depart from this life.323 God appears to Abraham to test him.324 First he enumerates all the benefits that He has bestowed upon Abraham, such as his conquest of his enemies and his present felicity, and his posses sion of Isaac.325 He commands Abraham to offer his son by his own hand.326 He bids Abraham to take the child to the mount of Moriah327 and to make a burnt offering of him. Thereby he would show his piety in putting God's pleasure above the safety of the child.328 Abraham believes that he must obey, because everything that befalls God's favored one is ordained by divine providence.329 He conceals from Sarah the divine commandment and his own 321 Josephus like Jubilees goes directly from the marriage of Ishmael to to the Binding of Isaac, omitting the second incident of Abimelech, Gen. 21.22-34. 322 This is peculiar to Josephus. Philo has a description somewhat similar to this passage, Abr. 168. The differences, however, are sufficient to preclude a necessary dependency of Josephus on Philo here, since the similarity con sists only in depicting Isaac in terms of endowments of his own. Josephus is here describing Isaac in terms intelligible to Greek readers, in this lies the only similarity to Philo. 323 Peculiar to Josephus. 321' Gen. 22.1.

He portrays the servants as left on the plain while Abraham and Isaac proceed to the mountain.332 It is the mountain on which David afterwards erects the Temple.333 Isaac, now twenty-five,334 asks what will be sacrificed, and Abraham replies that God will provide for them in everything, and that He will send a sacrifice.335 The altar is now all prepared. Abraham then tells Isaac of his prayers for Isaac's birth, the birth itself, his care for Isaac's upbringing, and of his hope to bequeath his dominion to him.336 Isaac replies in kind, and rushes to the altar.337 God intervenes to stop the slaughter. He reveals that it is all only a test which Abraham has passed creditably. Isaac, accordingly, will be blessed with offspring who will inherit the land of Canaan. God then brings a ram into their view.338 They offer the ram 33» Scripture makes no mention of Sarah in the context, so that this silence is readily to be inferred. Philo also portrays Abraham as telling no one of the divine oracle, Abr. 170. The rabbis, however, portray Abraham as telling Sarah that he is taking Isaac, now thirty-seven, to school, PRE XXXI and MHGMHG to Gen. 22.2. 33' Philo omits this, Abr. 170-171. 332 The mention of the plain is peculiar to Josephus, but deducible from Gen. 22.4; Abraham raises his eyes to see the mountain. He must, therefore, have been on a lower level. Jubilees XVIII, 4 provides a well for the servants. Philo identifies these as the oldest and most faithful of the numerous servants, while Josephus dees not identify them. The rabbis identify them as Ishmael and Eliezer, Lev. R.

The rabbinic stories, like Jubilees, introduce Satan in a prologue and have him reappear throughout the episode. Josephus seems familiar with such narratives; if they are known to him it is likely that it is his naturalism which leads him to suppress the appearances of Satan. 333337 Josephus, like Philo, Abr. 176, omits the mention of the actual binding. Philo, however, portrays Abraham as putting Isaac on the altar. 338 Josephus transposes the blessing of Isaac to precede the divine promises. He omits God's oath, Gen. 22.16.</page><page sequence="45">[45] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 195 and, in joy, return to Sarah.339 They live in bliss, with God helping them in all they desire.340 Not long afterwards, Sarah dies.341 The Canaanites offer her burial-ground at public expense342 but Abraham buys the spot. He and his descendants build their tombs at this place.343 Next Josephus mentions Abraham's marriage to Keturah, and their offspring. Abraham sends out all these to found colonies. They take possession of Troglodytis and the part of Arabia Felix which extends to the Red Sea.344 Africa is named after Eophron (either Eyfa or Efer of Gen. 25.4) who led an expe dition against Libya and occupied it; his grandsons settled there and named the land after him. This is attested to by Alexander Polyhistor who cites from Cleodemus the prophet, also called Malchus, that of the several sons of Abraham three gave their names to a land: Sures (Ashurim) to Assyria, Japhras (?) to Apheras, and Aphra (Efar) to the country of Africa. These latter joined Heracles in his campaign against Libya and Antaeus.343 Heracles married the daughter of Aphra, begot Didorus, who begot Sophron after whom the "Barbarians" are called Sophakes.346 Josephus next turns back to Abraham's sending Eliezer to Aram.347 Eliezer brings Rebekkah back with him; Isaac, now י3נ Genesis records only that Abraham returned.

He is buried at Hebron, beside Sarah, by Isaac and Ishmael.350 It is difficult, in a positive way, to state the significance of Abraham to Josephus. The truth is that Josephus does not exhibit any striking, unified, coherent conception of the Pat riarch. He gives little more than a pedestrian recapitulation of Scripture, omitting some minor details, naturalizing others, and supplying some traditional embellishments, but his Abraham is written without betraying any meditation, insight, or assessment. The traditional material which Josephus preserves provides him with some details, but these details are never shaped into a a body of discerning material. Josephus writes as the kind of historian who records incidents and dates, but who shows little interest in the significance of what he is writing about. The Abraham who roams about his pages is dressed in the garb of a Greek philosopher, but Josephus gives no true insight into what kind of a philosopher he is; he makes the asser tion, but he follows the assertion with only a pitifully weak demonstration. The abundant use of haggadic material would seem to point to the possibility of Josephus' knowledge of traditions of Abra ham as an observer of the Law, especially since this viewpoint is found in Jubilees. Josephus says not one thing about Abraham's relationship to the Law of Moses or to the Greek notions of law. Josephus' assertion351 that much of his book, which professes to treat of laws and historical fact, is devoted to "physiology" is hardly borne out by the rest of his book. In fact, he defers to another time the writing of "Customs and Causes"352 in a spirit 348 Gen. 25.5: Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac.

He is simply one of many biblical characters. Josephus makes no mention of Abraham as a source of merit to his descendants; he says not one word about Abraham as an exemplar of any kind. He omits the mention of the covenant. Abraham is simply the philosopher who left the land of Canaan to his descendants. Abraham is the first to declare the unity of God. He goes to Egypt to learn if Egyptian doctrine is superior to his own; he teaches the Egvp tians mathematics and astronomy, and is the medium by which this knowledge comes ultimately to the Greeks. Abraham is able to refute all the Egyptians. The picture, a most superficial one, simply casts the patriarch into an ill-fitting mold of a philosopher, and apologetically credits him with matters honorable in the Greek scene. To put it another way, Josephus omits in his presentation of Abraham those very distinctive qualities which exalted Abraham in Jubilees and in the later rabbinic literature; by a touch here and there (the tent becomes a house, the war of the kings becomes a military expedition, Sarah could have been buried at public expense, Abraham possesses "virtues") Josephus gives Abraham something of a hellenistic color, but only a faint one. He deprives Abraham of the striking hues in which the rabbis paint him;3s4 he fails to give Abraham any deeply true characteristics in the Greek tradition. In rabbinic literature, in conformity with the elaborate exe getical method developed by the rabbis, the relevant Scriptural passages served as means of inferring extended and magnified conclusions explicit from the text, as well as new conclusions which are bound to Scripture only by the tenuous thread of the exegetical method. Gen. 18 tells an incident of Abraham's hos pitality, and the rabbis deduce from almost any conceivable passage that Abraham was hospitable. The view that Abraham 353 Ant. Proem, 4. 354 If Josephus used Jubilees, he must have known the legend of Abraham smashing idols. His failure to use this material may be the fear that it would be offensive to his Greek readers, and weaken the effectiveness of his apolo getics.</page><page sequence="48">198 SAMUEL SANDMEL [48] was a great missionary, a matter not expressed at all in Scripture, takes on in rabbinic exegesis a rigidity and formality almost equal to the biblical view that Abraham was hospitable. The rabbinic exegesis, like the Philonic, pays little regard to the context. The verse itself, lifted completely out of its setting, serves the darshan for whatever purpose he might wish. The point of departure is the darshan s immediate need or his imme diate interest, and, accordingly, the rabbinic Abraham is a character associated with the problems and speculations not of patriarchal days but of rabbinic times. One could construct an almost complete picture of rabbinic theology and rabbinic atti tudes from only the Abraham material. a. The Recognition of the Existence of God The rabbis agree that Abraham was the first man who recognized the existence of God ; they disagree at what age he came to that praiseworthy conclusion. By one view he was still a babe, only a year old;355 by another he was three;356 by a third, ten; the usual view, repeated most frequently, was that Abraham was forty-eight.357 The recognition came to him as a result of an inference; he saw a lighted house, and he conjectured that the house must have a master. Similarly, the existence of the world meant that it had a Guide.358 b. God's Elect Abraham had come to the recognition of God in an impure land, for idolatry prevailed there.359 God enjoined upon him to depart not only from the province and, not only from the immediate vicinity, but also from his father's house.360 God, in fact, appeared to Abraham in the guise of a friend who pushes and says, "Go."361 355 Gen.

No one priced a cow in a transaction with Abraham without being blessed; ships at sea were saved on his behalf; even where "profane" wine was expensive, "kosher" wine was inexpensive; sick people whom Abraham visited immediately improved.368 That Gen. 12.2-3 uses the root gdl three times and brk four times is a clear indication that the blessing pointed to the existence of three patriarchs and four matriarchs.369 These seven mentions accord with the seven occurrences in Gen. 1 of ki &lt;of&gt;.37° Abraham's fame was such that coins depicting him and Sarah on one side, and Isaac and Rebekkah on the other, were widespread throughout the world.371 Abraham was not only a blessing (berakah), he was a spring (berekah) which purifies the impure.372 3&lt;* Gen.

The blessings acquired through Abraham by the nations of the world are an allusion to Ruth the Moabite and Naamah the Ammonite.379 The dew and the rain were the blessings given to the world through Abraham.380 The blessings of the nations are not those of wealth, for in this they exceed Israel; it is that when trouble overtakes them, they can turn to Israel for relief.381 The entire world was blessed through Abraham and Sarah.382 The world derived its blessing from Abraham, but Abraham's blessing came directly from God.383 The full blessing of Abraham ensued after he had withstood ten severe trials.384 Scripture declares that God blessed Abraham385 ba-kol (in everything).

Another view is that a precious stone suspended from Abraham's neck brought immediate cure to any sick person who beheld it; after Abraham's death the stone was suspended from a wheel of the sun's chariot.386 Other views interpret ba-kol to mean that Ishmael repented during Abraham's lifetime, or that Esau's rebellion was deferred until after Abraham's death.387 Still other views regard ba-kol as indicating that Abraham in this world received a foretaste of the world to come; or, that the evil inclination did not rule over him; or, that after death, worms did not consume his flesh.388 The blessing promised numerous offspring, and it was ful filled when Israel came out of Egypt.389 The land of Canaan was promised, and the promise was kept.390 In another sense, Abraham was a blessing in that he taught his guests the blessing of Grace after the Meal.391 God made him a partner in the possession of the earth.392 This partnership gave Abraham authority, however, both over heavenly creations as well as earthly ones.393 It was such authority, transmitted, which enabled Joshua to make the sun stand still.394 The possession of the heaven was fulfilled in the descendants' inheritance of the Torah which came from heaven, while the heritage of the earth was their great number ; and both of these heritages derived from Abraham's piety.393 There was, in fact, no blessing which God omitted to confer upon Abraham: wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and intel ligence; wealth and possessions; heaven and earth.396 38' B.

His Virtues Abraham showed his obedience by departing from Haran imme diately after the divine command, and, in taking Lot with him, obeyed beyond what was commanded.397 This, despite the fact that Lot was a hindrance.398 Abraham consumed no time in questions about his destination, or where he should lodge on the way, or in any such delaying questions.399 That famine overtook him as soon as he arrived in Canaan did not elicit rebellious complaints from him.400 On being commanded to circumcise, he obeyed on the very same day.401 He obeyed promptly the com mand to sacrifice Isaac.402 He arose early to take Isaac to the binding, because he obeyed with gladness.403 He saddled the ass joyously.404 The frame of mind of affection erases the aspect of burden, and though Abraham had plenty of servants, he himself saddled the ass.405 The obedience conformed with his righteousness. He was the righteous man406 summoned from the east.4"7 The fact that he was tested proves his righteousness, for only the righteous are tried.408 The foremost among righteous men,4"9 he was the pro genitor of the righteous.410 He offered the strangers bread,411 but actually gave them a banquet, for it is the custom of the righteous to promise little but do much.

Indeed, the greatness of righteousness lies in this, that it was in righteousness that Abraham was exalted.417 Abraham's faith was great, and it was the merit of that faith that enabled him to inherit both this world and the world to come.418 The faith of Abraham was great enough to induce God to split the Red Sea.419 Because of Abraham, Israel is spoken of as "the faithful, sons of the faithful."420 The Song of the Sea, sung in the faith, was sung through the merit of Abraham who had faith.421 The phrase, "pure in heart,"422 is a description of Abraham's faith.425 The faith which Israel lacked and for which Jeremiah chided them424 was Abraham's faith.425 Humbly he described himself426 as a servant.427 It was this humility which prompted the angels to pause and visit him.428 Even in the hour in which God condescended to converse with him,42' Abraham retained his humility, for though God was ag grandizing him, he termed himself dust and ashes.430 Indeed, humility is a sign that one is a disciple of Abraham.431 Although he had been promised the entire land by God, nevertheless when 4!4 Tan.

He pitched Sarah's tent before his own.441 On his return from Egypt he stopped at the inns he had lodged in on the way to Egypt to pay his bills.442 He kept his cattle muzzled so they would not graze on property not his own.443 While Lot, careless of pollution, first invited the strangers to spend the night and then to wash, Abraham carefully invited them first to wash and then to lodge.444 To avoid the gossip about Lot and his daughters he moved to Gerar.445 He waited until he had married off Isaac before he wed Keturah.446 434 MHG to Gen. 23.4. «3 Ezek. 17.24. «4 MHG to Gen. 21.1. 43s Gen.

Those, however, who have sinned very much have their "foreskins" restored by Abraham, by grafting on foreskins taken from babes who died before their eighth day; thereby the sinners enter Hell, and Abraham saves the babes.619 His capacity as an intercessor endures for many generations.620 The rabbinic literature reads back into the career of the patriarch its own interests and concerns. Abraham observes the written Torah and the Oral Torah. He sits in an Academy learning halakot. He gives tithes; he prays. He travels to the site of the Temple; he teaches the Grace after the Meal. The originator of faith in the true God, he abides in that faith against persecuting idolators. His sagacity is great; he is a source of gnomic wisdom, and he conducts himself in accord with the amenities and with high standards of courtesy. He is not without imperfections, and he makes errors; he rises to greatness without losing his humanity. Abraham is depicted in such terms that were one to be a perfect imitator of Abraham, he would thereby be conforming to the highest of rabbinic standards and be an executor of rabbinic laws. To the rabbis, one might say, Abraham is a rabbi. 616 B. B. 91. 61ל Gen. R. LXII. 1518 SER VI.VI. &lt;«» Gen. R. XLVIII. '» Gen. R. XXXV.</page><page sequence="67">[67] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 217 Chapter Three Abraham in Philo's Writings I Troublesome problems in methodology inhere in any effort to give an exposition of Philonic thought.1 These are occasioned by the character of Philo's treatises, with their rapid shifts of figures and even of subject matter, and with their frequent apparently inconsistent and occasionally contradictory terms or even no tions. In the present instance, an immediate problem stems from what might be described as Philo's double approach to Scripture, namely his use of what he terms the literal and the allegorical. The difficulty is that Philo himself gives us such a division, but he is by no means rigid about the division, and the commen tator who would separate these strands too sharply can find himself doing inadvertent injustice to Philo's thought. To antic ipate a distinction discussed in detail below, there is a literal Abraham in Philo and there is an allegorical Abraham. The literal Abraham is the historical character of the simple biblical account, though by no means a character of such simplicity in Philo; it is the Abraham who migrated from Chaldea, to Haran, and then to Palestine, who was the husband of Sarah; who rescued Lot; who begot Ishmael and Isaac; and who ultimately passed away in good old age. The allegorical Abraham is the historical character who abandoned pantheistic materialism and went on to the cognition of the true God by a process of freeing his soul from domination by the body. Philo inherited both of these Abrahams and he propagated them both. Yet, while he himself distinguishes between them, he cannot present his literal Abraham in a treatise such as De Abrahamo without the intrusion of allegorical overtones which are in some instances merely nuances while in others they are direct statements. We shall 1 Cf. scholarly expressions of methodological dismay assembled in Vôlker, op. cit., 5 ff.</page><page sequence="68">218 SAMUEL SANDMEL [68] see that Philo begins one passage in this treatise as "allegory," but terminates it as though it had been "literal," and he then proceeds to allegorize an already allegorized incident. Accor dingly, the literal Abraham is in several ways more than only a recasting of biblical narratives. Next, the allegorical Abraham is also a number of related and associated matters: It is the "figure for the good mind," a peg on which Philo suspends his quasi-philosophical inferences from the Scriptural text. Again, the allegorical Abraham is the figure for any good mind, for Philo's own mind, or for the mind of the historical patriarch. This "figure" varies from being a type to being an individual. Where it is a type, the specific "Abraham" can be de-emphasized to the point of disappearance, as when Philo discussed with some philosophical objectivity the logos logos tomeus, or the value of the encyclia, or the nature of ecstasis. But these discussions obtain their relevance for Philo by their association, however tenuous it may be in context, with the allegorical Abraham. A large portion of Philo's writings are given over to objective explanations of the "type." But Philo goes considerably beyond the objectivity of explanation; he portrays the historical Abra ham as the individual who experienced these explained abstrac tions vividly and intimately. That is to say, Philo not only tells us what, for example, ecstasis was, he also tells us that Abraham underwent it. The literal Abraham can be described as the record of Abraham's "body"; the allegorical Abraham is Philo's account of the progress and destiny of Abraham's soul. The methodological problem involved in the allegorical Abra ham is that some passages both explain philosophical ideas and utilize these in a "spiritual biography" of Abraham; but some passages state only one aspect explicitly, leaving the other aspect to be inferred. Initially I set out to arrange the philosoph ical explanations in some reasonable order, and I proposed thereafter to fit the individual into that series of explanations. I found myself presenting a series of vignettes from Philo's thought in a manner that has ultimately seemed as unnecessary as it was pedestrian. These philosophical explanations fit in with the entire body of Philonic explanations; indeed, they coincide</page><page sequence="69">[69] PHILO' S PLACE IN JUDAISM 219 with and overlap them. Philo explains the body, the senses, the mind, the encyclia, and other matters in contexts unrelated to Abraham. The exodus of Israel from Egypt, for example, requires Philo to parallel and duplicate in that "spiritual" journey many of the matters he touches upon in the history of Abraham. Since my task is not primarily to reproduce the totality of Philonic thought,2 but Philo's conception of Abraham, I have determined to present the allegorical Abraham as the experience of the individual, and to present in annotation the relevant explanations associated with the type. I am not satisfied that I have eliminated all repetitiousness. Philo's manner precludes success, no matter how zealously the commentator tries. Still Still Still another problem in methodology has been that of ar ranging the allegorical material. A verse by verse sequence of the germane passages in Genesis does not yield a cumulative picture. For while Philo does utilize a number of verses in a series for individual treatises such as Heres or Migratio, or in some portions of Quaestiones in Genesin, he by no means binds himself to the biblical sequence. For Philo the culmination of the religious experience is the "vision of God"; this culmination ensues for a sage who goes beyond the encyclia into true philosophy and virtue. Philo interprets passages in Gen. 12 and Gen. 15 to prove that Abraham had this culminating experience; but he utilizes Gen. 16 (Hagar as the encyclia) as a preparatory and preliminary matter. Similarly, Keturah (the sense of smell) appears virtually at the end of the biblical portion on Abraham, Gen. 25, and Philo interprets Keturah, as we shall see, as an early stage which Abraham passed beyond. Philo plucks his verses, individually or in a series, from whatever chapter these chance to occur in, and he brings them, regardless of the biblical position or context, into congruency with his predetermined purpose. Therefore, there was little to gain from presenting the allegorical Abraham in the biblical sequence. a The Abraham material alone touches on virtually every problem in Philo. I have no intention here of recapitulating what Wolfson, Drummond. and Bréhier have done.</page><page sequence="70">220 SAMUEL SANDMEL [70] I present the allegorical material, instead, as a range of matters in what seems to me to be true to Philo's use and intent. I have found a Philonic device, his interpretation of Gen. 15.9, helpful in arranging the allegorical material, in that it has enabled me to use subdivisions of Philo's rather than some arbitrary arrangement of my own. One final item, an understanding of which may perhaps give cohesiveness and clarity to the inevitable reflection in my own exposition of Philo's discursiveness, tergiversations, and crotch ets. To begin with an example, I have frequent occasion in the footnotes to comment that Lot is at times Abraham at a stage in his development, yet at other times a figure in contrast with Abraham. Such a disparity in treatment does not result from any genuine inconsistency in Philo but rather, it seems to me, from his over-all conception of Scripture. While it has been frequently noted that Philo tells us over and over again that the allegory of Scripture is the record of the progress of the Soul,3 and commentators have noted this facet in strands or sections of Philo's writings, I have seen nowhere any effort to depict the significance of Scripture as a totality to Philo.4 3 See Bréhier, 45 ff. for the relevant passages. 4 Virtually all the commentators, Drummond, Kennedy, Wolfson, etc., content themselves with noting that Philo reads "Greek philosophy" into OT. Ergo, most commentators search and research the philosophical problems raised by Philo's exegesis. The by-product is that all too often the commen tators, as for example Wolfson, give us what was latent in Philo's mind, but abstain from recreating and interpreting Philo's direct and avowed intent. All too little attention has been paid to the essentially Philonic in Philo's writings, namely, his religious experience and orientation and his exhortation to his readers to practice religion! Bréhier, it would seem to me, is the nearest of the general commentators to state the quintessence of Philo; but there is a margin of difference between, on the one hand, what Philo sees in Scripture, and, on the other hand, what Philo sees Scripture as. Goodenough says many per ceptive and enlightening things that touch on the matter, but these are found in various sections of his By Light, Light, with the result that they are not quickly seen as a totality. My effort to portray the forest rather than the various trees owes a debt primarily to Goodenough. But the forest remains undepicted as far as I know in the scholarly writings. Goodenough has written on Abraham in his By Light, Light, Chapter 5, "Enos, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham," and in An Introduction to Philo Judaeus, especially pp. 187-189. Professor Goodenough is my mentor in Philonic</page><page sequence="71">[71] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 221 I have treated this matter in an as yet unpublished paper5 and I shall here give only a brief résumé. Philo sees in Scripture the experience of every man. In its literal sense it dealt with ancient times, events and personalities; allegory, however, makes Scripture the record of the unfolding experience of the reader.6 The original Adam (of Gen. 1.27) was a heavenly creation, and unmixed with material things. He is the rational, pre existent soul. This soul becomes mixed with clay from the earth when God "fashions" the earthy Adam of Gen. 2.7. There is joined to him Eve, sense-perception; but the serpent, pleasure, intrudes to divert man from lofty obligations into harmful ones. Man (mind) thereupon is quite different in his individual earthy state from what pure, generic mind was before it became mixed with body (in birth), and the mind intent on salvation must there fore free itself of the encumbrance of the body so as to regain its pristine immaterial purity. Every man spends his babyhood in pursuing the vices of the body, Egypt; later he encounters the vices of adolescence, Canaan. It is then that he has to make his choice whether to remain in body, as did the king of Egypt; or whether to be foolish, as was Abimelech the king of the Philistines; or to depart from senses and passions, as the good man does. At this stage of choice every man faces the contra dictory tendencies and therefore he wavers like Lot, inclining partly to what is good and partly to what is evil. studies, and I owe him many debts. The figure of Abraham is not central in his studies as it is in the present manuscript of mine, and consequently my exposition, however derivative, is fuller and also diverges at points. 5 "The Authority of the Bible for Philo" read at the Week of Work of the National Council on Religion in Higher Education, Meadville, Pa., August, 1952• See Judaism IV (19S5), I, pp. 47-57. 6 I recognize the proximity of these words to the "religious existentialist" interpretation, made somewhat fashionable by the wide interest in Kirke gaard. I have not yet seen G. Kuhlmann's Theologia naturalis bei Philon und beibei Paulus (Neutestamentliche Forschungen, Heft 7, 1930), which Vôlker, 43, sneers at, in that it appears to make Philo the outstanding representative of modern existentialism, "der mit scharfem Blicke bereits aile Problème des Jahres 1930 kannte." It is, of course, essential for a case not to be overstated; I ascribe to Philo a kind of "existentialism,1' but that is far removed from making him a disciple of modern Protestant theologians.</page><page sequence="72">222 SAMUEL SANDMEL [72] The soul, or mind, which is to progress, goes through three stages on its march to perfection. Initially he must have hope, Enos. Next, he must have repentance, Enoch, the abandonment of his previous ways. Thereupon he has arrived at the stage of rest or tranquility, which is Noah. At this stage his mind is righteous, if weighed by a standard which is less than truly exalted. To press on towards perfection, each mind has natural endowments, which number three, and which are present in every perfectible mind, though in varying degrees. They are, respectively, the ability to be taught (Abraham), natural virtue (Isaac) and perfection attained through practice (Jacob). The perfection through being taught involves the departure from error and from adolescent vice for a sojourn in the univer sity education, the "encyclical studies," Hagar. At that stage the mind being less than perfect can produce only sophistry (Ishmael). Progressing beyond factual knowledge the mind comes upon Sarah, "wisdom" or "virtue." But man does not achieve his own happiness; it is a gift to man from God, born out of man's virtue; hence God sows seeds in Sarah who bears the offspring, joy (Isaac), to man. Isaac, natural perfection, mates with Rebekkah, constancy. Jacob, the practicer, marries Leah, "virtue attained through toil" (out of whom God produces offspring, individual virtues). Laban, "brightness," the way of thinking governed by the senses, has no real understanding of the proper sequence in the attainment of virtue, and insists that Jacob must marry Leah even before Jacob has gone beyond Rachel, "superficiality." Jacob bears Dan, "distinguishing," out of Bilhah, "swallowing," sustaining life. Zilpah ("walking mouth") is the power of proper and correct expression of thoughts. Man must migrate with all his capacities from the area of the "senses," Haran, as Jacob fled from Laban, to become metamorphosed from the "practicer" into Israel, "seer of God." Every perceptive man can see in the experiences of the patriarchs reflections in himself of the use and development of his innate capacities. By following their example, he can come to perfection, that is, he can live on the level of pure mind,</page><page sequence="73">[73] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 223 unencumbered by the body. Indeed he can live on the level of the divine mind, the Logos. It is the experience of some men who, having attained to such perfection, abandon the concern with heavenly matters and turn to the lowly human affairs, as did Joseph. Insofar as Joseph had attained perfection, he had the qualities of the statesman, but his concern with mundane matters made him from time to time the objectionable "politician." Each of us who deals with human affairs descends from heavenly matters to earthly ones. The man who is able to marshall his gifts of teaching, nature, and practice is able to live on the level of "right reason." Such a level is that of Moses, who is the symbol of pure thought. Related to Moses, though lower, is his brother Aaron, "uttered thought." The cult practices of Judaism are the level of Aaron, a lower mystery, attained through the observance and execution of the literal laws of Scripture. But for the perfect soul, these laws are not as much requirements as they are exhortations. They are copies of the law of nature and are in conformity with that law. Hence, the literalist who observes the requirements of Judaism is automatically acting in conformity with nature. But if a man penetrates to the level of Moses, then he knows the deeper significance of the enacted laws, and, accordingly, he is living not by laws but by "nature" itself. The patriarchs and Moses are the exemplars of living by nature. The enacted, specific laws are the tool through which man can either consciously or unconsciously live by the higher law. That is, the Bible is the vehicle by which man, a mixture of body and soul, can gain salvation; he can escape the domi nation of the body, for which the enacted laws provide the formula, and ultimately live by divine reason itself. Indeed, through God's grace he may from time to time receive the vision of God.7 7 I think it has not been noted that there is a clear intimation of all the above in Philo's Exposition. Opificio deals with Creation and with the two Adams; De Abrahamo presents the triad, Enos, Enoch, and Noah as prepar atory to the patriarchs, before concentrating on Abraham. The treatises on Isaac and Jacob are lost. The next treatise, Joseph, deals with the problems of</page><page sequence="74">224 SAMUEL SANDMEL [74] From the standpoint that the biblical materials are the experience, actual or potential, items otherwise enigmatic become intelligible. Thus, Philo mentions his own desire to be mated with Sarah (wisdom). He exhorts those of us who read him (and he writes with exhortatory imperatives) to abandon Chaldea and migrate to the wilderness. In our context, the methodological problem is that such exhortations to us or attestations of his personal experience become intermingled with his exegetical exposition of the bib lical personalities. At every opportunity Philo may not state that it was his allegorical Abraham who married Hagar, the "encyclical studies" ; he may do no more than tell what transpires when he, or one of us who reads him, "marries" her. In assembling my material on Abraham I have attempted to abstain from going beyond Philo's own utterances; but very often there are passages in which the "Abraham-type" is so vividly implicit in Philo that it has not seemed to me straining too much to make it explicit. Moreover, the point of departure for such material in Philo is some verse or sequence of verses in the chapters in which the Bible portrays Abraham. Accordingly, even where Philo does not always specifically mention Abraham, such Philonic passages have a relevance for us in that they can illuminate what Philo saw in the verses which in the Bible deal with Abraham. After I present the literal and the allegorical Abraham as separate aspects, I discuss the relationship between them. I find this necessary not only as a logical procedure, but as a corrective of whatever inadvertent distortion can result from a too-rigid separation of the two. Thereafter I discuss the religious import of Abraham to Philo. I show that Abraham is an exemplar of the religious mystic who rises above sense and body into communion with God. Abraham is one of Philo's proofs that the Philonic formula for true religious living, by metaphysical reality, is not only feasible, but that it was accomplished in history. human affairs. Next come the treatises on Moses, ensued by the Decalogue and the four treatises on The Special Laws.</page><page sequence="75">[75] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 225 Finally, I conclude that the Philonic Abraham owes few debts, if any, to the rabbinic Abraham, or to the various Abra hams of the extra-canonical writings. I conclude, also, that the connection between Philo's Abraham and the Abraham of the earlier hellenistic Jews is very tenuous, and distinguished more by differences than by sporadic and superficial similarity.8 II The primary source for the literal Abraham is the treatise De De Abrahamo. (This treatise is part of the Exposition and is often confused by students with De Migratione Abrahami, which is part of the Allegory.) There is a little material in Quaestiones in Genesin, but Philo's typical treatment there is to state that the literal meaning is obvious, and he therefore proceeds immediately to the Allé gorical. This section of our study deals primarily with De Abrahamo,Abrahamo, and we will presently revert to it as our main interest. A summary passage in Virt. gives us Philo's view of Abraham succinctly. Though Abraham's ancestors were men of guilt, Abraham's own life is worthy of emulation9 and full of good report. Though the son of an astrologer, whose creed is that there is no originating cause outside what we perceive by the 8 The literature most frequently cited in this section is as follows: Good enough, By Light, Light; Wolfson, Philo, two vols.; Bréhier, Les idées philo sophiquessophiques et religieuses de Philon; Drummond, Philo Judaeus; or, the Jewish Alexandrian Alexandrian Philosophy in its Development and Completion', Colson and Whitaker, Philo (Loeb Classical Series) I-IX (Colson alone for VI-IX) ; and Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews. I cite these only by the author. י A clear expression of an item frequently hinted at is Knox's notice that in Philo Abraham is an exemplar of the proselyte who voluntarily abandoned astrology in favor of the truth. See "Abraham and the Quest for God," HTR XXVIII (1939) 55-60. A note of my own, "Abraham's Knowledge of the Exis tence of God," HTR (XLIV) (1951) 137-139 suggests only a slight modifica tion of Knox's thesis which I hold to be sound. The motif, frequent in rab binic literature, that Abraham was the great missionary, is lacking in Philo. Disparities in time and the danger of comparing the one Philo with the many rabbis inhibit a facile generalization; one might tentatively suggest that, with respect to proselytism, for the rabbis Abraham is the missionary par excel lence, while for Philo he is the significant "convert."</page><page sequence="76">226 SAMUEL SANDMEL [76] senses, Abraham perceives that there is nothing more grievous to the nobility of the soul than that knowledge of secondary things should lead to the ignoring of the One, the Primal. This perception, along with divine inspiration, induces Abraham to leave his native country, his race, and his paternal home. He knows that if he stays, the delusions of the polytheistic creed will stay within him and render it impossible for him to discover the One God. But if he moves, the delusion will move out of his mind, and the false creed will be replaced by truth. At the same time he yearns to know God, and this yearning is fanned up by divine injunctions. With these to guide his steps, he goes forth, never faltering in his ardor to seek for the One, nor does he pause until he receives clearer visions.10 Abraham is properly spoken of as the first to believe in God,11 for he first grasped a firm and unswerving conception that there is one Cause above all.12 There are two classes of men, some earth-born, and some heaven-born. Men of God are those who refuse to accept mem bership in the commonwealth of the cosmos. Abraham is such a man of heaven, who rises from the world to a better state, to the commonwealth of ideas which are imperishable and incor poreal. He is himself a man of God.13 Respecting De Abrahamo, its form was recognized by PriessnigI3a as hellenistic. Priessnig terms the treatise an edifying theological biography, and he finds it in accord with the literary conventions of the period.14 Philo uses a topical arrangement; 10 Virt. 211-215. The passage is a good example of Philo's merging of the literal and the allegorical. Abraham leaves Chaldea; Abraham leaves astrol ogy; departure from the literal Chaldea ensures departure from astrology. 11 Based on Gen. 15.6. " Virt., 216. גי Gig. 58-61. ני» "Die literarische Form der Patriarchenbiographien des Philon von Alexandrien," MGWJ, LXXIII (1929), 143 ff. 14 14 Wendland had antecendently shown that Philo's literary form was similar to the Cynic and Stoic writings, "Philo und die kynisch-stoische Diatribe," in Wendland, Paul und Kern, Otto, Beitrage zur Geschichte der GriechischenGriechischen Philosophie und Religion, 1895. Wolfson, recognizing this hel lenistic influence, would nevertheless assert the "native Jewish midrashic" character of Philo's writing; I, 95-96. Wolfson's remarks may be appropriate</page><page sequence="77">[77] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 227 he departs from the biblical order and presents his Abraham in a series of episodes at variance with the biblical sequence.14a The topics, as Philo presents them (after a lengthy introduc tion ##1-59) are Abraham's piety, ##62-80; his perfection in wisdom, ##81-88; the reward of his piety, ##89-98; his hospi tality, a by-product of his piety, ##114-132; his greatest act of piety, the sacrifice of Isaac, ##167-207. So far Philo has been discussing Abraham's relation to God. His topics now turn to relations with men: his justice, ##208-216; his courage in war, ##217-244; his cultivation of moderation, ##245-261 ; and finally, his faith ##262-273. The human qualities are discussed, as Goodenough puts it,15 in terms of the Greek four great cardinal virtues, justice, courage, self-control, and wisdom. These, however, are matters of form, and not of content. It would not be impossible that the form of a treatise be helle nistic and the content Pharisaic Jewish. Such, however, is by no means the case. The content of De Abrahamo, and indeed, the Abraham explicit literally or implicit allegorically, through out Philo's writings is thoroughly hellenized. Apologetic motifs,16 to the Allegory and to QG and QE. Abr. and the other treatises of the Exposi tion,tion, however, are not in form midrashic homilies based on verses of the Bible, but rather topical treatises dissociated from a single verse or group of verses. The hellenistic form of De Abrahamo does not seem to me to be open to question. "י" Philo hearkens back to the Biblical passages in this order: Gen. 12.1—9; Gen.Gen. 11.26-32; Gen. 18; Gen. 12.10-20; Gen. 18; Gen. 19; Gen. 22; Gen. 13; Gen. 14; Gen. 16; Gen. 23; Gen. 15; Gen. 24; and Gen. 26. 1s By Light, Light, 142. Philo seems, however, to replace "prudence" with "faith" in this tractate. On Abraham's prudence, see QG IV,3, based on Gen. 18.2. 16 This is pointed out adequately in the standard works on apologetics by Giidemann, Krieger and Friedlander. The recent denial by Tscherikover (in 139-160 ,ספר יוחנן לוי) is not only too sweeping, but also rests on some confusion. Were it as Tscherikover believes, that Hellenistic-Jewish writers were writing only for Jews, that would still leave untouched the issue of the presence of apologetic motifs. Granted that the captious critics to whom Philo replies in De Abrahamo about the Binding of Isaac are from within the Jewish community, as I myself believe, the only difference this makes is in our awareness of towards whom the apologetics is directed. I see very little substance derivable from the supposedly radical revision which Tscherikover proposes.</page><page sequence="78">228 SAMUEL SANDMEL [78] as nuances and overtones, are by no means unknown in Philo's works, but Abraham is not a different character in De Abrahamo (possibly written for non-Jews) from the Abraham of the Allegory Allegory (written, probably, for Jews). The conception of Ab raham is so consistent and so integral in Philo's view of the Bible that it is impossible to regard his Abraham as having, in De De Abrahamo, a hellenistic garb for a judiciously selected apologetic occasion. Philo's Abraham is consistently clothed in the hellenistic wardrobe which Philo here provides, and these clothes are everywhere tailored to Philo's essential views, and not to a special presentation for Gentiles. For Philo, as for Paul and for the rabbis, a fundamental problem regarding Abraham is the relationship between Abra ham, the ancestor, and the descendant, Moses, and his Law. If Moses' Law was the divine law, how could Abraham (and the other patriarchs) have flourished without it? The rabbis solve the problem in their way by asserting that Abraham observed the Mosaic Law; in fact, Abraham observed the "Oral" Law also. Paul is caught in the dilemma of a repudiation of the Mosaic Law and some defense of it; his solution is to regard the Law as having only temporal validity, beginning long after Abraham, who did not observe it, and enduring until Jesus, at which time it was abrogated. Philo gives his own answer, an answer possible only in Greek and not rabbinic thinking: Ab raham observed the law of nature, and Abraham was himself a law; the Law of Moses is the copy of the law of nature, and the Law of Moses derives its specifications from those specific things which Abraham (and other patriarchs) did. Philo, accordingly, adds a subtitle to his treatise, De Abra hamo:hamo: "The Life of the Sage Made Perfect Through Instruction, or the First Book on Unwritten Laws." This treatise, Philo tells us, carries on an earlier one (Opificio) and both are part of an examination of "law" in an orderly sequence. He is not ready, however, to discuss the particular laws; those are only copies. First he will discuss those laws which are general (καθολίκώτίροι) and which can be considered as the archetypes of the copies.17 These original laws are men; these men lived " Abr. 3.</page><page sequence="79">[79] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 229 good and blameless lives. Scripture records their virtues for a purpose beyond sounding their praises: to instruct the reader and to induce him to emulate these men. These men are "laws incarnate and vocal." What Philo is saying in effect is that the biographies of Abraham and others in Genesis, and of Moses in Exodus are legal documents; that the Mosaic Law is the specific and the copy of the archetypal law found in Genesis. The rabbinic view is completely foreign to Philo. The rabbis take as their norm the Mosaic (and Oral) Law, and they bring Abraham up to the norm by portraying him as an observer. Philo, however, takes Abraham (and the Patriarchs) as the norm, and shows in what way the Law of Moses fits in with the norm. The rabbis say that Abraham observed the Law; Philo says that the Law sets forth as legislation those things which Abraham did.18 Philo is saying two different, though supplementary, things about Abraham and Law. First, he is telling us that Abraham's deeds become recorded law; second, he tells us that there is a law which Abraham observed, the law of nature, the most venerable of statutes.19 Insofar as he was a lawful man, it was the law of nature which Abraham followed. Since the particular laws, that is, the Mosaic code, are the copy of deeds of men who followed nature, the Mosaic Law is consistent with nature.20 It is no difficult task, Philo tells us, to follow the particular 18 Despite differences, Philo is near to Paul. Unlike Paul, he has no wish to abrogate the Law; indeed, he insists that it must be preserved. But like Paul (and against Jubilees and the rabbis) Philo concedes a temporal factor in the Law; this pertains to its institution in Moses' time. Paul and Philo coincide in conceiving of the Patriarchs as not living under the Law. Eusebius gives us what is almost a blending of Philo's views on Abraham with those of Paul in Romans; cf. Praep. Evang. VII, 8. " For pre-Stoic and Stoic views on "law of nature," see Drummond I, 76-94; Wolfson II, 170-183. Wolfson's effort to base Philo's presentation of natural law on Jewish tradition, ibid., 183 ff., is mental gymnastics, calculated to amuse but not persuade. For other material on the law of nature see Good enough, "The Political Philosophy of Hellenistic Kingship," Yale Classical Studies,Studies, I, (1928), 53-102. Additional literature is listed in Goodenough, The Politics Politics of Philo Judaeus, 44, footnote 7. 20 Abr. 5.</page><page sequence="80">230 SAMUEL SANDMEL [80] laws, since the patriarchs followed the unwritten law21 with ease.22 Philo makes this double aspect even clearer in the closing words of the treatise: Abraham was the first "who obeyed the law, some will say, but rather, as our discourse has shown, himself a law and an unwritten statute." What we deal with, then, in Abraham as a "legal" figure in Philo is a conception of natural law and specific laws which is as inherently Greek as it is alien to normative Judaism. Greek philosophers, who dealt with "natural law" and "laws incarnate and made vocal" would have understood Philo with no difficulty, since he writes and thinks in their realm. These words would, however, have been virtually unintelligible (and objectionable!) to the rabbis. Philo has in this treatise only passing concern for the Mosaic Law; where in other treatises he expresses concern for it, he always relegates it, as a copy, to a secondary position. It is, however, more than a random copy of the law of nature; it is the best possible copy and in conformity with it.23 We embark in our treatise, then, immediately into matters which are in content Greek and not "native" Jewish. Enos, Enoch, and Noah are examples of men who yearned for virtue, contrasted with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who attained it.24 Philo tells us that the patriarchs, though difffering from each other, must be regarded as a unit as well as individually. 21 As mentioned above, Wolfson, I, 188 f., holds that "unwritten law" is occasionally an allusion to Torah she-b-'al pe, against Heinemann, "Die Lehre vom Ungeschriebenen Gesetz im Jiidischen Schrifttum," HUCA, IV, 149 ff., whose case for the view that the "unwritten law" in Philo is never the rabbinic oral law seems impregnable to Wolfson's assault. 2222 Abr. 5. 2ג Philo likens the outward observances of the Law to the body, and the inner meaning to the soul, Mig. 89-93. The pattern of his Exposition is that he discusses in this treatise, in the lost treatises on Isaac and Jacob and in Moses the "general laws"; thereafter he proceeds in Decal. and Spec, to discuss the "copies." 22 Philo's figure of speech contrasts the first three as children, against the second three as athletes preparing for games which are really sacred. The figure is, of course, derived from the environment, and Philo does not hesitate to use such figures. I would guess that a Palestinian rabbi would have con sidered equating the patriarchs with athletes offensive.</page><page sequence="81">[81] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 231 Philo tells us that allegorically Isaac is the symbol of natural perfection, while Jacob and Abraham are symbols of perfection attained, in the former by practice, in the latter by being taught. These three "methods," natural endowment, practice, and teaching were by Philo's time a commonplace in Greek philo sophical thought. The patriarchs, accordingly, are allegorically illustrations of the three types of perfection; that is to say, Philo sets forth his views on the Greek problem of attaining perfection through the medium of the patriarchs.25 The literal patriarchs are of one house and one family, father, son and grandson. They have it in common that they are God lovers and God-beloved. In recognition of their virtues God makes these partners in a title, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.26 The outstanding quality of Abraham is his piety (6ύσ6/3αα). He is zealous to follow God; he wants to obey the divine com mands. These commands, Philo insists, are not only such as are conveyed in speech and writing;27 these commands are also such as are made manifest by nature, and apprehended by the sense which is superior to hearing: sight or contemplation. Any one who contemplates the order in nature and the constitution of the cosmos needs no teacher.28 Abraham, then, is one who "con 25 See Wolfson, II, 196 ff. on the background. I discuss this more fully below, page 263. 26 Abr. 49—51. Philo uses Ex. 3.15, as a proof text. In the passage he goes on to assert, briefly, that this is a "relative" title, not an "absolute" one. Elsewhere (Mut. 12 f.) Philo gives a longer explanation, that God is in actu ality nameless; titles such as Theos and Kyrios describe aspects of deity, not actual deity. Here he compresses the comment, adding only that the relative name is one suited to men so that they can have a name to which to address their prayers. See also QG, III, 39. Philo next proceeds to foreshadow the allegorical interpretations of the patriarchs, Abr. 56-59. 27 Above, Abr. 5, Philo has told us that as yet particular laws had not been set in writing; later, Abr. 275, Philo repeats that Abraham knew no written laws. Philo is not here saying that Abraham observed written laws; he is saying that commands are not only written laws, they are also unwritten commands. The passage, thus viewed, is not in contradiction with 5 and 275. 28 Abr. 60-61. The implied contradiction, that is, the lack of need of a teacher, and Abraham as the symbol of perfection through being taught, is Philo's. The contradiction is more apparent than real, for to Philo the true wisdom, beyond mere knowledge, is revealed, not taught.</page><page sequence="82">232 SAMUEL SANDMEL [82] templates," and thereby, he leads a life which carries out the laws of nature. The divine commands which Abraham obeys are the natural law abiding with the peaceful life; it tends towards the assimilation of the beauties of nature. Philo will now illustrate from Scripture Abraham's piety (in observing the law of nature). Philo paraphrases Gen. 12, making some significant substitutions and adding some significant fea tures. He turns Gen. 12.1, "God said to Abraham" into "under the force of an oracle."29 The motive behind this alteration is probably Philo's unwillingness to portray God as talking to a man; this would imply "hearing," whereas God, insofar as He is knowable, is known through sight (of the soul). The para phrase permits Philo to avoid the anthropomorphism implied in Scripture, and yet to retain God as the motivator of Abraham's departure. Philo says laconically that Abraham is to seek a new home; he makes no mention of the biblical words "to the land which I shall show thee." This, we shall see, is no oversight, but a delib erate, indeed a necessary omission. Abraham, he tells us, is like someone going home from a strange land and not like some one going to a strange land from home.30 The divine oracle, then, is having the effect of bringing Abraham not to a strange land but "home."31 The emigration, Philo adds, is one of soul rather than of body; heavenly love overpowers Abraham's desire for mortal things.32 The Scriptural patriarch who moved with family and flocks is replaced by the Sage who makes a journey of soul not to a new land, but home. Scripture relates that Abraham takes Sarah and Lot with him ; such company would be natural for a bodily trip. But in this trip of the soul, Philo appropriately reduces Abraham's companions to an equivocal "few" and then 29 λογίω πληχθίίς. נ° Abr. 62. 1נ Philo hints here at a notion he often states specifically elsewhere; God does not permit the virtue-lover to dwell in the body, as in his own native land, but only to sojourn in it as in a foreign country, Heres 267 ff.; QG III, 10, interpreting Gen. 15.13; and &lt;26 III, 45, on Gen. 17.8. This is a common Stoic sentiment. 2נ Abr. 66.</page><page sequence="83">[83] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 233 further reduces it promptly to a lonely departure.33 The mystic journey is necessarily lonely; this tiny item, unparalleled in the rabbis, is a key to Philo's unique view of Abraham. Philo tells us that Abraham hastens to obey, since he con siders quickness in executing the command to be as much to be honored as full accomplishment.34 Philo has preceded his statement that Abraham's migration was one of soul rather than one of body by a digression on leaving home. The effect of this digression is to build up a contrast of other migrators with Abraham. Others leave home as a result of banishment, or for business, but their ties to home are so strong that when possible they return. Abraham, however, leaves for good. These others are examples of those who emigrate in body; Abraham, however, migrated in soul. "Home," in the sense of "his father's house," seems by implication to be equal in Philo's mind with bodily matters; he makes no such direct statement in this passage, but the words seem to me to be quite pointed in that direction.35 By his digression, Philo has built a clear picture of other migrants,363 with the result that his reverting to Abraham in contrast is all the more striking.36b But, having stated that it is a migration of soul, Philo pro ceeds to give a list of "bodily" things which Abraham leaves. The Bible mentioned only "thy land, thy birth-place, and thy father's house."37 Philo expands the list to include fellow-tribes men, wards-men, schoolmates, comrades, blood-relatives, ancient 3333 μετ' ολίγων ... η και μόνος. 3434 Abr. 66. The rabbis too extol Abraham for departing immediately Mid. Ps.Ps. CXIX, 3 and frequently. The words of Scripture "Abraham went, as God commanded him" (Gen. 12.4) suggest an immediate departure; it is unnecessary to suppose a dependence here of Philo on the rabbis or the rabbis on Philo. The inference of an immediate departure is a natural one. I find no rabbinic parallel to "quickness in executing to be as much to be honored as full accomplishment." 3־ So especially Abr. 63. A fuller-discussion is found in Mig. 2 ff. There "house" is "speech," that is, "uttered thought" which is inferior to unuttered thought. See below, notes 281 and 285. 36a Abr. 63-66. 36t Abr. 66 ff. 3' Gen. 12.1.</page><page sequence="84">234 SAMUEL SANDMEL [84] customs, society, and social intercourse.38 These terms suggest that Philo is describing what a man in his own day would leave behind in migrating. The references to wards-men, schoolmates, and social intercourse suggest that Philo conceives of Abraham as a compatriot of Philo leaving his native Alexandria. We shall see in other passages that Philo tends to make an Alexandrian of Abraham. The divine oracle of Gen. 12 seems to have come, according to Philo, in Ur of the Chaldees, rather than in Haran, as Gen. 11 implies. Rabbinic tradition assigns the call to Haran.39 Some now lost oral tradition may• lie behind the assignment of the call to Chaldea; but it is possible that the notion rests on Neh. 9.740 and not on oral tradition. The verse states that God brought Abraham out of Chaldea; it conflicts with Gen. 11.31, which tells us that Terah brought Abraham out. Once he has mentioned Chaldea and Haran41 with their phys ical properties which would make Abraham's migration one of body, Philo promptly turns to allegory. Abraham is allegorically the virtue-loving soul seeking the true God.42 The Chaldeans glorify visible existence and they take no notice of invisible and intelligible existence. They conclude that the universe itself is God.43 Philo has already told us that Abraham is a believer in God; he has already told us of Abraham's apprehension by the highest of the senses.44 The Abraham we have hitherto met is poles apart from the Chaldean creed,45 but, now, when we en counter Abraham, he has been, as yet, in Chaldea, in materialistic pantheism. He has long been reared in this creed,46 but recog nizing its falsity he abandons it. As a result, he discerns that 38 A br. 67. 3י Cf. Ginzberg, V, 219. 40 A possible objection to this explanation is that we do not have any quotation by Philo of Neh. 9.7. 41 Abr. 67. 4242 Abr. 68 43 Abr. 69. 44 Abr. 60. 45 See below, note 261. This creed is often assumed to be Stoicism but it is more likely that it is astral determination. 46 Abr. 69.</page><page sequence="85">[85] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 235 there is a God in the universe. He has begun to abandon Chaldea, pantheism, in favor of an incipient theism; as Philo puts it, he has opened his soul's eye and begun to see the pure beam instead of the deep darkness; following the ray, he discerns what he had not beheld before, a charioteer and pilot presiding over the world.47 Philo now tells us precisely how Abraham proceeds to recog nize the existence of God. He has abandoned a preoccupation with the material universe. Instead he turns to study himself as a microcosm,48 and as a result he will learn about the macro 47 Abr. 70. The passage contains an aspect which is of interest beyond its content. Philo begins it by an explicit statement that he is turning to allegory. In the allegory Abraham is the virtue-loving soul. But promptly, as though he had forgotten that he was in allegory, Philo reverts from the soul to Abraham. If we were to limit Philo to a rigid distinction between the literal and the allegorical, we should conclude that here Philo has broken his allegorical figure. But such a comment, though justifiable, is superficial. It is true that Abraham is allegorized as the soul (or, elsewhere, as the mind). Philo, however, deals with the person, Abraham, in two supplementary ways. There was the Abraham who migrated from Ur to Haran; there was also the Abraham who departed from materialistic pantheism. When pressed to it, we might explain that it is the mind rather than the person which abandons such a thing as pantheism. There are other passages in which the distinction between the mind of a person like Abraham and the person himself is rigidly drawn by Philo. For example, he tells us in several places that the allegorical Isaac is not a man; he tells us at the end of Congress, that neither Sarah nor Hagar is a woman. In some passages, then, the content is such that Philo feels impelled to go beyond only saying that he deals in allegory, but clearly he insists that he is not dealing with people. In other passages, those labeled literal ones, he gives clear over-tones of allegorical connotations, but the humanity of his pro tagonists is tenaciously held on to. But there are not infrequent passages like the present one where there emerges what seems to me to be the tendency most peculiar to Philo: to keep a double interpretation in as neat a conjunction as possible whenever he can. 48 Philo is here far removed from the rabbis who ascribe to Abraham a knowledge of the existence of God from viewing the material world, and the deduction that a power lies behind it. Such a view is present in Philo, but attributed to the lesser Bezalel, who knows of the existence of God from created things by a process of reasoning, contrasted with Moses who receives the clear vision of God directly from the first cause, LA III, 102; cf. Wolfson, II, 83-84. I touch on this difference in "Abraham's Knowledge of the Exist ence of God," HTR, XLIV, 1951, 137-139. On Josephus, see above, note 228 in Chapter II.</page><page sequence="86">236 SAMUEL SANDMEL [86] cosm. Philo argues that since there is a mind in man appointed as ruler, which all the community of the body obeys and each of the senses follows, the world, which is the most beautiful, the greatest, and most perfect of all, must also have a ruler; and just as the mind in man is invisible, so is the ruler of the world. One who reflects on these things need not concern himself with distant things (such as sun, moon, and stars) but only with him self. Accordingly, Abraham turns to examine himself.■9 Haran, "sense perception," is the process or point at which Abraham examines his own nature, instead of examining the material world. The proof that Abraham migrated from "astrology," Philo tells us, is that "God was seen by Abraham."30 This is a proof text, he avers, that God was not manifest to him before, while he was still in Chaldean pantheism.51 Our Abraham, then, has been summarized succinctly as a sage who turned from materialistic pantheism to the recognition of God, and as a result received the vision of God. This turning, Philo goes on to say, is attested by the alteration of Abraham's name; Abram is the meteorologist; Abraham is the Sage.52 The meteorologist sees nothing greater than the universe; the sage sees, through his mind, the ruler and governor.55 But Haran was only the first migration. A second takes place, Philo tells us, into the wilderness.54 Abraham wanders about with out complaining of the wandering and the insecurity. He has not « Abr. 73-75. 50 Philo says this takes place (ΰθύς, Abr. 77. Colson seems troubled that apparently the vision of God takes place "in Haran," whereas the text alio cates the vision to Canaan, Gen. 12.7. I show, in my section on the allegorical Abraham, that there are actually many stages between Haran, "sense per ception," and the vision of God. Philo leaps over these stages here, but else where makes clear that the vision is the result of a quite lengthy process. s' The force of Xoyiw πληχθίίς above, Abr. 62, now becomes more ap parent; the words "God said to Abraham," which Philo avoids, do not mean to him a manifestation of God to Abraham while he is still Abram. s' I discuss the change of names in the allegorical Abraham, below, notes 278-279. 53 Abr. 82-84. 54 LXX Gen. 12.9.

While others might have been tempted to retrace their steps, Abraham alone is content; he thinks no life is as pleasant as one lived without association with the multitude. Philo's intent is perfectly clear here, though his statement is shorter than the same motif in other passages.56 Solitude is the setting in which union with God takes place; as God is alone, solitude is precious to God, so that he who seeks God must make himself like God, a dweller in solitude.57 It cannot be over-emphasized that Philo has little or no con cern for Palestine. As we shall see, the Land of Canaan is "adolescence" and its vices. In our context he seems deliberately to avoid the biblical verses which enjoin Abraham to migrate to Canaan, and he selects as the goal of the second migration of Abraham not the land flowing in milk and honey but, as we see, an entirely different place, mentioned in a relatively minor verse in the LXX text. The focus on this verse by Philo is no accident. It is a deliberate and judicious selection. Abraham, he is telling us, abandons pantheism, begins to examine himself and comes to theism, and promptly seeks out solitude as a means of seeing God. This verse, then, is a crucial one in Philo's Abraham, for it is one of the striking statements in this treatise of Abraham's mysticism. Abraham, the man, Philo tells us in a summary,58 draws away from his old associations; his mind does not remain in falsity (Chaldean pantheism) or in the world of the senses (Haran), but it speeds upwards by means of reason (λογισμω) to the nature which is superior to the visible world, and to God, the maker and ruler of both the visible and the intelligible world. Philo has depicted Abraham in general outlines. He turns now to recount, within that framework, specific deeds which, he says, call for anything but contempt. First he tells of the incident of 55 Philo here again seems to conceive of Abraham as an Alexandrian, now far from the city, wandering in the wilderness. 56 The motif of separation from the hub-bub of the city and its somewhat contemptible multitudes is frequent in Philo, " Abr. 87. s8 Abr. 88.</page><page sequence="88">238 SAMUEL SANDMEL [88] Abraham's sojourn in Egypt and of the incident of Pharaoh and of Sarah. Philo alludes to Abraham as the friend of God (φι.\ό 6eos).s9 Philo feels it necessary to supply an explanatory preface. From the Genesis account, one might possibly infer that the great patriarch was something of a prevaricator, and that Phar aoh acted innocently. Philo's telling of the story, however, makes Abraham clearly the hero and Pharaoh clearly the villain. As though conceding that the story is susceptible of a wrong inter pretation, Philo tells us prefatorily that Abraham's greatness in the incident is not clear to everyone, but only to those who have tasted virtue and who scorn what the multitudes prefer.60 Philo" we shall see, does two things with the incident: he recasts it in tone and import, and then he allegorizes it. Abraham's marriage is threatened, Philo tells us, but as a reward for the deeds related above, God keeps the marriage safe and unharmed.61 As Philo recounts the incident, he adds certain details of a naturalistic character which are not present in the Bible. There has been a considerable period of crop failure. The crop failure extends, it would seem, over periods of both excessive rainfall and periods of drought. Philo adds also that Abraham is not the only resident of Syria who leaves there to seek food.62 On the other hand, Philo is careful to point out that the supply of corn in Egypt, for materialistic reasons, was plentiful.63 Philo tells the story without mentioning by name either Sarah or the king of Egypt.64 Abraham's wife is distinguished in beauty, both of body and of soul. The chief people of Egypt65 see her, 59 Abr. 89. On the epithet and problems attendant, see above, Chapter II, note 130, and below, note 347. 60 Abr. 89. 61 Abr. 88-90. 62 Abr. 91. Philo's motive in these additions is to justify Abraham's going to Egypt. 6נ Abr. 91-92. 64 Throughout the treatise Philo refrains from naming names such as Lot and Melchizedek. The names might have been meaningless to a Gentile audience.

As the Bible tells the story, the chiefs send Sarah to Pharaoh; in Philo's account Pharaoh sends for Sarah. The king's action, Philo avers, paid little regard to decency, or to the laws enacted to to show respect to strangers. The allusion seems unmistakably contemporaneous and apologetic, reflecting the status of Jews, or the popular regard of them, in Alexandrian law and Egyptian sentiment.67 Pharaoh determines to take Sarah in marriage only nominally; his real motive is to give rein to his license and to bring her to shame. The contemporaneous note is retained by Philo as he continues the narrative; Sarah, in a foreign country and at the mercy of a despot, joins with her helpless husband in fleeing to God. God has pity on the strangers and he punishes the king, in both body and soul, with plagues. The household, undoubtedly an allusion to Gentile Alexandrians, fail to show indignation at the outrage, and by consenting, are almost accomplices; therefore they, too, feel the plague. The sanctity of Abraham's marriage is preserved, and from it there is born the nation dearest to God which has received the gift of priesthood and prophecy on behalf of all mankind.68 Philo has omitted from his account Abraham's request of Sarah that she call herself Abraham's sister; he makes no mention of the gifts given by Pharaoh; and, significantly, he omits Phar aoh's sending Abraham out of Egypt. As Philo has told the story, a consummately evil Egyptian king has violated all laws of decency toward a stranger, the progenitor of the Jews. "י Rabbinic legends tell of Sarah's being put in a box by Abraham; she is discovered by tax collectors. Stein, Philo u. der Midrasch, 27, note 2, believes that réXti of Philo is an allusion to tax collectors, and thereby an allusion to the legend which Stein says comes from "der alteren, hellenistischen Agada." This seems to me to be a quite ingenious and implausible explanation. Yonge renders the phrase "Egyptian magistrates," while Colson renders it "chief people of Egypt." 6' Cf. Flaccum 29 and 53-54, and elsewhere, 1,8 Abr. 93-98.</page><page sequence="90">240 SAMUEL SANDMEL [90] Philo now allegorizes the incident. The allegory, he tells us, is not original with him; he has heard it from "natural philoso phers." The allegory retains Abraham as the good mind and makes Sarah into generic virtue, and the king, the body-loving mind. The literal interpretation contrasted men, the decent Abraham, and the inhospitable Pharaoh ; the allegory is a contrast between the character of genuine virtue and the pretense. Abraham's virtue is genuine. Philo proceeds with his contrast; he turns now to show Abraham's hospitality,69 in sharp antithesis to that of the Egyp tian. The basis is the narrative in Gen. 18 of the three strangers. Abraham sees three travelers, whose divine nature is not apparent to him. He runs to them and offers his hospitality. The travelers promptly accept because they recognize by Abraham's warmth even more than by his words that they are welcome. They enter his tent.70 Abraham's soul is filled with joy. He bids Sarah to bake three measures of cakes in the ashes.71 He himself hurries to the stalls to select a tender calf for a servant to kill and dress.72 Philo pauses to tell that all this is done with speed, for in a wise man's home no one is slow in showing kindness, but women and men, freemen and slaves are full of zeal to serve guests.73 "י QG IV, 10 infers from Gen. 18.8 that despite his 318 slaves (Gen. 14.4) Abraham himself waited on the guests; somewhat similarly, though without mention of these slaves, BM 86b. 70 LXX speaks of a tent. Later in this passage Philo will allude to the dwelling as oIkos. Perhaps it is not alone the biblical context but also the suggestion of wilderness implicit in the word "tent"; the passage is to be used allegorically for a mystic experience. Josephus portrays Abraham at the portal of his "court"; see Chapter II, note 287. 71 This is based on LXX Gen. 18.6, which adds "in the ashes." Elsewhere, Sac.Sac. 59-60, Philo infers an allegory from the cakes, which, buried in the ashes, are like the true mysteries, buried, and not revealed. The allegory requires the LXX reading and is impossible on the MT. See below, note 364. 72 Philo omits mentioning the dairy dishes of Gen. 18.8; possibly Philo himself observed the prohibition developed in rabbinic law regarding meat and dairy dishes. Possibly, however, the omission is not deliberate, but a result of Philo's compressing the story, in writing from memory. "The "slave and free" give the passage a contemporaneous touch; it seems to be an Alexandrian allusion, possibly to the ideal of Philo's own household.</page><page sequence="91">[91] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 241 The guests feed on the good will of the host rather than on viands.74 The guests promise him a son born in wedlock. The promise is spoken through one of the guests, the highest.75 Abra ham and Sarah consider the promise incredible. Philo excuses Sarah's denial of her laughter by attributing to Sarah the gist of verse 14 that nothing is impossible to God; in the Bible the verse is spoken by God.76 Sarah, Philo adds, had known this truth from the cradle. As Philo ends the incident, it is rounded off by this exculpation of Sarah. In the Bible, it ends abruptly without any exculpation of Sarah. Philo adds that Sarah sees in the strangers a different and grander aspect, that of prophets or angels, transformed from their spiritual and soul-like nature into human shape.77 So far Philo has told the story as a contrast to the king of Egypt. But his main thesis at the moment is Abraham's piety, and he now asserts that the hospitality is a by-product of that greater virtue. The piety is clearly seen, says Philo, even if we think of the strangers as men. It is a happy and blessed house if wise men halt there. How much happier and more blessed it is if the travelers are angels of God sent to announce God's predic tions to men.78 With overtones of allegory, Philo asks the rhetorical question, 74 Philo below denies more specifically than the hint here, that the travelers ate. '575 The text varies from the singular to the plural. Modern scholarship explains the changes as due to different sources. The text states (Gen. 18.1) that Yahweh appears to Abraham; Abraham sees three men; he runs to them. He addresses "them" in the singular in 18.3, but in the plural in 18.4-5. They are plural again in 8-9, but abruptly singular in 10. In 13 the text reverts to Yahweh. The problem of pre-modern interpreters was to harmonize the passage so as to equate, in some way, Yahweh and the three men. Both Philo and the rabbis arrive at such equations. It is not necessary to suppose dependency on anything beyond the difficulties of the text. The rabbis equate the men with three specific angels. Philo equates them with "powers" of God. The similarity is that both Philo and the rabbis resolve the difficulty; the dissimilarity is the manner in which they resolve it. 76 See QG IV, 17, on Gen. 18.13-14, where Philo conforms to the biblical account, but interprets quite congruently with the present passage. 77 Abr. 107-113. The material appears also in QG IV, 16-17. 78 Abr. 114-115.</page><page sequence="92">242 SAMUEL SANDMEL [92] how could the angels have entered the house if they had not known that all the household, like a well-ordered crew, were obedient to the pilot?79 Abraham is a kinsman and fellow servant of the angels;80 all of them are servants who seek refuge with the master.81 Since they are angels, they neither eat nor drink, though they give the appearance of it.82 Yet even this is secondary to the greater miracle that, though immaterial, they assume human form as an act of grace to the man of worth. The miracle occurs to cause the sage to perceive that God recognizes what kind of man he is.83 By turning the foregoing into allegory, Philo is enabled to as sess the incident in terms of Abraham's spiritual development, ft is the vision of God achieved by the mind. The mind uninitiated into sacred mysteries is able to apprehend God only through God's creative or ruling aspects, whereas the initiated mind, when purified, sees God as one.84 The variations between the singular and the plural in Gen. 18 are proof that the three and 'י'י The figure recalls the passage in Abr. 73-74, the mind is the ruler (or pilot) of the members of the body, the senses and the passions. The thought implicit is that as wise men will enter a household well conducted by its ruler, so will the divine appearances come into the mind controlling the household of the body. 80 This comes close to suggesting that Abraham is not a man. Philo does not, however, ever get quite that far. The passage occasions some difficulty when it is later allegorized, Abr. 143, in that Philo declares one of the angels to be To On', how, then, could To On be a fellow-servant of Abraham? See Wolfson, I, 379-380. The true difficulty is, I believe, the assumption on the part of Gfrôrer and Wolfson that Philo is rigidly consistent; Philo is not. He can, therefore, in Abr. 115, call the visitors angels, and kinsmen of Abraham and fellow-servants with him; and he can allegorize them in 143 as To On and the Two Powers. 81 Abr. 116. 82 Similarly, see QG IV, 9, on Gen. 18.8. There Philo adds that the pious and worthy life of a virtuous man is figuratively the food of God. With Colson, VI, p. 598, I believe that the "Docetic" question of angels' eating is a matter of the larger framework of angelological speculations; there is no need to believe that Josephus, Ant. I, XI, 2, is dependent on this passage in Philo; see page 188. The rabbis, too, declare that the angels only appeared to eat, though a late midrash denounces those who deny the eating; cf.

Abraham belongs to the best class of temperaments.86 The incident of the three travelers, then, is not only an instance of Abraham's achieving the mystic goal, it is a demonstration that Abraham belongs to the best class of those who receive the mystic vision.87 Abraham's distinction in belonging to the best class is made clearer, Philo tells us, in the story of Sodom.88 We shall see that the long story eventually returns to this main point and its inclusion in the treatise rests on the contrast it supplies between the grades of mystic vision, the sight of God as one or as three. First Philo summarizes the story. Sodom was full of innumerable indignities, particularly such as arise from gluttony89 and lewd ness. The license stemmed from the great wealth of Sodom;90 excess prosperity, Philo says in quoting from Menander, is the principal beginning of evils. The Sodomites threw off the law of nature; they drank strong liquor, fed on delicacies, and practiced forbidden forms of intercourse. Homosexuality led to effeminacy not only in body but also in soul. Had these practices spread to Greeks and barbarians, depopulation would have turned cities into deserts.91 Divine punishment in the form of the rain of fire consumed all that was above ground and even penetrated into the earth itself. The fire92 was still burning in his own time, Philo tells us; it continues to burn or at least to smoulder. 8s Abr. 131-132. 86 Abr. 124-125. 87 I discuss this allegory of Gen. 18 below, page 302. Here, I try to point out no more than the significance of the section as a whole. 88 Abr. 133. 89 The rabbinic indictment of Sodom includes murder, lack of pity, and homosexuality, San. 109a and Tar. Jon. to Gen. 13.13, but lacks gluttony. I have found no passages in Philo specifically abjuring eating for sensual pleasure. Philo, who countenanced sexual intercourse for purposes of procréa tion but not for pleasure (below Abr. 137 and Abr. 253), countenanced eating to sustain life, but not eating for pleasure. A fuller description and denuncia tion of "Sodomites" is found in Somn. II, 61-64. See also V. C. 48 and notes 154 and 403. 90 This is probably based on Gen. 13.10. 91 Abr. 133-136. 92 Abr. 137-140. The burning, and not the "over-turning," LXX Gen. 19.25, claims Philo's attention.</page><page sequence="94">244 SAMUEL SANDMEL [94] The details thus compressed,93 Philo is ready to demonstrate how the narrative proved Abraham's eminence in mystic capaci ties. While three men appeared to Abraham in Gen. 18, only two of them, according to Scripture, Gen. 19, went on to Sodom. Of the five cities of Sodom, Gen. 14.2, four were destroyed, but one was preserved.94 The two men represent the two potencies95 of God, the beneficial and the punitive. The virtue of the pre served city,96 was not complete and perfect; it received benefits through a potency of God, but it was not worthy of the direct vision of Him.97 The contrast, then, is between the progressing mind which saw only an aspect of God, and Abraham who saw God Himself. But Philo has not yet finished with his point. He now goes into a deeper explanation. The five cities of Sodom are the five senses in us: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. The last three are animal senses; hearing is above these, but is feminine, 91 Philo omits here the bargaining of Abraham and all mention of Lot and his family. 4י See below, notes 104 and 265. 's In rabbinic legends, the three angels of Gen. 18 had these tasks, one task for each : Michael, to give good tidings to Sarah ; Raphael to heal Abraham who has just been circumcised (Gen. 17); and Gabriel to overturn Sodom. The rabbis elsewhere identify one of Lot's two visitors as Michael; there is some squirming at the necessity of giving Michael, against all the rules of angels, an additional mission of saving Lot, B. M. 86b and Tan. Wa-yera XX. There is some accord between Philo and the rabbis in the notion that God Himself is not the immediate source of evil; cf. Ginzberg V, 5 and 241. Ginz berg accounts for this similarity of motif by suggesting that Philo has here given a philosophical turn to a popular motif, while Freudenthal, op. cit., I, 70, believes that the rabbis are dependent on Philo. However similar the motif, there are differences in the mode of expressing it; further, there is this minor difference that the rabbis regard Lot as the object of Michael's saving, while Philo regards the city So'ar as the object of the saving by the beneficial potency. My own judgment would be that both midrashim are readily de ducible from the Bible, which equates God and the three angels in Gen. 18.1, and sends two of the "men" on to Sodom in Gen. 19. Philo and the rabbis are related here only through the coincidence of a scriptural opportunity for exegesis; the saving angels of the rabbis and the beneficial potencies are independently developed midrashim. 6י Or, possibly of Lot who fled there! " Abr. 142-146.</page><page sequence="95">[95] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 245 and lower than sight, the supreme sense.98 Philo dwells on the importance of sight as the best of the senses,99 and the benefits it provides. But the vital part of sight is that on it alone of the senses God made light shine, and light is the best of existing things. Light has a double nature. First, in common use, it is the effulgence of fire and disappears when the fire is quenched. Second, light which comes from the heavens, as the light of stars, is unquenchable and imperishable.100 The eyes, using light, con template the earth and its contents, and even heaven itself.101 The eyes leave earth and in an instant reach heaven; they draw the understanding to the observation of what they have seen.102 The understanding takes sight as its starting point, and proceeds to the fundamental questions of the existence of a creator, of His essence and quality of His purpose.103 The preserved city is sight,104 which was preserved because it avoided the slavery to flesh and the senses to which the other four succumbed. Sight yearns to survey the entire heaven and the universe.105 Philo now turns to what he regards as Abraham's greatest action, the story of the offering of Isaac, based on Gen. 22. Isaac is a child of great bodily beauty and excellence of virtue. His perfection of virtues is beyond his years,106 so that Abraham loves him not only with the usual love of a father for a son, but «8 A br. 147-150. יי יי יי Abr. 151-154• Abr. 155-158• 101 Abr. 159• 102 Abr. 161. 103 Note must be made again of the difficulties which Philo provides his interpreters in his allegorical pursuits. In his recounting of Gen. 18, he states that the three men were allegoricatty To On and the Powers: here he alludes to an exactly similar explanation, carrying further the explanation already begun, as the natural and obvious rendering for the multitude. Now that this is over, he will expound a hidden and inward meaning. 104 Colson, VI, 82-3 points out the dependency of this passage, and a parallel Opif. 54, on Timaeus 47A. Philo argues that the city is described as both small and not small; hence it must be "sight." Philo, as Colson points out VI, p. 84, does a little violence to the verse, Gen. 19.20. See note 2. 108 Abr. 162-166. 106 Allegorically, Isaac represents elsewhere natural perfection, as distinct from perfection through learning (Abraham) or through practice (Jacob) ; cf. Abr. 52.</page><page sequence="96">246 SAMUEL SANDMEL [96] also as one who admires worthy qualities of character. Suddenly and to his surprise107 there comes to Abraham the divine message that he should sacrifice Isaac on a certain lofty hill108 which, Philo tells us, was as much as a three days' journey from the city.109 Despite his love for his son, Abraham shows at this com mand neither a change of color nor a weakening of soul, but remains steadfast as ever, and does not waver.110 Mastered by his love for God, he overcomes family affection.111 He tells no one in his household of the divine call,112 but sets out.115 He takes with him only two servants114 of his numerous following. When Abraham sees the appointed place115 from afar off, he bids his 10י There is no biblical basis for "suddenly and surprisingly." Gen. 22.1, begins "It came to pass after these things." The rabbis speculated on what the antecedent of "these" was, and found the answer to be the quarrels which they say arose between Ishmael and Isaac; or Satan's complaint to God that Abraham has offered no sacrifices; San. 89b and Gen. R. LV. 108 Philo makes no mention of Moriah. The rabbis and Josephus identify Moriah as the mount on which the Temple was to stand, on the basis of II Chron. 3.1. 1°9 Again Philo reveals that he regards Abraham as a city dweller like himself. , 1,0 This seems clearly a reminiscence of Gen. 22.1, in which God tested Abraham. Philo omits the explicit word "test." The notion may have been repugnant to him. Jubilees and the rabbis, on the other hand, increase the tests from this single biblical mention to lists of ten tests. 111 So, too, IV Macc. XIV, 20. 112 The rabbis portray him as telling Sarah that he is taking Isaac to school, Tar.Tar. Jon. to Gen. 22.3. 1" Scripture specifies that Abraham arose early in the morning, but Philo omits this, and also the saddling of the ass. 114 LXX renders נעריו by παϊδας. Philo paraphrases the idea, but uses the word depaxeias. No great violence is done to MT when the rabbis infer that the "boys" are Ishmael and Eliezer, Tar. Jon. ad loc. But Ishmael would hardly qualify as a "servant." One would infer that Philo did not know this widely appearing midrash. The Greek word xcus can mean either boy or servant; Philo clearly understands the passage to mean servants, while the rabbis took it as boys. 115 Philo initially speaks of the appointed area as χώροι', Abr. 171, but promptly alludes to it, like LXX, as roxos. This latter is in Philo a euphemism for God, like the rabbinic המקום. A mystic background is passingly alluded to in the words "They walked with equal speed of mind rather than body ..." Philo developes this with some fullness in Mig. 166 f. I treat this below, p. 294.</page><page sequence="97">[97] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 247 servants to stay where they are,116 while he and Isaac proceed.117 He gives Isaac the fire118 and the wood to carry; since these are a burden of piety, it is a light burden. They walk, Philo tells us, with equal speed of mind, rather than of body,119 along the road which is holiness, and they arrive at the appointed place.120 By these little touches, Philo has indi cated that there is something more to the story than only the obedience of a Sage. The story is an example again of Abraham's mystical experience. But Philo in this context does no more than give tantalizing allusions. Philo continues his narrative with the building of the altar. He reports Isaac's question regarding the victim, and he tells us that Abraham does not swerve, in visage or thought, though someone else might have been moved by emotion to tears or to silence. Abraham avoids both pitfalls, and replies that God will supply the victim. This will take place even though they are in the wide wilderness;121 God will 116 Jubilees XVIII, 4 supplies a well for the servants. 117 Another touch to set the stage for Abr. 190. 118 Isaac does not carry the fire in Genesis. This appears to be one of several lapses of memory which justify the conclusion that Philo does not have Genesis open before him in writing the treatise. "י Gen. 22.8, states that they journeyed together. In the allegory, in which Abraham is the mind perfected through learning and Isaac the mind naturally perfect, Philo uses the verse to show that ultimately the perfection of Abraham, though an acquired one, equalled the natural perfection of Isaac, Mig.Mig. 166 f.; see below, page 294. The entire thought of Abr. 172 is dependent on the allegory which Philo does not here reproduce, but which is clearly hinted at. 120 As pointed out above, allegory underlies the pericope. The "place" is God in the allegory, and hence the road is a holy one. Philo apparently sees three things in the events of Gen. 22. First, the literal story. Second, the mystic road to God traversed together by the naturally perfect and the one perfected by teaching. Third, as in Abr. 200-204, the willingness of the Sage to sacrifice his joy to God. It is not unusual in Philo, that a biblical character is allegorized in related but somewhat different ways; Isaac represents both Abraham's "joy" and also the soul which is perfect by nature. 121 There is nothing in Genesis to justify Philo's calling the "place" an ίρημία. We saw above, page 236, that Abraham's second migration, a mystic one, was to the wilderness, Philo's mysticism seems to be the basis for the intrusion of this rather surprising word.</page><page sequence="98">248 SAMUEL SANDMEL [98] even here do what is called for, for all things are possible to Him.1" Abraham puts Isaac on the altar.123 He has the drawn knife in his right124 hand, prepared to deal the death blow. God the Savior stops the deed halfway, with a voice from the air.125 He orders Abraham not to touch the lad. In this way the slaughter is prevented126 and Isaac is saved. God repays Abraham's piety by returning the offering which piety intended. While the action does not come to the intended ending, it is complete and per feet.127 So Philo terminates the account, without as much as a mention of the ram of Gen. 22.13.128 The narrative as presented has accorded with Philo's treat ment noted in the earlier episodes. The subject Philo is discussing is still Abraham's piety. As in the case of the call to migrate, Philo has turned the biblical phrase "God said" into a divine message (λόγων). As before, Abraham obeys promptly. As before, though considerably less explicitly, the literal journey enjoined is conceived of again, in its own way, as a journey to a 122 Abr. 175. 123 Philo omits mentioning here that Isaac is bound. The rabbis use the term "binding," עקדה as the prime word in alluding to Gen. 22. The rabbis embellish the story with many details, especially after Isaac is bound. Philo passes over the item as though this aspect was of little importance to him. "4 Philo adds this. 125 Genesis says the voice comes from heaven. 126 Abr. 176. 12' Abr. 177. 128 The rabbis, as noted above, page 193, identified Moriah as the place of the Temple. For them there was, accordingly, no difficulty in the thought that Abraham offered a sacrifice, so, impliedly, it was offered at the proper place. Philo makes no such identification; he fails to mention the ram. It may be conjectured that the omission stems from the fact that Alexandrian Jews did not offer animal sacrifices in Alexandria, but only when they came to Jerusalem. With such worship unusual for them, Philo may have felt no great and pressing need for it, and therefore he is disposed to pass over the incident of the ram. In here omitting the ram, Philo omits also the motif of the ram's horn, the atoning power of which is of frequent mention in rabbinic writings, and which is regarded as basic to the use of the ram's horn on Rosh Hashanah. Cf. R. H. 15a; Pal. Ta'an. II, 4-5, Tan. Wa-yera XLVI. In Fuga 132 ff. the ram of Gen. 22.13, held in a Σαβίκ shrub (so LXX handles סבך), is reason "keeping quiet" in suspense of judgment on matters lacking proof.</page><page sequence="99">[99] THILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 249 mystic goal. Philo has again dealt freely (perhaps even capri ciously) with the biblical narrative, omitting certain details which could not or would not fit into his theme. The allegory of the episode tells how a Sage, in obedience to a divine command, leaves his city, unobtrusively and unnoticed, to go into the wilderness alone, to commune with God. We can only guess at the motives which impelled Philo so to abridge the biblical account. Elsewhere"» he utilizes some of the portions here omitted and these could easily be fitted into his scheme. It is to be noted that the abridged ending is followed by a high polemical defense of Abraham against detractors.1·'0 The impression can be gotten that Philo's eagerness for the attack is what had led him to abbreviate the narrative. The attack is directed against those whom Philo describes as φι,Χαπίχθήμοντες who misconstrue everything. He alludes to the βασκανία and πι,κρία of these critics.131 He urges them to "set bolt and bar to their unbridled evil-speaking mouths, control their envy and hatred, and not mar the virtues of men who have lived a good life."132 These are not the calm words of a detached and remote mystic, but the angry words of a man provoked by some real situation. It is difficult to identify unmistakably these opponents who find Abraham less than unique.133 It is usually assumed that we have here a reminiscence of some topic about which was focused some polemical and apologetic interchange between anti-Semites and Jews.134 My own thought is that Philo's targets are fellow Jews of an "assimilationist" character. Philo's opponents contend that other people have sacrificed their children, to save the country in war or in drouth; Philo concedes this to be true, but he denies that such deeds actually 129 Quod Deus 4, Fuga 132 and LA III, 203. 130 Abr. 178 ff. 131 Abr. 184. 132 Abr. 191. 133 Abr. 179 ff. 134134134 For the apologetic motif in hellenistic Jewish writers, see Schiirer, A History History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ, II, III, 262-270; Bergmann, Jiidische Apologetik im neutestamentlichen Zeitalter\ and Kruger, Philo u. Josephus als Apologeten des Judentums.</page><page sequence="100">250 SAMUEL SANDMEL [100] represent piety. The opponents mention that child sacrifice is a usual practice among barbarians. Philo again concedes that this is so, but he declares that Moses was aware of the practice and considered it an abomination.135 Similarly, continue the opponents whom Philo quotes, the gymnosophists burn themselves on a funeral pile; and widows have been known to share the pyre of their deceased husbands.136 Philo's rebuttal consists in showing that Abraham's action is in no way like these. The child sacrificers have as a motive the desire to save their cities or country, and they give their children partly under compulsion and partly to gain glory and honor; as for such as the gymnosophists, since these are following an established custom, their deeds are diminished in signifi cance.137 Abraham, however, was not raised where it was custom ary for such sacrifices to take place. He is not coerced into his deed, since no one knows of it. There is no public calamity to avert. The solitude where the deed is done, especially with the servants left behind, eliminates any suspicion that glory was Abraham's motive.138 The truth is that Abraham has always been obedient to God. He has not previously neglected divine commands, nor received them with any sense of complaints. He lives where it is not customary for child sacrifice to take place (Philo here repeats himself). Added to this, Isaac is his only true-born son, born in Abraham's old age, and thereby the more precious. Abraham does not turn his son over to others to slaughter, as is the case among the child sacrificers, but he himself is going to to the deed. "Thus we see that he did not partly incline to the boy and partly to piety, but devoted his whole soul through and through to holiness, and disregarded the claims of their common blood." Now Philo asks the significant rhetorical question, "Which of all the points mentioned is shared by others?"139 135 Deut. 12.31. 136 136 Abr. 179-184. 13י Abr. 184-187. 138 Abr. 188-191. 139 Abr. 192-199.</page><page sequence="101">[101] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 251 There is, moreover, an allegorical explanation. Isaac repre sents joy, the eu7ra0e1a and χαρά of the understanding. The Sage is said to sacrifice his joy to God. Rejoicing, says Philo, is most closely associated with God alone, for men are subject to grief and fear. Only the divine nature is wholly free from grief or fear or passion, and it alone partakes of perfect happiness. God, however, returns joy to the mind which offers it as a sac rifice to Him.140 When joy comes to earth, Philo adds, it is never pure and free from mixture; grief is always joined to it. He illus trates this by allegorizing Sarah's fear and laughter of Gen. 18.12 and 15.141 It is God's way not to allow the human race to undergo unrelieved grief and pain; He mixes with these something of the better nature so that the soul can at times dwell in sunshine and calm. The soul of the wise spends the chief part of its life in glad-hearted contemplation.142 The incident, whether allegorically or literally interpreted, is an example of Abraham's piety. Other examples might be given in addition, Philo tells us, and these exist in great plenty, but it is is time now to turn from Abraham's relation with God to his relations with men. There is this connection: the observer of piety is also kindly; the person who observes holiness to God observes justice (δικαιοσύνη) to men. Of the many actions he could tell about, Philo will select only two or three.143 Abraham's justice is the first quality to be illustrated. Abra ham is exceedingly rich. Philo seems to be speaking of his own contemporaries, and possibly of his own situation: Abraham's wealth rivals that of the wealthy natives, and he is richer than is expected of an immigrant (μβτοικοϊ), but he incurs no censure from those who received him into their midst.144 He is praised by all who have experience with him.145 He smooths over and '4° Abr. 200-204. '4' Abr. 205-206. ,2וי Abr. 207. '43 Abr. 208. He next relates the incident of the separation from Lot, Gen. 13; the war with the kings, Gen. 14; the marriage with Hagar, Gen. 16; the death of Sarah, Gen. 23; and he discusses Abraham's faith, based on a number of selected verses. '44 An environmental touch. ■4s Abr. 209.</page><page sequence="102">252 SAMUEL SANDMEL [102] eliminates the quarrels between his servants and the neighbors. He does this not only with strangers who might be stronger than he, but even with those weaker, such as relatives, related by blood but not in morals.1"6 A nephew — Philo does not mention Lot by name — is such a relative. Lot sometimes fawns on Abraham, and sometimes is rebellious. He cannot control his servants, especially the shep herds stationed at a distance.1"7 The shepherds constantly quarrel with Abraham's herdsmen, who usually give way because of Abraham's gentleness. Ultimately Lot's shepherds go too far; Abraham's men begin to defend themselves, and a serious fight is under way.1"8 The news reaches Abraham that his men are triumphing. He does not wish, however, to see his nephew dis tressed through defeat. He reconciles the disputing shepherds, but he knows that some plan must be followed to avoid future altercations. He gives his nephew the choice of a better district to move to, agreeing to take what is left. In doing this Abraham knows he will get peace, the greatest of gains. But, asks Philo, who else would give way in a single point to someone weaker, and who else, able to conquer, would be willing to be defeated? Abraham, Philo tells us, takes for his ideal a life of freedom from strife and of tranquility.1"9 Philo turns the story into allegory. Abraham is the better type of soul which honors things primary and dominant in na ture, while Lot is the lower type which honors things subject and low.150 Philo alters his figure shortly; he ceases to discuss two types of soul and discusses instead the better and lower side 1146יי•" Abr. 210-211. 147 Lot means "inclining." He is the wavering person, midway between the sage and the wicked man, QG IV, 47. Not being wicked, he is sometimes treated favorably, and not being wise, sometimes unfavorably. In addition, as a "progressing soul" he is sometimes allegorically the mind of the sage before it attains sagacity. See below, notes 218, 265, and 298. Philo seems to make of Lot what he had already made of Abraham, a city dweller. 148 Abr. 212-213. 149 Abr. 214-216. See also QG III, 8, based on the LXX to Gen. 15.11, in which the MT ו.ישב אותם seems to have been read as ו;10ב אתם. for further on "tranquility." '5° Abr. 217-218.</page><page sequence="103">[103] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 253 within the same soul.151 Philo sees in the incident Abraham's rising above the lower (or material) part of the soul. Next, Philo illustrates Abraham's courage.152 Though Abra ham is peaceable and a lover of justice, he can become, to secure the peace, courageous and warlike. Philo uses as illustration Abraham's role in the war between the four kings of the east and the five kings of Sodom of Gen. 14. As Philo recounts the episode, the eastern part of the inhabited world is in the hand of four great kings, who hold in subjection the eastern nations on both sides of the Euphrates. (This geographical precision is an addition by Philo to the biblical account.) Other nations maintain a happy obedience to the four kings, but the Sodomites begin to undermine the peace by a long-planned-for revolt. Sodom, Philo tells us, is rich in corn, well-wooded and teeming with fruits; although it is small in size, it is, through its fertility, exceedingly prosperous. Therefore it has several rulers who love it and are fascinated by its charm.153 In conformity with his scorn of material things, Philo, through the above additions, motivates the rebellion by the Sodomites: Sodom has a superabundance of material things which leads to a love of them, and this love is the ultimate cause of the catastrophe to come. As Philo continues, the Sodomites are surfeited with good things, and therefore their satiety begets insolence.154 They grow ambitious beyond their powers. First they shake off the yoke; next they even attack their masters. Philo's disapproval of the Sodomites is clearly discernible; they are people who occupy themselves with material goods; they throw off a yoke which is tolerated, apparently with equanimity, by other nations. '5' Abr. 223-224. I discuss this below, page 280. י"י" Abr. 225 ff. '53 Abr. 225-228. 's■• ,4 Sr. 228. See QG IV, 23, on Gen. 18.20, the outcry of the Sodomites and Gomorrahites. Sodom means "blind" or "sterile"; Gomorrah means "measure." Folly is blind and barren, and "measures" by the human mind rather than God. So too Somn. II, 192; in Ebr. 222 ff. Philo, after denouncing wine-bibbing gluttony, and the basest pleasures, comments that no true glad ness grows in the soul of the wicked, since it has no healthy roots, but such as were burnt to ashes.</page><page sequence="104">254 SAMUEL SANDMEL [104] The four kings are mindful of their high birth. They arm themselves more powerfully, and then advance to the attack with great disdain. Their onslaught is easily successful. Some of the enemy they mow down in wholesale massacre, while others are taken prisoner; among these is the nephew of the Sage.155 As Philo recounts the incident, most of the pericope is Philonic and not biblical; Philo omits Gen. 14.5, with the account of the conquest of Nephilim, Zuzim and Emim. The allusion to higher birth is, I believe, more a reflection of Philo's scorn of the body loving Sodomites than of his actual admiration for the victorious kings. When the news reaches Abraham, the shock is severe. It is worse than if he had heard of his nephew's death, Philo tells us, for death is the end of everything in life, including its ills, while for the living the troubles which lie in wait are numberless.156 Again, Philo's hellenistic "rejection of this world" shows through. Abraham is eager to pursue the enemy to rescue his nephew. He is, however, a stranger and an immigrant — still another con temporaneous touch, added to the biblical account — so that he is at a loss to find allies, especially in view of the recent vie tories and great numbers of the enemy.157 But he finds allies, Philo tells us, in a new source — as does anyone set on deeds of justice and kindness. He collects his servants and divides them into two groups, the home-bred and those acquired by purchase. The latter Abraham tells to remain at home, for he fears they might revolt.158 He makes a roll-call,159 distributes them into centuries, and advances with three battalions. Philo is influenced here by some military knowledge. Scripture reports no more than that Abraham took 318 slaves; Philo turns this number into '« Abr. 229. 186 Abr. 230. 1" Abr. 231. 1s8 This addition by Philo seems based on an inference of this kind, that Gen. 14.14, mentions the home-born specifically; ergo, Abraham must not have taken along those acquired by purchase; ergo, there must have been a reason for it. Philo undoubtedly has had experience with servants, and had a greater measure of trust in the home-bred. 189 This notion, based on LXX Gen. 14.14, could not rest on MT; wa yareqyareq is a difficult word for the rabbis, and it leads them into endless fanciful explanations, all different from Philo's naturalistic explanation.</page><page sequence="105">[105] PHILOS PLACE IN JUDAISM 255 three battalions of a hundred men. Significantly, Philo adds that Abraham's reliance was not really in these, but in God,the com panion and defender of the just;160 and Philo has previously told us that Abraham's piety underlay his other virtues.161 Abraham makes the attack by night, after the enemy have supper and when they are preparing to go to bed.162 Some fall in their beds, while others, resisting, are annihilated. This vie tory, Philo assures us, is much more one of Abraham's courage of soul than of resources at hand.163 Abraham slaughters the enemy completely, including their kings, and he leaves them lying in front of the camp.164 Abraham brings his nephew back in triumph, bringing along with him the horses of the cavalry,165 other beasts, and spoil in plenty.166 The high priest of God — Philo does not mention Melchi zedek by name — considers the victory to have been won "not without God's directing care" (ίπιφροσύνη) and help in arms. The priest stretches forth his hands in prayer, and offers sacrifices of thanksgiving for the victory.167 As above,168 Philo ascribes by implication Abraham's success, as exemplified in his courage, to Abraham's piety.169 160 Abr. 232. A similar explanation is found in Gen. R. XLIII. There is no compelling reason to attribute the similarity to interdependence of the rabbis and Philo, for it is a natural inference that the patriarch, in embarking with a small force, trusted in God. 161 Abr. 192 fif. 161 Abr. 233. No wider divergence, in my opinion, between Philo and the rabbis, is to be found than in the interpretations of Gen. 14.15. Philo gives a naturalistic explanation in military terms; the rabbis tell us, in one passage (San.(San. 96a) that an angel named Night attacked the enemy; in other passages, that the night of Passover was divided, half for the present event and half for the Passover night, Tar.

He next turns the incident into allegory, as illustrative of the spiritual development of Abraham.1'0 Philo is now ready to demonstrate Abraham's cultivation of moderation. His proof rests on Abraham's conduct at the death of Sarah. Like a good dramatist, Philo enhances the worth of Abraham by a rather elaborate presentation of what Abraham lost in losing his wife. (Philo does not mention Sarah by name in this section.) The wife, Philo tells us, was gifted with every excellence. She shared Abraham's departure from homeland, the unceasing wan derings, the privations in famine, and the military campaigns.1'1 She partook of both the ill and the good which befell him and did not, like some other women, run away from mishaps.1'2 While Philo could tell many stories in praise of Sarah, he selects only one, the incident of Hagar.1'3 Sarah magnanimously sug* gests to Abraham that she would not be jealous of his taking another woman, not for lust but for procreation, in fulfillment of nature's inevitable law. Sarah herself will lend to him a bride to supply the lack. If offspring results, she will adopt the child as her very own.1'4 The woman is her own handmaiden — Philo does not mention Hagar by name — who is outwardly (σώμα) a slave, but inwardly (διάνοιαν) free and well-born, proved and tested by Sarah for many years. The slave is an Egyptian by birth, but a Hebrew by rule of life.1'3 That Hagar was an Egvp tian must have been a source of discomfort to Philo, who makes it abundantly clear in treating of the Pharaoh of Gen. 12 and the Pharaoh of Moses' day, that Egyptians are despicable lovers elsewhere provide him with allegorical material. He speaks of a handsome feast. Philo adds that the priest shares Abraham's joy, a spirit of sharing appropriate to the good men who aim to be well-pleasing to God, Abr. 235. 170 I discuss this in detail in the section on the allegorical Abraham, pages 268-272. 171 Philo is not paralleled by the rabbis in this bit of extravagance of Sarah's accompanying Abraham on his campaigns. There is no scriptural basis. 17נ Abr. 245-246. 173 Gen. 16.1-6. 174 Abr. 247-250. 175 Abr. 251.</page><page sequence="107">[107] PHILO' S PLACE IN JUDAISM 257 of bodily things. The clear note of contempt for Egyptians prob ably represents Philo's own attitude towards the Egyptians of Alexandria for whom he has a feeling of loathing.17'■ Sarah reminds Abraham that they are wealthy, indeed, they are wealthier beyond the usual scale of immigrants, even out shining those of the native inhabitants who are noted for pros perity.177 Again, the allusion seems to be comtemporaneous. It may be indicative of Philo's own wealth. Abraham's admiration for Sarah increases. He takes Hagar as a mate, until she has borne a child, or, indeed, until she becomes pregnant. Thereafter, he abstains from her through his natural continence and the honor he pays his lawful wife.178 A son is born to the hand-maiden; long afterwards179 Abraham and Sarah have a son of their own, a reward for their high excellence, a gift from God the bountiful.180 Philo abstains here from alluding to an intricately developed allegory of the incident of Hagar.181 Philo now reverts to Abraham. Sarah has died. Abraham now wrestles with sorrow like a grappler in the arena. He is determined to obey reason (λογίσμοϊ), the natural antagonist of passion; accordingly, he does not grieve as at an utterly new and unheard of misfortune, nor does he, on the other hand, assume an indiffer ence as though nothing painful has occurred. He chooses the mean rather than the extremes, and he arrives at moderation of feeling. He does not resent that nature should be paid the debt which is its due; he takes the blow quietly and gently.182 16ל Cf. In Flaccum, 17, 29. 1לל Abr. 252. 178 The rabbis aver that Hagar became pregnant after a single effort, Gen.Gen. R. XLV ; they do not say specifically that Abraham abstained from her thereafter, nor do they suggest natural continence as the motivation for such abstinence. In another rabbinic passage, Abraham reweds Hagar after Sarah's death and a daughter, Ba-kol, is born; see page 200. 1יל According to Genesis, Ishmael is thirteen when Isaac is born.

Colson, VI, pp. 598-599 and Cohn, I, 148, suggest that Philo may have known a work of Cranter on moderation in mourning. The view of the rabbis is the antithesis of moderation. Philo adds a "quickly" before the "rose" of Gen. 23.3; but they do not suggest that it is "quickly,"</page><page sequence="108">258 SAMUEL SANDMEL [108] Abraham weeps a little over the corpse, but he quickly rises up from it. He believes that further weeping is out of keeping with wisdom, which teaches him that death is not the extinction of the soul, but its separation and detachment from the body, and its return to the place whence it came, from God.183 And as no reasonable person chafes at repaying a debt, so he does not fret when nature takes back her own.184 It is to be noted that Philo is not simply giving his own judgment on death; he is ascribing this judgment to Abraham. Philo undoubtedly felt no sense of incongruity in the rather tortured ascription of his view on death to the sorrowing Abraham. Philo omits from the present account the "mourning and weeping" of Gen. 23.2; had he used them, he would have had to divest them of their usual import in order to substantiate a contention that Abraham bore the blow in moderation.185 The picture here is a completely hellenistic one, in all its aspects, especially in its standards of proper and improper mourning. As Philo continues the account, the chief people of the coun try come to sympathize and to their astonishment they see none of the customs of mourning they expect. Philo lists these for us: wailing, chanting of dirges, and beating of breasts.186 The thought suggests itself that the list represents Jewish practices of which Philo disapproves because these do not accord with moderation.187 Amazed as the people have been before at Abraham's great qualities, they are all the more amazed as they now note in but only after elaborate mourning. Cf. Ber. 18a; Gen. R. LVIII; and Mid. Hag, ad ad loc. 183 Cf. Opif. 135. The subject is treated in greater detail in QG IV 71-83, see below, notes 379-381. 18&lt; Abr. 258-259. 183 In QG IV, 73, Philo ascribes the mourning and weeping to the loss by the Sage of virtue, the allegorical Sarah. Inferentially, there, too, he denies that Abraham mourns to excess. 186 Abr. 260. 187 It is impossible to go beyond conjecture that Philo is here dissociating himself from rites of mourning as practiced by his fellow Jews. In context it is the natives of the region to whom he ascribes the rites and not to Jews. Yet the list of rites rejected are mentioned in Scripture, and come into "normative1' Jewish practice. But even if the allusion is not to contemporaneous practice of other Jews, nevertheless Philo's formula is unmistakably hellenistic.</page><page sequence="109">[109] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 259 admiration his quiet, sober air. They cannot contain their ad miration in silence, but declare to Abraham, "Thou art a king from God among us."188 Philo asserts that the words are true but he proceeds to show in what sense they are true. Other king ships, he says are man-made, and stem from wars, campaigns and numberless ills, inflicted as a result of strife. The kingship of the Sage, however, is a gift from God; such a king brings no harm to anyone but rather the acquisition and enjoyment of good things to all his subjects.189 Philo has now completed his demonstration of Abraham's self-control and his moderation, and he has made of Abraham the stoic ideal of the philosopher-king.1'0 In conformity with his emphasis on Abraham's piety, he has carefully included the statement that Abraham's kingship is a divine gift. Philo next turns to the faith of Abraham who "trusted in God."1'1 Such faith, Philo tells us, is a little thing if measured in words, but a very great thing if made good by actions.1'2 Philo dismisses as unworthy of trust such human accomplish ments as high office, fame, honors, wealth, noble birth, or bodily health or capacity of body.1'3 He adds a paragraph of scorn for those who trust in bodily beauty: images and statues surpass the human frame in beauty, and Greeks and barbarians set up 188 The verse is LXX Gen. 23.6, and cannot rest readily on MT, which reads נשיא; Onk. and Jon. read רב. The rabbis, too, make a king of Abraham; they derive this, however, from Gen. 14.17; see Tan. Be-ha'aloteka XVII. Gen.Gen. R. XLIII portrays the survivors of the battle of the nine kings addressing Abraham as Nasi, Melek, and Elohim\ but Abraham replies that the world lacks neither a king nor God; so, too, SER 116. This latter pericope seems to me to reflect the knowledge on the part of the rabbis of the pretensions to divinity by hellenistic kings, and it is a denial of the authenticity of such pretensions. Abraham is conceived of as a king in the traditional Jewish interpretation of Ps. 110, cf. Rashi and Ibn Ezra to verse 1. The "king" in rabbinic literature, however, is a political figure and not the "philosopher" of Philo. 189 Abr. 261. See also QG IV, 76. "° So, too, Colson, VI, p. 599.

On the other hand, faith in God is the one safe and infallible good. It is the consolation of life, the fulfillment of bright hopes, the death of ills, the harvest of goods, the acquaintance with piety,piety,piety; and the heritage of happiness. It is the all-around better ment of the soul firmly fastened on God.195 Lack of faith is like traveling on a slippery road, the path of the bodily and the ex ternal, and the soul on such a journey is certain to fall. Those, however, who press on to God along the doctrines of virtue walk without falling. Belief in the former is disbelief in God, while disbelief in them is belief in God.196 Philo, then, has al located faith as something pertaining to the intelligible world, and he denies that confidence in the perceptible things can be faith. This opposition between the perceptible and the intelligible, as applied to faith, serves to emphasize even more sharply that Philo's thinking inevitably seems to adjust itself to hellenistic modes of expression. Since, in Philo's thought, God is allocated to the intelligible world, true faith operates only in the realm of the intelligible. Abraham possesses this queen of virtues, faith in God. More over, though others (in the Scriptural account) surpass him in years, Abraham is the first to be called an elder.197 The true "elder" is shown not by his length of days but by a laudable and perfect life. A long life spent among bodily things makes one a long-lived child; he who is enamored of sound sense, wisdom, and faith, is justly called elder, and "elder" is equivalent to "first." "4 Abr. 267. 1»5 Abr. 268. '»c Abr. 269. 197 So LXX Gen. 24.1. MX reads זקן. Cohn, Philos Werke, I, 151, makes the comment that πρεσβύτερος means old, whereas זקן has the sense of "ehr wuerdig." Both זקן and πρεσβύτερος seem to me to have this sense. In the present context, however, Philo interprets the word as "honorable"; the rabbis deduce from the passage that until Abraham's time the visible signs of old age did not exist, for Abraham is the first to be termed "old," San. 107b. See note 296 below, and page 215 above.</page><page sequence="111">[Ill] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 261 The Sage is the first of the human race, like the pilot of a ship, or the ruler in a city, or a general in war, or as a soul in a body, and a mind in soul, or heaven in the world, or God in heaven.198 What Philo has been doing has been to contrast Abraham with with ordinary men, to show Abraham's pre-eminence. As the first among men, he surpasses them in endowments and in achievements; and his capacities bring benefits to men.199 These capacities are the result of his possession of faith. Faith makes Abraham the "first" among the human race. Now Philo proceeds towards his climax: God holds Abraham's faith in high esteem, and he repays this faith with divine faith; this consists in God's confirming by an oath the gifts already promised.200 God's oath is a measure of faith added to that faith which Abraham ante cedently possessed. Moreover, that God utilized an oath is a further token of Abraham's eminence, in that God thereby addresses Abraham not as God usually addresses man, but as a friend addresses an acquaintance.201 Abraham, then, is not only pre-eminent among men, but his eminence is such that God converses with him in familiar terms. Philo has now completed his section on Abraham's faith, the last of the four sections. He now comes to the climax of his 8יי Abr. 270-272. See also QG III, 44, based on Gen. 17.6; Philo states that the sage is moreover an intercessor (Marcus supposes that μβσίτηί or παρά κΧητοςκΧητος lay in the Greek) with God, seeking forgiveness for his countrymen, who have committed sins. Philo somewhat similarly treats the circumcision of "those of foreign birth," Gen. 17.27, in QG III, 62. In V. C. 31 the true "elder" among the Therapeutae gives a discourse on the Sabbath. 1,9 Gocdenough, 144, points out that this list of primacies implies the notion of the rule-soter. See also QG IV, 53, to Gen. 19.27-28. The rabbis and Philo unite in adding that Abraham prayed, Philo being alone in commenting that it was to avert the destruction already begun. QG IV, 54, based on God "remembered Abraham" in Gen. 19.29, accords with the wide and usual opinion that Lot's rescue was for Abraham's sake. See also QG IV, 70, based on Gen. 20.17-18. 300 Abr. 273. On Abraham's faith see QG IV, 17, and below, page 291 f. 201 4br. 273. As noted above, page 165 Philo alludes to Abraham as the "friend of God." I show in the section on Allegory that "friend of God" is equivalent to prophet; see below, note 347.</page><page sequence="112">262 SAMUEL SANDMEL [112] treatise: to all the other praises of the Sage, this crowning praise, that "This man did the divine law and the divine commands."202 The law was not the written law, but that which unwritten na ture prompted him to do. When men have God's promises before them, Philo tells us, they should trust in them most firmly. Such a man was Abraham, the founder of the nation. Some, Philo tells us, interpret Abraham as one who obeyed the law; Abraham, however, was more than that; he was himself a law and an un written statute. In summary, the literal Abraham is a man who makes a false start in astrology, but through learning abandons that un true philosophy in favor of true wisdom. He ultimately achieves perfection, so that he is outstanding in his piety towards God and in the practice of virtue towards his fellowmen. He is a true Sage, a philosopher-king and a soter. He lives by the law of nature, and he is, in fact, a law incarnate and made vocal. A mystic, he retires from the city from time to time. In the solitude of the wilderness he is able to rise to the best possible sight of God. The literal Abraham is depicted as perfected. In the allegorical Abraham we shall see how this perfection was achieved. Ill The allegorical Abraham is the record of the process through which Abraham becomes the man of perfect piety and virtue. The spiritual development begins when Abraham, who has been mistakenly absorbed in pantheistic materialism, by divine inter vention becomes the first man in history to recognize that pan theism is a wrong conclusion, based on a wrong method. Abra ham, therefore, turns away from pantheism, in favor of a new quest which begins within himself. He learns what the body is 102 Gen. 26.5. See below, note 289. Philo interprets the commands as the law of nature; the rabbis use this verse to prove that Abraham observed the whole Torah, Kid. 82a, or both the Torah and the words of the Scribes, 10s. Kid. V, or even the laws of Erub, Yoraa 28b.</page><page sequence="113">[113] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 263 and what the senses are, and he discerns the peril in them to the rational soul. He therefore conquers his senses and his passions and is able to free himself from domination by bodily matters. He seeks solitude and the opportunity for contemplation. He possesses excellent powers of reason, both of the inner mind and of the outer manifestation of mind, the spoken word. He masters the encyclia, and goes beyond them into knowledge of true philos ophy. His virtue is such that his mind has complete ascendency over all the members of the body, and therefore he is able to raise his mind above mundane matters. His mind grasps matters rele vant to the intelligible world, possessing as it does a keen sense of discrimination. His gifts are such that he is able to rise to the highest goal of the religious life, the sight of God. As one in control of his body, Abraham is a philosopher-king; as a mystic who achieves the vision of God, Abraham is a prophet through whom divine words and promises are spoken. Abraham's soul is so richly endowed that in contrast to souls which simply dis appear at the death of the body, Abraham's soul returns to the divine essence from which it has come. This is no more than a brief summary of matters now to be presented in detail. Certain other preliminaries ought, however, to be mentioned. First, the allegorical use of Abraham as the figure for the man who progressed is not original with Philo. He heard it, he tells us, from certain "natural philosophers."203 Second, the context into which Philo fits Abraham is a completely Greek framework. Aristotle had asked the question how happi ness and virtue could be acquired, and he had considered, in one passage,204 three possibilities: by learning, μαθβτόν, or by habit, βθιστόν, or practice, άσκητδν, or by some divine dispensa tion θβία μοίρα. In another passage205 Aristotle mentions as the possibilities teaching, διδαχή, habit, Wos, or nature, φύσις.206 Philo gives us these same categories,20' and in a number of dif 2נ" Abr. 99• 20יי Eth. Nie. I, 9, 1099b, lines 9-10; Paris, 1883 edition, p. 9. 20s Ibid.., X, 9, 1179b, 20-23. 206 According to Wolfson, Philo, II, 197, Aristotle accepted only the first two as possibilities, and rejected the notion of virtue by nature. 2"' Direct dependency on Aristotle is not necessarily indicated; the subject</page><page sequence="114">264 SAMUEL SANDMEL [114] ferent passages he discusses these same possibilities.208 Philo builds his discussion around the patriarchs as allegorical figures for each of the categories; the patriarchs are, allegorically, types of the soul, τρόποι ψυχής, all of them worthy, άστβΐοι; Abraham pursues the good, του κάλου, through teaching, Isaac through nature, and Jacob through practice. The (literal) patriarchs each possessed all three capacities, but the allegorical quantity which Philo associates with each is that one which most predomi natingly characterizes the individual. Each of the patriarchs possesses all these patriarchal qualities or capacities; those capac ities can be equated, Philo tells us, with the Graces. That is to say, the capacities, as part of the endowment of the individual, are innate; as "graces," they are the gift of God, or else, Philo tells us, the gift to the reasonable soul from the capacity itself.209itself.209 Neither the conception nor the allegorical figure representing the conception is, then, original with Philo. He has absorbed them so completely, however, that almost his every approach to a scriptural mention of Abraham leads him to equate the scriptural verse with some aspect of perfection through teaching, or with the particular incident as a proof that Abraham either assimilates assimilates the matter mentioned as a spiritual benefit and ad vancement, or else spurns it, if by chance the scriptural verse deals with what to Philo is something unseemly. I divide my discussion into five sections. I derive this division from Philo himself who speaks of five stages in the development of the progressing soul210 (based on an allegory of the heifer, the goat, the ram, the turtle-dove, and the pigeon of Gen. 15.9) body, sense-perception, reason, natural philosophy, and the intelligible world. The record of the allegorical Abraham is the manner in which he progresses through such stages to perfection of soul. may well have been a usual one in the various philosophical schools before and after Philo's life-time.

The Stage of Body Abraham is perfected through being taught, in the sense that he makes a false start and has to begin anew. Abraham was born in Chaldean materialistic pantheism, and for a long time was him self an adherent of that creed. The Chaldeans were especially active in the study of astrology (αστρονομία) and ascribed every thing to the movements of the stars. Thus they glorified visible existence, and they left out of consideration the invisible and the intelligible. They concluded, moreover, that the world itself was God, thereby profaning the Creator by likening him to the created. Abraham, however, did not remain in pantheism; he opened his "soul's eye as though after a profound sleep, and beginning to see the pure beam instead of the deep darkness, he followed the ray and discerned .... what he had not beheld before, a charioteer and pilot presiding over the world." Abra ham is urged by the Hieros Logos to desist from observing the cosmos, the greatest of cities, and for a time to observe the lesser city, man himself.211 Abraham is one of the goodly natures which God promotes without any manifest reason.212 God has created him in such a way that Abraham merits esteem213 since his mind, in turning Abr."י Abr. 68-71; cf. Mi g. 184 ff. Another expression of the view that in departing from Chaldea Abraham departed from astrology is found in QG III, i and Heres, 96 ff., based on Gen. 15.7. The Ur Kasdirn of MT is rendered by LXX (and in Philo's text) by (k XaXSaia!v, thereby omitting the Ur, as though reading 'eres in its place. The peg on which the very frequent rabbinic allusion to Abraham's rescue from Nimrod's fiery furnace is hung is the pun on Ur, either at this verse or at Gen. 11.28. For the legend see Ginzberg, I,I, 198 ff., and V, 212-214. I have discerned in Philo not one single trace of this legend, and no overtone in his dealing with Nimrod of it. As indicated on page 151, Philo lacks allusions to patriarchal anecdotes; not impossibly he found them somewhat juvenile in comparison with his own theosophical pro fundities. Indeed, one is struck by a kind of mathematical proportion which can express superficially a possible key to a New Testament problem. The Gospel according to John lacks the anecdotes and pithy sayings of Jesus. The form and manner of the Synoptic Gospels are to John as rabbinic form and manner are to Philo. 212 LA III, 79-84. 21נ Philo in this passage regards "Abram" favorably; elsewhere the name is</page><page sequence="116">266 SAMUEL SANDMEL [116] away from pleasure and mortal things, soaring aloft, contemplates the universe and its parts, and, going still higher, explores God and His nature, urged to this by the love of knowledge δι' 'έρωτα επιστήμης*1*επιστήμης*1* The gifted man, like Abraham, despite a false start, is able by divine help to withdraw from a preoccupation with the visible universe to raise his level of perception to the loftiest of goals, to God. But this process is a long and arduous one. First he must resort to a study of himself. It is, Philo assures us, a wrong method for the mind to plunge into astrology before it learns the senses of the body.215 Abraham therefore migrates to Haran;216 this means that Abraham studies his senses. Terah, Abraham's father, had taken Abraham to Haran (Gen. 11·3Ι-32) where Terah had died. Terah too had known that it was not appropriate for one to try to learn the heavens until he had learned himself. Terah is the figure for the mind which dis covers the need of self-knowledge.217 Terah, however, made the synonymous with our character when still a Chaldean: Gig. 62, Cher. 4, and Mut.Mut. 66. 2"4 LA III, 84. 215 Somn. I, 53. 216 Abr. 72. Philo derives the word "senses" from his etymology of Haran, "holes." The senses are in those organs of the body for which places are dug out in the body. In connection with the injunction of the High Priest to lay aside his usual robes before entering the Holy of Holies (Lev 16), that is, according to Philo, the robe of opinions and impressions through bodily senses, Philo cites, among others who become similarly naked, Abraham; his proof text is Gen. 12.1. See LA II, 55-59. 217 Somn. I, 48. Philo gives the etymology of Terah as (tar-reah) "spyer of odor." Terah spies out the odor of virtue while Abraham goes on to taste it. Terah anticipated Socrates, according to Philo, Somn. I, 58, in advocating "know thyself." In context this is in the longest passage in which Philo dis cusses Abraham's migration from Ur to Haran, Somn. I, 41 ff. Philo emphasizes that the purpose of the scriptural account is not "that we may learn as from a writer of history that certain people became immigrants, leaving the land of their ancestors . . . ." It is astronomy (astrology) which is abandoned: "Why are you so busy with what you ought to leave alone, the things above?" In the passage Philo cites Gen. 11.32, Terah's death in Haran, as proof that Terah did not possess virtue, but only scouted it out.</page><page sequence="117">[117] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 267 mistake of remaining in the world of the senses, while Abraham goes on beyond it.218 Abraham learns what the senses are; he makes, in fact, an examination of every component part of the body. He learns about senses and about passions, about pleasures and fears, and he learns how to counteract these.219 Abraham, accord ingly, does not dally with the sense of odor, Keturah, for it is a sensual pleasure; he turns away from her in order to cleave to virtue.220 218 Somn. I, 48. In QG IV, 26, interpreting Gen. 18.23, Philo also discusses a contrast, the man who is a mixture of righteousness and unrighteousness, derived from Scripture that there may be some righteous men in Sodom, allegorically some righteousness in a foolish man. Such a man is in contrast to Abraham who went beyond the senses. The surrounding of the house, Gen. 19.4, symbolizes allegorically the traits of the unproductive soul in surrounding the body with attractions, QG IV, 36; cf. Somn. I, 122-123 for a description of "Italian" luxury, associated with Sodom. The contents of Gen. 19.5, "bring them out that we may know them," is the effort of the im pure to divert the noble from soul to body, QG IV, 37. Lot (Gen. 19.7-8) is willing to offer his daughters, his thoughts which serve his bodily needs and are feminine, so as to save those which are masculine, zealous of wisdom and virtue, QG IV, 38. Gen. 19.9 is the rebuke to the sojourner who in the territory of the licentious pronounces judgment on evil, QG IV, 39. In sum, neither the evil Sodomites nor the wavering Lot paralleled Abraham's achievement of going beyond the senses. While the contrast is not exactly the same as that of Terah and Abraham, it is of the same genre. Mig.Mig. 176 quotes Gen. 12.4, that Abraham was seventy-five when he left Haran. The immediate passage does not treat the "seventy-five," but rather the significance of moving out of the senses, Haran. Philo reverts to the seventy-five in Mig. 198 ff. ; it is the "borderland between perceptible and intelligible being, between older and younger, between corruptible and incorruptible." 21י Mig. 187-195. See also in QG III, 41 the first of Philo's three explana tions of Gen. 17.3. 220 Sac. 43-45; cf. QG IV, 147 on Gen. 25.1. Philo seems initially embar rassed at encountering Keturah in the Bible, but his allegorical ingenuity enables him to allocate her appropriately. In Sac. 43-45, he associates her and Hagar as two transient stages through which Abraham passed. Elsewhere, Confus.Confus. 74 and Mig. 94, her low status is demonstrated by the contrast in the gifts which Abraham gives to her offspring and to Isaac; the latter receives the laws of nature, while Keturah's children receive the enacted laws.</page><page sequence="118">268 SAMUEL SANDMEL [118] Abraham makes great progress in learning his senses and his passions and in conquering them.221 Thereby Abraham establishes 221 Circumcision symbolizes this, Mig. 92; see also QG III, 46-50 and 52 based on Gen. 17.10-12 and 14, and QG III, 61, based on Gen. 17.24-25. Philo also represents the incidents of Gen. 14 as Abraham's conquest of the senses and the passions. Four of the sovereign kings are the passions: pleasure, grief, desire, and fear; the five kings are the senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. The passions exact tribute from the senses. When the tribute is rendered, the alliance between the passions and the senses holds good; when it is withheld, discord arises in the body, as when old age or pains beset. Two of the organs, touch and taste, are within the body and are low senses; the other three, the organs of smell, hearing, and sight, are for the most part outside the body and therefore are able to escape complete enslavement by the body; Abr. 236-241. The ten nations of Gen. 15.19-21 are the actions the opposite of wisdom, ultimately destroyed by God. See Cong. 119 and QG III, 17. The latter, in Philo Philo Supplement I, 201, note d, is incorrectly stated to be Philo's only com ment on the scriptural section. Parenthetically, Philo's proof of the holiness of the number ten is but tressed in Cong. 91-92, by adding Abraham to the five and four kings, giving us a ten and by citing the "tenth part" of Gen. 14.20. Philo's thought, at least some of the time, seems to be that in Abraham's progress there was a stage in which the issue of senses and passions versus the soul needed to be fought out. "Lot" is "Abraham" at that as yet indecision stage. As a symbol for indecisive wavering, Lot partakes somewhat of virtue in that he only inclines in the opposite direction, but does not actually get there. Gen. 19.23 f. serves Philo as a basis of indicating a partial affinity in Lot to virtue; the passage that the sun, the divine Logos, went forth upon the earth, and Lot entered into So'ar (Gen. 19.23-24) demonstrates that the divine logos gives a refuge and safety to those akin to virtue. See Somn. I, 85-89; QG QG III, 51 and the fragments in Harris and Lewy, reprinted as appendix A in Philo Supplement II. The Sodomites, contrasted with Lot, are one of Philo's several examples of seeking and not finding, based on Gen. 19.11, a just frustration for those seeking unseemly things, QG IV, 41. Similarly Philo renders Gen. 19.4, in Con}. 27-28. The Sodomites are those who try to bring shame upon divine thoughts; so again somewhat similarly QG IV, 36. Lot, to repeat, is sometimes a different entity, contrastable with Abraham, yet sometimes the Abraham type of progressing mind at the stage at which wavering still abides, ultimately to be passed by, Mig. 13. As the antithesis to Abraham, see Mig. 148 ff., based on Gen. 12.4. Lot at the gate of the Sodomites (Gen. 19.1) symbolizes the progressing man who is neither within nor outside virtue, QG IV, 31. The wavering man (conjecturing about the lacuna in QG IV, 32; cf. Marcus I, 307) receives "appearance" before "truth." The divine powers, which had entered the</page><page sequence="119">[119] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 269 democracy within himself.222 The means of this establishment is the use of chastening reason {σωφρονιστής \6yos).223 In contrast with Abraham who conquers his senses and passions, there is the mind which succumbs to them, loving them. Such a one was the wicked king of Egypt (Gen. 12. io 20) who pretended, like an actor, to want fellowship with virtue (Sarah, allegorically), so as to have, undeservedly, a good reputation.224 Abraham knows true peace.225 Beyond the mere conquest of his bodily senses and passions, he so controls them that they are perfect Abraham's home, declined to enter the imperfect Lot's, preferring to remain in the street, QG IV, 33, on Gen. 19.2. The MT to Gen. 19.3 reads ויפצר בם, "he pressed them"; LXX reads τταραβίάξίτο, he "forced" them; the powers turned aside from Lot because of the use of force; the sage desires wisdom willingly, whereas the opposite of the sage needs to be forced! 222 Colson and Whitaker, VI, p. 118, define "democracy" in Philo as each part of the state having its proper amount of power. Philo speaks several times of democracy as the best constitution, Gonf. 108, Abr. 242, Spec. Leg. IV 237, and Virt. 180. Philo elsewhere defines democracy as the mean between mob rule and tyranny; it presupposes the presence of a ruler who is neither too cruel nor too yielding. Applied to the individual, democracy is the situation in which the mind rules the body like a goatherd or shepherd; such a ruling mind "chooses for himself and the creatures he tends what is advantageous, in preference to what is agreeable," Agr. 45-48. Respecting democracy in the soul, Melchizedek, Gen. 14.18, is the exemplar of the true king, contrasted with the despot; the despot is war-like, but Melchizedek is the prince of peace. Melchizedek is therefore reason which persuades, rather than a despot who orders. The Ammonites and Moabites (Deut. 23.4 ff.) failed to provide bread and water; these, allegorically derived respectively from sense perception and from only their father's mind, take no thought of God. In contrast to them, reason, Melchizedek, did provide bread and wine. The wine of reason can give to strong souls the sober intoxication, which is another way of describing "prophecy." See LA III, 79-82. Melchizedek, like Lot, is the experience of Abraham, but at the stage of "reason," rather than at "wavering." 223 Abr. 242-244. This allegory assumes that nine kings opposed Abraham whereas in the biblical account five kings rebelled against four and Abraham was a by-stander. 22&lt;Abr. 99 f. 225 True peace is defined in the passage as the state which exists when there is welfare outside, welfare in the body, and welfare in the soul; Heres 287.</page><page sequence="120">270 SAMUEL SANDMEL [120] able only infrequently to arise to challenge the soul.226 The pas sions bring afflictions on man in the period of his enslavement to the body.227 The enslavement consists in the subjection of the intellect to the sway of the passions. Abraham, however, restrains these as a chairman restrains people at a turbulent meeting.228 When the enslavement occurs it involves (following Gen. 15.16) "four hundred years."22' The enslavement is not permanent in the case of someone like Abraham, for in the fourth generation (Gen. 15.16) there is a return.230 The passions, since they are bodily matters, are obstacles to understanding.231 226 Philo interprets the famine of Gen. 12.10 as a dearth of passions, HeresHeres 287-289. 227 Phiio is allegorizing the bird(s) of Gen. 15.11, which descend on the segments in the Covenant between the pieces. LXX reads opvea which Philo takes to mean the passions which descend upon the body. MT reads העיט, a singular, rather than the plural of LXX. The exegesis is possible only on LXX. See Heres 268-270. ™*Heres™*Heres 243; QG III, 8. Philo is still interpreting Gen. 15.11 The birds have descended and, according to LXX, συνίκάθίσεν αΰτοΐς, as though rendering ו;10ב אתם "sat down with them1'; MT, however, reads utilizing the same letters, ו;שב אתם "drove them off." The LXX reading has forced Philo into the use of the highly artificial picture of the chairman at the meeting; MT would have provided Philo with a readier figure of the overcoming of the passions. It is hard for me to believe, in the light of a passage such as this, that Philo had any direct and personal knowledge of the Hebrew text, or, indeed, any useful knowledge of Hebrew. 229 Heres, 269-270. 230 The four generations are interpreted as the four periods in the life-time of the individual. The first period lasts for seven years, and the second period is the period of youth. The third period is that at which the individual is tended for his illnesses by philosophy, and the fourth period is that in which the soul, through the aid of philosophy, is firmly rooted in the virtues. In the first period, the soul is like smooth wax on which there is an impression of neither good nor evil; in the second period the body is in its bloom and the passions are fanned into flames, Heres 293-298; cf. QG III, 12. 231 Heres 268. A strange bit of exegesis is found in Ebr. 23-24. As the first in a series of examples of the harm that evils can do to the good soul, Philo passingly cites the "cutting" which Chedorlaomer and his fellow kings had done to Abraham! MT Gen. 14.17 not only reads הכותו "smiting," but there it is clear that it is Abraham who has done the smiting. LXX reads από της κοπής κοπής του Χοδαλλαγόμορ κ.τ.Χ., that is LXX seems to omit, as unneces sary, the pronominal suffix of the Hebrew. Philo takes the genitive in the LXX as subjective of κοπής, where the MT puts these words in the accusative case</page><page sequence="121">[121] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 271 The threat of subjection to the body is universal. Every man, Philo tells us, is in some way a slave: outside the body there are cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and many calamities, while inside the body there are pleasures and desires. Therefore when the soul of the wise man, like the soul of Abraham, descends from above, from the sky, and enters a mortal body, it encounters both out side and inside influences. Accordingly, all the while the soul of such a man as Abraham is in the body, it is, because of these considerations, in a land not its own.232 The earthly nature of the body is quite alien to pure intellect, and tries to enslave it. Freedom from such enslavement can come only after affliction, (using את) as objects of the infinitive. The German translation of Adler, in V, 15, is greatly superior to the fuzzy rendering at this place by Colson and Whitaker, III, 329-331; these latter miss the point of Ebr. 23: the vices destroy the most important inner attribute, the thinking soul. Adler properly cites respecting this latter Somn. I 128, Fuga 148, and Opif. 146. Piecing together from the incohesive items presented in QG IV, 71-83 on Gen. 23.1-19, the death and burial of Sarah, one infers that Philo had not achieved some unified thesis as he has done with Gen. 15, in Heres and 16 in Congress, both of which chapters are also represented in QG. The section is germane to the question of the relation of mind to body. Abraham's mourning for Sarah is the grief of the sage on separation from wisdom. The "possession of a grave" means authority over the body which is the "grave of the soul." The choicest of the monuments (LXX reads μνημάοι "memorials" for MT q'barim)q'barim) offered him, is the utmost "recollection" of concern for bodily luxu ries. The request to speak to Ephron is Abraham's wish for the people to speak in the council of the soul (cf. VC 27) on his own behalf and to discover the worth of reason (the silver). Ephron means "dust" and Hittite "madness of fear"; cf. Somn. II, 89. The foolish and the mad give the body the chief rank. The double cave, (Machpelah being rendered by LXX as τό σπήλαιον το διπλούν)διπλούν)διπλούν) consists of inner and outer ones; they are like the two facets of the body, which responds to external things in lust, and but to inner reason by being controlled. The field, which Abraham had not requested, was offered by the foolish man as equipment for the body for its pleasure. The cave is pre sumably in the field in verse 9 and 11, but in 17 the field seems to be in the cave; when the body is not ruled by the mind it comes under the power of external things; when it is ruled by mind, it not only does not succumb to external rule, but indeed contains and rules over them. Hebron (verse 19) means "joining," and alludes to the possibility of joining body to soul in such a way that the body ministers obediently to soul, the reigning power. Philo uses Gen. 15.13, that Abraham's descendants would be in a land not their own, as his Scriptural basis.</page><page sequence="122">272 SAMUEL SANDMEL [122] the discomfort which the individual undergoes in conquering, as Abraham did, the vices inherent in the body.2» Abraham then, has controlled his passions, and has thor oughly conquered them. This conquest involves not only a sub jection, but also the capacity for using certain bodily properties. Abraham, we shall see, uses sense-perception as a good servant. One example which Philo gives is his discussion of the contrast in the relationship between Abraham and sense perception, and in the relationship of others to it. Eliezer, for example, represents the mind which treats the senses as a master, while Abraham treats the senses as a bondservant. Philo illustrates the contrast by his exegesis of Gen. 15.2 ff. Masek234 means "kiss"235 of greet ing, in contrast with true love. Masek, the "blood-soul," or lower mind, represents the life in the senses. Her son, Damascus Eliezer, the body and the bodily soul, is the figure for the man who lives on the level of animals.236 Now every man, Philo tells us, possesses Masek, the senses. The multitude regard her as a mistress and give her genuine and deep affection, but Abraham regards her as a servant and gives her no more than the "kiss" of greeting.237 233 Heres 268-270; QG III, 10. See Conf. 26, based on Gen. 14.3 and QG IV, 53, based on Gen. 19.27-28. «4 Philo follows LXX Gen. 15.2, which diverges from MT in that it regards Masek as a proper name. "5 The etymology, like the etymology of other names in Philo, is based on the supposed Hebrew. Here nshq is identifiable as the root. While it is not strange that etymologies are used for the names occurring in both LXX and MT, it is worthy of note that Masek occurs as a name only in LXX, but is never theless accompanied by an etymology. For the question of Philo's knowledge of Hebrew, there is the peculiarity to be noted that he knows a Hebrew etymol ogy but gives no evidence of knowing that in the MT the word was not necessarily a name. 236 Damascus is made up of the Hebrew dam, blood, the "soul as a whole," that is, the soul without the divine, immaterial part; and saq, sackcloth, the body. Eliezer, "God is my helper," is the divine gift of breath which animates the mass of clay, Heres 40-41 ; 58. 237 Masek, representing the blood-soul (the lower mind), is feminine because that lower mind, by which also irrational animals live, has relation ship with the female, material line; Sarah, virtue, is of the male line (Gen. 20.12) and is indeed begotten of God. See Heres 61-62. Philo's fuller inter pretation of the blood-soul is found in Heres 54 ff. ; see also Spec. I, 171 and</page><page sequence="123">[123] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 273 b. Sense Perception Abraham uses his senses as a master uses a servant. By their use he is able to make inferences which lead him to a lower knowledge, and then ultimately to a higher knowledge. This lower knowledge, based on the senses, is the stage of sense perception. Abraham's mastery of sense perception is such that he is able to distinguish between presentations where the object is real and apprehended, and presentations where this is not the 238 case. Sense perception for Philo is the gate through which the mind goes into the intelligible world.239 Abraham utilizes sense Deter.Deter. 83 ff. Drummond I, 320-321, discusses the "lower mind" and its affinity with Stoic philosophy; see also Wolfson, I, 386 ff., for Philo's debt here both to Plato and Aristotle. In contrast with Masek, the "blood-soul," or lower mind, which has descent from the female line (Maseq being the "mother" of "Damascus"), virtue stems from the male line, which Philo avers is proved from Gen. 20.12. See Heres 61-62, QG IV, 68, and compare Ebr. 61. One of many contrasts between male and female rests on the names Ammon and Moab of Gen. 19.37-38, treated without much variation from Philo's usual exegesis in QG IV, 58. «8 Heres 132. Colson and Whitaker, IV, p. 569, cite from Diog. Laert. VII, 46, a passage illustrating the difference between the two. The appre hended is defined as "that which proceeds from a real object, agrees with that objecti tself, and has been imprinted seal-fashion and stamped upon the mind" ; the other is "that which does not proceed from any real object, or, if it does, fails to agree with reality itself, not being clear and distinct." Cf. also Drum mond, I, 354-356 and Wolfson, II, 6-7. Philo's basis is part of his allegory of Gen. 15.9, found also in QG III, 3. ". . . As those who desire to see our cities go in through gates, so all who wish to apprehend the unseen world are introduced to it by receiving the impression of the visible world," Somn. I, 188. Philo says, in the same passage, that the irrational soul gathers sensations which the rational soul uses to form conceptions. Elsewhere (LA I, 29-30) he gives the same teaching in another form which he derives from Gen. 2.6, the spring which watered the face of the earth. The mind (the spring) waters the senses (the face of the earth), sending to each sense the stream suitable to it. In a chain of three things, mind, sense-perception, and perceived objects, sense-perception is in the middle. Unless there is some object for sense-perception to perceive, the mind does not function in the senses. The mind and the object are always practicing a reciprocity of giving: the object lies ready as the material for sense perception</page><page sequence="124">274 SAMUEL SANDMEL [124] perception as a means of acquiring knowledge.240 This lower knowledge is quite respectable; in its domain lies the curriculum of the lower schools, symbolized by Hagar.241 As a prelude to his union with Virtue, Abraham masters the encyclia.242 Abraham accomplishes this when his progressing mind is on the borderline between sense perception and the intelligible world.243 At this point Abraham is already married244 to Sarah, virtue, and al though virtue is the most prolific of qualities, Sarah is barren to and the mind moves sense perception to produce an impulse towards the object. The capacity of sense-perception marks the superiority of the living creature over the non-living. 24° Cong. 155. The knowledge based on perception is the lower knowledge; the higher is the intelligible knowledge. 241 Hagar means etymologically "sojourning"; as an Egyptian Hagar was therefore "body." For the good mind the encyclia are a transient phase at the highest aspect of body; they catalogue, arrange, and classify the informa tion which the bodily senses supply, Cong. 20-23. 242 Philo shows the preparatory and limited nature of the encyclia in a number of different ways. In one passage, he speaks of virtue (Sarah) as a great theme which requires these as a great introduction, Cong. 11; they are the ornaments of the soul-house fitted to receive God, Cher. 99-101. In Agr. 18 the encyclia are plants for souls at the stage of youth, before manhood. In HeresHeres 275 the encyclia are equipment which Israel takes along on the journey out of the body, Egypt. 244 Philo infers this by allegorizing Abraham's age; he has been in the land of the Canaanites ten years before his union with Hagar, Gen. 16.3; he had come into Canaan at seventy-five, Gen. 12.4. The decade was a period spent in Canaan, the vices. Philo tells us that every man spends such a period after his initial birth in Egypt, the body, with its passions, pleasures and pains. Seventy-five is the age of adolescence, and the progressing mind, while able to apprehend good and evil, chooses the evil at this time. But after ten years the good mind reaches the desire for lawful discipline; Cong. 81-88. 244 Gen. 11.29. In a laconic, and unclear, passage which cites Gen. 11.29, Philo is attacking the wrongness of taking an allegorical wife for one's self, rather than receiving her for God. Since the verse quoted tells that Abraham and Nahor took wives for themselves, Philo intimates that in Abraham's case (as in the case of Jacob and Aaron) the taking of the wife meant the association with good things. Isaac and Moses, however, do not take wives purely "of themselves"; in the case of Isaac, Gen. 24.67, he first went into Sarah's tent. Philo here seems passingly trying to ward off refutations of his drush;drush; the passage, Post. 76-77, is not significant for our purposes, nor is its oblique parallel, QG IV, 145.</page><page sequence="125">[125] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 275 Abraham.245 At the behest of wisdom he resorts to the encyclia as preparation for the greater things.246 Abraham recognizes the relationship between the encyclia and philosophy247 as that of servant and mistress. This relationship must be strictly observed. The encyclia serve the mistress philosophy,248 and the mistress, in turn, rebukes the servant when, in arrogance, the servant regards herself as the mistress.249 245 Gen. 16 is the basis for this allegory, and its language is to be found throughout this paraphrase of the relevant parts of Cong. The passage, XVI, 1, is treated also in QG III, 18. See also QG III, 20. Philo discusses the allegory of Hagar passingly in LA III, 244-245; the passage has undergone textual difficulty, and we get only a beginning with Gen. 16.2 and an ending on Gen. 16.12. The contents can be conjectured as according with Philo's usual views. Another section which deals with the role of education in the progress of the individual is found in Heres 272-274, based on Gen. 15.14. See virtually the same thing, based on Gen. 15.13-14, in QG III, 10. 246 Cong. 2-14. The basis is the hearkening to Sarah of Gen. 16.2. Philo finds a shade of difference between the Greek ύπήκονσΐ which LXX reads rather than ηκουσΐ which it might have read; the former means "hearkened, obeyed," the latter only "heard." It is the LXX which provides the specific distinction Philo is here making; MT reads va-yishma', which could yield the distinction but not, of course, the specific word contrasts. In his allegory it is "virtue" which Abraham obeys. See Cong. 63-70. Philo gives us at least one contrast between Rebecca, who represents perfection, and Hagar, the gradual progress of the encyclia, rather than the usual Hagar and Sarah. In Rebecca's going down to the well, Gen. 24.15-20, she has brought with her a pitcher, whereas Hagar (Gen. 21.19) had with her a leather skin. The pitcher represents the use of reason in ridding one's self completely of the body, while the leather skin is the use of bodily vessels of self-perception, such as eyes and ears. In the passage, Post. 130-141, the example of Rebecca, the ever virgin, buttresses Philo's contrast between Sarah, restored to virginity, and Hagar. See also QG IV, 98-100. 24ל Philo in Cong, varies Sarah as Virtue, Wisdom, and Philosophy. 248 Cong. 79. See also QG III, 22, on Gen. 16.4. 249 Cong. 151. The limitation of the mind at the encyclia stage is the ability to be near to wisdom but the inability as yet not to drink from its well, as "proved" by Gen. 16.7; see QG III, 27. So somewhat similarly the words of Gen. 16.8 are a rebuke spoken to the imperfected mind running away from better judgment την άμίίνω καί κνρίαν ,γνώμην; so, too, QG III, 28· The verse portrays the angel as questioning Hagar "Whence comest thou and whither art thou going?" It must be a rebuke, not a question, for verse 11 demonstrates the omniscience of the angel, a quality which rules out the need</page><page sequence="126">276 SAMUEL SANDMEL [126] Abraham understands, as other minds do not, that the en cyclia are only preparatory stages, and therefore Abraham is not abiding with Hagar but only sojourning.250 Philo sees in the flight of Hagar (Gen. 16.6) the experience of Abraham's mind at the level of encyclical knowledge. His mind becomes ashamed at the margin of difference betwen the encyclia and true wisdom and therefore wants to flee. The angel of God encourages "Hagar" to return; the mind involved in the encyclia is urged to abide in true modesty in the presence of philosophy, the mistress.251 Abraham at this stage is still Abram, "the uplifted father"252 before his character has changed. He is pursuing the study of visible matters. His mind, still with the lower learning, has hastened to flee from the stern and gloomy life of the virtue seekers.253 Unable, however, to reach the true heights, his mind is content for the moment to continue to sojourn in the encyclia.254 But now, in its seeking, his mind en counters the angel of God, as did Hagar (Gen. 16.7) at the water for questioning; Fuga 202-205. See QG III, 18-38 for congruent explanations of Gen. 16.1-16, relating to the limitations of "Hagar." Philo sees the encyclia alluded to in Abraham's discourse with God on the number of righteous who might save Sodom, Gen. 18.24-25. The fifty, initially set forth, represent perfection; the residual ten are those who have had school training and start with a better opportunity for growth than the untrained who have not had it. See Mut. 228-229, Cong. 109, Sac. 122, and the discussion in Colson and Whitaker, I, xvi-xvii, especially the problem of rendering μίση τταιδίία. Philo treats Gen. 18.24-32 differently in QG IV, 27, limiting himself there to perfect numbers as salutary harmonies. 230 See QG III, 19 on Gen. 16.1, for Philo's longer explanation of Hagar as an Egyptian, passingly treated in Abr. 251. QG III, 21 allegorizes Gen. 16.3 congruently. The afflicting by Sarah, Gen. 16.6, is the discipline by means of which Abraham is trained to regard the encyclia in the true status, Cong. 158-160 and QG III, 24-26. Philo shows in the treatise by examples from geometry and grammar that the arts deal with the perceptible aspects of the sciences while philosophy defines the intelligible aspects, Cong. 139-150. 231 Fuga. 3-6. See also QG III, 26, 28-30. 252 This is Philo's usual etymology of Abram. 253 Colson and Whitaker, II, 481, point out correctly that Philo here inter prets Hagar not as the encyclia but rather as the mind of the sage at the stage of the encyclia. See QG III, 37 on Gen. 16 15 for Philo's clear hint in this direction. 254 Cher. 4-6.</page><page sequence="127">[127] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 277 spring.255 This spring is wisdom. His mind is no more able to drink from wisdom than was Hagar able to drink from the well.256 The progressing mind of Abraham has to return to its proper mistress and to undergo the noble humiliation which philosophy affords, the product of which is the overthrow of the irrational soul.257 At the stage of the encyclia, the best that Abraham can produce spiritually is Ishmael, sophistry, the "child" of the lower learning.258 The sophist differs from the sage in that he loves to argue for the sake of argument; he is therefore the proper target for the attacks of the representatives of the true sciences.259 The mind which has not advanced beyond sophistry «5 Fuga 177. See also QG III, 27. 256 Gen. 16.7 depicts Hagar near the spring, but does not mention her drinking from it. So too, the spring from which Rebecca, "Patience," fills her pitcher, Gen. 24.16, is divine wisdom. Gen. 14.7, (τηΎην της κρίσεως) serves Philo as proof that this divine wisdom is both holy and also, as a "sifter" in judgment, just; "the wisdom of God is both holy, containing no earthy ingredient, and is a sifting of the universe, whereby all opposites are separated from each other," Fuga 196. For the intent of Philo in the passage, see further Heres 133 ff. and note 304. 257 Fuga 202-207. Gen. 16.7, "an angel of the Lord found her," portrays the decreeing of a return home to the soul which is going astray. See Fuga 119-121 and QG III, 27. The irrational soul is the lower mind, symbolized by Masek. See note 237. 258 Fuga 208. Ishmael, meaning "hearkening to God," is lower than Israel, "seeing God," because hearing is lower than seeing. See also QG III, 23 on Gen. 16.5, and QG III, 31-32 on Gen. 16.10-11. The interpretation of Abraham's age, 86, Gen. 16.16, is found in QG III, 38. The explanation of the number is clear; the relevance is not. A further deduction that Ishmael is a sophist, or the mind at the sophist stage, stems from Ishmael's being called an archer (Gen. 21.20) "for whatever points he sets forth as a target, at this he discharges proofs like arrows." Cf. Cher. 8 ff., which cites Gen. 21.10. 258 Fuga 208-211. "Face to face with his brethren," the last part of Gen. 16.12, portray perpetual opposition faced by the sophist, Fuga 211 and QG QG III, 33. The iniquities of the Amorites of Gen. 15.16, are also sophistical arguments, destined to be supplanted by the truth. In Heres, 302 ff., which cites Gen. 15.16, and in QG, III, 13, Philo seems to be arguing against oppo nents who find in the verse support of the irreligious doctrine that fate (eίμαρ μένη)μένη) and necessity {ανάγκη), rather than God, direct the destiny of events. QG QG IV, 95 is obscure. It seems to point out some difference between sage and sophist, but the passage is corrupt.</page><page sequence="128">278 SAMUEL SANDMEL [128] sees the angel of God, but not God himself; it sees only a re flection, but it wrongly thinks it is seeing the true vision.260 In conceiving of Abraham as one who has mastered the en cyclia, Philo makes Abraham appear to have studied grammar, geometry, astronomy, rhetoric, music, and other branches of study.261 260 pUga 212. Philo allegorizes the locale of the incident of Hagar's flight. Between Kadesh and Bered (between "holy" and "evil") is the stage of the mind when it is on the border between holy and profane things, fleeing from bad things but not yet competent to share the life of perfect goodness; Fuga. 213. The meaning of the LXX rendering of beer lahai rot of Gen. 16.14 is obscure. LXX reads φρίαρ ου ΐνώτιov Ibov. Philo seems to take LXX to mean that the progressing soul dipping into school-knowledge sees reflected in it, as in a mirror, God, the author of that knowledge. Colson and Whitaker find the passage, Fuga 212, difficult, possibly through not noting "reflection in the mirror" of Fuga 213 as the key to the passage. The passage means, I think, that the mind at the stage of sophistry sees not God but a dim reflec tion. Hence, 212 uses the contrast between the freeborn who sees God Himself and the slaveborn which sees only an angel of God but calls it God. The passage is rather well duplicated in QG III, 35, to which Marcus adds the correct note that the traditional Jewish interpretation is "the well of the Living One who sees me"; LXX translators, says Marcus, "took Heb. lahay as the noun lehi 'cheek' in the sense of 'before my face.' " Philo Supplement I, 233, note e. In the same verse between Kadesh and Bered, "holy" and "evil," means that he who is in gradual progress is on the borderland between the holy and the profane; so Fug a 213. In QG III, 36 one reads Pharan rather than Bered, and there Pharan is rendered as "hail" or "dots." As Marcus ad loc. notes, hail would accord with Bered· but in Fuga it is as though Philo read "ע)?; to this Heinemann (German Translation VI, 103) remarks: "Die Ubersetzung 'unter ijbeln' mochte man am ehesten so erklaren, dass Philos Vorganger ברע = ברד ברד setzt und den Dental am Schluss so auffasst wie in Elisabeth = אלישבע." Onk. renders the names רקם and חגרא, while Jon. reads for the last חלוצה; Onk. rendered Shur in Gen. 16.7 as Hagro, while Jon. rendered Shur of Ex. 15.22 as Haluza; cf. Rosenberg, אוצר השמות, I, 397. Reverting to the passage in Fuga 212, Philo quotes Gen. 16.13 'n Somn. I, 240, as proof from the experience of Abraham that Jacob also, in his pro gressing stage though before his perfection, saw not the Supreme Cause but the Logos, while Hagar saw the angel; so, slightly differently, also in QG III, 34· 261 This is the list given in Cong. 11. Other lists given by Philo, according to Colson and Whitaker, IV, p. 577, omit astronomy; they suggest that the motive for the omission was the assumption that astronomy was part of</page><page sequence="129">[129] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 279 Abraham would not have been a lofty man, if he had lingered over-long, as some do, in the encyclical studies.262 An affection for sense perception pulls back the human soul from its rise to God.263 There was a stage at which Abraham was wavering bet ween progress and being pulled back.264 His mind consisted of two parts, the incorruptible and senior part (represented by the seventy) and the junior part,265 the five senses. This junior part geometry. Drummond (I, 263-266) ascribes a conscious motive for the usual omission: astronomers were in Philo's view "only wasting their gifts upon barren speculations. For, in the first place, their inquiries contributed nothing to the true end of life ... In the second place, the questions with which astronomy deals are beyond the powers of human thought"; see Mig. 184. While elsewhere Philo may feel free to omit astronomy, he must include it as an attainment of Abraham for the reason that when we first encounter Philo's Abram he is an astronomer. Yet the inclusion of the subject here does not refute Drummond's view. Philo condemns the Chaldeans as astronomers with considerable force, Abr. 69-70. The usual interpretations of these attacks are that they are directed at the Stoics: Goodenough, 138; Wolfson II, 78, and Bréhier, 165; see, however, W. L. Knox's review of Wolfson's Philo, in Journal of of Theological Studies, XLIX (1948), 211-12 for an insistence that this identifi cation is too simple, and overlooks the astral determinism of the period. Philo seems to have believed that the stars could foretell, Moses II, 126; LA LA I, 8, and Op'.f. 58. But there is a difference between the ability to foretell and the ability to control. Ascription of ruling power to the stars would be to Philo atheism. 262 Cong. 77-78. 262 Philo divides men into three kinds: the first looks God-ward; the second looks toward created things; the third is a mixture of the two. The first kind has never submitted to the necessities of the body; Wolfson equates this class with unbodied souls or angels, I, 366-370. The second class does not seek to rise. The third class seeks in its better part, but it is pulled back by the worse; Heres 45-53. 26י• Philo's basis is Abraham's age, Gen. 12.4, on leaving Haran. Seventy five represents the borderline between perceptible and intelligible knowledge, Mig.Mig. 198-199. (Philo has alluded to the verse in connection with Abraham's age as implicitly eighty-five a decade later, and he has given, as we saw above, a different meaning to seventy-five.) 215'52י' Mig. 198-199, QG IV, 30 contrasts the vision, at noon of Gen. 18.1 and evening of 19.1. Gen. 19.17 ff. yield views of the defects in Lot. The injunction of Gen. 19.17 (QG IV, 45) are for the wavering man, who has already had ample explanation now to move by himself. The mountain, QG IV, 46, is wisdom to which the progressing soul may flee to escape destruction in the death of the body. Philo's exegesis flows from LXX; it would be difficult on</page><page sequence="130">280 SAMUEL SANDMEL [130] was also represented by Lot.266 Abraham was on the borderline between the perceptible world and the intelligible, having not yet completely divorced himself from the perceptible. The junior part of the soul267 was devoted, as was Lot, to herds and ma terial things (Gen. 13.5). The herds of Abraham, however, were the principles of the seperate virtues. These two parts of the soul were in conflict within Abraham, and the conflict remained as long as the higher soul was not purified. The higher soul in Abraham finally triumphs and it bids (Gen. 13.9) the lower part to move off.268 Abraham prefers to have as his companions "good natural ability" and the "love of vision,"269 rather than the the basis of MT. Lot, being imperfect, cannot get to the mountain, Gen. 19.18-20 (QG IV, 47), but must flee to the city "which is small and is not small." See above, note 104. In LXX and MT as Marcus I, 322, note k remarks, the "is not small" is interrogative. Philo here is greatly removed from the rabbis; cf. Rashi ad loc., Shab. 10b; and see Ginzberg I, 252 and 256 and V, 243. It does not seem to me that Marcus is right (I, 322, note k) in asserting that the allegory in QG IV, 47, is different from Abr. 166; rather, it is more extended and less focused, but still quite similar. The first part of Gen. 19.22 is, in QG IV, 49, the encouragement to the wavering mind to be steadfast in its progress. The exact intent of Philo in QG QG IV, 50 to the second part of the verse eludes me. His translation of Zoor as mountain betrays no recognition of the paronomasia in MT ; cf. Rashi ad ad loc.-, it can hardly rest on Gen. 19.30, where Philo infers that Lot feared to remain in Ço'ar and hence went up to the mountain. The rabbis infer dis obedience from the act of Lot; see Kasher, III, 816, note 176. One wonders if QG QG IV, 50 may not be interpolated into Philo. 256 The etymology of the name means "inclining"; Mig. 13-14. 26' Philo does not say so in this context, but he is giving here a contrast between what, as we saw above, he called the "whole soul," which is animal, irrational, and material, and the immaterial, rational part of the soul. 268 Abr. 217-224. 26' Eshkol and Aner are so interpreted. Gen. 14.24. Perhaps ability in eludes memory. The use of memory in learning is touched on several times. One passage gets to the topic rather tortuously. In Abraham's prayer for Sodom, Philo focuses on the ten righteous men who, if found in Sodom, might have saved the city. His discussion is in the context of several related scrip tural mentions of ten. First he demonstrates that by Scripture, Gen. 16.3, the ten years which elapsed between the arrival in Canaan and Sarah's gift of Hagar, symbolize the transition from boyhood to adolescence; Egypt is the vice of boyhood, Canaan the vice of adolescence. ". . . Only after a time and</page><page sequence="131">[131] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 281 quality personified by Lot. The possession of these good com panions leads to the possession of the contemplative life.270 Abraham, then, has utilized sense-perception as a servant, extracting from it the good which it could furnish, but refusing to remain at this stage. His circumcision, Gen. 17, is his con elusive pruning off of the appetites of the body.271 c. Reason The instrumentality by which Abraham conquers his senses and his passions is reason.272 In going beyond the senses, Abraham has come to the stage of the mind.2" The experience of Abraham under the perfect number ten do we reach the desire for the lawful discipline which can profit us"; Cong. 88. The use of ten in scriptural passages is then alluded to, including Abraham's conquest of the nine kings — the ten resulting from adding Abraham to the nine! Sodom is the soul barren of good and blind of reason ; Abraham prayed that if in it there was some token of righteousness, it might receive some remission of punishment. See Cong. 109. Thereafter, the ten camels which Abraham's servant (whom the rabbis, Yoma 28b, identify with the Eliezer of Gen. 15.2) takes as a gift, are interpreted to be the count less memories of his master, Cong, hi and QG IV, 92; Rebekkah waters these camels, that is, virtue emptied all her pitcher, or teacher's knowledge, into the soul of the learner; the camel is memory because it is a ruminating animal which softens its food by chewing the cud; moreover, when it has knelt and has a heavy load on it, it nimbly raises itself with astonishing agility. In this latter passage, Post. 148-152, the allegory has virtually eliminated the distinction between Abraham and the servant; it discusses memory as part of the education of the progressing soul; see, similarly, QG IV, 94, the camels of Gen. 24.11 and Philo's discussion there of memory. 270 Philo interprets Mamre as a place name, deriving it from the root, meaning "to see." MT and the rabbis take Mamre as a person. Cf. Colson and Whitaker, IV, p. 227, note c. The passage is Mig. 164-165. In QG IV, I, Mamre means "from sight." 271 QG III, 46-52. 272 In the allegory of Gen. 14, the five senses and the four passions are conquered by reason, represented allegorically by Melchizedek, Abr. 235 and 244. In another passage, Melchizedek represents "democratic" reason, the mind which steers a middle course between despotism and lawlessness, there after providing, in a priestly fashion, food for an even loftier ascent by the soul; LA III, 81. A similar association of Melchizedek with reason is found in Cong.Cong. 98-99. 275 Goodenough points out that there is a great variety of descriptions in</page><page sequence="132">282 SAMUEL SANDMEL [132] was different from that of Adam. Originally Adam had been made of pure material and had been endowed with a copy of divine reason; he associated with divine natures and for a while he passed his time in blessedness. But Adam was fundamentally earth-born.274 With the appearance of Eve (pleasure) Adam sue cumbed to the senses, and set mankind off on a downward course that continued for his descendants.275 These descendants, how ever, retain some marks of the original forms in which Adam was created; every man, in respect of his mind is allied to the divine reason (Logos), but in respect to his body is allied to the world.276 Abraham was heaven-born. Originally as an astrologer he had busied himself with the visible world,277 but once risen to a better nature he becomes an exemplar of the reasoning of the good man.278 Abraham's change in name from Abram is a transition from his preoccupation with his lower mind to his use of his higher reason.279 Philo of the mind, and some of the descriptions seem contradictory of others. Similarly, Drummond, I, 322-323 and Wolfson, I, 362, enumerate the use of such terms as vovs, διάνοια and λογισμό?. Goodenough, 383, and Wolfson I,I, 393, demonstrate that Philo also uses logos as a term for the mind. Good enough is exactly right in saying that "if Philo despaired of an exact knowledge of the vovs ηΎίμών, he says many instructive things about it." In part the variety in terms seems to be due to the variety of allegorical figures by which Philo derives his doctrine. Thus, for example, Laban, the brother of Rebekkah, Gen. 24.29, is for Philo the irrational mind ("white ness," the symbol of honors given to sense perception) which is the brother to "constancy," the rational mind. See QG IV, 116-119 on Gen. 24.28-31. 274 Opif. 134 ff. and Heres 52, 57. See also QG I, 4 for an exposition of Philo's two Adams. Drummond has an excellent discussion, II, 175 ff., of the distinction between "made," generic man, and "moulded," specific. 27' Opif. 151-156. 276 Opif. 145-146. 277 That is, while he was still Abram. 278 This is the interpretation Philo gives in one passage to the import of the etymology of "Abraham," as distinct from "Abram," Gig. 62-64. 274 Gig. 62-64. The change of name is consistently interpreted by Philo as an alteration in Abraham's character. The basic change is from astrology, with its contemplation of the visible world, to a contemplation of the invisible world. Philo gives a number of slightly different imports in various treatises to the change. The "migration" of Abraham is a series of steps between the Abram phase to the Abraham phase, as we shall see in detail.</page><page sequence="133">[133] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 283 This lower reason is human, the higher reason divine. The lower reason dwells among the multitudes, the higher reason seeks out loneliness.280 It has been Abraham's experience to go beyond lower reason. He has accomplished this by his migrating from it.281 Though Abraham rises above speech, into higher reason, his speech is noticeably blessed. He is able to refute the sophist, a capacity beyond Abel, whose speech was so poor that Abel was unable to refute Cain, the poorer mind with the better speech.282 His speech is definitely not that of the sophist.283 It is essential for Abraham to have good speech, since poor speech is a bad interpreter of good thoughts.28'1 Speech is a derivative manifestation of the higher reason and is not a pure and identical projection of it.285 280 Heres. 126-127. In another figure Philo speaks of man's mind being in the third position from God, with divine reason (Logos) being in the middle position, Heres 230-231. Again, the reasoning power in man and the divine Logos are indivisible from each other, Ibid. 235. The figure of loneliness recalls Abr.Abr. 66, that Abraham departed from Chaldea "with a few or even alone." 281 Abraham left his father's house. "Speech" (λόγο? κατά προ φοράν) Mig.Mig. 2. Philo has to point out the sense in which the mind, the seat of reason, can be called a house; it is as true, he says, for man as it is for God, citing the house of God, Gen. 28.17, as a proof-text; cf. Somn. I, 32. In another passage, dealing not with Abraham but with priests, Philo praises these men who cut away (based on Ex. 32.29) the body, the love of passion, the company of senses, and finally "speech." Speech must be excised because it is the medium through which the specious, the probable, and the persuasive implant false opinions; Ebr. 69-70. Speech is inconstant with and divisive of the unity of higher reason, Gig. 52. Such sentiments are frequent in Philo. 282 Mig. 74-75. The intent of Gen. 24.3, is that speech, the "servant, shall not deceive the perfect mind," Isaac, QG IV, 88; such, too, in QG IV, 89 is the instruction not to take Isaac back to Chaldean astrology, Gen. 24.5-6. The angel of Gen. 24.7 is the joining of another logos to "uttered logos," QG QG IV, 90. Rebekkah might be willing to return with this other logos, but not with the "uttered" logos, QG IV, 91 to Gen. 24.8. 28נ Mig. 82-85. Ishmael, as we saw above, is the sophist. He always re mains a sophist, Cher. 10; cf. Sob. 9, Heres 302 fL, and Moses II, 212. 284 Mig. 72. 285 Mig. 76-79. Philo distinguishes, as noted, in several passages between speech and inner thought, the logos προφορικός and the ίνδιαθίτος, a distinction which seems to be Stoic; cf. Colson and Whitaker, II, p. 502. The interpretation of Gen. 24 in QG reads as if it is a series of notes out of which an essay might have been written on the relationship of the endiathetos</page><page sequence="134">284 SAMUEL SANDMEL [134J Abraham passes beyond lower reason, just as he migrated beyond body and sense perception. He rises superior to these, treating them as a king treats his subjects, ruling them and not being ruled by them.286 Now that he is in possession of the higher mind, Abraham receives five gifts:287 first he is able to see the land,288 "wisdom."289 Second, he is able to progress in virtues.290 The third gift is an improvement in uttered word and inner thought.291 The fourth and prophorikos. See QG IV, 96 to Gen. 24.15. Also, QG IV, 85 to Gen. 24.2, in which the "servant" is speech, and Abraham the master mind. So, too, QG QG IV, 120 to Gen. 24.34. In Moses II, 127 Philo applies the two aspects to the double breast-plate of the high priest. The logos endiathetos, he says, is the source of reason, located in the nous hegemonikos, while the prophorikos is the stream flowing from it and located in the tongue, the mouth and the other organs of speech. Cf. Goodenough, 100 ff., for his insistence, with Drummond, that the divine Logos is singular, against Gfôrer, Heinze, and Pascher, who think of a double divine Logos■, according to Goodenough the human logos is indeed double, but the divine Logos singular. Philo gives still another example in his interpretation of Ex. 4.14, which assigns to Aaron the task of being the "mouth" of Moses; Aaron is "speech," the brother of "reason," Deter. 126-129. 286 Mig. 7-8. 287 "Covenant" in Mut. 52-53, is the symbol of grace which God sets between Himself who offers it and the soul who receives it. Philo alludes to having dealt with the whole subject of covenants in two treatises. Schuerer, II, III, 337 concludes from the absence of these works in Eusebius' list in H.H. 1?.. ii 18.13 that they were by then already lost. Another allusion to the work is found in QE II, 34. In one passage, Spec. II, 16, scholars propose an emendation which would there eliminate the word covenant; but even for those who want to retain the word, it has in the passage a necessary connota tion of will, not mutual contract. There are references in Deter. 68 and Sac. 57, the latter repeating that "covenant" allegorically is God's grace. In QG III, 10 "covenant" is the rational class of possessions which God bestows on the soul; in QG III, 40, based on Gen. 17.1-2, they are "incorporeal principles . . • of which this world is made . . ."; so, too, QG III, 42, quite similarly. QG III, 60 based on Gen. 17.21, contrasts Isaac, the heir to the divine testament (cov enant), with Ishmael, not an heir but only the recipient of gifts from the heir; Isaac "receives gifts which are bestowed by grace." 288 Gen. 12.1, is Philo's basis. 28י Mig. 28 and 36. "Seeing," the quality of the wise, is the contemplative life, the most appropriate life for the rational being; Mig. 47; cf. Abr. 22-24. 20י The "nation" of Gen. 12.2. 2,1 Philo derives this from the LXX rendering of "be thou a blessing," Mig. 70-71.</page><page sequence="135">[135] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 285 is a good reputation for virtue.2'2 The fifth is the gift of actually being that which good reputation reports.2'3 The possession of this higher reason climaxed Abraham's cut ting away from himself all material things, and freed his mind to fly upward to God with his understanding stripped of material trammels.2'4 Reason teaches him that God is the source of all gifts, and Abraham will no longer accept material things.2'5 Abraham is able to reason correctly not only in one direction but in all directions; therefore Scripture terms him an "elder, advanced in years,"2'6 whom God blessed in everything. Through 292 Mig. 86-93■ Philo applies "reputation" to the fulfillment of the literal Mosaic laws. 293 Mig. 106. See also QG IV, 7, to Gen. 18.5. In another passage Philo commends the careful examination of "appearance," especially related to the sacred legislation, since appearances can deceive as to vice or virtue; Philo derives this from Gen. 18.21; see QG IV, 24. Philo infers from Gen. 12.3 that credit is due to him who praises the good man and blame to him who blames him, Mig. 109-119, as his prelude to a view, found often, that a city or country or region has benefited through a single man, Mig. 120 ff. Mig.Mig. 107 quotes Gen. 12.2, inferring from eulogetos, rather than eulogeme nos,nos, the difference between praise by God and praise by man. The latter can rest on mere opinion; the former must rest on truth. 294 Cher. 31. Philo so allegorizes the fire and the knife ("reason" and "cutting away") of Gen. 22.6. For the hellenistic background of the notion cf rising above corporeality, see Wendland, "Hellenistic Ideas of Salvation in the Light of Ancient Anthropology," in American Journal of Theology, XVII (1913), 345-349• 295 Ebr. 105-106. The passage being interpreted is Gen. 14.22-23, Abra ham's stretching forth his hand to God that he will take nothing from the king of Sodom. Abraham in the passage has just conquered the four passions and five senses. The gifts offered, Gen. 14.21-22, by the king of Sodom, things without reason, in exchange for "the men," things with reasons, are refused by the sage. To such a sage, God reveals his secret mysteries, Gen. 18.17. See LA III, 23-27 and QG IV, 21. Philo reverts passingly to Gen. 14.21-22 in LA III, 196-197, adding an allusion to Gen. 25.6: Abraham retains the property which had come to him from God, but gets rid of the horses of the king of Sodom and also the possessions of the concubines. Gen. 25.6 is similarly treated in QG IV, 148-149. See also the rendering of aûrcS in LXX Gen. 15.10 in QG III, 4. The pious soul takes for Him (God), that is, it attributes to God, not to himself (as the natural sense of the verse reads) good and precious gifts. 296 Gen. 24.1. Similarly QG IV, 14 interprets Gen. 18.11. QG IV, 15°152־</page><page sequence="136">286 SAMUEL SANDMEL [136] the watchful care of God, the rational part of his soul has triumphed.297 Abraham walks in the path of right reason;298 he enters deal with the same idea, though #150 is not intelligible. Elsewhere, Sob. 7-9, Philo cites another proof that "younger" and "older" have nothing to do with age. Hagar's ability to carry on her shoulder an Ishmael presumably some twenty years older than Isaac and to allude to her son as a child (Gen. 21.14-16) are his scriptural proof that Isaac is "older" than Ishmael. Isaac was circumcised when Ishmael was thirteen and was weaned from milk when he was seven; ergo Ishmael was twenty-one. Isaac is the heir of wisdom, but Ishmael of sophistry. I have found no parallel in the rabbis to Philo's assump tion that the weaning took place at seven years; Kasher (Tor ah Shelemah, III, 845) mentions two interpretations, one of which would make Isaac twenty-four months, the other thirteen years) ; PRE XXX makes Ishmael twenty-four and Isaac ten: Gen. R. LI 11 makes Ishmael twenty-seven, and ascribes Hagar's ability to carry him to his wasting away from an illness induced through an evil eye put on him by Sarah. Sob. 17-18. See also QG IV, 83-84, based on Gen. 23.19 and 24.1. »98 By way Gf contrast with right reason, Lot ("inclination") is on occa sion symbolic of the man with the false idea of his wisdom; he is joined to "custom," which — Gen. 19.26 — is turned to stone (not salt!) and is hostile to truth, for she lags behind to gaze at familiar objects. The elder daughter is "deliberation," the younger "assent"; when the mind has turned to assent, especially to hostile suggestions, then deliberation has ceased. A sober mind would not tolerate this, but the drunken mind does; hence Gen. 19.33, "they gave their father wine to drink." That such a mind does not grasp funda mentals clearly is demonstrated by Gen. 19.35, "he knew not when they slept and rose up." See Philo's complex discussion in Ebr. 162-205; the item is presented in shorter form in Post. 172 ff.; see also QG IV, 52, and, somewhat differently, QG IV, 55-56. Philo is discussing the advance made by the soul towards perfection. The enlargement of the mind goes by steps towards perfection, ten from Seth to Noah; a second and better one in the ten from Shem to Abraham; seven from Abraham to Moses; this latter does not "haunt the outer court of the Holy Place as one seeking initiation, but as a sacred guide (hierophant) has his abode in the sanctuary." In contrast to this upward surge, Lot, wavering, went downward, for Deliberation and Consent (syn kathesis,kathesis, where Ebr. 165 reads synainesis) desired to have children by the mind, their father, rather than from God, as was Seth, Gen. 4.26. Philo in his two allusions to Lot's wife in Gen. 19.26 in the Allegory, Fuga 121 121 and Ebr. 164, omits the salt, but uses it in QG IV, 52 as a symbol of unproductivity. In Ebr. 164 the wife is custom which lags behind and is hostile to truth; in Fuga 121 she is the symbol of the laxness in a student which impels him to turn away from the teacher and face backwards. On custom as a "feminine" barrier to truth, see Ebr. 54 ff. Philo in other passages</page><page sequence="137">[137] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 287 virtue's path. He follows God and is mindful of His injunctions. Since the injunctions are right reason, the verse "Abraham did all My law," means that Abraham "did" the divine reason.2" The actions of Abraham are the logoi of God.300 Abraham governs himself like a father; his mind does not grant to the soul the thing pleasant to it, nor frighten the soul with threats.301 The mind must so govern because it can only rise above its material com ponent, it cannot be severed from it, for such severance would simply mean death.302 Similarly, one must not sever himself from the literal law, but should rise above the literal law (the body) to the soul of the law (the allegorical).303 commends custom highly (e. g. Spec. IV, 149-150). What he seems to oppose is custom when it obstructs truth or right reason. ייג LXX reads 4&lt;ρύλαξί which Philo quotes as ίποίησε, Gen. 26.5. Of the four items in the verse προστάγματα and tVT0\as allude to obligations to God, while the δικαιώματα and νόμιμα, to man, QG IV, 184, Heres 8, and Mig.Mig. 130. See above, on Abr. 275, note 202. Philo, in an obliquely related passage, comments on Gen. 19.16, about the angels who take the dazed and confused daughters of Lot by the hand, that souls governed by "holy thoughts" can be saved if having taken hold, they continue to hold on, QG IV, 44. (On some of the variations between MT and LXX of this verse, see Marcus I, 318, note g. The singular ויתמהסה, is rendered by the plural ΐταράχθησαν, they were confused, as though from תמה/\־. Gen.Gen. R. VI plays on the word also inferring confusion (prion), or rather con fused tarrying, resulting from Lot's regret over the losses of money and jewels soon to occur. In Philo Lot in this section appears favorably; among the rabbis, e. g. Rashi, he is regarded unfavorably, his benefits accruing solely from Abraham's merit.) Philo points admiringly to the rescue of the progressing man, QG IV, 51 to Gen. 19.23-24, at the same moment that evil-doers are being destroyed. In QG IV, 101-114 the servant of Gen. 24 is also the symbol of the progressing man who absorbs teaching from "Rebekkah" in proportion to his capacity; the sequence of Philo's view on Gen. 24.18-27 is parallel in content to much of Cong. The "progressing mind" is in touch with divine reason; the sage, however, "does" the divine reason. 300 Philo is interpreting Gen. 12.4, Mig. 127-130. He has expressed exactly this same idea in Abr. 4-5, where he applied to Abraham the epithet nomos empsychosempsychos kai logikos. See also the obliquely related passages in QG III, 15 and Heres 308-312. 301 LA III, 83-84. In Abr. 242, Philo calls this establishing democracy in the soul. 302 Mig. 7. 303 It will be recalled in this connection that the literal laws, the spe</page><page sequence="138">288 SAMUEL SANDMEL [138] Abraham has the power of acute discrimination by means of his reason.304 Since divine reason has separated and apportioned all things in nature, the higher reason is able to participate in such separation and in a subsequent classification and inter pretation. Abraham is able to distinguish direct opposites and lesser gradations in both the material and the immaterial world.305 Since he has subdued his lower mind, and has freed his higher mind by regimenting his bodily attributes, he is now able to direct himself to the world of intelligible matters.306 d. Speculative Philosophy Abraham becomes a speculative philosopher. He has passed be yond the encyclia into the realm of knowledge, as opposed to art.307 Examples of arts are music and grammar; these use the eyes and the ears. Knowledge, however, utilizes the mind. The arts deal with detached items from nature, while philosophy deals with the whole nature of existing things.308 The sense in which Abraham is a philosopher is discernible in the contrast which Philo draws between Sarah and Hagar in DeDe Congressu. The encyclia are bodily matters, but prudence and wisdom {φρόνησα and €7ηστήμη) are to be found among the reasoning faculties. Abraham accordingly holds wisdom and knowledge to be more honorable than the encyclia.309 Because he is a philosopher he spends his days in continued well-being cific ones, are only copies of the natural law which Abraham obeyed; Abr.Abr.Abr.Abr. 3-4. 3°4 Philo infers that the "dividing" of Gen. 15.10, is a description of the logos logos tomeus, Heres 130-136.

Drummond, II, 168; and Goodenough, "A Neo-Pythagorean Source in Philo Judaeus," YCS III, 1932, 115-164■ 303 Heres 234-236. 306 See Philo's interpretation of Gen. 18.10 in QG IV, 12, derived from the LXX rendering of כעת חיה. See Marcus' notes, Philo Supplement I, 285, for the different forms of the rendering in Philo. 307 Art is defined as a system of conceptions coordinated to work for some useful end, a definition which Colson and Whitaker take to be Stoic, IV, 580. 308 Cong. 140-147. 3"' Cong. 153-156.

The Intelligible World Abraham has begun as a man possessing specific virtues.312 He was temperate, prudent, brave, and just. Such virtues, being 310 Cong. 174. Philo tells us in this same passage that the multitude do not recognize the happy lot of the philosopher. It must be remarked that on the surface Philo is considerably less than consistent in his attitude towards philosophy, or else he uses the term in differing connotations. He dismisses as insignificant, for example, the fact that "hardly a day passes but the lecture-halls and theatres are filled with philosophers discoursing at length, stringing together without stopping to take breath their disquisitions on virtue. But what profit is there in their talk?" Some of the audience do not really listen, and some who listen do not truly absorb, and some absorb only an echo of what is said. Abraham, however, really absorbed philosophy, since he hearkened, Gen. 16.2, to the voice of Sarah; see Cong. 52-53, 64-66. In another passage he goes further, terming as sophists the philosophers of schools identified as the Peripatetics. Stoics and Epicureans, Eleatics, Sceptics, and non-Sceptics; cf. Colson and Whitaker, IV, p. 574. Bréhier points out that for Philo the knowledge of God is something apart from and above philosophy, p. 294; cf. Cong. 79-80. In another passage, LA I, 57, philosophy is the road that leads into virtue, and is subdivisible into logic, ethics and physics; some of the ancients likened the physical part to plants, the logical to walls and fences, and the ethical to the fruits of the plants; Mut. 73-76. See also QG IV, 87 to Gen. 24.3. "נ Mut. 75-76. Philo makes it abundantly clear that true philosophy is concerned not only with information but with morals and ethics. The moral duties are the specific virtues and copies of the generic virtues. These generic virtues, planted in the soul, lead to specific activities, LA I, 56-57. Abraham's fear of being childless, Gen. 15.2 refers to his soul, that its moral excellence might not come to naught, Heres 34 ff. Philo interprets Abraham's speech as a question, not as a statement. The passage seems to veer between the literal and allegorical. 312 Cher. 5 and frequently. Sarah, like Lot and llagar, varies in Philo's exposition. She is sometimes philosophy, as in Cong. She is, as Sarah, generic virtue, in contrast to Sarai, specific virtues. Like Lot and Hagar she often seems, allegorically, not to be a person in her own right, but to be merely a quality or characteristic of Abraham. Lot, we saw, at times was Abraham's lower mind; Hagar was Abraham's progressing mind; Sarai is Abraham's</page><page sequence="140">290 SAMUEL SANDMEL [140] specific, are perishable.313 The change of name from Abram to Abraham means a change in the nature of the patriarch; he is no longer concerned with the visible world but with the intel ligible world.3'4 Specific virtues are part of the perceptible world, being the property of men and perishing with men; generic virtue belongs in the intelligible world, the immaterial world, since it is imperishable. The change in Sarah's name3'5 represents the ethical change in Abraham. His concern is no longer simply the observable virtues of different men, but the intelligible vir tue of which these specific virtues are only the copy.3'6 Generic virtue is an idea.3'7 As a possession of Abraham, his generic virtue is bound to have a "nation" of virtues in the perceptible specific virtues, and Sarah, Abraham's generic virtues. Isaac, in part, is Abraham's joy. In taking Sarah to himself (Gen. 11.29) Abraham took a good thing, in contrast with worthless men who take to themselves evils, men such as Lamech, Post. 75-76. 3!3ניג Cher. 4-6; Mut. 77 ff. 34י43י Abram means "uplifted father"; uplifted, in that Abraham dealt with astrology; father, in that astrology in a limited sense yields some results. Abraham means "elect father of sound"; "father of sound" is the mind, "elect" connotes that it is a wise mind; Mut. 66-71; Cher. 4; Gig. 62-64, QGQG III, 43· ns From Sarai, specific virtues, to Sarah, generic virtue. See QG III, 53· 316 Mut. 79-80. Philo has several figures for virtue in addition to Sarah. It is the tree of life, LA I, 59; it is, Gen. 2.10-14, the river flowing from Eden, dividing into the four specific virtues, LA I, 63-64; see QG I, 12. It is the Tent of Testimony, Deter. 160 ff. Philo gives this schematization in LA I, 63 ff.: generic virtue issues out of the Sophia of God; specific virtues issue out of ge neric virtue. The Sophia of God, Philo tells us, is the Logos of God. Generic virtue is goodness ά-γαθότης. The four rivers are prudence, φρύνησίί, con cerned with things to be done; courage, ανδρύa, with things to be endured; self mastery, σωφροσύνη, with things to be chosen, and justice, δικαιοσύνη with things to be rewarded. The first three of these belong each to a part of the body: prudence belongs to the head, the seat of reason; courage belongs to the breast, the seat of passion; self-mastery belongs to the abdomen, the seat of lust. When these three are in harmony in the soul, the fourth, justice, appears. דיג Mut. 148. Since generic virtue is within the intelligible world, and by virtue of being intelligible is archetypal, it is natural that Philo regard it as an idea. For a discussion of Philo's view of ideas, see Brehier, 152-153.</page><page sequence="141">[141] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 291 world.318 Abraham's possession of the four cardinal virtues319 of the perceptible world is the direct result of his possessing in his mind generic virtue. The possession of such virtue leads Abraham to become the best kind of king, the philosopher king, appointed not by men but by Nature herself.320 The transformed Abraham, then, is no longer the "atheist" of his Chaldean days. He is now com pletely transformed into the Sage, in possession of archetypal virtue. As a result of the change in his nature, he is now in full possession of piety.321 Abraham's faith in God, the mark of his piety, is firmly established.322 That a doubt passed through his mind momentarily 18ג Philo is interpreting "she shall be for nations," Gen. 17.16, Mut. 148 ff. and QG III, 44. 3" The theme of the second half of De Abrahamo. 3™ Mut. 151. Philo adds that the teaching that the Sage is the only true king stems from Moses. This sceptre is a gift of God to Abraham, Sob. 57. Wisdom is the true kingship and is impossible while one lingers among bodily things; Mig. 197. Virtue is a rulership and kingship whose authority is final, Somn.Somn. II, 244. The epithet for Abraham, with a similar explanation, was noted above in Abr. 261. The verse which serves Philo is Gen. 23.6 (QG IV, 76) a verse which in MT reads נשיא rather than the βασιΧίύς of LXX. The notion of the kingship of the sage seems to be intimately associated with Philo's notion of democracy in the soul, though Philo does not, to my knowledge, make this association directly. Democracy, as we saw above, meant a regi mentation of the passions and the senses by the mind, which acted neither as a tyrant, abusing his subjects, nor as a weak sovereign, capitulating to the wishes of the mob. The connection between democracy and the sage as king is that "reason" is the means by which the members of the body are regulated; when this regulation takes place, democracy has been established, and the soul has become the sage and king. Cf. Goodenough, Introduction to Philo Judaeus,Judaeus, 154 ff. 3" Mut. 76. We saw above, in the literal Abraham, that piety is regarded by Philo as the outstanding characteristic of Abraham. Philo derives Abra ham's piety primarily from LXX Gen. 17.1, "Be well-pleasing before me." "Before" means that the one who practices piety towards God loves his fellowman, Mut. 39-40. 3" Philo dwells at length on Abraham's faith in God and his concomitant distrust of created things. He derives this from Gen. 17.18, "Let this Ishmael live before thee." Ishmael, elsewhere the sophist, is here the mind which hears creature wisdom rather than divine wisdom. See Mut. 201 ff. and 216 ff., also QG III, 57. As the son of Hagar, Ishmael is the progenitor of the early branches</page><page sequence="142">292 SAMUEL SANDMEL [142] distinguished Abraham's faith from divine faith.323 Even though Abraham's faith so swerved, the doubt was, in accord with his nature, short and momentary.324 The transformation which occurs is a divine gift in the form of betterment of soul ; God has called of learning (Gen. 17.20 f.), but is contrasted with "joy" whom virtue (Sarah) bears, QG III, 59. The "season" at which "joy" is to be born is God Himself, Mut.Mut. 264-266; "in another year" is not an interval of time but archetypal time, that is, eternity; virtue in general is to perceptible virtues as eternity is to perceptible time, Mut. 267-269. See also QG III, 59, the last phrase of which is lost on me. Possibly some corruption in the text, from the Greek into the Armenian, occasions the unclarity. 3« Mut. 177-178. The doubt is inferred from Gen. 17.17, Abraham's laughter at the promise of a son in view of his and Sarah's advanced age. On the other hand, however, Philo, having eulogized Abraham's faith based on Gen. 15.6, treats the substance of Gen. 15.8 as if in no way modifying that high faith. The question, "By what shall I know?" expresses no doubt at all, but only curiosity as to the manner of eventuation of God's prediction, QG QG III, 2. In Nedarim 32a, Gen. 15.8 is interpreted as expressing doubt, and it is the ultimate reason for the enslavement of Abraham's descendants in Egypt; the interpretation here is quite at variance with Philo's. The same passage quotes another sage who ascribed the punishment to Abraham's forced impressment of disciples of the wise into his "army," based on a fanciful interpretation of Gen. 14.14B. In Gen. R. XLIV, there is a denial that Gen. 15.8 expressed doubt; rather, it inquired, "through what merit?" But most rabbinic interpretation assumes that the verse expresses doubt; see Kasher, III, 644-645. Having justified Abraham, Philo proceeds to show that Gen. 15.9, "take for Me," is the proof that there is no doubt expressed in the verse; these words are the injunction for the sage to use God's gifts as a trust (which man may take for himself); see Heres 90 ff. Philo next proceeds to show that Gen. 15.10, «'Abraham took all these things for Him," means that "the man of worth guards the sacred trust ... of soul, sense, and speech, of divine wisdom and human knowledge, . . . not for himself, but solely for Him" — that is, the "Him" (αΰτω) is God, Heres 129. 324 Mut. 186. See also QG IV, 86 to Gen. 24.2, the allegory of the "thigh." Gen. 15.4, והנה דבר יהוה אליו is rendered by LXX καί eWvs φωνή θ(0ΰ eyeveroeyevero irpos αυτόν \kywv. Philo's text differs only very slightly, cf. Ryle, 54. From euthus Philo infers that God hastens to forestall the questioner, anticipat ing his speaking. See Heres 66-67. Philo infers "constancy" from Rebekah. She is ύττομονή, Somn. I 46, or ίτημονήεπιμονή Fuga 45 and Cher. 41. As the daughter of Bethuel, she is the "daugh ter of her god," that is wisdom, QG IV, 97 to Gen. 24.15. See similarly Fuga 50-51. It is the "self-taught" Isaac with whom Philo associates "constancy," as in QG IV, 127-146, based on Gen. 24.50-67.</page><page sequence="143">[143] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 293 Abraham to a partnership in virtue and has made him both in fact and in name a Sage.325 Abraham differs from Enoch who was also a Sage. The earlier Sage did not abide among men, but, inspired with heaven-sent madness, went out into the wilderness.326 Abraham, however, follows a tame and gentle piety327 and accordingly practices both piety to God and friendliness to men.328 Abraham's constancy329 is the result of his virtue having been acquired by teaching, something different than the acquisition by practice which marked Jacob. Abraham has been endowed with a happy nature which, with the cooperation of memory,330 assures retentiveness; he has a tight grip and firm armhold on what he has learned and therefore he remains constant.331 The "Practicer," on the other hand, relaxes after a strenuous exer cise while he collects and recovers the force which has been en feebled by his exertions.332 It was God who improved Abraham's nature, while Jacob's was improved by the divine Logos.333 The 3*3 Mut. 71. 3*6 That Enoch "was not," Gen. 5.24, means that the Sage is usually not recognized among men and they shun his company. This might lend support, Philo suggests, for the notion held by some (cf. SVF III, 32) that there is no such thing as a sage, but Philo declines to enter into this question, simply asserting that there are in existence both wisdom and sages. He infers further from the "translation" of Enoch that Enoch left human society. 3*' In Heres, 127 Philo distinguishes between divine and human wisdom; the former is a lover of solitudes and the possession of the solitary God; the latter is gentle, tame, and sociable, and pleased to dwell with mortals. 3*8 Mut. 39-42, based on Gen. 17.1.

Compare last part of note 324. 33» On memory, see Philo's interpretation of the ten camels of Gen. 24 in note 269. 33■ Philo's contrast between Abraham and Jacob rests on the observation that though the name of each was changed, Jacob is still frequently called Jacob even after the alteration, while Abram does not recur once Abraham is mentioned. 33* Mut. 83-84. 333 Gen. 32.25, tells that a "man" wrestled with Jacob. Philo interprets the man first to be an angel and next to be the Logos, Mut. 87.</page><page sequence="144">294 SAMUEL SANDMEL [144] Logos can perfect the mind, but it cannot, as God can, produce a mind which is constant and unswerving.334 The perfection attained through teaching ultimately equals perfection by nature;335 this, Philo tells us, is the sense of "jour neying together, they came to the place of which God had spoken."336 Both Abraham and Isaac prove capable of carrying off virtue's prizes.337 Abraham, to summarize, is now perfected. He possesses not only the (four cardinal) specific virtues, but generic, ideal virtue itself.338 Abraham has attained to this intelligible virtue by strip ping himself, as it were, of the wordly bond imposed by the body and bodily requirements. Virtue now guides Abraham, not like a slave, but a perfect administrator.339 Abraham achieves the highest kind of joy and 334 Mut. 85-87. 33s See QG IV, 143: . . For when Abraham and Isaac are analyzed (they are) one and the same thing . . 336 Ryle, op. cit. p. 86, and Wendland, ad loc., cite the verse as Gen. 22.3. Colson and Whitaker cite it as 22.8. "They journeyed together" is indeed 22.8. The remainder of Philo's citation is 22.9, words which are quite similar to 22.3. God as place, both near and far, based on Gen. 22.3-4 is found in Sornn. I 63 ff. and Post. 17 f. Gen. 22.3 is treated a little differently in Mig. 139 f.: when the mind has passed the divisions of time and has quit them for timeless existence, then it "will sacrifice his only son, no human being (for the wise man is not a slayer of his offspring), but the male progeny of . . . the soul." 337337337 philo compares them with painting and sculpture, which, before per fection, create only inanimate copies of nature; but Abraham (and Isaac) now become embodiments of nature itself, Mig. 167. This notion seems to be related, though not directly, with the notion that the patriarchs were the embodiment of natural law (the nomos empsychos). What is lacking in the connection is an explicit mention of law. When it is recalled, however, that Philo insists that the lives of the patriarchs are legal matters and not simply biographical, then the connection seems to me to be beyond doubt; cf. Abr. 5. 333338 This possession comes late in a man's life, Gen. 15.17, Heres 307-308. Marcus conjectures, probably correctly, that QG III, 14 lacks the expected interpretation, Philo Supplement, I, 198, note c. Humility as the precursor to coming before God is derived from Gen. 18.27. See Heres 30, Quod Deus, 161, and QG IV, 28. On the sage's humility, in the light of "joy," see Mut. 154, based on Gen. 17.17; see also QG III, 41. 339 The basis is Gen. 18.10 in QG IV, 13. In MT, the hu 'aharav is vague. Tar. Jon. tells that "hu' was Ishmael, eavesdropping. Rashi follows older</page><page sequence="145">[145] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 295 gladness.340 This joy is a divine gift to him, stemming from his authorites in taking hu as "it," that is, the door was behind the angel. LXX renders the hu, Sarah "being" behind him (Abraham). 3&lt;0 See QG IV, 18-19 on Gen. 18.14-15. Philo also infers this from Gen. 15.18 in one allegory by a play on Ευφράτης and ίΰφροσύνη; Heres 316; cf. QG QG III, 16 and Somn. II, 255 ff. In another and frequently repeated allegory, Isaac represents the joy begotten by God out of Sarah, virtue, and given to Abraham. Further on Isaac as joy, God's offspring, cf. Mut. 130 f. based on Gen. 17.16; see also, passingly, QG III, 54. Gen. 21.6 is the principal source (though not the only one) for Philo's view of the allegorical Sarah as impregnated by God with the "joy," Isaac, to be presented to the Sage. The longest discussion of what Philo describes as a saying not for all to hear, so strongly does the evil of superstition flow, is Mut.Mut. 137-141. Philo cites the verse in LA III, 219, with the advice to initiates to open their ears wide and take in holy teachings; Philo here precedes his esoteric interpretation and the warning about it with a more literal, though still allegorical, statement of the Sage begetting out of virtue, based on Gen. 17.15-16. The esoteric here is buttressed by assuming that the kyrios (אדני) of Gen. 18.11-12 is the divine Logos, and the "old" means "great"; LA II, 82 is only a passing mention; Deter. 124 has the same notions expressed with less reservation: "God may, with perfect truth, be said to be Isaac's father." Philo in Cher. 45 ff. has no more than an allusion to the same verse in the midst of two other instances of portraying God as the impregnator (of Leah and Rebekkah); what he dwells on is the mystic nature of his interpretation and his injunction to the initiates not to babble about it. One despairs of adequately interpreting exactly what Philo means in his reference to seeing Jeremiah; possibly it is no more than an expression of Philo's delight at finding in Jeremiah's book a verse which lent itself to this esoteric twist. If the passage means more than that, the plus eludes me. The exposition of the allegory of the birth of Isaac utilizes the sexual imagery of the biblical passages. Other relevant Philonic passages are Abr. 99-102; Cher. 43-50; and QG IV, 14-18. The point that Philo makes in this elaborate exegesis can be summed up as follows: When a man possesses true virtue as Abraham did, God gives that man joy which God begets out of virtue. Generic virtue in turn begets out of the mind (and therefore in the man) specific virtues. Philo's utilization of the sexual imagery is what Good enough has in mind in speaking of the great Female Principle of nature, BLL, 2222 ff. Philo makes a good many verses accord to this sexual allegory with persistent single-mindedness. God visits Sarah, Gen. 21.1 —to procreate joy out of virtue, Cher. 45. Sarah has "ceased after the manner of women," Gen.Gen. 18.11 —the virtue which God will deal with is virginal, Cher. 50; LA, III, 217 (which explains similarly Gen. 17.16-17, and Gen. 21.6;) Del. 28; Post.Post. 134; Ebr. 59-62; Fuga. 128; and Somn. II, 185. Note also QG IV, 15. See QG III, 55-56. "My Lord is 'old' " (ibid.) is an allusion to God or the</page><page sequence="146">296 SAMUEL SANDMEL [146] virtue which has fathered it.341 True Sage that he is, Abraham is prepared, in his piety, to offer this joy to God.342 God, however, Logos and not to Abraham, Mut. 166 and LA III 217. Isaac as joy, or pure thought, is the product of a virgin (derived from Gen. 18.11), and is timeless, for Gen. 21.2 seems to allow no interval, and hence no time factor, between Sarah's conception and giving birth; see Fuga 167. The allegory can be found worked out in a good many ingenious and even far-fetched details in Mut. 130-174. 34" The interpretation of Gen. 21.7 in Mig. 140 bothers the commentators both as to Philo's sense and as to the syntax of the Greek; cf. Colson and Whitaker, IV, 563. The difficulty does not seem to me to be too great; rather, the high involvement of Philo's exegesis, in this case confounded by a paren thetical clause, occasions the problem. As I see it, Sarah does not know how she bore Isaac; he ("joy") is a divine growth; Gen. 21.7 expresses the idea of the soul's ignorance of having produced joy. At this point, hearkening back to Aristotle's doubt, namely, that perfection through being taught and through practice are discernible in the world, but perfection through nature not so, Philo tells us that Sarah, as though like Aristotle, assumed that Abraham did not believe in the appearance of a breed like Isaac; to reassure us that Isaac is indeed the example of this type, Philo points out that the verse does not occur in the passive ("a child is being suckled by Sarah"), but in the active, ("Sarah is suckling") that is, he is arguing that virtue produces joy actively. Next, as though fearing that the production of Isaac might compromise his natural perfection, he reverts to a restatement of the natural perfection: the autodidact is not nourished by anyone, but is the nourishment of others, being able to teach and not needing to learn. It seems unnecessary to me to follow Cohn, V, 189 and Colson and Whitaker in taking Paidion as the subject of Philo's sentence; there is nothing that I have encountered in Philo's writings which accords either literally or allegorically to it. Variation occurs in Philo's thought; the difficulty with the interpretations here argued against is that they imply matters as if Philo is directly reversing himself. 34־ Philo so interprets Gen. 22, Abr. 200-204 and LA III, 209; cf. Somn. I, 193_I95 and Quod Deus, 4. The paradox of "the place," reached in Gen. 22.3, but still three days distance in verse 4, seems crucial in the allegory. On God as "place," a common rabbinic title too, see Wolfson I, 247 ff. The "binding" itself, which gives the rabbinic name עקדה to the incident, is virtually ignored by Philo. A passage, Mig. 125-126, which is in itself obscure because of its brevity, alludes to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as the three divisions of eternity. Colson and Whitaker IV, 563 note the obscurity and offer in explanation, based on Mig.Mig. 154, which alludes to Gen. 22.3 "they came to the (P)lace on the third day, as entering upon the inheritance of virtue by a threefold light, memory of things gone by, clear sight of things present, and the expectation of things to come"; they point out, however, that on the surface the allegory of Abraham</page><page sequence="147">[147] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 297 rewards Abraham by returning joy to him, because Abraham travels the road of virtue.343 does not fit in here as well as would those of Isaac and Jacob. But It seems to me that a comparison of the contents of this passage with Mut. 267-269 can dis close Philo's intent. There Philo sets forth the proportion that eternity is to time, that is, eternity is to its divisions, as generic virtue is to perceptible virtues. As for the difficulty of aligning all this with Philo's allegorical quanti ties, perhaps Colson and Whitaker are expecting an undue measure of precision from Philo. See also Plant. 113-116, in which Philo discusses the fruits of instruction as the three-fold aspects of eternal virtue, but without reference there to the patriarchs. A note by Heinemann in the German translation, V, 193, denies that the three days of Mig. 154 is an allusion to Gen. 22.3; Heine mann suggests other Scriptural possibilities, probably on the basis that in context we deal in Mig. 154 with Israel going out of Egypt, not with Abraham; but none of his suggestions seem persuasive. It does not seem tc me that it does violence to Philo to attribute to him a mixing of his metaphors. Heine mann's citation of Rashi to Deut. 1.2 does not seem to me felicitous 343 Abr. 204. Philo takes Gen. 18.9, "where is Sarah, virtue," as a prelude to the answer, "it is in the soul" (the "tent"); QG IV, 11 and Deter. 57-60. Philo alludes once again to God's impregnating virtue with joy, thereafter born out of her to the Sage. , His all too frequent preoccupation with numbers leads Philo in Mut. 188 ff. to align Abraham with other worthies whose virtue-joy must harass and destroy injustice, all this under the aegis of a perfect number. This is to be discovered in Gen. 21.33, &gt;n the 'eshel which Abraham planted; Philo's text reads apovpav which Philo interprets "in the technical sense of a piece of land of 100 cubits square" (Colson and Whitaker, V, 239 note). There is in Philo no reflection of the wondrous rabbinic exegesis of 'eshel, such as its being an abbreviation for אכל שתיה לויה, Mid. Psalms no, and elsewhere. Philo discusses the same passage in Genesis in Plant. 73 ff. ; he has there the same data about the size; he tells us that the text does not tell us what Abraham planted but only the size of the plot of ground. Philo goes on to explain how the details of the rest of the verse, the well of the oath (Beer Sheba) and the invoking of the name of God fit into the passage. Briefly, the expression "planted" presupposes attention to the appropriate trees, that is, a spiritual tree, planted in the mind (Stavoia) of the one beloved of God; the 100 cubits square yields a total of 10,000 square cubits, and 10,000 is to 1 as the end of a race-course is to the beginning; hence the aroura is the symbol of proclaiming God as the beginning and final goal of all things! "Well-diggers" are those who search for spiritual water which nourishes the soul ; for some the search, whether for real or spiritual water, is unsuccessful. This particular well is known from Gen. 26.32 f., to have yielded no water; it is impossible to attain perfection in any of the sciences; it is appropriate to call such a well "the oath" because when God is called in on disputed points, there is nothing on which a surer</page><page sequence="148">298 SAMUEL SANDMEL [148] A second result of Abraham's virtue is his steadfast appre hension of the wisdom of God.344 Vice leads the thoughts down wards, but virtue leads upwards.345 Because his thoughts lead upwards, Abraham experiences the highest form of ecstasis, prophecy.346 He is inspired and God-possessed, a prophet, and a friend of God.347 Abraham, as a prophet and friend of God, passes oath can be taken that no perfection is reached in studying the sciences; the true power of apprehensions springs from the seeds of certitude sown on the organs of perception by God. The fruit of the aroura is "the name of the Lord, as God eternal; Lord is the ruling power, God the beneficial power" —as so frequently in Philo, especially in connection with Gen. 18. In contrast with Abraham, the laughter of Lot's sons-in-law (QG IV, 43 to Gen. 19.14) is the short-lived joy achieved through the body, rather than virtue. 344 Heres 313-315. 34s Heres 241. In QG IV, 93 to Gen. 24.10 Philo allegorizes Nahor as "rest of light." His intent is quite elusive. He seems to be saying that Nahor — rest and quiet — is not profitable, but that wisdom must move the sage towards things suitable and related. Marcus I, 376, note i, hazards a guess, a com mendable effort to solve an obscure and possibly corrupt passage; but I do not agree that Philo means that "the wise man seeks the quiet of light." 346 Philo derives the notion from Ικστασις of LXX Gen. 15.12, for which MTMT reads tardema; the exegesis is possible only on the LXX. See QG III, 9. Philo lists four kinds of ecstasis·, delusion, consternation, passivity, and prophecy; Heres 249-258. He adds that the notion is not only derivable from his verse, but explicitly stated, Gen. 20.7, which terms Abraham a prophet; Heres Heres 258 and, passingly QG IV, 66; cf. also QG IV, 90, based on Gen. 24.7. 347 Ecstasis, Philo tells us, is the regular inheritance of the race of prophets beloved of God; it consists in the "setting" (Gen. 15.12, in which the sun becomes allegorically human reason) of the human mind and the entrance of divine reason. The prophet himself does not speak (as proved by the passive, "it was said to Abraham," Gen. 15.13), but God speaks through the prophet; Heres Heres 263-266. The "race of prophets" constitutes, as it were, a synhedrion of God's friends, whom God addresses by name, as he did Abraham, Gen. 22.1-2, 9-12; Somn. I, 193-195. The man who is not a sage perceives God through his senses, and to him God is "master and benefactor"; but God is not a master, but rather a friend to the Sage, as proved by "shall I hide anything from Abraham, my friend," Gen. 18.17; on this verse, see above, II, note 130. The passage is Sob. 55-57; see also QG IV, 21. That Abraham is God's friend is proved by the familiar language which God uses, "by Myself have I sworn," Gen. 22.16, Abr. 273; this oath brought with it an abundance of good things to the perfect Abraham, LA III, 203. Philo summarizes briefly the treatment of ecstasis based on Gen. 15 in</page><page sequence="149">[149] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 299 beyond the bounds of human happiness. He becomes nobly born, registering God as his father and becoming by adoption His only son; he is the possessor not merely of riches, but even of all riches, of the good things which do not grow old but continually renew their youth; he has not only a good reputation, but he is truly good, since his praise is not the flattery of men but praise ratified by truth. He is the sole king,348 having received from God LA LA III 40 ff.; he quotes Gen. 24.7 as another Scriptural basis for his contention that only he whom God rescues out of the prison of the body can attain to being with God. In Heres 258-263 Philo quotes Gen. 20.7, in which Abraham is expressly called a prophet. That is to say, Philo buttresses his exegesis with a clinching proof-text. His continuation, however, is significant: "The Holy Word assures prophecy to every worthy man" (panti asteio). Not only is there in Philo no hint of the rabbinic view that prophecy ceased at the time of Ezra, but to the contrary, it is a continuing possession of the human race. See Frank Young in JBL, LXVIII (1949), p. 297. Wolfson II, 52, engages in some mental gymnastics at the termination of which he concludes that Philo's view of continuing prophecy is akin to the rabbinic bat kol, and that Philo presumably also believed that the older Scripture-creating prophecy had ceased. Wolfson is hardly to be followed here, Marginal Jewries, if one can judge by the continuing apocalyptic tendencies and their literary expressions, did not share the rabbinic view of the cessation of prophecy. Prophecy is assumed to be extant in Paul's letters, especially Galatians frequently, and in I Corinthians XII, 10 and XIII, 2. See also Ephesians, IV, 11. See Didache XI-XIII, wherein the distinction between apostle and prophet becomes blurred; presumably the prophet is an apostle but not every apostle is a prophet. The dates of the Apocalypse of Abraham and the Testament of Abraham are uncertain; see JE I, 674; they get their points of departure from the same Scriptural section, Gen. 15. Wolfson's horizons here seem quite limited. 548 Philo has several passages in which he alludes to Abraham as king: Mut.Mut. 152, Abr. 261; Virt. 216 (cf. ibid. 207 for his pleasureless mating). The most striking passage is Somn. II 244, where Philo declares that those who recognized Abraham as king "laid down the doctrine for students of philosophy that the Sage alone is a ruler and king, and virtue a rule and a kingship whose authority is final." Sob. 57 does not directly make this same identification; it is there only allusively, and ensues on Philo's interpretation of Gen. 18.17, which we have noted supplied Philo with "friend" rather than LXX "servant"; cf. note 347 and LA III 27 and QG IV, 21. See, too, QG IV, 121. In the present passage, Philo goes on to say that one who has such a portion (that is, of being God's friend) has registered (knyeypapevos) God as his father and become</page><page sequence="150">300 SAMUEL SANDMEL [150] the sceptre of universal sovereignty which none can dispute. He is the sole freeman, for God has released him from the tyranny of vain opinion.349 As a prophet, Abraham enjoys the vision of God. This occurs when Abraham has dispelled the bodily mist and comes into the clear atmosphere of the higher verities.350 When a soul comes into God's presence, He does not turn away, but in His love of mankind comes forward to meet the soul and, in the measure that the beholder is capable of seeing, reveals His nature. A man cannot by himself apprehend the Truly Existent, but he requires His revelation and mani festation.351 The sight of To On is the ultimate. Philo insists that Abraham receives this best possible vision, as we shall see below. Before that, however, he "still stood near" (Gen. 18.22) to the Power of God.352 He does not, like Cain, hide himself from God, but both sees and is seen.353 While he rises from time to time to the supreme heights, he abides between these ascents among the by adoption his only {μόνο%) son. The language here brings to mind Romans VIII, 14-15 and Eph. I, 5. See also Conf. 145 ff. for Philo's discussion of Deut. 14.1 and related expressions equal to "sons of God"; Deut. 14.1 is also discussed, in the same way, in Spec. I, 318. In Philo's writings expressions such as, son of God, friend of God, family of God, and prophet are nearly interchangeable. 33י Sob. 55-57. For the Sage as a freeman, see Colson IX, 2-3, part of the introduction to Probus, which is, of course, Philo's lengthy exposition of the doctrine. Cf. Probus 42, where Philo tells us that the "friends" of God are free. Cf. also Probus 158-160: freedom is not a question of citizen or slave but of the capacity of the soul to rise above bodily hindrances, and to live agreeably to nature. 350 In another passage Philo makes the oak of Gen. 18.1, equivalent to Sophia. Abraham sees the vision of God as incorporeal rays of light while seated under the oak; QG IV, 1. The prediction of Gen. 24.7 shows also that Abraham was a prophet, QG IV, 90. That the vision of God results after freedom from the bondage of the body is treated laconically by Philo through citing Gen. 12.1 and 7 in juxtaposition, in Deter. 159-60. 351 Abr. 77-80. The use of the passive, "God was seen by Abraham," LXX Gen. 12.7, ώφθη proves that God must reveal himself for man to be able to see him. ב5נ Cher. 18-19, Post. 27, QG IV, 25. 333 LA III, 6, Somn.

It is not the eyes of his body which receive this vision. Bodily eyes require light as a means of seeing, while the soul sees by its own agency without any intermediary light. Just as conceptions become intelligibly visible without light, or put forth their own light, so God puts forth pure rays intensely bright and free from shadow which are discernible to the soul.356 Initially, before he had become perfect, Abraham had not actually seen God. He had seen one of the Powers, the Royal Power.357 While Abraham is progressing, his God is spoken of as Theos, the Creative or Beneficial Power, because Theos is the maker of the virtuous soul, the soul stripped of the body.358 354 Somn. I, 70. God's going up from Abraham, Gen. 17.22, is not the separation of God from the sage, but rather an opportunity now for the pupil to exhibit his own powers, Mut. 270. 355 Gen. 18.16 is the basis. The verse reads "Abraham travelled with them, joining with them in escorting them on their way." Philo adds: "What a glorious privilege to be put on a level with them! The escort is escorted: he gives what he was receiving . . . For as long as he falls short of perfection he has the Divine Logos as his leader," Mig. 173. See also QG IV, 20. 356 Mut. 3-6. On this "light-stream" and its probable Persian antecedents, see Goodenough, 12-14. Philo tells us again in this passage, Mut. 7-15, that To To On is never apprehended by man, since there is neither an organ in sense to envisage him nor in mind to conceive Him, and even Moses fails in this quest to know God. It is sufficient for mortals to know the things, material and immaterial, below God. Because God appears to have a name does not mean that God is known. In truth, God has no name, but men need a substitute for it in order to be able to address their prayers. Even His Powers (the wrestler with Jacob Gen. 32.29) cannot reveal God's name. 357 Mv.t. 7-15. Kyrios and Theos are the Powers of God. Kyrios is the ruling Power; Theos is the creative Power. Neither of these is actually God, except in a loose way of speaking; they are only the senior Powers of To On Abr.Abr. 120--121. See QG III, 39 and Mut. 28-30. That it is Kyrios who appears in the first part of Gen. 17.1 is explicable by the fact that, as Abram, our protagonist requires a master, the Royal Power; while the Theos of the second part of the verse indicates that Abraham is on his way to betterment, and therefore he is associated with Theos. The exegesis, depending on LXX Gen. 17.1, 17.1, would not be possible on MT, which reads Yahweh in the first of the verse, but El Shaddai in the second part. 338 Mut. 27-34.</page><page sequence="152">302 SAMUEL SANDMEL [152] God appears to men in either a triple vision, if the mind is only partly purified,359 or in a single vision if the mind is com pletely purified.360 This can be stated, Philo tells us, in still an other way. There are three classes of temperaments which get the divine vision in different ways. The lowest class sees the Power on the left, kvplos, the ruling Power. The intermediate class sees the Power on the right, deos, the beneficial Power. The best class sees the form in the middle, To On. Tempera ments of the best361 kind worship only To On, and nothing can make them swerve from this.362 Another proof that Abraham saw God is to be inferred from the zeal and speed with which he bade virtue (Sarah) to knead three measures of meal and make "buried cakes."363 God has 355 QG IV, 5, based on the reversion from singular to plural in Gen. 18.4; and QG IV, 6 to Gen. 18.5, in which the comment stems from the unexpected "I will take," rather than "take you." Philo infers from the use of the singular in the Decalogue that they are addressed to each single person; when he is law-abiding and obedient to God, he is equal to a nation, or nations, or indeed the whole world. This, too, says Philo, is the intent of LXX Gen. 17.1, in which God says, "I am thy God," even though He is the God of the whole world. See Decal. 37-38. To the right eous, He is a beneficial deity; to the unrighteous, He is a stringent master; see Mut. 18 ff.: "His will is to be called the Lord and Master (Kvpios Kal Aenxôr^s) of the bad, the God (0éos) of those on their way to betterment, but of the best and most perfect at once God (Theos) and the Lord (Kyrios)." 360 Abr. 122; QG IV, 2, based on Gen. 18.2. 361 It is undoubtedly a t5'pographical error which produces a contextually impossible rendering of apiaros as "last" in place of "best" in Colson's translation, Abr. 125. 362 Abr. 125. See also QG III, 41 to Gen. 17.3 and QG IV, 4 to Gen. 18.3. The LXX of Gen. 15.2, in which אדני אלהים is rendered by Akcwora nvpie, leads Philo into an explanation of StairoT-qs and its supposed Greek etymol ogy, utimately from the root meaning "fear," by way of the word for "bond." See Heres 23 ff. Wolfson does not list A6cr7rôr7js in his section in which he enumerates other titles used by Philo or suggested by LXX, I, 39-40; Wolfson does not discuss the present passage. It also fails to appear in the list which Drummond, II, 63 acknowledges to be incomplete, but he cites the passage in II, 85-86. On God as the bond, a frequent item in Philo, see Bréhier, 85, who properly notes that more usually, as in Plant. 8 ff. (incorrectly cited in Bréhier as Plant. 10) it is the Logos which is actually the "bond." 363 Gen. 18.6. The LXX adds kytcpviplas for which MT provides no basis. The word is crucial to the allegory.

God called up before the eye three separate visions or aspects. Each of these aspects is the measure of all things, the rulership of its subjects, the goodness of all good things; and God Himself is the measure of all things corporeal and incorporeal. The Powers serve God by assuming the functions of rules and standards, and measure what lies in their province. While God who overtops his Powers is visible apart from them, it is well that the three (measures) be kneaded and blended in the soul, so that the soul can receive the im pression of God's sovereignty and beneficence.364 That Abraham is a temperament of the best kind and that he saw the triple vision as a single object is clear, Philo tells us, not merely from allegory, but from the use of the singular in the literal text.365 As a prophet, Abraham seems to be speaking when to Gen. 19.3; the sage knows things hidden from the multitude; Lot, not a sage, offers other food, i. e., the things the multitude knows. 364 Sac. 59-60. Philo terms this a teaching of the higher mystery, like a similar teaching in the lower mystery, the baking of Matzoth, Ex. 12.39. The lower incident represents the kneading of passion with reason; this higher incident represents a vision of God. The "buried" aspect means that this higher mystery must not be blabbed or babbled about by those admitted to it; Sac.Sac. 60-62. On the greater and lower mysteries, cf. Goodenough, 95-96, and Wolfson I, 47-48; while these commentators seem opposed to each other on the significance of the mysteries, they agree that the lower mysteries are the level of perception and the higher, the level of the intelligible. 365 Abr. 131-132. As explained above, page 241, Gen. 18 varies from the singular to the plural and back, giving Philo (and later Christian trinitarians) a point of departure for equating God with a tri-partite form. Philo infers a number of different conclusions from the association of a particular divine name with one or more of the patriarchs, and his inferences do not always agree with each other. We saw above that Philo declared that Abraham ulti mately equalled Isaac in perfection. Elsewhere Philo comments on Gen. 28.13, "I am the Lord God (kyrios theos) of Abraham thy father and the God (theos) of Isaac." Philo first explains that Jacob, having attained virtue through practice inherited God under both titles. Abraham needs two tending powers so that he might be directed and graciously benefitted; Isaac needed only the gracious benefaction and not the direction since he was born perfect and needed no improvement. Jacob, as their offspring, inherited both kyrios and theos•, Abraham is spoken of as his father, instead of grandfather, because practice stems from instruction; and Jacob can be spoken of as the son of Isaac, Gen. 46.1, only when he becomes Israel, the seer of God; Somn.

The created being is not able to contain God forever but only from time to time, and then must return to itself.367 Abraham abides in the state from which the ascent to the divine vision can take place. He remains immutably in wisdom,368 recognition of the virtues of the patriarchs, God, insofar as He has a name, is associated in that name with the patriarchs as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, an eternal name, Ex. 3.15; Abr. 50-51. It would seem that on the one hand Philo can regard the biblical word used for God as only a Power of To On, or, if it suits his purpose, as To On Himself. 366 Heres 266 ff. and QG III, 10, Philo's biblical basis is the passive eppefbj of LXX Gen. 15.13, for which MT reads the active wa-yomer 10. The exegesis can rest only on the LXX. The inference accords with Philo's notion of ecstasis.ecstasis. The mind, having been led out of itself, is no longer the agent directing speech. It has been led out of the prison-house of the body; it is therefore ministering to God; it is not a human mind but now a divine one; Heres 84-85. Elsewhere Philo describes the process as akin to persons possessed and cory bants (κατίχόμίνοι καί κορνβανηωντκ) who are filled with inspired frenzy (βακχΐυθύσα(βακχΐυθύσα καί θίορηθίΐσα), or, like the mind under divine afflatus (ΐνθου σιωση$)σιωση$) and no longer in its own keeping, but stirred to its depths and mad dened by heavenward yearning, drawn by To On and pulled upward to Him; Heres Heres 68-70. Another Philonic term is "sober intoxication," a phrase which Philo apparently invented (cf. Lewy, Sobria Ebrietas), as a description of the union of the purely spiritual side of man with the divine. The phrase is to be found in connection with Samuel in Ebr. 143 ff.; in connection with Abraham, Philo asserts that the wine brought forth by Melchizedek brought on the sober intoxication, LA III, 77 ff. Brehier believes that the conception of prophecy is Greek and Egyptian (p. 185); Wolfson, on the other hand, be lieves that Philo's views on prophecy are derivable and derived from Scripture, and then adjusted to Platonic terminology regarding frenzy (II, 10 ff.). I incline to the view of Brehier. It seems to me that Philo's process is to begin with a hellenistic view and then to justify it on a biblical basis; Wolfson's view would suppose that Philo began with a series of biblical views of prophecy and fortuitously found a Platonic equivalent. 367 QG IV, 29. The basis is Gen. 18.33, "The Lord departed when he ceased speaking with Abraham and Abraham returned to his place." In another passage, Philo uses this verse somewhat differently: God Himself has withdrawn and Abraham is now meeting with His "place," divine Logov, Somn.Somn.

This is the best and most beautiful of all good states, the one by which the soul is filled entirely with contentment.374 The joy is not confined within time, in the sense of intervals perceived by sense and sight, but in eternity, the intelligible archetype of time.375 The gift of this joy376 marks the end of the process of the perfection of Abraham. Before, as Abram, he had been devoid of י6ג QG IV, 68. Abraham's dwelling in the "south," QG IV, 59, is inter preted as his abiding in virtues. See also QG IV, 60. 370 pUga 209. 37' Mut. 202. 37J Mut. 202, 218. In interpreting Gen. 15.5, Philo notes that the text does not say "so many" will be your seed, but only "so"; God suggests not merely number, but a multitude of other things which make happiness complete. Ultimately, that seed will be like the visible ether (on which see Heres 283), the very likeness of the stars. The Sage is a counterpart of heaven, or rather a heaven on earth, possessing here the qualities of "ether." Colson and Whitaker do not render the Greek of Heres 87 as happily as does Joseph Cohn in the German; indeed, the passage, which is not too difficult in Greek, is in the English involved and obscure. The verse is interpreted correspondingly, but yet differently in LA III 39 ff.: as elsewhere Philo focuses here on the pleonastic hexo, inferring the ecstasis that goes far beyond mere stand-out from sense-perception. 373 Philo does not directly equate "Isaac" with the sight of God. I do not believe, however, that I have gone beyond his intent in making this equation. The natural step in Philo's gradation would be from hearing God to seeing God; Scripture does not provide Philo such a natural step and he must there fore proceed from hearing to joy, rather than to seeing. 374 Praem. 31-35.

The words of Gen. 17.22, "When God completed talking with him, he went up from Abraham" do not mean that Abraham is parted from God; they only show that the learner arrives at the stage at which he becomes independent of the teacher, and, as one com pletely taught, he is ready, in his perfect state, to proceed on his own powers.377 Abraham's body, of course, dies.378 His mind, however, puri fied of both body and of the material irrational soul is incor ruptible.379 Abraham has been promised such incorruptibility of his immaterial soul long before his death: Abraham would go to his fathers, nourished in peace, in a goodly old age.380 The fathers, Philo tells us, can be interpreted variously. One view identifies fathers with the sun, moon, and stars. Another view interprets fathers as the world of ideas in which the mind of the Sage, after the death of the body, makes its new home. A third view identifies fathers with the four elements of the material world, earth, air, water, and fire, and with the fifth element, of the immaterial world, ether; by this latter view, the human soul is a fragment of the fifth essence.381a 377דלג Mut. 270. 378 QG IV, 152: "Death is the most glorious life of the . . . soul." 3יל Quod Deus, 45-46; QG IV, 152-153; Sac. 5. 380 Gen. 15.15, where LXX reads Tpatpeis, "nourished" for תקבר, equiv alent to ra&lt;peis. See QG III, 11. The exegesis ignores the Hebrew. In connection with this verse Philo quotes Gen. 12.1-2 to demonstrate that the soul having once departed from the "father's house," would scarcely be returning to it; hence "thy fathers" must mean something else, Heres 277. 381a381a Heres, 280 ff. See note 380. The literal fathers of the verse would be the ancestors buried in Chaldea; Philo sneers at this notion in the passage. Wolfson I, 400, would have it that Philo actually denies the soul's return to the fifth essence: Philo "could not accept the view that souls become stars for to him the stars are made of the element fire, whereas the immortal souls are immaterial. For the same reason he could not accept the view that the souls are resolved into the primary fire or ether." However, Philo has insisted that the fifth essence differs from the other four in its superior quality; it is, according to Philo, the purest of substances; Heres, 283. In Philo's view, ether, the fifth substance, is immaterial; that stars and the whole heavens are made of this substance would mean that these were immaterial to Philo, and not, as Wolfson suggests, the material, primary fire; the stars, Philo tells us, are</page><page sequence="157">[157] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 307 V We saw that the literal Abraham was an exposition of the events of the physical life of Abraham, arranged as to depict his piety towards God, and his possession of the cardinal virtues. We saw that the allegorical Abraham was a record of the spiritual side of Abraham, of his false start in pantheistic materialism, of his retracing his steps and through learning becoming a Sage, a king, and a prophet. It is necessary to point out what the differ ences between the two conceptions amount to, and what the similarities are. These similarities and differences can be seen most clearly against the total background of Philo's thought. Philo's message is essentially a very simple one: man represents a mixture of the material and the immaterial. Man can separate himself from the material only at death. But even while alive man can rise above his material aspect, can live by immaterial reality, can unite himself from time to time with God, and ulti mately, at death, rejoin the immaterial world which he left when his soul entered a physical body.

Wolfson may be influenced here by Drummond's effort, I, 273, to deny Soulier's affirmation that Philo believed in the fifth substance. After disparaging Soulier's method of assembling passages to prove the point, Drummond proceeds himself to assemble passages in the same way. The question of whether or not ether was material may be left for another occasion; for our purposes, in the passage under consideration, Philo gives no evidence of rejecting the view that the soul returns to the fifth essence. That Philo is vague on the destiny of the soul after the death of the body is recognized by Goodenough ("Philo on Immortality," Harvard Theological Review, XXXIX, April, 1946, 101) : "Clearly the soul or higher mind returns at its death to its source . . . But it is impossible to say whether for Philo that meant what we call 'personal immortality' or was a spiritual absorption into the Source by which the individual spirit became an anonymous part of the universal spirit." Philo is vague, again, on the question of whether the patriarchs abide in heaven after death as, in Christian doctrine, Christ does. Philo speaks of three para cletes, connected with the patriarchs but not identical with them; these are, first, God's clemency, third, the reformations worked by virtuous men, and second, "the holiness of the founders of the race," Praem. 166; cf. Spec. IV, 181. Philo, following views derivable from the Bible, seems clearly to assert that the merits of the patriarchs abide, but he does not go as far as suggesting that the patriarchs themselves abide as separate entities.</page><page sequence="158">308 SAMUEL SANDMEL [158] Philo urges is that man should act by his ability to rise above his material nature, that he should walk on the king's highway which leads to God. The historical Abraham is an example of a man who does just that. This Philo proves primarily from episodes in the life of Abraham. Episodic treatment lends itself to topical divisions. Thus, De Abrahamo moves from "piety" to the four cardinal virtues. The allegorical Abraham is not presented in incidents or episodes, but in minute details, based on a painstaking appraisal of a verse, clause, phrase, word, or even a part of a word, of the biblical text.381b Often a sequence of details adds up to a topic. The literal Abraham disclosed his piety in obeying the divine oracle to migrate from Chaldea. The piety of the allegorical Abraham is revealed by interpreting the words of Gen. 12.1, as departure from body, sense-perception, and speech. That Abra ham conquered the kings and rescued Lot proves his literal courage; allegorically, the incident proves that he conquered his warring senses and passions by the use of reason. The literal Abraham and the allegorical differ primarily in literary form, and not in substance. The two Abrahams of Philo are congruent with each other. Philo's separation of the two Abrahams is no more than his literary device. It enables him to choose whether to present a summary topic or, instead, exegetical details. The almost universal agreement among scholars that De Abrahamo,Abrahamo, the primary source for the literal Abraham, was written for Gentiles must not lead incorrectly to a notion that Philo has in the interest of apologetics given a distorted view of his Abraham to the outside world. Whether Gentiles or Jews were intended as the audience, it must be insisted that apologetic nuances do not affect Philo's conception of his Abraham one whit. The Abraham of the Exposition is exactly the same as the Abraham of the Allegory. This identity may possibly be concealed, at least on super ficial notice, by reason of the fact that the Abraham of De 381b This is true as a generalization even though Philo cites individual verses in De Abrahamo.</page><page sequence="159">[159] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 309 AbrahamoAbrahamo is regarded virtually throughout the treatise as the perfected Abraham, whereas in the scattered verses of the Allegory'we are confronted with an Abraham usually on the way towards perfection and only occasionally perfected. In only ##68-84 °f De Abrahamo does Philo allude to the process of Abraham's perfection; he is concerned almost exclusively with the end result. In the Allegory, however, the preoccupation with single verses or parts of verse leads Philo into detailed expositions of the process. The topical arrangement of De Abrahamo permits Philo to summarize in briefest forms matters which he discusses in the Allegory Allegory at great length. For example, he discusses Abraham's kingship most briefly;382 and he fails to make specific mention of Abraham as a prophet (although this notion lies behind Abra ham as a friend of God in Abr. 273). In the Allegory, however, these matters are dealt with in considerable detail. The detail is present for apparently two reasons: first, the consideration of scriptural texts in all their peculiarities seems to obligate Philo to enumerate all the matters to be inferred; and secondly, Philo is interested in "proving" that all of tenable Greek philosophy is implicit or explicit in the Bible. While in De Abrahamo he is able to content himself with the brief statement that Abraham migrated from Chaldean astrology, in the Allegory Philo considers in elaborate detail the significance of every single scriptural word describing the call to migration and Abraham's obedience, always deriving philosophical explanations from the fortuitous wording of Scripture. But the Allegory too is in a sense topical, in that each treatise is on some subject. In that pursuit Philo very often finds a con textual reason for citing from the Abraham part of Genesis as a device for buttressing an argument begun in some other connec tion but strenghtened by citation and explanation. For example, Philo begins Cherubim by considering what banishment is; he promptly recalls the incident of Hagar, so that Cherubim 3-10 is occupied with Philo's explanation of Hagar's flight and banish ment. The result of the sporadic citation is to furnish the collator ב!נ Abr. 261.</page><page sequence="160">310 SAMUEL SANDMEL [160] with an abundance of Abrahamic passages which give much more elaborate detail than the topical arrangement of De Abra hamohamo could possibly afford. Moreover, context can prompt Philo to emphasize at one point a facet of the exegesis of a verse which elsewhere is scrutinized for some different facet. That is to say, the laconic, topical treatment in De Abrahamo has behind it the richness of the multi-faceted material of the Allegory.Allegory. What is stated for once, and without adornment, in De De Abrahamo, is often repetitiously and complexly to be en countered in the Allegory. Accordingly, Philo omits from De Abrahamo Abrahamo all mention of his allegory of Hagar, but there can be no doubt that his allegorical understanding of her is implicit. Hagar appears, though namelessly. Philo, indeed, has no need there to allegorize Hagar. Dealing with the end result, Abraham, the perfected sage, Philo need not specify that Abraham mastered the encyclia. The topical arrangement, again, leads Philo to discuss general characteristics with a polished rhetoric and marked completeness: for example, he writes at some length on faith, in Abr. 268-273. The proof-text, Gen. 15.6, is cited by Philo in no less than seven other places;383 but only in the topical arrangement does Philo follow the topic rather than the biblical verses. The difference, then, between the literal Abraham and the allegorical is one of method and not content. The literary form of De Abrahamo has led Philo to follow an arrangement which differs only in form from the congruent conceptions expressed in other forms in the Allegory. Two conclusions follow. First, the commentator who makes inferences from De Abrahamo alone, without searching out Philo's fuller view, can inadvertently distort Philo's intent. Second, the apologetic cast of De Abrahamo is limited to literary form. The Abraham there is not conceived or moulded apologetically, but is in all verity Philo's genuine conception of Abraham. To put it in another way, while Philo may in De Abrahamo be presenting Abraham to Gentiles, he is not altering his essential view of Abraham one whit. 383 Mig. 44; LA III, 228; Quod. Deus, 4; Heres, 94-95; Mut., 177 and 186; and Virt., 216.</page><page sequence="161">[161] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 311 The early Graeco-Jewish writers, including Josephus, out of an apologetic motive, depicted Abraham as a philosopher and mathematician, whose achievements were a benefit of a universal character. The Abraham of IV Maccabees was portrayed as a model who through pious reason overcame his passions, and lived by the four Greek cardinal virtues. The Abraham of Philo is the mystic philosopher, a resident of some city like Alexandria. He has a thorough grounding in the lower learning and in philosophy. Through reason he conquers his bodily passions and rises above his senses. His life demon strates that he lived by the four cardinal virtues, which are the by-product of his piety.384 Indeed, Abraham penetrates beyond the specific virtues to generic virtue itself. He lives in the realm of the intelligible world; accordingly, he abandons city life from time to time for sojourns in the wilderness. There by contempla tion he rises to the best possible vision of God. Abraham is thus a perfected man, despite a false start in pantheism. He lives by the law of nature, and he is himself a law made vocal and in carnate. His contemporaries and his descendants benefit from his achievements. These three views just described represent three different measures of hellenization. The first is little more than surface. The second exhibits a partial concession to Greek norms. The third shows the process carried through to the greatest possible degree consistent with Jewish loyalty. Abraham is only part of Philo's hellenization of Judaism. While Philo defends the Law, the truly religious man is, to him, no longer only an observer of the Law, but, in conformity with hellenistic notions of salvation, such a man must rise above cor poreity, to use Wendland's phrase, into communion with incor poreal and immaterial reality. Like IV Maccabees Philo regards the Law as divine; but unlike IV Maccabees, which does not in reality discuss the question, Philo believes that there is a higher law of which the Law is only a copy. The Law leads to the higher reality, but is not identical with it. 384 IV Maccabees and Philo accord in some measure regarding piety, on the one hand, and the four virtues, on the other hand, as the ability to control the passions, and as characteristics of Abraham.</page><page sequence="162">312 SAMUEL SANDMEL [162] Both for Philo and for the rabbis Abraham is the first true believer. The rabbis infer from this biblical datum that Abraham observed piously all the details of the particular laws; Jubilees portrayed Abraham as an observer of the Law of Moses, and the rabbis add that he observed also the Oral Law. They accord ingly bring Abraham into relationship with details and minutiae of the two Laws. To Philo the observance of the Law is a lower aspect of religiosity; we may conjecture that he would have denied in dignantly the notion that Abraham was preoccupied with only the copy of the law of nature. Philo has so metamorphosed Judaism that no matter how much he wants to exalt the Law, he can raise it only to conformity with the law of nature and never to identity with it.385 Philo's approach to the Law, in such treatises as De Decalogo and De Specialibus Legibus is that of a defender rather than that of an exhorter; his exhortations are reserved for the higher law. A particular of the Law is never considered by Philo as an end in itself, but an illustration of an underlying principle. Bréhier386 points up this Philonic view of underlying principles in noting that Philo divides the Decalogue into two groups of five laws, the first five centering on piety towards God and the second set centering on justice, a division similar to what we have noted in De Abrahamo.38' It does not overstate the case too much to draw the contrast that Philo is somewhat passive in defending the Mosaic Law, but active and aggressive in exhorting his hearers to the higher law. Philo's view that the written Law is secondary accounts for his linking Abraham with the higher law. It is the conviction that there is nothing higher than the Law which impels the Jubilees and rabbis to make a halakic observer of the patriarch in advance of the Law. Abraham is to the rabbis and to Philo (as well as to Paul) the foremost example of the man who did what each is urging; but each is urging a different thing. 385 I give a fuller comparison of Philo and the rabbis below, page 320 ff. 388 Op. cit. 30. 38י Cf. Decal. 50-51 for Philo's division of the Law into the two sets of five.</page><page sequence="163">[163] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 313 The rabbis were interested in an abundant depiction of Abra ham observing specific laws. In the case of Philo, however, the concreteness is inevitably lacking in that the laws of nature, being ideal, are not specific. Philo gives us not one single example of Abraham's observing some specific biblical or halakic item. Philo rather asserts that Abraham practiced piety towards God and the cardinal virtues toward his fellow men. There is a lack of concreteness in such matters which may well have raised for Philo and for his audience a question of this sort: It is very well to urge men to live by Immaterial Reality, or by these metaphysical abstractions; but is it truly feasible? That such questions were raised is explicit in the treatise MutatioMutatio 36-37: "Indeed are there not still among the disciples of philosophy some who say that a wise man is non-existent and therefore wisdom also? None, they say, from the beginning of man's creation up to the life of today has been held to be com pletely free from fault, for absolute happiness is impossible to one imprisoned in the mortal body. Whether these statements are true we will inquire at the proper occasion. At present we will accept the text and say that wisdom is indeed something which exists, and so too is the lover of wisdom, the Sage, but, though he exists, we who are evil fail to see him, for good cannot keep company with bad." Philo, then, is concerned to demonstrate that it is feasible for a man to be a sage, that is, to rise above the body and to live by metaphysical principles. He gives demonstrations both from the present, and from the past, of his affirmative conviction. Thus he "proves" his point by describing two sects of his own time, the Essenes and the Therapeutae. Discussing the true free man, Philo tells us, in Probus, that there are people who judge only from appearance, who ask "who have there been in the past, and who are there living now of the kind that you imagine? An excellent answer is that in the past there have been those who surpassed their contemporaries in virtue, who took God for their sole guide and lived according to nature's right reason .... Also in our own time there are still men formed as it were in the like ness of the original high excellence of the sages." The exemplars from his own day do not appear herded in throngs, Philo tells us,</page><page sequence="164">314 SAMUEL SANDMEL [164] because they avoid the crowd. They pray that they may work a reformation in the lives of others; this is impossible in the cities, and therefore these exemplars go out into the lonelinessess.388 The Essenes are, according to Philo, a group which, in accord ance with the meaning of the name, holiness, sanctify God not by offering sacrifices but by resolving to sanctify their minds.389 They live in villages and avoid the city dwellers, this in order to escape the contamination inherent in cities. They pursue simple trades and crafts and cooperate with each other. They do not try to acquire more physical wealth than is required for the necessities of life; they stand alone among men in having become moneyless and landless deliberately. Peace lovers, there are no manufacturers of weapons of any kind among them. They reject the institution of slavery, and denounce slave owners for doing violence to the law of equality and annulling, impiously, the law of Nature. They leave the study of logic to quibblers and sophists, and the study of the physical world to babblers, while they themselves retain that part of philosophy which treats of the existence of God and the creation of the universe. This ethical part they study industriously, taking as their trainers the laws of their fathers which could not have been con ceived by the human soul without divine inspiration.390 Philo adds several more details391 which need not here concern us, since the outline above indicates adequately how Philo regards them: they are the example of his own way of living by the Higher Reality.392 The similarités of the Essenes and of the career of the patri archs are not set forth by Philo, beyond his laconic statement that 88נ Probus, 62-63. י8ג Bréhier points out (p. 52) that in his description of the Essenes Philo is being an apologist and not an historian. I should not hesitate to express the judgment that much if not most of what Philo has to say about both the Essenes and also the Therapeutae is fanciful, and congruent rather with Philo's Tendenz than with facts. Probus, 75-80. ינ' Probus, 81-91. s»2 The various problems about the Essenes, especially the slight variations between the account by Josephus in B. J. II, 8, 2-13, need not be treated here. Cf. Colson IX, pp. 514-516.</page><page sequence="165">[165] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 315 the Essenes are formed in the likeness of the great sages. But Philo's description of the Therapeutae, on the other hand, reads almost as though it was constructed out of the phrases and conceptions which Philo uses in tracing the career of Abraham. Philo begins his treatise, De Vita Contemplativa, by alluding to his previous work which depicts the Essenes as exemplars of those who led the active (τνρακτίκόν) life, and then proceeds to describe, in contrast, the exemplars of the contemplative life. As we shall see, the contemplative life accords in many details with the career of Abraham; it seems likely that Philo conceived of a similar accord between the Essenes as exponents of the life of perfection through ασκησυς of which Jacob is his exemplar. Philo does not make these associations explicit; it is the more readily discernible in the case of the Therapeutae and Abraham than in the case of the Essenes and Jacob. Nevertheless, the contrast between the Therapeutae and the Essenes is the same as the contrast between Abraham and Jacob; perfection by meditation and contemplation as distinct from perfection through action. The name Therapeutae, as derivable from the root meaning to cure, alludes, Philo tells us, to the cure of the soul; the sickness of the soul consists of those things inflicted by the passions and the vices. This is reminiscent, in general effect though not in language, of Philo's interpretation of Abraham's conquest of the nine kings of Gen. 14.393 The name, as derivable from a root meaning to worship, means that the Therapeutae were taught by nature and the sacred laws to worship To 0n.w They did not revere the elements, for these are lifeless; nor the deified beasts of Egypt. Like Abraham, the Therapeutae are taught by nature; like Abraham they reject the "pantheism" represented by Chaldea, as well as the other "false" religions of Philo's day.395 393 A br. 236-244. 394 VC 1-2. In the passage Philo contrasts the worship of to ov which is purer purer than the tvos and more primordial than the novàs. Colson IX, 114-115 cites Zeller, Presocratics (English translation) vol. I, 309 ff., for this type of distinction in Pythagoreanism. What Philo is saying, for our purposes, is that the Therapeutae worshiped what is God, the ultimate reality, rather than some intermediate entity. 39s VC 3-9.</page><page sequence="166">316 SAMUEL SANDMEL [166] Like Abraham, the Therapeutae want the vision of To On, and they therefore rise above sense perception; they too are carried away by a heaven-sent love, and they too become rapt and possessed like bacchanals or corybants until they see the object of their yearning.3'6 Like Abraham, the Therapeutae leave their homes and their kinfolk.3'7 The Therapeutae, like Abraham, do not migrate simply from one city to another city; instead they pass their days outside the walls.3'8 The Therapeutae include many who give utterance, when asleep or dreaming, to the verities of their holy philoso phy. What Philo seems to be saying indirectly is that there are prophets among the Therapeutae.3" At sunset the Therapeutae want to relive the experience of Abraham and be wholly relieved of the press of the senses.400 The Therapeutae are allegorists, who penetrate beyond the literal texts to antecedent "nature."401 The πρβσβύτατος among the Therapeutae gives a discourse on the Sabbath. The discourse is not clever rhetoric or sophistry, but is a careful and exact expression of the meaning of the thoughts.402 396 VC 10-12; cf. Abr. 68 ff.: Abraham departs from those who glorify visible existence; he opens his soul's eye; the mist of sense is dispelled and Abraham receives the vision of To On. Cf. also Heres 69-70, for an almost identical passage on heavenly love, divine possession, and yearning for To On. 397 VC 13 and 18; cf. Mig. 1 ff. 398 VC 19. Cf. Abr. 85: Abraham migrated "not . . . from state to state but into a desert country." 399 VC 26; cf. Heres 264-266. 4»» VC 27; cf. Philo's interpretation of "about sunset there fell upon him an ecstasy," Gen. 15.17, Heres 263. 401 VC 28. The essence of Abraham, it will be recalled, is that he lived according to nature. The Therapeutae, then, are interested in the life which accords with nature. They possess the writings of men of old which point out the way to allegorical interpretation. 402 VC 31. Abraham was called the "elder" in Gen. 24.1, an epithet which according to Sob. 17-18 has to do with one's soul and not with one's age. Abraham passed beyond the stage of fshmael, sophistry, Sob. 8. Abraham was blessed with both good thoughts and good speech, Mig. 70 ff. Philo gives this explanation of "elder" later on, in VC 67.</page><page sequence="167">[167] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 317 Philo's contrast of the banquet of the Therapeutae with Greek banquets, as exemplified in the Symposium of Plato, leads him to describe the Platonic banquet in terms almost identical with those he uses in denouncing the Sodomites: cities are deso lated, the best kind of men become scarce, sterility and child lessness ensue, and the like.403 The Therapeutae contemplate nature, and live in the soul alone.404 The Therapeutae, then, are those who lived the life of which Abraham was the exemplar, as the Essenes are those who lived the life of which Jacob was the exemplar. Reverting to the matter discussed earlier, the Essenes and the Therapeutae serve Philo as his proof that it is possible in his day for men to live by metaphysical principle. Philo's use of Abraham seems, in its way, to be Philo's calling upon ante cedent history for attestation that such a life was possible in the past. In this light, some of the introductory phrases of De Abrahamo 403 VC 60-62; cf. Abr. 135-136. Philo seems to equate by implication the "Italian expensiveness and luxury" with the wealth of the Sodomites and their gluttony; VC 48 and Abr. 133-134. 4°4 VC 90. I have been led to wonder if the title "contemplative life" gives the true import of the Greek jSios θίωορητίκός. The Greek means basically "seeing," a connotation that seems to me inevitably lacking in the term "contemplative," though the word does have the dictionary meaning of "looking upon." This meaning, however, has become secondary to something like "consider with attention or thoughtfulness." The point to be made is that for Philo the highest religious experience is the seeing of God, and in the measure that "The Contemplative Life" fails to connote that it is the life which concerns itself with "seeing" God, the phrase is unintentionally de ficient. The Therapeutae, like Abraham, are those concerned with the life of the "sight" of God. Philo makes this clear about Abraham in a number of passages: there is, he says, Mig. 165, an intimate connection between seeing and contemplation (τω 156 θΐωρητίκω τό όραν συνωδόν re καί οίκαότατον). The change in Abraham's nature implicit in his change of name is his passing from concern for the sight of his eyes to concern for the sight of his soul. The sight of the soul is the "contemplative" life; and Abraham is for Philo the chief exponent of contemplation, for the reason that the Bible records that Abraham received the vision of God; cf. Abr. 84 and Mut. 3-6; 66-76. Philo's allegory of Abraham, we saw, was his demonstration that Abra ham rose above the body to live by his soul.</page><page sequence="168">[168] 318 SAMUEL SANDMEL cease to be mere rhetorical devices and become living and im portant words to Philo: the lives of the patriarchs appear in the books of the Law not only because such men lived good and blameless lives. But Moses wants to do more than to sound their praises; he wants to instruct the reader and to induce him to aspire to be like these men. Since these men were *έμψυχοι και λογικοί νόμοι, Moses mentions them for two reasons: first, he wants to show that the enacted ordinances are not inconsistent with nature; and second, that those who wish to live in accord ance with the laws as they now stand have no difficult task, because the first generation followed the unwritten law of which the written is only a record. It seems unmistakable that Philo has attributed to Moses Philo's own desire: to instruct the reader and to induce him to be like the patriarchs. Abraham, then, is one of the models after whom a man can in a later generation model his life. The study of Abraham, then, clearly reveals what to Philo is the true and significant religiosity. It is not only the observance of the particular laws, the Law of Moses. Beyond them true religiosity is the living in accord with nature, the rise of the soul above the obstacles of the body; the determination not to be contaminated by the evils inherent in the city, but to live in a pure state as though one were in heaven, and to receive the divine afflatus as the end result of the proper life. In the way that Philo's Abraham differs from the rabbinic Abraham, in the same way the essential religiosity of Philo differs from that of the rabbis. No matter how much Philo exalts the Law of Moses, no matter how consistent he proves it to be with the Law of nature, the Law of Moses is at best a copy, and thereby inescapably secondary. Philo concedes to his environment what the rabbis never felt need of conceding, or if they felt the need, would never have been willing or able to do: Philo admits that there is something more basic than the Law of Moses, something antecedent to the Law. Only in a thoroughly hellenistic environment, with the implicit dualism of the material and the immaterial, and with the echoes of Platonism everywhere ringing, however faintly, in the ear, is such a concession at all admissible.</page><page sequence="169">[169] PHILO S PLACE IN JUDAISM 319 The allegorists who do not observe the literal law405 are those who have succumbed entirely to the Greek spirit. However much Philo, who abides by the Laws of Moses, denounces them for their lack of observance, his admission that they are right in seeing beyond the literal406 seems to doom his own position. He will defend the Law of Moses to the best of his abilities, but what he is defending against the allegorists is the body of Scripture, the second best, and he is defending it against, as it were, the soul, which he must concede is the "first best." Philo is so thoroughly hellenized that his loyalty to Judaism is everywhere shaped by his simultaneous agreement with the contentions of the extreme allegorists. The Greek cast of his thought is so germane to him that he truly believes that the religious and philosophical system which his thought inhabits, is a Jewish creation, stemming from Moses, and that Plato and other Greek worthies were latter-day imitators and plagiarists. Philo seems to believe this implicitly; his hellenization is so thorough and so complete that undoubtedly he himself was unaware of how Greek his Judaism is. His Abra ham, whom he exalts as an example of Jewish perfection, achieves that perfection in terms of Greek salvation. Philo himself is as hellenized as is his Abraham; his Abraham is portrayed in the author's image.407 Respecting Philo's Abraham and the Abraham of the Apoc rypha and Pseudepigrapha, we are again struck with the absence of connection and relationship. I have been able to discover not one single item of any substance which would bind Philo's view to the views in the other literatures. The single possible exception is the common motif that Abraham was the first man to discover the existence of God; but even in this item in which some com munity of view might be alleged, Philo's explanation of the manner of Abraham's discovery again separates him. 4»5 Mig. 89 ff. 406 Cf. Con}. 190. 407 There are several passages in which Philo makes a personal application of the scriptural lesson he has inferred about Abraham. He urges his own soul to imitate Abraham's migration, Heres 69 ff. Philo, too, wanted to beget out of virtue, Sarah, Cong. 6, cf. Mut. 255 ff. The mating with the encyclia is Philo's experience also, Cong. 88. The ecstasis of Abraham, Heres 68, is paral leled by Philo's own ecstasis, Mig. 34-35■</page><page sequence="170">320 SAMUEL SANDMEL [170] It is only with Josephus and with the rabbis that there are random overlapping items. With Josephus these are extremely occasional and of no telling significance. It remains now to assess the alleged overlappings, and their, to me, distorted significance in some of the scholarly writings. VII Two different matters now concern us. First, it will be contended that there are significant and decisive contrasts between the Abraham of the rabbis and the Abraham of Philo, and that these contrasts accord with the contrast in the fundamental religiosities of the rabbis and Philo. Second, it will be contended that the alteration which Philo makes of the biblical patriarch is not a re-writing of "normative" traditions and views of Abraham, but that Philo creates his Abraham independent of the rabbis. There are these contrasts to be noted as preliminaries. The Abraham of the rabbis is arrived at through exegesis of the Hebrew Bible, the Abraham of Philo from the Septuagint. There fore Philo's exegesis will follow what the Septuagint offers and not the Massoretic Text. Philo as we saw, interprets his Abraham in Gen. 12.9, as going into the desert, instead of going south ward.408 To Philo this is a commendable act of the philosophic mystic; the desert and not Palestine is, in fact, the goal of Abra ham's migration. Gen. 14.21 portrays the king of Sodom as offering to Abra ham what MT describes as רכוש and LXX as 'ίππον Philo's exegesis draws a contrast between the irrational animal and rational man. In Gen. 15.11, the Septuagint renders the singular ayitayit by the plural ornea; it renders "drove them away" by "sat down with them." In both cases Philo's allegory is based on the Septuagint; in the first case, he renders the birds as the passions, and in the second case, he portrays Abraham as sitting down with the passions like a chairman, and calling them to order. The use 408 'pjjg ra[3bis read into "southward" the notion that Abraham headed towards the site of the Temple; Gen. R. XXXIX.</page><page sequence="171">[171] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 321 of different versions of the Bible leads to different conclusions where the versions differ. Second, the rabbinic exegesis is a totality of legends and utter ances stemming from many centuries and countless individual interpreters, whereas the exegesis of Philo, however variegated it may occasionally be, is single-minded and, within limits, con sistent. The rabbinic Abraham however must be pieced together from countless disparate and occasionally dissonant passages. Third, the rabbinic Abraham is couched in terms of the popular mind, while the Philonic represents philosophical and mystical meditation, and the Philonic view, especially of esoteric allegory, is suitable only for the few and not for the many. Fourth, the comparison between the Philonic and rabbinic Abraham can be made only in the light of basic exclusions. Philo, as stated, gives us not even one legendary narrative. On the other hand, the allegorical quantities assigned by Philo and his associates are not found in the rabbis. It is therefore necessary for one who draws a contrast to bear in mind that while Philo and the rabbis apply exegesis, it is a different mode of exegesis. Philo's Abraham is depicted in only those incidents which occur in the Bible. The rabbinic Abraham is provided with an early youth. Philo alludes only passingly to Abraham's youth; he lacks the stories of the iconoclasms and Nimrod. Philo shows no knowledge of Abraham as a missionary; rather, his Abraham is an exemplar of the proselyte. The rabbis portray Abraham as coming to the knowledge of God through an observation of astronomical phenomena. Philo knows such a tradition ; it is found in his hellen istic predecessors; he rejects, however, astronomical observation as being equivalent to atheism, and he insists that the proper rec ognition of the existence of God comes from one's turning inward and by deducing the existence of a Mind in the universe from the existence of a mind in man. The rabbis portray Abraham's victory over the kings in extravagant, miraculous terms, especially focused on the phrase (Gen. 14.15) wa-yefyaleq 'aleyhem layla, "he divided the night against them" ; Philo gives a most naturalistic picture of a sudden night attack. Mamre in the rabbis is the name of a person; Mamre in Philo</page><page sequence="172">322 SAMUEL SANDMEL [172] is the name of a region and not a person, even in the occurrence of the name with Aner and Eshkol in Gen. 14.24. Philo pays no attention to the "test" of Abraham in Gen. 22.1]22.1] he shows no knowledge of the tests expanded by the rabbis and by Jubilees into ten. Philo shows no knowledge of the atoning power of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah as a reminder of Isaac's binding. The rabbis interpret the three visitors of Gen. 18 as Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Philo interprets the chapter as the manner in which the vision of God presents itself to different minds. The rabbis infer from the exegesis of Gen. 14.17, 'emek ha melek,melek, that the surviving kings, in appreciation of Abraham's military might, proclaim him a king. Philo, too, knows Abraham as a king, but this rests not on exegesis but on a direct statement: LXX Gen. 23.6 renders נשיא by βασιλεύχ. The context establishes that for the rabbis Abraham's kingship rests on his military prowess; Philo expressly denies that Abraham was a king of this type, and he insists that Abraham was the "philosopher-king." In specific details, then, the connection between the Abraham of the rabbis and the Abraham of Philo is demonstrably negative. A consideration of the over-all conception of Abraham reveals that this disparity in details abides thorough-goingly. The Abraham of the rabbis is basically an exemplar of the ancestor who lived in accordance with Jewish law, both the Law of Moses and the developed Oral law, commended by the rabbis to his descendants. The Abraham of Philo lived by the natural law of which the Mosaic law was only a copy. Philo in no place suggests that Abraham had anything to do with the Oral law; indeed, the greatness of Abraham was his capacity for living by the higher law, and to have made him an observer of the details of law would have removed for Philo Abraham's uniqueness. The Laws of Moses are for Philo the record of what Abraham did; the Laws of Moses conform to the laws of nature; but the great ness of Abraham was his capacity for actually living by nature. Philo is not interested in portraying Abraham as an observer of the Law, even though Philo admires such an observer. Abraham is Philo's proof that there is a law antecedent to the Laws of Moses, and that it is possible for a man to live by that law.</page><page sequence="173">[173] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 323 The Abraham of the rabbis is a "folk-character"; the Abra ham of Philo is a deep and profound philosopher, educated in the various disciplines of the university; a philosopher, and a mystic. Philo's Abraham is not the rabbi who is busy with the details of exegesis as discussed in the Academy, learning daily from God a new halaka; Philo's Abraham is the mystic who periodically must forsake the busy city and its contaminations for a quiet retreat in the wilderness and for the contemplation there of the nature of God that leads to the vision of God. The rabbis, not dividing man into opposing aspects of soul and body, have no need of portraying Abraham as one who rose above body into living in conformity with the intelligible world. The banquet which the rabbis describe Abraham as giving for Isaac at the time of the weaning reveals exactly those aspects of sensual pleasure which Philo denounced as Italian and which he associated with the wealth of the Sodomites. The religiosity of the rabbinic Abraham is that of conformity with divine law, enjoined through Moses and his legitimate successors, and Abra ham's greatness was his pious obedience to these commandments, and his subsequent rewards, both in this world and in the world to come. The religiosity of Philo's Abraham is his rejection of the body and of everything sensual, his conformity with the unwritten laws of nature, and the reabsorption of his mind, at his death, into the divine Mind. The religiosity of the rabbinic Abraham, despite his being a prophet, is the religiosity of the pious observer of objective laws; the religiosity of Philo's Abra ham is the successful attainment of salvation by rising above bodily contaminations into mystic union with God. Insofar as the role of Abraham is decisive, it can be said that the religiosity of the rabbis and the religiosity of Philo differ substantially.409 Their common base, the Bible, provides a de ceptive similarity; that both Philo and the rabbis were "loyal Jews" adds to the deceptive quality of the apparent similarity. In essentials, however, the religiosities are markedly diverse. 4°י Moore's words respecting the destiny of the soul after death are appropriate to the respective religiosities of Philo and the Rabbis: "What to Philo would have seemed the greatest imaginable evil was to the Pharisees the highest conceivable good." (II, 295).</page><page sequence="174">324 SAMUEL SANDMEL [174] Those who insist that Philo's essential religiosity is no dif ferent from the rabbis go on to aver that Philo inherits the rabbinic tradition. Wolfson, we remember, calls Philo a member of a collateral branch of Pharisaic Judaism. Apparently on a basis suggested by Ginzberg, Wolfson would explain the nature of Philonic Judaism as that of turning popular religion into phil osophical religion. Ginzberg410 speaks of utterances of Philo as revealing on close scrutiny sound rabbinic doctrines, the philo sophical tinsel of which can easily be removed. The assertion made above, that Philo's essential religiosity differs from that of the rabbis, does not depend for its justifica tion on demonstrating that Philo is independent of rabbinic tradi tion. Philo might have come to his philosophical mysticism from the doctrines of the rabbis. The case that Philo's religiosity is different can be strengthened by a demonstration that Philo is independent of the rabbis; but the case can stand without this item. It is in order, however, to examine some of the matters presented by Ginzberg and Wolfson in contention that it specif ically is rabbinic doctrines which Philo is turning into philos ophy.411 Ginzberg412 implies a relationship between the rabbinic notion that Abraham was a king, and the Philonic. It was shown above that the rabbinic notion derived from scriptural exegesis of Gen. 14.17 while the Philonic was directly stated in the Septua gint, Gen. 23.6. Ginzberg cites in support of the notion that the rabbis did not really conceive of Abraham as a political king a passage in Gittin 62a; this passage simply states on the basis of Proverbs 8.15, that scholars are called kings. The passage makes no mention of Abraham; it specifies no details of the nature of the kingship of the Sage, such as Philo gives abundantly. The implied parallelism seems completely lacking. Ginzberg does not directly state that Philo's elaboration of 410 V, p. ix. 411 I limit myself to those matters associated by Philo with Abraham. The frequency with which Wolfson equates some rabbinic doctrine with a Philonic notion makes it necessary to adopt this limit. 4,2 Ginzberg V, p. 216.</page><page sequence="175">[175] PHILO'S PLACE IN JUDAISM 325 Abraham's departure from home is dependent on the rabbis; he only mentions it as a parallel. In detail the views of the de parture have nothing in common (as a comparison of Abr. 62-67 with Gen. R. 39 will reveal). The expansions are quite dissimilar; they are based on the Bible, not one on the other.413 Again, the agreement of the rabbis and Philo that Abraham was a blessing and that the good man is a blessing, is rooted in the Bible,414 in Gen. 12 and elsewhere. Ginzberg speaks of Philo as paralleling the rabbis in portray ing Sarah, in Egypt, in prayer to God. The rabbis quote her prayer.415 Philo says, to give a literal translation of Abr. 95, that Sarah "fled with him (sc. Abraham) to the last championship, that of God." Philo does not specifically say that Sarah or Abraham prayed. But even if Philo had mentioned prayer specifi cally, it would not imply that Philo is dependent on the rabbis; Gen. 12.17, is a sufficient basis for its natural inference.416 Ginzberg sees parallelism in the rabbinic and Philonic por trayal of the battle against the Kings. While the rabbis imply and Philo states explicitly that Abraham trusted in God, the parallelism ends there. Beyond this matter, readily deducible from Scripture, Ginzberg does not seem to notice that Philo portrays Abraham as dividing his home-born servants into three centuries (ίκατονταρχιαϊ) and advancing with three battal ions;4" Ginzberg errs in attributing to Philo a view that Abra ham possessed only home-born servants; Philo speaks also of the αργυρωνήτου. Philo here seems to me to be as far as possible removed from the rabbis.418 Ginzberg419 believes that the statement in Abr. 71 is an almost literal rendering of the Hebrew expression צא מאיצטגנינות. This expression occurs in Gen. R. 44 as a comment on Gen.15.5; Abra ham is portrayed as informing God that he has seen by the planets 4ני Ginzberg V, 218-219■ 4,4 Ibid., 219■ 4's Ginzberg translates it, I, 223. 416 Ginzberg V, 221. 41' Abr. 232. 418 Ginzberg V, 224. 41» Ibid., 227.</page><page sequence="176">326 SAMUEL SANDMEL [176] that he will not have any offspring. God therefore tells him to "come out from astrology." In the passage in Philo astrology is not to be equated merely with forecasting, but with pantheistic materialism. Colson renders the passage in Philo: "Dismiss, then, the rangers of the heavens and the science of Chaldea, and depart for a short time from the greatest of cities, this world, to the lesser, and thus you will be better able to apprehend the over seer of the All." In the Philonic context, the departure from Chaldea is a spiritual experience; Abraham, made perfect by instruction, abandons pantheism with its method of sensible observations for a method which is to lead to intelligible knowl edge. In terms of context, the two passages have at best only superficial resemblances, and they do not require the necessary dependence of either Philo on the rabbis or the rabbis on Philo. Ginzberg suggests that an identical view is "very likely" expressed in Philo's statement that Abraham desisted from Hagar after her pregnancy and in the rabbinic view, Gen. R. 45, that Hagar became pregnant from a single effort. However, the Abraham of Philo who, in accord with Philo's view, has sex relations only for procreation, is hardly the same as the rabbinic Abraham who succeeds after only one effort. Philo's motive is to show Abraham's freedom from sensuality; the rabbis were not concerned with sensuality; they may have been interested in Sarah's honor, or in diminishing Abraham's unions with an Egyptian, but it is to be doubted that it is their motive to prove abstemiousness. I see no reason for supposing the two motifs to be related.420 The rabbis tell that Abraham's three guests were very cour teous. Philo also speaks of their courtesy.421 Philo derives this courtesy from the fact that although they were three only one spoke; hence, it was courteous of them not to speak all at once. The rabbis infer the courtesy in a different way; the chapter Gen. 18 begins: God appeared to Abraham at elone Mamre; it continues "he raised his eyes and saw three men." The rabbis infer that two different visits took place almost simultaneously, 20יי Ginzberg V, 231-232. ■21י Abr. 110-132.</page><page sequence="177">[177] PHILO's PLACE IN JUDAISM 327 one by God and one by three angels. Since the Shekinah per mitted the visitors first to speak, Abraham knew they were worthy; by observing that they respected each other Abraham knew that they were distinguished. The rabbis do not specify in what way they showed respect for each other. There is in sufficient data here to indicate borrowing on either side.422 Philo's comment that Abraham himself ran to the cattle is not paralleled in the otherwise lavish compliments the rabbis pay his hospitality.423 The statement that the angels did not really eat is found in the rabbis, Philo, and Josephus. The matter is hardly, however, an expansion of this story, but is part of the more general ques tion ("docetism") of whether or not angels ate. Ginzberg describes Abr. 142 as a haggadah similar to the rabbinic legends of Gen. 18 that the three visitors were Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Of these only Gabriel and Raphael went on to Sodom, the former to destroy the city, the latter to save Lot. These haggadahs have some similarity to each other, but they both rest on the same scriptural basis. The Rabbis solve the problem of the discrepancies in number in Gen. 18.1-12 by equating the three visitors with Michael, Gabriel, and Raph ael. Philo solves the problem by considering the variation be tween one and three to be the manner in which the Divine potencies appear to men, either in the form of one or of three. In Wolfson's discussion424 he makes by implication an identifica tion of the visitors in Philo with the angels of the rabbis, though he concedes that Philo does not ever name any angels. Wolfson does not go as far, in this instance, as to term Philo's discussion of the Powers a conversion of a popular motif into a philosophical one, but this quite clearly seems his intent.425 To my mind, the similarity of the explanations is so easily accountable by the *" Ginzberg V, 234• 4«4« Ginzberg V, 235. 4*4 Ibid. I, 126 and 378-381. 4« Wolfson seems to be misinterpreting Goodenough ; he seems to infer that Goodenough, 79-80, denies to Philo the existence of angels. All that Goodenough is denying is that to Philo the angels have fixed personalities, names, and distinct functions.</page><page sequence="178">328 SAMUEL SANDMEL [178] common scriptural account that dependence of Philo on the rab bis is not indicated. Philo's interpretation is readily derivable from Scripture; to require a rabbinic legend as an intermediary would be to imply that he was unable himself to expound Scrip ture. Ginzberg, in limiting himself to terming the haggadahs similar, has remained within the realm of the plausible. Philo's explanation accords so well with his numerous comments, in very many passages, on the Powers of God, that one need not be surprised that he turns this handy passage into a quite typically Philonic interpretation.426 Philo's ascription of licentiousness and gluttony to the Sod omites is not paralleled in these particulars in rabbinic literature. Scripture specifies the homosexuality of the Sodomites, and the wealth of the region. Philo's ascetic strain leads him to stress their sensuality. The rabbis stress the injustice and the sexual irregularity, but not the gluttony.427 The rabbis and Philo accord in the view that the punishment of Sodom did not come directly from God. The rabbis ascribe the punishment to God'srourt of justice. Philo says that although To To On gives benefits through his own hand, punishments come at the hands of the Powers.428 Ginzberg429 believes that this is an example of Philo's tendency: "To give a philosophic turn to a popular conception is one of Philo's chief merits." But Gen. 19.13, portrays the two angels saying, "We are going to destroy, etc.," while verse 24 says, "God rained down sulphur and fire." Hence the Bible can be the source of Philo's explanation; there is no reason to assume that a popular rabbinic conception stands between Philo and the Bible. Ginzberg«0 suggests that since all creation rejoiced at the birth of Isaac, this is an explanation of the name similar to Philo's allegory of Isaac as joy. The rabbis do not ever explain Isaac's name as other than "laughter." Philo explains this "joy," as the Sage's spiritual joy, transcending ordinary laughter. 426 Ginzberg V, 237. 42ל Ginzberg V, 238. 428 Abr. 143-145; cf.

It was indicated above434 that Philo refrains from attaching to the Binding narrative either the motif of the testing of Abraham or the atoning power of the act as symbolized by the ram. It seems to me that Ginzberg misses entirely the point of Philo's remarks. Philo is polemical and apologetic about the incident; his "diffuse" comments are his reply to the malignity and bitterness of the critics of Abraham ; the reply does no more than assert that Abraham's action proved his piety. The chief impression made on me in reading the passage was not any sense at all that the Binding was important to Alexandrian Jews, but rather that it was a somewhat embarrassing story which needed defense.435 Ginzberg paraphrases a comment by Philo respecting the mourning of Abraham for Sarah, and adds that "this last remark of Philo is often met with in Jewish writings." The remark which Ginzberg attributes to Philo is that Abraham mourned a short time only, for the wise do not feel sorry when restoring to God the deposit entrusted to them. Philo, however, has said some thing entirely different: Philo says that Abraham neither grieved overly bitterly as at a new and unheard of misfortune, nor did he assume an indifference as though nothing painful had occurred; he chose the mean between extremes and aimed at moderation, not resenting that nature should be paid the debt which is its due.436 The rabbinic comment is completely different from what «1 43!431 Abr. 176 and Pesigta Rabbati XL. «2 Ginzberg V, 251.

Ginzberg's paraphrase reads, "The pious feel like strangers in this world, they are at home in the other world only." The contrast which Philo is drawing is between material and immaterial things, a contrast quite foreign to rabbinic thought.439 It is quite startling to read a paraphrase of Philo which implies a contrast between this world and the future world; I have not encountered this rabbinic contrast in Philo.440 Ginzberg suggests, though only tentatively, that in Philo's view Gen. 26.5, refers to the Torah which Abraham observed before the revelation on Sinai.441 The passage says nothing about the revelation on Sinai ; as above, Philo does not teach that Abra ham observed the Torah, but that the written Torah is the record of what Abraham did. The verse is also expounded in Mig. 130, with reference to "doing" the Logos, and nothing is specified about what "law" was involved. Again, when Philo quotes the verse in Heres 7-14, he makes no mention of what law is referred to. It can be stated confidently that Philo is not of the opinion that Gen. 26.5, refers to the Law of Moses.442 Both the rabbis and Philo call Abraham an elder; the epithet, however, has a biblical basis, Gen. 24.1, and dependency is not necessarily indicated.443 «MflJVXIV. 438 Ginzberg V, 255. «י Cf.

It is not, however, indicative of borrowing. The rabbis seem to know only this of the many etymologies which Philo knows and which the Bible does not itself give.444 The case seems then to be that the parallels, on examination, are not nearly as crystal-clearly parallel as Ginzberg (and Wolf son) imply. One who looks into them is struck immediately by the reduced measure of commonness and the striking measure of diversity. An effect of pointing up the parallels and alleging dependency is to imply that Philo and the Alexandrians were incapable of interpreting the Bible on their own. It overlooks the fact that interpretation of ancient books, by the allegorical method, was by no means unknown in the hellenistic world.445 It seems to allege that Philo and his associates could approach Scripture only through the medium of developed rabbinic Judaism. It would deny to Philo a capacity to do what Gentile Christians were gifted at, but without the Christians requiring a rabbinic basis. I should not be ready to deny that some Palestinian traditions are in Philo's possession. But I have seen no evidence in many alleged parallels either that persuasive parallelism occurs in any measure, or, where similarities are superficially present, that Philo is giving a philosophical turn to a rabbinic popular senti ment. Indeed, as one notes the wide differences in details along with the bits of Philonic and rabbinic similarities, he tends all the more to see in Philo someone outside the ultimately dominant rabbinic Judaism, And as one concerns himself with larger aspects, such as the significance of Abraham, he sees a helleniza tion that is thoroughgoing and complete.446 4,!יי Ibid.., 264• 4« Cf.

Second, Philo's view of Judaism differs from that of the rabbis as philosophical mysticism based on the Bible differs from halakic legalism. Three, Philonic Judaism is the result of a hellenization which transcends mere language; it is as complete a hellenization as was possible for a group which retained throughout its loyalty to the Torah, and the separateness of the group. Fourth, as contrastable with normative, rabbinic Judaism, Philo and his associates reflect a marginal, aberrative version of Judaism which existed at a time when there were many versions of Judaism, of which ultimately only Rabbinism and Christianity have survived to our day. exegetical training and his actual knowledge in matters Jewish to that school of Alexandrine commentators whose methods were perfected by himself. . .
