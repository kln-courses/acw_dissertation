Individual object labels identified and interpreted key graphic symbols. "Bogolan's Rural Roots" served as the foil against which the revitaliza- tion of bogolan in urban areas resonated. The main focus of the exhibition was bogolan's urban renewal, a complex and multi- faceted phenomenon. Rovine has made this complexity comprehensible by organizing the objects into three sections: "Tourist Market Bogolan"; "Studio Art"; and "Bogolan Fashion." Tourist market bogolan consists of two types: cloths which mimic the look of traditional wrappers and cloths with painted representa- tional images that are sold as decorative wall hangings. Most of the market textiles are made of handwoven cotton strips, are hand dyed, and use bold graphic designs similar to those on the women's wrappers in the "Rural Roots" section. These features give them the desirable aura of tradition and authenticity which sellers emphasize to potential customers. Here, the similarity ends. For most of the mimetic mar- ket cloths, both the organization of the design field and the number of motifs are greatly sim- plified. Unlike the women's wrappers, they have no clear horizontal orientation and no identifiable top and bottom. Created as yard goods rather than for use as a specific type of garment, many tourist market textiles are pro- duced using simple stenciled designs repeated to produce an all-over pattern. In some cases the designs are painted in dark dyes directly on the cloth, reversing the figure-ground relation- ship of the "source" cloths. As Rovine points out, these transforma- tions in design, technique, and the organiza- tion of production are intentional. Creating a simplified overall pattern allows the market textiles to be more readily cut and pieced for tailored clothing and domestic furnishings. More important, reducing the complexity of the design field and introducing stenciling and different painting techniques speeds up pro- duction and thus significantly reduces costs. In the last several decades, Bamako market entre- preneurs have organized workshops employ- ing groups of artisans to mass-produce textiles in order to meet the growing demand for yard goods. These textiles are sold to both Malians and tourists and are increasingly being export- ed to retailers worldwide. In the "Studio Art" section, Rovine select- ed nine paintings by five contemporary Malian painters who have embraced the idea of bogolan -its technique or its system of sym- bols or both-and adapted it for use on stretched canvas. These artists have done so on ideological grounds; like the market sell- ers, they identify bogolan as traditional and Malian. However, they see its incorporation into their postmodern paintings as a way to preserve and revitalize this distinctly national art genre, and disseminate it worldwide. Their paintings do not reproduce bogolan tex- tiles. Rather, the artists recognize and pay homage to the source while creatively trans- forming it into what they define as a wholly new and authentic Malian modern art form. "Bogolan Fashion," the third section, fea- tured the work of Malian clothing designers. Among the objects displayed were tailored vests, fashion scarves, tote bags, and a costume designed for a feature film. Many of the men and women were graduates of the National Arts School and had trained as painters, and some of their work was also featured in the Fine Arts section. Like those who produce for the market, these designers often use stencils and direct painting techniques. Their designs, how- ever, are generally more complex, and their production techniques more time consuming and labor intensive. A group of four men's gar- ments designed by Alou Traore stood out in this section. They were modeled after the pop- ular man's boubou, a long tunic decorated with embroidered designs at the neckline, on the sleeves, and on the upper front and back. The tunic is worn over pants. In postcolonial Mali the embroidered boubou has taken on the status of men's national dress. Traore used bogolan techniques to create elaborate designs with complex stencils and designs painted directly on the cloth. He oriented the motifs vertically down the center, front and back, similar to the orientation of embroidery on men's boubous. A final section of the exhibition, "American Adaptations," focused on the increasing popu- larity of bogolan abroad. In the international marketplace its association with Bamana or Mali is frequently lost, and these textiles with their bold graphics have taken on a Pan- African identity. Here one saw a "bogolan" blouse and skirt designed by Norma Kamali, a Liz Claibore T-shirt, and coffee mugs, towels, sheets, stationery, and wrapping paper deco- rated with bogolan motifs. Throughout the exhibition Rovine skillfully teased out Malian discourses about tradition, authenticity, and modernity as the featured artists and entrepreneurs define them in their engagement with the revitalization of bogolan textiles. There was orily one missed opportunity. In "Bogolan's Rural Roots," one of the women's wrappers was hung vertically and one upside down. This, unfortunately, visually negated the fact that they are garments meant to be worn around the body. The orientation of wrappers and their design fields is distinctly horizontal. The cloths have a clear top and bottom. There are five named design zones, each carrying differ- ent groups of symbols. The central design field, the largest and most complex graphically, is framed by narrower bands on the right and left and on the bottom and top. The right, left, and bottom bands of the wrapper are often of equal visual weight and complexity. The top band is usually quite a bit narrower and generally con- tains only one simple ideograph. Hanging all the wrappers correctly and including a graphic label explaining how to read these cloths as gar- ments would have clarified the artists' intent. It would also have given more weight to the more subtle comparisons between these cloths and urban bogolan in the later sections. This, howev- er, is a minor criticism. "Renewing Tradition" is an excellent exhibition. D "Renewing Tradition" will be on exhibit at the DuSable Museum of African-American History in 82 Chicago (dates to be announced), the University Art Museum at the University of California, Santa Barbara (July 10-September 2, 2001), and the Neuberger Museum of Art, State University of New York, Purchase (January 27-May 5, 2002).

KUNST AUS AFRIKA Themen der Kiinstler Staatliches Museum ftir Vilkerkunde Munich, Germany Permanent, opened December 1999 Reviewed by Barbara Thompson In December 1999, only weeks before the turn of the millennium, the Staatliches Museum fur Volkerkunde in Munich reopened its doors to the public viewing of African art. "Kunst aus Afrika: Themen der Kiinstler" (Art of Africa: Themes of the Artists) is the long-delayed rein- stallation of the permanent exhibition, which was dismantled in 1989 for building renova- tions. Although "Kunst aus Afrika" features many of the same objects from the previous installation, a conceptual revision gives it a different face. The museum's African collection includes about 30,000 objects, most of which were col- lected in the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries by such well-known ethnologists and explorers as Karl Weule, Leo Frobenius, and Hans Himmelheber. Having received many of its acquisitions from the curiosity cabinets and private collections of Bavaria's nobility, the museum also houses a substantial collection of African royal arts from the six- teenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, which add to the quality, diversity, and histor- ical value of its holdings. Early in the twenti- eth century, African art played a significant role in the institution's exhibition history. In 1926 African artworks filled five galleries. Over the years, however, this number has been reduced to the present three galleries displaying about 220 objects, a very small selection of the African holdings. Maria Kecskesi, the now retired head of the museum's Africa Department, curated the exhi- bition and wrote the companion catalogue of the same name. In that volume she notes that the reduction in gallery space and object num- ber posed serious obstacles to replicating the department's last installation, "Kunst aus dem Alten Afrika" (1982-1986), but these restrictions also opened the path for a revision of earlier frameworks (pp. 6-7). Unlike previous installa- tions, "Kunst aus Afrika" does not give priority to geographic or ethnic distinctions, style char- acteristics, or the display of "classical master- pieces." Re-presenting only part of "Kunst aus dem Alten Afrika," it attempts to revise inter- pretative materials in light of new scholarship, and to exhibit the objects in a manner that reflects contemporary perspectives on the dis- atrican arts * autumn 2000</page><page sequence="2">Left: 1.

With the addition of new acquisitions, "Kunst aus Afrika" does indeed reveal changing tastes in the collection and exhibition of African arts. It also differs from its predecessor in its ap- proach based on the frequently depicted themes used by artists and their patrons. Entering the exhibition, the viewer is greet- ed on one side by a Cross River obasinjom mask and costume and on the other side by a large autumn 2000 ? african arts Nafana bedu mask, meeting the public's expec- tations of imposing African masking tradi- tions. A text panel in this introductory space briefly discusses "Themes of African Artists" and the misconception of artists' anonymity, hinting at the exhibition's intention to reveal, when possible, the names of creators or work- shops. Photographs of artists provide further evidence of the importance of individual iden- tity in art production on the continent. A large map of Africa outlines the names of ethnic groups represented in the exhibition, while a slide show provides some contextual images. The exhibition proper encompasses nine major themes. The first gallery, focusing on the theme "Male and Female Single Figures," fea- tures a small selection of figurative sculpture, such as a classic Aitu-Baule blolo bla (Fig. 1). The next theme, "Pairs-Unity in Duality," is reflect- ed in freestanding figurative couples, male and female pairs composed as single units, and other nonfigurative objects with actual or sym- bolic representations of unity, duality, and relat- ed concepts. A newly acquired pair of Yombe commemorative figures complements more familiar objects from the earlier installation. The theme "Motherhood" is beautifully illustrated by an exquisite larger-than-life-sized Bamileke figure of a pregnant woman with heavy, pendu- lous breasts, indicating previous motherhood. A series of Zaramo mother-and-child and mwana hiti figures and a newly acquired Kamba moth- er-and-child figure exemplify conceptually related treatments of the theme. 'Themes from the Context of Boys' and Girls' Initiation" show- cases a number of figures and masks, diverse in form and style, used in the initiation arts. The centerpiece of this gallery is an eye-catching 460-centimeter-long section of an Eton njom (nzom) post surmounted by three male figures, a python, two birds, and slit drum, all carved from a single tree trunk. Only two new acquisi- tions are included in this section, a Tussian female se-pil figure and a standing male figure from the Cross River area. The second gallery, solely devoted to "Chieftaincy, Aristocracy and Priesthood," places on display a distinguished selection of prestige arts from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as Benin, Yoruba, and 83 I</page><page sequence="3">4.

Labels for some of these objects identify the maker, including a veranda post by the Bangwa artist Ateu Atsa and two newly acquired veranda posts by the Yoruba artist Olowe of Ise (Figs. 2, 3). This section also deals with the crosscurrents of foreign influ- ences, especially apparent in excellent examples of "tourist," "export," or "syncretic" arts created from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. The third and last gallery is devoted primari- ly to themes of the supernatural: "Deities, Nature and Ancestral Spirits, Mythological Beings," "Represented Carriers of Magical Powers, Oracles," and "Animals and Combination Beings." It presents many "classic" representa- tions of local spirit powers, such as Kongo minkisi figures, Fang, Kota, and Mahongwe reliquary fig- ures (Fig. 4), and Luba bowl-beaers and caryatid stools. To these mostly central African examples, Kecskesi has added newly acquired figurative groups representing syncretic religious imagery, specifically a red-painted Igbo Mami Wata com- position and an Ibibio interpretation of the myth of the Indian god Hanuman. The selection for the theme "Animals and Combination Beings" focuses on animal iconography as empowering symbols and representations. The large variety of object types and materials, including wood, bark, ivory, cast metal, forged iron, gold foil, terracotta, oil paint, natural pigments, and stone, make this section the most visually compelling. A small portion of this last gallery, called "Utilitarian Objects with Figurative and Non-Figurative Ornamentation," takes advantage of the muse- um's ethnographic agenda. Here Kecskesi pays tribute to the decorative arts with architectural elements, furniture, objects of personal use, con- tainers, instruments, and textiles, among other items. Examples of the "utilitarian" arts from neglected areas of African art-such as decorated San ostrich eggs, Mangbetu barkcoth, and Haya basketry-are a welcome sight among the plethora of more celebrated objects. The newly acquired Luguru high-backed stool, Mbuti bark- doth, and Mangbetu anthropomorphic terra- cotta vessel demonstrate the more inclusive approach in current exhibitions of African art. Text panels provide brief information about each theme. Some of the panels, however, are vertically aligned on a single wall, while the thematic headings separating each section are placed well above the viewer's line of vision. As a result it is difficult to dearly discern dis- tinctions between thematic areas within a sin- gle gallery. Exhibition labels are extremely condensed, seldom longer than two sentences. The companion catalogue, on the other hand, provides collection history and a few para- graphs on each object. Because the valuable information provided in the catalogue does not appear in the exhibition, it is impossible for the museum visitor to distinguish between older and newer acquisitions or to learn about re- vised object interpretations or the use of recent research findings. The history of the object's 84 social life beyond its African context, which often conveys valuable information on Euro- pean colonial and postcolonial history, is there- fore unavailable at the exhibition. A number of objects in "Kunst aus Afrika" do not represent the level of aesthetic quality that one would expect from this museum. In "Chieftaincy, Aristocracy and Priesthood," some beautifill Benin royal artworks from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are fea- tured together with a few noticeably inferior examples of Bini artistry. One example, a gilded bronze pendant of a queen mother, seems a mis- match with its companion "masterpieces." If one turns to the exhibition catalogue, however, Kecskesi explains that the piece is a rare exam- ple of the local brass-casting method merged with a foreign gilding technique (p. 71). A brief mention of the pendant's rarity in the exhibition label would have clarified its inclusion here. Kecskesi notes that objects were chosen not only for their aesthetic quality and appeal, but also for their value in illustrating the exhibition's themes and in meeting its goals (catalogue, pp. 6-7). When such subtle yet crucial points are omitted from the label, an object's artistic short- comings can easily overshadow its informative, interpretative, or thematic worth. "Kunst aus Afrika" endeavors to get away from the ethno- graphic paradigm of dioramas, crowded display cases, and long, authoritative labels or text pan- els, and it also justifiably attempts to critique the notion of the "masterpiece" in African art It does so, however, in a manner that leaves the novice with too many generalizations, which can per- petuate stereotypes. The seasoned viewer, on the other hand, is left with more questions than answers about curatorial intention. Considering the exhibition's focus on the individuality of African artists, one would have expected more information on the "named" artists and workshops featured in the exhibition. The installation does not address the importance of patrons and the relationship between patron- age and the artist's control over theme and iconography. Seldom does an exhibition have such direct access to works by identified African artists. While some of this information is provid- ed in the catalogue, here too, the object labels in the exhibition are wanting. Despite a drastic reduction in the number of objects on display, the galleries still look crowd- ed and confused. This impression is created not so much by an overabundance of objects as by the use of large glass display cases in relatively small galleries in order to accommodate the par- titioning of the exhibition themes. The result, in some areas, is an incoherent visual layering of objects and cases. The installation layout also places works in dead comers. For example, a tall (over 6 feet high!) Vili ndungu drum is wedged into a narrow, dark, and all but hidden corer, as are some Asante okyeame staffs, thereby compro- mising one's appreciation of their three-dimen- sional quality. Insufficient lighting in these and other areas of the installation make it difficult to fully see an object's surface, texture, and subtle visual qualities. After the past decade of financial cutbacks and art-unfriendly national politics, one can rejoice about the reopening of the permanent African art installation in Munich. Although it is apparent, in "Kunst aus Afrika," that the ethno- graphic museum is still struggling with the dif- ficult task of paradigmatic transformations, the institution's willingness to attempt a critique of its own past is certainly well overdue. One wel- comes the opportunity to view some of the most superb artworks from sub-Saharan Africa; nev- ertheless, the new acquisitions are welcome sights to eyes that may be tiring of the same old pieces from the same old places. Indeed, this revision of the museum's past exhibition frame- works and the addition of objects from unfamil- iar, neglected, and rare areas of African art affirm the museum's continued interest in and commitment to the support of African art histo- ry and cultural studies.
