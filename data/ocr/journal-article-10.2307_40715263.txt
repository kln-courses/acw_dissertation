<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT EXHIBITIONS Vincent van Gogh December 20 to February 1 Vincent van Gogh, one of the most significant exhibi- tions to come to this country in the past decade, opens at City Art Museum on Saturday, December 20. The third of the major van Gogh exhibitions to come to the United States, the show was prepared with the cooper- ation of the artist's nephew, Dr. Vincent W. van Gogh, and includes 68 paintings and 50 drawings of superb quality. The exhibition, to be seen in its entirety only at City Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is made up wholly of objects on loan from the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam, the princi- pal collection of the artist's work. Ranging in tone and mood from the early, dark, brood- ing works of Nuenen to the strong, color contrasts and bright, light-filled canvases of the artist's later works, Vincent van Gogh is comprehensively representative of the great Dutch master. Portraiture was Vincent's passion. However, like many struggling artists he could not often afford the model's fee. His still-lifes and landscapes, although not his favorite subjects, exhibit the same love for humanity as do his portraits. Vincent is concerned with human activity. His still-lifes are composed of simple things from daily life, never of precious or delicate objects. He loved the simple life and delighted in portraying an uncomplicated composition of lemons and oranges against the gay and colorful background of a peasant kitchen. His landscapes are also concerned with daily life. They are often agricultural scenes and, as such, re- late the sympathetic relationship of man and nature. Man, through Vincent's eyes, views his world as under- standing, colorful and ordered. The faces in his portraits are aware of this understanding and ordered world. They are open and strong faces, simple and plain, but they have also known hardship. The paintings on view reflect van Gogh's remarkable color craftsmanship. The artist recognized the powerful effects he was able to create by placing complementary colors adjacent to one another. He also knew that there is no stronger color combination possible than that of juxtaposed primary colors. Vincent believed that by applying his colors in these ways the hues would strengthen one another, "then one comes anew to calmness and harmony." Though Vincent sought calmness and harmony in his work, he never found it in his personal* life. At his death in 1890 after a painting career of ten years, he was well known only to a small circle of men who were the most creative artists in France. In the years since his tragic death van Gogh has become one of the most popular creative figures in the history of European art. The exhibition, organized by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, made its debut at the Los Angeles County Mu- seum of Art on October 21. From there, it proceeds to City Art Museum. The paintings alone will then be on view at the Philadelphia Museum while the drawings are exhibited at The Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts, Columbus, Ohio. Vincent van Gogh will be free to the public on Tues- days. On all other days when the Museum is open, admission will be $1 for adults, $.50 for students and free for children under 12 when accompanied by an adult. Payment of an admission fee to Vincent van Gogh will also entitle a visitor to a free admission to Prints and Drawings of the Danube School, on view from December 9 to January 25.

Prints and Drawings of the Danube School December 9 to January 25 In the first half of the 16th century southern Germany and Austria were the setting for one of the great epochs in the history of drawing and printmaking. The artists who worked along the Danube from Regensburg to Vienna were the immediate successors to Albrecht Dürer, the first artist to assimilate the ideas of the Italian Renaissance into the tradition of German art. Unlike Dürer, however, the principal artists of the Danube School - Albrecht Altdorfer, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Wolf Huber - were men of gothic rather than Renaissance taste. In addition to Italian style and icon- ography, Dürer had learned a new attitude toward life: that man dominates nature, a point of view which can be conveyed graphically by giving man an important position and scale in pictorial composition. The outlook of the Danube artists, on the other hand, remained in the German tradition: that nature is the dominant and essential force in life and that there is a symbiotic relationship between nature and man. In the world of the Danube artists nature looms large and teems with unseen forces. Landscape is an ideal subject for such a world view, and the Danube School is credited with the development of landscape in the modern sense. In a print the nominal subject of which may be the Flight into Egypt, the Danube School mini- mizes the scale and placement of the figures and em- phasizes the pulsating, organic character of the forest and even the mountains where the scene occurs. An atmosphere of fantasy pervades the work of the Danube School. In Altdorfer's woodcut St. George and the Dragon mountain peaks are represented by a flame- or wave-like calligraphy akin to Far-Eastern art. In the etching Landscape with Church by Augustin Hirsch- vogel - along with Hans Lautensack the principal sec- ond generation artist of the Danube School - the scene is not merely alive, it is eerily anthropomorphic in a way that bears close comparison to the work of Charles Burchfield. The inheritance of the Danube School from Albrecht Dürer was technical and thematic rather than intellec- tual. From Dürer the Danube artists learned the short- hand of representation necessary to make pictures from a copper plate or wooden block. Dürer was a master printmaker, and his accomplishments and influence were largely responsible for the refinement and ver- satility of this medium in the early 16th century. As in the 15th century, the making of woodcuts re- mained the work of two men: the artist who drew the design on the block and the cutter whose job it was to leave the design in relief. The ability of the cutters employed by Altdorfer and Huber was so advanced that woodcuts by these artists have subtlety and fresh- ness equal to their drawings. Etching, one of the freest and most naturally curvilinear of the printmaking processes, came into widespread use by the second decade of the 16th century and, along with engraving, was regularly used by the artists of the Danube School. On loan from 14 museums and six private collections in Europe and the United States, the more than 120 works of art in Prints and Drawings of the Danube School in- clude many never before exhibited publicly. Organized by Alan Shestack, curator of drawings and prints, and Charles Talbot, assistant professor of the history of art, Yale University, the exhibition will also be seen at the Yale University Art Gallery and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 11</page><page sequence="5">St. George and the Dragon, 1511 Albrecht Altdorfer, German, ca. 1480-1538 woodcut, 7%6 x 5% inches from the current exhibition Prints and Drawings of the Danube School lent by The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</page></plain_text>
