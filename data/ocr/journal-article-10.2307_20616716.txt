<plain_text><page sequence="1">DE NATURA DEORUM 1.65, SAVING THE TEXT There is no need to follow Lambinus (ad Lucr. 1.266) and all subsequent editors in positing a lacuna after Nihil est enim. The text makes sense as given in the manu scripts, and indeed better sense than it does on proposed supplements. The MSS reading is as follows (in the translation, I number the clauses for convenience of reference):</page><page sequence="2">648 SHORTER NOTES nihil est enim quod vacet corpore, corporibus autem omnis obsidetur locus; ita nullum inane, nihil esse individuum potest. (1) for there is nothing that lacks body, but (2) every place is occupied by bodies; thus (3) there can be no void, (4) no indivisible body. There are two grounds for positing the lacuna. First, the preceding claim (quae [sc. atomi] primum nullae sint) demands an argument against the existence of atoms, but the first three clauses in the passage constitute an argument against void. Second, as the text stands primum is unanswered. (Coleman's suggestion that concedam igitur ... in ch. 67 answers to it1 has won little favour.2) Therefore it has been supposed that the argument against atoms has dropped out, and that the final two clauses of the passage state first (3) the conclusion that follows from premises (1) and (2), and second (4) the conclusion of the missing argument. The suggested supplements (reported in Pease and Dyck, ad loc.) hardly improve the matter: (a) nihil est enim &lt;minimum, deinde non est inane, nihil enim est&gt; quod vacet corpore (Lambinus) does not give us an argument, only two virtually tautological assertions: first, there are no atoms because there is no smallest [body]; next, there is no void, because there is nothing that lacks body ... (b) nihil est enim &lt;in rerum natura minimum, quod dividi nequeat; deinde, ut sint, moveriper inane nonpossunt, siquidem iddicis inane&gt; quod vacet corpore (Schoemann) suffers from the same fault: minimum quod dividi nequeat is tautologous with atom, and Schoemann explicitly makes quod vacet corpore synonymous with void. (c) More radically nihil est etiam quod vacet corpore; corporibus autem [or enim] omnis obsidetur locus (Davies) does away with any argument for the existence of atoms. (d) nihil est enim quod vacet corpore, corporibus autem omnis obsidetur locus; &lt;omne autem corpus dividi potest, ut omnis locus&gt; ita nullum inane, nihil esse individuum potest Konstan (as reported by Dyck, p. 146) gives an argument, in which, however clause (1) is irrelevant. If we leave the text alone, there is a decent argument which depends on the prin ciple that the existence of atoms presupposes the existence of void. The void plays two fundamental roles in ancient atomism: it enables the atoms to move and it allows them to be individuals, separate entities. If there were no void, no version of atomic theory could account for the cosmos. There would just be a single mass of matter unable to be divided or to move. An atom, if you like, but unique, and therefore unable to serve as a basic entity in a cosmos. Thus an argument against void amounts to an argument against atoms as well, i.e. (3) entails (4). And the first three clauses of the passage contain (as we shall see) an argument against void. Immediately after this argument is concluded, Cotta, who in DND represents the sceptical Academy, apologizes for basing it on positive physical theories (haec ego nunc physicorum orada fundo, vera an falsa nescio, sed veri tarnen similiora quam vestra (ch. 66).) The physici in question are the Stoics,3 who held that body is the only thing 1 R.G.G. Coleman, 'Cicero De natura deorum I 65 and the Stoic criticism of the atomic theory', Mnemosyne ser.4:13:l (1960), 34-8, makes this suggestion in the course of defending the MS reading. The present paper supports Coleman's conclusion. It construes the argument of the passage somewhat differently from Coleman and attempts to strengthen Coleman's explanation of the lack of a correlative for primum. 2 Dyck (ad loc.) rejects it (A.R. Dyck [ed.], De Natura Deorum liber I [Cambridge, 2003]). 3 Coleman shows this well (op. cit.).</page><page sequence="3">SHORTER NOTES 649 that exists (which can be taken to be logically equivalent to [1] in our passage) and that the cosmos is a plenum (there is no void in the cosmos). They also believed in place, which although it does not exist, nevertheless subsists (v^lorarai) as an 'incor poreal.'4 The doctrine that the cosmos is a plenum (that is, fully occupied by existing things, thus by bodies) entails that every place is occupied by (one or more) bodies (viz. [2]). It follows from (1) that there can be no void in any existing thing, i.e. in any body, and from (2) that no place can be empty, and so there can be no void in between bodies. (1) and (2) together yield (3), that there can be no void, which, we have seen entails the desired conclusion (4), that there can be no such thing as an atom. There remains the matter of the lack of anything to correspond to primum. It seems to me that this is not a serious objection. Immediately after the lines quoted in the previous paragraph, Cotta veers off into abuse of the atomic theory (ch. 66) and chides Velleius for his fanatic adherence to Epicureanism (ch. 67). He then goes on to his next point, that even if all things including the gods are composed of atoms, it follows from the principles of atomic theory that the gods are not eternal (concedam igitur ex individuis constare omnia; quid ad rem? deorum enim natura quaeritur. sint sane ex atomis; non igitur aeterni, chs. 67-8).5 This kind of move is characteristic of Cotta's refutation. He begins (ch. 65) by arguing that atoms do not exist - which is of course fatal to the Epicurean conception of the gods. He then (ch. 68) shows that even if atoms did exist an equally fatal problem would arise: the gods would not be eternal. The Epicureans met this objection by saying that the gods do not have bodies and blood (which are subject to perishing), but have quasi-bodies and quasi-blood (which somehow are not). Cotta argues that this is an unjustified dodge and an incompre hensible claim (chs. 69-75), and then proceeds to say that even if the claim were true, still further objections can be raised to their views (chs. 75-6). He next attacks the Epicurean conception of anthropomorphic gods (chs. 76-102), and then grants for the sake of argument that they have human appearance in order to challenge Epicu rean opinions on where the gods reside, how they live their lives, and in what their happiness consists (chs. 103-14). It thus turns out that the rejection of the atomic theory is the first (primum) of a series of claims (each of which is supported by a separate argument), any of which by itself controverts Epicurean theology, and which cumulatively show that the Epicurean view of the gods is objectionable at many levels: those who disbelieve in the atomic theory should not accept it, since the atomic theory is in fact false; nor should those who believe in the atomic theory accept it, since that theory requires compounds to be without exception perishable; nor should even a person who believes in atomic compounds with eternal quasi-bodies (a befuddled idea, Cotta insists) accept the anthropomorphic view of the gods that the Epicureans espouse; and even someone who believes in anthropomorphic gods with eternal quasi-bodies made of atoms should admit that the idle life assigned to them by the Epicureans has no reasonable claim to be happy.

Algra (ed.), The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy (Cambridge, 1999), 395-8. 5 The long distance (three chapters) intervening between primum and this second point would be enough to excuse the absence of a correlative particle, especially since the material in chs. 66-7 digresses from the main line of thought.</page></plain_text>
