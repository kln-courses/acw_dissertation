Yet it is not only the paucity of material, but the very nature of the question, which makes a definite answer practically impossible. For it can always be argued that interest in questions such as God's unity, theodicy, and anthropomorphism might appear within any monotheistic system. Thus, although Islamic theology can often be shown to be strikingly similar to Christian theol- ogy of an earlier period, it is often easier to speak about parallels than about sources. 4 1 See, e.g., Michael A.

In a recently published article Sidney Griffith has isolated one such theme, namely, the discussion of the "unworthy incentives to religious faith." Since "no such argument seems to have been used by earlier Christian apologists," Griffith was able to conclude that the argument was "an original contribution to apologetics on the part of the anti- Muslim apologists of the first Abbassid century."5 The present article will attempt an analysis of the background of this argument, of the conditions of its emergence within the interreligious debate over prophetology, and of its early development in Arabic theol- ogy, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish. Among the standard components of comprehensive Kalam works one finds the discussion of prophecy, which figures as a prominent part of any summa theologica.6 Moreover, many entire works were dedicated solely and specifically to this question, usually bearing such titles as "signs of Prophecy" (A(lam al-nubuwwa), "Establishment of Pro- phecy" (Ithbat al-nubuwwa), and the like. What normally comes under these titles is twofold: (a) an attempt to prove the human need for a prophet, and (b) a list of arguments meant to support the claim of one particular prophet, and his superiority over other prophets.7 Contribu- tions to this theme in Arabic literature were made by authors from Wansbrough, The Sectarian Milieu (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978) 113-14. However, W. Madelung has recently argued that originally this Muslim debate was unre- lated to Christian theology, and has shown that at its origin the argument pivoted around the question of anthropomorphism (tashbih); see "The origins of the controversy con- cerning the creation of the Koran," in J. M. Barral, ed., Orientalia Hispanica Sive Studia F. M. Pareja Octogenario Dicata 1 (Leiden: Brill, 1974) 504-25. Now, the question remains whether this very antianthropomorphist concern was not in its turn influenced by the encounter with Christianity-since tashbih figures as one of the major faults Muslims find with Christianity; see, e.g., al-Balkh's al-radd cala al-nasard quoted by Ibn Zurca, in Paul Sbath, Vingt traites philosophiques et apologetiques d'auteurs arabes chretiens (Cairo: Friedrich, 1929) 52; al-Jahiz, al-radd (ala al-nasara, thalath rasa) il (ed. J. Finkel; Cairo: al-matbaca al-calafiyya, 1926) 25. In such a complex issue, however, no argument can be totally conclusive, and one's view of the topic must remain a matter of personal impres- sion. 5 Sidney H.

Among Muslims we find Mutazilites8 and Ash arite theologians,9 Sunnites and Ismacilis;'1 among the Christians, Melchites,11 Jacobites,12 and Nestorians13 dedicated works to this sub- ject; and Jewish theologians, both Rabbanites and Karaites, dealt with it in their writings.14 In comparison with the abundance of Arabic literature dealing with this question, the meager part alloted to it in pre-Islamic literature is indeed striking. Although the book of Deuteronomy explicitly defines the criteria by which a true prophet is to be distinguished from a false one,15 these criteria had not elicited more than a few occasional com- ments among either Jewish or Christian thinkers before the Islamic period. When Philo, for example, refers to the relevant biblical pas- sage, he sums up its content in a concise, matter-of-fact way, without any elaboration.16 Another biblical story, the miracles performed by Moses in Egypt and in the desert, later served Arabic writers as a favored piece of reference for their "signs of prophecy."17 But where a Muctazilite would analyze the characteristics of real miracles as opposed to those contrived by sleight of hand, Philo prefers to draw a colorful and vivid picture of the various afflictions that befell the Egyptians.18 Philo 8 From al-Jahiz (Kitab hujaj al-nubuwwa, Rasda il al-Jahiz [ed.

But Philo does not underline these elements, let alone iso- late or regroup them systematically.20 In the same biblical passage, describing the plagues in Egypt, the Christian Gregory of Nyssa saw only an allegorical representation of the virtuous soul's striving for perfection.21 When Arabic-speaking theologians, both Jews and Muslims, set out to establish the legitimacy of prophecy in general, the polemical edge of their writings is directed against the Barhhima,22 or else against the hel- lenizing philosophers, the Falasifa.23 Pre-Islamic Christian writers do not seem to have so much as heard of the "brahmans" in this context. Now the absence of these Barahima in pre-Islamic Christian literature is easy enough to explain.24 But, unlike the "Brahmans," representatives 19 See esp. Spec. leg. 6.50-51 (LCL 7. 39) and Vit.

On the other hand, the absence of the Barahima from later, post-Islamic Christian (and, in par- ticular, Christian Arabic) texts, remains puzzling. As a tentative explanation I would suggest that, although often incorporated in Muslim prophetology, the Barahima theme was still perceived as part of Muslim heresiography. Generally speaking, Christian writers showed little interest in Muslim heresiography; they turned to it mainly when it served their own polemical anti-Muslim purposes. The Barahima were of no use for the Chris- tians in their debate with Islam, and since the Christians already had their own traditional pattern for proving the idea of prophecy, they did not feel the need to change it by adding the Barahima.</page><page sequence="5">SARAH STROUMSA of Greek philosophy were readily available to the Church Fathers, and yet the fight against pagan philosophy hardly touches upon prophetol- ogy. To cite just one example: in his polemical treatise against Celsus, Origen does mention the role of miracles, and argues that, unlike the trickster, the true prophet is not lost in ecstasy.25 But this is clearly a marginal issue in his defense of Christianity against pagan philosophy. A plausible explanation of this phenomenon seems to be that from an early date in mainstream Christian theology Jesus was not con- sidered to be a prophet. Those who spoke of Jesus as "a righteous man" and a prophet were definitely in the minority, and their views were pushed aside by the predominant christology. Prophets were thus usually given a secondary role; they are those who announce the com- ing of Jesus;26 who are, in some respects, his figura;27 or even those who propagate his gospel.28 In any case, the signs that mark a true pro- phet had become the problem of bygone generations. This Christian attitude had its effect on the Jewish approach. The Christians readily admitted the prophecy of Moses, although they saw it as an outdated issue. Therefore, for contemporary Jews the encounter with Christianity did not require that they should dwell on the proofs of prophecy.29 With the rise of Islam the scene changed drastically. Since Muham- mad had claimed to be a prophet, and since this claim had been rejected by both Jews and Christians, the traits that distinguish a true prophet from a false one at once became a key issue. And although by the ninth century we find this topic elaborated by Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike, it is a safe assumption that in the first round it was Islam which had to come up with "proofs of prophecy," in response to Christian and Jewish incredulity. Already John of Damascus (d. 724) challenges the Muslims to substantiate Muhammad's claim to 25 Origen C. Cel. 7.3. The same argument was brought up against the Montanists by Eusebius (Hist. eccl. 5.16.7-9, referred to in TDNT s.v. 7rpoorirrp-, 861). On other early Christian references to true prophecy, or true religion, see Wolfson, "Veracity of Reli- gion," 604-5. 26 See, e.g., Origen C. Cel. 1.51ff; see also Dictionaire de Theologie Catholique s.v.

In the discussion, old "biblical" arguments were adduced together with new ones, which were shaped and reshaped in the course of the interreligious debate. The general frame of the discussion, as well as the particular "signs," seem, at first sight, to be one and the same for the three reli- gions. However, a closer look reveals characteristic components for every religion. I shall not draw up here a list of the "signs" that were alluded to;32 rather, in what follows I shall try to point out some of the above mentioned components and to analyze them. We shall begin at the beginning, which in this case means the Muslims. Among the earliest preserved works wholly dedicated to the "signs of prophecy" is Jahiz's Proofs of Prophecy (hujaj al-nubuwwa).33 In this text, Jahiz enumerates two categories of proofs: those belong- ing to sense experience ( iyan zahir) and those based on indisputable tradition (khabar qahir).34 Jahiz regards both these proofs as dependent upon the intellect ((aql).35 The "sense experience" in this context is, first of all, the miracle performed by the prophet.36 The "tradition" was understood as referring to the historical traditions about the prophet and his miracles and to the transmission of the revealed Book.37 Now for Muslims, of course, the revealed Book was also, in itself, a miracle. In fact, al-Jahiz goes to great length to show that the miraculous beauty of the Qur,an, which leaves humans unable to imitate it (ijCaz), 30 John of Damascus De haer. 101 in Saint John of Damascus: Writings (trans.

Gustav Flugel; reprinted Beirut, 1964) 162:15 (Bishr b. al-Mu,tamir); 177:3 (Abel Sahl al-nubakhtr); 259:15 (al-Kindr)-all from the ninth century. Of earlier books dedicated to this subject we have no knowledge. 32 For examples of various criteria of true prophecy and their place in the discussion, see George Vajda, "La proph6tologie de Dawlld ibn Marwan al-Raqqr al-Muqammis, theologien Juif arabophone du IXe si6cle," Journal Asiatique 265 (1977) 227-35. 33 See n. 8 above. 34 al-Jahiz, h.aj al-nubuwwa, 118:16. 35 Ibid., 118:17-22. 36 Ibid., 139:19ff., 143:5. 37 Wolfson remarks that when Sa(adya refers to tradition "he means knowledge based upon revelation as recorded in Scripture" (Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity and Islam [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1947] 62-63). 106</page><page sequence="7">SARAH STROUMSA is as good a miracle as any other.38 The apologetic, defensive vein of his words is unmistakable. It has been suggested that the doctrine of i(jaz al-qur an might be seen as an eventual outcome of the importance of Arabic grammar in early Islam.39 Admittedly, this doctrine could not have developed without the importance attached to the Qur,ln and to linguistics. But the transformation of this linguistic interest into a doctrine cannot be explained solely as an inner development, the result of a purely scho- larly interest. Rather, the incentive for the shift came from an external factor: the impact of the encounter with both Christians and Jews. Relying on the Deuteronomic criteria of true prophecy, Jews and Chris- tians had challenged the Muslims to adduce a miracle of some sort to buttress their claims, thus driving the latter to ascribe to the Qur,an a role "comparable to the role of the theory of evidentiary miracles in Christian apologetics."40 Moreover, another distinctly Islamic science must also be taken into consideration in this context. Besides the miraculous beauty of the Qur),n, Jahiz emphasizes the miraculous transmission of all traditions about Muhammad's prophecy. He sets out to prove that such unani- mous transmission cannot be mistaken, or result from purely natural circumstances.41 In this argument, Jahiz relies heavily on the criteria developed in (Ilm al-hadith.42 Elsewhere, Jlhiz quotes Wasil b. (atle, who had listed four ways through which truth can be reached: (1) a revealed book (kitab natiq);43 (2) a widely accepted tradition (khabar mujtama( calayhi); (3) intellectual argument (hujiat (aql); (4) the con- sensus of the people (jmac or ijma min al-umma).44 This schema is, in fact, "the quaternion Koran, Sunna, consensus, and qiyas, which comprises the recognized sources or principles (usil) of law in the 38al-Jahiz, htaj al-nubuwwa, 136:1-7, 11-14; 138:14-17; 141:20ff; 143:4ff. 39 Griffith, "Comparative Religion," 80. 40 Cf. ibid., and see idem, "cAmmar al-Basrfs Kitab al-Burhan: Christian Kalam in the First Abbasid Century," Le Museon 96 (1983) 165. In fact, al-Jahiz's epistle, which addresses itself at first broadly to many opposing reli- gious beliefs (see huajq al-nubuwwa, 119), eventually narrows its scope and concentrates on the vindication of Islam against Christianity (ibid., esp. 125:23-126:1; 128:19-23; 131:15ff.). On this literary technique see Tarif Khalidi, Islamic Historiography: The His- tories of Mascudi (Albany: SUNY Press, 1975) 22-23. 41 al-J1hiz, .hiaj al-nubuwwa, 129:22-130:5; 136:2-8, 11-12; 138:14-17. 42 See, e.g., ibid., 132:3-4: "ma naqalathu al-jamacat can al-jamgcat"; cf.

Van Ess has argued that the adoption of this schema by Mu(tazil- ite theologians is a late phenomenon (appearing around the mid-ninth century), the result of the mutakallimfn's succumbing to the stronger orthodoxy, and giving up their former rejection of traditions. Van Ess sees here a "shift in the polemical accent," in which "the Muctazilites, instead of attacking the muhaddithun, turn now ... against non- Muslims. 47 It is more plausible to see here two facets, very possibly contem- porary, of the same theological phenomenon, rather than two stages of a theological development. Again, evidence from the seventh and eighth centuries is too scarce, and usually comes from secondary sources. But we do know that the intellectual religious encounter with Christianity had started not in the ninth century, but much earlier. The spokesmen for Christianity did not wait politely until the Muctazilites and orthodox Muslims had settled their disagreements. Early Mu tazil- ites could not afford the luxury of dealing only with muhaddithun while ignoring ahl al-kitab, leaving the arduous task of refuting them to their heirs. Thus the same early mutakallimun may at one and the same time have opposed the proliferation of hadith, and yet applied to the scrutiny of religious criteria originally developed to check the 45 See Schacht, Origins, 134-35. The supposition that this list had its origin in a tradi- tionalist setting, from which it was passed over to Kalam (rather than the other way around) is established by the very nature of the criteria in the list. Three of the four cri- teria are of a nonintellectual character. It is, therefore, more plausible to see the origin of these three criteria in a traditionalist setting, than in the intellectually oriented early KalaOm This supposition is strengthened by another such list, in which the intellectual argument is absent altogether. Al-Darimf (al-radd (ala al-Jahmiyya [ed. Gosta Vitestam; Lund/Leiden: Gleerup, 1960] 93) mentions only a revealed book (kitab naiq), tradition (athar), and consensus (ijma(). 46 See above, nn. 34-37. 47 J.

Cook, "(Anan and Islam: The Origins of Karaite Scripturalism," Jerusalem Studies in Ara- bic and Islam (forthcoming). I wish to thank Professor Cook for making this paper avail- able to me before publication. For all we know, however, what the Muctazilites rejected was not the very idea of tradition (for they did accept ijmac, a concept which implies some nonscriptural source of knowledge). Their objections seem to have been limited to "traditions" in the sense of hadith, separate traditions about the Sunna of the prophet as a basis for legal judgment. Considering the profusion of spurious and contradictory hadiths, such a skeptical attitude is hardly surprising. 108</page><page sequence="9">SARAH STROUMSA authenticity of hadfth.8 It seems to me quite untenable to claim that the "truth" (al-haqq) which Wasil tries to achieve in his fourfold schema referred only to the veracity of hacdth49 Already for Wasil, in all probability, the "truth" this list endeavors to establish ultimately refers to the truth of one religion, over against the others. This analysis, and in particular the affinity of the "proofs of pro- phecy" with dllm al-hadith, corroborates the suggestion50 that it was the Muslims who had developed the disparate Jewish and Christian criteria of true prophecy into a crystallized system. Nevertheless, the Christians were quick to pick up the challenge. Already in the ninth century one finds a Christian version of this "Signs of Prophecy" complex, with a peculiar Christian twist. Like their Muslim contemporaries, the Christians built their religious apolo- gia on the evidence of scriptures, traditions, and intellectual reflection, referring often to miracles and to consensus. But in its Christian garb, this complex is not formulated as referring to the prophet and to the way in which his authenticity can be evaluated in his lifetime. Rather, Christian writers in Arabic usually assemble the criteria by which an unbiased observer should be able to judge whether the success and pro- pagation of an established religion is, in itself, a proof of its authenticity.51 One can discern here the old Christian reluctance to overemphasize the role of the prophet, 52 as well as a defensive note: the success of Islam results from this-worldly circumstances (al-asbab 48 The phenomenon is not uncommon; Muctazilites also use in their discussions with the mujbira arguments which according to their own testimony were hurled at the mu ta- zila by Manichaeans. The same practice is found also among Christians. See, e.g., K. Vollers, "Das Religionsgesprach von Jerusalem (um 800 D)," ZKG 24 (1908) 65, 11.7-13, 69, 11.10-14. 49 Cf. Van Ess, "L'autorite," 213. Other quotations of Wasil by Al-(askarf, which do refer specifically to hacdth, do so explicitly; see Awa, il, 134:8ff. 50 See above p. 105. 51 For a detailed description and analysis of this theme see Samir Khalil, "La libert6 re- ligieuse chez les th6ologiens arabes chr6tiens du 9e si6cle," Witness of Faith in Life and Worship (Tantur Yearbook, 1980-81; Jerusalem, 1982) 93-160; Griffith, "Comparative Religion," 63-87. 52 Sometimes the differences between Jesus and the prophets are clearly spelled out. See Vollers, "Religionsgesprach," 45-46, 61, and 64. 11.20-22 (where, for argument's sake, the monk includes Muhammad with all the prophets); I. A. Khalife and M.

Instead of positive "ways" to truth, it is thus on "negative attri- butes" that the Christian Arabs rely in the search for the true religion.55 In this line of argumentation, the events that take place after the prophet's death gain major importance. These events (i.e., the suc- cess of the religious campaign and the means by which this success is achieved) become the staple proof put forward by Christian Arabs. The Nestorian cAmmar al-Basrf even claims that a continuation of miracles in all generations would have constituted a compulsion (ijbar) that would have limited the free choice of humanity.56 What is implied in cAmmar's statement is that evidentiary miracles, although necessary in the establishment of a new religion, have a theoretical drawback. For him, intellectual reflection on history in later generations, can provide a religion with a proof of a higher value than miracles. For Muslims, on the contrary, the recourse to traditions from the prophet, after his death, is usually seen as a necessary technical device to bridge the time gap between the actual miracle and later generations. Thus, the supe- rior value of miracles is generally admitted on the Muslim side.57 At best, the postprophetic propagation of traditions is granted the role of an auxiliary miracle.58 It is thus the Christians who introduced into the discussion this set of "negative attributes" of the true religion.

See, e.g., Vollers, "Religionsgesprach," 62-63; (Ammar al-Basrf, Burhan, 36-38. 55 See the references in nn. 11-13 above. 56 cAmmar al-Bas r, Burhan, 27. 57 See, e.g., (Abd al-Jabbar, Mughni 15. 148:3: "Nothing but miracles is a proper proof for the sending of (divine) messengers"; the traditions are accepted as proofs for past events only (mndiyat), faute de mieux The same view, which technically relies only on traditions, but ultimately gives a theoretical preference to the miracle, was probably held by (Abbad b.

Against the Muslim emphasis on the mar- velous nature of the Qur an's Arabic, Christians repeatedly emphasize the multilingual spread of the Gospels.61 This is for them an additional proof of the divinely sponsored propagation of Christianity, as well as an argument against the possible fabrication through conspiracy (tawatr) ) or falsification (tahrif) of the Bible. Another important Christian development concerns the role of the intellect. cAmmar al-Basrf opens his discussion by paying his tribute to the twin proof of miracles (ayat) and an intellectually tested proof (dalalat caql).62 Immediately thereafter he sets out to strip this "intel- lect" of its important role. For him, intellectual judgment refers not to reflection upon the content of religious teaching, but, again, to its spreading. 63 (Ammar is anxious to emphasize that the logical content, however appealing, of a given religion (istihsan) has no bearing on the question of its authenticity. 64 On the contrary, only a religion which is widely accepted in spite of its abhorrent illogical claims can be the true one.65 On several occasions cAmmar argues that knowledge of God does not come naturally to human beings. It is not inherent to their constitution, it is not part of their instinctive, inborn knowledge, and since it is also not part of their sense experience, only revelation can give them the right knowledge of God.66 If we consider the long Christian tradition of "natural knowledge of God,"67 the prevailing contemporary muctazilite belief in inborn reli- giosity (fitra),68 and also cAmmar's overall intellectual inclination, then 60 The development of the Christian version out of the Muslim one can be witnessed in al-Muqammis's version of this theme; see below, pp. 112-13. 61 See cAmmar al-Basrf, Burhan, 32, 41, 72; idem, Masa il, 141; Abu Qurra, "maymar fr tahqfq al-Injil," Mayamir ThaudEtras Abi Qurra (ed.

Al-Baqilanf sees this argument as typical of Jews and Christians (Kitab al-tamhid [ed. R. J.

It would seem that this position was meant to enable him to respond to Muslim and Jewish attacks on what was regarded as the illogical Christian doctrine of the Divinity.69 A Jewish contemporary of cAmmar and of al-Jahiz, Dawud b. Marwan al-Raqqf al-Muqammis, allows us a glimpse into the intricacy of the debate between religions. His "twenty chapters" (WIshrun Maqala) is the earliest surviving work of Jewish theology in Arabic.70 Chapter fourteen of Icshrun Maqala deals with the "signs of prophecy," referring constantly to the biblical passages concerning Moses' miracles.71 Technically, however, this chapter is presented as concerned with the ways of verifying a tradition (Khabar) about a prophet after his death. As we have seen, this preference for miracles, comple- mented by a resigned reliance on traditions for the use of later genera- tions, has its equivalent-and probable origin-in Muslim argumentation.72 Another component of al-Muqammis's prophetology, similar to Muslim conceptions, is the demand for logical content (al- sahih fi al-qiyas) in the prophecy. Al-Muqammis explicitly interprets this condition as excluding Christianity, together with other false reli- gions. However, some of the other "signs of prophecy" listed by al- Muqammis point to a different direction. He insists that the tradition about the prophet's first victory over his enemies should recount a vic- tory miraculously achieved, rather than a military one ("la bi-harb wa- la bi-sayf"). This demand is clearly intended to play down Islam and its success. He also asks that the tradition (which, in this case, is ident- ical with the revealed book) be transmitted by several nations in many Vrin, 1970) 350; D. B. MacDonald, s.v. fitra, EI2 2. 932 and cf. Griffith, "Comparative Religion," 80. 69 This doctrine is understood to contain both the trinitarian and the christological aspects of Christian theology. See, e.g., al-Jahiz, hujaj, 131:19-132:7. We have no indi- cation that cAmmar was already aware of the "intellectual," "anti-prophecy" Barahima. However, if he was, this position would have the additional benefit of avoiding the "Barahima-catch": for, if it is openly stated that the human intellect is not the proper vehicle for religious knowledge, the Ilzam used by the Barahima becomes void. 70 For biographical outline, see George Vajda, "La finalite de la cr&amp;ation de l'homme selon un th6ologien juif du IXe siecle," Oriens 15 (1962) 61-85. For the text and analysis of Icshran Maqala, see my "Dawfd ibn Marwan al-Muqammis and his Ilshrmn Maqala (in Hebrew; Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1983). 71 The first lines of this chapter are, unfortunately, missing in the only extant manuscript. A French summary and partial paraphrase of chap. 14 was published by Vajda (see n. 32 above). 72 See above, n. 57. 112</page><page sequence="13">SARAH STROUMSA languages ("wa-la min umma wiahida wa-lisan wahid"), a typical Chris- tian requirement.73 (Al-Muqammis conveniently ignores the reference to tribal or familial links- asabiyya--which Christians directed also against Judaism.)74 Altogether, al-Muqammis lists ten characteristics of the authentic tradition about the true prophet, all of them presented in the form of quotations from some unidentified book ("and as to his saying" ... "wa-amma qawluhu"). Now we know that al-Muqammis had received his education from Christians, and was familiar with their writings;75 and we can be fairly confident that it is some early Christian list of the "signs of prophecy" that he quotes.76 It is noteworthy that this early Christian work also incorporated some elements of Muslim prophetol- ogy. Like its Muslim models, this Christian list is specifically intended to evaluate a prophet, not a religion ("and the tradition about him should relate"-"wa-an yakuna fi khabarihi"). However, it also includes some of the negative characteristics of the true religion, typical of Christian texts. Unexpected as it may seem, it is thus a Jewish text which enables us actually to see how the Christians turned the Muslim "signs of prohecy" theme into their own "negative description" of the true religion. The attempt made above to isolate typical Christian or Muslim argu- ments is a reconstruction of the earliest encounters, for which we have no reliable records. All we can do is to discern arguments that were favored by a given religion, or that fit best into the framework of a par- ticular prophetology. But we should also bear in mind that the argu- 73 See n. 61 above. For later, more sensitive adaptations of the Christian argument in Jewish texts, see Sarah Stroumsa, "Jewish-Muslim and Jewish-Christian Polemics in Light of the Judaeo-Arabic Texts," in Norman Golb, ed., Proceedings of the First Confer- ence on Judaeo-Arabic (Chicago, May 1984), forthcoming. 74 See, e.g., (Ammar al-Bas rf, Burhan, 31. 75 Al-Qiriqisanf, Anwar, 1. 44:10-16. According to Qirqisanf, al-Muqammis had actu- ally converted to Christianity. His (Ishrun Maqala, however, was clearly written after his return to Judaism. 76 A Muslim source is excluded by the above mentioned antimilitary remark. The pos- sibility of a Jewish source, earlier than al-Muqammis and yet so well structured, is improbable. The reference to the transmission of scriptures by "many nations" renders the possibility of a Jewish source even more unlikely. The "source" enumerates only the conditions; it is clearly al-Muqammis who applies the conditions to Moses, and thus adapts the general frame provided by his source to Jewish theology. Moreover, the Christian identity of al-Muqammis's source is apparent also in his use of "covenant" (chd) to designate the revealed book. See J. Schach, El2 s.v. (Ahd, 1. 255. 113</page><page sequence="14">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ments and "signs" introduced by Muslims directly influenced those used by Christians; and vice versa. Thus, the eleventh-century muctazilite master (Abd al-Jabbar goes out of his way to demonstrate that Muhammad's victories were indeed miraculous, and not at all military; that Muhammad came from a hum- ble family and that, consequently, it was not for earthly gains that his followers joined him; that his rejection by his tribe invalidates the accu- sation of tashacub; and even that Muhammad's message spread in all languages.77 Together, these contentions put forward an uncommonly Christian, "Jesus-like" portrait of Muhammad's prophecy. It appears that here again we can capture one moment in the process of the interreligious debate in which each side helped to shape and remodel the theological edifice of the other. Muhammad's claim for prophecy triggered a Jewish and Christian attack on his prophetic qualifications, which forced the Muslims to establish a system of vindi- cation of Muhammad's prophecy. The existence of this system obliged the Christians to respond with "the (negative) signs of a true religion," their own version of the "signs of prophecy"; this response in its turn influenced later Muslim depiction of Muhammad and of early Islamic history.78 77 cAbd al-Jabbar, Tathbt, 8:16-17, 24:4-5; idem, Mughni 16. 21:13-14, 27:5-6. Although some of these elements appear already in Jahiz's hujaj al-nubuwwa, Qad.f stands out in his consistent depiction of the meekness of the Prophet. 78 1 wish to thank Professor Sidney H.
