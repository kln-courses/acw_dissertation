Hoernlé attempts to delimit and to define the concept "primitive peoples19. Every specialist knows how significant it is for anthropology that there should be a dear comprehension of this concept. Hoernlé is, however, mistaken in supposing that there are no useful discussions available about this subject. He does not seem to be suf- ficiently acquainted with the German literature, although in German ethnology the proper meaning of the concept "primitive" has long been established. It must be admitted, though, that there is in English and French great difficulty - that these languages employ only the expressions "primitive peopled and "civilised people", which lead us nowhere. They do not permit of the division into "Naturvölker" (nature peoples) and "Kulturvölker" (culture peoples), which is fundamental for German ethnology, with the result that "primitive" is used for the former, and "civilised" for the latter. Let us first look at Hoernlé's discussion. According to him, the civilised peoples are the Europeans and the Americans, opposed to whom stand the primitive peoples. The word "primitive" however, has in no way a chronological, but rather a qualitative, connotation. With this one may very well agree. The distinction between primitive and civilised can be seen from three aspects, (a) in material standard of life, (b) in the social organisation (and here Hoernlé recalls Morgan's distinction between s o c i e t a s and c i v i t a s, and (c) in the anthropomorphic, animistic conception of Nature or the world. This third aspect is to him the most important in deciding whether a people is primitive or civilised. He carries the point further by saying that the ex- pression "primitive" rules out the presence of science, i. e. of a scientific conception of Nature, and that it retains to a much greater extent the belief that natural phenomena and objects are activated by spirits and spiritual forces, and so on. It would seem that Hoernlé, if I understand him rightly, implies thereby that a scientific conception of the world is civilised, while a spiritualistic conception is primitive. With such a di- stinction, however, scarcely any anthropologist could agree. No one would, for instance, include the ancient Egyptians among the "primitive peoples", and yet they were far from having a scientific conception of Nature. But they were also not a civilisation in the modern sense. In English and French there is no precise expression by which one can indicate this level of culture, although this is possible in German. We see, therefore, that the division inio primitive and civilised is not adequate. On the principle involved the following brief remarks about the subject should be made. We must distinguish chiefly between "Naturvölker" and "Kulturvölker", who are separated from each other by a clear, well-defined line of division, namely, writing. Peoples without the art of writing are "Naturvölker". We can then regard as civilised those "Kulturvölker" who have acquired the features of modern science and technology. Again, we must distinguish from the "Naturvölker" the "primitive peoples". Here also the line of division is dearcut and obvious. "Primitive peoples" are those who do not know how to derive the means of subsistence from the soil in an artificial manner, i. e. those who have no agriculture, but support themselves only by collecting wild fruits and roots. Any people, however, which already practises some form of cultivating the soil, even if it be only a miserable hoe-culture, can no longer be classed among "primitive peoples". This division into "primitive peoples", "Naturvölker" and "Kulturvölker" is eminently practical and also easy to apply. It has no chronological implications, but only something qualitative, which is what Hoernlé requires. That the factor of "spiritualistic conception" can be no criterion for the division of peoples and individuals into "primitive" and "civilised" can easily be seen from the</page><page sequence="2">Analecta et Additamenta. 68£ fact that this conception is found among "primitive peoples", among "Naturvölker" ancT 'among "Kulturvölker", differing gradually in intensity, it is true, but none the less present. In any case a scientific conception of the world can quite easily be combined with a spiritualistic. P. P. ScHEBESTA, S. V. D.</page></plain_text>
