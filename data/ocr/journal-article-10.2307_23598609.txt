<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES THE LAW OF SIN-OFFERING OF THE 'HOLINESS SCHOOL' by Israel Knohl The law of sin-offering in Leviticus 4:14 determines that the case of an inadvertant collective sin one bull should be sacrificed as a sin-offering. However, the parallel law in Numbers 15:24 indicates that in such a case a bull must be sacrificed as a burnt-offering and a he-goat as a sin-offering. Many have attempted to explain this apparent contradiction. The present writer examines the solution recently put forward by A. Tweig (Tarbiz 43 [1974], pp. 1-20) and reaches the conclusion that it is unacceptable. The writer considers that the contradiction can be explained if we accept that the two laws originated in differing priestly traditions: The law in Leviticus 4 originated from the 'Priestly Tora' (P), while the law in Numbers 15 originated in the 'Holiness School' (H). The difference in the ritual precribed in the two laws reflects the ideological divergence between these two schools and their dissimilar attitude to the popular cult tradition. In the popular cult, the burnt-offering is thought to be a means of pleasing God, because of the pleasant odour emanating from the offering, which has the power of placating the divine wrath. The 'Priestly Tora' had reservations from the anthropomorphic image of God being appeased by the pleasantness of the sacrifice. This school therefore removed the burnt-offering from its status as the principal sacrifice of atonement and prefered the impersonal sprinkling of the blood of the sin-offering. The 'Holiness School', which is the later of the two Priestly schools, reflects a turning-point in priestly thought. According to this school, the popular cult tradition had to be incorporated within the priestly type of ritual. This school therefore postulated that in the case of a collective error a bull must be dacrified as a burnt-offering, according to the popular cult, as well as a he-goat for a sin offering to accord with priestly ritual. THE HISTORY OF HALAKHA AND THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON MIQSAT MA'ASE HA-TORAH (4QMMT) by Yaakov Sussmann At a symposium, sponsored by the Hebrew University (June 1987) to mark the fortieth anniversary of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, an attempt was made to assess the significance of the Scrolls for our understanding of the history of early Halakha, and to illuminate the contribution of the Qumran writings on Talmudic literature and vice versa, The lecture is presented here literally, with</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES additional discussion provided in the notes. The main themes discussed were as follows: 1. A brief survey of research of early Halakha since the beginnings of Wissenschaft des Judentums in the 19th century, through Schechter's publication of the Zadokite Fragments (CD) in 1910, culminating with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and up to the present. Unfortunately, this extremely important area of research has suffered considerable neglect, particularly (and paradoxically!) since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. 2. An account of the Qumran sect's approach to Fialakha follows, based primarily on the crucially important 4QMMT scroll, due to be published by Professors J. Strugnell of Harvard University and E. Qimron of Ben Gurion University (Beer Sheba). Comparison of the DS Scroll's halakhic rulings with the halakhic traditions preserved in rabbinic literature reveals that the halakha of 4QMMT is clearly anti-Pharisaic and most probably Sadducean. This Halakha, in contrast to Pharisaic Halakha, is stringent, uncompromising and harshly formalistic. 3. An examination of the relative position of the Qumran community in the spectrum of Second Temple period sects, from the halakhic standpoint, as reflected in rabbinic ideology and talmudic literature. An attempt is made to reconcile the generally accepted view, that the members of the Qumran sect were Essenes (as demonstrated by their spiritual and social orientation), with the assumption that the sect's religious code was Sadducean. It is suggested that the Essenes (who may well be the Bet Sin [Boethusians] mentioned in rabbinic literature) followed a Sadducean halakhic tradition. This sect was thus engaged in a dual struggle: an ethical, social and theological conflict with the Sadducees ('Manasseh' in their writings), and a halakhic and theological conflict with the Pharisees ('Ephraim'). 4. Following the previous conclusions, a general characterization of the major 'parties' of late Second Temple Judaism is presented. All of these groups assigned a central role to strict religious observance. The two largest groups, the Sadducees and the Pharisees, represent the two main streams of ancient Judaism, whose roots apparently go back to the (late?) biblical period: the priestly group, which insisted on strict observance of the Law, considered the Temple ritual as the pivot of religious life and adhered zealously to the strict observance of the cult; and the more flexible party, which sought to spread religious observance among the widest possible circles and in every day life. Somewhere between these two main groups stood the small, pietistic, zealous Qumran sect (Essenes/Boethusians [?]), which adhered to the priestly, Sadducean Halakha, albeit on different spiritual and ideological grounds. DID THE PRIESTLY COURSES (MISHMAROT) TRANSFER FROM JUDAEA TO GALILEE AFTER THE BAR KOKHBA REVOLT? by Dalia Trifon The article examines a list of the priestly courses (Mishmarot) and their places of settlement in Galilee. It is generally considered that the list is based on a baraita dating from after the Bar Kokhba revolt and is evidence of a transfer of the kohanim from Judaea to Galilee after the rebellions. The main question is whether the roster reflects a historical situation regarding the settlement of the kohanim according to their courses in the places mentioned in it, and if so, what is the earliest time that this settlement took place? Examination of the sources shows that the list cannot be dated earlier than the middle of the third century. The list shows that the kohanim who lived in the places referred to associated themselves, or</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES III were associated by others, with one of the courses, but there is no proof whatsoever that there was an organized settlement of kohanim by their courses in the Galilee. The theory that courses moved from Judaea to Galilee following the destruction of the Second Temple and the Bar Kokhba revolt has nothing to support it. On the contrary, there is evidence of an increased presence of the kohanim in Galilee just from the middle of the third century on. This agrees with the archaeological findings that show a general increase in the Jewish population of the Galilee in the third and fourth centuries, apparently in consequence of Jewish immigration from the diaspora into the country. NEW POEMS OF R. SAMUEL HA-NAGID by Shulamit Elizur The Genizah treasures of Leningrad have recently yielded a fragment from the poetic works of R. Samuel Ha־Nagid, a fragment discovered and identified by the late researcher L. Wilsker. This contains twenty short poems of the great poet, eleven of which were previously unknown. The transcription of these newly discovered poems is preceded by an introduction, which examines the dated colophon found at the end of the poems, and discusses the pertinence of this fragment to the research concerning the editions of Samuel Ha-Nagid's poetry. PERSPECTIVES OF COMPARATIVE RESEARCH OF FOLK NARRATIVES IN AGGADIC MIDRASHIM — ENIGMATIC TALES IN LAMENTATIONS RABBA, I Galii Hasan-Roküm Aggadic midrashim are richly interwoven with folk narrative materials. Comparative methods of folklore research have traditionally been applied to the analysis of narratives in midrashic texts to demonstrate the connections and reciprocal influences between Hebrew literature and other cognate, or otherwise relevant, folk literatures. The present article continues this scholarly tradition with some innovation. The comparison is informed by a wide perspective that views cultural discourses as an ongoing interaction in which historical and existential experiences are transmitted in narrative forms. In chapter I of Lamentations Rabba the chain of enigmatic tales conveys tones and messages formed by a distinctive culture and literary context, generally different from those in related traditions found in Greek, Arabic and Indian sources. However, in some Arabic versions the city of Najaran appears as a locus actionis parallelling Jerusalem in the Lamentations Rabba versions, reciting the destruction of Najaran by the Jewish king of the Himyarites. Such Arabic sources, both pre-Islamic and Islamic, are therefore relevant to a discussion of the association with the theme of the destruction of a beloved city in Lamentations Rabba and the specific enigmatic tales. Rather than merely comparing motifs the present approach is an attempt to treat this genre more comprehensively in its capacity to serve as a powerful means of shaping images of historical</page><page sequence="4">IV SUMMARIES consciousness. The midrashic tales are therefore been considered on two levels: first as dynamic folk narrative units, readily transmitted to various contexts, and second, dialectically, as organic elements of Lamentations Rabb«, transmitting some of its general meanings associated with loss and destruction, even when introduced into other traditions. Hence the midrashic narratives of destruction are interlaced with figures of Arabs and recognizably Arabic motifs. An analysis of some Arabic and Jewish folk traditions relating the enigmatic tales, both literary and oral, demonstrates that the cultural interaction continued. Thus these tales were well known in Jewish folk tradition in Arab countries although rarely elsewhere among Jews. Tracing later stages of cultural interaction embodied in the chain of enigmatic tales from Lamentations Rabba reveals, however, that its most exact parallel, in the combination of tales and motifs, be it in Jewish or non-Jewish sources, appears in an Italian Baroque collection entitled 'The Journey of the three Sons of the King of Serendippo' or 'The Journey of the Sons of Jaffer'. A direct or indirect influence of the midrashic text on this collection, well known in European literature and revealed in folk narrative research, may therefore be assumed. PHILOSOPHICAL HERMENEUTICS ON THE SONG OF SONGS, INTRODUCTORY REMARKS by Shalom Rosenberg When we study the Jewish exegetical works on the Canticles, we can define four different types of commentaries: 1) the peshat commentaries that expound the plain and literal meaning, 2) the derash of the Talmudic sages, that reads the text as a dialogue between the Almighty and the Jewish People as a collective entity, 3) the philosophical sod according to which the book is read as a dialoge with the individual human soul, 4) the cabbalistic sod that reads in the book the description of the relations between the Divine sephirot. This article deals with the history of the third type of exegesis, i.e. philosophical commentaries even if they are included in texts that belong to other traditions. These are individulistic and psychological interpretations, guided by the basic intuition that the Song of Songs describes the relationship of human soul with the Almighty. The history of the philosophical exegesiss of this book parallels the history of the theory of devekul, the Conjunction or Union between the human soul and the Divine realm. RABBI JOSEPH KARO: BETWEEN SPAIN AND GERMANY by Israel M. Ta-Shma The article scrutinizes some sociological aspects of Rabbi Joseph Karo's two books: Beit Yosef and Shulchan Aruch. The main halakhic principles behind the books are clearly Spanish, but the many halakhic details and customs which do not derive from the Talmud, but from medieval rabbinic literature and tradition, and which fill the books to the point of overflowing, represent mainly Ashkenazi material, thus serving to keep a very fine balance between the two major schools. One could conveniently say, that the two books are 'Spanish' qualitatively, and 'Ashkenazi' —</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES quantitatively. This facilitated or, rather, paved the way, for their acceptance by both communities, and helped significantly to fulfill Karo's deep aspiration, expressed many times in his Magid Mesharim, to become the halakhic head of the Jewish nation at large. It is suggested that the inclusion of an impressive layer of Kabbalistic lore in these purely legal books, especially from the Zohar — the first time in the long history of rabbinic literature that such a step has been taken — indicates, apart from Karo's deep personal involvement in mysticism and his acceptance of the authority of the Zohar, a squint towards the large Romaniot community of Byzantium and outside it. Proof is adduced to the surprising fact, that only in Byzantium was the Zohar known to, and accepted by, normative halakhists, as by the educated part of the laity. NEW LIGHT ON THE DATING AND PROVENANCE OF KOL SAKHAL AND ITS TIMELESS CRITIQUE OF RABBINIC CULTURE by Talya Fishman Scholarship pertaining to Kol Sakhal, a pseudonymous critique of rabbinic authority and tradition, has been virtually monopolized by the question whether the treatise was composed by the colourful Venetian rabbi, Leone Modena (1571-1648). Researchers who identified Modena as the author based their claims on observed similarities between passages in Kol Sakhal and in Modena's acknowledged writings. Others, rejecting the theory of Modena's authorship, emphasized the incongruity of imputing a heterodox work to a community leader who was deeply involved in defending rabbinic authority against attacks by conversos returning to the Jewish fold. Neither category attempted to identify the geographical or chronological origins of the text by drawing upon internal and philological evidence. Analysis of Kol Sakhal against the backdrop of literature known to mediaeval Jews until 1500, the alleged date of its composition, yields certain clues about its provenance. The description of a Jewish community composed of Ashkenazim, Sephardim and Italians living side by side suggests northern Italy as one of two possible places of composition, and the only one within the Christian milieu. The contrast between the author's obvious familiarity with and impassioned references to elements of Christian theology and hermeneutics, and his single, confused reference to Islam points to northern Italy as the place of composition. Certain practices referred to in Kol Sakhal are unique to Ashkenazi or lo'azi, i.e., Italian, Jewish tradition, among them the powg side by side suggests northern Italy as one of two possible places of composition, and the only one within the Christian milieu. The contrast between the author's obvious familiarity with and impassioned references to elements of Christian theology and hermeneutics, and his single, confused reference to Islam points to northern Italy as the place of composition. Certain practices referred to in Kol Sakhal are unique to Ashkenazi or lo'azi, i.e., Italian, Jewish tradition, among them the power of the rabbis to compel a reluctant levir to 'release' his widowed sister-in-law from marriage by performing the haliza ceremony, and the adoption of practices of 'affliction' from the 17th of Tammuz, not merely from the first of Av. One practice alluded to in the treatise is found exclusively in Italian Jewish sources, namely, the performance of kapparot with chickens on the eve of Rosh Ha-Shana. The phrase, be-arba'a millot, literally 'in four words', an idiom signifying 'in brief, is probably a caique from Italian, appearing, e.g., in sixteenth-century documents of the Inquisition in Friuli.</page><page sequence="6">VI SUMMARIES Other internal textual evidence yields clues about Kol Sakhal's date of composition. A reference to the permissibility of lending money with interest in some nations seems to indicate that the treatise was written after the Reformation's revisionist exegesis of Deuteronomy 23 had transformed the fiscal policies of particular regions, i.e., after 1500. Analysis of two other passages in Kol Sakhal, one pertaining to the superstition that marriages should take place at the full moon, and the other describing features of the kiddush levana ceremony, suggests that the author was reacting to specific textual formulations found in the Shulhan Arukh with the glosses of theMappah — an edition first published in 1569-1571 — rather than to any earlier rabbinic sources. Finally, Kol Sakhal's use of the term Gavlanim to denote a sect of the Second-Temple period would seem to indicate that the author was familiar with the work where that neologism first occurs, Azariah dei Rossi's Meor Einayim, published between 1573 and 1575. The last quarter of the sixteenth century must therefore be taken as the terminus quo ante for the composition of Kot Sakha!, while 1622 or 1624, the years in which Modena reports having respectively received the manuscript and written his refutation of it, would constitute the treatise's terminus ad quern. This evidence thus gives new credibility to the assumption made by Kol Sakhal's earliest researchers that the text was written in the time and environment of Leone Modena. With hindsight, it validates their search for and identification of similarities between passages in Kol SakhaI and in Modena's acknowleged writings. Nonetheless, the appropriation by the author of criticisms of rabbinic culture found in many genres of mediaeval Jewish writing does much to obscure his time, place and identity. It is precisely this feature which contributes to the reader's perception of Kol Sakha! as a timeless critique of rabbinic tradition. THE MUSAR MOVEMENT AND THE ISSUE OF HERMENEUTICS IN THE STUDY OF TORAH by Tamar Ross The issue of hermeneutics appears in uniquely Jewish garb in the discourses of the leaders of the Musar movement. The specific question with which they grapple is how to overcome the distortions of personal bias in the study of Torah while avoiding the opposite hazards posed by academic detachment. Although all the Musar teachers use the traditionalist solution as a starting point, within this approach they develop three variations. These sub-approaches parallel the three options mooted in general hermeneutic theory, i.e. 1) historic; 2) experiential; 3) traditionalist. While the first two approaches are objectivist in the belief that there is a fixed interpretation waiting to be revealed, the third attaches a much more flexible and creative function to the reading of texts. In secular terms, this approach is related to the philosophy of 'world-making'. In Jewish religious terms, it is related to the idea of the partnership that exists between man and God in establishing the nature of Torah and even reality itself.</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES VII THE OLD MAN OF JAFFA — MORITZ HALL by Avraham Holtz 1fe Toby Berger Holtz Among the many realistic details in S. Y. Agnon's documentary novel Tmol Shilshom is a lengthy passage (pp. 67-68) recounting the biography of an 'old man of Jaffa'. This figure Issaac Kumer, the novel's protagonist, in the well-known 'Baron's Garden', where he offers Isaac his first job in Eretz Yisrael and employs him as a painter. We have identified this 'old man'as Moritz Hall (1838-1914), an elderly resident of the German colony of Jaffa at the time of this novel, the beginning of the twentieth century. In the novel, Hall is described as a Polish Jew who went to Germany and England, converted to Christianity, and travelled as a missionary to Ethiopia, where he became a member of the royal court. Later on, he moved to Jaffa, and gave his daughters in marriage to members of the nobility. According to the narrator, although he remained an apostate, the 'old man' was known for his friendliness and kindness to the Jewish inhabitants. We have found external sources documenting most of Agnon's details concerning Moritz Hall, and indeed, we have uncovered other relevant facts that fill in the author's description. Thus, for example, in Ethiopia, Hall built and supervised a cannon foundry for the Emperor Theodore. When he came to Eretz Yisrael, Hall was for a while the manager of the missionary colony at Artouf, the present Hartuv. In Jaffa, Hall's eldest daughter Magdalena married the Russian emigre Baron Platon von Ustinov. Agnon refers to him in this novel and in other works about Jaffa as the 'old baron', the owner of the famous garden in Jaffa. The close reading and intensive examination of the details of this passage illustrate a method that, when applied to the entire work, substantiates our classification of this novel as documentary fiction. In it the minutest details often reflect historical reality as the author may have experienced it, or later reconstructed it for his readers, based on contemporary primary and secondary sources. NOTE: A DIFFICULT READING IN S1FREI DEUTERONOMY by Harry Fox The author considers the difficult reading in MS Vatican of Sifre רודה את שורו a corruption. The original reading רודין Deut. Pisqa47 is maintained in the newly discovered Yemenite MS Cincinnati. Its meaning — a possible messianic allusion — is discussed. NOTE: ON M. KAHANA'S ARTICLE (TARBIZ LIV, pp. 485-552) by Herbert Zvi Basser Menahem Kahana has published fragments in Tarbiz (LIV, pp. 485-552) identified asMekhilta texts. He describes a number of passages in these texts as substantially different from Sifre and claims that</page><page sequence="8">VIII SUMMARIES his Mekhilta provides the original Rabbinic midrash on Deuteronomy while Sifre is a later and less reliable witness. In so doing, he has found it necessary to dismiss the present author's interpretation of how Sifre deals with Deuteronomy 32:39. The author defends his interpretation by demonstrating that the Mekhilta version of Kahana, in this passage, is actually based on Sifre (not without a gross misunderstanding of Sifre which leads to the creation of unintelligible hybrids). Namely, in the Mekhilta two separate and conflicting Sifre traditions concerning the understanding of Deut. 32:39 are forged together into one tradition which defies explanation. Mekhilta's modified form retains details of the original Sifre text which do not fit the reworking. Kahana reads the confused Mekhilta text back into Sifre and so is guilty of the very confusions of which he has mistakely accused the author. It is hoped that this correction will stimulate further investigation of the important texts Kahana has recently published. NOTES TO THE MEKHILTA by Menahem Kahana The article contains supplementary notes to the passages in the Mekhilta and Sifre Deuteronomy published by the author in preceding numbers of Tarbiz (54 [ 1985], pp. 485-551; 56 [1987], pp. 19-59; 57 [1988], pp. 165-191). 1. A response to the criticism of H. Fox on the subject of רודה את שורו, includes a methodological discussion on the redaction of the texts. 2. A survey of new textual witnesses to passages of the Sifre, corresponding to the passages of the Mekhilta which have been published. These support the thesis that the divergences in the two midrashic works stem from differences in redaction and not from errors in transmission. 3. A discussion of the term 'Mishna' as found in Sifre Deuteronomy and other midrashim from the school of R. Aqiva in contrast to the corresponding passages in Mekhilta Deuteronomy and additional midrashim from the school of R. Ishmael, where the term 'Mishna' is not mentioned. It is suggested that this reflects the differing attitudes of the editors of the Tannaitic midrashim to the Mishna of R. Judah Ha-Nasi and its authority. 4. Supplementary notes on a number of talmudic hapax legomena discussed in earlier articles: .שמחה־אור ;אחד־אחת ;דיין=דין;או=ו THE TERMS NABUHA AND VAHI IN MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED by Abraham Nuriel Nabuha and Vahi are two terms appearing in Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed in connection with his discussion of the theory of prorhecy. Vahi means some verbal revelation, that may (or may not) be followed by Nabuha, that is transmitting the contents of the Vahi to someone else. Delivering to others a prophecy that was not recieved by Vahi constitutes false prophecy, the one exception to this rule being Moses, who could verily prophesy to anyone, without having recieved a Vahi.</page></plain_text>
