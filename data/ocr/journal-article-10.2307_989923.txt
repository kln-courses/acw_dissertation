<plain_text><page sequence="1">Houses Are Human: Architectural Self-images of Africa's Tamberma* SUZANNE PRESTON BLIER Columbia University ... there is no question but that architectural members reflect the mem- bers of Man and that those who do not know the human body cannot be good architects. Michelangelo Buonarroti, 15601 Anthropomorphism is a central feature of the architecture of the Tam- berma, a Voltaic people of Africa's western savanna. In a variety of ways, the Tamberma suggest that their houses are human, that they represent men and women. Like humans, each house is said to be made from flesh, bones, and blood (earth, pebbles, and water). Many parts of the house also are given distinctively human names and identities (head, eyes, lips, tongue, nose, ear, stomach, bile, penis, etc.). Forms of architectural decoration, and types of symbolic behavior directed to- wards the house (greeting the house, drinking with the house, shooting the house,feeding the house), are also drawn from human models. This essay explores the multiple human dimensions of these buildings. It discusses the manner in which architecture, by defining the human, helps to clarify Tamberma psychology, and how, through this model, it serves as a central symbol and structuring device in Tamberma psy- chological and therapeutic processes. The Human House ANTHROPOMORPHISM IS, in many respects, one of architec- ture's universals. In the West, discussions of architectural an- thropomorphism go back to those of Vitruvius, Alberti, Mi- chelangelo, and Palladio.2 More recently, the subject of human imagery in architecture has been taken up by scholars, architects, and theorists as diverse as Geoffrey Scott, Le Corbusier, Nicholas Pevsner, Steen Rasmussen, Roger Scruton, Kent C. Bloomer and Charles M. Moore.3 Anthropomorphism is also a frequently expressed feature of architectural traditions in Africa. Labelle Prussin points out, for example, that the image and symbolism of the womb is often incorporated into West African earthern granaries.4 Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen have doc- umented the importance of anthropomorphism in African vil- lage planning and domestic architecture, particularly that of the Dogon of Mali. The Dogon lineage house (ginu da), they note, *. The basic research for this study was carried out among the Tam- berma from late 1976 to early 1978 under a Fulbright-Hays dissertation fellowship which I gratefully acknowledge. The paper was first pre- sented at the Frick Collection/Institute of Fine Arts Symposium, New York, NY, April i980. In its present form, the text is adopted from chapter IV of my dissertation, "Architecture of the Tamberma (Togo)," Columbia University, i98i. I owe a debt to my sponsor, the late Douglas Fraser; in addition, I am grateful to Shelly Errington, Kate Ezra, and David Van Zanten who read and criticized an earlier draft of this paper. I also wish to thank Mary Douglas, Richard Pommer, and David Rosand for related discussions and bibliographical references, and Donn Thomp- son who provided the drawings. My thanks to Robert Press and Sarah Travis for typing the various article drafts. The Tamberma or Batammariba, as they refer to themselves, are traditional agriculturalists who live today generally outside the influ- ences of either Christianity or Islam. They share certain architectural and cultural ties with other "Voltaic" peoples (the Dogon, Gurunsi, etc.). Previous research on Tamberma culture and history includes that of Leo Frobenius, Und Afrika Sprach, vol. 3 (Unter den Unstraflichen Athiopien), Berlin, 1913; and Paul Mercier, Tradition, Changement, His- toire/ les "Somba" du Dahomey Septentrional, Paris, 1968. My information on Tamberma architecture is based on in-depth in- terviews with community builders, priests, sages, healers, and historians. The observation and photographic documentation of ceremonies in which the house was an important focus of attention provided substantial subsidiary materials. It would be impossible to thank all those who helped me in my research by offering insight into the meaning of traditional architectural customs and ceremonies, but among those who were particularly important were the following: N'tcha, Banfoata; N'tcha, Lalie; Yapita, Wanna; Yapita, Baloa; Yafoata, Tano; Batchomou, Bou- nanka; Ibenekwakou, Falifa; Tchanfa, Atchana; Tchamou, N'dah; Touote, N'koue; N'koue, Touote; N'dah, Boukari; N'dah, Tchanta; and Ya- telwa, Kossi; Natta, Batchekote; Nafa, N'kankou; Yateloua, Tchokwe; Koufankou, N'tasakala; Yapita, Mani; N'dah, Fakanfa; Tamanta; Ou- boya; N'tchakaba; Olita; and Boukoua. j.

Jean Paul Lebeuf6 suggests in turn that for the Fali of northern Cameroon, the house is compared to an egg, with construction paralleling the process of gestation and birth. The earthen house sides and understructure symbolize the woman (representing her chest and sleeping position respectively); the house super- structure of straw and wood is identified with the man. In African architectural traditions, as in those of the West, human analogies in architecture are based in part on the use of the body as a paradigm for comparable structural, mechanical, decorative, and symbolic forms. The dominant anthropomor- phism in African architecture also reflects essential features of African religious views. Max Gluckman7 has noted that at all levels of African religion there are anthropomorphic beliefs in which the spirit world is modelled on the world of men. In the West, architectural anthropomorphism may have its primary basis in the valuation of the human body as an expression of 5- Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen, "The Dogon" in African Worlds, ed. by Daryll Forde, London, 1954, 83-110o.

Tamberma House-Body Symbolism In the architecture of the Tamberma (Fig. i) who live in northern Togo, anthropomorphism is one of the most important concerns of building design, decoration, symbolism, and use.9 In arranging forms to define the human, Tamberma builders turn to themselves, and in the process also incorporate their own and their culture's distinctive self view. Through this pre- dominantly human model, Tamberma buildings serve, in turn, as central symbols and structuring elements in Tamberma psy- choanalytic and therapeutic processes. The house is perceived to be an integral part of the family, and through it the psycho- logical well-being of each member is defined and, in part main- tained.1o j.l ;;'-:;B??+X I ?9i~ ,?

Young mother (seated on the house terrace) washing her baby with a protective fruit and herbal solution. The raised rim of the tabote hole can be seen in the foreground (author, 1977). In a variety of ways, the Tamberma suggest that their houses are human, that they represent men and women. The fabric of the house, for example, is compared to that of the human body: the earthen core is its flesh, the numerous pebbles are its bones, and the smooth clay plaster surface is its skin. Similarly, the male builder who designs and constructs the house, and the female house plasterer and wall decorator, his partner in art, have roles paralleling those of the male and female ancestors who are said to model and plaster every Tamberma baby from sacred earth in its mother's womb. Indeed, the basic element of construction, a small ball of earth, is the same whether the Tamberma are discussing houses or humans (Fig. 2). Not sur- prisingly, human proportions are also a central concern in the design process of each structure, the builder's leg and arm span being frequently used to determine the relative size of the var- ious parts (Fig. 3)- A house, once completed, is seen to have the same qualities as a new born baby. "When we build a house, it is like it is born," explained one young Tamberma builder. Both the house and the baby must be bathed in rich fruit and oil solutions so that their "skins" will become strong and resistant (Fig. 4). With proper care and good fortune, houses, like humans, are expected to live for about 56 years (or ten initiation cycles). When old, both the house and the human become dry and brittle. Each dies to give birth to a successor constructed in part with the fabric of the old. As a Tamberma village historian 8. Wittkower, Architectural Principles, i5ff., ioxff. 9. Tamberma houses are designed and built by individual male build- ers, who derive their talent or "gift" from family ancestors who were builders before them. These houses are two-story structures of earth which stand roughly 15-20 feet in height and 20-25 feet in diameter. They serve as residences for individual, generally nuclear, family group- ings. Each house follows the same basic design format, one which is defined by a set number of circular and oval rooms and supports placed in precise relationship to each other and united within a series of cur- vilinear joining walls. io. Examinations of the psychology of architecture in the West are found in works such as those of Geoffrey Broadbent, Design in Archi- tecture, London, 1973, and Clovis Heimsath, Behavioral Architecture, New York, 1977. Research in this latter area has emphasized both the psycho- sensory characteristics of architectural forms, and the socio-psycholog- ical factors determining architectural suitability.</page><page sequence="4">374 JSAH, XLII:4, DECEMBER 1983 BC~C1~5eb1~5 LHCJ-T a:8? u "~" Z~?ii ~W C~ *~_? i kc~;~i u- ;t, i" ~tlw; ~dar5 ~5Lit~XM ~rrsrr~uni, ~4lcaM4r;cr--z~l 7 ,k~t": ."- NP?Va/PrR~I~OTII~S~ ~e~e~S ~ ?:~;- ~L~L~IJtS - ~l"~i I*L~L~L~L~L~L~ (U~s;r, (2inks ?,,?~ 8:;?_,? ~; -~E~JW#, ?EMU) ;--.

Diagram of house with its human parts (Drawing by Donn Thompson). explained this process, every time a house becomes old and decays "it is like (the house itself) is dead, and wants to give birth to a new one." In the same way that the ancestors are said to place a part of themselves in every new fetus, the earthen core of an ancient house is incorporated into each new dwelling. i. The Upright Human House Tamberma men and women clearly associate the component parts of the house with their own anatomies (Fig. 5). The house is seen to be human both in a vertical or standing position, as when viewed from the exterior, and in a horizontal or prone posture, as defined by its ground plan. Oriented in the same way as Tamberma priests when they address the omnipotent sun god, Kouiye, each house looks west towards the sun's village in the western sky.1 Individual features and rooms of the house also show im- portant relationships with the human. The tiny fagade windows, for example, represent its eyes. They are called in Tamberma language, "the eyes of the wall" (falotinonfa). The front doorway is compared to the human mouth (linou), the means by which everything enters the interior. Just inside the front entrance are found stones used for grinding grain. Tooth-like in shape and white in color (from imbedded flour), these function as incisors to "chew" the millet to a fine white flour.12 The lintel at the top of the front portal is called by the Tamberma, takanabeta, a derivative of the word for "tongue" (fanalanfa). Above the door, the extended rim of the entrance roof has the name of "lip" (libani), a reference to its rimmed or lip-like form. Protruding from this lip are two (occasionally one or three) conical earthen mounds called "the horns of the entrance" (linakwanyeni). These are said to represent testicles-the source of house power and strength. Important anatomical features on the faCade include, among others,13 the house joining walls, which are compared with human joints because they connect each of the house's main parts, and the house raised granaries which ". .. represent the stomach of the house because this is where we put food. The house eats before we people eat."'4 The human-house analogies continue around the sides of the house, for here one finds "the drain pipe ... the penis of the house, for this is where it urinates."'5 Another pottery drainage pipe at the center back is given the name "the anus" (lifoumouli). On the terraced second story, in the sleeping room roof, is located a short wooden stick called "the backbone of the house" (koutchapinkou). Directly in front of the sleeping room chamber is a small ceremonial terrace-piercing hole called the tabote.16 ii. A human-based orientation in Tamberma architecture has also been suggested by Paul Mercier in his "Conceptions d'orientation chez les Betammaribe," Notes Africaines, 41, January 1949, 9-1o. 12. The earthen mortar hole on the opposite side of the vestibule is compared to the human eardrum because of its shape and resonating qualities. 13. The prominent earthen lines (called sillatcha, "the feet of the horns") which run between the door and the roofs "lip" are said to function both as the house's navel and as its main arteries. Like a navel, they define the exact center of the facade; like arteries, they stretch between the house's lower and upper extremities, uniting its two stories. Bile is the name given by the Tamberma to the long thin pieces of earth which seal the joints of each room. It was suggested that their shape is similar to that of bile. The wooden hooks on the entrance facade are called "the knees." These hooks, like human knees, are used for suspension. 14. A clay extension on this granary is called "the navel." Inside the granary, along with the fruits of the field, are found the clay balls which define the process of conception for each house member suggesting that the granary also has an important symbolism as a protective "womb." Such an association between granaries and wombs in West Africa was noted earlier by Labelle Prussin, "West African Mud Granaries," Pai- deuma, i8, I972, 144-169. 15. On the south side of the house, one often finds a raised earthen line which is known as "the nose" because of its role in protecting the health of the house. It is said that the souls of house members will follow "the nose" down to safety if malevolent spirits enter the house interior. In the Tamberma language, nose also means health. 16. The tabote hole is usually encircled with a low rim which is modelled out of earth (see Fig. 4). Frequently the tabote is also compared with a nose (see note 15 for another example of the nose), the source</page><page sequence="5">BLIER: ARCHITECTURAL SELF-IMAGES OF AFRICA'S TAMBERMA 375 This hole represents the human fontanel or cranial opening which is present in every human child at birth. On both the house (Fig. 4) and the child, this hole is seen as a secondary or spirit "mouth," the means through which nourishment passes from the mother to the child growing in her womb.17 2. The House as a Human Lying Prone Additional features of the ground plan and interior chambers of the house are said to recall a person lying prone, head to the east, feet to the west, the Tamberma position of sleep. In this posture, accordingly, the head of the house is found in the ground floor alcove which is called "the jawbone of the cattle room" (bounamounye). Since the head is the source of all human growth, the major phases of architectural construction are begun as close to this alcove as possible. In this horizontal position, the main terrace, with its expan- sive width, is compared with the chest. It is explained that houses with particularly wide terraces have large chests. The centrally placed woman's bedroom (Fig. 4), with its hollow circular form and rounded portal, is identified with the vagina and womb, the place of conception in the house. The small terrace area beside this room is "the large intestine" (kounokou) both because of its shape and because it is here where women use a special bowl for urination after the house has been closed at night. The legs of the house, in turn, are found in the entrance, a room appropriately called "the leg" (koutakou), i.e., the means of house transition, the link between the house and the outside. Midway between the sleeping room and the entrance cham- ber, the terrace tabote hole, which symbolizes the fontanel in the standing human image, is said to represent the equally im- portant solar plexis in the image of the house as a human lying prone. It is believed that the solar plexis is the locus of one's life and vitality. As one elder explained, the solar plexis contains "the gathering of life, the source of breath." Another added, this "is where the house breathes. Here its heart is found." 3. The Human House in Action Daily and ritual action connected with the house reinforces its human identity."1 For example, when a man joins his wife in her bedroom each night, he figuratively enters into the vagina and womb of the house to provide the house with future chil- dren. This bedroom "womb" also plays an important ceremonial role during initiation rites when Lifoni (the village men's as- sociation) novices are made to emerge from this chamber as newly born members of that association. With this in mind, the woman's bedroom of the village founder's house is consid- erably enlarged so that the entire class of Lifoni novices can rest inside together, then crawl out one after the other as if in multiple birth. In this way they become village brothers, born from the womb of the same village mother. The house tabote hole is important in still other ritual house actions. Tamberma women, for example, traditionally deliver their babies while positioned in the house interior directly un- derneath this hole. In this way they are placed both beneath the house solar plexis (the source of "breath," vitality, and health), and beneath its fontanel (the means of nourishment and life). After delivery, the mother returns with her newly born baby to the woman's bedroom "womb," the secure enclosed sleeping room where the child spends most of the first year of life. Other anatomical analogies are also elaborated through active use of the house. The house "eyes," for example, serve as organs of sight for those within the house. The portal "mouth" sim- ilarly receives the greetings which guests offer to the house when they come to visit. According to a Tamberma tradition, whenever one visits a friend, one must greet that person's house by peering in and offering a salutation to the "mouth" of the house. Such a greeting is made by the visitor even before he acknowledges the house occupants who may be working in the yard. This is explained as a form of etiquette which will assure that each house recognizes "its friends" and will give them protective shelter in times of danger. On other occasions, Tam- berma elders may share their gourd of beer with the house by splitting this drink with its doorway mouth in the same way that they share a gourd of drink with a friend. One elder, describing this action at a funeral, explained that "I wanted to drink with someone and no one was around (so I used) the wall to keep me company." The two house drainage pipes also have clear anatomical functions in normal and ceremonial house life. The house penis and anus accordingly are used to direct potentially damaging water outside the house both during rain storms and during the daily terrace bath. In addition, the house's penis has a special role in the purifying rituals after war. At these ceremonies, an herbal solution is poured through the penis drain pipe to bathe of health and respiration in the house. Underneath this central hole, in the terrace roofing structure, is a special ancestral wooden beam. This, like the earthen "feet of the horns" (see note 13), is said to serve as the navel. The incorporation of two nose forms and two navels in the house is consistent with the distinction between the vertical and prone body- house symbolism. 17. It is thought that the "essence" of various foods and liquids carried on the heads of pregnant women can pass through their fontanels into the fontanels of the babies growing within them. In this way, the fetus is provided with the necessary sustenance for development and growth. On Tamberma mothers and their young children, this fontanel area is often marked by a small circular coiffure. i8. Traditionally houses were thought to be able to move like hu- mans. As explained by one elder: Houses are like humans. The reason I say that they are like humans is because before, when we were migrating, we had our houses, and they followed us. When our ancestors would move, they took their houses with them. Now the ancestors are dead ... and the houses stay.</page><page sequence="6">376 JSAH, XLII:4, DECEMBER 1983 MOW - 41- pa 'Alk, At Ar lot 15: Fig. 6.

The anus serves a similar symbolic function after each birth, for the "remains" of the birth-the afterbirth-are buried in the ground underneath this pipe. From its inception, and throughout the process of its con- struction and use, the house is fed in characteristically human fashion. Indeed, every house is given its first nourishment at the foundation laying. At this time, fresh millet beer is poured onto the area called "the cattle room jawbone." On this occa- sion, according to one elder, "when one offers the house some- thing to drink it is as if one is offering to a man."'19 The house tabote hole is given nourishment during the rites which mark the end of house construction. As part of this ritual, the builder is given a celebratory meal which is served to him on the stone which will eventually cover the tabote hole. In this way, the ..... Fig. 7. Knocking off house "testicle" during the funeral. Village of Lissani (author, I977). house tabote cover is given its first solid food of grain, meat, and sauce. Later family meals, which take place around this central terrace hole, provide the house with additional food. Other equally striking forms of symbolic action involving the house take place during the funerals of family elders. The importance of the funeral in human-house action is based in part on the fact that throughout the funeral drama, the house serves as a surrogate for the recently deceased man or woman.20 Accordingly, a central feature of each funeral ceremony involves the initiation of the mortuary house into the various village associations with which the deceased had been identified. This initiation is performed on the house by community priests who circle the interior and exterior walls, tapping every "joint" (join- ing wall) and room with initiatory sacra and equipment-an action to recreate the principal joint-tapping rituals of initiation which are intended to assure the continued growth and increased strength of the novices. In another funerary action which is performed only for de- ceased men, the dead person's soul is attacked through special forms of aggression directed at the elder through his house.21 These actions are intended to force the elder's soul to leave the house to go to the world of the ancestors in the sky. In the first of these attacks, a ritual adversary of the deceased calls his secret birth name through the tabote hole (the house solar plexus and fontanel) in order to frighten the soul into quitting the body. Following this, the same man strikes the male (south) house horn (the house testicle), causing it to fall and break on the ground (Fig. 7). Comparable action in war is seen to be the 19. On other occasions, it is the main mouth of the house (the door- way) which is fed. Its nourishment takes the form of daily preparations of grain which are ground inside the entrance on the house stone "teeth." Other forms of portal meals are provided at the funerals of deceased family elders. At these times, millet is ground on the stone door sill [see Fig. 8 in S. P. Blier, "The Dance of Death: Notes on the Architecture and Staging of Tamberma Funeral Performances," Res: Anthropology and Art, 2, 1981, 107-143 (Peabody Museum, Harvard Uni- versity, and University of Paris, Nanterre)]. This is a symbolic indication that the deceased, now leaving the house, will no longer have need of food. In a later funeral action, egg-shaped mounds of cooked grain are ceremonially distributed in front of the door as part of the funeral payment. Still later in the concluding rites of the funeral, a special meal for the ancestor is offered in front of the doorsill in the hope that this ancestor will return to help bring out future children in the family. 20. Blier, op. cit., 116, note 19. 21. Deceased women are not treated in the same way because it is assumed that because they are strangers in these houses (i.e., wives originally from other villages), they would want to return to their home villages on their own accord.</page><page sequence="7">BLIER: ARCHITECTURAL SELF-IMAGES OF AFRICA'S TAMBERMA 377 a: I-:.:U? r s, 6, CC ~ -U F~ "i4,i ii a r jb -: Fig. 8.

Finally, as a symbolic last blow, the adversary shoots a poisoned arrow into the flesh of the house portal, piercing through the deceased's quiver which is hung up against it (Fig. 8). The adversary in this way has publicly and ceremonially vanquished the deceased, thereby assuring, in this way, his speedy departure. 4. The Dressed House The dress and decoration of Tamberma houses further define the human identity of these buildings. The delicate markings ornamenting the house facades, for example, are designed and incised by Tamberma women to recall their own body scarifi- cation patterns (Figs. 9, io). According to one builder, "We put the beauty of women on the house to show what women do. One imitates these women by saying that the house is a person." Like the newly formed cicatrization marks on young Tamberma girls, fresh house "scars" are bathed by the women with rich oils to assure that their surfaces will remain resilient and smooth. Several other features of house decoration also recall the dis- tinctive forms of Tamberma decoration. The thin earthen mold- ing around the bases of some houses is referred to as "that which it wears" (kouloukiekou), in other words, its dress. The undu- lating form of this line clearly suggests both traditional woman's parure, a long fiber cord wrapped around the hips, and the thin skin belt worn around the waist of a man. Similarly, the forked wooden staffs shouldered by young men and women as a sign of their youth are recalled visually by the forked "handles" at the top of each granary (Fig. i). The pro- ? ~aa~? ?~a~ ?? --~d ~iS~j~d~.~StcTI/ ) d Fig. 9. New cicatrizations on house and woman. Village of Koufitoukou (author, 1977). tective granary caps, in turn, suggest the woven straw hats worn by young men when they go off for initiation duels or war combat. The vines which sometimes encircle the granary are similar to -those which were traditionally carried as whips in the initiation competitions.22 Finally, according to one elder, the earthen house horns may be an allusion to the horned headdresses worn in men's and women's initiation rites. Other more elaborate forms of dress are placed on the house during the lengthy funerals of Tamberma elders (Fig. ii). At these times, the house is decorated to represent the deceased as a youth, at the moment of initiation into the men's or women's association. Rich, foreign-made cloths are hung over the upper walls of the house, recalling those worn over the shoulders of young men and women at the public ceremonies ending the initiatory cycle. "The reason we put the cloths on the house (at the funeral) is because these were used for initiation. We hang the (same) cloths on the house which we wore in initiation." These cloths veil the house in much the same way that they veil initiates, marking their separation from the community at this important life passage. Similarly during the funeral, a long cowrie (shell) belt23 is wrapped around the house or, in recent years, a shorter one is placed above the door (Fig. ii). This, too, is meant to recall the dress of young initiates. As a young priest explained: 22. The same vine is used to "whip" the house on its doorsill to begin the village Lifoni initiation cycle. 23. Cowrie shells are the traditional form of money in this area.</page><page sequence="8">378 JSAH, XLII:4, DECEMBER 1983 i -~?i : ~::SC?a" i;?::??

We place the cowries on the house saying that the house is human, and it is dead. When we went to initiation, we wore (cowries) didn't we? When he was still alive, he wore them, and when he dies we do not know how to have him wear them, so we make the house wear them .... It is as if the house is dead. For a man, animal skins, flutes, and his bow, quiver, and leather sack are also added to the house facade as part of its festive dress. These suggest the apparel worn by young men in ritual combats and dances of initiation. To make the point even clearer, during the funeral the deceased is dressed in the same manner while lying in state in the house interior. The body, placed on a fresh animal skin pallet and wearing a cowrie belt around the waist, is covered with a rich cloth pall. The man's quiver and bow are placed beside his head. According to one priest, the dominant human-house parallel in the funeral is intended to replicate the image of the deceased elder standing in the portal ready to leave the Earthfor the world of the ancestors. The moment the deceased goes out he [she] will face the west. The moment one holds this person to bring to the cemetery, the de- ceased's mouth will leave by the door (figuratively becoming the door). The Tamberma house thus memorializes each house member at the moment of greatest glory, as a deceased elder ready to join the ancestors. As portrayed in the house, however, the physical image of this ancestor is not that of a person 56+ years, but rather, someone in the bloom of youth, at the time of initiation. --o-,ow a~i_-;ot 0 ? or ~ ~~XMV ----- . . . . Fig. ii. "Dressed house" at the funeral. Village of Koufitoukou (au- thor, 1977)- Psychological Identity of the House Prone and standing, ritually active and beautifully decorated, the Tamberma image of the human is thus conceptualized in the house. The Tamberma view of the human as expressed in this architecture is, as we have seen, a generalized one incor- porating both sexes and several different ages. The Tamberma associate each person, however, with not only a physical aspect, the body, but also with essential psychological identity made up of many distinct parts. In Africa (as elsewhere) the essence of a person "... . is both physical and mental, and it is the coordination of the two which makes (one) a full (human)."24 Among the Tamberma it is generally believed that each person's psychological identity consists of three interrelated spirit aspects: i) the soul (liyouani) which defines one's life, being, and health; 2) the ancestral sponsor (ouba, "the one who guards one")-the source of one's family identity and protection;25 and 3) special deity and game sponsors (libo) who provide one with talents and additional support. These three separate spiritual compo- nents are a vital part of each person. They are also an essential part of each Tamberma house (Fig. 12). i. The Soul The soul (liyouani-literally "that which is hidden") of hu- mans and houses is said to be an invisible version of one's self. 24. Geoffrey Parrinder, Religion in Africa, New York, 1969, 28. See also, Idem, West African Psychology, London, 1951. 25. Also called yiebota, "the ancestor who brought you out."</page><page sequence="9">BLIER: ARCHITECTURAL SELF-IMAGES OF AFRICA'S TAMBERMA 379 (!5Vt4) Fig. 12. Diagram of spirit components of house identity (Drawing by Donn Thompson). As one priest explained, "the liyouani are like humans, but they do not walk heavily, they are like air. If you seize one, it will evaporate." Though invisible, a physical reflection of each per- son's liyouani can be found in the miniature earthen soul mounds (lissenpo) which are placed in front of each house door. The individual mounds in this composition shelter the souls of the various house occupants.26 These mounds, in their composition of individual circular parts (Fig. I3), suggest a miniature version of the house itself. The largest soul mound of the grouping, that which stands in the very center, contains the soul or liyouani of the sun, Kouiy&amp;, the ultimate source of all human and house life. Other features associated with the liyouani are also incorpo- rated into the form and placement of these mounds. For ex- ample, the liyouani is generally believed to rest in close proximity to the body in order to guard it from harm. "The liyouani of a person always remains near him," one elder explained. Or, as asserted in a Tamberma prayer, "the liyouani is born with you to watch over you." Reflecting this idea, the soul mounds of the house are placed near its main body. In this position, they can watch and protect the house (and its members) from danger. Accordingly, the "eyes" of these mounds are focused towards the house interior to observe those who enter. Another feature which is generally associated with the liyouani is its normally straight alignment with the body, i.e., its place- ment directly in front of each person to serve as a guide through life. As stated again in a prayer, "your liyouani must put itself in front of you and you will follow." The soul mounds of the house are similarly placed in front of and in direct alignment with the house. This alignment is a clear reflection not only of the identification of these mounds as guides, but also of their association with the psychological balance of each individual- expressed by the Tamberma through the metaphor of align- ment. This is defined most clearly in the Tamberma belief that if one's soul is not aligned with the body, i.e., if the soul is "off to the side," then the soul and body are not functioning together and one's balance and tranquility will not be maintained. Often, when in this state, one is said to suffer from excessive dreams and weight loss, a reflection of the independent life which the soul is now living. As one priest explained: When we say the liyouani put itself to the side, we mean that it is not following as it used to. When one's body wastes away in this manner, it is as if the liyouani no longer knows one. His liyouani did not recognize who he was. His liyouani looked at him and did not recognize his body. It passed next to him and did not agree to stay where it had stayed before so calmly. The state of being "to the side" is thus defined as one at odds with an ideal of harmonious alignment and balance. For this reason, when a person comes home after a long voyage, he or she is made to stand in a special place to the side of the house. There, after a ritual cleansing, the person is welcomed back inside the house and the family, and the balance is made once again complete. The direct alignment of the soul mounds with the house reinforces this idea. 2. The Sponsoring Ancestor Each Tamberma man and woman also has, as a distinct part of his or her identity, a close affiliation with the male and female ancestors who are responsible for their lives. These two ancestors (usually a man and his sister) are said to form each baby in the 26. It is important to keep in mind that in the Tamberma language, the soul of the house is synonymous with the souls of these individual members, since takyeta, "house," is also the word for "family."</page><page sequence="10">380 JSAH, XLII:4, DECEMBER 1983 ~?i?rr.:~ ~?~b~L~I~-ii --fi__~:uh*WL~i(~ - :sr ~--?---sigli~?CQp~;ina l.urW~ 1 L;9; I *- ~ :? ??s; E:'~PI ?: ?a*;. ~ ~a -iY ":b Fig. 13.

This relationship is explained in that an elder who was happy in life will want to return to his or her village and "bring out" or sponsor new children in that community.27 Not surprisingly, sponsoring ancestors are an essential part of the identity of every house as well. The earthen shrines of these ancestors are attached (lali) to the interior and exterior house walls (Figs. I, x2) in a way which is similar to how these ancestors attach themselves to their living descendants. They serve, ac- cordingly, as supports, protectors, and supernatural intercessors for the house and its various members. The placement of these ancestor shrines along the bottom of the house walls and their positioning in direct alignment with the door and east-west house axis reflect their critical roles in supporting and main- taining the inner balance and strength of the house and its members. 3. The Sponsoring Deities and Spirits A third component of each Tamberma person consists of the various deities and spirits who, after associating themselves with a particular Tamberma ancestor when alive, now accompany this person in giving life to and supporting new children. These .. W -ge, ... .. .. . .. .. Fig. 14. Painting the portal of the woman's bedroom. Village of Kou- fitoukou (author, 1977). powerful beings include both the spirits of wild game animals killed by the ancestor in the hunt and the special association deities (of war, fertility, divination, medicine, men's initiation, and women's initiation) who played a part in initiating this ancestor. The shrines of these accompanying deities and spirits are prominently attached along the faqade and interior walls of every Tamberma house. Their close association with the mem- bers of the family is made clear through a highly explicit system of parallel ornamentation. Jewelry is particularly important in this regard. An antelope, for example, may require that both its shrine and its human devotees be given the same type of bracelet, necklace, pendant, head ornament, or ring. This distinctive or- namentation form marks the bond between the two. As one priest explained: If an antelope sponsors a child, he [she] will wear cowries. When asking for these cowries, the antelope requires that you put the cowries around its shrine as well. Body painting is also used to demonstrate the close ties between deities and their human followers. Special pigments are applied in figural and symbolic patterns both to the houses and to the persons associated with these various deities and spirits (Fig. 14). Such paintings often recall the designs on the deities' own house shrines. Most are incorporated during ceremonies associated with such personages, the pigments themselves being derived from special medicinal roots or minerals identified with the deity in question. 27. This is not reincarnation in the familiar sense of the word, since each ancestral sponsor puts only a small part of himself in the child. However, the ancestors and the child are close enough so that the child is said to become bothered if either ancestor is in some way troubled.</page><page sequence="11">BLIER: ARCHITECTURAL SELF-IMAGES OF AFRICA'S TAMBERMA 381 TzfIIpkbze R4*#J 42PAOUNP LA asslu ////1 A  a ,( i t( ) N -----W Iod - (5/ A0JL~)-~ Fig. 15. Diagram of life passage changes in house soul mound placement (Drawing by Donn Thompson). The Architecture of Analysis and Therapy As we have seen above, the structure and symbolism of the Tamberma house reinforces an ideal of psychological balance and completeness. The prominent placement and careful align- ment of the subsidiary sacra (identified with each person's li- youani, sponsoring ancestors, and associated deities and spirits) in these buildings convey central features of the Tamberma view of their own identity and inner strength. In part because the house serves to symbolize Tamberma psychological norms, cir- cular stones which represent these structures are used in local divination practices as a means of determining the probable causes of problems affecting the psychological well-being of members of the community. These house stones are employed by local diviner-therapists (oupon) both to identify the ultimate source of a problem and to suggest its means of resolution. In the course of Tamberma divinatory analysis, the use of these symbolic house stones reinforces the importance of the Tam- berma dwelling as a potential source of knowledge about the family's past and present strengths and difficulties. Not surprisingly, in view of the role of the house in problem definition, many Tamberma personal difficulties are said to ne- cessitate some form of architectural change as part of their res- olution. Most of the problems which require such changes are attributed to life crises which mark important passages in each person's physical and psychological development. As a means of easing the trauma of such transitions,28 it is generally sug- gested that the person's soul mound (lissenpo) be moved within the house so that it will conform both in placement and in size to the individual's passage phase (Fig. I5). The soul mound of a young child, for example, which is constructed at the time of the child's first crisis, at weaning,29 is built in the center of his ~;1???.: ~gglig;8a(g~~ n ::?~ a*;, rC'I iii ii ~s '?~?- gD"-,~i~"~i yg ~jl~~ scifil~il~C- ;;?;ii~i~ii~iE~:'l~ ~? :Mt ""-i;,- ~?;" ;il~t:" r~p?LC ~ ?s~l ~I ?-Sc~~ K pi--~ r?~ ~I-8 t; Fig. 16.

The child remains closely identified with this room in his first years of life, and the newly built soul mound3s is seen to help shelter and protect the child's soul during the psychological difficulties identified with this period. When the child begins to walk, another life crisis is said to develop. To mark this passage, the child's mound in its mother's bedroom is broken, and a new, slightly larger one is built for the child downstairs near the altars of important family ancestors. The moving of this mound corresponds both with the child's widening spatial view as he gains mobility, and with the fact that now his likely sources of personal trauma are more closely identified with the house as a whole. At the crisis of puberty, the child's soul mound again is moved and enlarged. This time it is constructed in the circle of adult soul mounds which are placed outside the house in front of the door. This passage change, like the previous ones, is seen to 28. These problems vary from repeated nightmares, anxiety, or las- situde, to more complex troubles such as impotence, mental illness, or even death. 29. Before this rite, the child's soul is said to be soft and fluid, not needing a permanent "home." By the time of weaning, the child, clearly here on Earth to stay, requires a more permanent architectural and psychological identity. 30. The use of the child's feet as the pattern for this mound not only defines the appropriate mound size, but also shows the child's soul that this is the place where it should rest. When the mound is finished, the small earth or clay ball which was formed for the child at birth is now placed by this child in the mound center. This ball is identified with the earthen ball in the granary (see note 14) which is said to contain the name, talents, destiny, occupation, ancestral sponsors, and sacred protectors of the child. It also defines for the child the whole process of conception. When this mound is eventually broken and moved down- stairs, this ball of earth will be placed in the new mound constructed there.</page><page sequence="12">382 JSAH, XLII:4, DECEMBER 1983 coincide both with the child's changing spatial perspectives and with a shift in the likely sources of his various personal problems. The new mound placement reinforces the idea that during this age, his work, friends, and potential difficulties take him beyond the family and into the village as a whole. The crisis which accompanies marriage is associated with still another change in the soul mound placement. At this time, a slightly larger mound is built for the person at the couple's new house (Fig. 16). The existing mound of a single person of this age is rededicated in the portal mound cluster of the family. This transition is in- tended to correspond with changing perspectives of the family member. Middle age also is marked by a soul mound transition. At this time, however, the mound is not moved, but rather is rededicated at its previous position, this time with the expensive offering of a cow. This transition, like those which preceded it, is intended to provide the soul (liyouani) with a secure sec- ondary enclosure (the mound) where it will be safe during periods of stress or need. The Tamberma treatments for more serious forms of mental crisis, i.e., those associated with intruding deities and spirits which traumatize individuals by taking up residence in their bodies, also are frequently associated with changes in the house. One crisis-bearing figure is identified as Fayenfe, the Tamberma god of death and war. In serious Fayenfe cases, such as attempted suicide, treatment usually involves the requisite modification of the patient's house so that the Fayenfe god and its shrine can be housed within. Another form of mental crisis necessitating house modification during treatment is said to be brought on by the Tamberma Earth and underworld goddess, Boutaan. In these cases, shrines identified with Boutaan's healing powers are incorporated into the person's home in order to aid him or her in getting back in touch with the world. Koupon, the god of divination and analysis, is also frequently associated with mental crises. Soul loss and accompanying lack of interest in life are among the symptoms of Koupon-related illnesses. In such cases, the diviner-therapist searches for, finds, and then returns the lost soul of the individual to his mound. Afterwards, the person's soul mound is rededicated as a means of assuring that the person's soul will remain nearby. From these examples, it is clear that each house is seen to be not only a major source of knowledge concerning Tamberma psychological problems but also a par- tially malleable structure which can be altered or added to in order to help rectify those problems that do arise. Besides sym- bolizing an ideal of psychological balance and completeness, this use of the house reinforces the idea that the components of Tamberma psychological balance are seen to be continually changing. Conclusions Tamberma men and women, in viewing their houses as hu- man, clearly express an architectural vision of the full physical and psychological dimensions of their humanity. Through this architecture and its special form of anthropomorphic symbol- ism, the Tamberma define and actively redefine the multiple components of their own identity. For the Tamberma, as we have seen, architecture serves as a model of physical and psy- chological balance and completeness. Each house, accordingly, incorporates within its structure the body, soul, supporting ancestors, and sacred sponsors which are seen to be a necessary part of each person's self image. In cases when individual har- mony and balance is not maintained, the house in turn becomes the analytic medium through which the underlying problem and its possible solutions can be determined. In turn, Tamberma architecture plays a central role in various forms of traditional therapy which are undertaken as a means of restoring the patient's loss of identity and inner balance. Whether the associated treatments involve simple modifications to the soul mound, as in the various crises of one's life passage, or whether they include the more dangerous and costly con- struction of a new deity shrine in the patient's home, the im- plications are clear: without architecture and some form of ar- chitectural modification, there can be no stabilizing resolution. Without architecture, the Tamberma normative ideals of in- dividual balance and completeness cannot be achieved. Anthro- pomorphism and the psychology of architecture in this way appear to be closely joined, for in arranging forms to define the human, Tamberma builders, in part, turn both to themselves and to the cultures in which they are working. In this process, they express, through their architecture, essential dimensions of the self-image of each.</page></plain_text>
