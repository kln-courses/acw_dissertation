WELLS (Balti- more and London, 1995) Until 1789, citizenship in France, and more broadly in Europe, had little practical or ideological significance. Before the French Revolu- tion, citizenship in France was essentially legal membership in the state, which conferred only limited rights, notably the civil right to bequeath and inherit property. In 1789, however, citizenship became dramati- cally redefined: it became the source of an extensive array of rights.1 In a stroke, with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the modern citizenship of the Revolution transformed not only the terms of membership in the state, but the legal constitution of society and the state themselves. Whereas in the Old Regime there had been a highly developed system of legal superiority and inferiority, post- revolutionary citizenship inaugurated a sphere of equality in which the same rights were attributed to all citizens. Whereas the absolute mon- archy had described rights as favors bequeathed at its pleasure, citizen- 1 William Rogers Brubaker, "The French Revolution and the Invention of Citizenship," French Politics and Society 7 (summer 1989): 30-49; Michael Fitzsimmons, "The Invention of Citi- zenship," in The French Revolution and the Meaning of Citizenship, ed.

Not only were citizens offered guarantees against arbitrary governmental policy, they were given the positive freedom of participation in government, the chance to be in- volved in the decision-making process, primarily by electing represen- tatives. Democratic citizenship created a new basis for the legitimacy of the state. Sovereignty was no longer conferred by God from above or by ancient traditions; it was generated through the act of association of the citizens themselves. Modern citizenship, therefore, called for the formation of a new kind of state based on the principles of equality, freedom, secularization, and national self-determination. Given the centrality of rights-based citizenship for the Revolution, it is surprising that the concept of rights and citizenship has tradition- ally played a rather minor role in macrointerpretations of the Revo- lution. Several reasons may be suggested for this omission. Over the years, a variety of influential paradigms have tended to keep the issue of rights at the margins of scholarly inquiry. The concept of citizenship is ajuridical concept; it entitles individuals to legal claims on the state. The Marxist interpretation of the French Revolution turned rights and legal systems into tools of class domination. Because law was regarded as part of the superstructure, an outgrowth of underlying economic facts, there was no incentive to study how the juridical organization of society shaped social relations and networks of power autonomously. Although the Marxist explanatory framework was attacked and ulti- mately discarded, shedding the widespread tendency to see economic forces as more fundamental to social transformation than political and legal ones proved remarkably difficult. It still seemed logical to assume that legal rights and claims had scant ability to mold social relations in comparison with the pull of markets, the distribution of property, or the accumulation of wealth. Thus, although early revisionists attacked Marxism, they continued to see socioeconomic causation as fundamen- tal. Alfred Cobban, for example, poked holes in the Marxist claim that the Revolution ushered in bourgeois capitalism. Cobban did not go on, however, to state that the consequences of the Revolution should be sought elsewhere, in the creation of a new kind of state or in the in- vention of citizenship. Instead, he suggested that perhaps the French Revolution was a myth.2 The gradual orientation of the field toward the study of politi- cal culture did not necessarily make the question of rights an integral 2 "The Myth of the French Revolution," reprinted in his Aspects of theFrench Revolution (Lon- don, 1968), 90-111.</page><page sequence="3">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 219 part of its project. Some scholars turned to Alexis de Tocqueville's brilliant analysis of the Old Regime and the French Revolution for in- spiration.3 Tocqueville's work stressed the role of institutions and the state in shaping society, but his overarching emphasis on centraliza- tion made the question of legal rights peripheral. For Tocqueville, bureaucracy, not liberty, held the key to understanding the Revolu- tion. The sense of equality ushered in by the Enlightenment did not liberate the commoners or endow them with new dignity; it merely allowed the state to penetrate and control society more easily. Once upon a time, Tocqueville argued, corporate bodies had enjoyed cer- tain rights of self-government. His analysis raised the possibility that corporate groups might have become seedbeds, albeit limited ones, of participatory citizenship. Tocqueville's assessment that corporate insti- tutions were effectively moribund before the Revolution, however, did not promote this avenue of research. Other lines of inquiry also skirted the issue of rights. Michel Fou- cault offered a new portrayal of power as an all-pervasive, creative force that was dispersed throughout society and inscribed upon the body through a disciplinary process.4 Because power did not reside solely in the state or economy, attempts to transform the state would make little impact on the operation of power. Truth, for Foucault, was a social product generated through any number of discourses and sustained by associated practices for classifying, saving, and retrieving information. There was no one standard by which one could determine whether power was legitimate or illegitimate, usurped or rightful. Although Foucault's provocative work opened up some new lines of inquiry, the study of rights was certainly not among them. All of the issues around which rights were oriented-law, the power of the state, legitimacy, and oppression-were suspended by Foucault.5 Far more influential than Foucault has been Jurgen Habermas's theory of the public sphere, an arena distinct from the state where private citizens may come together to discuss their common affairs and produce public opinion.6 In the eighteenth century, as Habermas 3 The Old Regime and the French Revolution, trans.

Thomas Burger (Cambridge, Mass., 1989).</page><page sequence="4">220 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES shows, public opinion became a vehicle through which citizens, legally denied rights of political participation, could demand accountability from their governments. The idea of the public sphere is a critical element in understanding the formation of citizenship, that is, how citizens became informed participants in the political process even be- fore the advent of democracy. Habermas's theory, however, has not been carried over into an exploration of rights. One reason is that, as Nancy Fraser has observed, political participation in the public sphere "is created through the medium of talk."7 Habermas did observe that public opinion received an institutional basis in the constitutional state through legal guarantees of a free press and free speech. Historians of the Old Regime, however, have been drawn primarily to Habermas's presentation of the public sphere as a discursive mode of interaction in which "discussion was to be open and accessible to all, merely pri- vate interests were to be inadmissible, inequalities of status were to be bracketed, and discussants were to deliberate as peers."8 This kind of discussion produced public opinion, a consensus concerning the pub- lic good which was more reliable than the fallible decisions of any king. Public opinion became a form of power in the eighteenth century, but it was not the same kind of power as that implied by rights and sov- ereignty. Unlike rights, public opinion had no legally binding force; its strength was primarily discursive and persuasive. Thus, although Habermas's model of the public sphere is valuable in many respects, it does not necessarily lead to a study of rights, which calls for an analy- sis of the legal nature of state power and the institutions by which that power is legitimated, limited, and channeled toward various aims. Theoretical considerations aside, there have been other reasons for the hesitation to make rights and citizenship a focal point of revo- lutionary studies. As scholars have pointed out, many were called by the universal rhetoric of liberty, equality, and fraternity in 1789, but far fewer were chosen. Women, slaves, and the propertyless were among those denied the full benefits of citizenship.9 There remains a linger- ing suspicion of the effectiveness of legal declarations. Whether during the Revolution or today, there is no guarantee that governments with constitutions will abide by them. Nonetheless, as scholars like Dale Van Kley and Lynn Hunt have 7 "Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy," in Craig Calhoun, ed.

Many governments that have flouted their constitutions have still felt obligated to have some sort of constitution in the first place. Excluded groups have forced govern- ments to make equality of rights a reality rather than an ideal. And the scope of rights has been extended beyond the guarantee of equal op- portunity to include the far broader entitlements of the welfare state. Undoubtedly the most eloquent testimony for the importance of rights has been given by those groups denied them. The black civil rights movement, the rise of feminism, the fall of Eastern European commu- nism, the ethnic cleansings in Bosnia, and the threat of militant Islamic fundamentalism all show that rights guaranteeing equal opportunity, religious toleration, and personal security are not matters of second- ary political consideration. There has been an increased awareness that the promise of economic development without guarantees of freedom is a hollow vision. To bring rights and citizenship back into the story of the Revo- lution does not mean that a whiggish interpretation of history as the evolutionary unfolding of freedom has to be adopted. On the contrary, understanding the conditions by which it was possible for modern citi- zenship to emerge promises to open up a variety of historiographical issues that have lain dormant in recent years. More will be said about that later. First, it may be helpful to make some general comments about the study of rights and citizenship. Citizenship, whether in its ancient or modern forms, may be con- sidered from several different perspectives." As Michael Walzer has observed, citizenship is a legal concept: it involves membership in the state which has "a legally enforceable admissions policy."' 2 One per- spective for approaching citizenship, therefore, involves basic mem- bership in a political community, that is, the criteria by which the native, the foreigner, or the immigrant are defined. Citizenship allows individuals to make claims on the state, to enjoy the benefits that membership offers. Because governments erect barriers to keep out groups that they do not want to entitle, citizenship is always a story of exclusion, as well as inclusion. A second perspective on citizenship 10 The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief Documentary History, 1-15; and Dale Van Kley, introduction to The French Idea of Freedom, 1-20. Ronald M. Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (London, 1978), is a classic treatise in legal theory. 11 This paragraph draws on Peter Riesenberg's excellent introduction to Citizenship in the Western Tradition: Plato to Rousseau (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1992). 12 Spheres ofJustice: A Defense of Pluralism and Equality (New York, 1983), 36.</page><page sequence="6">222 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES is concerned with the institutional rights and duties associated with membership in the state, for example, the obligation to pay taxes, serve in the military, or belong to an established church. Alongside political rights and obligations, citizenship usually has a civil dimen- sion which confers the right to marry, to own property, and to work. In this respect, citizenship is not solely a political concept; it has material ramifications. Finally, a third perspective treats citizenship as an ideal for human conduct. Citizenship has often been depicted as a moral tool for transforming human beings. The ideals associated with citizen- ship -patriotism, heroism, self-sacrifice, loyalty, or virtue-reputedly provide an antidote to antisocial vices and help individuals to reach their human potential by participation in a political community. Citi- zenship may also form an important component of personal identity which helps to fulfill the human need for belonging. When the French Revolution created modern citizenship, it not only made individuals bearers of rights, it also made the state the sovereign body through which rights would be distributed and adjudi- cated. Before 1789, despite royal claims and institutions to the contrary, there was not one all-embracing body in France which defined politi- cal membership and distributed legal rights uniformly. The political community of the Old Regime was a confessional, corporately divided, hierarchical intersection of many intermediate bodies which were only loosely united through the institution of the monarchy. Individuals had multiple legal memberships that conferred unequal rights upon them within the state. French men and women were required to belong to the Catholic Church in order to enjoy full and uncontested civil rights such as freedom to marry, bequeath property, or hold office. Guilds and cities controlled the right to work in many lucrative professions, while membership in the order of the nobility conferred rights like tax exemptions. Although in theory the king was sovereign, in practice the monarch's laws fell upon subjects within the absolutist state with vary- ing weight. By destroying all of the intermediate semipolitical bodies, the Revolution institutionalized the state's claim to be sovereign and made the individual citizen, as opposed to the corporate group, the carrier of uniform rights. It also secularized the state and thus removed doctrinal belief from the realm of political membership. Although the new ideal of liberal and democratic citizenship was crystallized in the heat of the revolutionary moment, it presupposed a number of gradual, structural transformations. As the sociologist Bryan S. Turner has observed, citizenship involved the decline of hier- archical social structures and the emergence of egalitarian ones that linked citizens together horizontally, rather than vertically. Hence, citi-</page><page sequence="7">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 223 zenship depended upon the conceptualization of a sphere of "society" as an entity distinct from the state. Citizenship also presupposed the rise of a secular environment in which religion no longer served as the basis for political legitimacy and public identity. Citizenship was asso- ciated with the freedom of citizens to exchange goods and services, not only material goods, but also opinions and beliefs. Thus, citizen- ship arose in tandem with the development of public opinion and freer markets. Finally, citizenship went along with a process of legal deper- sonalization, that is, the development of formal rational law which was applied uniformly to individuals regardless of ascribed characteristics such as noble birth.'3 The formation of citizenship itself, however, it should be stressed, was not simply the peaceful outgrowth of rational trends. In 1789 it involved a revolutionary seizure of power. Since 1789 most extensions of citizenship rights have come through sustained protest campaigns or have occurred in tandem with the need to mobi- lize for war. Obviously it is not an easy task to chart how subjects became sover- eign, rights-bearing citizens. The story may be pursued on a variety of levels: cultural norms and their transformation; the institutional heri- tage of a society and its contested distribution of rights and duties; the effects of war, which demanded an enormous mobilization of money, men, and patriotic loyalties; and bitter struggles over religious free- dom. The authors considered below offer insights into many of these trends, although their primary consideration has usually been cultural definitions of legitimacy, sovereignty, and rights. Charlotte Wells looks both at the technical definitions of citizen- ship used in court cases and at the ideals of citizenship espoused by jurists and intellectuals from the period of the Renaissance to the French Revolution. According to Wells, the idea of modern citizenship was not very new at all: "France entered the modern age espousing a legal model of citizenship whose juristic aspects remained essentially unchanged from the beginning of the sixteenth century." 14 The urban world of the Renaissance Italian city-states, where jurists were reviving Roman law, served as an incubator for the concept. Feudalism had had no place for citizenship: it rested upon the personal, vertical ties of lordship and vassalage. In the early modern period, the horizon- tal, associational nature of citizenship was kept alive through cities, and the term citizen was closely associated with the legal privileges of the urban bourgeoisie. In the early Italian Renaissance, according to 13 Bryan S. Turner, Citizenship and Capitalism: The Debate over Reformism (London, 1986), 18. 14 Law and Citizenship, 122.</page><page sequence="8">224 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES Wells, the idea that the people themselves formed an independent, on- going corporation, was first espoused by Bartolus de Sassoferato, who transferred the ecclesiastical concept of the corpus mysticum to politics. According to Wells, in Bartolus's theory the corporate power of the people included the right to make law for themselves, and all citizens, as parties to the contract forming the corporation, were legally equal. Soon the sense of the people as a corporate body was extended from the city to the newly emerging monarchical states. This idea, Wells ar- gues, allowed French jurists in the sixteenth century to view French citizenship as membership in the corporation of people that embodied the state, not as subjection to a ruler. Despite Wells's claims, however, it is not clear that the Renaissance idea of citizenship actually had much practical effect in this period in France. The French monarchy came out of a feudal world where the personalism of clientage and the universalism of the Church made distinctions between native and foreigner largely irrelevant. The only way feudalism distinguished foreigners was through the droit d'aubain, a fee paid to the local lord by strangers on his estate. As Wells shows, for fiscal reasons, French kings gradually asserted their right to col- lect this fee and thereby created a much sharper national distinction between foreigners and regnicoles. She implies that the acquisition of citizenship, that is, the status of regnicole, by naturalization conferred fairly extensive rights, but she does not systematically describe those rights. In fact, it seems that the most important advantages were lim- ited to the civil right to bequeath and inherit land and the political right of eligibility for public office. Even so, citizenship was a necessary, but not a sufficient, standard for eligibility to many offices. Corporate groups usually had the right to veto candidates for offices in their com- panies, and municipal charters frequently mandated the selection of town councillors from particular professional and corporate groups. Wells contends that the rise of absolute monarchy turned the active citizen of the Renaissance into a passive subject. The primary theorist of this transformation wasJean Bodin who, according to Wells, believed that obedience was "the primary, indeed the only, duty of the citizen." 15 Wells also charts practical reasons why French kings decided 15. Law and Citizenship, 59. Compare Wells to Reisenberg: "For Bodin, the essence of a citi- zen is his potentiality for a political life.... Even in Bodin's proto-absolutist formulation, the subject who is a citizen is to be reckoned with. He has rights, he has property, he has some legitimacy in the political arena." (Citizenship in the Western Tradition, 223, 224). Wells argues that "Bodin showed little awareness of a bond among citizens" (59). Bodin, however, believed corpo- rate bodies provided the source of sociocivic bonds. According to Antony Black, Bodin was "the first to assign to friendship, in the traditional guild sense as a specific social quality peculiar to colleges and modalities, an irreplaceable function in the social order" (Guilds and Civil Society in European Thought from the Twelfth Century to the Present [Ithaca, N.Y., 1984], 131).</page><page sequence="9">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 225 to play a greater role in setting the terms of citizenship during the seventeenth century. One motive was financial. In times of fiscal dis- tress, the royal government revoked letters of naturalization to force subjects to repurchase them, although on calmer occasions it freed foreign workers from the droit d'aubaine in order to attract immigrants for French industry. A second goal was religious; Louis XIV and his successor both saw their states in confessional terms, which mandated the conversion of Protestants. In contrast to the authoritarianism of the seventeenth century, the period of the Enlightenment was characterized by a revival of natural law, associationalism, and internationalism. In 1760 the French govern- ment set up more than seventy reciprocal treaties between France and sister states to end many of the civil disabilities experienced by resi- dent foreigners. There was a practice of tacit religious toleration, and many Protestants were apparently naturalized, despite their religious affiliation. Wells concludes her analysis of citizenship in the eighteenth century by arguing that enlightened authors like Diderot reiterated many aspects of Renaissance thought. The idea of modern citizenship, therefore, was not so much an invention of the Revolution as the re- deployment of a much earlier juridical tradition. Although it is undoubtedly true that the modern concept of citi- zenship drew upon earlier ideals, Wells's argument is not completely satisfying. In general, Wells ignores the complex way in which corpo- rate membership and privileges during the early modern period cre- ated hierarchical, unequal layers of membership in the state. She does not always make clear the relationship between the theoretical con- cepts espoused by jurists or intellectuals and the actual practice of the period. The lack of institutional context and clear definitions of key terms, like equality, make the Renaissance period appear more egali- tarian and modern than it was. Wells argues, for example, that French Renaissance jurists saw France as "a community of individuals bound together by a common location, common interests, and the use of a common set of laws." 16 But what does a common set of laws mean in a country that had hundreds of local legal codes? She contends that Rene Choppin's only requirement for membership in the state was to reside in territory that belonged to the state. But what does territory mean in a period where the country of France had not yet been mapped? She uses the term equality to characterize the Renaissance conception of citizenship, yet she also acknowledges that Baldus de Ubaldis and other Renaissance jurists talked about grades of citizens with varying legal and political rights. In like manner, the absence of political con- 16 Law and Citizenship, 83.</page><page sequence="10">226 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES text makes it difficult to evaluate how close the views of the Renaissance and Enlightenment were. The Renaissance jurist Baldus, for example, used the concept of popular sovereignty to establish the autonomy of Italian city-states against the claims of the Pope and Holy Roman Em- pire; he was not concerned with democratizing the internal rule of his city. Diderot's Encyclopedie, by contrast, hoped to change "the common way of thinking." When Diderot argued that rulers governed by the delegated authority of the people, he was quite aware that his work had the potential to politicize the wider reading public. Wells observes that both Diderot and Baldus retained a sense of social gradations in their views of citizenship. If that is the case, then it is not clear why Wells also wishes to characterize both of their views as modern, which implies equality of rights. Surprisingly Rousseau, whose idea of the general will attacked both absolute monarchy and corporate privilege as funda- mental elements of a political community, is not given much attention. By characterizing the period of absolutism only as one of obedi- ence and subjection, Wells also downplays the role that the absolute monarchy played in changing the framework of political membership. There is no discussion, for example, of the importance of Bodin's con- cept of sovereignty. Modern citizenship presupposes the existence of a stable, political order in which many different kinds of individuals par- ticipate in the state on the same juridical basis. At the time that Bodin wrote, these conditions were not only lacking, but also difficult to con- ceptualize. In contrast to the relatively small, commercial world of the Italian city-states, the French monarchy faced the task of establishing its authority over vast expanses of land, powerful church officials, dis- sident religious groups, seditious seigneurs, and unruly cities. Bodin's definition of sovereignty as "absolute and perpetual power" in rela- tion to the "subject" gave all those ruled by the crown a homogeneous legal status as individual subjects. It was an attempt to impose a unitary political order on a society in which feudal lords still considered them- selves sovereigns who could, for all practical purposes, make their own laws. By placing the weight of her analysis of Bodin upon obedience, Wells passes over another contribution of Bodin, that is, how he both laid the groundwork for an analysis of the state as a body of sovereign power and simultaneously shifted the unit of membership in the state from the group to the individual. Overall, Wells provides useful information on the juristic construc- tion of citizenship in the early modern period, particularly where tech- nical legal matters are concerned. The book, however, could have ex- plored more systematically how privilege severely restricted the ability of citizens to enjoy common rights as a whole. As a result, Wells tends</page><page sequence="11">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 227 to present too strong a view of the practical significance of citizenship in the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and, hence, too weak a view of the institutional transformation effected by the Revolution. Peter Sahlins's nuanced study of the relationship between terri- tory, identity, and jurisdictional authority along the Franco-Spanish border reveals the complexity of political affiliation in the state, both before and after the Revolution. In 1659 France acquired part of the canton of Cerdanya, a Catalonian valley in the Pyrenees. Sahlins com- pares how members of villages on each side were ruled, taxed, and drafted by their respective governments and how the villagers' identity and rights were shaped in the process. A primary theme of Sahlins's book is the transformation from the imperfect "jurisdictional sovereignty" of early modern French mon- archs to the far more systematic "territorial sovereignty" of states emerging in the mid-eighteenth century. The territorial boundary be- tween France and Spain did not initially establish uniform rights of rule on each respective side. The rights of subjects and powers of rulers were situated in a honeycombed web of overlapping jurisdictions that criss- crossed the valley's territory. Although individuals owned land as pri- vate property, other peasants had use rights to their arable land. Some village communities in France elected their own syndics and issued local ordinances, but were simultaneously subject to the seigneurial jurisdiction of a lord across the border in Spain. The territorial division between France and Spain ran right through the old diocese, so that subjects of the French king were under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of a Spanish bishop. French property owners established residency in Spain to avoid paying the capitation tax in France. Periodically, occu- pying armies swept into the valley, disregarding the political boundary completely. In those circumstances, local identities were multiple and fluid, but they primarily revolved around the defense of village corpo- rate rights. Sahlins shows how the French state, far more than the Spanish one, began to impose itself on Cerdanya and close up the territory it governed. The goals were primarily military and fiscal. The government wished to make defense of the border easier and to stop smuggling and desertion. In the eighteenth century, the French government also tried to enforce the use of the French language in the administration and in liberal professions. The aim was to facilitate administrative tasks, not to create a sense of cultural closeness between ruler and ruled. The French Revolution vastly extended the territorialization of the nation by obliterating foreign and ecclesiastical jurisdictions and by identify- ing the patrie with its land, rather than with the French monarch. After</page><page sequence="12">228 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES the defeat of Napoleon, France was required to return to its bound- aries of 1792. An international commission composed of French and Spanish engineers only formally settled upon a fixed boundary in the Pyrenees in 1866. The process proved difficult in large part because vil- lages near the border still had communal rights to pastures and water outside their own villages. Several revisions of the boundary were nec- essary to satisfy the peasants' complaints and to complete the process of territorialization. Villagers, meanwhile, were engaged in their own process of nation- alizing identity. Sahlins stresses that the levels of identity operated in a segmented fashion that allowed villagers to identify their interests with quite different groups depending upon the occasion, goals, and perceived enemies. During war, Cerdan peasants in Spanish territory might identify with the Spanish government against their hated French foes. When it came to taxes placed on the region by Spanish rulers, however, the villagers usually joined together to oppose Spanish offi- cials as outsiders. If several villages became engaged in a dispute over communal rights, former friends would, in turn, become rivals, and identity would become characterized by extreme particularism. Before their annexation, the Cerdans had been hostile to the French, who usually came in the guise of conquering soldiers. After annexation to France the Cerdans established links with the French state primarily for instrumental reasons. They came to see that state authority could be used to empower as well as threaten villages. The elite learned French in order to engage in commerce and administra- tion, although Catalan remained the language of religious devotion and family matters. Villages that had resolved their own complaints in the seventeenth century began to call on the state to arbitrate disputes in the next century. Overall, however, the French government was still perceived as a distant enemy. The French Cerdans did not rally in support of the French Revolu- tion; in fact, many left the country. Patriotic identity in the region was still cast first and foremost within a religious idiom. The Spanish Cer- dans denounced the revolutionary French as "Godless heretics," much as they had denounced their French enemies as heretical Huguenots several centuries earlier. Despite their aversion to the Revolution, most of the French Cerdan emigres returned to reclaim their lands and their rights as "good tax-paying citizens." They were able to invoke their legal status and rights as French citizens without sacrificing their cul- tural and linguistic identity as Catalans. Gradually, the use -of Catalan was reduced to folkloric status on the French side of the border, whereas it continued to flourish on the</page><page sequence="13">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 229 Spanish side. Although Catalans in France in the twentieth century were aware of their ethnic heritage, they demonstrated little support for separatist Catalan nationalism, in contrast to strong backing over the Spanish border. The reason, Sahlins suggests, is that the French Catalans had benefited materially from their status as citizens in the French state to a far greater degree than their counterparts in Spain. The French government supplied its region with roads and public ser- vices like insurance and education, whereas the Spanish government provided far less. Sahlins's comparative story thus ends with two important lessons. Separatist national sentiment is not the inevitable outgrowth of a pri- mordial ethnic identity rooted in the separate language, history, and culture of a region; it is a modern political construction. Although Catalans in France cherished their cultural heritage, they came to con- sider themselves French citizens with a stake in the French state. Sec- ond, modern citizenship has the capacity to integrate groups of differ- ent ethnic and racial status into one state if the terms of membership are equitable. In France, Catalan loyalty to the French state was ulti- mately forged through a mutual exchange of services whereby both parties gained. Although Sahlins does not explore only the instrumen- tal uses of citizenship rights, his work does point out how essential those uses are for shaping bonds between government and society. The next two authors, Daniel Gordon and Guy Chaussinand- Nogaret, bring us back to intellectual history and to the question of the role of the Enlightenment in the construction of revolutionary citizen- ship. The goals of their books are diametrically opposed. Chaussinand- Nogaret wants to show that the world owes a great debt to the Enlight- enment for inventing the language of liberty that made resistance to oppression and the liberal Revolution of 1789 possible. Daniel Gordon, by contrast, wants to demonstrate that French philosophes created a novel ideological space of sociability that gave participants a sense of dignity but neither challenged the structure of absolutism nor encour- aged the development of political equality. Chaussinand-Nogaret thus sees the Enlightenment as the ideological source of modern rights of citizenship, whereas Gordon believes that Enlightenment sociability and the growth of public opinion had no necessary relationship to the Revolution and its reconfiguration of the state. The argument that new forms of sociability underlay the revo- lutionary reconstitution of the state in 1789 has taken several forms. Habermas, as we noted earlier, proposed that new private spaces of voluntary associations were formed in the eighteenth century, a pro- cess that allowed individuals to retreat to salons, lodges, coffeehouses,</page><page sequence="14">230 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES and intimate family settings. The exchange of ideas among individuals within new associations made possible the formation of public opin- ion whose structure and claims challenged the closed, secretive rule of absolute kings. Public opinion was institutionalized in the Revolu- tion through constitutional guarantees like freedom of speech and the press. Thus, Habermas's theory of the public sphere makes voluntary associations part of the story of the emergence of liberalism. The mod- ern liberal state is unable to co-opt and speak for the forces of society so long as citizens constitute a public that has its own space for delibera- tion. Gordon has been strongly influenced by Habermas, but wishes to argue that not every instance of privatization in the social sphere in the eighteenth century was a precursor of a future revolutionary situation. A second view relating associational life to the Revolution was that of the conservative Catholic historian, Augustin Cochin.'7 Cochin contended that the sociability of salons, lodges, and other voluntary associations presaged the radical egalitarian ethos of Jacobinism dur- ing the Terror. According to Cochin, voluntary associations, unlike the hierarchically constituted corporate bodies of the Old Regime, were self-constituted and governed themselves according to the will of their members. Both voluntary associations and Jacobins generated their own equality and legality from the adherence of abstract individuals to the group. Hence, the radical Revolution, during which the "general will" ran roughshod over society, was made possible by the rise of vol- untaristic Enlightenment sociability. Historians, as Gordon points out, have shown the absurdity of a direct, causal connection between Enlightenment sociability andJaco- binism. Associational life flourished in a number of countries that had no revolutions and continued to flourish in France after the Revolu- tion during the Restoration. Nonetheless, Cochin's model has influ- enced Gordon in two ways. First, it has prompted Gordon to ask how we can talk about sociability without using the Revolution to define its essential meaning. Second, while Gordon rejects Cochin, he has im- plicitly adopted Cochin's view that democracy during the Revolution was essentially a destructive force resting in will, and not a liberal sys- tem based on constitutionally guaranteed rights of liberty, equality, and participation. At points in the book, therefore, Gordon seems overtly suspicious of democracy.'8 This may explain why, beyond purely schol- 17 Les Socigtis de pensge et la democratie moderne (Paris, 1979). An important explication of Cochin is Furet, Interpreting the French Revolution, 164-204. 18 "[Als the Revolution showed, there is a competitive spirit in democracy, a voracious pur- suit of power, and a degeneration of language that render absurd the Enlightenment belief that free communication is enough to constitute and temper authority" (243).</page><page sequence="15">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 231 arly grounds, Gordon wishes to disassociate the Enlightenment, which he cherishes, from too direct a relationship with revolutionary democ- racy, which seems immediately to conjure up the Terror. As Gordon demonstrates, sociability was a distinctively eighteenth- century concept. The term itself came into vogue through the school of natural jurisprudence of Grotius and Pufendorf. Those thinkers ar- gued that the first goal of man (to use their own term) was his own preservation, but that, weak and helpless alone, man could not survive without the cooperation of others. As a result, there was a natural ten- dency for men to unite into society for their mutual self-preservation. For Pufendorf, society and sociability were grounded neither in the will of the members nor in contract, but in utilitarian bonds of self-interest that ended up promoting fellowship and peace on earth. Because life, liberty, and property made reciprocal exchange and the survival of the species possible, they were considered natural rights. Gordon continues by arguing that the idea of sociability was dis- lodged from its initial setting in natural law jurisprudence and spread through other genres of inquiry. At first, sociability became central to a new seventeenth-century literature on courtesy that promoted an ideal of refinement, politeness, and civility cultivated through salons. The new norms of politeness did not encourage haughty demonstrations of superiority and deference that were common to the artificial manners at court. Instead, they promoted the free and natural exchange of ideas through the art of pleasurable conversation. From courtesy literature, the idea of sociability migrated to eighteenth-century historiography where Scottish thinkers,'9 and their French translators, notably Jean- Baptiste Suard, turned civility and commercial exchange into a stage of the evolutionary progression of civilization rooted in exchange and need. Gordon concludes with the career of Andre Morellet, a pro- physiocratic reformer who used the ideals of sociability to develop a theory of public opinion. For Morellet, public opinion rested upon a kind of generalized conversation among members of society at large that distilled truth out of conflicting ideas and instructed, but did not legally bind, the government. In all of these cases, with the possible exception of Morellet, Gordon associates the ideal of sociability with a detachment from poli- tics and a sense of equality that was limited to private, personal inter- actions. The new structures and ideals constituting society, Gordon 19 David Hume, "Of Liberty and Despotism," in Essays, Moral, Political and Literary (India- napolis, 1987); William Robertson, The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V, 3 vols.

The Revolution was a shock to this way of living and thinking. As soon as privileges were destroyed on 4 August 1789, for example, Morellet condemned the revolutionaries for their passion for change. Of course, he also had good reason to protest on self-interested grounds, because he stood to lose his sinecure, a cleri- cal benefice with dues acquired only the year before. Gordon's thesis on Enlightenment sociability is stimulating and thought-provoking, but evidence from other scholars casts doubt on the degree to which the new ideals of society and sociability can be de- scribed as apolitical, removed from policy-making concerns of govern- ment. Pufendorf developed his idea of sociability in order to create a universal basis forjurisprudence that could meet the potent challenges created by the wars of religion, the rise of philosophical skepticism, and the authoritarian politics of Thomas Hobbes. Prior to Pufendorf, the wars of religion had made ideological division within the state per- manent. Skeptics were asserting that beliefs, and hence all laws, were relative to time and place. Hobbes tried to refute skepticism by argu- ing that the right of self-preservation was universal, but he concluded that the only way to make this natural right effective was to surrender all natural liberty to the state. By creating a notion of society based in reciprocal human need, Pufendorf wished to establish a secular, eter- nally valid, non-Hobbesian basis for jurisprudence.20 If society were based upon mutually sustaining self-interest, rather than upon common religious bonds, religious persecution would have no justification. As Marvin Becker points out, this implication helps to explain why Jansenists like Pierre Nicole and Jean Domat figured so prominently in the construction of the idea of secular society rooted, somewhat paradoxically, on self-love.21 The self-regulating nature of a society based upon reciprocal exchange also became a fundamental creed of the new science of political economy whose liberal adherents launched numerous reform campaigns from the period of Louis XIV down to Turgot.22 By the mid-eighteenth century, as Chaussinand- Nogaret points out, the article "Representant" in the Encyclopedie con- 20 Richard Tuck, "The Modern Theory of Natural Law," in The Languages of Political Theory in Early-Modern-Europe, ed.

Just as absolutism fash- ioned the idea of a state which claimed sovereignty, so this strand of the Enlightenment created the idea of society which allowed for on- going rights and relationships predating a contractual formation of the state. The Enlightenment, it could be argued, made it possible for society to confront the state in 1789. In fact, that is the argument of Chaussinand-Nogaret. Chaussinand-Nogaret's short, heartfelt essay asserts that the ideals of the Enlightenment allowed individuals to renounce their status as subjects in 1789 and become free, rights-bearing citizens. Each chapter is dedicated to a representative thinker or group, but the theme is rela- tively straightforward. Proponents of absolutism argued that the king ruled on earth in God's stead, that the monarch's will had the force of law, and that rights were a grant of the king. There was no place for an autonomous society or nation vested with independent rights. Various thinkers of the Enlightenment invented an independent sociopolitical sphere, the nation, as an alternative to royal power. The nation was por- trayed as a community that predated the sovereign and as one whose members, citizens, had rights guaranteed by natural law. Ideally, the goal of positive law should be to provide a stable, regular framework for social relations and to promote the general welfare. The vascillating and oppressive policies of monarchs clearly did not meet this goal. Philoso- phes came to realize that the will of the king, a mere "creature" of God and not God himself, as Diderot pointed out, could never be regular, constant, and just. At first some philosophes hoped that creating a sane, reasonable monarchy subject to law could rectify the situation, or, as Chaussinand-Nogaret puts it, they believed that more monarchy could cure the monarchy. Under the pressure of practical situations, however, intellectuals like Mably and d'Holbach moved toward a more republi- can solution by which government existed only through the consent of the governed and citizens had rights of participation in the nation. Chaussinand-Nogaret's work is a thoughtful essay designed for a 23 Le Citoyen des lumieres, 93, 164.</page><page sequence="18">234 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES popular audience. As such, it is not concerned with scholarly details or academic questions of methodology; there are no footnotes or bib- liography. Obviously there will be some loose ends in an approach like this. Chaussinand-Nogaret has no interest in deconstructing his texts and uncovering internal contradictions. He emphasizes the progres- sive tendencies in the thinking of these philosophes, not their problem- atic qualifications. The social situation of the authors is also of little import. Chaussinand-Nogaret is well aware that some of the philosophes reaped the benefits of privilege in the Old Regime, but he implicitly dismisses Robert Darnton's thesis that the intellectuals of the "High Enlightenment" were co-opted by the lure of the good life and aris- tocratic patronage.24 Although Chaussinand-Nogaret does not explore the actual response of the philosophes to the Revolution, he claims that they were firm supporters of the Revolution. Revolutions, he notes, are always made by members of the "establishment," either with their direct backing or through their complicity. The support of the philosophes for the Revolution, however, extended only to the liberal, constitutional goals of 1789, nothing beyond. Perhaps this is the reason Chaussinand- Nogaret does not treat Rousseau in his book. Doing so might make it less easy for him to cordon off the Enlightenment for liberalism. Was the revolutionary citizenship of 1789 a continuation of radi- cal ideas developed during the Enlightenment or a new invention, an extension of trends from the Old Regime or a break? An excellent collection of essays edited by Dale Van Kley provides insight into the conflict-ridden process whereby the revolutionaries attempted to give permanent, legal form to the modern idea of citizenship. The eight essays of the book address both the long-term origins of various rights and the particular moment when the National Assembly hammered out their concrete meaning.25 Several themes run through the book. First, the roots of the modern idea of citizenship should be considered in terms of the institutional practices of the Old Regime as well as through its intellectual discourses. The Old Regime provided multiple intellec- tual and institutional spaces which never succumbed to the monarch's claim to embody the state and its rights. These included not only the salons of the philosophes, but also traditional, corporate spheres of re- sistance: magistrates and lawyers in the parlements, dissenting priests in the Church, and groups of venal officeholders whose public right to rule was tangled up with a private right to property. A rhetoric of 24 "The High Enlightenment and the Low Life of Literature," reprinted in The Literary Underground of the Old Regime (Cambridge, Mass., 1982), 1-40. 25 The author was a discussant at a conference at which preliminary drafts of the essays were read.</page><page sequence="19">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 235 rights was being hammered out in battles between the monarchy and corporate groups and in battles between those inside and outside privi- leged bodies. Citizenship thus emerged in conjunction with practical debates over the exercise of power, as well as through the more theo- retical reflections on the foundations of legitimate power. Second, neither the French Revolution nor its Declaration of Rights should be given a "neo-absolutist, unitary reading," that is, the Revolution cannot be interpreted essentially as a transfer of an all- encompassing sovereignty from the king to the people that, in both cases, negated the viability of rights. Just as the corporate heritage of the Old Regime served as a foil to extreme versions of monarchical sovereignty, so the rights of citizens acted as a counterpoise to un- limited interpretations of popular sovereignty (though there is a bit of division among contributors on this point). Third, the drafting of the Declaration of Rights was a disputed enterprise whose outcome was not predestined. The wrangling surrounding the drafting of the Declaration shows that there were deep-seated differences over how to establish and distribute rights. Ultimately, developing a language of rights in opposition to despotism and aristocracy proved easier than setting the terms by which diverse groups would be integrated into the new political community. Despite some common concerns, the authors do not have a party line on the origin and construction of the rights of citizens. David Bien casts the question of egalitarian and participatory citizenship within the vast framework of the military and financial revolutions of the early modern period. Bien does not make the more common argu- ment that taxation created the groundwork for citizenship by giving subjects a claim on their government in return for financial help. In- stead, he looks to the role of venal offices, the financial milk cows of the French monarchy. By creating a wide network of corporate bodies, all endowed with property rights and privileges in return for cash, the monarchy provided a multiplicity of institutions, "mini-parlements," in which citizens developed habits of self-government along egalitarian lines. The Revolution was not simply an abolition of corporate bodies; it was a transfer of their ethos of participation and internal egalitari- anism from intermediate bodies to the nation. Bien's position is novel in that he argues that a sense of equality, and not just an ethos of liberty and participation, developed within privileged corporate groups. There are some parallels between his argu- ment and that of scholars who believe that egalitarianism was develop- ing within voluntary associations before the Revolution. How the sense of equality inside corporate bodies was transferred from corps to the</page><page sequence="20">236 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES nation, however, remains obscure in Bien's interpretation. One prob- lem for this line of argument is that corporate groups were more than bodies of property, right, and participation, which were features con- stitutive of citizenship. They also were organizations that demarcated their members' social status. A group may have a sense of internal equality-self-administration, common dues, charters of association- coupled with very selective external boundaries, country clubs, for ex- ample. Can the internal equality of a group like a country club or a corporate body become the basis for a national sense of equality, or is its internal equality formed, by definition, in opposition to outsiders? What might possibly make the external boundaries come down to free up the sense of equality within? And how widely would the new sense of equality extend? Bien's interpretation thus has the virtue of linking questions of liberty, equality, and participation to the wider issues of war, fiscality, and corporate structures, but it does not fully theorize the relationship between corporate and national status. Kent Wright's instructive essay presents one possible solution of how egalitarian ideology was transferred from the elite to the nation. Wright demonstrates how the extension of equality from the nobility to the Third Estate was the product, in part, of political strategies. Ac- cording to Wright, the fight against monarchical despotism in the Old Regime generated a "negative unity" among the privileged elite under the egalitarian-sounding banner of the nation. The need to create a more inclusive set of alliances against the arbitrariness of the crown ended in the elaboration of successive versions of national sovereignty, each wider than the last until, finally, it was possible for the nation to turn on its privileged creator. Van Kley, in a somewhat different ap- proach, traces liberty and equality back to two different historical tradi- tions. The corporate regime was instrumental in developing a discourse of liberty based in rights to resist monarchical tyranny. The absolutist government, by contrast, created a discourse of equality, grounded in appeals to the national welfare, in order to broaden its tax base and attack aristocratic opponents. The revolutionary synthesis drew from both traditions to allow citizens the simultaneous enjoyment of liberty and equality. David Bell presents yet another view of the origins of equality. He believes that lawyers in the Parisian parlement developed egalitarian ideals in reaction to the rigid, hierarchical organization of the aristocratic parlements. Those lawyers, furthermore, publicized the concept of natural rights in a dramatic series of causes celebres before the Revolution. According to Bell, a lingering suspicion of the parle- ments not only generated a commitment to equality, it also prevented the revolutionaries from establishing a Supreme Court on the Ameri-</page><page sequence="21">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 237 can model to check legislative sovereignty. Like Sahlins's Cerdan peas- ant communities, the corporate regime seems to have been composed of multiple, segmented interests and identities that could be deployed in a variety of ways, some of which ultimately led to a national justifica- tion for rights at odds with the particularistic base of corps themselves. The enjoyment of equal rights in 1789, to be sure, had its limits. Shanti Singham explores the barriers to equality posed by gender, race, and religion. Becoming a citizen meant shedding corporate identities and assuming a national one. But what happened when one's corpo- rate identity was bound up in the ethical duties of one's religion, as it was for the Jews? The revolutionaries could grasp citizenship only as a form of assimilation, Singham contends, which made conceptualizing the Jewish citizen difficult, even after toleration was granted. Similarly, most of the revolutionaries assumed that full members of the state had to be of the same color and sex. It took a bloody uprising in Saint Domingue to emancipate mulattoes and black slaves, while women drew few concrete benefits, if any, from the Revolution. Hence, the ex- pansion of membership in the state to all propertied, white males was accompanied by a rigidification of boundaries in terms of gender and race. Protestants, as Ray Birn demonstrates, could be assimilated more easily than Jews. Yet there was little enthusiasm among most revolu- tionaries for toleration beyond a limited right of conscience, and the final wording of the article implied that practice of Protestantism still represented a potential threat to public order. Keith Baker explores the moment at which the revolutionaries became aware of the nation as a self-constituting body of power. The abbe Sieyes was instrumental in arguing that the French Declaration of Rights did not merely usher in negative freedoms that limited the arbi- trary authority of the monarch; it inaugurated a new kind of power, the sovereignty of the nation, that broke with the past. Baker also demon- strates that many members of the National Assembly, especially nobles, were afraid to promulgate abstract principles of equality among the ignorant and propertyless masses. The deputies labored with two fears: the fear of social disorder, which could be unleashed by appeals to ab- stract rights, and the fear of despotism, which cried out for limitation by legal measures. Rule by law seemed to provide a solid base that could contain both disorder and despotism, but law, in turn, was the expression of the general will. This left open the possibility that politi- cal will could ultimately take precedence over the exercise of rights. The Declaration of Rights itself did not resolve this ambiguity, but Baker argues that the constitution eventually favored a Rousseauian solution that gave a unicameral legislature the right to speak for the</page><page sequence="22">238 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES general will. As a result, the ambiguities of the Declaration permitted the emergence of a revolutionary dynamic that subordinated the rights of individuals to the will of the nation. Not all authors in this volume, however, agree with Baker's nega- tive assessment of the political consequences of the Declaration of Rights. Wright, for example, concludes that the version of the general will adopted by the National Assembly was "of the mildest sort pos- sible." The Declaration, Wright concludes, represented an important step toward the construction of modern-style republicanism, a repub- licanism that both secured negative freedom from oppressive power and offered citizens the positive liberty of participation in a democratic government. After reading these essays one understands why the Declaration of Rights can give rise to such a variety of competing scholarly inter- pretations. Contradictory interpretations of rights were inherent in the ambiguities of the text, which stemmed from the conflicting goals and social situations of the revolutionaries themselves. As Thomas Kaiser observes, the members of the National Assembly left the language of the article on the "sacred and inviolable" right of property intention- ally vague to avoid conflict: property itself was never defined at all. This omission meant that the revolutionaries had a great deal of latitude in defining property according to particular circumstances. Overall, the essays in this volume have much to recommend them: they are cogently argued, offer a well-researched synthesis of relevant literature, and leave room for both historical trends of the Old Regime and the contin- gencies of the moment in the formation of the Declaration of Rights. The ambiguities surrounding the creation of citizenship are fur- ther explored in William H. Sewell's engaging study of the abbe Sieyes, the famous revolutionary of 1789, who began his political career by ex- coriating noble privilege and ended it by becoming a count. Sewell's goal is not merely to explicate various texts of Sieyes. He wishes to use the experience of Sieyes to illuminate the revolutionary experience as a whole and to seek out the contradictions embedded in this radical project. According to Sewell, Sieyes's enormously influential pamphlet What Is the Third Estate? set the agenda for both a political and social revolution: political because it made the nation a self-constituting source of sovereignty, social because it made the downtrodden Third Estate "something" by abolishing privilege and shifting power to the "productive bourgeoisie." Sewell, like a number of historians before him, traces the foundations of Sieyes's radical political thought to a blending of political economy and social contract theory. Drawing</page><page sequence="23">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 239 upon concepts in political economy that were close to but not identi- cal to those of Adam Smith, Sieyes was able to develop the idea that mutual exchange and the division of labor formed the basis, not only of society, but also of political representation. Although Sieyes char- acterized the Third Estate as a useful, "productive" class, in contrast to the idle, parasitical nobility, Sewell observes that many members of the Third Estate, in fact, were leisured rentiers themselves. Sewell also confronts the paradox posed by Sieyes, who demanded the abo- lition of privilege as the foundation of the political community, but simultaneously enjoyed corporate prerogatives through his position in the church. Sewell observes that Sieyes's intense hatred of the nobility stemmed from frustrations in his early career when he was repeatedly passed over for promotion in the church in favor of those with more distinguished social pedigrees. Sewell further speculates that Sieyes, as well as other radical deputies, suffered from a kind of "amnesia" that prevented the deputies from foreseeing the drastic consequences that the abolition of privilege concretely entailed. In his own mind, Sieyes believed that clerical privileges were justified as a reward for profes- sional service, while noble privileges were merely transmitted by birth and had no necessary connection to useful employment. The most fascinating chapter of this book is undoubtedly the fifth, "What Is the Citizen?" Here Sewell reveals the contrast between the egalitarian rhetoric of VVMat Is the Third Estate? and the troubling de- nial of political equality present in Sieyes's private papers. In What Is the Third Estate? Sieyes made mutual exchange and productivity the criterion for citizenship, a standard that implied the absence of overt subordination. In other writings, however, Sieyes implied that politi- cal representation should be limited to the "available" classes (classes disponibles) whose wealth could free them from the drudgery of work and give them the leisure to engage in public affairs. At one point Sieyes even fantasized that other races, "anthropomorphic monkeys" supervised by Negroes, might be enlisted to perform the menial labor necessary for economic development and leisured white citizenship. Ultimately, Sieyes found it impossible to define a suitable, standard measure for citizenship. He believed that moral and civic qualities like virtue, reason, and personal cultivation were necessary for partici- pation in government, but he realized that the possession of money, education, or property did not necessarily mean that a citizen actually possessed these internal values. In his final chapter, Sewell argues that although Sieyes launched the Revolution of 1789, it veered out of control in 1792 and took a di- rection that the former abbe found distasteful. The radical Revolution</page><page sequence="24">240 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES of 1792, Sewell states, employed the rhetoric of classical Republican- ism, whose "heroic vision" posed a stark contrast to Sieyes's efficient and self-interested reliance on political economy. Here Sewell conve- niently has some amnesia of his own. He reduces Sieyes's ideas only to the dispassionate rhetoric of political economy and never reminds us that both Sieyes and the radical revolutionaries appealed to the con- cept of will.26 Sewell's investigation of Sieyes could be deepened. Although the discourse of political economy looms large in his analysis, he does not refer to the wider scholarly literature in this field. Sewell is intrigued that Sieyes's terms fall completely in neither the Smithian nor the phys- iocratic camp. Here he might usefully have referred to the ground- breaking study of Simone Meysonnier who shows that there was an in- dependent kind of French economic liberalism predating physiocracy that placed great emphasis on natural sociability, reciprocal exchange, free contracts, state intervention, and the division of labor, all con- cepts central to Sieyes's thought.27 Sewell argues that texts should be placed in their social context, but he does not try to test his theory of the "rhetoric of amnesia" by searching for documents that would help to evaluate how deputies actually discussed the abolition of privilege after the night of 4 August. Nonetheless, Sewell does help us under- stand why the inauguration of modern citizenship was fraught with inconsistencies. He shows why 1789 could both release new possibili- ties for social justice to some and deny those possibilities to others. He challenges us to find ways to relate social practice to political culture. And he's fun to read. Because rights-bearing citizenship is a modern concept, many studies of citizenship are primarily concerned with problems associated with postrevolutionary citizenship, such as the inequities of capitalism, the denial of rights on the basis of race and gender, and nationalist separatism. I would like to conclude, however, by looking backward. How might the concepts of rights and citizenship challenge us to think differently about the origins of the French Revolution? A number of issues might be raised, but three are of particular interest because they currently play little role in macrointerpretations of the origins of the French Revolution. 26 Compare Sewell to Keith Baker's assessment: "Sieyes himself, no less than others, had laid the basis for the subversion of principles of constitutionality in the name of the general will that was implied in the Terror" (A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, ed. Francois Furet and Mona Ozouf, trans. Arthur Goldhammer [Cambridge, Mass., 1989], 321). 27 La Balance et ihorloge. According to Meysonnier, the French liberal tradition based upon the principle of mutual economic exchange placed more weight upon issues of social justice than did its English counterpart.</page><page sequence="25">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 241 First, the concept of citizenship recasts religion as a central issue in the study of the Revolution. Although there has been excellent monographic work on religion in the Old Regime, religion has little integral place in larger Marxist, revisionist, military-fiscal, or Haber- masian models of the origins of the French Revolution. Those interpre- tations see the Revolution as a reconfiguration of power set in motion by underlying events: notably economic power or great power politics. That mode of interpretation is important, but it does slant our atten- tion away from the actual redefinition of the state in 1789 to other more elemental structural factors. If we think of the Revolution as a radical transformation of the basis of national legitimacy and member- ship, however, religion becomes central to the story, because the state had traditionally been regarded as a politicoreligious concept. Reli- gion filled the public spaces of the Old Regime. Legitimate authority, it was repeatedly argued, came ultimately from God, and membership in the state was bound up with affiliation with the Catholic Church. Dis- lodging religion from society, removing the transcendental authority of God from the public sphere, was not a peaceful process. The very attempt to find a vocabulary of natural sociability, as we have seen, was crafted in part to find a solution to the problem of a state permanently divided by religion. Some of the most bitter battles of the Revolution were products of the attempt to reconfigure the relationship of reli- gion to the state. Second, if we wish to take rights seriously, we should also take law, in its broadest sense, seriously. Citizenship involved a profound transformation of the legal framework of society. There has been a strong tendency to see law as something that floats on top of more fundamental structures, such as the productive forces embedded in property relations and markets. But what is property without laws to define it and to stipulate who may own it, sell it, and inherit it? What is a market without laws that set the terms of contracts and monetary exchange? Our failure to see law as constitutive of the socioeconomic fabric of society is one reason that, following the demise of the Marx- ist interpretation, we have not been able to theorize the social content of the French Revolution. Legal relationships are not something that bob above more elemental social forces; they are part of those social structures themselves. The revolutionaries regarded the legal organi- zation of the Old Regime as unjust, inefficient, arbitrary, and divisive. Citizenship, with its power of sovereignty to make law and its rights to protect people from abuses of the law, was an attempt to make the legal framework more just, equitable, and predictable. The question of rights and citizenship does not really make any sense without the ad-</page><page sequence="26">242 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES mission that legal structures do shape people's opportunities in society and that those legal issues need to be addressed in their own right. Finally, the birth of modern citizenship was a transformation of the legal system of status. In the Old Regime, the three estates and other corporate bodies were not socioeconomic classes based in differing types of production; they were legal dtats, or what sociologists some- times term status groups. The e'tat of the Old Regime had two dimen- sions. The first aspect was a cultural definition of status by which vari- ous groups were ranked according to their dignity and honor. Honor stemmed from a number of sources, but the most important were birth and function. The norms governing the distribution of honor formed a system of social power analytically distinct from power derived through the control of economic resources. Status opened doors for those who met its cultural norms of dignity and placed obstacles in the way of those who did not. The accident of birth could bring a noble more honor than the efforts of the hardworking commoner, as Sieyes himself had found out. Citizenship involved transforming the basis for status, reorienting it away from aristocratic honor rooted in birth toward a meritocratic and civic definition of honor acquired through useful ser- vice to the state. The status system, however, was not merely a system of social snobbery writ large. Status had important political and legal aspects.28 Before the Revolution, political rights were supposed to be correlated with, or even derived from, social superiority. The social status enjoyed by the nobility or different corporate groups conferred privileges, lit- erally private laws, upon the members of each status group. Cultural norms of esteem were reinforced by political advantages: tax benefits, separate chambers for voting in the estates, different legal procedures, and so forth. By linking rights to concrete social situations, status in the Old Regime operated on principles antithetical to those of modern citizenship. Unlike the status hierarchies of the Old Regime, modern citizenship opened up the theoretical possibility of an abstract political sphere that had no necessary relationship to one's sociological situa- tion. By divorcing political rights from social status, citizenship opened up new possibilities for integrating diverse social groups into the state on the basis of equality. An exploration of the role of status in the Old Regime, therefore, is central to understanding not only the formation of social hierarchies, but also the dynamics of political power, includ- 28 The neo-Weberian sociologist Bryan S. Turner is reviving the political dimension of status in Status (Minneapolis, Minn., 1988).</page><page sequence="27">RIGHTS AND CITIZENS IN THE OLD REGIME 243 ing the explosive battles of 1789 between the nobility and the Third Estate, which ended by putting political power in the hands of citizens. In conclusion, the questions posed by the birth of modern demo- cratic citizenship in the French Revolution may provide new ways to rethink the relationship of political and social history in the French Revolution. Even if no great historiographical questions are unlocked, an approach oriented toward the issue of citizenship promises to help us understand more fully how the people in the Old Regime perceived the problems of their day and why they believed that a new kind of relationship to the state posed a partial, if not perfect, solution to the dilemmas they faced.</page></plain_text>
