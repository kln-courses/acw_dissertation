It remains to test alike Dr. Rivers' principles and his conclusions by applying them to other cultures. For some of them at all events we need have no fear of any such tests. Among such we may note, as one of the most striking and satisfactory results of his researches, the rehabili- tation of Morgan's theory that terms of relationship express real kinship, and are not empty terms of address. Dr. Rivers had put this forward in his lecture on Kinshzip and Social Organization, and has now worked it out more fully. Indeed the argument of the present work is based upon the correctness of the hypothesis. As a pioneer, of course, Morgan fell into many errors of detail: but he grasped the central truth which makes his work of permanent value. The so-called "classificatory system " is founded on the clan, and thus is brought into line with the conclusions of a school of anthropology which it is now the fashion to depreciate. It is only too probable that those conclusions, as research progresses, will have to be modified in various particulars. Many of them were doubtless too hasty; they were based on unwarranted generalizations. But on the whole they seem likely to stand firm against objections based on a narrower outlook and more impatient inferences. The descriptive volume contains a number of excellent illustra- tions, both in the text and as separate plates, many of them from Dr. Rivers' own photographs. E. SIDNEY HARTLAND. ZEUS, A STUDY OF ANCIENT RELIGION. By ARTHUR BERNARD COOK. Vol. I.: Zeus of the Bright Sky. Cambridge, at the University Press. 19I4. Medium 8vo, pp. xliii+885. THE ASIATIC DIONYSOS. By GLADYS M. N. DAVIS. Pp. x+ 276. London, G. Bell &amp; Sons, Ltd. I914. MR. COOK'S great monograph on Zeus, of which only the first volume has as yet been published, will have special interest to our Society, because some of the preliminary studies on which 220</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. it is based appeared in these pages under the title of "The European Sky God." 1 "I had meant," he tells us in his Preface, "to go further along the same road. But at this point Dr. Farnell in the friendliest fashion put a spoke in my wheel by convincing me that the unity of an ancient god consisted less in his nature than in his name. Thereupon I decided to abandon my search for 'The European Sky God.' . . . After some hesitation I resolved to start afresh on narrower lines, restricting enquiry to the single case of Zeus." The result of this change of method is that we now possess a detailed investigation of a single mythological problem, carried out with that wealth of learning and vigour of thought which we are accustomed to expect from the Cambridge school of anthropology and folklore. The Syndics of the University Press have liberally undertaken to publish the work in fitting style, and this volume, with its numerous fine illustrations and excellent typography, makes a splendid book. Naturally, the monograph owes its origin to the impulse of The Golden Bo/ogh, but Mr. Cook does not agree with many of Sir James Frazer's conclusions, and the general outlook of the two writers on the question of religion is very different. Mr. Cook distinctly avoids the "use of ethnology as a master-key to unlock the complex chambers of Greek religion," and he urges that "analogies drawn from a contiguous area are much more likely to be helpful than analogies gathered, sometimes on doubtful authority, from the ends of the habitable earth." He will not accept the theory advanced in The Golden Bough that Zeus was named " Bright" as being an oak-god, the wood of the tree being used for fire-making. He recognises in Zeus Lykaios a god of light, not a wolf-god. He rejects Sir James Frazer's account of the relation of magic to religion, denying that magic everywhere came first, religion second, the latter being directly due to the unmasking of the former. "The baffled magician," he argues, "would most plausibly account for his failure by attributing it to the counter-charms of some rival practitioner on earth, say a neighbouring chief, or else to the machinations of a ghost, say a dead ancestor of his own. Why should he-how could 1 Folk-Lore, vols. xv., xvi., xvii., xviii. (I904-1907). 221</page><page sequence="3">Reviews. he-assume a sky-god, unless the sky was already regarded as a divine Potency? And if this was the case, then religion was not subsequent to magic, but either prior to it or coeval with it." This is not the place to discuss serious questions like these, but it is hardly necessary to remark that there is no real conflict between these two scholars. "It was Sir James G. Frazer," writes Mr. Cook, "who first advised me to put together in permanent form the materials that I had collected; he has seen about a third of the present volume, and though well aware that I differ from him on certain vital issues, he has with characteristic generosity more than once encouraged me to persist in my undertaking." It is premature to discuss this book in detail until the second volume, which promises to be the more interesting of the two, is published. It will be sufficient to say that up to this point of his journey Mr. Cook arrives at the following conclusions: Zeus, whose name means "the Bright one," was originally conceived in zoistic fashion as the bright sky itself; the change from the zoistic to the anthropomorphic Zeus was occasioned, not by any despair of magic, but rather by a naive attempt to express heaven in terms of earth. The divine dark sky, as supreme weather- maker, was represented under the guise of an ordinary magician or weather-ruling king. Besides this, Zeus was brought into connexion with every celestial luminary, but genuine Hellenic religion never identified Zeus with sun or moon or stars. Again, the conception of him as a procreative god appears in great prominence, and as sky-father he is in essential relation to an earth Mother, or to a goddess like Demeter, an earth Mother that has developed into a vegetation goddess. The book on the Asiatic Dionysos stands in a different class. The writer adds a good knowledge of Sanskrit to that of Greek, and her main thesis is that Dionysos is identical with the Vedic Soma. A reaction is now setting in against what M. Salomon Reinach called le mirage Oriental, and the modern school of mythologists having disposed of the theory of Babylonian influence on Greek belief will hesitate to accept the theory of direct, exten- sive borrowing from the Hindus. They look forward rather to the decipherment of the Minoan records to show that Greek cults and 222</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. beliefs were largely derived from that culture. It is possible, of course to trace, as Miss Davis does with elaborate detail, numerous anologies between the doctrines of Greek philosophers, notably Plato, and those of Indian thinkers. This review of what she calls 'Asianism in Ancient Greece" is valuable even if we are not pre- pared to believe that it is due to direct borrowing from Eastern sources by Greek thinkers. At present, most people are satisfied to accept a Thrako-Phrygian origin of Dionysaic worship, and the difficulty in the Indian theory lies in the question of the mode of transmission. In early days the road was barred by Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites or Phrygians, and the evidence of communica- tion between Greece and India through the Persians does not seem quite satisfactory. Although the main thesis which Miss Davis supports may not meet with general acceptance, the wide learning and ingenuity displayed in this book establish her claim to be regarded as a valuable recruit to the ranks of students of Comparative Religion.

THIE first volume of this valuable collection of Sitihalese folk-tales has already been reviewed in these pages.' The work is now completed by the publication of these volumes. The contents are arranged partly according to the classes of the population among whom the tales are current, partly by locality. The second volume is devoted to "Stories of the Cultivating Caste," which are con- tinued in the third volume. This also includes "Stories of the Lower Caste " and " Stories of the Western Province and Southern India," with some texts in Sinhalese as examples, and additional notes and corrections. Each volume is provided with an excellent index by means of which parallels to the incidents can be traced. 1 Folk-lore, xvii., 123 ff. 223 2</page></plain_text>
