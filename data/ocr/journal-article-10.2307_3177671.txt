<plain_text><page sequence="1">NO MORE WAR: AN ART ESSAY INTRODUCTION by Josephine Withers Just as women of this century have been prominent in the peace movement, they have also made war's brutality the subject of their art. One of the best known protests against war, Nie Wieder Krieg, on our cover, was created by Kaithe Kollwitz (1867-1945) in 1924. From her earliest print series in the 1890s, Kollwitz was well known as an artist of social protest. It was only during the First World War, however, that she became firmly committed to pacifist causes in the wake of her son's death on the German front in 1914. Begin- ning in 1915, she often quoted in her diaries Goethe's eloquent phrase from Wilhelm Meister, "seed for the planting shall not be ground up." Kollwitz used this as a title in at least three prints during her life, and in an open letter protesting the killing, pub- lished in the Vossische Zeitung in 1918. In the same year that she created the Never Again War poster, she published a series of seven woodcuts simply called War. In a letter to Romain Rolland of October 1922, she wrote that she wanted the prints to travel around the world: "This is how it was-this is what we have borne during these unspeakably bad years."i Nie Wieder Krieg was commissioned by the organizers of Ger- man Youth Day, an annual observance of the beginning of World War I; the youth day was meant to introduce young people to the pacifist sentiments existing among the workers and the military. Kollwitz observed in her diary, "the idealism and readiness for sacrifice of young people should not be turned toward war, but toward building a better life and society."2 The expressive energy of this poster was based on Kollwitz's past experiences of the war. The urgent message, however, was directed to the present, which already was witnessing the corrosion of the Versailles Treaty, the political and financial instability of the Weimiar Republic, and the beginnings of the German rearmament. In the 1930s, Kollwitz became persona non grata to the Nazi regime; she experienced difficulty in exhibiting her work, some of which was burned as</page><page sequence="2">Josephine Withers 77 "degenerate," and she was threatened with concentration camp in- ternment. Mine Okubo actually did experience internment at the hands of the American government, to whom she was known as citizen 13660. Okubo was born in Riverside, California, in 1912 and at the age of thirty was swept up in the racist paranoia directed toward Americans of Japanese heritage. Following the directives of Executive Order 9066, one hundred and ten thousand Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, seventy thousand of whom were American citizens, were rounded up and sent to prison camps in remote desert or mountain areas. Okubo's experience was typi- cal of many families and points up the government's schizophrenic attitude. Although her older brother was one of the first men to be drafted in her hometown, her foreign-born father was sent to a special camp for issei in Montana, and later Louisiana. Her sister was sent to Wyoming, while Okubo and her younger brother were sent to one of the largest camps, in Topaz, Utah.3 While the Japanese did not suffer the physical brutality and liquidation experienced by the Jews and other inmates of the German camps, they were uprooted from their communities, possessions and property were confiscated or sold at a fraction of their value, and they endured the humiliation of being regarded as traitors, without, however, actually being charged. Okubo ob- served, "the impact of evacuation is not on the material and phy- sical plane. It is something far deeper. It is the effect on the spirit. What hurts most was the idea of being segregated and put away in a camp completely divorced from the national defense effort."4 Another inmate, a young man, spoke of the shame they all shared. "We were like the victim of a rape-we could not bear to speak of the assault, of the unspeakable crime. Thus for many years we had not even spoken of our imprisonment." The long-term effect of this imprisonment "was a loss of self-confidence and self-respect, a generation of Americans who wrongly suffers a sense of guilt and shame."s5 Okubo's art, which had been powerfully influenced by the Mex- ican muralist and revolutionary artist, Diego Rivera, records the pain and difficulties of the prisoners, and their struggle to keep some semblance of community and familial cohesion and support. Unlike the artists of Theresienstadt, Okubo's art was not banned; of the two thousand paintings and drawings done at Topaz, many were published in the camp's literary magazine, Trek, which she helped found. Immediately after the war, approximately two hundred of these drawings were published under the title Citizen 13660.6</page><page sequence="3">78 Josephine Withers The photographer Dorothea Lange (1895-1965) had a unique opportunity to document the evacuation and internment of the Japanese Americans. Not unlike the Nazis, with their obsessive interest in documenting their own most gruesome acts, the Amer- ican government, through the agency of the War Relocation Authority, commissioned Lange to record the camps. From the point of view of progovernment propaganda, Lange was a curious choice. She had previously been commissioned by the Farm Secur- ity Administration to photograph the people and places of Arkan- sas and Oklahoma desolated by the depression and the dust storms. The results, published in 1939 as An American Exodus: A Record of Human Erosion, with accompanying text by her husband, Paul Taylor, is considered a classic study of the social and psychological trauma of that period. Lange's Migrant Mother of 1936 is particu- larly celebrated, and, like Kollwitz's Never Again War, has become part of our collective consciousness: both are a part of what we know to be true for that period in history. It should be no surprise, then, that Lange would have approached her subject with great empathy and sensitivity. Her photographs re- cord not only the reactions of these Americans to this unexpected and unwarranted degradation, but also show their boarded-up stores and abandoned homes. Some of these photographs were published in 1972 under the appropriately laconic title, Executive Order 9066. Margaret Bourke-White (1906-1971) also came to maturity just before the depression, a fact which was equally significant for her artistic and social vision. Also like Lange, one of her first major projects as a photojournalist was a documentation of the grinding poverty experienced by sharecroppers in the rural South. These photographs were published with Erskine Caldwell's text, You Have Seen Their Faces, in 1937. In 1936, Bourke-White was to do the first cover for Life magazine, and through this association became one of the world's top photojournalists. She recorded the war in Russia, Italy, and Germany, and was with General Patton when he discovered the dead and dying of Buchenwald; he ordered the townspeople from nearby Weimar to witness the Nazi horrors, which they claimed, "We didn't know, we didn't know." When Bourke-White was recording these just-discovered atrocities, she appears to have never flinched or pulled back. It was only later, looking at the newly developed pictures that she wept and was unable to go near them for some days. Nancy Spero's Bomb series, begun in 1966, came from an alto- gether different place than Bourke-White's stark historical record. While- Bourke-White's photographs were created for a mass audi- ence, Spero's horrifying anthropomorphic bombs remained essen-</page><page sequence="4">Josephine Withers 79 tially private throughout the Vietnam War. Between 1951, when Spero graduated from art school, and 1964, when she returned to America after five years of living in Paris, she painted large-scale more-or-less abstract pictures; angry, existential, and expressive, she has called them, but not political. Her bombs erupted in 1966, multiple "MIRV" penises spraying in all directions, monsters shit- ting bombs, primitive insect-like helicopters either strafing or suck- ing up dead bodies. Spero has observed that the series is very sexual in its implications of power. The figures are not erotic at all. It has to do with power and rape. The bomb images are essentially male and phallic. I made female bombs, too, for one can't separate certain characteris- tics in the sexes even though men are more powerful on a worldwide scheme of things.7 At that time, Andy Warhol's soup cans and Kenneth Noland's cool stripe paintings were the apparent antipodes of the New York art world. Art and politics were not considered appropriate bedfellows, and Spero's rageful images found no public audience at that time. Since then, her series on Artaud, The Torture of Women, Chile, and Hours of the Night, have had steadily increasing exposure. Along with this more recent work, the Vietnam Bomb series, which is so prescient in its subject and its level of anger and violence, is finally being seen by a wider audience.8 May Stevens, of the same generation as Spero, declares "art is political." All art, she writes, "can be placed somewhere along a political spectrum, supporting one set of class interests or another, actively or passively, at the very least supporting existing condiitons by ignoring other possibilities, silence giving consent."9 She could have been referring to Warhol or Noland, whose works, to judge by their high prices, give silent assent to their corporate patrons. Ste- vens's art is both personal and political, and as with most artists, her antiwar statements grow out of a larger concern with the de- struction of the collective and individual body and spirit which war is. Stevens's statement of the personal as political is typified by three people who regularly figure in her art: her mother, Rosa Luxemburg, and her father, partly reincarnated as Big Daddy. In 1972 she published a book, Ordinary/Extraordinary, a pictorial homage to her mother and Rosa. Her father is said to have inspired the highly particular and altogether typical features of Big Daddy, who made his first appearance in the late sixties as the satirical Big Daddy Paper Doll with interchangeable costumes. Combined with the flag, Big Daddy and his metamorphosed look-alike bulldog took on a more sinister and ambiguous meaning in the paintings of the early seventies. There is a large-scale, primary-color clarity</page><page sequence="5">80 Josephine Withers about Stevens's Big Daddy series that would appear to put them more squarely in the realm of propaganda art than the "crazy scratchings" of Nancy Spero. But as Stevens has observed, "the meaning of art cannot be reduced to propaganda; it deals with many other things in addition to those revealed by class and sociological analysis."'1 The last painting illustrated here, World War II by Audrey Flack, whose work was featured in the previous issue of Feminist Studies, is not a protest painting as such. With Margaret Bourke-White's photograph of The Living Dead of Buchenwald as its most promin- ent feature, it is a memorial to those dead; the candle wax dripping on the picture-within-a-picture puts a certain distance of time and space between us and the immediacy and horror of the historical event. As is suggested by the title of the series, Vanitas, it is a meditation on man's inhumanity.
