COMPARATIVE LITERATURE SECTION [Attendance: 300] 9:30 A.M.-12:30 P.M. Chairman, Professor W. P. FRIEDERICH of the University of North Carolina; Secretary, Professor E. D. SEEBER of Indiana University. Advisory and Nominating Committee: the chairmen of the seven Comparative Literature Discussion Groups. 1. "National, General, and Comparative Literature." By Profes- sor RENA WELLEK of Yale University. [Comparative Literature is commonly confined to the study of literary relationships be- tween two or more literatures. But such a limitation is unsatisfactory. No distinct subject with a distinct methodology can emerge from such fragments. It would be restricted to external problems of sources and influences, reputation and fame. Comparative Literature is best con- ceived as a synthetic view of literature without undue regard to overrated linguistic distinc- tions. The history of ideas, themes and forms, devices and genres, is an international history. The study of national literature is not, however, slighted: precisely the problem of nationality and the contribution of each nation to the general literary process is a central problem of com- parative literature.] 2. Business. a. Report of the Nominating Committee and elections. b. Professor Chandler Beall, University of Oregon, presented a plan for the publication of a journal of comparative literature to be sponsored jointly by the University of Oregon and the Comparative Literature Section. Professor Lange, Cornell University, reported for the journal committee of the Section. 3. "Story-Writers and Story-Tellers." By Professor STITH THOMP- SON of Indiana University. [Specialized investigations in the field of literature and the appreciation and enjoyment of literature are considered as complementary and not antagonistic activities. Research in oral tales, for example, is complementary to the study of literary fiction. Importance of folktales in the history of narrative art. Some of the principles governing the study of folktales.] 4. "The Responsibility of Scholarship in the World Crisis." By Professor NORMAN FOERSTER, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. [The period of scholarship now drawing toward a close has been sustained by the national- istic and scientific movements of the nineteenth century. A new type of scholarship seems called for, not only reflecting certain changes in the intellectual climate, but also serving in the effort to achieve a new cosmopolitan order. Of this responsibility one recognition is the fresh interest in comparative or international literature.] 1948 Officers: Chairmat, Dean Stith Thompson, Indiana University; Secre- tary, Professor W.

GERMANIC SECTION [Attendance: 400] 2:30-5:30 P.M. Chairman, Professor HELMUT REHDER of the University of Illinois; Secretary, Professor CARL F. BAYERSCHMIDT of Columbia University.

By Professor BAYARD QUINCY MORGAN of Stanford University. [Theorem: Germans have a distaste for formal restrictions. Cor. 1: The forms they create tend to be fluid.

Significant affirmations of form.] 1215</page><page sequence="6">1216 Modern Language Association 2. "Zur Literaturgeschichte des deutschen Mittelalters."

Von den Wurzeln altdeutschen Schrifttums. Der christliche Heliand und der deutsche Krist Otfrids von Weissenburg. Zum Verstaindnis der Form in "friihmittelhochdeutscher" Zeit. Die Umdatierung des Rolandslieds und ihre Folgen. Das Problematische in Hartmanns Werk. Jiingste Wolframforschung. Gottfrieds Tristan und die mittelalterliche Mystik.] 3. "Recollection and Reality in Carossa's Autobiography." By Professor ERICH HOFACKER of Washington University. [The transforming power of memory which sifts and refines the experience of past reality Into the essence of poetry can be traced, in its beginnings, in Carossa's narrative itself. Subtle recollection of former experiences is felt to be the innermost bond between various stages of his early development. Among the symbols marking these stages the manger and the propylaeum are of special significance.] 4. "The Literary Work of Albrecht Haushofer." By Professor ADOLF E. ZUCKER of the University of Maryland. [Albrecht Haushofer (1903-1945) was professor of geopolitics at the University of Berlin, but, in contrast to his father, Carl Haushofer, an ardent opponent of the Hitler regime. He worked toward Its overthrow in association with the leaders of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt and was put to death by the Gestapo the very day the Russian army entered Berlin. He considered himself a geographer, but he also published six remarkable belletristic works. His five historic dramas in blank verse follow in the tradition of Schiller, Kleist, and Hebbel and show a profound historic insight, as well as the ability to create living characters endowed with poetic eharm: Scipio (1934), Sulla (1938), Augustus (1941), Die Makedonen, and Chi- nesische Legende: the latter two still unpublished. Just as in his lectures at the University so in his dramas Haushofer presents in historic guise his criticism of the Nazi regime. His crowning works are the eighty Moabiter Sonette, written in prison and presenting in marvelous poetic form the author's profoundest feelings and thoughts.] 5. "Die Insel als Symbol in der deutschen Literatur." By Profes- sor BERNHARD BLUME of the Ohio State University. [Das in der neueren Literatur immer wiederkehrende Erlebnis menschlicher Isoliertheit hat in der Insel ein bezeichnendes Symbol der vom Ganzen abgetrennten Existenz gefunden. An einer Reihe charakteristischer Gestaltungen dieses Symbols, vom 6.

MONDAY EVENING THE evening was devoted to a Business Meeting of the Associ- ation beginning at 8:00 P.M., followed by a General Meeting (open to the public) beginning at approximately 9:00 P.M. BUSINESS MEETING The Association convened in the Ballroom of the Hotel Statler at 8:00 P.M. for a Business Meeting, President T. Moody Camp- bell presiding. Approximately 300 members were present. The reports of the Secretary, Treasurer, Auditing Committee, and Trustees (printed on pages 1244--59) were presented and accepted. Informational reports by the Committee on Photo- graphic Reproductions, the Commission on Trends in Educa- tion, and the Delegates to the American Council of Learned Societies (reports printed on pages 1260-64) were presented by Professor William C. Holbrook, Dean Henry Grattan Doyle, and Professor Sturgis E. Leavitt. 1221</page><page sequence="12">Modern Language Association The Constitution, Article III (Membership), was amended to read as follows: 1. Any person approved by an officer of the Association may become a member on the payment of a sum currently fixed in the By-Laws [instead of five dollars] and may continue a member by payment of the current dues [instead of the same amount] each year. 2. Any person eligible to membership may become a life member and exempt from dues by a single payment of twenty times the annual dues [instead of one hundred dollars] or by the payment of seven times the annual dues through [instead of thirty-four dollars for] three successive years. This amendment, approved at the 1946 meeting to permit action an- nually on the matter of dues, had to be accepted "at two successive Annual Meetings" in order to become valid (under Article VII): By-Law VII (Budget) was amended by the addition of a sec- ond paragraph reading, "The annual dues shall be five dollars," and by the alteration of "laid before" to "available to." The first change was made necessary by the above amendment of the Constitution; the second was to regularize the practice of not reading at the Business Meeting the entire Treasurer's Report. On recommendation of the Committee on Honorary Members and on nomination by the Executive Council the following dis- tinguished foreign scholars were elected Honorary Members of the Association: RICHARD IRVINE BEST, Professor in The Institute for Advanced Studies, Dublin; Director, National Library of Ireland; President, Royal Irish Academy; editor and translator of Middle-Irish texts, including Book of the Dun (1929), Ancient Laws of Ireland (1931), and Bibliography of Irish Philology (1942). SIGURDUR NORDAL, since 1918 Professor in the University of Iceland; Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard, 1931-32; editor of publications of the Old-Icelandic Text Society and of two volumes of Monumenta Typo- graphica lslandica; author of The Saga of St. Olaf (1914), Snorri Sturlleson (1920), Graskinna (four volumes, 1928-36), Islenzkmenning (vol. I, 1943, three more volumes to appear). CHARLES JASPER SISSON, Professor in the University of London; author of Le Gout public et le theatre lizabethain (1922), Shakespeare in India (1926), Thomas Lodge and Other Elizabethans (1933), Lost Plays of Shakes- peare's Age (1936); co-editor of Modern Language Review. The Secretary announced the results of the 1947 postcard Ballot. Exactly 2489 valid ballots were received (in 1946, slightly more than 2000; in 1945, 1700). There were elected to the Executive Council: Bayard Q. Morgan, Stanford University Austin Warren, University of Iowa Stanley T. Williams, Yale University Professor Williams received 899 votes. The runner-up, Professor Margaret Gilman, received 734 votes. The Committee on Nomination of Officers-Professors Rich- ard F. Jones (Ch.), William C. DeVane, Clarence H. Parmenter, Taylor Starck, and Ira O. Wade-then presented the following nominations: President: Professor Percy Waldron Long, New York, N. Y. First Vice-President: Professor George Sherburn, Harvard University. 1222</page><page sequence="13">Proceedings of the Association Second Vice-President: Professor Orie W. Long, Williams Col- lege. As this election is held by ballot, the Secretary was instructed to cast one ballot in favor of these nominees, and did so. There being no new business, the Committee on Resolutions- Professors Victor Lange (Ch.) and Thomas R. Palfrey-then reported as follows: 1. On the occasion of its sixty-second annual meeting the Modern Language Association of America acknowledges its deep obligation to the local committee, composed of representatives of the Detroit Public Schools, the University of Detroit, Michigan State Normal College, Michigan State College, the Univer- sity of Michigan, and Wayne University, for the care and effort expended in overcoming the many difficulties attendant upon a meeting held in a large and crowded city. Keenly aware of the time and trouble involved in making such eminently satisfactory arrangements for the conduct of the Association's busi- ness and for the individual comfort of its members, the Association offers this expression of its appreciation to the local committee and to the management of the Hotel Statler for its generous participation and cooperation. 2. The Modern Language Association of America wishes to express its recog- nition of the distinguished work of its Secretary, Professor Percy W. Long, who retires after thirteen years of devoted service. The period from 1934 to 1947, during which he held office, has been charged with the uncertainties and troubles of our times, and it is due in the main to his wise and resolute guidance that the Association has so conspicuously gained in intellectual and material strength. Since he took office, the number of our members has increased by more than a thousand; he has raised almost $80,000 in aid of publication; the ever larger annual meetings have been arranged with unfailing success; the scope of cooperative scholarly enterprises has become more effective; the quality of our publications has been maintained on an impressive level-these are some of the visible results of his labors. His leadership and skill in coping with administra- tive tasks of increasing complexity, but most of all his loyalty to the ideals of scholarship and teaching, will be warmly remembered. The indebtedness of the Association for Professor Long's devotion to its welfare cannot be fully con- veyed; but in order that it be recorded in the pages of that journal to which he has as chairman of the editorial board given such care and affection, the Com- mittee wishes to give formal expression to the profound esteem and gratitude of all members of the Association for the service which he has so generously rendered. These resolutions were unanimously approved by vote of the Association, and the meeting was then adjourned by President Campbell. GENERAL MEETING [Attendance: 1000] 9:00-10:00 P.M. I.

Pope, Yale University; Alwin Thaler, University of Tennessee; B. J. Whiting, Harvard University. 1. "The Temper of Early Eleventh Century Culture in England." By Professor DOROTHY BETHURUM of Connecticut College. Dis- cussed by Professor HENNING LARSEN. [The high level of vernacular culture in England at the time of the Danish Invasion needs explanation. In Toynbee's concepts, were the incursions of the northern barbarians a stimulus to further advancement, or the death blow to a decaying system? They were the former, for the recrudescence of paganism called forth a response which effected the consolidation of all the gains promised by the early Benedictine reformers. The church was modernized and Roman- ised. The Carolingian idea of a Christian society was enlarged to take account of non-Christian members, and a changed concept of law appeared in the edicts of Aethelred and Cnut. Vernacu- lar sermons were fully developed on a pattern which does not appear until much later on the continent.] 2. "Chaucer's Pandarus, Virtuous Uncle and Friend." By Profes- sor EUGENE E. SLAUGHTER of Oklahoma Southeastern State College. [That Chaucer intended Pandarus's r61le as intermediary, uncle, and friend to be wholly commendable and ideal is evidenced by explicit statements in Troilus and Criseyde, by Chaucer's deviations from II Filostrato, and by his adherence to the doctrine of Roman de la Rose.] 3. "Tragic Retribution in the 1559 Mirror for Magistrates." By Professor WILLIAM PEERY of the University of Texas. Discussed by Professor ALLAN H. GILBERT. [Although the Mirror for Magistrates was no doubt Influential in imparting to Elizabethan tragedy its concepts of individual responsibility and tragic justice, this transmission is less simple than it has been made to seem. On reexamination, the majority of the nineteen tragedies in the original Mirror are seen to be, not primarily tragedies of retribution for sin or fault, but tragedies in which responsibility is so divided as to indicate that the 1559 Mirror is based on no single view of the cause of tragedy; rather it reveals evidences of an attempt to inject the retribution theme into a technique which traditionally stressed the Fortune thesis.] 4. "The Mirror for Magistrates and Sidney's Defense of Poesy." By Professor ALWIN THALER of the University of Tennessee. Discussed by Professor MERRITT Y. HUGHES. [Literary criticism-virtually unnoticed hitherto-in the Mirror unsystematically but substantially anticipates Sidney's Defense-which, significantly, praises the Mirror.] 5. "The Use of Rhetoric in the Rationale of Sixteenth-Century English Biography." By Professor ALBERT H. BUFORD of Fordham University. [Blunderville's Patrizi (1574), North's Plutarch (1579), Hayward's Henry IV (1599), and Bacon's The Advancement of Learning (1605) all pointed to the importance of the historian's making a distinction between history and biography on the bases of argument, manner, and use. Such a distinction recognized the importance of the subject's actions and provided for the emphasis that was assigned to the ethical import of the good and bad example.] 6. "Hamlet's 'god kissing carrion': a Renaissance Theory of the Generation of Life." By Professor JOHN E. HANKINS of the Univer- sity of Kansas. [Shakespeare's use of the phrase, "a god kissing carrion," in its context indicates his knowledge of Aristotle's theory that all life is a cycle of generation, corruption, and regeneration, together with Renaissance modifications of that theory. His reference to Ophelia immediately following shows his misanthropic disgust with mankind and with the physical processes that bring man forth, a state of mind resulting from much brooding on his mother's guilt.]</page><page sequence="15">Proceedings of the Association 1948 Officers: Chairman, Professor Baldwin Maxwell, University of Iowa; Secretary, Professor H.

[Of all characters in the scriptural account of the Passion, Pilate affords the best oppor- tunities for development. Two opposite conceptions of Pilate grew up, one picturing him al- most as a saint, the other as a fiend. Mediaeval dramatists lean towards the sympathetic treat- ment, though with some inconsistency caused by the legend of the evil Pilate. The Towneley Cycle has the most completely villainous of Pilates. He is a triumph of vivid characterization.l 2. "The Importance of Manuscripts for the Study of Mediaeval Education, as Revealed by the Learning of Chaucer." By Professor ROBERT A. PRATT of Queens College. [To understand and evaluate properly the educational and literary background of Chaucer it is necessary to turn to manuscripts of his time instead of to modern printed editions of classical and mediaeval texts. If the example of Chaucer is typical, then the effects of mediaeval education must be revaluated by the further study of the actual schoolbooks used in the Middle Ages.] 1229</page><page sequence="20">1230 Modern Language Association 3. "The Concept of Prefiguration in Certain Mediaeval Texts." By Professor ERICH AUERBACH of Cambridge, Mass. (Professor of romance philology, the University of Istanbul).

"Authorship and Redactions of the Old French Perceval Con- tinuations, with Some Remarks on the General Problem of Editing Old French Texts." By Professor WILLIAM J. ROACH of the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania. [In the process of publishing the Old French Perceval continuations, certain conclusions have been reached regarding the editing of mediaeval texts, the problems of authorship, the best method of presenting various pertinent materials in modern editions, etc. This paper sought to embody these conclusions.] 5. "The World, the Flesh, and the Devil." By Professor HOWARD MERONEY of Temple University. [The history of the "Three Foes" motif in Western Europe reveals its sources in Plato- nism, I John ii.16, and in a commentary on the temptation of Christ. The theme, based on a short list of vices (or peccata crimina) and independent of the Psychomachia tradition, was popularized by Cistercians and Victorines. This paper presented a critical survey of the theme in mediaeval poetry and drama, with a note on the causes of its decline in Protestant countries.] 1948 Officers: Chairman, Professor John Jay Parry, University of Illinois; Secretary, Dr. Curt F.

GUERARD of Harvard University. The discussion was opened by Professor MORTON D. ZABEL of the University of Chicago. [Andre Gide discerned in the novels of Conrad his own interest in the acte gratuit: the seemingly "pure," unmotivated or inexplicable action, which is nearly always self-destructive. Conrad did not dramatize "absurd suicide" (the suicide of Dostoevsky's Kirflov), and he paid little attention to neurotic behavior as such. He did examine, however, some of the grounds for apparently unmotivated behavior which also interested Gide: the compulsions of subconscious identification (L'immoraliste; Lord Jim, "The Secret Sharer"), the impulse to explore the hidden self (L* voyage d'Urien, L'immoraliste; "Heart of Darkness," "The Secret Sharer"), moral masochism (L'immoraliste, La Porte etroite, Les faux-monnayeurs; Lord Jim, Nostromo, Under Western Eyes, "The Secret Sharer," "A Smile of Fortune"). Conrad's final understanding of the obscure, inconsequent act was nevertheless very different from Gide's. It assumed an "original" human endowment (the longing for power, the longing for repose) which at any moment might break through the protecting surfaces of tradition, habit, and conscious mind. Gide, who remained faithful to his optimistic individualism, denied that human diversity could be reduced to such a bare formula. As psychologists Conrad and Gide had much in common; as moralists they reached opposite conclusions.]</page><page sequence="21">Proceedings of the Association 1231 2. "In Defense of the Term Romanticism." By Professor RENE WELLEK of Yale University. The discussion was opened by Pro- fessor RONALD S. CRANE of the University of Chicago. [In recent years, especially since Lovejoy's MLA paper on the "Discrimination of Roman- ticisms" (1924) and the widespread interest in semantics, terms of periods such as "Roman- ticism" have become more and more discredited and are used more sparingly. While one may grant many difficulties in the use of such terms, their total rejection seems undesirable. The view that such terms are purely arbitrary labels or even "fairy-tales" has led to a neglect of genuine and important problems of literary history such as the dominance of specific literary conventions at a given time or the anticipations and preparations for such a change. The aban- donment of these terms usually leads to an ignoring of the problems raised by them, and hence to the decline of synthetic literary history so noticeable today. Concepts of period are and will remain one of the main instruments of historical knowledge.] 3. "Sensational Psychology and the Rhetoric of Sensation in Jonathan Edwards." By Professor PERRY MILLER of Harvard Uni- versity. The discussion was opened by Professor THEODORE HORNBERGER of the University of Minnesota. [Jonathan Edwards discovered Locke's Essay while an undergraduate at Yale; he appro- priated it with an enthusiasm that is now difficult to understand, though the Lockean founda- tions for his metaphysics have been generally recognized. From starting points in Locke he also derived a coherent theory of literary expression, of which his sermons are the result. Accepting all the premises of sensational empiricism, Edwards nevertheless concentrated upon the Lockean concept of perception and made it serve purposes which in other circles equally indebted to Locke were seldom entertained. His theory was highly conscious, is a unique phenomenon in the American eighteenth century, and anticipates many positions that were later to be popularized by the Transcendentalists.] 4. "From Humour to Genius." By Professor EDWARD NILES HOOKER of the University of California at Los Angeles. The dis- cussion was opened by Professor BRICE HARRIS of Pennsylvania State College. [Changing concepts of humour, reflected in remarks by Congreve and Sir William Temple at the close of the seventeenth century, point towards the acceptance of Rugged Individualism, implicit in the character of The Humourist as it developed in the age of Pope. Parallel to this development we find such symptoms of dynamic individualism as Pope's exposition of the Ruling Passion, the belief that the doctrine of plenitude required unlimited diversification within the species, and the new concept of genius: all these leading to the view that no philosophical or moral system can adequately represent the infinite richness and admirable variety of human nature. Contemporaries tried to meet the disturbing implications of this psychological and social individualism by seeking bonds of union in a common cultural heritage (learning), in ideals of decorum imbedded in social codes (politeness), and in the small body of self-evident truths sup- posedly contained in the story of early societies and golden-age institutions (primitivism). The confusion wrought by the dilemma underlies Tom Jones, in which a thoroughgoing indi- vidualism sometimes appears as a virtue, sometimes as a folly-and sometimes as a disease, for which Fielding prescribes learning, religion, and sensibility.] 5. "The Meaning of Endymion." By Professor WERNER W. BEYER of Rutgers University. The discussion was opened by Professor RICHARD FOGLE of Tulane University. [Since the appearance of Mrs. Owen's study of Keats in 1880, most critics of Endymion have agreed as to its general drift but have differed in details of interpretation. Nevertheless, in the past (as again recently) a few commentators have sought to deny it symbolical meaning. New evidence as to the r61le that Wieland's Oberon played in Keats' poetical life greatly clarifies the genesis and meaning of Endymion and provides objective corroboration of the allegorical interpretation. The allusions, imagery, settings, and characters; the incidents, theme, and paral- lel structure of Endymion show that Oberon contains the key to Keats' conception. Innumerable similarities between the two poems-architectural, circumstantial, and thematic-not only indicate that Wieland's poem provided a pattern for Keats' romance, but also illumine the creative process and Keats' intended meaning. That Endymion concerns the visions, the spiritual and intellectual apprenticeship, the mission, and the love and apotheosis of its hero; and that it is an allegory of a poet's quest for spiritual perfection, highest happiness, and immortality in the unswerving pursuit of beauty, love, and truth-through a fourfold process of spiritualiza- tion-Oberon, Keats' chief source, makes obvious.] 1948 Officers: Chairman, Professor Samuel H.

By Professor HAROLD M. MARCH of Swarthmore College. 1237</page><page sequence="28">1238 Modern Language Association [Doubts about means and uncertainties about ends have led many scholars to return to old faiths (humanism, classicism, neo-scholasticism) or to embrace new approaches (psycho- analysis, criticism in terms of social significance). Another possibility has appeared: belief in a partial autonomy of art, which involves putting a higher valuation on art as an instrument of knowledge. Evidence from modern authors in support of this possibility.] 2. "The Social Sciences and Research in Romance Literatures." By Professor JOHN T. REID of the University of California at Los Angeles. Read by JOSEPH H. D. ALLEN of the University of Illinois. [Just as awe and respect for the exact sciences found their reflection in Romance literature of the eighteenth century, so the subsequent emphasis on social studies and problems has strongly influenced the content of modern literature and, tardily, the approach and methods of modern literary scholarship. A statistical survey of American research in the field of Hispanic letters during the last fifty years reveals a growing interest in the social content of the litera- ture, which, however, is often in conflict with the ideals and methods of the older conception of scholarship. In this paper, an effort is made to define the principal lines which research of the socio-literary type has taken, to evaluate severely such trends, and to suggest future fruitful methods. Examples are adduced principally from research in Spanish American literature.] 3. "Philology and Romance Philology." By Professor LEO SPITZER of the Johns Hopkins University. [The speaker called attention upon the fact that Romance Philology, itself a child of (Classical) Philology, has in the last fifty years developed away from the mother discipline, and, basing himself on specific experiences of his, he advocated a closer collaboration between the two branches.] 1948 Officers: Chairman, Professor Francis M.
