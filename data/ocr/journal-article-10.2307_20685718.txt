<plain_text><page sequence="1">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS: POETRY AND CULTURAL MEMORY IN BENJAMIN'S BAUDELAIRE INTERPRETATION Jennifer Bajorek Baudelaire would never have written poems if he'd had nothing more than the usual motives poets have for writing poetry. ?Walter Benjamin1 It is the singular achievement of Walter Benjamin's late texts on Baudelaire to have sketched for us one possible way that the subject might get through capital, one way that it (or "we") might move through the radical transformations of the structures of expe rience and memory that capital entails. I say these texts sketch one possible way we might "get through" these transformations, if not exactly survive them, in order to underscore the difference between the time of this process and any forward movement. As is well known, Benjamin based all of his theoretical calculations in the texts of this period on the necessity of breaking with the theo ry of history as a theory of progress. He saw this break as necessary on account not only of certain tendencies of fascism and of what he called "bourgeois habits of thought," but of the theoretical instruments of Marxism itself, which he had begun to suspect were Qui Parie, Vol. 16, No. 2 Spring/Summer 2007</page><page sequence="2">98 JENNIFER BAJOREK all too reflexively intertwined with their object. The break was not only necessary but perceived as urgent and had to be total, requir ing nothing short of a new theory, not just of history, but its stuff. Critical to the formulation of this break and to the formation of this new historical material was a theory of poetry and, more specifi cally, Baudelaire's poetry, on which Benjamin came to base his most original and provocative claims about capital's history, as well as his speculations about the shape of its future, even if these remained fragmentary. We cannot know whether this fragmentari ness stems from the radical incompletion of Benjamin's writing projects (in the mundane sense allowed by biography), or from something about the nature of that future. Benjamin was not alone among his contemporaries in his call for a refinement of the instruments of historical materialism, nor was he alone in his articulation of this call with and through a pro ject of literary or cultural criticism: one that would register the imprint of historical events in linguistic terms and conceive of the collective and temporal dimensions of human experience in accor dance with textual models. The necessity of thinking a history that would not be colored by, or confused with, progressive and teleo logica! protocols was an impulse shared by other social and polit ical theorists of this period, and the textual sensibilities exhibited by Benjamin's "other histories" clearly anticipate those of later anti humanisms and deconstructions of the subject, even where these have been less explicitly concerned with the subject's imbrication with capital.2 My own interest in Benjamin's rethinking of history, to which alone his recent popularity and translatability outside the fields of philosophy and German literary studies can be attributed, lies not only in its overwhelming dependence on a theory of poet ry and on a specific poetic project (Baudelaire's) that was already calculated at the time of its writing as an intervention in collective experience, but also in that he had already discovered that capital called for a wholesale rethinking of history in its conditions and media of transmission.3 This essay will explore the consequences of Benjamin's extra ordinary investment in a specific poetic corpus for his larger theo</page><page sequence="3">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 99 ry of history, and it will venture a few tentative hypotheses about the poetic lapses and lacunae upon which Benjamin seizes in his interpretation of Baudelaire. It is difficult, for obvious reasons, to construct a history out of gaps, holes, omissions, or other forms of lapse and blankness, and yet this is, if we follow Benjamin, the materialist historian's task and even our own. Critical to our under standing of this task is, I will suggest, a deeper understanding of the task that Benjamin assigns to Baudelaire's poetry as a technology of memory that emerges under specifically capitalist conditions. One reason for exploring in greater depth Benjamin's description of this strangely intermittent technology is that it is directly connected with the prospect of a collectivity that would inherit and, in some sense if we follow Benjamin, be actively transmitted by capital's history. This brings us back both to the question of capital's future (what shape it will take and whether there will be anyone left to inherit it) and to a more nuanced understanding of why it is at least as urgent for us as it was for Benjamin to continue to think of cap ital as a problem, not merely of political economy (i.e., of uneven labor extraction), but of cultural and historical transmission. In the larger project from which this essay is drawn, I pursue a double reading of Baudelaire and Marx that takes its cue from Benjamin's so-called Baudelaire book.4Through his many disparate and fragmentary texts on Baudelaire, Benjamin was the first to sug gest that Baudelaire's and Marx's texts register traces of the same event: modernity conceived as a change in the nature and struc tures of transmission of experience; the mechanization of produc tion (be it of meaning or of value) or of human labor (manual or intellectual, virtual or embodied); the impact of all these things on our conception of history and on our experience of time and, at the limit, on anything that could still be called experience.5 But Benjamin was also the first to explore, in these same texts, the con nections between certain elements of literature or literary language and the conditions of a critical and ultimately deeply political response to capital. Benjamin was preoccupied, in his initial explo ration of these questions, with the figure of allegory, which becomes, in his texts on Baudelaire, the linguistic equivalent of the</page><page sequence="4">100 JENNIFER AJOREK commodity. In oblique relation to Benjamin's question about alle gory, and with a view to pushing his analysis of the connections between a specific literary or rhetorical technique and a critique of specific dimensions of capital still further, I ask about the social and political dimensions of irony. Why do Baudelaire and Marx, two consummate theorists of capital's interference at every level of human life, both feel compelled to theorize this interference in an ironic mode? What if irony cannot be confined to literature or to language but rather comes to inflect the production or circulation of all meaning or value under capital? If Benjamin sets out from the hypothesis that with Baudelaire we reach a "crisis of the lyric" and that the poet's texts "render the possibility of lyric poetry problematic,"6 my own intention is to demonstrate that there remain lessons to be drawn from their power to move through this crisis. Irony also names this situation of difficult transmission. For the purposes of this essay, irony will remain largely in the background, although I will suggest that it can't not inflect our efforts to think the collectivity that emerges under specifically capitalist conditions of memory and transmis sion: the collectivity re-membered, in Benjamin's account, by Baudelaire's poetic corpus. Irony is always there whenever we are brought to pay attention to our own ongoing participation in capi tal's history. Poetry at the Crossroads of Magic and Positivism At the time that Benjamin was writing, Theodor Adorno was sympathetic to and even shared Benjamin's concerns to elaborate a new materialist history from poetry, at least within certain limits. Some of these limits become legible in the infamous exchange in the 1938 correspondence, in which Adorno roundly condemned the draft du jour of the Baudelaire project ? even more roundly than he had condemned the previous draft, in 1935/Those famil iar with the exchange will recall some of Adorno's most scathing criticisms of Benjamin's engagement with Baudelaire: You have set yourself at the "crossroads of magic and positivism"; your method</page><page sequence="5">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 101 has deteriorated into the "wide-eyed presentation of mere factici ty"; you ascribe to mere "materialist enumeration" powers of illu mination that are "reserved to theoretical interpretation" alone.8 The list is remarkable in part because it reads like so many accu sations aimed at those of us in the humanities who remain stuck in the mundane opacities and resistances of the material objects of culture now that the theories to which they gave birth have migrat ed elsewhere, to greener pastures for grander claims about the prospects for radical social and political change than it seems can be sustained these days by the interpretation of literature or art. But my immediate reason for quoting Adorno's comments in this context is that they make clear the extent to which Benjamin was alone in his turn to this poetic corpus in order to ground his claims about our prospects for getting through capital. Even if Adorno was sympathetic to the special task that Benjamin assigned to Baudelaire's texts, his remarks signal that he misses something essential about the nature or texture of this task, hanging on, as he does in them, to the distinction between "materialist enumeration" and "theoretical interpretation" ? the very distinction that, on Benjamin's reading, Baudelaire's poetry breaks down. The claims that Benjamin makes for Baudelaire's poetry can be quite striking, even a little hyperbolic. But more striking than these claims is, I will suggest, the conception of poetry on which they hinge. I will suggest, in my reading of Benjamin, that something like a break down of this distinction between "materialist enumeration" and "theoretical interpretation" actually forms the linchpin of his argu ments about cultural memory and the changing conditions and media of cultural and historical transmission under capital. The precise nature of this breakdown or failure is best explored through his well-known argument about the shock experience.9 Indeed, we might borrow Benjamin's own language, from his own account of the psychic and historical structures reorganized by capital, in order to describe the effect of this lingering investment on Benja min's readers: It is as if the critic's decision with regard to this poet ry were itself a historical event that had left a memory trace in the psyche of his corpus; as if his decision to freight up his reading of</page><page sequence="6">102 JENNIFER AJOREK Baudelaire's poetry as a transmitter of capital's disruption of the conditions of collective experience had disturbed and reorganized the structure of that psyche in a way that all our chatter about the shock experience has thus far only tried to parry. Before turning to that theory in greater detail, we would do well to review one or two of the more general claims that Benjamin makes Baudelaire's poetry bear. Through motley drafts, revisions, phases, and thoroughgoing restructurings of their architecture, the myriad texts comprising Benjamin's Baudelaire interpretation are strung together by a single fil conducteur. This is the idea that capital touched Baudelaire's poetry, at the level not simply of its themes, but of its language, in the very way that it makes meaning or is made. It is, for Benjamin, in some sense always capital that produces Baudelaire's poetry. This idea, which is difficult to reconcile with conventional under standings of linguistic reference, requires that we grapple with Benjamin's description of the forking path taken by experience in the essay On Some Motifs in Baudelaire." There is, Benjamin writes, in Baudelaire's poetry "something of the isolated experience, or 'lived experience' [these are the two received translations of Erlebnis] to which Baudelaire has given the weight of a long experience [Erfahrung]" ("M," 343). At first glance, the reader might imagine, given this poetic freighting up of experi ence, that we are dealing with a Romantic conception of poetry as an exteriorization of an immediate and so-called lived experience proper to (and appropriated by) the subject conceived as a passage in or out of a space of radical interiority. Indeed, Benjamin cites Wilhelm Dilthey's influential book, Die Erfahrung und die Dich tung (Poetry and Experience), with reference to this tradition, for which the passage of experience into poetry and back again would require only a temporary mediation ("M," 314). But Benjamin's own deft manipulation of the distinction between the two different concepts of experience in German makes it clear that experience no longer refers, here, to a lyric or poetic expression that would be conceived as the mediation of a simple inside/outside structure. The entire "Motifs" essay attempts to demonstrate that Baudelaire's</page><page sequence="7">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 103 poetry, in stark contrast to Romantic tradition, derives its radical singularity from its power to record the accumulated weight of experience beyond the confines of a single psyche, consciousness, or subject and to transmit it, thus investing a radically collective experience with the longue dur?e of Erfahrung at the very moment that the recording or transmission of experience was becoming impossible ? that is, at the time of capital's industrial rise in the middle of the nineteenth century. According to Benjamin, this transmission is the secret of Baudelaire's success and why Les Fleurs du mal, which had very little prospect of success at the time that it was written, went on to acquire "the stature of a classic and become one of the most widely printed ones as well" ("M," 314). Benjamin gives this idea a first and still tentative formulation in the early pages of the "Motifs" essay, when he describes Baudelaire's poetry as "grounded in an experience [Erfahrung] for which exposure to shock [Chockerlebnis] has become the norm" ("M," 318). By the essay's end, he is considerably emboldened in his statement of this claim, writing that Baudelaire has succeeded in taking the isolated experience of shock (Chockerlebnis) and transforming it into a Chockerfahrung, that is, an experience of shock that would be transmissible to others and thus extend beyond this isolation. Baudelaire's poetry, Benjamin does not ultimately shy away from saying, has saved what had been, at the moment of its writing, lost to experience and transformed it precisely by transmit ting it, salvaging it for memory, for history, and for us. Given the extent of capital's interference, what this poetry transmits did not just risk being lost to experience in some acci dental sense but at a deeper level. Indeed, if we follow Benjamin's text to the letter, it was lost ? not only to the poet's own experi ence but to that of his contemporaries and, by dint of this failure of mediation, to history, until the poetry came along. Les Fleurs du mal has become a classic (i.e., mass-produced in all of the European languages) because of its power to save what had been lost to the individual psyche or subject and transmit it, thereby ren dering it a form of collective experience and ensuring itself, as a record of that experience, a future at the same time. Baudelaire's</page><page sequence="8">104 JENNIFER BAJOREK poetry is, in this account, a technology of memory, and a technol ogy, if not of mass production and technical reproducibility per se, then of the recording and transmission of an experience that was, thanks to capital, already becoming a mass experience, even as capital had deprived the mass of the urban population of the old conditions of experience (at least in Paris, the so-called "capital" of capital). That the loss of these conditions was not absolute and that the psyche could be reorganized in such a way as to support the development of new conditions for memory ? and therefore for experience ? is the first claim that Benjamin makes Baudelaire's poetry bear. This description of the poetic freighting up and transmission of experience plays an enormous part in Benjamin's more general understanding of experience or Erfahrung. Experience seems, by definition, to draw the individual into the collective and yet must be laid down in memory in order to do so ? even if it can only be laid down in memory, under capital or under modern conditions, at the expense of consciousness and accessibility to voluntary memory: "Experience is indeed a matter of tradition, in collective existence as well as private life. It is the product less of facts firmly anchored in memory [Erinnerung] than of accumulated and frequently unconscious data that flow together in memory [Ged?chtnis]" ("M," 314). On the one hand, this articulation of tradition and expe rience as an unconscious accretion or accumulation of data fits with a common understanding of tradition as a common good that is precisely not appropriable by a single subject (hence the meta phor of translation that frequently crops up). In every time and place and in every historical period, this deeper level of experience is, if we follow Benjamin, the only one that can sustain investment with the weight of tradition; it is the very stuff of cultural memory and collective experience. But Benjamin is concerned with a his torical shift, not only in the nature of tradition or of collective expe rience, but in the prospects for its emergence under capitalist con ditions. That experience is always "a matter of tradition," and there fore always collective, is not in itself historically specific or a mod ern phenomenon. What is historically specific, in Benjamin's</page><page sequence="9">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 105 account, is the power of capital to effect a falling-off or reduction in the range of possible objects or contents of collective experience ? as well as a reduction in the chances for, or frequency of occur rence of, the kind of collective experience that would be transmis sible, period, on any scale. For a sustained exploration of Benja min's concept of tradition, I refer the reader to Andrew Benjamin's lovely article on "tradition and experience," in which he suggests that it is not possible to understand Benjamin on tradition without first understanding his (ultimately more complex) arguments about memory, of which tradition is made.10 In my interpretation of Benjamin, I differ from Andrew Benjamin's account only where it concludes, on the basis of an interpretation of The Storyteller, that "The end of the story is the end of community" ("T," 125). It could be argued, as I believe this is Benjamin's own argument, that the end of the story is the beginning of poetry, and that part of what is at stake in the "Motifs" essay is the poetic rebirth of community. Forget the Usual Motives Enter the extended engagement with Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principle, which Benjamin deploys in order to radicalize this understanding of experience, or better, this understanding of the loss of experience as the price paid by the individual for his psychic integration (or disintegration) under capital. "Conscious ness," writes Freud, "takes the place of a memory trace [Das Bewu?tsein entstehe an der Stelle der ErinnerungsspurV ("M," 317). "Therefore," continues Benjamin, intricately beading togeth er a series of quotations not only from Freud, but Proust, Bergson, and Reik (from whose voices it can be difficult to discern his own): "'[l]t would be the special characteristic of consciousness that, unlike what happens in all other systems of the psyche, the excita tory process does not leave behind a permanent change in its ele ments, but expires, as it were, in the phenomenon of becoming conscious.' The basic formula of this hypothesis is that 'becoming conscious and leaving behind a memory trace are incompatible processes within one and the same system'" ("M," 317). This fun</page><page sequence="10">106 JENNIFER AJOREK damental incompatibility, between the emergence of conscious ness and the inscription of a memory trace, forms the pivot of Benjamin's shock theory, which holds that, under modern condi tions, the event undergone by the psyche is forced to take one of two paths: Wherever there is memory (i.e., wherever the event has happened in such a way that traces are recorded), there cannot be consciousness of the event. This lack of consciousness is the con dition of possibility of memory and thus of historical transmission under modern conditions. Conversely, wherever there is con sciousness, there can be no memory, and therefore no traces of the event, but only a parrying and blockage of durable experience. This parrying and blockage are the sign of the shock defense, whose sig nal achievement is "to assign an incident a precise point in time in consciousness" ("M," 317). One consequence of this fork in the road that experience must take under modern conditions is that vestiges of memory are "often most powerful and most enduring when the incident which left them behind was one that never entered consciousness" ("M," 317). In order for the most powerful and durable memory, and thus for history, to emerge in Benjamin's account, we need the shock defense to fail. Baudelaire's poetry is, for Benjamin, everywhere marked by the failure of the shock defense. Framed within a theory of memo ry and of the changing protocols of historical transmission (it is also, almost incidentally, a psychoanalytic theory), Baudelaire's poetry, even before Benjamin ventures an interpretation of a single line of it, is assigned a collective and historical task: Without Baudelaire's poetry, no history of the nineteenth century, and thus no document of the transformation of experience by capital: no saving and transmission of that history to us. Poetry is, in this account, a privileged and even the only possible form of collective or cultural memory for the subject of capital at the time of its indus trial emergence. Without poetry ? or, more accurately, without Baudelaire's poetry ? it seems there would be, for this subject, no experience; without the invention and intervention of this new technology of memory appropriate to modernity, there would be no history of the twentieth or even the twenty-first century: no us.</page><page sequence="11">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 107 The second claim that Benjamin makes for Baudelaire's poet ry is that this poetry dreams of capturing an experience that would "establish itself in crisis-proof form" ("M," 333). Like the claim that Les Fleurs du mal is essentially one big mass-produced palimpsest of modern experience, the claim that this poetry seeks to establish a "crisis-proof" experience holds out, once again, the promise of memory and historical transmission under seemingly impossible conditions. When conjugated with certain other claims that Benjamin makes for this poetry's privileged relation to the com modity, however, the claim for the establishment of a crisis-proof experience in poetic form lends to this poetry a highly specific intentionality. This intentionality is connected with the artwork, but with an artwork that has made its peace with the commodity, its political-economic anamorph. It is worth noting, before turning to Benjamin's description of this intentionality and of the linkage it must provide (between a poetry that would succeed in establishing a crisis-proof experience and a poetry that would be produced according to the laws or logic of the commodity), that this new technology of memory (Baudelaire's poetry) is marked by a radical dislocation of knowl edge. If we follow Giorgio Agamben's account of the destruction of what he calls "traditional experience," the disjunction between knowledge and experience performed by Baudelaire's poetry in Benjamin's account can in fact be understood as a return to or of a separation that was, once upon a time, constitutive of experience.11 (The disjunction between knowledge and experience can be corre lated with, even if it is not identical to, the disjunction between consciousness and memory just rehearsed. I will refrain from unpacking here the consequences of Agamben's decision to incor porate Benjamin's Baudelaire interpretation into a panoramic histo ry of philosophy from which capital is conspicuously absent.) Quite apart from whether we accept Agamben's description of an ancient separation between science and experience, mind and soul, nous and psyche, and thus, on the border of language and death, between human and divine knowledge ("IH," 19), his attention to a radical incommensurability of knowledge and experience embed</page><page sequence="12">108 JENNIFER AJOREK ded in the history of philosophy exposes the framework of a theory of history in which history necessarily emerges from, or as, a hiatus within consciousness or knowledge. In Benjamin's account, it is with the transmission of just such a hiatus that poetry is charged. Even if this hiatus is first identified with an ancient history and a deeply sedimented and (in Agamben's account) inaccessible tradi tion, however, it comes to be identified with the advent of moder nity. We thus find replicated in Benjamin's concept of experience ? and illuminated by Agamben's attention to the disjunction between knowledge and experience ? the communication or interp?n?tration of ancient and modern in a single topos, trope, or sign that is a signature gesture of Baudelaire's poetic project in Les Fleurs du mal, and above all of the poems of the Tableaux parisiens (of which Benjamin was, it cannot hurt to recall, the translator). But how, more precisely, does Benjamin tell us that the gar den of forking paths that threatens to suppress experience on two sides ? parrying or blocking it in consciousness or retaining it in memory only by virtue of a failure to register it on a conscious level ? comes to be legible in a poem? How does a poem or a poetic corpus signal its intention to get experience, under the threat of its permanent suppression, across? We might turn to one of the verse poems that Benjamin quotes at greatest length in the "Motifs" essay, Le Soleil, to explore at greater length how he derives his claims for this poetry's special intentionality with regard to its read ers and ultimately to the commodity.12 While he might have chosen other poems of Les Fleurs du mal that explicitly thematize poetic production as commodity production (such as La Muse v?nale), Benjamin prefers to read Le Soleil as the poem that will shed light on the conditions of production of Baudelaire's poetry: Le long du vieux faubourg, o? pendent aux masures Les persiennes, abri des secr?tes luxures, Quand le soleil cruel frappe ? traits redoubl?s Sur la ville et les champs, sur les toits et les bl?s, Je vais m'exercer seul ? ma fantasque escrime, Flairant dans tous les coins les hasards de la rime,</page><page sequence="13">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 109 Tr?buchant sur les mots comme sur les pav?s, Heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps r?v?s. Through decrepit neighborhoods on the outskirts of town, where Slatted shutters hang at the windows of hovels that shel ter secret lusts; At a time when the cruel sun beats down with redou bled force On city and countryside, on rooftops and cornfields, I go out alone to practice my fantastical fencing, Scenting chances for rhyme on every street corner, Stumbling over words as though they were cobble stones, Sometimes knocking up against verses dreamed long ago.13 In a loose analogy with Baudelaire's own description of his friend the painter Constantin Guys at work in his atelier (in The Painter of Modern Life), Benjamin introduces the poem's opening stanza as a depiction of the shock defense, thus installing the attempt to parry the blows of the shock, and thus the attempt to block the emer gence of experience, at the heart of Baudelaire's poetic project: "Baudelaire made it his business to parry the shocks, no matter what their sources, with his spiritual and physical self. This shock defense is rendered in the image of combat. In the opening stanza of Le Soleil, Baudelaire portrays himself engaged in just such fan tastic combat" ("M," 319). In truth, there is only a single word in the quoted lines that can be understood to indicate such a combat: This is the description of poetic composition as an escrime, or fenc ing match. But even if it attaches itself explicitly only to a single word, Benjamin's argument for the existence of a "traumatophile type" in Baudelaire's poetry ? the type of subject for whom con sciousness has intervened to parry the shock ? is convincing. Bolstering and even extending this interpretation is the fact that the sun's rays mercilessly beating down (Quand le soleil cruel frappe ?</page><page sequence="14">110 JENNIFER AJOREK traits redoubl?s) suggests a generally hostile environment and one inimical to poetic composition. But his decision to confine his interpretation of this image to the level of what is essentially auto biography does not advance us any further in understanding how we get from a simple self-portrait of the traumatophile to a more nuanced and more mediated recording and transmission of the shock experience (more nuanced and more mediated than straight autobiography) and one that would be specifically poetic.14 Le Soleil may show parrying, but does it also perform it? Looking more closely, we notice that Benjamin's interpreta tion of the poet-as-traumatophile overlooks and has the effect of occluding elements of Le Soleil that actually work to confirm many of the most compelling elements of his shock theory. For example, the inside/outside structure of the urban landscape, in which the speaking " is described as passing houses depicted as harboring secrets and closed and shuttered against the noonday sun, is almost immediately troubled by the fact that the sun does not seem to function as a condition of visiblity in these lines. The poet's task, and thus the work of poetic composition, is precisely noi to pene trate an interior (be it of a self or of others) from which he, like the sunlight, has been barred. The work of writing poetry is described as taking place in a liminal space and in a decidedly other place with regard not only to a shuttered interior but to any possible illu mination. Within this a-topic anti-enlightenment scene, the poet's stance may, to be sure, still be understood as combative: He may be mad and fighting demons (like the figure in Les Sept viellards, which Benjamin also mentions); or he may be fighting the sun in multiple senses (battling the heat but also working odd hours); or the combative stance of the poet figure may simply signify the dif ficulty of poetic labor. No matter which interpretation we may be inclined to give to this combat, however, none can account ade quately for the vexed relationship that poetic production bears to consciousness here, as exemplified by the encounter of the poet with the accidents of rhyme in the poem's remaining lines. Recall that the rhymes do not simply arrive by sheer happenstance of fl?nerie. Rather, they are depicted as bubbling up from the recess</page><page sequence="15">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 111 es of memory, or even as arriving, more obliquely ? and in a lit eral sense, given the explicit emphasis on distraction and stumbling in the stanza's closing lines ? by dint of memory's lapse. The richness and complexity of these stanzas' description of the poetic process cannot be overemphasized, nor can the reso nances between this depiction and Benjamin's description of the forking path taken by experience in the shock theory. If we empha size this encounter of labor with accident, and the central role with in the poetic process granted these rhymes tripped over, as the soli tary walker trips over paving stones, then the poet's combat does indeed seem fantastical or futile (ma fantasque escrime). The long sought verse appears to arrive as a distant memory, and as if by involuntary memory, but also by accident at the same time. Le Soleil suggests that the stuff of poetry cannot be conjured up from memo ry by sheer force of will, nor can it be produced by some other con scious process, but only involuntarily: by stumbling over words. We will return to this opaque field of stumbling blocks from which the lines of poetry are remembered. It is among other things a figure of our own participation, as readers, in the work performed by Baudelaire's poetry if it is to perform the work of collective or cultural memory in such a way that its history, the history of capi tal, will also be transmitted as our own. Still on the topic of Baudelaire's poetic process, we might turn to another passage, from another text by Benjamin, which puts this notion of a poetic lapse in contact with a slightly different account of Baudelaire's poetic process. In "Central Park," Benjamin writes about certain poetic secret weapons that Baudelaire is able to devise thanks to his "deep experience" (Erfahrung) of the commodity: Baudelaire's strategy in the literary market: through his deep experience of the nature of the commodity, he was enabled, or compelled, to recognize the market as an objective court of appeals (see his advice to young writ ers). Through his negotiations with editors, he was con tinuously in contact with the market. His techniques: defamation (Musset), and counterfeit (Hugo). Baude</page><page sequence="16">112 JENNIFER AJOREK laire was perhaps the first to conceive of a market-ori ented originality, which for that very reason was more original in its day than any other (cr?er un poncif). This cr?ation entailed a certain intolerance. Baudelaire wanted to make room for his poems, and to this end he had to push aside others. He managed to devalue cer tain poetic liberties of the Romantics through his classi cal deployment of the alexandrine, and to devalue clas sicist poetics through the characteristic ruptures and defects he introduced into classical verse. In short, his poems contained special provisions for the elimination of competitors ("CP/' 168). If we look closely at this passage, we see that Benjamin in fact switches gears in the middle of this explanation of what Baudelaire's poetry shares with the commodity. First, he supports the claim that Baudelaire was "the first to conceive of a market-ori ented originality" by citing the poet's famous remark about the desire or need to create a clich? (cr?er un poncif) as the hallmark of genius. He then switches to a different genre of evidence and example, drawn not, as we might expect, from the stock of images, clich?s, or tropes that might be offered as evidence of a market-ori ented originality (that is to say, an originality adapted to mass or technological production and thus no originality at all) but rather from the sphere of a-semantic poetic elements and above all meter. It is extremely interesting, but ultimately very difficult, to argue that a certain metrical tic, a given caesura, a given deploy ment of the alexandrine, assured the elimination of Baudelaire's competitors. This kind of argument can be very difficult to sustain, as can any argument about the origin or production of a poem in a-semantic elements of language, or for the intentionality of a poet ic project that would ground itself in a-semantic elements of lan guage, for much the same reason it gets tricky asking questions about the "meaning" of the occurrence of certain letters in a text ? the question to which we are always pushed by poetic rhythm or meter.15 This difficulty is not unrelated to the disjunction between</page><page sequence="17">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 113 knowledge and experience that Agamben traced in his essay on the destruction of experience (nor is it unrelated to what he calls infan cy), but it is even more important to note that part of what is at stake in this difficulty is that we need a different language to talk about the mass production and technical reproducibility of lan guage than we do to talk about such potentialities with regard to image technologies such as the lithograph, daguerreotype, or pho tograph.16 It remains a question whether Benjamin ever succeeds in developing such a language in any of his Baudelaire texts. Even in the absence of this language, however, his remarks about the imprint left on Baudelaire's poetry by the poet's "deep experience" of the commodity do make clear the determining role played by the commodity in the emergence of any possible experience under capital. To say that Baudelaire's poetry bears the burden of docu menting the transformation of subjective experience under capital, and that it documents this transformation and transmits it to us, as our own experience, only if and insofar as it is itself a commodity, is to say that there will be no experience, no collective or cultural memory, no history under capital without the invention and inter vention of a mode of experience that can come through circulation intact. It is to say that, under modern conditions, there will be no experience ? no real, transmissible, durable experience, no Erfahrung ? that does not come to us via the market, which, we are now able to see more clearly, is not simply the telos of Baudelaire's poetry but forms part of the complex of mechanisms by which his poetry transmits history to us. Insert into Blankness It is one thing to attribute the singularity of a poet or his poet ic corpus to the blanks or gaps he puts into his poetry, as these two otherwise significantly different descriptions of Baudelaire's poetic process seem to do. But it is really quite striking to find this singu larity attributed to the poet's skillful manipulation of a certain gap or blankness in a single breath with the claim that this poetry is, at the same time, a new technology of memory, and when this blank</page><page sequence="18">114 JENNIFER A JOREK ness can be construed as something approaching meaning's nega tive image. At the very least, we may recognize that there emerges, from Benjamin's remarks about the blanks, gaps, and caesura of Baudelaire's verses, beyond a simple description of the caesura's metrical function, a deeper disjunction between memory and meaning that echoes the lapse of memory in the guise of con sciousness that was the pivot of Benjamin's shock theory. In anoth er passage from the "Motifs" essay, Benjamin describes Baude laire's poetry as an "insertion into blankness" in a way that suggests how meaning might come to insert itself, if not beyond, then pre cisely because of this lapse. Quoting Val?ry's well-known essay, Situation de Baudelaire ("Baudelaire's Situation"), Benjamin accepts Val?ry's attribution of an urgent sense of literary destiny to the poet: "How to be a great poet, but neither a Lamartine nor an Hugo nor a Musset?" But Val?ry does not actually speak of destiny; he speaks instead of Baudelaire's "raison d'?tat/' and it is this turn of phrase that sticks with Benjamin. There is, Benjamin writes, "something odd about referring to a 'reason of state' in the case of a poet. It contains some thing remarkable: the emancipation from isolated experiences [Erlebnisse], Baudelaire's poetic production is assigned a mission. Blank spaces hovered before him, and into these he inserted his poems. [Es haben ihm Leerstellen vorgeschwebt, in die er seine Gedichte eingesetzt hat]" ("M," 318).17 The description of what Baudelaire's writing gets stuck into as blank or empty space seems, at first glance, to require a slight revision of the palimpsestic mod els of history and of memory that are the special province of poet ry elsewhere in the "Motifs" essay, in which, as we have seen, the lapse in question is understood to be transmitted by the poem. Here, we see a second description of Baudelaire's poetry, which had up to now figured as a technology of memory connected with manifold displacements of the event, losses and failures of memo ry, and writing on multiple planes and in multiple psychic systems at once, in which poetry is inscribed within a still larger palimpsest. Among the possible interpretations we may rule out is that this emptiness or blank space is another name for the gap in liter</page><page sequence="19">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 115 ary history that Baudelaire supposedly fills: as if to be a great poet, but neither a Lamartine nor an Hugo, meant that Baudelaire and his corpus could be inserted in the empty space between an Hugo and a Mallarm?. We can rule out this interpretation of literary his tory as a story of great men and the anxiety of their influence because throughout virtually all of his critical and philosophical essays on literary texts Benjamin adamantly objects to this kind of linear narrative in his efforts to excavate a different kind of literary history. It is helpful to understand what is so wrong about this con ception of what, in his essay on Fuchs ("Eduard Fuchs: Collector and Historian") Benjamin calls "cultural history" if we want to grasp this final description of Baudelaire's poetry as an "insertion into blankness" and, by extension, to get the nature and texture of Benjamin's own materialist history right.18 In "Eduard Fuchs," Benjamin launches a polemic against the notion of cultural history by mobilizing a claim that was first made by Marx and Engels in The Cerman Ideology. This is the critical Marxist notion that there is no independent history of religion, no independent history of politics, and no independent history of culture, outside materialist history, which grasps all of the different human sciences as the "reflection in thought" of economic facts. Benjamin writes: There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism. No cultural histo ry has yet done justice to this fundamental state of affairs, and it can hardly hope to do so. Nevertheless, the crucial element does not lie here. If the concept of culture is problematic for histor ical materialism, it cannot conceive of the disintegration of culture into goods which become objects of posses sion for mankind. Historical materialism sees the work of the past as still incomplete. It perceives no epoch in which that work could, even in part, drop conveniently, thing-like, into mankind's lap. The concept of culture ? as the embodiment of creations considered indepen dent of the production process in which they originate,</page><page sequence="20">116 JENNIFER AJOREK or better, of a production process in which they contin ue to survive ? has a fetishistic quality. Culture appears reified. The history of culture would be nothing but the sediment formed in the consciousness of human beings by memorable events, events stirred up in the memory by no genuine experience ? that is to say, by no polit ical experience ("EF," 267-268).19 In his efforts to clear away this fetishistic concept of culture as appropriable good, Benjamin elaborates a notion of history that closely parallels the notion of experience we get in the shock the ory. History, the reader will note, is neither embodied in created works nor remembered by a consciousness. Like the experience which seems at once to produce and to give us access to it, histo ry consists of something other than what is "merely" memorable in the voluntary sense ? as if consciousness and the truth of experi ence (and in the Fuchs essay that experience is identified explicit ly as political and, therefore, collective experience) were, precise ly, at odds. The materialist historian's task, as distinguished from the cultural historian's, is thus to find, and also to keep, what is here called incompletion in the work. In order for him ? or her ? to do this, however, incompletion must be inscribed in, recorded, and ultimately vehiculated by the work in such a way that its author or producer is precisely not conscious of it. It is one thing to say that the work must convey the fact of the past's not being over. But if we take seriously Benjamin's insistence in this passage on the radical failure of human consciousness to give us access to genuine ? i.e., political ? experience, we must take this idea one step further, and conclude that the work must convey historical incompletion without meaning or wanting to. Whatever traces of genuine experience are borne by the work can not, by definition, be understood as a content: They are not the themes or meanings that an author sticks in his work, as if the work were a container or a vessel that could then transmit them to us, precisely because he is barred, in Benjamin's account, from having any consciousness of it. The truth of experience and stuff of history</page><page sequence="21">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 117 are, for Benjamin, the polar opposite of such a content. To clarify the relationship between this notion of historical truth and the special task Benjamin assigns to Baudelaire's poetry, we might cite Benjamin's preoccupation, in his understanding of the artwork, with the distinctive marks left by the artisan on its external form. In this passage from the "Motifs" essay, Benjamin's artisan is not a figure of the author, at least not in any simple sense, but rather of the storyteller, and thus stands for a certain handling of the work in the process less of its creation than of its transmis sion, although in truth Benjamin's understanding of the artwork breaks down this distinction: The replacement of the older form of narration by infor mation, and of information by sensation, reflects the increasing atrophy of experience. [T]here is a contrast between all of these forms and the story. ... A story does not aim to convey an event per se, which is the purpose of information; rather, it embeds the event in the life of the storyteller in order to pass it on as experi ence to those listening. It thus bears the trace of the sto ryteller, much the way an earthen vessel bears the trace of the potter's hand ("M," 316). Whatever is vehiculated by these traces cannot be assimilat ed to information about the event. These traces are rather a meta phor for an unconscious or other surface for psychic inscription writ large as a vessel, whose only mode of access to the truth of the event would not, however, be metaphoric but precisely m?to nymie. This is, perhaps, counterintuitive but not impossible to grasp given Benjamin's own handling, as it were, of the figure of the ves sel. For Benjamin, the vessel is a markedly textual metaphor for the story or the work: It is both the bearer of traces and an inscribed surface. And yet, given his explicit valorization of the power of the vessel (or of the story) to convey, not the event per se, but rather the traces left by those who have handled or communicated it, we may conclude that the vessel gives us access metonymically, precisely</page><page sequence="22">118 JENNIFER AJOREK nof to a meaning that it could contain and then spit back out again, but to a whole host of events and meanings that have left their mark on its external surface. Benjamin's description of Baudelaire's poetry as an insertion into blankness echoes key elements of his materialist conception of history articulated as a series of metonyms and in accordance with a logic of the Spur, or trace, and furthermore casts into relief the connections between this materalist conception of history and the shock theory. Recall, again, the bare bones of that theory: Where there is information, there can be no memory; where there is con sciousness, there can be no traces of the event. Given the funda mental incompatibility of trace and information in Benjamin's account, it makes sense to think that the "information" received about an event may take on the contours of a gap or blankness for either the individual psyche that handles it or for the poem it writes or reads. Consciousness here functions as a form of blankness for the modern subject, bearing no traces of his experience. This read ing has the merit of allowing us to line up what previously seemed like disparate forms of lapse or blankness (the lapse of modern con sciousness with regard to historical experience, the lapse of the alexandrine in the caesura, the lapses or blank spaces into which Baudelaire allegedly inserted his verse), such that this blankness can be given a more unifying and even totalizing meaning ? as if blankness could function as a moment of simple suture, marking the passage of poetry into history as well as, at the same time, the transmission of experience in poetic form. Benjamin's Cookie We should be cautious, however, if we find ourselves tempt ed to give a meaning to these blanknesses that would articulate too hastily or too seamlessly the task of Baudelaire's poetry with that of history simply by filling in the blank, or by making consciousness stand as a figure of negative knowledge, or of a lost content or mode of production of tradition ? indeed, by making any of these blanknesses stand in for a temporarily lost but ultimately recover</page><page sequence="23">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 119 able meaning. Benjamin himself gives us several reasons to be cau tious, here, one of which is the distinction between historical and pre-historical data, for which he also marks out a ritual and memo rable space in Baudelaire's poetry in the "Motifs" essay. Benjamin introduces the distinction, between historical and pre-historical data recorded in memory (and, therefore, in poetry), by way of a commentary on what is easily the most famous sonnet of the Fleurs du mal, Correspondances. This commentary doubles as a discus sion of the larger poetic doctrine of "correspondences," which has long stood at the heart of the most canonical debates in Baudelaire studies (debates about the poet's relations to nature, to the past, to symbolism, etc.). At first glance Benjamin's approach to the corre spondences seems not to distinguish itself from these other more conventional readings of Baudelaire's sonnet: for example, where it posits the correspondences as evidence of the crisis-proof experi ence successfully established and captured in an "homage to bygone times" that had escaped the poet in the guise of le temps perdu (Benjamin himself is here paying homage, explicitly, to Proust's Baudelaire interpretation) or "the outdated" ("M," 334). The sonnet Correspondances becomes evidence, in this interpretation, of the successful establishment of these nostalgic correspondences between past and present; the correspondences are or can become nostalgic precisely insofar as they are empty of historical meaning. ''Correspondances/' Benjamin writes, "are the data of recollection ? not historical data, but data of prehistory. What makes festive days great and significant is the encounter with an earlier life. Baudelaire [also] recorded this in a sonnet entitled La Vie ant?rieure. The images of caves and vegetation, of clouds and waves which are evoked at the beinning of this second sonnet rise from the warm vapor of tears ? tears of homesickness. . . . What is past murmurs in the correspondences, and the canonical experience of them has its place in a previous life" ("M," 334, emphasis mine). The very possibility that there could exist such a distinction, between a poetic transmission of prehistorical versus historical data, is shocking to the reader of the "Motifs," for this distinction suggests an alternative model of poetry and of poetic composition,</page><page sequence="24">120 JENNIFER BAJOREK in which the past would be recorded but not transmitted histori cally. If we take this distinction seriously, we must conclude that at least some of Baudelaire's poetry is not a technology of memory but only of loss. The lapse of memory represented by the success ful recollection of prehistorical data is not a model of poetry to which history could ever attach itself ? and yet it is also, if we fol low Benjamin here, a model of Baudelaire's poetry. There emerges, in light of this second model of poetry and this second technology of loss, the recognition of a poetic lapse that is utterly devoid of meaning, not in the sense that it is empty of content (or even of semantic content, as was the case in the pas sage about the caesura), but in the sense that its meaning has not become historical. Benjamin does not say explicitly here that these prehistorical data recollected in the correspondences will never become historical, but certainly the prospect threatens, and, in any case, we know that the essential possibility of this distinction, between data that are historical but have not yet been recognized as such and those that are not (and that have even been falsely judged historical), is the most basic condition of the emergence of a rigorously materalist conception of history for Benjamin. Given the critic's own thematization of this distinction as one that could itself belong to or be transmitted by Baudelaire's poetry, we, as readers, must confront the possibility that we ourselves do not know how to read, or that we will not be able to recognize as historical, the blanknesses that crop up in Benjamin's own inter pretation and handling of Baudelaire's poetry. For there is a kind of central silence running through those passages of the "Motifs" that deal, appropriately enough, with inclusions that manifest them selves as exclusions and things that become legible only in their absence ? things that Benjamin himself finds "in" Baudelaire's poems without telling or showing us exactly how, or where, to read them. For example, we may hear this silence in the critical lines about the figure of the masses: "The masses had become so much a part of Baudelaire that it is rare to find a description of them in his works. His most important subjects are hardly ever encountered in descriptive form. As Desjardins so aptly put it, [Baudelaire] was</page><page sequence="25">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 121 'more concerned with implanting the image in the memory than with adorning and elaborating it'" ("M," 322). Or again: "Baude laire describes neither the Parisians nor their city. Avoiding such descriptions enables him to invoke the former in the figure of the latter" ("M," 322); "The crowd, whose existence Baudelaire is always aware of, does not serve as a model for any of his works; but it is imprinted on his creativity as a hidden figure" ("M," 321); or finally: "In Tableaux parisiens, the secret presence of the crowd is demonstrable everywhere" ("M," 323). Even as we are told that Baudelaire placed "the shock experience [Chockerfahrung] at the center of his art," and even as we are told that the masses are, for the poet, a decisive factor in shock's production, Benjamin keeps silent about how the poetry records the shock it must both experi ence and transmit. How does the poetry implant the image in memory ? presumably in our memory, in the recesses of our great big involuntary cultural memory ? without actually including it? How does the poetry, omitting the description of two things (Paris and Parisians), end up invoking both? Benjamin's silence, as to how the events undergone by the psyche actually get inserted in the poetry, calls to mind one last passage from an earlier fragment: one of the critic's first known texts on Baudelaire, written in 1921 and titled, simply, "Baude laire." In this remarkable little text, he writes: Let us compare time to a photographer ? earthly time to a photographer who photographs the essence of things. But because of the nature of earthly time and its apparatus, the photographer manages only to register the negative of that essence on his photographic plates. No one can read these plates; no one can deduce from the negative, on which time records the objects, the true essence of things as they really are. Moreover, the elixir that might act as the developing agent is unknown. And there is Baudelaire: he doesn't possess the vital fluid either. . . . But he, and he alone, is able to read the plates, thanks to infinite mental efforts.20</page><page sequence="26">122 JENNIFER A JOREK What I find compelling about this early photographic theory of his tory, although it is in many respects cruder than the similar theories we find in later texts (including "On the Concept of History") is that it so deliberately and explicitly omits a single vital element: the developer. This omission or exclusion ? it is not an oversight but rather calculated and deliberate and the whole point of the passage ? calls to our attention what can seem at times strangely displaced or forced underground in the interpretation of Baudelaire's poetry that Benjamin gives us in the shock theory. This is any adequate treatment of the material interface between psyches. There is no storyteller, no artisan, like the one we saw depicted in the "Motifs" essay, who would bring the figure of the vessel along with him, no information and, even more to the point, no narration represented here: Baudelaire is not a storyteller; he is a poet. And perhaps even more than the material interface between psyches (or between psy che and text), Benjamin's shock theory needs a thesis about the material interface between consciousness and memory: whether we conceive of both of these as somehow internal to a given psy che or text, or whether we conceive of a psyche/text as some kind of switching mechanism between two otherwise radically disjoint ed circuits traced by the data of experience. The shock theory needs a theory of language or, at the very least, of reading, a ques tion on which "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" can seem strange ly silent, especially in comparison with Benjamin's other writings. You will recall that, in the shock theory, poetry is the privi leged mechanism whereby experience comes to be recorded and even becomes, in Benjamin's account, the condition of possibility of experience's recording and transmission under capital. The task, at least, assigned to Baudelaire's poetry is clear. But Benjamin repeatedly ends up eliding any coherent thesis about the material interface through which Baudelaire's poetry would actually trans mit the shock experience to us, whether in the mode of a conscious parrying or in some other mode. Benjamin also writes: One won ders how lyric poetry can be grounded in an experience for which exposure to shock has become the norm. One would expect such poetry to have a large measure of consciousness. . . . This is</page><page sequence="27">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 123 indeed true of Baudelaire's poetry" ("M," 318). Benjamin explicitly attributes "a large measure of consciousness" to Baudelaire's poet ry, and yet he never actually tells us whether it is because of, or despite, this "large measure" of consciousness that this poetry suc ceeds in transmitting the truth of historical experience to us. We know that there are poems, such as Correspondances, that succeed in establishing a crisis-proof experience, but these are not the poems, in Benjamin's account, of truly historical interest. Poetry may be a psyche, but it cannot only be a psyche. Or rather, if it is to be thought within the sphere of psychic life, then something must be introduced into the psyche allowing it to move, in oblique relation to consciousness, in and out of history. Only language has the materiality necessary to mediate this movement in and out of the sphere of collective experience and the proper measure of opacity necessary to "carry," as it were, metonymically the memory traces that form the unconscious inscription of history. And it is only of language that Baudelaire's poetry consists ? unless, that is, we count, in oblique relation to language, the myr iad and disparate forms of blankness theorized by Benjamin. The closest we come in Benjamin's essay to a figure of language that could sustain this dual demand ? to perform but also effectively to block mediation ? is a material object that is already familiar to us from Benjamin's analysis of Proust in the "Motifs" essay. This is the cookie, which has the power to perform mediation only by block ing it and to do so metonymically. Proust's cookie ? the madeleine ? is, in Benjamin's inter pretation and like the earthen vessel, a m?tonymie figure allowing for the distinction between information, on the one hand, and access afforded to the truth of the event by involuntary memory, on the other. "One afternoon," explains Benjamin, "the taste of a kind of pastry called a madeleine, to which he later repeatedly returns, transported him [Proust/Marcel] back to the past, whereas before then he had been limited to the promptings of a memory which obeyed the call of conscious attention. This he calls m?moire volon taire. Its signal characteristic is that the information it gives about the past retains nothing of that past" ("M," 315). Benjamin goes on</page><page sequence="28">124 JENNIFER A JOREK to emphasize the accidental nature of our encounter, as moderns, with the truth of our experience: "Proust says, [this is Benjamin quoting Proust] 'that the past is situated 'somewhere beyond the reach of the intellect and its field of operations, in some real object, though we have no idea which one it /s"'("M," 315, emphasis mine). The past is situated somewhere beyond the reach of intellect ? that is, Benjamin says, echoing Proust, in a cookie. Of course, the past is not actually in the cookie and is rather metonymically linked to it: like the traces of experience inscribed on the vessel's exterior surface. The trick is thus to find the right cookie at the right time. For what the cookie actually "records" and carries as its meaning is not something inside it but rather the traces of all the other things that were going on at that time in Marcel's life, when he also happened to have had the experience of eating the tisane dunked madeleines. Under modern conditions, the individual runs the risk of living his whole life without stumbling upon the right trig ger of involuntary memory and thus without ever gaining access to the truth of his experience, as Benjamin takes care to emphasize. Baudelaire's poetry is, for us, a psyche, and ours to share col lectively. But, as a psyche ? and this is Benjamin's lesson ? it can become an experiential and historical transmitter only by becom ing a cookie at the same time. If we follow Benjamin's interpreta tion out to the letter, this poetry must become the linguistic equiv alent of Marcel's madeleine for us, if, that is, it is to come down through history, to us. We should feel very lucky that Benjamin has found our cookie for us: in Baudelaire's poetry. For without this material interface, there is no hope of any passage or transmission, not just from memory to historical consciousness, but from one tex tual inscription or recording of experience to another. The uncon scious may be structured like a language, but language, or at least in Benjamin's account, Baudelaire's language, must be structured like a cookie. If Benjamin's theory of poetry is also going to be a theory of history or of cultural memory, then poetry must also be, for this theory, a madeleine, and it must become the linguistic equivalent of a madeleine for future generations. If we take seri ously Benjamin's understanding of poetry as a technology of col</page><page sequence="29">INSERT INTO BLANK?ESS 125 lective or cultural memory, there could be no transmission of expe rience without a language approximating this cookie. This explains the strange yet unmistakable emphasis on opac ity, stumbling, and the alternating lapse and involuntary jogging of memory in those passages in "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" where we see Benjamin discuss Baudelaire's poetic process. As we saw in his treatment of Le Soleil, Benjamin lingers on the poem's description of its own poetic method, in which he is seen to go traipsing, or quite literally, tripping through the streets of Paris, stumbling over words, and not just over words, but over fragments of words, over lines and rhymes, just as the solitary walker stum bles over paving stones in the glare of the afternoon sun. You will recall that Benjamin was quick to connect this stumbling, bum bling poet figure with the shock experience and, therefore, with the subject of capital. He also speaks, towards the close of this same passage, of the "subterranean shocks" by which Baudelaire's poet ry is shaken. It is as if, Benjamin says, this poetry were rocked by subterranean shocks that caused its words to collapse. In closing, it seems worth nothing that, on the basis of this thesis, about the instability or uncertainty, not simply of the poet's footing with regard to his readers or to his material, but of the struc tures undergirding and governing the relations among his words, we may understand Benjamin's silence about the crowd somewhat differently. As he explains, toward the close of his reading of Le Soleil, that the real location of the crowd in Baudelaire's poetry ? the crowd, you will recall, that is supposed to be there without actually being there, and whose secret presence is thus demon strable everywhere ? is not in some synesthetic echoing roar in the street (as both de Man and Jameson seem to suggest in their Baudelaire interpretations), nor even in the fetishization of a pass ing woman's leg, but in the "words, fragments, and beginnings of lines" from which, the poet, "in the deserted streets, wrests his poetic booty."21 These fragments of words, collapsed in on them selves, Benjamin explains, form the true "phantom crowd" of Baudelaire's poetry. It is the secret presence of these fragments that allows Baudelaire's poetry to give us, on Benjamin's reading, an</page><page sequence="30">126 JENNIFER BAJOREK account of capital as well as an account of our own destiny, as readers, alongside these others. We ourselves are the crowd and its most radical point of entry into Baudelaire's poetry. More so than the more familiar passages about tradition as the basis of historical transmission, and more so even than the well-known theory of the shock experience, it is, I think, this kind of passage about the material opacities of Baudelaire's language that is able to make explicit the singular challenge of Benjamin's Baudelaire interpretation: that it has us looking for experience and for history, and specifically for our shared history under capital, not in words and their meanings, nor in anything else that could be transmitted by any work of art or of poetry in the mode of a con tent, but in the cracks and fissures where all that is other than meaning takes hold. Forget the cookie, we now see that a rock would be enough to hold this interpretation together: All that is needed is some material opacity stumbled upon in the course of reading, and a sufficiently m?tonymie instance of language and conception of memory to allow this opacity to serve as a transmit ter, rather than as an absorber, of shock. Returning one last time to the Fuchs essay, we will recall that the materialist historian's task was not just to find, but to keep, incompletion in the work. We may now phrase this problem a lit tle differently, emphasizing perhaps more starkly the role of histo ry in the production and transmission of the work (rather than the role of the work in the production and transmission of history), and specify that the history that transmits a text to us must come down to us as incomplete. This is if and insofar it is going to be our his tory, and quite apart from whether we disavow or recognize it as such. The work of art or of poetry is not somehow incidental to his tory, nor does it pass through history unscathed, as its simple medi um of transmission, or in such a way that "historical continuity" can be preserved. Rather it shatters (as other texts make more explicit) the unity of every historical moment. This it can do only by adding us, another thumbprint, to its meaning or, more appro priately, its memory.</page><page sequence="31">INSERT INTO BLANKNESS 127 1 Walter Benjamin, "Central Park" in Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, Volume 4: 1938-1940, ed. Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2003), 176. "Central Park" here after cited as "CP." Selected Writings, Volume 4 hereafter cited as SW4. 2 Hanssen writes eloquently of Benjamin's "other history" in her book by that title. See Beatrice Hanssen, Walter Benjamin's Other History: Of Stones, Animals, Human Beings, and Angels (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1998). In borrowing, but also pluralizing, her term for Benjamin's intervention in theoreti cal discourse about history, my intention is to emphasize that Benjamin's theory of history can neither call itself "new" nor be unified as one (a single theory of a sin gle history), for reasons of the commodity's transformation of temporal experience and for reasons of this break, for which Benjamin's theory of history calls, with his toricist (and ultimately narrative) models (Hanssen, passim). 3 To name only one recent translation of Benjamin's theory of history onto other ter rain, see Michael Taussig, Walter Benjamin's Grave (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006). 4 I refer both to the fact that Benjamin's projected book on Baudelaire was never fin ished as a book and to the complexity of the relationship of his texts on Baudelaire to those on other themes and topics, which were (with the possible exception of the Trauerspiel book) also unfinished. At the very least, the reader should keep in mind that the book known to us as Charles Baudelaire: Ein Lyriker im Zeitalter des Hochkapitalismus {Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism) is not a coherent manuscript and rather presents fragments of different drafts of what may or may not have been a single project. In the generally accredited account (reconstructed from Benjamin's description of the project to his friends and editors, including Adorno, in the correspondence), the 1938 essay known to us as "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire" was to be the middle of three sections, with the other two sections, "Baudelaire as Allegorist" and "The Commodity as the Subject of Poetry," either unfinished or, depending on whose account one reads, not yet written. (On the complex relationship of the text published as "Central fork" to the projected first section of the book ("Baudelaire as Allegorist"), see Lloyd Spencer, "Introduction to Central Park," New German Critique 34 (Winter 1985): 28-31.) Benjamin then scratched this version ? in response, it is generally thought, to Adorno's criticisms ? and produced "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" in its place. See Walter Benjamin, On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" in SW4, 313-55, hereafter cited as "M." The debates about the relationship of Benjamin's texts on Baudelaire to other projected books and texts from the same period, including, of course, the monumental project on the Paris arcades, are manifold and too complex to explore here in depth. It may at the very least be noted that the popular perception of the Baudelaire book as a freestanding work distinct from the work on the arcades can be attributed in large part to Rolf Tiedemann's editorial decisions in the Suhrkamp Gesammelte Schriften, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1974 1989). To give only one example illustrating the stakes and complexity of such deci sions, we may note that one editor has claimed the 1935 essay on "Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century" as an early draft of the Baudelaire project whereas another editor has claimed the same text as an early "expos?" of the arcades pro</page><page sequence="32">128 JENNIFER AJOREK ject, with Benjamin's own comments in the correspondence authorizing both deci sions.

Jennings, "On the Banks of a New Lethe: Commodification and Experience in Benjamin's Baudelaire Book," Boundary 2 (Spring 2003): 89-104. 5 The reader will recall the simple historical rationale for a comparative reading of Baudelaire's poetry and Marx's critique of capital: Marx was born in 1818, in Trier; Baudelaire, in 1821, in Paris. In 1844, Marx met, and began his lifelong collabora tion with, Engels in Paris ? the same year in which Baudelaire is thought to have composed the first of the poems of Les Fleurs du mal. Both participated actively in the 1848 revolutions in Europe. Marx started work on the Grundrisse in 1857, with Baudelaire publishing the first of the Fleurs in that same year. Baudelaire died, pre maturely, of syphilis, in 1867 ? the year of the long-delayed publication of the first volume of Capital. It is precisely this kind of data, which for nearly a century formed the basis of (vulgar) Marxist studies of literature, that Benjamin's Baudelaire inter pretation is designed to contest. 6 Benjamin uses the phrase, "the crisis of lyric poetry," with reference to Baudelaire's friend, Pierre Dupont, in "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire" in SW4. He later writes, in "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire," that some of Baudelaire's motifs "render the possibility of lyrit poetry problematic" ("M," 341). 7 Considerable attention has been devoted to Benjamin's correspondence with Adorno and to this exchange in particular, although, to my knowledge, none of the critical literature has interpreted the stakes of Adorno's comments on "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire" with direct reference to Baudelaire or indeed to Benjamin's interpretation of his texts, choosing instead to mobilize the debate towards a rereading of Marx (Agamben, "The Prince and the Frog"), of Derrida on Marx (Rapaport), or of Adorno's own project (Kaufman).

What is more, they were even connected to differ ent subjects. The subject of experience was common sense, something existing in every individual. . . , while the subject of science is the nous or the active intel lect, which is separate from experience, 'impassive' and 'divine' (though, to be pre cise, knowledge did not even have a subject in the modern sense of an ego, but rather the single individual was the sub-jectum in which the active, unique and sep arate intellect actuated knowledge" (18).

To cite only one example of Adorno's own "materialist enumeration," he claims that, through the work (or play) of certain syntactical "cuts" or caesurae in H?lderlin's late poetry, the "mediation [of judgment] is eliminated" and we are granted "consciousness of the non-identical object" (Theodor W.

It is worth noting that, in one of Benjamin's earliest known fragments on Baudelaire, written in 1921, he likens the historical nature and texture of Baudelaire's poetry to those of photography. I discuss this text briefly toward the close of this essay. 17 See also Walter Benjamin, Gesammelte Schriften Volume 1, Part 2, ed.
