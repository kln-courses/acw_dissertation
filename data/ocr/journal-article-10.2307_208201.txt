<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAPAN * By CARL WHITING BISHOP Smithsonian Institution It is matter for congratulation, in view of the steadily growing interest in the question, that the accumulation of evidence from various sources. begins at length to throw some definite light on the origin of the. Japanese people. Much confusion has existed on this subject hitherto, owing mainly to the fact that the work of investigators along different, lines had been, insufficiently collated and correlated, while at the same time the methods of interpretation were not altogether free from fault. A solution of the problem is not to be attained by a study of conditions and events in' the Japanese islands alone. The same causes which have brought about the various contacts, friendly or hostile, between Japan on the one hand and: eastern Siberia, Korea, Shantung, and the southeastern Chinese littoral on the other, during the past three decades, have been at work without inter- mission ever since the first settlement of man-in this portion of the globe. The developments, political, social, economic, whose course we have followed with such close attention during the past few years are but the latest phase of a process whose beginnings are lost in the darkness of pre- historic time. It is thither that we must trace them if we would arrive at anything like a right comprehension of the foundation upon which rests the national life of Japan. FIRST CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTS OF THE JAPANESE PEOPLE Derived without exception from Chinese sources' are our first contem- porary accounts of the Japanese people, two thousand years ago. The region at that time occupied by their various tribes embraced not what we think of as the Japanese islands, but only their westernmost portions, together apparently with the southern end of the Korean peninsula and the large island known to us as Quelpart, lying out in the Yellow Sea. As will be seen, it was not until the seventh century of our era that the Japa- nese became in reality wholly an island people. Hence insularity was far from being the geographical factor of most weight in their early development. Of vastly greater significance was the fact that during their formative period they were in such close touch with the various civilized communities of the continent. * Read at the Joint Meeting of the Association of American Geographers and the American Geographical .Society, April, 1922. 1 See for an account of these, James Murdoch: A History of Japan, Yokohama, I90o, Vol. i, pp. 3I et seq.

The line D-D was reached by the Japanese about the beginning of the eighth century, and the occupation of the main island may be regarded as completed, in its broad outlines, by the close of the tenth century.

The sail was still quite unknown in Far Eastern waters in those prehistoric ages when the peopling of the Japanese islands was going on, so that there was no way in which the monsoons could exert any particular influence upon the course of migration.2 And the southern element, so clearly apparent in both the people and their culture, came not from those equatorial regions whence flows the Japan Current but from a direction at right angles to it, the seaboard of China, in days before Chinese civiliza- tion had yet reached the coast. Those who speak of a Polynesian or a Malayan strain in the Japanese ignore entirely the historical aspect of the problem; the great Polynesian diffusion did not take place until long after the emergence of the Japanese people, while the Malays do not appear on the scene until later still. The real effect of the southwest monsoon and the warm tropical current has been a climatic one. To them it has been due that the type of culture developed during prehistoric times in the south- eastern coast lands of the continent could find in the southern and western portions of the Japanese archipelago those conditions of warmth and humidity requisite to its survival and further development. Of Paleolithic man in Japan there has so far appeared absolutely no trace, and it is altogether likely that the islands, together with the east of Asia generally, remained unpeopled until geologically very recent times. The earliest inhabitants of Japan of whom we have any knowledge were the ancestors of the existing Ainu of Yezo (Hokkaido), who at one time occupied the entire archipelago, remaining in undisturbed possession during a period which may well have extended over several thousand years. At length, probably far back in the first millennium before Christ, if not indeed earlier still, there began a fresh invasion of the Japanese islands, this time by peoples belonging to various branches of the great Mongoloid stock, from eastern Siberia to the south Chinese littoral, with probably in the latter case a slight Negrito admixture. The result of the minglings in varying proportions between these newcomers and their predecessors forms to this day the great bulk of the Japanese population.3 Finally, commencing not long before our era and recurring at intervals for several centuries, there was a series of immigrations of northern Mon- 2 On the late introduction of the sail in Japanese waters, see B.

THE ANCESTRAL AINU The first of these races, that of the ancestral Ainu, seems to have reached the Japanese islands in at least three successive waves, perhaps separated by long intervals of time.4 Recent studies have shown that it was divided into several subtypes, at least two of which appear to sur- vive in the existing Ainu. That the language of this ancient race was essentially that still spoken by its surviving representatives in the island of Yezo is indicated by the fact that place names occur all over the Japanese islands, from end to end, and possibly even in the Loochoo group, which can only be explained in terms of Ainu speech.5 Regarding the origin of this prim- FIG. 2-Ainu man and women at Piratori, itive people we are still wholly in the island of Yezo; the man has ceremonial headdress and moustache lifter.

Language tells us nothing; for, aside from loan words from neighboring tongues, the Ainu speech stands entirely isolated.6 Physically there is no evidence of connection with the Mongoloid family, save for such interminglings as have taken place in relatively recent times. Many investigators have regarded the Amur region of Siberia as that from which this ancient race entered Japan. The fact should not be overlooked, however, that individuals of Ainu type are by no means un- known in Korea, while a possible relationship has also been suggested between the Ainu and the Pre-Dravidian tribes of India, or even with the natives of Australia. Perhaps we may say, in the light of all the available evidence, that the few thousand Ainu still remaining, as well as the related stocks inhabiting Japan in days prior to the advent of Mongoloid man, represent an extremely 4See regarding these ancestral Ainu, in addition to the papers by Hasebe and Matsumoto, already cited, N.

They were already in the Neolithic stage as far back as they have been traced. They manufactured polished stone implements and a highly interesting and very ornate type of pottery, made, of course, with- out the aid of the potter's wheel. They seem to have derived part of their FIG. 3-Old Ainu man operating canoe ferry in interior of island of Yezo.

Of do- mestic animals, with the exception of the dog, they were entirely ignorant. In summer they lived in rough huts and in winter in earth-covered lodges constructed either partly or wholly underground. Dwelling mainly on the coast and knowing how to make large dugout canoes, they were fearless sea- farers, hunting the whale as well as smaller marine animals and, in later times, meeting the fleets of war boats of the invading Japanese in fiercely contested naval combats from which the newcomers by no means always emerged victorious. Of their social, political, and military organization we can infer but little. It seems clear, however, that in these respects they were scarcely if at all behind the earlier comers of Mongolian extraction who settled among them; for they were able to keep the latter pretty closely confined to the extreme western portions of the Japanese archipelago for many centuries. It was simply and solely the stubborn geographical fact that the Mongoloids always had free access to the civilizing influences emanating from the continent, 7 On the classification of the Ainu, see George Montandon: Notice preliminaire sur les Ainou, Archives Suisses d'Anthropologie Generale, Vol. 4, No. 3, I92I, pp. 233-246; reference on p. 242; also, A.

EARLY MONGOLOID INVASIONS We know from various sources that southeastern Asia prior to the rise of the Chinese civilization was occupied by a race of Mongoloid stock, akin to the existing peoples of Indo-China and Indonesia, whose original culture, of a generalized Neolithic type, had taken on a distinctly southern and mari- time aspect. That it was in contact, however, with more northern regions is FIG. 4-Type of Japanese fishing with aid of large dip net, introduced from southern or central China. shown by the occurrence both in Shantung and in Japan of the grooved stone ax, a type of implement found likewise in the North Pacific area.8 The discovery again both in China and in Japan of the peculiarly shaped ob- jects known in the latter country as seki-bo, or "stone clubs," also indicates a former widespread community of culture, extending in this instance even to the Ainu. Socially, this southeastern Asiatic culture seems to have been character- ized by descent in the female line, by seasonal mating festivals, and, at least in the ruling families, by brother-and-sister marriage.9 The economic life., based primarily upon fishing, with doubtless some hunting, had been en- riched before the close of the Neolithic period by the acquisition of various food plants, cultivated with the aid of the hoe alone. Among methods of bodily ornamentation were blackening of the teeth and tattooing. But little clothing was worn, save in cold weather; and the habit of promiscuous bathing, with a total indifference to bodily exposure, was general. No domestic animals other than the dog and the fowl appear to have been 8 On this question of the grooved ax, see Berthold Laufer: Jade: A Study in Chinese Archaeology and Re- ligion, Field Museum of Nat.

In the absence of metals, great use was made of bamboo, although stone and bone were also utilized in various ways. There is some reason to believe that the spear rather than the bow was the weapon most commonly in use. As befitted a culture essentially amphibious in type, large canoes were made, each usually ornamented at the bow with the carved head of a crocodile or an alligator.10 The religion was one of nature worship, with a strongly anthropomorphic trend and a highly interesting body of folklore. Possibly as a result of the matrilineal organization of society, the principle of reproduction and growth received special veneration, and goddesses were particularly in evidence. Ancestor worship, where found at all in this area, appears only late and then as a consequence of the introduction, among the higher classes, of a patriarchal type of family in imitation of the Chinese. Practically all these culture elements are traceable in Japan, some of them surviving to this day, while others have disappeared only in comparatively recent times. From the end of the promontory of Shantung to the corresponding pro- jection on the opposite coast of Korea it is only a trifle over a hundred miles -a stretch of sea easily negotiable by such inveterate sea rovers as were the Neolithic coast peoples of eastern and southeastern Asia. The strait between Korea and Japan is almost exactly the same distance across; and here there are islands where early voyagers could conveniently break their journey. It seems likely for a number of reasons that the colonization of Japan by the Mongoloid peoples of the neighboring continent took place largely by way of Korea. Probably, however, even within the Neolithic period a good deal of migration went on also directly across the Yellow Sea. The distance here is something under five hundred miles, with the lofty island peak of Quelpart, already mentioned, forming a natural stepping-stone. This migration of peoples into Japan, to be properly understood, must be viewed as a phase of that great ethnic movement which brought about the colonization by the so-called yellow-brown races of so much of the enormous area extending from Japan on the east to Madagascar on the west. When this process began, we are as yet unable to say; but it seems not unlikely that one of the contributing factors was the pressure generated by the slow ex- pansion coastward of the Chinese in the second and first milleniums before Christ. The disturbances set up, for'example, by the Chou conquest of the Yellow River basin, about the eleventh century before our era, were felt far and wide and must have led to much shifting of peoples both by land and by sea."

C., the ruling class of the latter are said to have made their escape to certain islands to the eastward, which can hardly have been other than the western portion of the Japanese group.'2 The earliest distinct reference to Japan in the Chinese writings, however, is one in the work known as the Shan Hai Ching, to the effect that the north- ern and southern Wo are tributary to Yen, a Chinese feudal kingdom at the head of the Gulf of Chihli.13 Inasmuch as Yen ceased to exist as an inde- pendent state in the year 226 B. C., this notice carries us back at least as far as the middle of the third century before our era, and possibly even farther still, since we know that Yen had been sending out exploring expeditions by sea as early as the reign of King Wei (378-343 B. C.).14 We need not infer, however, that an actual conquest by Yen of any part of the Japanese islands ever took place. As is well known, it was long an official convention in China that all outsiders resorting to her for purposes of trade came to her as "tribute bearers." It may therefore be fairly concluded from the passage in the Shan Hai Ching that the two Wo peoples were in the habit of sending trading parties to Yen which had the cognizance of its government in days when foreign commerce was kept as far as possible a close state monopoly. Precisely where the two Wo are to be sought, it is impossible to say. Perhaps the northern branch inhabited the lower extremity of the Korean peninsula;'5 or, on the other hand, they may both have dwelt in western Japan. That the southern, or "Great," Wo were located in Kyushu seems quite clear. For another name applied to their country by Chinese writers is that of Ye-ma-t'ai. This region, we are told, lay to the south of Korea- somewhere, that is to say, in the island of Kyushu-and contained a hun- dred petty kingdoms, all subject to the Ta Wo Wang, or great king of the Wo. It is further described as a maritime region with a late Stone Age cul- ture, lying nearly due east of what is now the Chinese province of Che- kiang and enjoying so mild a climate that vegetables were grown both win- ter and summer.16 12 Albert Tschepe: Histoire du royaume de Ou (II22-473 av.

While the date of composition of the Shan Hai Ching has not yet been settled beyond dispute, the weight of evidence points toward the third or second century before Christ, although it undoubtedly contains much earlier elements. 1 For the maritime explorations of Yen, see Edouard Chavannes, Memoires Historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien (5 vols., Paris, I895-I905), Vol. 3, pp. 436 et seq.; on the conquest of Yen by Ch'in Shih Hwang-ti in B.

Inasmuch as the state archives of Yen, like those of practically all the rest of the ancient Chinese feudal states, have been lost, we know nothing regarding the details of her maritime explorations. 16 Cf.

S</page><page sequence="10">HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAPAN Now the winters of the Japanese Pacific seaboard are mild, it is true, thanks to the Japan Current. But nowhere are they mild enough to admit of the winter ripening of crops, save in certain favored localities of Shikoku and Kyushu; and of Shikoku in this connection there is no question. Yet several modern writers, influenced by the similarity in sound, have insisted upon identifying Ye-ma-t'ai with the Japanese province of Yamato, far away to the eastward, in the heart of the mountainous peninsula forming the boundary of the Inland Sea in that direction. It is hard to believe, however, that when the careful and evidently well informed Chinese his- torians speak of a maritime region with an extremely mild winter climate, lying far to the south, they really mean an inland province with a decidedly cold winter, situated in the distant east. Nevertheless there may exist a connection between Ye-ma-t'ai and Ya- mato after all. Both the Chinese historians and their own legends represent the primitive Japanese as located first of all in Kyushu, where in fact the word "Yamato" does actually occur, as a place name. in both Higo and Chikugo provinces.'7 We know further that this name has been applied by the Japanese people to themselves in a very definite way; Yamato damnashii, for example, means the spirit of the Japanese people, not that of the province of Yamato. Hence it seems possible at least that "Yamato" was the name applied to themselves, while still in Kyushu, by the people whom the Chinese usually referred to as the Wo and that when, as we shall see, they transferred their seat of government to central Japan they carried their name with them. CULTURE AREAS IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA The Korean peninsula during these times, just prior to and about the beginning of the Christian era, was divided into two quite distinct culture areas. In the north and extending over into what is now southern Manchu- ria were various tribes with cultures basically akin to those of eastern Siberia generally, though beginning to be modified by influences both from the neighboring Chinese states and from Central Asia.18 Farther to the south the peninsula was the home of the peoples called by the early Chinese writers the "Three Han." While the precise boundaries of these are unknown, gen- erally speaking the Ma-Han occupied the west and southwest of the pen- insula, with the ShAn-Han to the east of them, on the Sea of Japan, and the Pien-Han in the extreme south. These three Han peoples were clearly recognized by their Chinese contemporaries as quite distinct from their northern neighbors, while on the other hand there evidently existed between them and the primitive Japanese an extremely close kinship if not indeed an 17 Frank Brinkley and Baron Kikuchi: A History of the Japanese People from the Earliest Times to the End of the Meiji Era, New York and London, 1912, p. 84; W.

The same was also true, apparently, of the people of Quel- part Island, where traces of southern contacts are unmistakable to this day.19 This entire region, in fact, formed in prehistoric times a distinct cul- ture area whose closest connections are to be sought in the Chinese coast lands as they were before they came under the influence of Chinese civiliza- tion. It was only shortly before the beginning of the Christian era that bands of refugees, fleeing from the wars then devastating China, founded various states in southern Korea in which they introduced that Late Bronze Age culture which then characterized their own country. Sh6n-Han-later the kingdom of Hsin-lo, or Silla-in spite of its comparative isolation with regard to China, maintained especially close relations with that country, and the consequent superiority in culture which it enjoyed as compared with its immediate neighbors is evident throughout its history. INTRODUCTION OF BRONZE AND IRON INTO JAPAN There can be little doubt that it was from these newly founded states of southern Korea that metal was first introduced into Japan. The history of bronze in that country is peculiar. It cannot, in fact, be said that a true Bronze Age ever existed there at all.20 The records of the Later Han Dynasty describe the people of Wo, early in the Christian era, as still in the Neolithic stage of culture. This statement regarding their ignorance of metal at that time is strikingly confirmed by the discovery in various parts of western Japan, in association with stone implements, of Chinese coins of the first century of our era.21 The histories of the Wei and Chin dynasties, on the other hand, referring to the third and fourth centuries, mention iron as known to the Wo. It would appear, therefore, that the very brief and wholly exotic bronze culture which archeological research has disclosed to us in Japan must have fallen somewhere about the second century or so of our era. Bronze remains in Japan are few and far between, and such as there are occur only in the western portion of the country. They are quite un- known anywhere to the east of the Lake Biwa area, that isthmian region of central Japan where the Ainu held back their Mongoloid foes through so many centuries. Aside from ceremonial objects, the known remains consist mainly of swords, daggers, and arrowheads-all closely resembling well known Chinese Bronze Age types. The discovery of molds indicates that some casting was done in Japan; but the raw material and a great proportion of the finished articles seem to have been imported, either from Korea or even direct from China, as is also suggested by the name, Karakane, which 19 H.

A seventh-century king of T'am-na, as the island was then called, bore a name, Yuritoro, which has a de- cidedly Japanese sound. 20 The British Museum's "Guide to the Antiquities of the Bronze Age," I904, is hardly exact in stating that the Japanese were already in the late Bronze Age when they entered the islands; they had long been in Japan when the knowledge of bronze was brought to them. It was a case of a cultural, not a racial, migration. 21 Dr. K. Hamada, of the Kyoto Imperial University, in personal letters of July I0, 1917, and Dec. 20, I920. 50</page><page sequence="12">HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAPAN may mean either Korean or Chinese metal. Introduced only after its use in China had already been largely superseded by that of iron, it was but a short time before bronze was overtaken and displaced by the later metal in Japan also. And so effectively was it eclipsed, save of course for ornamental and ritual objects, that neither the Kojiki nor the Nihongi,22 the two earliest Japanese historical works that have come down to us, betray the slightest recollection of a former Bronze Age; the use of copper arrowheads upon one occasion being mentioned solely as something unusual. But, if the influence of bronze upon the cultural development of Japan was thus slight, with iron the case was far otherwise. Historical notices are wanting; but good grounds exist for thinking that iron reached Japan merely as one element of an entirely different material culture complex, partly Chinese and partly Central Asiatic in origin,23 which had taken form somewhere in Korea and which was far higher than anything that the Jap- anese islands had yet known. That this cultural invasion was the result of actual conquest of any part of the country in a military sense cannot be cate- gorically stated; but the presumption seems on the whole in favor of some- thing of the kind. OTHER EVIDENCES OF INVASION FROM KOREA The evidence of language, for one thing, appears to point in this direction. Japanese belongs to an independent family, whose only other members are Korean and Loochooan, and such indications as there are point to central rather than to southern Asia as the region of its origin.24 The most plausible conjecture-in the present state of our knowledge it can be nothing more- would seem to be that it reached Japan as the tongue of a relatively highly civilized body of invaders, not necessarily large, penetrating southward from the Korean peninsula and imposing their authority and their language upon the less civilized tribes, presumably of mixed Ainu and southern Mongoloid origin, whom they found in possession of the western portion of the islands. That such movements were constantly recurring within Korea itself, we know from the Chinese records. About 200 B. C., for example, when refugees from China conquered the state of Chao-hsien, in southern Manchuria, the king of the latter country escaped southward by sea with several thousand of his followers and secured a footing for a season in Ma- 22 The Kojiki dates from 712 A. D., the Nihongi from 720. Chamberlain's translation of the former and that of the latter by Aston have already been cited. There is also another of the later work, by Dr. Karl Florenz: Nihongi, "Zeitalter der Gotter," Tokyo, 9goI. 23 Among the traces of Central Asiatic influence upon the Early Iron Age civilization of Japan are the reliance upon horse archers as the principal fighting arm; the use of the nari-kabura or "sounding arrow;" the sacredness attached to certain horses, usually piebald or albino; sword worship; divination by means of a deer's shoulder blade; and the custom of burying living retainers about the tumuli of kings and nobles. Bashford Dean, in his "Catalogue of the Loan Collection of Japanese Armor," Metropolitan Museum of Art, N. Y., Handbook No. i4, 1903, p. 28, points out that the earliest metal armor of Japan, about 800o A. D., shows a relationship in many ways to that of central and eastern Russia. 24 Legge ("Chinese Classics," Vol. 5, P. 74) makes the interesting suggestion that a polysyllabic language may have been spoken among the pre-Chinese natives of Shantung. As is well known, Chinese is monosyllabic and tonal. 5I</page><page sequence="13">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Han in the southwest of the peninsula, only eventually to be beaten out again.25 That a similar raid, or series of raids, during the latter half of the second century of our era or thereabouts, should have been the means of introducing an Early Iron Age culture among the Wo, seems both possible and plausible. The most conspicuous feature of this period in Japan, next to the use of iron itself, was the practice of dolmen burial. A careful study of the avail- able data, both historical and archeological, points to Korea again, and probably to the northern rather than the southern portion of the peninsula, as the source whence was introduced into Japan this custom of burying the illustrious dead in megalithic chambers covered by vast mounds of earth. Dolmens, in general somewhat smaller and simpler in type than those of Japan, occur in Korea in large numbers, particularly in the north. Farther down in the peninsula their place tends to be taken by still simpler stone cists; but these contain horse trappings, stone models of metal swords and arrowpoints, and wheel-made pottery, all closely resembling and in most cases absolutely identical with corresponding remains in dolmen interments in Japan. It is matter of historical record, reinforced by archeological evidence, that this type of burial came to an end in Japan about the seventh or eighth century. Regarding the date of its beginning, however, opinions have been widely at variance, although generally speaking it has been placed far too early. While it is true that bronze and even stone objects have been found in connection with Japanese dolmen interments, that these are mere funerary survivals is shown by the fact that the vast majority of implements are of iron from first to last. The occurrence of horse trappings in these interments is of great significance. The Chinese records are most explicit to the effect that the people of Japan and of southern Korea at the beginning of the Christian era and for at least a century or two after had neither horses nor cattle. Hence, inasmuch as stirrups, bits, and other objects of iron are re- corded as occurring throughout the Dolmen Period, it follows that the latter itself can only date back to the epoch of the introduction of iron and the horse, somewhere apparently about the end of the second century. THE INTRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURE PROPER To what extent the primitive Japanese in days prior to the advent of metal depended upon planting for their subsistence we do not know; but the Chinese accounts afford evidence of what is otherwise intrinsically probable, that they possessed a hoe culture, carried on in all likelihood largely if not exclusively by the womenfolk. Under such a system, for several reasons, no very great growth of population could ever take place. It was only the introduction of true agriculture, which in southeastern Asia means the grow- 25 E.

This great advance in civilization was another ele- ment of that distinctive culture complex characterizing the Japanese Early Iron Age. That it too was derived from Korea is indicated, among other signs, by the entire absence in Japan of the water buffalo, the plow animal par excellence in the irrigated rice culture of China, and the use in its stead of a bullock of identical breed with that of the neighboring peninsula. FIG. 9 Fig. 10 FIG. 9-Japanese peasants digging edible bamboo shoots. The hat, raincoat, spade, hoe, and style of clothing are all traceable to the southern Chinese littoral. FIG. Io-Japanese rice culture, introduced from south and central China, perhaps by way of Korea. Women in Japan still perform a large part of the field work, just as in primitive times. (Photograph by courtesy of the Freer Gallery of Art.) Such a revolution in the economic life of a people as that implied by a change from a hoe to a plow culture has naturally its social aspects also. In hoe culture it is almost invariably the women who do the planting, while the men fish and hunt. No one exchanges the excitement and activity inci- dent to the career of a hunter or a deep-sea fisherman for the monotonous drudgery that falls to the plowman's lot save under strong compulsion of some sort. In other words, the bringing about of such a change almost neces- sarily implies the relationship of master and serf. That such a system ob- tained in the Japan of the Early Iron Age, we have abundant evidence.26 This fact affords additional presumption of conquest of some sort, whether from without or from within. 26 On this see, e. g., Hara, op. cit., pp. 80 et seq. 53</page><page sequence="15">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW HISTORICAL EVIDENCE FROM CHINESE RECORDS For such historical evidence as exists regarding this phase of Japan's cultural development we are still forced to rely almost wholly on the Chinese records. Writing seems to have been applied in Korea to the keeping of annals only toward the close of the fourth century of our era, and in Japan somewhat later still, so that what is told regarding earlier periods must rest solely upon oral tradition and legend.27 The histories of the Later Han and the Wei dynasties of China inform us that for a period of seventy or eighty years, ending about the close of the FIG. ii-Korean bullfight. These fights, originally of ritual significance, seem to have formed an element of the irrigated rice culture complex, in association with which they are found from Japan to Madagascar. second century, the people of.western Japan-from what cause, is not stated-were in great turmoil, the disturbances ending only with the rise of a powerful queen (almost certainly the "empress" Jing6 K6g6 of Japanese legend) who by her command of magic extended her authority far and wide over the various tribes of the Wo.28 She had, the accounts go on to say, no husband, but was assisted in governing by her brother-apparently an only partly understood instance of royal brother-and-sister marriage, a custom which we know formerly existed in Korea also.29 That a marked change of some kind, whether as the result of actual inva- sion or not, really did take place at this time is further shown by the fact that the Chinese records of the period sometimes refer to "Great Wo" by the alternative name of "the Queen Country," although declaring specifically 27 Maurice Courant, Stele chinoise du royaume de Ko Kou Rye, Journ. Asiatique, Ser. 9, Vol. n, 1898, pp. 210-238, states (pp. 223 et seq.) that writing became habitually used in western Korea in the last quarter of the fourth century. W. G. Aston, Trans. Asiatic Soc. of Japan, Vol. i6, [888, p. 46, thinks Chinese writing (there is of course no question of any other) was diffused in the various Korean kingdoms in the last half of the same century. C. E. Maitre, op. cit., p. 584, says writing was definitely introduced into Japan from Korea at the beginning of the fifth century. 28 See Murdoch, op. cit., Vol. i, pp. 36 et seq. 2l Hulbert, op. cit., p. 8i. 54</page><page sequence="16">HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAPAN that in earlier times it had been ruled over by kings. It seems to have been the case that these female rulers of the Wo derived their powers from a belief that they in some special sense-most likely through actual physical descent-represented the Sun Goddess, whose oracles and priestesses they were. It was about this same period, apparently, that there arose on the main island, in what was later the province of Izumo, an independent kingdom which had especially close relations with the country of Hsin-lo, or Silla, facing it across the Sea of Japan.30 It is perhaps in this Izumo region that is to be sought the land of Ko-nu, mentioned by contemporary Chinese writ- ers as situated across the sea from Ye-ma-t'ai (in Kyushu, as we have seen), and more to the eastward. The people of Ko-nu, we are further told, al- though of the same race as the Wo, were generally on terms of hostility with the latter, and unlike them were ruled over by a king, who was in diplomatic correspondence with the Chinese representatives in Korea. Thus it seems clear that beginning about the latter half of the second century western Japan was invaded from Korea by a decidedly high culture characterized by the use of iron, the manufacture of wheel-made pottery, the possession of domestic animals, the custom of fighting on horse- back, the practice of true agriculture, and the burial of the illustrious dead in dolmens covered by huge mounds of earth. It is possible that the bow played a part in the extension of this culture; for the original Mongoloid settlers of western Japan, like their kinsmen of the Chinese littoral and so many of the modern peoples of Indo-China and Indonesia, appear to have been spearmen rather than archers. Of the substitution of male rule for female rule among the Wo there is no historical record. But that it took place not long after the time of the great queen just mentioned, and that it was due to the growing influence of Chinese ideas, may be held as certain. The former divine queens seem to have survived merely as chief priestesses of the Sun cult, while the actual power was henceforth vested in the male heads of the ruling clan, the his- torical mikados, also of course descendants of the Sun Goddess and there- fore god-kings in their own persons. It was during this same period of her Early Iron Age that Japan received, through Korea but eventually from China, two fresh cultural acquisitions whose importance it would be difficult to exaggerate. These were the Buddhist faith and the art of writing. The story of the way in which these additional factors in the national life came to be introduced cannot be gone into here. But it will readily be seen how very great must have been their influence as unifying and civilizing agents among a congeries of tribes dwell- ing upon a relatively low culture plane and ruled over by a turbulent, dis- united, and illiterate aristocracy which had as yet learned to pay but small respect to the authority of the central government. 90 On the contact between Hsin-lo and the Izumo region of Japan, see Aston, Nihcngi, Vol. i, p. i66 and note; W.

It is possible, however, that even during the Neolithic period independent bands of the invaders may have cruised in canoes farther east- ward, planting settlements along the coast but leaving the central mountain ranges in the hands of the aboriginal population. We know that it was by this method of coastwise advance in large fleets of war boats that the Jap- anese effected the conquest of much of the northern part of the main island in the full light of the historical period, during the seventh and eighth cen- turies; and it must have been by a similar process that they acquired a lodgment in the islands in the first place.31 At all events there is some evi- dence, slight though it be and mainly of a legendary character, that the coastal plains as far east as Tokyo Bay were already occupied by settlements of peoples akin to but independent of the Yamato, when the latter estab- lished their supremacy there. The Yamato-dake story, for example, pure myth though it be in the main,32 suggests this; for in it that hero appears as warring against peoples kindred to his own until he passes the mouth of Tokyo Bay (traveling by sea, be it noted); it is only beyond that point that he is represented as coming in contact with the Ainu. It seems certain at any rate that the efforts of the Yamato to extend their authority over eastern Japan began very soon after their occupa- tion of the Lake Biwa region. For the Japanese annals, just now beginning to have some slight historical value, mention a defeat inflicted at the end of the fourth century upon one of their war parties by the Ainu of the rugged peninsular region between Tokyo Bay and the Pacific Ocean. And eighty years or so later-in the year 478 A. D., to be exact-the Chinese records inform us that the emperor then reigning, Shun Ti, of the Early Stung Dy- nasty, received a letter 33 from the ruler of the Yamato, stating that his father had conquered toward the east fifty-five states of the Maojen, or "hairy men" (the Ainu, of course), and on the west sixty-six states of the I-jen, or "barbarians." Who these latter were, is uncertain; but they were per- haps most likely fragments of the pre-Yamato population of western Japan, of mixed Ainu and Mongoloid descent, which, dwelling in mountainous areas or outlying islands, had managed hitherto to escape conquest by the Yamato. Southern Kyushu in particular we know long remained independent and hostile. The almost entire absence of dolmens here indicates the slight control exercised by the Yamato over this region during their Early Iron Age, and this inference is most abundantly confirmed by their own records. 31 Regarding these boat expeditions, see Aston, Nihongi, Vol. 2, pp. 252 and 263; also, Hara, op. cit., p. IIo. 32 For the Yamato-dake myth see Aston, Nihongi, Vol. I, pp. 200 et seq.; B. H. Chamberlain, Ko-ji-ki, pp. 20I and 205 et seq. 33 Thus showing that the Japanese were now beginning to conduct their diplomatic correspondence in writ- ing, if indeed they had not already been doing so for a century or two; but the art remained for long a secret confined to certain hereditary guilds of Chinese or Korean extraction, whose members thus acquired vast influence with the rulers and great nobles of the Yamato whom they served as scribes. 56</page><page sequence="18">HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAPAN Loss OF CONTINENTAL TERRITORY But, though the influence of the Mikados was being strengthened during this period in Japan proper, as much cannot be said with regard to' their relations with the continent. During much of the Early Iron Age western Japan and particularly northern Kyushu seem to have been far less closely allied in feeling to the Yamato region than they were to southern Korea. At times this consciousness of kinship actually took the form of alliances be- tween the peoples on the two sides of the Strait of Tsushima for waging war -"rebellion" in the official Japanese phraseology-against the divine Yamato rulers of central Japan. It was only by great efforts that the latter were able to maintain even the loosest control over. their kinsfolk of the lower end of the peninsula.34 Geography, in the shape of the hundred miles of sea between Japan and Korea, was working as inexorably against them as did the English Channel against the retention of Normandy by the English kings--in many ways a closely parallel case. Finally, in the latter half of the seventh century the age-long friendship between the kingdom of Hsin-lo, the ancient Shen-Han, and China, then under the sway of the powerful T'ang Dynasty, culminated in a joint attack upon the Yamato by sea and land, which resulted in their total expulsion from the peninsula. The people of Quelpart, of Japanese or closely kindred stock, kept up for several centuries a quasi-independent existence as the kingdom of T'am-na but eventually gravitated toward Korea, geographical propinquity proving stronger than the ties of race and culture. At the time, no doubt, this loss of the continental portion of their territory must have seemed a catastrophe of the direst sort. In the long run, how- ever, it proved of incalculable benefit.35 For, while receiving just as formerly the culture stimuli emanating from the continent, the Yamato no longer had to dissipate their energies in efforts to retain hold of regions on the mainland which were steadily growing farther apart from them in feeling and culture. Thus, able to give their undivided attention to their home prob- lems, they set to work in earnest to obliterate the last remaining frontiers within the Japanese islands themselves. FURTHER CONSOLIDATION OF THE INSULAR DOMAIN The independent communities still surviving in the west, of which those mentioned as existing in southern Kyushu were the chief, were absorbed in short order. The last rising of the old independent stock of southern Kyushu took place at the end of the seventh century, barely a generation after the expulsion of the Yamato from their last foothold on the continent. But the separatist tendencies of the region, fostered by its geographical configura- 34 On the dominance of Japan in Korea during the early centuries of the Christian era, see Kanichi Asakawa: The Early Institutional Life of Japan, Tokyo, 1903, pp. 8o et seq. 36 Hara, op. cit., pp. I22 et seq. 57</page><page sequence="19">FIG. 12 FIG.

The subjugation of the still unconquered Ainu of the north and east pre- sented a far more serious task. The mass of the people of western Japan, hardly touched by the new cultural influences from the continent, save in so far as these facilitated their exploitation by their rulers, had long since sunk to the status of abject predial serfdom and had lost such military vir- tues as they may once have possessed. The aristocracy, we know, were splendid warriors, gorgeously equipped and accustomed to fighting on horse- back with longbow and sword. When called out en masse they no doubt proved a most effective if somewhat undisciplined militia. But aside from the personal guards of the rulers and great nobles, recruited largely from the Ainu and the pre-Yamato populations of southern Kyushu, there was no standing army and consequently no force ready at all times to take the field on short notice against the sudden incursions of the unconquered aborigines. The,se fierce fighters were by no means content merely to act on the defen- sive. Throughout their history as an independent people they evinced an entire willingness to meet their enemies quite halfway. Their usual method of waging war was to strike the settlements of the foe unawares and then be off again with their booty and captives, leaving behind them a trail marked in blood and fire, before troops could be brought up against them. The attitude of the bulk of the Japanese peasantry toward these savage raiders is vividly reflected in a very ancient song, attributed to the mythical hero Jimmu, which says that one Emishi (i. e. Ainu) is a match for a hundred men. THE AINU FRONTIER It was clearly for strategic reasons that the Yamato had moved their seat of government in the first place from Kyushu to the frontier region about Lake Biwa. For it was there that Ainu incursions were most to be dreaded and there, too, that they could be most easily repelled before they had penetrated far into the country. That such a radical change of base should have been made, in spite of the very great importance which we know the Yamato rulers attached to the maintenance of their hold on southern Korea, gives us a measure of the anxiety with which they regarded the "Ainu ques- tion." Only a motive of the utmost cogency could have induced them to re- move so far from the position close to the Strait of Tsushima which they had hitherto occupied. The settlement of the Ainu problem was at length effected; but it was only by dint of the hardest fighting, protracted through centuries. The posses- sion of iron weapons and of a force of mounted archers accustomed to maneuver at a gallop over rough ground must have given the Yamato a great advantage over the Ainu in the open field. But as the latter were slowly pushed back northeastward they absorbed more and more of the civilization of their enemies with a consequent increase in their own powers of resistance, while the Yamato armies, on the other hand, advancing both by land and 60</page><page sequence="22">HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAPAN by sea, met with ever greater difficulty in getting up their supplies from the cultivated districts far in their rear. Moreover, it was not enough merely to occupy the lowlands near the coast with blockhouses and military colonies. The central mountain ranges had also to be invaded and their inhabitants dispossessed or subdued, if there was to be any security for the always length- ening lines of communication. In view of the overwhelming difficulties at- tending the task, it is no wonder that it was so long of accomplishment; while FIG. i6-Inscribed stone of the eighth century at the Taga fort, near the ancient Ainu Japanese- frontier, a few miles north of the modern city of Sendai. the dogged stubbornness with which the centuries-long battle was waged on both sides says a vast deal for the fighting qualities of Ainu and Yamato alike. For some reason progress was much more rapid on the west than on the east coast, so that about the close of the seventh century the Yamato had after a fashion occupied the territory along the Sea of Japan nearly up to the 39th parallel. On the Pacific side the Ainu were then holding out along a line roughly corresponding to latitude 37? N. The next few campaigns pushed the frontier back, on the west, as far as a spot a trifle south of lati- tude 40o N., where the Akita fort was built. From this point the boundary extended in a general southeasterly direction across the central mountain ranges to the Pacific, reaching the coast about in latitude 380 40' N., some fifty miles or so north of the Taga fort, whose overgrown earthworks still stand, not far from the present city of Sendai.36 36 On the successive old Yamato-Ainu frontiers, see Hara, op. cit., pp. 67 et seq., 86 et seq., 104, II9, 147 et seq.; N.

I66; idem, Prehistoric Japan, p. 597.</page><page sequence="23">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW At this point, in the latter half of the eighth century, the still uncon- quered Ainu made a desperate effort to regain their lost ground. They took the Taga fort, massacred its commander and garrison, and pushed far down the eastern coastal plain toward that Tokyo Bay region from which their ancestors had been driven something like three hundred years before. But the Yamato government, albeit with difficulty, kept large forces in the field year after year, while the aborigines, barbarians as they were, aided in their own subjugation by indulging in suicidal wars among them- selves. It was fortunate for them that the Yamato, before the loss of their continental possessions left them free to attend to their internal problems, had adopted the peaceful and humane creed of Buddhism with its aversion from bloodshed. For, in obedience to the behests of their faith, they carried on no mere war of extermination but made a genuine effort to' civilize and assimilate the conquered natives and to place them on the same footing with the other subjects of the Mikado. At first prisoners of war were distributed in the western part of the islands in small bodies and were given rations until they should learn to become self-supporting; while later on the policy was adopted of organizing them into villages on the same basis as the rural popu- lation elsewhere. Thousands of them, first-class fighting men as they were, accepted enrollment in the Japanese armies for service against their still unsubdued kinsmen. Offices and gifts were bestowed on surrendered chief- tains, while missionaries, in some cases themselves converted Ainu who had taken holy orders, made every effort to win the aborigines to the Buddhist faith. FINAL CONQUEST OF THE AINU Finally by the close of the tenth century the subjugation of the Ainu of the main island could be regarded as accomplished. But it was long be- fore they were completely assimilated. They rose again and again, even as late as I332, while a few villages of them were still to be found about the shores of Aomori Bay so recently as the eighteenth century. That portion of the race living in Yezo, Sakhalin, and the Kuriles retained its independence for some time longer. The last serious effort of the Yezo Ainu to expel the Japanese occurred in the latter part of the seventeenth century, when with their primitive weapons they made a brave but hopeless fight against their foes clad in iron armor and equipped with matchlock guns and keen steel swords. As a distinct people the Ainu have almost wholly disappeared, with the exception of the few thousands still living in the island of Yezo. Neverthe- less they form a very large element in the racial composition of the Japanese nation to this day.37 As usual in cases where crossing has occurred between 37 On the large Ainu part in the modern Japanese racial complex, see Kanichi Asakawa: The Origin of the Feudal Land Tenure in Japan, Amer.

Munro (Prehistoric Japan, p. 634) says the religion of the Yamato was much more deeply influenced by the Ainu than is generally supposed. 62</page><page sequence="24">HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF EARLY JAPAN Mongoloid and other races, the external physical characteristics of the former have tended to be dominant, although apparently the same does not hold to quite the same extent regarding skeletal traits. Traces of Ainu mix- ture are visible throughout the country, from the Loochoos and Satsuma in the far south to Yezo on the north, while in isolated regions like the moun- tain fastnesses of Kozuke, Shinano, and Echigo provinces in the center of the main island, there still occur surprising numbers of pure Ainu types. Particularly strong was this strain among the former Samurai, or knightly class, in large part descended from the Ainu incorporated in the Japanese armies of the eighth and ninth centuries.38 To this inheritance it was that the haughty two-sworded man of later times owed his less Mongoloid features, ruddier complexion, and heavier beard, to say nothing of his splendid fight- ing qualities. It would be difficult to exaggerate the influence which the Ainu have ex- erted over the historical development of the Japanese Empire. For to the long centuries of warfare which their subjugation entailed were due the rise of that hereditary warrior class and that system of military government, without which Japan would almost certainly have vegetated into a second Korea-in other words, a feeble imitation of China, without either the will or the force to think and act for herself. It is pleasant to be able to state, from personal observation, that the Japanese authorities are doing all that they can to elevate and educate the remnant of the Ainu and assist them to a point where they can take their proper place as civilized men and women in the world of the twentieth century. CONCLUSION The physical and cultural traits which we regard as peculiarly Japanese may, then, be traced to three separate and distinct geographical areas.39 Basically, both in race and in the fundamentals of their culture, the Japanese are most closely akin to the ancient inhabitants of the Asiatic coast lands during the Neolithic period. Superimposed upon this foundation and affecting mainly the ruling classes, was that higher type of civilization which began to reach Japan about the beginning of our era and which was accompanied by a certain infusion of fresh blood, largely from Korea but also to a not inconsiderable extent direct from China. Finally, to the long contact with the ancient aborigines were due the addition of a most valuable element in the racial complex and the acquisition of that fighting spirit, with its traditions of unflinching loyalty and self-sacrifice, that has been so largely responsible for the rise of Japan as a modern Power.- 38 Asakawa, Origin of Feudal Land Tenure, p. 17; Matsumoto, op. cit., pp. 75 et seq. 39 H. J. Fleure (Geographical Factors, Helps for Students Series, No. 44, London, 1921) makes the interest- ing suggestion that it may be the imperfect accord of widely separated inheritances in the same individual that has given the Japanese the sensitiveness to climatic differences which has hitherto stood in the way of their succeeding as colonists in Formosa or Sakhalin. 63</page></plain_text>
