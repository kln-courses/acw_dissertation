<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORDSWORTH'S MARGARET; OR THE RUINED COTTAGE To point out similarities in thought, style, and diction between the work of the French Romanticists of the late Eighteenth Cen- tury and the poetry of Wordsworth is by no means a difficult task, for, as one would suppose, it was from these French writers of the Continent that the English poet derived in part, at least, the thought and spirit that animated his work. It was not, however, entirely a pious and unreasoned reverence for these solitary wor- shippers of Nature which made Wordsworth the man he was. England herself, had, by the time of Wordsworth, begun to experi- ence a definite reaction from the super-conventionality of the times. That highly-wrought state of society which found its most bitter expression in class-hatred, and which resulted in the lordly exalta- tion of the rich and titled, and a merciless trampling of the poor and degraded-the artificial solidification of human life and insti- tutions, and the corresponding artistic cliche, which produced nothing more fit for poetic expression than that polished, but unflexible Popian couplet,-all this had a profound influence on the sensitive soul of Wordsworth. Both England and France, finding themselves involved in an iron net-work of conventionality, sought a similar escape from their toil,-a return to Nature. Rousseau's uncompromising insistence upon a return to Nature also expressed in substance the English Romantic spirit. Born of a reaction from artificiality, rationality, and high-strung city</page><page sequence="2">MARGARET; OR T7HE RUINED COTTAGE 461 life, the Romantic movement insisted first of all upon spontaneity and simplicity of thought and action. Goinig back to Nature meant, in the first place, a change of attitude from isociety to the individual. It meant -an abandonment of worldly pleasure and dignity for solitude, seclusioni, and simplicity of life. It mealnt a deep love and reverence for the naive,-a delight in the helpless, bright-eyed child; a joy in the tiniest woodland flower; a sermon in the rain-washed stone; and good in everything that had not been contaminated by the filth of the city. Lastly, it meant a new religion. The tlheology and dogma of the Eighteenth Century, attempting to justify a God as complex and brazen as the times that conceived him, was now swept awvay for a God of the valley, delighting in laughter of little children, and making his home with farmer and herdsman. Nature, in place of dogmatic theology, now became the way of approach to God. It was one of the pri- mary tenets of these early Romanticists that a far-reaching, tran- scendent knowledge would be imparted to the faithful w-orshipper of Nature,-that the mind in close communion with the beauties of Nature would grow in a wealth and power entirely denied to the mere discoursive kind. Thus in the Romanticist waUs combined the Pagan worship of Nature and the worship of that unseen anthropomorphic God which, deeply rooted in Hebraic theology, had had so marked an influence on the abstract mind of the Middle Ages. In reading Wordsworth's Margar et; or the Ruined Cottage, which the poet later incorporated in the first book of the Excursion, one is often reminded of Pautl et Virginie. Bernardin de Saint- Pierre was in no way a servile imitator of his forerunners, Rous- seau and Buffon. He struck out for himself into the field of Nature, observing and tabulating anew her varied laws, and seeking ever fresh and stimulating experience in the contemplation of her beauties. But in spirit he was a true son of Rousseau. In both Saint-Pierre's story of Paul and Virginia, and Words- worth's poem of Margaret may be observed those distinctly Roman- tic tendencies which we noted above. Of similarity in feeling, emotion, and thought, and, indeed, in attitude toward life in gen- eral little need be said. The scene of each story is laid amid the beauties and charms of a Nature which everywhere breathes of the spirit of God. It is life and communion with this Nature</page><page sequence="3">462 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES that brings to the peaceful and reverent inhabitants contentment, love, and joy. Without, in the cold, hard, rational world,-in the savage cities teeming with vice and sin-reigns discord, hate, and misery. Contentment and happiness come only with retire- ment from worldly pleasure, and endure only so long as these true children of Nature keep themselves unspotted from the world. As the affairs of the world slowly penetrate their quiet, peaceful abodes, then comes an evil that no virtue or goodness can withstand. In both stories it is solitude that frees the mind for the generous outpourings of the spirit of God. And this communion with Nature and solitude also brings with it an infinite tenderness, as well as an emphasis upon the more primitive and gentler emotions. It is a similarity in more specific details, however, that makes one feel that possibly Saint-Pierre's Paul et Virginie was one of the sources of Wordsworth's poem. To be sure, Wordsworth does not mention the Frenchman's story in the preface to his poem. But this fact need not trouble one. Wordsworth, who had proba- bly read the Frenchman's story many years before (some twenty- five or thirty years elapsed between the dates of composition), had, by the time he started his poem of Margaret, quite forgotten the details of the story, and would scarcely have recognized it as a possible source of his poem. How much the vitality and fertility of the imagination depends upon the subtle operations of the sub- conscious mind, it is hard to say. But this much we may say, that the unfolding of the imagination involved in artistic expres- sion is shrouded in deep mystery. The details of Saint-Pierre's story, though lost to outward memory, might well have become a part of the permanent possessions of Wordsworth's inner mind. The setting of each story is similar. The cottages, now in irreparable ruin as the tales begin, are withdrawn from the world, one, on an island in the Indian Ocean, where scarcely a murmur reaches it, but the ceaseless, muffled roar of the sea; the other, in England, in a less secluded spot, but almost equally removed from contact with city life. Wordsworth's description of the remains of AMargaret's cottage,- four naked walls That stared upon each other, compares well with the general impression given by Saint-Pierre of the ruined state of the abodes once loved by the two French</page><page sequence="4">MARGARET; OR THE BUINED COTTAGE 463 families. The one-time inhabitants had cast their lots amid the simple charms of Nature. But, as if not wholly satisfied with a Nature wild and unadorned, each family had cultivated gardens, which are quite distinct aind separate from the uncouth and untended wastes lying round about, although, as Saint-Pierre says of Paidl's garden, I1 ne s'etait pas dcart6 de celui [le plan] de la Nature. One might almost say that these gardens symbolize the prosperity, decline, and final ruin of those simple and reverent worshippers of Nature who had once cultivated them. While yet life is dear, and faith in the future keen for these people, their gardens bloom with delicate, exquisite beauty. But when misfortune and hard- ship come with the intrusion of the world without, then the flowers begill to wilt, the stalks to droop, and weeds and thorns quickly spring up, which choke all but a bare semblance of the beauty and loveliness that had once quickened the hearts of those unfortunate people. The similarity between Wordsworth's Pedlar and Saint-Pierre's Old MIan, both of whom narrate the stories in question, is too striking to escape the notice of even the superficial reader. This is the Frenlchman's description of his " homme deja sur age." "I1 etait, suivant la coutLtume des arnciens habitants, en petite veste et en long calegon. I1 marchait nu-pieds, et s'appuyait sur un baton de bois d'&amp;eb'ne. Ses cheveux etaient tout blancs, et sa physi- onomie noble et simple." With this description compare t-he following lines of Wordsworth about his pedlar: A man of reverend age, But stout and hale, for travel unimpaired. There was he seen upon the cottage bench, Recumbent in the shade, as if asleep; An iron-pointed staff lay at his side. Although differing much in phraseology, the descriptions in each case give one like impressions of two venerable old men. We must not assert too boldly. however, that the Old Man of Saint-Pierre's story it the prototype of Wordworth's Pedlar, for in the preface to his poem Wordsworth gives us a hint of the source of his char- acter. But it is interesting to observe that Wordsworth is here</page><page sequence="5">464 MODERN LANGUAGE NOTES not describing any single person he had ever known or seenl, but rather several persons. Just as the Old Man in Sainit-Pierre's story, we may believe, is a portrait of the author himself, who, unfitted by temperament to live in a society which showers its blessings only upon the flattering and obsequious, fled the irksome bonds of propriety and convention to take up his abode wi-ith a true and simple-hearted people; so the Pedlar of the opening book of the Excursion is, according to Wordsworth's own words, in part a picture of the man he himself would like to have beeln, had niot circumstances of birth and education guided him into other walks of life. In the same preface, Wordsworth speaks also of two other men he had once known who contributed to the picture of this char- acter,-one, an old Scotchman, named Patrick, a kinsman of his and a pedlar; the other, a pedlar whom he had known when a school boy, and who had made a deep impression upon his childish imagination. It is scarcely too much to say, I think, that the sage Old Man of Saint-Pierre's story also contributed his bit to Words- worth's Pedlar. It is not only in dress and physical appearalnce that these two old men resemble each other. Even more is a similarity apparent in the moral and spiritual sides of their natures. To be sure, the manner of characterization is in the case of each different. Words- worth devotes some ten pages (Aldine Edition) to a detailed description of the Wanderer's spiritual life, showing how from childhood to youth and youth to manhood, Nature had been the chief agent in forming the moral and intellectual possessions of the man. Instead of adopting this direct narrative method in dealing with his character, Sainit-Pierre choses rather to show us from the Old Man's attitude toward life, from his reactions to the sufferiligs and hardghips of others the kind of a person he really is. Both men, paragons of wisdom and virtue quite beyond their learning and station in life, have been ardent lovers and worshipers of Nature. And Nature who "never did betray the heart that loved her," lavish in the abundance of her blessings bestowed upon these simple children of hers, leaves nothing undone that might add to their spiritual, moral, and intellectual welfare. It is with a childish delight that these two men, so long separated from the outer world of action, tell their simple tales of happiness anld misfortune.</page><page sequence="6">MARGARET; OR THE RUINED COTTAGE 465 The name Margaret seems to have been a favorite with Words- worth, and appears to have responded to the poet's imagination as peculiarly befitting a person in humble station of life. In Paul et Virginie we see that Paul's mother is named Margaret,- a woman of less culture and refinement than the more religious and melancholy Madame de la Tour. Wordsworth wrote in the preface to his poem that " several passages describing the employ- ment and demeanor of Margaret during her affliction " he gleaned from certain observations which he had made in Dorsetshire and Somersetshire. But he also states that the character as a whole is composite, partaking of the traits and virtues of wiomen who had come under his direct observation, and of whom he had been told. Wordsworth's Margaret, however, resembles more closely Virginia's mother, Madame de la Tour, although Paul's mother, too, possesses many of those tender graces for which we love the English AMargaret. Of Madame de la Tour Saint-Pierre says, " Je trouvai dans madame de la Tour une personne d'une figure interessante, pleine de noblesse et de melancolie." In essence we find Wordsworth's description of Margaret similar. She was a woman of a steady mind, Tender and deep in her excess of love; Not speaking much, pleased rather with the joy Of her own thoughts: by some espec.al care Her temper had been framed, as if to make A Being, who by adding love to peace Might live on earth a life of happiness. These two pathetic stories of happiness and misfortune conclude in a similar wivay. Both listeners find in the gloomy recital of love and joy completely wiped out by cruel disaster a human experience that touches the depths of their souls. It is Wordsworth who in his simple, sincere lines expresses more delicately and poiglnantly than Saint-Pierre the effect of his tale of suffering upon his fellow-companion. The Old Man ceased: he saw that I was moved. From that loxv bench, rising instinctively I turned aside in weakness, nor had power To thank 'him for the tale which he had told. Saint-Pierre's rather blunt, matter-of-fact way of endingo his story lacks much of Wordsworth's simple dignity. 2</page><page sequence="7">466 IODERN LANGUAGE NOTES "Eni disant ces mots, ce bon vieillard s'6loigna en versant des larmes; et les miennes avaient coule plus d'une fois pendant ce funeste recit."
