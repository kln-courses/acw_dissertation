King Wayne State University STATIC BENDING CHARACTERISTICS of the human spine were recently reported by Nyquist and Murtón (1)* who used human volunteers as test subjects. Additional static data were provided by Mallikarjuna- rao et al (2) for the purpose of defining loading corridors during flexion, extension, and lateral bend- ing. Cadaveric and living human volunteer data were acquired. These studies were motivated by the need to obtain information on spinal kinematics for the design of a human-like surrogate spine. This spine should be adaptable to existing anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) which are currently equipped with a rigid thoracic f spine and a relatively flexible TlumbarT segment. Since ATDTs are used in an impact environ- ment, it is necessary to study the dynamic response of the human spine. This paper provides kinematic data of cadaveric spinal response during -Gx acceler- ation. The relative rotation of TI, T12 and the pelvis was measured along with seat pan loads and moments. These data were used to establish the relative flexi- bility of the thoracic and lumbar spines and to quantify resistance to flexion as a function of a hip- joint moment. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES COORDINATE SYSTEMS - The design of a sur- rogate spine requires the definition of body-fixed *Numbers in parentheses denote references at end of paper. anatomically related coordinate systems to describe the location of the spine relative to known anatomical landmarks. An ad hoc Committee of the International Workshop on Human Subjects for Bio mechanical Re- search made recommendations for coordinate sys- tems for the head, T1 and the pelvis. That for the head and T1 were first described by Ewing and Thomas (3). Figure 1 shows the T1 coordinate system taken from (3). Its positive x-axis is a directed line seg- 7 Fig. 1 - T1 anatomical coordinate system -, ABSTRACT Spinal kinematics and kinetics of human cadaver- ic specimens subjected to -Gx acceleration are re- ported along with an attempt to design a surrogate spine for use in an anthropomorphic test device (ATD). There were a total of 30 runs on 9 embalmed and 2 unembalmed cadavers which were heavily instrument- ed. External photographic targets were attached to TI, T12, and the pelvis to record spinal kinematics. The subjects were restrained by upper and lower leg clamps attached to an impact seat equipped with a six-axis load cell. A rigid link 486 mm long and pinned at both ends was proposed for use in an ATD as a surrogate spine. An optimization method was used to obtain the location and length of a linkage which followed the least squares path of T1 relative to the pelvis. 3166 0096-736X/79/8704-31 66$02.50 Copyright © 1979 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">ment connecting the midpoint of the superior and in- ferior corner of the posterior spinous process of T1 to the anterior-superior border of the vertebral body where the origin is located. The positive z-axis extends superiorly and is normal to the x-axis in the mid-sagittal plane which contains the above three points. The positive y-axis is directed laterally and to the left, forming a right-handed coordinate sys- tem. It is normal to the x-z plane. The same system can be used for T12. The pelvic coordinate system has been described in detail by Padgaonkar (4) and is shown in Figure 2*. To locate this system with respect to the pelvis, it is necessary to define a triangular plane with vertices at the right and left anterior superior iliac spine and the midpoint of the upper edge of the public symphysis. Its positive x-axis is normal to the plane and passes through the origin which is located at the midpoint of the line joining right and left anterior superior iliac spine. The positive y-axis is along this line directed leftward, and the positive z-axis is perpendicular to the x-y plane, directed approximately in the inferior-superior direction. The sled reference frame is also a right-handed coordinate system with the x-y plane parallel to the flat bed surface of the sled. Its positive x-axis is directed forward, in the direction of motion of the sled and the positive z-axis is directed upward, perpendicular to the x-y plane. For a forward-facing seated subject, the x-axis of the sled is approximately along the posterior-anterior direction.

For the nine -ac cele rome ter modules, the coordinate system described by Padgaonkar et al (5) is used. When a module is mounted on a body segment, an attempt is made to designate the axis closest to the inferior-superior direction as the z-axis. TEST SUBJECTS - Eleven cadaveric specimens were used in this experimental test series. Nine of them were embalmed and two were unembalmed. Pertinent information regarding these cadavers is given in Table 1. There were 5 male and 6 female cadavers, with an age range of 52 to 74 years. Anthropometric measurements were made on each subject, using a predetermined list. Whole body x-rays were taken to ensure that there were no pre- existing fractures and to identify the vertebrae to be instrumented.

All others are embalmed. Radio-opaque markers in the form of thumb tacks were placed near T1 and T12 along the mid-sagittal plane to pinpoint the location of the laminae of these vertebrae on x-ray. A threaded Steinmann pin was then inserted into each lamina of T1 and T12 to act as anchors for the instrumentation mount. The same technique was used for the pelvic mount which was located opposite S2. This method of installing instru- mentation mounts was found to be simple, fast and reliable. The cadaver could be lifted off the table via the T1 Steinmann pins without slippage. There was thus reasonable assurance that the motion of the mount reflected that of the vertebra on which the mount was located. INSTRUMENTATION - Each test subject was instrumented with a nine-accele rome ter module at TI, T12 and the pelvis, using Steinmann pins as anchors. A photographic target in the form of a cube was attached to each module. A typical T1 mount is shown in Figure 3. The configuration of the nine accelero me ter s was given by Padgaonkar et al. (5) for the measurement of angular acceleration and velocity. High speed cameras were located laterally, posteriorly and overhead the seated subject 3167</page><page sequence="3">3168 N. K. MIT AL, ET AL. Fig. 3 - Tl mount with cubic target to monitor motion of the targets. Other instrumenta- tion included a sled accelero me ter, a six-axis seat pan load cell, a sled velocity transducer and a time synchronization indicator to match film data with transducer data. SLED FACILITY - All experiments were carried out on WHAM III (Wayne Horizontal Accelerator Mechanism), a flat bed sled which was accelerated to the desired speed at low acceleration levels and was made to impact a programmable hydraulic snub- be r. The impact seat and associated equipment are shown in Figure 4. The subject was seated upright and restrained by clamps which held its upper and lower legs firmly to the seat. A lapbelt was added to restrain the pelvis after several femoral fractures resulted from relatively low levels of impact. A piece of 140 mm thick urethane foam was placed above the lap of the test subject to cushion the im- pact of the torso on the thighs and to prevent exces- sive flexion of the torso. It was necessary to avoid skeletal fractures for repeated runs, generally at increasing g-le vels. Furthermore, these cadaver runs were a prelude to living human volunteer runs which were scheduled for this study. The net and belts behind the subject were designed to prevent rearward rotation of the torso during rebound, with- out causing any injury to the test subject or damage to the accelerometer mounts. TEST PROCEDURES - Upon completion of all preparatory work on a cadaver, it was seated on the sled and restrained by the leg clamps and the lap- belt. All transducers were balanced and calibrated before each run was made. After each run, whole- body x-rays were taken to determine any fractures Fig. 4 - Sled setup on WHAM III with an ATD as test subject that might have occurred. If no fractures were found, a second run at a predetermined higher g-level was made. Fracture of a major bone, such as the femur of a vertebra, terminated the test series. Occasion- ally, a cadaver would łsurvivef a high g-level run and was used at lower g-levels in subsequent runs to fill out the test matrix. RESULTS ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA - Anthropometric dataof interest consist of the lengths of the thoracic and lumbo-sacral spines. They were measured by palpation of the coccyx and the spinous processes of T12 and C7. The subjects were in a prone position. These dimensions were required to determine the length of a surrogate spine which was representative of this sample. The spinal data are shown in Table 2. The total length ranged from 515 to 698 mm. The mean and standard deviation were 596. 3 and 57. 8 mm respectively. A normalizing factor was computed for each spine by dividing its length by the average length. The factors are shown in the last column of Table 2. EXPERIMENTAL DATA - The g-levels exper- ienced by each cadaver are shown in Table 3 which divides the runs into 3 broad groups. The 12 low g runs were made at a nominal level of 5g with thè ex- ception of one run which was made at 3g. There were 8 runs in the intermediate 10g group (7-13 g) and 10 runs in the 15 - 30 g group. The peak g-levels of those in the last group are indicated next to the run number.

Figure 6 shows a combined plot of 7 runs on 7 different embalmed cadavers impacted at a nominal deceleration of 5g. Reproducibility of the data can be considered good, particularly during the first 150 ms of the impact, at which time the torso interacts with the lap cushion and more variation in the traces is to be expected. For the nominal lOg runs on embalmed cadavers, the acceleration traces are shown in Figure 7. The corresponding data for embalmed cadavers are shown in Figure 8.

K. MITAL, ET AL. FILM DATA - The rotation and displacement of cubic film targets were measured from high-speed film using a Vanguard film analyzer. A computer program analyzed the data and plotted the position and rotation of TI, T12 and pelvic target with respect to an inertially-fixed frame or with respect to each other. The data can also be transformed to a speci- fied body-fixed reference frame. The program checks for errors in the film data, thus improving their accuracy. Figure 9 show target motion of TI, T12, and the pelvis relative to the inertial reference frame, for a run made on a male em- balmed cadaver. The targets are represented by solid lines during flexion and by dotted lines during extension. Figure 10 shows the motion of T1 and Fig. 9 - Motion of the TI, T12 and Pelvic target relative to the inertial reference frame for Run 306 Fig. 10 - Relative motion of T1 and T12 with respect to the pelvis and T1 with respect to T12 for Run 306 T12 relative to each other as well as to that of the pelvic target. It indicates that the T12/pelvis is much smaller in comparison with that of T1/T12 or Tl/pelvis. Figure 11 and 12 show the target motion for an unembalmed female cadaver. If Figures 8 and 12 are compared, it is seen that for an unem- balmed cadaver, the relative motion of the targets is much larger than that of an embalmed cadaver. Figure 11 also shows that for an unembalmed cadaver, the target motion during rebound or exten- sion did not follow the flexion trajectory as closely as that of an embalmed cadaver. LOAD CELL DATA - A six-axis load cell was used to measure seat pan forces and moments.

The sled-fixed coordinate system was used to define the components of forces and moments measured by this load cell. Since the impacts were principally two-dimensional, Fx and Fz in Figure 13 and My in Figure 14 were used in data analysis. It can be seen from these figures that Fy, Mx and Mz are all small. DATA ANALYSIS SPINAL FLEXIBILITY - In order to design a surrogate spine which simulates the kinematics of cadaveric spines, it is necessary to delineate the principal characteristics of vertebral motion during impact. One of the obvious parameters is relative rotation of the targeted vertebrae with respect to each other and to the pelvis. It was found that the thoracic spine underwent an initial extension due to inertial loading. This occurred before extensive torso flexion took place. The total relative rotation of T1 with respect to T12 was taken to be the sum of maximum extension and flexion. Data for 19 runs are shown in Table 4. The lumbar spine showed less DOT306. 5 FX FILTER 100 HZ. _ FY £ļ - FZ K| lO J ' o 00 LU ¡3"i / g» ^ I 1 1 -I Ą 0. 15. 30. 45. 60.

Thus, the thoracic spine is apparently more flexible than the lumbar spine. However, the measured relative rotation is the sum of the rotations of individual vertebrae at the intervertebral joints. The true flexibility of each segment should reflect the number of joints in each segment. A unit rotation is defined as the average rotation of each joint required to attain the total relative rotation and is computed by dividing the total rotation by the number of joints involved, 6 for the lumbar segment and 11 for the thoracic spine. The values for the unit rotation are comparable for the two segments, in the case of the embalmed cadavers. However, the lumbar spines of the two unembalmed cadavers tested are more flexible than the thoracic spine. RESISTANCE TO FLEXION - While the sled is in motion, an analysis of the forces and moments at the hip joint during forward flexion can only be made with the aid of complex mathematical models, such as the crash victim simulators. However, after the sled has come to rest, the analysis is great- ly simplified. Although the torso is still undergoing flexion and extension, providing seat pan loads and moments, an equation of static equilibrium can be written for that portion of the body which is firmly strapped to the seat; that is, the lower torso, below the hip joint. With the aid of Figure 15, an expres- sion for the resultant hip joint moment, Mr, can be derived: Mr = My - Fz . Xl - Fx . Zl where My = seat pan moment about the sled fixed z-axis Fx and Fz = seat pan loads along the sled fixed x- and z-axis XL and ZL = moment arms as shown in Figure 15 Calculation of this moment can begin at approximately 125 ms after the initiation of impact, as shown in Figure 5, for a 10g run (Run No. 306). The point is marked in Figure 5 at about 180 ms along the ab- scissa. The resultant moment, MR and the other terms in the static equilibrium equation are shown in Figure 16 for Run No. 306. The corresponding rotation of T1 with respect to the pelvis (Angle 0) as a function of time, for the same run, is shown in Figure 17. Plotting Mr against 0 results in a curve defining the stiffness of the spine. For Run No. 306, the curve is shown in Figure 18 for an embalmed spine. A cubic spline interpolation program was required to obtain equally spaced film data samples compatible with the digital load cell data before a crossplot could be made.

This curve was filtered at 100 Hz. It is possible to eliminate the 'reversed* hysteresis loop by using a 10 Hz filter but there is a severe degradation of peak amplitudes at this frequency. The hysteresis loop is very large for an unembalmed cadaver, as shown in Figure 19. The energy dissi- pated is estimated to be approximately 200 N-m. A DESIGN APPROACH FOR A SURROGATE SPINE The data acquired from these experiments can be used to make an initial design of a surrogate spine suitable for installation in an existing ATD. One of the constraints is the requirement for a rigid thoracic spine in an ATD to facilitate the design of a more human-like rib cage. However, both the thoracic and lumbar spines show considerable flexi- bility and in the case of the embalmed cadavers, the DOT306.5 T1.URT.P o, 00 ļ - ~8 x"/ i - x'^ / 2:0.

There is also the over- riding consideration that surrogate spines must satisfy the dual requirements of repeatability and reproducibility. It must, therefore, be simple in design yet realistic in response. A method for the synthesis of a planar linkage joining two rigid bodies was developed by Sarkisyan et al. (6) who proposed a means to determine the length and locations of the pivot points of a rigid link which will enable one body to move relative to the other along a predetermined path. The method minimizes the error between the actual and desired path in the least squares sense. This procedure can be applied to the design of a surrogate spine. One of the rigid bodies is the pelvis while the other is the upper torso, defined relative to the T1 coordinate system, as shown in Figure 20. An optimization procedure is required to minimize the error between the path taken by the surrogate spine and that measured during the ex- perimental runs. The ninth order equation developed by Sarkisyan et al. (6) can have a maximum of 9 possible links for a given path of T1 relative to the pelvis. An efficient Neider- Meade optimizer devel- oped by Wong et al. (7) was used to determine the optimal link. It finds the length of the link, R, and the coordinates of the pivot points on each body, Xp and Yp in the pelvic coordinate system and Xx and Yx relative to the origin of the T1 coordinate system, as shown in Figure 20. In view of the possibility of multiple solutions, it is essential to make intelligent guesses for the initial values of these 5 quantities. Differences in spinal column length was accounted for by obtaining a normalized desired path, using the normalizing factors computed in Table 3. Normalized data from 20 runs were put through the optimizer and the results are shown in Y A y X *Tv© ' a£íií--»* //r Xp // k P1 1 &gt; X Fig. 20 - Diagram for a planar linkage</page><page sequence="9">3174 N K MĪT AĪ FT AÏ Figure 21 and Table 5. The average link was ob- tained by averaging the values of Xp, Yp, Xp, Yp and R for the 20 sets of data points. This link was found to be 486 mm long. Its pelvic pivot is located 208 mm behind and 8 mm below the origin of the pelvic coordinate system, along the x- and y-axis respectively. The upper torso pivot is located 127 mm behind and 80 mm above the origin of the T1 coordinate system, along the x- and y-axis respec- tively. It is seen from Figure 21 that the link as computed from the optimization program lies outside the profile of a 50th percentile ATD. A proposed feasible link can be located within the dummy as shown by the dotted line by translating both pivot points anteriorly 100 mm as shown in Figure 21. A scaled paper model for the proposed feasible link was con- structed to check for its ability to track the motion of T1 relative to the pelvis, measured from film data. The link performed satisfactorily. CONCLUSIONS 1. Cadaveric data on the range of spinal motion during -Gx impact acceleration have been acquired. 2. Kinematic data useful for the design of a surrogate spine included relative rotation of T1 and T12 with respect to the pelvis and to each other and acceleration of TI, T12, and the pelvis. 3. The dynamic flexural resistance for the spine was also measured, using a six-axis seat pan load cell. 4. The total relative rotation of the thoracic spine was generally larger than that of the lumbar spine.

The unembalmed lumbar spine was more flexible than the thoracic spine but this conclusion is based on 7 runs and 2 cadaveric subjects. Living human volunteer data will be required to determine whether the embalmed or the unembalmed spinal data are more human-like. Both types of spines lack muscle tone but the rigidity of the embalmed spine may be able to simulate some muscular action. 5. A design approach to a surrogate spine for an existing ATD was proposed. Using a planar linkage synthesis method, the proposed spine was found to be 486 mm long and was located along the posterior aspects of the ATD torso. A complete design requires the incorporation of joint resisting torques and joint stops to simulate the actual motion of T1 relative to the pelvis.
