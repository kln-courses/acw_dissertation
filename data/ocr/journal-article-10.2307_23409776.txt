<plain_text><page sequence="1">Representing the Body Politic: Status, Gender; and Anatomy in Eighteenth-Century Society Islands Art The DISCUSSION OF the social and spiritual signifi cance of the arts and material culture is a subject of central importance in the study of Polynesian cul tures.1 In general, studies of the relationship between art and social status in Polynesia have stressed the normative role of the arts in a static socio-economic model, so that the visual arts have been interpreted as merely reflective of status rather than actively engaged in its determination. However, as Colin Newbury (1967:10) has pointed out, early sources show that Eastern Polynesian cul tures like Tahiti were far from being settled societies in which the political and economic implications of rank were harmoniously accepted. In particular, Adrienne Kaeppler (1989:212) has drawn attention to what she calls the "aesthetics of inequality," observing that the arts are embedded so deeply into Polynesian social forms that they help define the dimensions of inequality in these highly stratified societies. In this paper I will discuss a few of the ways in which the representation of the human anatomy in the visual arts referred metaphorically and metonymically to the ancestry and ancestral power that made status and privilege possible. Tahitian sources themselves suggest a dynamic social role for the arts. One of the few extant records of indigenous conceptions of the visual arts in Tahiti is contained in a prayer that formed part of the cer emony called pa'i-atua, the assembling and uncov ering of the gods, which was performed at the marae on occasions such as the inauguration of titlehold ers (Henry 1928:157). Recited bythe priests and wor shippers together, this prayer speaks of the unu, carved boards, incorporating the figures of animals, people and birds, and terminating in fork-like prongs said to represent the hand of the god (Rose 1971:1215). Anne D'Alleva Department of Art History and Archeology, Columbia University Tahu'a: 'Ei fa'i to unu, ei ite to unu." ( Opure e tahua paaro'a): "E i'oa, e i'oa fa'i nua, ratou te fa'i nua i te rave a re ta'ata nei." Priests: "Thy carved ornaments are to tell, they are witnesses." Worshipers and priests uniting: "Names, names will they disclose above, they will dis close the deeds of men."2 (Henry 1928:170) This vision of sculpture as a dynamic participant in the communication between human and divine may help illuminate the social role of symbolic action in Tahiti. Elite titleholders used art forms as diverse as figurai sculpture and royal regalia to max imize their power and prestige through visual refer ences to the ancestors and tutelary deities who helped them. Elite Bodies and the "Body Politic" The discussion of anthropomorphic representation in Tahiti must begin with a consideration of the social, spiritual, and ritual constructions of the human body. In Tahiti, a human being was believed to consist of a corporeal body (tino) that disinte grated at biological "death," along with a soul (varua) that usually survived the death of the body, and an essence (iho) (Oliver 1974:409). Personal effects, such as the umbilicus, hair cuttings, nail par ings, and even worn-out clothes were regarded as carrying the essence of the body, and were carefully disposed of in the marae by people of all ranks (Henry 1928:143).5 The socialization of the body was a focus of rituals such as the "head-freeing" cere monies (amo'a) which removed the potent spiritual power of the young — and tattooing, performed in adolescence, which may have had its own cosmo logical associations (Morrison 1935:186-187, 221-222; Beaglehole 1962:1:309; Shore 1989:166).

Mitchell Library, National Library of New South Wales, Sydney. The body of an ari i, an elite man or woman, was itself a nodal point for the intersection of the human and the divine. The body of a titleholder can be con ceptualized as a "body politic" that was charged with a particularly strong spiritual essence derived from powerful ancestors. Its function and condition had a significance for the kin group and the district as a whole. Douglas Oliver (1974:1049) notes that there was a belief in Tahiti in a mystical connection between a chief and the welfare of the people. Political and religious ritual often centered on these elite bodies, underscoring the fact that they had been assigned a pivotal role in perpetuating life and main taining the social order. For example, at the inaugu ration of the ari'i rahi, the highest-ranking title holder, the focus of the ceremony was the wrapping of his genitals in the maro 'ura, the sacred feather loincloth, depicted in a watercolor by William Bligh (Figure i). The direct conjunction between this loin cloth and the titleholder's genitals emphasized the wearers function as perpetuator of a descent "line" (Oliver 1974:763). This concept of the "body politic" was also expressed through the preservation and deployment of relics of important ancestors. Great care was exer cised in safeguarding a titleholder's mortal remains Figure 2. "The Body of Tee, a Chief, as preserved after Death, in Otaheite," engraving by W. Byrne after John Webber, 1784. (private collection) 28 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">from an enemy, particularly before a successor had been named to the office (Oliver 1974:1049). The preserved body itself became a kind of work of art, the center of aesthetic rituals, since it was bathed in coconut oil, wrapped in fine bark cloths, and dis played in a shelter — the fare tupapa'u, — draped with bark cloth (Figure 2). Relics such as fingernails were worn by the descendants, and one of the most highly valued was the hair of the deceased, finely braided and worn as a turban by women when they danced (Wilson 1788:329; Morrison 1935:508; Beaglehole 1962:1:338-339). Not surprisingly, the head provided many relics, for it was the part of the body most fully charged with a person's spiritual essence and power. The skulls of both enemies taken in battle and illustrious ancestors were preserved in the marae; the spirits of the deceased became fami ly gods or guardian spirits ('oromatua maitatai) who entered into their own skulls in order to help their descendants (Henry 1928:201-202). Thus, these relics functioned as a kind of material synecdoche, the body part serving as a reminder of the whole per son and charged with that person's spiritual essence. The practice brings to mind Michel Feher's (1989:16) recent observation that the metaphor of the organ works to naturalize a political institution or social hierarchy, for these relics were "living proof," so to speak, of the ancestry that allowed titleholders to claim their prerogatives and achieve success. The Body and Representation The "body politic was incorporated into the arts not only physically but also iconographically. Perhaps the most striking example of sculptural forms that quote the human anatomy in métonymie fashion are the fan handles that serve as insignia of rank for the most powerful titleholders. A fan han dle in the Metropolitan Museum collection and another in the Raymond Wielgus collection at the University of Indiana were given by the sovereign Pomare II to the Reverend Thomas Haweis, founder of the London Missionary Society, in 1818 (Figure 3). In the letter that accompanied his gift, Pomare II described the use of these fans: "I also send you two little fans which the Royal Family of these countries were accustomed to fan themselves with. When the day of the Festival arrived and the King was prayed for, those were the Fans they used to fan away the flies" (Pomare II 1820:81-83). Figure 3. Fly Whisk Handle. Ivory. The Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Collection, Purchase, Nelson A. Rockefeller Gift, 1965. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. July 1996 29</page><page sequence="4">Carved of whale ivory, the shaft of the Metropolitan Museum fan handle is clearly ren dered as a spinal column. The openwork evokes stacked vertebrae, an effect heightened by the mate rial from which it is made and by the fact that the shaft is carved in segments and lashed together. Each of these sections is carved to represent multiple, abstract human figures (Wardwell 1967:33). Adrienne Kaeppler has argued persuasively that spinal imagery in Hawai'i and Easter Island had genealogical significance (I9°2)&gt; and it may be that this fly whisk presents an image of the successive generations of ancestors, accumulated one upon the other like vertebrae.^ During public rituals, the fans imagery may have served as a potent reminder of the genealogy of the titleholder who wielded it. The spinal motif was also evoked in boundary figures, such as the one shown in a watercolor by George Tobin (Figure 4). These figures were used to mark regional divisions and the sacred precincts of a titleholder's dwelling: Figure 4. Boundary-marker. Watercolor by George Tobin, 1792. Mitchell Library, National Library of New South Wales, Sydney. A ti i, or carved image, fixed on a high pedestal, and placed by the road-side, at a short distance from the dwelling, marked the boundary of the sacred soil. All travellers pass ing these houses, on approaching the first image, stripped off the upper part of their dress, and, whether the king was residing there or not, walked uncovered to the imaee at the opposite boundary. After passing this, they replaced their poncho, or kind of mande, and pursued their journey (Ellis i83i:III:io6) Thus, the boundary figures worked metaphori cally in two ways. The construction, with figures stacked one on top of the other, is evocative of the spine, a metaphorical reference to the genealogy of the titleholder in much the same way as the stacked, abstracted figures of the fan handle. In addition, the sculpture substitutes for the titleholder in his or her absence, serving as a metaphor for him, a represen tation of the body politic to which the classic ges tures of respect are redirected. The Role of Gender Any discussion of anatomy leads to the issue of gen der, which Bradd Shore (1989:159) has recently pro posed as a fundamental category of analysis for Polynesian cultures, noting that it is gender, under stood abstractly, that underlies much of the dualis tic thinking encountered in Polynesia. Yet the role played by gender in visual communication is para doxical. Certainly many figures extant in museum collections are clearly sexed; the Dolphins shipmas ter, George Robertson (1948:191), observed in 1767, "...they are non of the finest carvers but they take care to îmetate nature so hxact, that no man can mis take the sex which they mean to represent...." Even the more abstract sennit-covered figures, known as too, incorporate references to gender. While Simon Kooijman (1964) has remarked on the phallic shape of many to '0 figures, which sometimes include male genitals in the anatomical features rendered in relief on the cylindrical surface, another such figure, in the British Museum, can be considered to evoke female genitals (Figures 5, 6). Yet there are also many instances in which the gender of a figure is not clearly indicated. The cele brated British Museum carving, which probably served as an ornament for an élite canoe, includes 30 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="5">two pairs of figures, none of which is explicitly gen dered (Figure 7). Of course, it may be that a figure did not have to include recognizable secondary sex ual characteristics in order to be gendered, tor such figures may have rendered themselves explicit to a Tahitian viewer in ways that we cannot perceive. However, anatomical details may have been erased to give the figures more flexibility as representations of ancestors or family gods. Marshall Sahlins (1985:20) has observed that lineages in Polynesia should be properly thought of as functioning by ascent rather than descent, as a person picked his or her way upward through the ancestral line to those ancestors who would justify the claiming of titles and prerogatives. Since several important titles could only be passed on by women (Gunson 1964:57-59), it may be that a generalized, non-gen dered figure provided a visual flexibility analogous to the genealogical flexibility exercised by the élite as they claimed their various privileges.

Carving (canoe ornament?). Wood. British Museum, London. 32 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="7">This kind of equivocal visual representation may also be linked to the fact that dualistic codes of gen dered behavior were often suspended with regard to the most high-ranking women, who played an active role in political life. These women usually did not have to observe many of the restrictions which fell on other women. For example, the Bounty mutineer James Morrison (1935:229) observed, "No Woman Can eat in a house where a Chief has been, unless she is of the same rank and authority with Him and then she mav Eat in his presence...." The fact that these women often had as servants ma.hu, that is, men who lived and dressed as women (ibid:238), underscored the extent to which normative, dualis tic gender patterns were suspended for them. It may be then, that the graphic depiction of gender was also suspended when it came to depicting female ancestral figures in certain types of sculpture, since these women did not act as typical women and their behavior was regulated as much by status as by gen der. Like the British Museum canoe carving, many sculpture forms that exhibit this sexual ambiguity are based on the theme or the pair, which, even if they are meant to represent male-female ancestral couples, are composed of identical elements. Conclusion To return briefly to Pomare lis fan handles, this principle may help explain the striking backward bending posture of the figures that surmount them, for it is not only the anatomy but its disposition that is of significance. In an artistic tradition with fairly rigid conventions for the depiction of gods and ancestors, an aberrant figure such as this may have served as a visual reminder or tne extent to wnicn normative patterns were suspended for the title holders who used these fans, just as the mahu who associated with powerful, high-ranking women underscored their unusual role in society. 5 The aris tocratic figures present a distinct contrast to the composure and gravity for which the élite were noted: "...the chiefs, the persons of hereditary rank and influence in the islands, are, almost without exception, as much superior to the peasantry or common people, in stateliness, dignified deport ment, and physical strength, as they are in rank and circumstances..." (Ellis 1831:1:82).^ Continued contact with foreign explorers and traders prompted innovations in the arts in Tahiti, just as the introduction of hrearms altered the way in which status was determined. The landing of English missionaries, who carried with them inflex ible ideas about religion and social organization, opened the way for further changes. The presence of these foreigners stimulated profound changes that laid the basis for the development of a Christian and monarchical society in 19th-century Tahiti, which had in some respects very different ideas about sta tus and gender as well as art.

(See note by Editors to article by Brigitta Hauser Schâublin in Pacific Arts Nos. 11/12, p.9) —The material is drawn from my dissertation, and I would like to thank Professors Natalie Boymel Kampen, Suzanne Preston Blier, and Annette B. Weiner, for their contributions to the continuing development of this work. I would also like to thank the Metropolitan Museum of Art for granting me a Jane and Morgan Whitney Fellowship in the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, providing both institutional support and travel funds. Additional research was made possible by Marcia and John A. Friede Fellowships in Oceanic Art in 1991 and 1992, for which I am most grateful. Dorota Starzecka of the Museum of Mankind, London, kindly allowed me to study the Society Islands holdings in January 1993; Jill Hasell, museum assistant was also very helpful. 2. Henry translates ta 'ata as "men," although the gender-neutral "people" or "humanity" would be preferable, since the 1851 London Missionary Society Dictionary notes specifically that ta'ata indicates "human beings, male or female" (Davies 1991:238). 3. This reference indicates that iho may be analo gous to the concept of mana as it existed in other Polynesian cultures, and it is not clear what the relationship is between the concepts of mana and iho within the Society Islands. The term mana was also used in Tahiti to express the idea of power, ultimately of divine origin and inherited July 1996 33</page><page sequence="8">from the ancestors, which could have both super natural and political aspects (Oliver 1974:68-69). 4. This principle is also embodied in the manufac ture of the maro 'ura, to which a lappet was added with the accession of each new titleholder. 5. Hawaiian royal possessions such as bowls and drums, also incorporate "acrobatic" figures that may have had a similar meaning. 6. The legendary princess Huri-te-monoi "...walked with a regal step upon the mats from the seashore and into the house and saluted with dignity the members of the royal family, accepting with grace their tokens of respect" (Henry 1928:614).
