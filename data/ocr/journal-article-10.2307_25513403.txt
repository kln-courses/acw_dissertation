XVI, SIXTH SERIES) THE EARLY CROSSES OF EAST AND WEST MEATH. By Henry S. Crawford, m.r.i.a., Fellow. [Submitted April, 1926.] COUNTY MEATH?(Continued). VI.?Kells. THE most important group of crosses in the county is situated here. In the churchyard there are three, more or less broken, and the base of a fourth; a fifth cross stands in the centre of the town. Their ornament dates them to the first half of the tenth century. The East Cross is 14 feet in height from the ground, not including the top arm and segments of the ring which are lost.8 Of the part which still exists, two panels only have been finished together with the interlaced patterns on the segments of the ring next to them. One of the subjects is the Crucifixion which has the sponge and spear bearers at either side and two angels above: the other, on the sinister arm, shows four figures standing side by side. See Plate VI. The remainder of the panels are either cut level with the general surface, or left as squares in relief; the former were probably intended to receive flat interlaced or other patterns and 8 The head of this cross was formerly loose, and many antiquaries have made the mistake of thinking that it belonged to the West Cross, and so illustrating it. LVI. O</page><page sequence="3">72 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND the latter deeply cut figure subjects or spiral designs with bosses. The decided way in which the flat and raised portions are distri buted shows that the sculptor had in his mind a clear scheme of decoration. This cross is of particular interest owing to its unfinished condition, which suggests that monuments of this class were, sometimes at least, set up uncarved and decorated at leisure. In this case the sculptor began with the upper part and would no doubt have left the base to the last, thus accounting for the fact that many crosses, otherwise fully carved, have plain bases. Of the West Cross, the only surviving portions are the base and shaft which together stand 12 feet 6 inches high. The base is rectangular and tapering, with a roll and bead along the angles; the panels thus enclosed are plain and look as if left ready for carving. The shaft is entirely covered with the designs given below. See Plate VII. On the east side from the base up:? 1. The Baptism of Christ. This is worth comparing with the same scene on Killary Cross, the treatment being much the same; the two sources of the Jordan are shown and the Baptist pours the water from a ladle As this panel is longer than that at Killary, two persons are shown standing on the bank; the Dove is also represented. The streams of the river are not, as at Killary and Armagh, interlaced with the feet of the figures.9 2. A standing figure with four others kneeling before him, the last of whom has in front several small objects; four additional persons are seen above. This suggests the Magi, except that the Holy Child is not seen; it may perhaps represent one of the miracles. 3. Two persons seated on chairs and facing the same way: the second holds up an object which may be a child: there is a small animal below the chair. In front of the seated figures are two standing and facing them. 4. Four persons, one of whom stands or sits behind a table or framework which has in front six upright bars. The figure at each side seems to be giving him some object, while the fourth stands with his arm raised. This may probably represent the calling of St. Matthew, 5. Three figures standing and facing the spectator, at the sinister end a fourth in profile, and at the dexter two others crouching, one above, or behind the other, and shooting with bows. 6. A broken panel in the centre of which is an ass and rider; a man kneels in front and others stand behind. This subject may have been the Flight into Egypt, or more probably, in view of the kneeling figure, the Entry into Jerusalem. 9 See J. Romilly Allen, Early Christian Symbolism, p. 231.</page><page sequence="4">BHHiBiPili liflr I'llii P" f Mi Willn mn^ ^ i f? East Side. West Side. THE WEiST CROSS, KELLS, CO. MEATH.</page><page sequence="5">EARLY CROSSES OF EiAST AND WEST MEATH 73 On the west side:? 1. The Fall. This is represented in the usual way. Adam and Eve are placed facing the spectator, and the branches of the tree arch over and fall to the ground behind them. 2. Noah and the Ark. The Ark is shown as a high short vessel with four windows, in each of which is seen a head. There is no mast; the dove perches on the deck; as a head appears above the deck and feet below the keel, it appears that Noah is represented in the act of leaving the Ark on the further side.10 A similar representation occurs on the broken cross at Armagh. 3. At either end of this panel are two men, the inner pair are holding out long objects like spears over the heads of two small figures crouched side by side in the centre. This, by comparison with other representations, strongly suggests the Three Children in the Furnace; the third would be behind, and perhaps hardly noticeable owing to the worn condition of the stone. Compare panel No. 4 on the east side of the South Cross. 4. At either end four small figures kneeling on one knee, two above and two below. In the centre is an upright object towards which all the figures face : Mr. Romilly Allen has described it as a fish, but he does not explain the meaning.11 The object in question extends the full height of the panel, and in its present condition looks as much like a tree trunk as a fish. 5. This panel is almost destroyed, it seems to have contained a close interlaced pattern. On the north side are:? 1. Two repetitions of a design consisting of freely drawn ser pents treated spirally. There are serpent heads at the angles of the designs, and at either side of the human heads which occupy the centres. 2. A long panel of diagonal key pattern, the entire centre of which, shaped like a diamond, is modified into spiral coils worked in relief as small bosses. 3. Two repetitions of a zoomorphic design in which two animals have their necks and bodies crossed and interlaced with their limbs and other appendages. 4. Portion of a panel almost entirely defaced. On the south side are :? 1. An excellent spiral pattern having sixteen coils carved in relief; in the centre is a cross with spiral extremities formed by leaving a space in the design. Crosses shown in this way are rare in spiral patterns though common in interlaced work. 2. A closely interlaced design of circular knotwork, repeated twice laterally and three and a half times vertically. 3. A spiral pattern in bad condition. It is closely involved and has from twenty-seven to thirty coils. 10 Same p. 232. n Same ref. as No. 10.</page><page sequence="6">74 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND 4. A diagonal fret, the band being marked by a medial line; the centres of all the keys are rounded off into spirals. 5. A broken panel of eight serpents, interlaced, and having spiral tails. The tails of the four in the centre form a swastika. This shaft is the remnant of a fine monument, and it is a matter of regret that the head portion has not been found. The Baptism and the Ark are of interest for comparison with the same subjects as carved on the shaft at Killary; especially as they do not occur in other districts, with the exception of Armagh. The panels representing the Call of St. Matthew and the Entry into Jerusalem?if these suggestions are correct?present us with subjects not hitherto recognised on sculptured crosses. There is a cast of this shaft in the National Museum. Fig. 4.?Base of the North Cross, at Kells, Co. Meath. The North Cross is merely a small conical socket stone, circular in plan, which stands beside the detached church tower. It is about 16 inches in height and has in the upper surface a rectan gular socket 11^ inches by 6 inches and 6 inches in depth. The conical part is divided, by horizontal beads, into five bands; the central band being carved with a number of interlaced knots which follow each other round the stone. See Fig. 4. The South Cross is the most complete and highly carved of the Kells monuments; the ornament may even be thought too crowded. See Plate VIII. Its height is 11 feet, and it bears the inscription:? PAumcn eu cotumbe ctuix. The letters are incised on the upper part of the base at the east side, and may possibly have been added at a later date than that of the monument. The lettering however is of an early type.12 12 Christian Inscriptions, vol. ii, plate xxxvi.</page><page sequence="7">EARLY CROSSES OF BAST AJSTD WEST MEATH 75 On the east side are :? 1. Carved on the base a hunter or warrior with a circular shield shown in profile, and probably spme weapon now broken away. He is accompanied by several dogs and is following four animals; including a stag, a boar, and a large bird. The fourth animal is uncertain. This scene also appears on the base of the cross in the market place of Kells, and at Castledermot, County Kildare. 2. The lowest panel on the shaft is filled with circular knot work having nine knots arranged in three rows. 3. Adam and Eve with the serpent and appletree, and beside them Cain striking Abel with a long curved weapon; subjects which are found on many crosses. In the corresponding design at Monasterboice the weapon is a cleaver1 or hatchet. 4. The Three'Children in the furnace, with an angel above and at either side a man raising a fagot on a fork. 5. A man standing between two animals, with a hand on the head of each. This is probably Daniel, though the manner of representation is unusual. 6. The centre, occupied by a circular spiral pattern of seven bosses symmetrically placed and surrounded by a border of close interlaced work. 7. Above the last are two fishes crossed in saltire. 8. The highest panel contains a number of figures (apparently seventeen) crowded together. The lowest pair are seen complete, they are seated facing each other, and hold indistinct objects in their hands. Of the other figures the hands and shoulders only are shown. Mr. Romilly Allen described this as David playing the harp.13 9. On the dexter arm is the Sacrifice of Isaac, represented in much the same way as on the Cross of Durrow: that is Abraham stands erect) with a sword while Isaac stoops over a small altar and the ram is shown above, that is in the background. 10. On the sinister arm is the well-known scene of the hermits Paul and Anthony dividing in the desert the bread brought to them by a raven. Between these figures and the centre is a winged animal like a griffon; inserted perhaps as being an inhabi tant of the desert. 11,12,13, 14. The segments of the ring are decorated with close interlaced patterns which differ from each other. The cap of this cross is lost. On the west side :? 1. The base shows a kind of procession, two horsemen and a dog are followed by two persons in a chariot. The same subject is found on other crosses; for instance on those at Clonmacnois, at Monasterboice, and at Ahenny, County Tipperary. 13 Presumably David and his choir. Early Christian Symbolism, p. 228.</page><page sequence="8">76 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND 2. Across the lower part of the shaft is a narrow border of diagonal key-pattern, and above it:? 3. A square panel of four men whose limbs and hair are elaborately interlaced; this design is repeated twice (to fill a long panel) on the cross of Muiredach at Monasterboice. 4. The Crucifixion, no cross is shown, but the angles of the panel are filled, below by the sponge and spear bearers, and above by two men seated instead of the angels seen in other examples. Over the head ofi Christ is a bird, most likely a phoenix as emblem of the resurrection. On this cross the Crucifixion does not occupy its usual place in the centre of the side opposite to the Judgment or Glory, but is placed on the shaft under the latter. 5. At the intersection is placed the figure of Christ in Glory, he holds, as in other representations, a cross and a flowering sceptire. At either side is a winged animal, and above appears the bust of a man whose uplifted arms seem to support a circular plaque on which is carved a Lamb. This lamb is represented naturally, without the cross and banner added in later work. 6. The top arm is covered with an effective spiral pattern having the centres of the coils, twelve in number, kept in relief as bosses. 7. 8. The designs on the arms are spirals of a similar type to the last, but having central bosses of a larger size. 9, 10, 11, 12. The segments of the ring show close interlaced work like that on the opposite face. On the north side:? 1. The base is covered with an interlaced pattern consisting of figure-of-eight knots arranged in three rows. 2. On the shaft is a small panel of diagonal fret pattern. 3. A long panel of circular knotwork, the bands of which ter minate in the heads and tails of animals. 4. A long panel showing the symbolic vine with squirrels scattered amongst the branches. This motive is also seen at Clonmacnois, Monasterboice, and other places.14 5. The under side of the ring bears a design of two animals, crossed diagonally, and having spirally coiled tails. 6. The under side of the arm has two serpents with interlaced tails, placed face to face. 7. The end of the arm shows a scene which appears to repre sent Samson killing the lion. 8. The upper side of the ring is covered with defaced inter lacing. 9. On the top arm two men stand side by side with a small animal above each of them. 14 See note in the Journal, B.8.A.I., vol. xlvi (1916), p. 181.</page><page sequence="9">r* ^v;'^^5&lt;jL .**: Hil^^^^^^^^'ff'' ,\_m_r5____i t?

West Side. THE SOUTH CROSS, KELLS, CO. MEATH.</page><page sequence="10">EARLY OROSSEB OF EAST AND WEST MEATH 77 On the south side:? 1. The base carries an interlaced pattern of two bands dis posed in looped knot work. 2. On the shaft a long panel ending above in two birds face to face, and below in a similar pair reversed in position. The central portion of the design is formed by elongating the tails of these birds, and weaving them into a ten strand plait. 3. Two animals facing each other with necks crossed and tails interlaced. 4. On the under side of the ring is a panel of defaced zoomor phic interlacing. 5. The under side of the arm has two animals side by side, each bent like the letter L. 6. The scene on the arm end is clearly David saving the lamb from the lion. It corresponds with Samson and the lion on the other arm. 7. The upper side of the ring shows some remains of an inter laced pattern. 8. The top arm bears the figures of two animals, perhaps a lion attacking a lamb. There isf a cast of this cross in the National Museum. The Cross now standing in the Market Place of Kells bears considerable resemblance to the South Cross just described; several of the designs being identical. It is a larger monument and has a greater number of figures carved on it; the loss of the top arm has reduced its height to 11 feet. A modern inscrip tion on the west side records its re-erection in 1688:15 originally, no doubt, it stood near the other crosses. See Plate IX. The subjects on the east side are :? 1. On the base a procession of four horsemen armed with swords and circular shields. (A). Plate X. 2. The lowest design on? the shaft is a small spiral or trumpet pattern of the earlier type which has no projecting bosses. 3. The next panel shows the soldiers guarding the tomb of Christ; the ground is represented in section and the body can be seen under it. This scene is carved in the same manner on crosses at Clonmacnois and Durrow Abbey. 4. This panel contains a large figure with club and shield stand ing in the midst of twelve smaller ones also with circular shields. 5. A panel showing two scenes; the first Adam and Eve with the serpent and appletree; the second Cain killing Abel. The latter has sometimes been explained as the Expulsion from Eden, but on this cross as well as on others, one figure seems to be actually striking the other on the head. 15 This inscription is given in the Journal, B.S.A.I., vol. xxii (1892), p. 120.</page><page sequence="11">78 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND 6. In the centre or intersection of the cross is a standing figure with outstretched hands, surrounded by four animals. This may be Daniel, though he should properly be shown with seven lions as on the cross at Moone Abbey. There are two small figures above and two below. 7. On the dexter arm is shown the Sacrifice of Isaac; he stoops over the altar and holds in his hand the axe with which the wood has been cut, Abraham stands near armed with a sword. 8. The sinister arm has the constantly repeated device of a man standing between two animals or animal-headed figures. In this case the heads seem to be those of a cock and a goat, as on the crosses at Moone Abbey and Castledermot. 9. 10, 11, 12. The segments of the ring are covered with closely interlaced knotwork. On the west side:? 1. The base shows a man and dog driving animals. The latter are more numerous than in the corresponding scene on the South Cross; but a stag, a boar, and a large bird are included in eaeh. (B). Plate X. 2. The first panel on the shaft has been cut away to receive the inscription already referred to. 3. The design is partly defaced; it seems to show a figure holding a child, and several others bowing down. This should be the Adoration of the Magi. 4. Four small figures kneeling and holding books; above them three larger figures, the central one kneeling and holding out hands towards the person at the dexter side: above is the Dextera Dei. This may represent one of the miracles of Christ. 5. A man seated between two partially defaced figures which do not seem to be human; the sinister one has feet like a bird. 6. In the centre is the Crucifixion with sponge and spear bearers: at either side a detached human head and a small figure bent down. 7. On the dexter arm two ecclesiastics standing with a small figure near them. One of them wears a ring brooch and touches the small figure with the end of a T-headed staff. 8. The sinister arm has also on it two ecclesiastics standing, one of whom touches, with a crook-headed staff or crosier, a small figure placed upside down near them. It will be remembered that on the north cross at Duleek, already described, there are figures bearing the same two forms of&gt;crosier, and touching human heads placed near them. The Duleek cross is a small monument and probably did not afford space for more than the heads. 9. 10, 11, 12. The segments of the ring are ornamented with closely interlaced zoomorphic patterns.</page><page sequence="12">East Side. West Side. THE MARKET CROSS, KELLS, CO'. MEATH.</page><page sequence="13">EARLY CROSSES OF EAST AND WEST MEATH 79 On the north side:? 1. The design on the base is apparently symbolic; at the dexter end are two eagles, face to face, one holding a lamb and the other a fish. At the other end are two centaurs following each other, the first carrying a branch, the second shooting with a bow. A small animal is placed above the first centaur while a bird perches on the back of the second. (C). Plate X. 2. The lowest panel on the shaft represents two men in the act of wrestling. Figs. 5 and 6.?From the Market Cross, Kells, Co. Meath. 3. The next is greatly injured, but seems to be a similar subject. 4. Three men standing side by side with legs and arms inter laced. 5. An anthropomorphic figure with horns, hooves, and tail, as well as a long plaited beard. At either side is a rampant wolf like animal biting the ear of the central figure. See Fig. 5. This is of course a variety of the subject seen in No. 8 on the east side. 6. The under side of the ring is divided into three narrow vertical panels. The central one contains a diagonal key pattern, and each of the others two men with heads at opposite ends and legs hooked together in the middle. 7. The under side of the arm is occupied by a rectangular panel in which are four men arranged round the sides in the same</page><page sequence="14">80 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND direction. Each grasps the foot of the next, and, two of them have legs hooked together in the centre. 8. On the end of the arm two ecclesiastics stand side by side and hold crosiers. Between them a bird flies downwards hold ing in its beak a circular object. This occurs on many monu ments and represents the hermits Paul and Anthony dividing the bread brought to them by a raven. They are identified by the inscription on the cross at Ruthwell in Dumfrieshire which names them. * * * * * * * ' Fig 7.?Kells Market Cross.?Design on the Under Side of the Ring. (1/5). 9.

A hunting scene in which a man is spearing a stag while a hound springs on its back. 3. Two men standing with a third in a reversed position between them, one is striking the latter with a sword. 4. A broken panel showing one person kneeling before another who wears a brooch or clasp marked with a cross. A small animal and a bird are placed above the head of the kneeling figure. 5. A man standing and holding out an L-shaped object which is touched by a large hand projecting downwards from the top of the panel. The hand has the thumb and two fingers extended and must represent the Dextera Dei. The scene is almost cer tainly intended for Moses receiving the tables of the law; it is not known on any other monument. See Fig. 6. 6. On the under side of the ring the three narrow panels corres pond to those on the north side. The middle one.' has the same diagonal fret pattern, and the others have each four men with heads in pairs at the ends, the legs being worked into a six-cord plait in the centre. See Fig. 7. 7. The panel on the under side of the arm shows two large bosses covered with combined fret and spiral pattern, and wreathed round with four serpents. 8. On the end of the arm is carved the scene of David delivering the lamb from the lion. 9. The design on the upper side of the ring is worn away from exposure, but must have resembled No. 6. The unique panels No. 5 north and No. 5 south are illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. There is a cast of this cross in the National Museum.</page></plain_text>
