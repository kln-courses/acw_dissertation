And finally, we have no evidence that the Sadducees considered the Pentateuch to be the only revealed word of God (see Contra Apionem, I, 37-42). A Sadducee could hardly have made sense of Philo's allegories and midrashic comments. Prof. Goodenough has also some very illuminating discussions of the mystic philosophy in non-Philonic sources (pp. 265-358). His analysis in chapter 11 of the possibility that there may be a mystic Jewish source for the liturgy of the Apostolic Constitution is very convincing. The discussion of the mystery in the Kabbalah is, however, based on secondary material and is not as informative as the rest of the book. In conclusion, we may say that Prof. Goodenough's book as a whole reveals the author's mastery of the field of Hellenistic and Greek literature and his extensive knowledge is blended with an unusual power of critical analysis. The contribution of the book is manifold. First, it gives a systematic and profound understanding of Philo's allegories, and henceforth it will be impossible for any serious student to study Philo without detailed consideration of the author's investi- gation. Second, New Testament scholars will now be able to determine with greater accuracy how much early Christianity was influenced by Philo's mystic philosophy. Whether Philo's mystic philosophy depends on a prior Jewish mystic cult can not be decided until more positive evidence is available. It is to be hoped that Prof. Goodenough will discuss the matter in the subsequent volumes which he has promised. OESTERLEY'S GOSPEL PARABLES2 THIS book consists of a series of lectures on the forms and applica- tions of the Gospel Parables. The author believes that one of the reasons why there is such a great diversity of opinions concerning the central truth and doctrinal significance of the Gospel Parables is the fact that scholars have often neglected to study the parables from the point of view of their Jewish environment. The author, therefore, analyzes the parables in the light of the conditions, customs and traditions which 2 The Gospel Parables in the Light of their Jewish Background. By W. O. E. OESTERLEY.

The book as a whole does not add much to our information since most of the Jewish sources which appear in the book have been quoted by previous writers, a fact which the author acknowledges. The book, however, adds to our understanding of the Gospels since the writer uses good judgment in selecting the best rabbinic material from the works of Bacher, Abrahams, Montefiore and others. Dr. Oesterley is entirely objective in his discussion of the Pharisees and the doctrines of the Rabbis and makes an entirely undogmatic approach to the subject as a whole. S.
