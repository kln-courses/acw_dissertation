<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXXV, Fasc. 1 THE SALUTARY DESCENT A. SYRKIN 1. The theme "rise and descent", together with another closely related dichotomy, "upper part"-"lower part", appears to be one of the most meaningful topics in the broad domain of cultural, anthropological and, particularly, religious studies. One can men- tion but a few equally important opposites that as directly reflect the most essential traits of our experience and, at the same time, per- tain to the cardinal structural and semantic qualities of religious dogmatics, myth, ritual procedure, etc.' The many direct or indirect use of corresponding notions encompasses various spheres of human activity, each with different functions and evaluations concerning their surroundings.2 This dichotomy naturally refers first of all to spatial relations, appearing as a common modelling universal in different cosmologies. The examples are too numerous to be cited. Let us consider only the well-known threefold vertical division of cosmos in Vedic tradition (cf. tridhatu in RV I, 154. 4 a.o.) into three worlds: heaven (dyaus), midspace (antariksa) and earth (prthvi).3 This division with occasional modification (heaven-earth- underworld) has been preserved throughout the millenia of Indian culture. The categories of "ascent"-"descent" (like those of "upper part"-"lower part") have from time immemorial transgressed the limits of the purely spatial, and have served in describing emotional and psychic (cf. e.g. Lat. "exsultare" derivatives) states and, con- sequently, ethic values. They have, thus, helped to model a kind of ethical continuum in which they describe a number of cardinal dichotomies-both directly (like those of "heaven-"earth"; "heaven"-'"underworld") and obliquely (resp. "day"-"night"; "light"-'"darkness; "pure"-"impure", etc.).4 Corresponding opposites as a rule receive positive or negative ethical evaluation, respectively, here, such as "elevated", "exalted" or "base", "low". Assuming this general usage, we shall try to note its</page><page sequence="2">2 A. Syrkin modifications resulting from certain dogmatic peculiarities (such as e.g. Hindu approach to "life"-"death" opposition). Regarding this model of ethical space one can speak of dogmatic, mythological, or ritualistic elements which serve here as organizing factors connected with vertical transference.5 These are, within the framework of Indian sources, the oppositions of "this world" (the earth) and "that world" (the sky) (BU I. 5.4: ayam lokah .... asau lokah), or of "the path of the gods" (devayana) and "the path of the fathers" (pitryana) (BU VI. 2.15-16; ChU IV. 15; V. 10; cf. KauU 1.2 sq.).6 The Buddhist model likewise suggests the opposi- tion of "this" and "that" world (lokiya-lokuttara) connected with the idea of corresponding transition, accomplished by a monk in the course of perfection.7 The function of the connecting link in this space can be fulfilled by a superhuman, yet anthropomorphic, being like purusa in Vedic cosmogony, Visnu (cf. below), etc.8 Among other organizing fac- tors the cosmic tree is perhaps the most widespread g-both in spatial and ethical regulation (cf. BU III, 9. 28; TU I, 10.1; KtU II, 3.1; SU III, 9; VI, 6; MtU VI, 4; Bg. XV, 1-3, etc.). The ritual text can also serve such a link-cf. the function of the sacred syllable "om" (aum) which leads the believer to highest perfection (PU, V, 2-5)10 when properly used in meditation. The same is said of other sacrifical formulas. As we know, this symbolism is variously reflected in iconographic tradition, with corresponding localization of individual symbols." Nevertheless, this regularity does not always appear to be immutable: as we have already mentioned, it now and then permits different interpretations of the same concept. So, within the frameworks of separate traditions, and staying in the same system of the ethical space, we come across different meanings and func- tions of the "descent" phenomenon. On the one hand such a "des- cent" (literal or metaphorical) corresponds with the general evalua- tion of the "upper"-"lower" dichotomy (as well as with other correlated opposites) mentioned above. It is not necessarily con- nected here with the idea of subsequent salvation or ascent, but is influenced, rather, by the sum of previous deeds and qualities of the descendant (one may say, by his karmic state) and by his inclina- tions which have nothing to do with the purpose of salvation. It</page><page sequence="3">The Salutary Descent 3 may even be opposed to it. With respect to godly descendants one can cite manifold anthropomorphic beliefs (e.g. as a result of pas- sion in ancient Greek mythology) or the fallen-rather than descended-semigods (asuras, fallen angels, etc.).12 The mortal variant is, e.g., returning (after temporary ascent, as in the evidence mentioned above, in note 6) to mother womb or to one of the lower worlds, with subsequent rebirth, which can be repeated many times. Other well-known beliefs speak of a single descent to Hades, hell, etc., the final salvation being possible as a result of cer- tain other activities and not of descent itself. We are dealing here with another type of descent-one that serves a necessary device for subsequent ascent, liberation and perfection. As such, it can appear in its independent positive value, sometimes even without any explicit reference to the goal. This salutary descent is also characteristic not only of god-like creatures (beginning with most archaic ideas of shamans' heavenly origin and ending with modern Messianic beliefs) but of mortals as well. It is connected with a large field of religious studies that go beyond the scope of the present paper. We shall restrict ourselves to a few aspects of this salutary descent-mainly those pertaining to ancient Indian sources. 2. The widespread motif of perfection preceded or accompanied by denigration, descent, etc. can be illustrated by semantic usage, e.g. that of "humility", "humble" (Lat. "humus")-so typical of a pious context.'3 This attitude appears as an imporant feature in the ancient Hindu institution of brahmacarin ("leading a chaste life") whereby the pupil lives in the house of his teacher.'4 He must respect the latter like a deity (the father giving him birth is not as important as the "father" who gives him the knowledge of Veda- Man II, 146). He must serve the teacher, tend his house, the sacred fires, the cattle; go begging for him when necessary. He sleeps on earth, washes his teacher's feet, always takes the lower seat, waits upon his relatives, and so on (Man II, 71 sq., 108, 130 sq., 198 etc.). According to Man II, 233, obedience to mother leads him to this world, obedience to father to midspace, while obedience to guru leads to heaven. He must avoid praise and strive for contempt (II, 162).</page><page sequence="4">4 A. Syrkin We can suggest that the student's state and the process of study itself are relfected in the corresponding texts. We refer to the genre of upanisads, the precepts that played a decisive role in Indian spiritual life. The etymology is fairly clear: a derivative from the verb upa-ni-sad- "to sit down at" (evidently, "at the feet of another to listen to his words").15 The notion of the genuine, mysterious, esoteric knowledge (cf. SU V, 6; VI, 22; BU VI, 3. 12; ChU III, 11.5; MuU iii, 2.11 etc.) thus developed from the original description of the posture of the pupil, listening to his teacher. Here one should consider the prefix upa- (Greek 6t6, Lat. sub, etc.), bearing the sense of approaching, being in a lower state and, conse- quently, approaching from beneath, a respectful approach, etc. Hence the notion of upasana (cf. ChU II, 1.1; KauU II, 7 etc.) from upa-as- "to sit near, at hand" (in order to honour or wait upon, to serve, to respect, etc.) denoting, evidently, the teachings of the upanisads and the act of genuinely understanding and wor- shipping them.16 Cf. also such notions as upapanna- "approached" as a pupil, for protection; upanayana-a ceremony of brahmana's initiation preceding his studies; etc. A particular example of approach for knowledge is presented in the text of Katha upanisad. During the sacrifice Vajasravasa (called in KtU I, 1.10-11 also Gautama and Auddalaki, the son of Aruna-cf. below) gets angry with his son Naciketas, who doubted the efficiency of traditional rite, and swears to give him to Death. Naciketas (cf. possible interpretation of his name: "I do not know") understands him verbally and goes to the abode of Yama, god of death. He stands there for three nights waiting for Yama's return (Taittiriya brahmana III, 11.8) and the god being pleased permits him to make three wishes. First, the youth chooses to allay his father's anger. Then he asks to recieve knowledge of the celestial fire that leads to heaven (cf. ChU VI, 8.4 and corresponding allegories-see above, note 6).17 Finally, he wishes to know the fate of man after death. The plot of Katha, noteworthy in particular for its dramatic initial point (father's wrath and son's obedience that lead to highest perfection), can be compared with the traditional genre of peregrinatio-a pilgrimage in quest of truth. The func- tions of Yama-god of death, ruling over spirits of the deceased, king of the South-evidently correspond to some of the notions dis-</page><page sequence="5">The Salutary Descent 5 cussed here and enable one to speak of descent, followed by suc- cessful ascent of the illuminated hero (cf. Yama's words to Naciketas "released from the jaws of death"-KtU I, 1. 11).18 At the same time certain details-three night's waiting; a chain (srfikam) given by the god to youth (KtU I, 1.16); etc.-suggest a peculiar initiatory rite, reflected in the text.'9 The Upanishadic evidence also presents other images of pupils acting in less dramatic circumstances, though not less patient and self-denying. Satyakama Jabala, son of a maid-servant and unknown father, serves Haridrumata Gautama (ChU IV, 4 sq.) waiting for instruction. The teacher gives him four hundred thin, weak cows and he tends them for years till they number a thousand. Then he receives the right knowledge from a bull, the fire, a swan and a diving-bird, yet, though enlightened, he asks the teacher for instruction. Afterwards, himself a teacher, he behaves still more strictly towards his pupil, Upakosala Kamalayana, who tends his fires for twelve years (ibid. IV, 10 sq.). Satyakama neither instructs him nor allows him to depart (like other pupils) notwithstanding his own wife's arguments. "Then on account of sickness (grief), he resolved not to eat. The teacher's wife said to him: "O student of sacred wisdom, please eat. Why, pray, do you not eat?" Then he said: "Many are the desires in this person, which proceed in dif- ferent directions. I am filled with sicknesses (griefs). I will not eat" (ChU IV, 10. 3).20 Thereupon, the sacrificial fires pity him and give him instruction (particularly about the ascent to Brahman- ChU, IV, 15.5; cf. above, note 6). Divine creatures are subject to this trial as well. The god Indra and asura Virocana live thirty-two years with the teacher of gods, Prajapati (ChU VIII, 7 sq.), who first gives an incomplete explana- tion of Atman, in order to test them. Virocana believes it and departs, thinking he has found the truth; but in fact he has acquired a disastrous doctrine close to hedonism. Thus, the thirty-two years of study do not help him (cf. MtU VII, 10, where Brahman deliberately cheats the asuras who desire to known Atman). Unlike Virocana, Indra remains unsatisfied, returns to Prajaipati, receives another incomplete admonition and so on, till at last after 101 years of study he receives genuine knowledge.</page><page sequence="6">6 A. Syrkin This humiliation is not only typical of pupils. Kavasa Ailuiisa is not allowed by brahmainas to participate in the sacrifice, but, though rejected as a son of a maid-servant, he later shows them the way to knowledge. Usasti Cakrayana, who has evidently accomplished his studies, lives in great poverty in a destroyed village and begs for food. Later, however, he becomes a priest and admonishes his less competent fellow-workers (ChU I, 10-11). A king, Brihadratha, leaves the kingdom to his son and goes into the forest to practice austerity for several years. Then he asks the sage Sakayanya for instruction, denouncing in a characteristic manner (cf. below, note 67) the mortal body and speaking of his sorrow ("Be pleased, therefore, to deliver me. In this world (cycle of existence) I am like a frog in a waterless well"-MyU I, 4).21 The Upanishadic believer, though not necessarily suffering in his quest for truth, is always full of self-denial, humility and devotion to his teacher. "Not by work, nor by offspring or wealth; only by renunciation (tyagena) does one reach life eternal" (Kaivalya upanisad, 2; cf. ibid. 5).22 The pupil's trial, often connected with humiliation and suffering, seems to be natural enough with respect to the goal-the attain- ment of highest perfection beyond all worldly attachments. More surprising here is the following evidence, regarding the teacher's image; his behaviour occasionally exceeds the accepted norms of strictness and approaches cruelty. An evident heartlessness is displayed by Satyakama Jabala, who drives his pupil almost to suicide. In the same chapter (ChU IV 1-2) we read about the learned Raikva who is sought by Janasruti Pautrayana. The latter finds Raikva under a cart, whereupon the sage looking rather miserable, displays attitudes of coarseness, avidity and lasciviousness. He calles Janasruti (a ksatriya) a gfidra, refuses to accept his liberal gift-a payment for learning (six hundred cows, a gold necklace and a chariot with mules) and agrees only when Janasruti presents him with a thousand cows etc. together with his own daughter and the village where he lived. Lifting up the girl's face and evidently contented with it, Raikva comments: "Sfidra, merely by this face you would make me speak" (IV, 2. 5)-the words are plain enough, though softened in later allegorical inter- pretations.23 One can say that the Upanishadic evidence somehow</page><page sequence="7">The Salutary Descent 7 "lowers" the image of the preceptor: in a certain correspondence with the pupil's humiliation, we come across arrogance and cruelty on the part of the teacher, in other words, a certain degradation (this time a moral one). Here we shall touch upon a peculiar and rather unexpected trait in exposing the admonition. The precepts of Y ajfiavalkya (a famous Upanishadic sage who preaches the essence of the doctrine) about Atman are followed in BU III, 9.26 (cf. SB XI, 6.3.11) by a curse on his opponent Sakalya, guilty of ignorance. He threatens that Sakalya's head will fall off (mfirdha to vipatisyati) if he does not answer his question.24 It is not a bluff; Sakalaya is unable to answer, his head falls off and robbers take away his bones. In SB XI, 6.3.11, Yajfiavalkya predicts that Sakalya will die in an inauspicious place and time, and that even his bones shall not be brought home. Thus it happens. Samkara's commentary explains that Sakalya was punished for not having respected the knower of Brahman, yet the punishment still appears to be too cruel. Another threat is addressed to Gargi Vacaknavi. Ya-jfiavalkya warns the woman to be moderate in questioning: "Gargi, do not question too much lest your head fall off. Verily, you are questioning too much about a divinity about which we are not to ask too much" (III, 6.1).25 This time Gargi's curiosity is the crime. She, however, keeps silent and remains alive. The same curse is used against Yajfiavalkya himself. Uddalaka Aruini (another great sage; cf., in particular, his tat tvam asi, "that art thou"-in ChU VI, 8. 7 sq.) threatens him in the same manner, but Ya-jfiavalkya knows the right answer (BU III, 7.1 sq.). In ChU, Silaka Salavatya (I, 8.6) and Pravahana Jaivali (I, 8.8) again use it in a talk. Later, Usasti Cakrayana, mentioned above, uses it (I, 10. 9-11; 11. 4-9) while warning the priests not to recite corresponding texts without knowledge. Speaking to six brahmanas, accepted by him as pupils, AMvapati Kaikeya threatens each one with the loss of their heads, blindness, loss of breath, etc., had they not come to him for instruc- tion (V, 12.2; 13.2; etc.). His curses are motivated by insufficient definitions which these brahmanas give to Atman. One could sug- gest that tribute is paid here to a traditional proberb (cf. also SB XI, 4.1.9; 5.3.13, etc.) which was evidently widespread (some parallels from Buddhist evidence will be adduced below). Yet the end of</page><page sequence="8">8 A. Syrkin Sakalya renders this usage somewhat less harmless. We can possibly speak of a certain aggressiveness of teachers which reveals (together with their obviously benefactory function in preaching the highest Truth) a character of definite ambivalence to their image.26 It has already been remarked that a tendency to frighten or humiliate the listener appears at first to be somewhat incompatible with preaching the wisdom that leads a believer to perfection and bliss. Nevertheless, these "incompatibilities" do not seem to be accidental, and we shall return to similar cases below. 3. We spoke above mostly of mortals-pupils and preceptors, whose behaviour can be characterized by a definite descent, metaphorical or verbal, in search of the Truth or in proclaiming it. Let us consider now examples of divine descent, the descent of those already possessing the highest perfection. The cosmological principle places the world of gods above the world of mortals and the idea of divine descent--whatever its function is and whatever attitude it stimulates-naturally presupposes spatial descent in the original meaning of the word. Ancient Indian evidence contains much data regarding the interference of gods in human life. Hymns of RV speak of Indra's wandering on earth in different forms (I, 55. 4; VI, 155.4; etc.); similar manifestations of Brahman, Varu.na, Prajapati, Rudra, etc. are depicted in vedas and brahmainas.27 We shall touch here upon certain aspects of Visnu's descents, which, compared with those of other gods, have been more thoroughly described and have influ- enced to a greater extent Indian spiritual life. The image of Visnu appears entirely different in different epochs in separate trends of Hinduism-his functions, his place in Hindu pantheon, and relation to other deities suffer considerable changes.28 In Vedic times he plays rather a secondary role, yielding to Indra, Soma, Agni, etc. However, in Vedic evidence we already find some characteristic traits of his image that were developed in later Hinduism. First of all, it is his ability to pervade all worlds (cf. a traditional etymology of his name; via--"to enter", "to penetrate").29 Another idea connected with his image is a quick transference in space (RV. I, 90.5; II, 34. 11; etc.)-cf. his epithets urugaya ("wide going"), urukrama ("wide striding"), etc.30 This quality is displayed in a well-known motif of Visnu's three strides,</page><page sequence="9">The Salutary Descent 9 widely represented in later epic tradition (cf. above, note 8). Here, his first two steps are connected with earth and midspace, accessible to a mortal's perception, while the third is connected with the heavenly world (RV, I, 22.18-21; 90.9; 154. 1.5; 155, 4-5; VI 49.13; VIII, 29.7; etc.). This transference was identified by ancient commentators with the sun's path through the three worlds (another interpreation connects it with the sun's position in the East, the Zenith and the West). At the same time, Visnu appears in RV as a benefactor and preserver: generous (I, 156. 2 sq.), giving protection (III, 55.10), helping to aryas (I, 156.6), etc. He defeats demons (Vrtra, Vasa, a.o.)-like Indra with whom he sometimes appears as an ally. Another characteristic quality is his manifestation in different forms (RV III, 55. 10; VII, 100. 6; etc.), in particular, his epithet sipivista ("the smallest") in RV VII, 100.5 is connected perhaps with the image of a dwarf (cf. SB I, 2.5.5; V, 2.5.4. etc.; see below).3' These traits which were developed later in brahmainas (Satapatha, Taittiriya) gradually draw his image nearer to that of epic Visnu, so, e.g., here we find versions of his outwitting asuras in a dwarf's disguise (SB I, 2. 5. 5. so; TB I, 6. 1-5). There are also other motifs of Visnu's incarnations, developed from brahmanas' evidence (as SB I, 8. 1. 1 sq.; XIV, 1.2. 1; etc.). An important process in the development of Vishnuism is the fusion (approximately from the middle of the 1st millenium B.C.) of Visnu with other deities and heroes, which evidently lose their position as independent objects of veneration and are regarded as Visnu himself or his manifestations. Likewise, his fusions with Narayana, Brahman, Krsna. Of these, Narayana, who appears in brahmainas, was esteemed as the primordial cosmic man (purusa), the author of the corresponding Vedic hymn (RV X, 90). He was also traditionally connected with some of the upanisads. Another name of Visnu-Vasudeva ("benefactory god")-refers to a deity identified in later Vedic texts with Visnu and Narayana, and regarded as a manifestation of the highest spirit.32 Various manifestations of Visnu often play quite an independent role and appear at very different levels-from the highest transcen- dant Being (Bhagavan, Narayana) to a mortal endowed with human qualities. This complexity is already reflected in epos, cf. a</page><page sequence="10">10 A. Syrkin list of his names in Mbh VI, 65. 61, or another more elaborate, through relatively later, list of a thousand names in Mbh XIII, 149. We are interested here primarily in a traditional set of manifesta- tions, marking the descent of Visnu. It is noteworthy that these deeds received a name containing the same notion: avatara (ava-tr, "to descend").33 This term, though applied to decent in general (and particularly to the descent of a god), acquired a special designation for descents and manifestations of Visnu (although not of him alone).34 A number of his avataras appear in Mbh (cf. III, 102. 21 sq.; XII, 341. 104 sq.; etc.)-a corresponding theory is completed in later epics (puranas) which are fully or partly dedicated to him (Visnu, Narada, Bhagavata, Garuda, Padma, Varaha, etc.) These texts were compiled mostly in the second half of the 1st millenium A.D. and later.35 Here the number of avataras generally exceeds that of Mbh and varies in different sources, some- times even within the frames of the same text, as, e.g., 16, 22, or 23 in BP I, 3; II, 7; XI, 4; cf. also Vayu purania 97. 72 sq.; 98. 63; etc. One of the fullest variants is found in a paficaratrin text Ahirbudhnya samhita 5.50-57 (39 avataras).36 At the same time we find in separate puranic texts (Varaha purana, 15. 9 sq., MP, 285. 67; etc.) the lists of ten avataras-a number that becomes canonical and from ca. XI century is found also in non-puranic Vishnuite poetry; in Ksemendra's (XI c.) Daiavataracarita, a poem especially dedicated to ten avataras37; in Jayadeva's (the 2nd half of XII c.) Gitagovinda (I, 5 sq.); etc. They are: fish, tortoise, boar, man-lion, dwarf, Parasurama, Rama, Krsna, Buddha and Kalki. Among other avataras, important in Hinduism, one can mention Narayana (see above); Sanatkumara (an embodiment of eternal youth); sages like Narada, Kapila; Yajfia (an embodiment of sacrifice); Vyasa (the legendary author of Mbh and other epics), etc. However, the list of the ten incarna- tions, mentioned above, became the most popular. When the time of deluge approaches Visinu appears in the form of a fish (matsya) before Manu, the legendary forefather of mankind, averts him from the cataclysm and shows him the way to salvation. As a result, Manu and his family, the great sages and Vedas are saved. The next apparition is connected with the conse- quence of the deluge that had swallowed the god's drink of immor-</page><page sequence="11">The Salutary Descent 11 tality (amrta). In the form of a tortoise (kiirma) Visnu sinks to the bottom of the ocean and becomes a support for the mountain Man- dara, used by gods for churning the ocean, so that in the end amrta and other treasures appear on the surface (among them Laksmi, goddess of luck and beauty, who became Visnu's consort). Some time after it, the earth is again submerged in the ocean by a demon Hiranyaksa. Visnu assumes the form of a boar (varaha), kills the demon, descends to the underworld and raises the earth on his tusk from out of the ocean.38 This exploit already marks Visnu's suc- cessful struggle against demons (asura) that take hold over the world, frighten gods and men, act lawlessly, etc. This struggle is characteristic of some of the following avataras. Assuming the form of "man-liion" (narasimha), a creature never seen before, Visnu tears to pieces the mighty invulnerable demon Hirainyakadipu who oppressed all pious creatures.39 Afterwards another demon, Bali, takes hold of the three worlds, threatening the gods. Visnu appears before him looking like a dwarf (vamana), asks to present him three paces of land and then becomes a giant, whereby he measures the three worlds, leaving for Bali the underworld (cf. above, note 8).40 In the next avatara (Parasurama) Visnu appears as a mighty brahmaina and kills a wicked king, Kartavirya, together with numerous warriors that oppressed brahmanas. The next is the image of Rama, princee of Ayodhya, who saved the world from the demon Ravaina (it is possible that a fusion with the historical king ruling in VIII-VII cc. B.C. took place). This avatara is widely reflected in literary tradition (first of all-in Ramayana epic). Then follows an avatara which is, perhaps, even more famous in Indian culture-that of Krsna. The latter often appears as an independent deity, his image being fused with that of Narayana, Bhagavant, etc. Krsna is born in the ksatriya family, Yadu; his parents are persecuted by his uncle, the demon Kamsa, who received a pro- phecy that his nephew would kill him. The boy, born with black (krsna) skin, grows up in the shepherd's house. His youth abounds with stories of childish tricks and amorous adventures with cowherdesses. Later exploits of Krsna include victories over many demons, help to shepherds, successful rivalry with gods (Brahman, Varuna, etc.). Her appears as a friend and protector of pa ndavas in Mbh-it is from him that Arjuna learns the great admonition of</page><page sequence="12">12 A. Syrkin Bhagavadgita.41 Krsna is, however, traditionally esteemed as the god connected with pastoral thematics, supervising over herds (cf. his epithets; gopati, govinda, etc.; see e.g., BP X; Visnu purana V, 6. sq.; Agni puraina, 12 sq.; etc.) and as the conqueror of demons. This complicated image of shepherd-warrior-preceptor corresponding to a certain degree to the manifold character of Visnu himself, is possibly derived from different prorotypes, mythical or historical, fused to a single avatara.42 The next Visnu's descent as Buddha (though with considerable alterations in the lat- ter's image) presents evidence of mutual interaction between dif- ferent religious trends in India. Some aspects of Buddha's salutary function will be noted below; here we should merely remark that the reception of Buddha in Vishnuite dogmatics as one of Visnu's avataras,43 agrees with the well-known phenomenon of Buddhism's accommodation to different (particularly non-Indian) cultural traditions. On the other hand, Buddhist dogmatics accept (though with substantional hierarchical modifications) the Hindu pantheon. Here Hindu gods are subject to the laws proclaimed by Buddha whom they worship and whose admonitions they are seeking.4 The tenth and last avatara is that of Kalki-the future image of Visnu. In the end of the present kaliyuga (which began on the 18 II 3102 B.C. and lasts 432000 years) he will appear riding on a white horse, will punish evil, reward piety and, destroying the world sunk deep in vice, will re-establish the new golden age. This messianic appari- tion evoked many well-known parallels.45 The complex of the ten avataras displays certain interesting semantic regularities.46 First of all they are united by one main function: saving the world from evil, defence of the oppressed, for whose sake Visnu from time to time assumes different forms and descents. He himself refers to it in the image of Krsna (Bg IV, 7-8): "For whenever of the right a languishing appears .... a rising up of unright, then I send myself forth. For protection of the good and for destruction of evil-doers, to make a firm footing for the right, I come into being in age after age.""47 (See also Mbh III, 272. 51; cf. XII, 341. 102 sq.; etc.). His descents are thus aimed at protec- ting and strengthening the dharma. Their chronological order is distributed within the framework of the four world periods (yuga) of Indian cosmology. In the first, the "golden" period (krtayuga),</page><page sequence="13">The Salutary Descent 13 he appears in the first four avataras: fish, tortoise, boar (cf. note 38) and man-lion; in the second, the "silver" age (tretayuga), in the next three: dwarf, Parasurama, Rama; in the third, the "copper" age (dvaparayuga), as Krsna; and in the last, the "iron" age (kaliyuga), as Buddha and the future Kalki.48 There is another regulairty here-the progressive evolution of Visnu's forms: as we see, his first three avataras are theriomorphic, the fourth is mixed (man-lion), while the next are anthropomorphic.49 Within the framework of this devlopment one can trace further traits of "phylogenetic" progress from aquatic to amphibious and mam- mals, while the human image also develops from a dwarf to the per- fect form of a Buddha (cf. traditional description of the latter's body). It is interesting that besides this physical perfection an ethical one can be found in corresponding avataras (though not always to the same degree). While Visnu's earlier descents are stimulated mostly by cosmic disasters, gods' (or especially brahmanas') troubles and the demons' arrogance, his subsequent apparitions are more and more characterized by preaching, which gradually replaces his violent attributes. This tendency culminates in the image of Buddha (while the last avatara of Kalki, as already noted, again combines benevolence and violence). As we see, the salutary function presupposes salvation in the broad sense of the word: physical help in danger and calamity, on the one hand, and spiritual help in delusion, on the other. These are the abilities com- bined in the image of Krsna, though usually they are distributed between different avataras.50 These exploits do not, however, exclude certain ambivalent traits characteristic of Visnu's image. His function of preservation and defence is accompanied by destruction and murder (e.g., in his apparitions as man-lion, Parasurama, Kalki).51 A number of his epithets connected with this function reflect notions of enmity, slaughter, etc. (names referring to victories over asuras, such as Kamsari-" enemey of Kamsa", Madhuripu--"enemy of Madhu", Madhusudana-"killer of Madhu" etc.). Such epithets, often used in Krishnaite lyrical tradition, sometimes lead to peculiar oxymoron-like combinations (cf. e.g., the title of the IV canto of Gitagovinda: snigdhamadhusudana- '"the affectionate killer of Madhu").52 Of all Visnu's avatiras this one (Krsna) is,</page><page sequence="14">14 A. Syrkin perhaps, most marked by human weakness and vice 53-traits perti- nent to different aspects of his activity. The epic evidence of Mbh, Harivamgra, purfanas refer to his tendency to fraud (cf. his advice to pindavas in Mbh); while living among shepherds he steals, devastates gardens, seduces shepherd's wives. He is humanized in his lyrical type: his amorous states displaying grief, languor, repen- tance, subjugation, etc.54 (to be continued) The Hebrew University of A. SYRKIN Jerusalem Concerning the role of this opposition in different traditions, cf. e.g.: L. Beir- naert, "Le symbolisme ascensionnel dans la liturgie et la mystique chr&amp;- tiennes"-EJ, 1950, Bd.

Aufstieg und Abstieg. Rise and Descent. Descente et Ascension (articles by U. Mann, D. L. Miller, D. I. Lauf, a.o.). 2 Such, for example, is the possibility of different evaluations of the same notion within the framework of common sense, on the one hand, and the non-pragmatic, idealistic approach on the other: cf. positive sense of "basic", "earthly" and negative of "soaring over", in the first case, and reverse evaluations in the second. 3 See: W. Kirfel, Die Kosmograpie der Inder nach den Quellen dargestellt, Bonn und Leipzig, 1920, S. 20* sq.; S. Kramrish, "The triple structure of creation in the Rg Veda"-History of Religions, vol. 2, N. 1, 1962, pp. 140 sq.; J. Gonda, Loka. World and heaven in the Veda. Amsterdam, 1966. 4 Cf. Ivanov, Toporov, Slavjanskie, pp. 204 sq. 5 We do not refer here to manifold "horizontal" aspects of this organization and corresponding symbolism, correlated to a certain degree with our dichotomy (cf. resp. "right"'-"left" opposition; see, e.g., Right and Left. Essays on dual sym- bolic classification, Ed. by R. Needham, Chicago, 1973). 6 The following of these paths is vividly represented here in corresponding descriptions that present a number of opposites correlated with "rise"- "descent": resp. "flame"'-"smoke", "day"'-"night", "North"-"South", " gods"-" fathers", "sun"-"moon", etc. Those who possess the genuine knowledge follow the first path through the flame, the day, the world of the gods, the sun, the lightning, and "to the worlds of Brahma .... of these there is no return" (The Principal Upanisads, ed. by S. Radhakrishnan, London, 1953, p. 314). The second path (of those performing regular rites) appears to be a partial ascent with subsequent descent (i.e. rebirth), a process repeated in the wheel of reincarnation; through the smoke (of the cremation fire), the night, the world of the father, the moon, etc. Then, passing from the space into rain with which they fall into the earth, they are born again. Cf. P. Thieme, "Der Weg durch den Him-</page><page sequence="15">The Salutary Descent 15 mel nach der Kaushitaki-Upanishad" '- Wiss.

Jordens, "The development of the idea of immortality in the Upanisads"- Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, vol. 16, N.1, 1966, pp. 1-17 etc. It is noteworthy that the right knowledge, secur- ing the way to Brahman and exposed in previous paragraphs (BU VI.2. 9-13; ChU V. 4-9) presents a theory, in an allegory of the five sacrificial "fires", of man's origin resulting from a process of descent. The first "fire" ("that" celestial world) impregnated by faith (fraddha, brought forth as a kind of oblation) gives birth to the king Soma (the moon). The latter is sacrificed in the second "fire"- Parjanya (the god of rain) and the rain is produced. The libation of rain in the third "fire" (the earth) produces food. The offering of food in the fourth "fire" (man) produces semen, and, finally, the libation of semen in the fifth "fire" (woman) leads to the birth of a human being. In another description of the dying person (ChU VI, 15.1-2) "his voice is merged in mind (manasi), mind in breath, breath in heat (tejasi), and heat in the highest deity" (parasyam devatayam- Principal Upanisads, p. 465). Cf. Noble Ross Reat, "Karma and rebirth in the Upanisads and Buddhism"'-Numen, v. 24, fasc. 3, 1977, pp. 163 sq. Concerning some analogies between birth and descent, on the one hand, and death and ascent of the soul, on the other, cf. M. Pulver, "Die Lichterfahrung in Johannes Evangelium im Corpus Hermeticum, in der Gnosis und in der Ostkirche"-EJ, 1943, Bd. X, S. 266 sq.; Eliade, Das Heilige, S. 83 sq. (on humi positio); C. G.

Buddha's ascent (vutthahitva) along the nine states (anupubba = vihara)-the four stages of absorption (jhana) and the five subsequent levels (ayatana)-is followed by his descent from the ninth state to the first, then by the second ascent to the fourth jhana, after which "he immediately expired" (Dialogues of the Buddha, tr. by T.

Kuhn zum 70. Geburtstag gewidmet, Miinchen, 1916, S. 357-387). This metaphorical ascent is accompanied by more traditional "spatial" signs of the gods' respect for the departing Teacher (heavenly flowers and sandal-wood powder falling from the sky all over his body; streams of water from the sky extinguishing his funeral pyre; etc.-DN XVI. 5. 2-3; 6. 23). 8 Cf.

Tolstoy's War and peace, R. M. Rilke's Ich liebe meines Wesens Dunkelstunden; B. Pasternak's Zimnie prazdniki a.o.). Cf. below, note 11.

But if he meditates on the highest person with the three elements of the syllable Aum (a, u, m), he becomes one with the light .... He is led .... to the world of Brahma" (Principal Upanisads, p. 665). Cf. further, PU V, 7 (ibid., p. 666): "With the rg (verses) (one attains) this world, with the yajus (for- mulas) .... the interspace and with the saman (chants) .... that which is tranquil, unaging, immortal, fearless and supreme." Other evidence (MaU 1 sq.) connects a-u-m with past, present and future, respectively; with the cognition (prajfia) of external objects, of internal objects and a "mass of cognition" (prajfiana = ghana), etc.; while the whole syllable is equal with 5.tman "which cannot be spoken of, into which the world is resolved, benign, non-dual" (ibid., pp. 695 sq.; cf. below note 97). The corresponding problem has been discussed at the earlier Eranos meetings (cf. e.g., papers of P. Masson-Oursel, C. A. F. Rhys Davids, J. Przyluski in EJ, 1936, 1937, Bd. IV, V.). 1 Cf. the Buddhist iconography: V. N. Toporov, "Zametki o buddijskom izobrazitel'nom iskusstve v svjazi s semiotikoj kosmologi'eskix predstavlenij", in: Works on semiotics, II, Tartu, 1965, pp. 225 sq.; E. D. Ogneva, "Struktura tibet- skoj ikony" in: Problema kanona v drevnem i srednevekovom iskusstve Azii i Afriki, Moskva, 1973, pp. 111 a.o. Analogous regularities pertain to the sphere of sculpture (cf. P. Mus, Barabudur, N.Y. 1978, pp. 633 sq.; B. Rowland, "Religious art East and West",-History of religions, v. 2, N. 1, 1962, pp. 21 sq.-on Bud- dha's "cosmological stature") and architecture-cf. e.g. the structure of Barabudur temple as the replica of the macrocosm (H. Zimmer, Kunstform und Yoga im Indischen Kultbild, Berlin, 1926, S. 94 etc.; Mus, Op. cit., p. 42 sq.; cf. Rowland, Op. cit., pp. 26 sq.; Anagarika Govinda, "Quelques aspects du sym- bolisme des Stupa"--Samadhi. Cahiers d'itudes bouddhiques, v. 8, N. 3-4, 1974, pp. 154-171; etc.). One can find similar regularities in Christian art: cf. cor- respondence of elements in the icon, where the three zones-resp. heaven, church (as the connecting link) and earth (or hall)-can be usually distinguished (This device undergoes a certain modification in Renaissance painting, due to the intro- duction of the three-dimensional representation based on the horizontal scheme as, e.g. in Fra Angelico's "The last Judgement"; cf. I. Danilova, Ot srednix vekov k vozrozdeni'u. Sloienie xudozestvennoj sistemy kartiny kvatrodento, Moskva, 1975, pp. 39 sq.). We find here also motifs of the tree, the ladder, etc. (cf. particularly a dynamic image of ascent and sinners' fall in the icon "Ladder of St. Jacob" from St. Catherine's Monastery in Sinai; the composition ofJ.

(on Hittite, Greek and other traditions). 13 Cf. the persistent emphasis on the advantages of inferior, dependent, despised state already in earlier Christian sources. We should mention, especially, the cases when humiliation is explicitly correlated to perfection and appears as a condition for elvation: Mt. 18.4: "Let a man humble himself ... and he will be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven"; Mt. 23, 12: "whoever exalts himself will be humbled; and whoever humbles himself will be exalted"; Lc. 14, 11; I Pet. 5.5; Jas. 4. 6; 10; see also: Mt. 5. 3 sq.; Lc. 4. 18; 6. 20 sq.; I. Cor. 1. 28; etc. The device of intentional self-denigration and humiliation, of hiding one's own merits, etc. is widespread in monastic tradition. Cf. e.g., W. Bousset, "Die verborgene Heilige"-Archivfiir Religionswissenschaft Bd. XXI, Leipzig-Berlin, 1922, S. 1-17 (the evidence of "Historia Lausiaca", Rufinus' Historia monachorum", etc.).

Bond, "Theravada Buddhism's meditations on death and the symbolism of initiatory death"--History of religions, vol. 19, N. 3, 1980, pp. 237 sq.; 249 sq. etc. The motif of the hero's journey, connected with the search for treasure or remedy, with cer- tain errand, etc. is widespread in folk-lore (cf., e.g. the motif of hero's departure: V. Propp, Morphology of the folktale, Austin and London, 1968, pp. 39 sq.; E. Meletinskij, Geroj volsebnoj skazki, Moskva, 1958, pp. 213-255, on the "low" hero of fairy-tales, etc.). We find a motif of pilgrimage where the hero's spiritual quest results in subsequent transformation, beginning with the most archaic epic texts down to modern fiction (as in H. Hesse's novels). These pilgrimages are, anyhow, marked by metaphorical (if not spatial) rise and descent. Such, for example, is the ancient Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh who goes in search of immortality through the land of darkness and the waters of Death (cf. particularly the tablets X-XI of Ninevian version: cf. e.g. F. M. Th. de Liagre B6hl, "Die Fahrt nach dem Lebenskraut"-Archiv Orientdlni, v. 18, N. 1-2, 1950, S. 107-122). On the sym- bolism of entering water cf. also: L.

XXIII, p. 90, etc. Cf. also with respect to the meaning of a pilgrim's transference in space: H. Corbin, "Pour une morphologie de la spiritualite ShiCite"--EJ, 1960, Bd. XXIX, pp. 100 sq.; Ju. M. Lotman, "O ponjatii geografi'eskogo prostranstva v russkix srednevekovyx tekstax", in: Works on semiotics, II, Tartu, 1965, pp. 210-216. W. Harms, Homo viator in bivio, Miin- chen, 1970; A. Ja. Gurevi', Kategorii srednevekovoj kul'tury, Moskva, 1972, pp. 65 sq.; etc. An example of corresponing spatial-ethic transference is presented in the traditional Hebrew usage of words "ascent" (Caliidh) and "descent" (ieriddh) designating, respectively, setting foot in the land of Israel and leaving it (the usage</page><page sequence="19">The Salutary Descent 19 remaining so relevant that the "rise"-'"descent" dichotomy, when uttered in Hebrew, would be unequivocally understood by every Israeli to be an allusion to the burning social question of his country's life). The notion of pilgrimage is analogously expressed here as "ascent on foot" (Caliidh leregel). One can note that its usual designation in European languages (cf. Lat. "peregrinatio" from "per- ager") is connected with the notion of transgressing the space (see below, note 33 on tr), while another tradition (cf. Fr. "paumier", Rus. "palomnik") has another significant connotation-the image of a tree. 20 Principal Upanisads, pp. 412-413. 21 Ibid., p. 797. 22 Ibid., p. 927. 23 Ibid., p. 404; cf.

Cf. L. Vygotskij, Psixologija iskusstva, Moskva, 1968, pp. 270 sq.; A. Syrkin, "Zametki o stilistike rannix upani'ad"'- Vestnik drevnej istorii, 1971, No. 2, pp. 99-100. The possible substitution of the guru or brahman precep- tor for the father figure in Hinduist tradition (e.g. Man. II 146 sq; 170 sq-see above) permits R. P. Goldman to suggest the elements of Oedipal conflict in respective (pupil-teacher) relations. Cf. R. P. Goldman, "Fathers, sons and gurus: Oedipal conflict in the Sanskrit epics"-Journal of Indian Philosophy V. 6, 1978. pp. 325-392. 27 Cf. E. Hopkins, Epic mythology, Strassburg, 1915, pp. 197 sq.; J.

IV, 1960, S. 52 sq. etc. Different functions of this universal device (fertilization, par- ticipating in the sacrifice, founding a kingdom-i.e. in ancient Corean legends) as well as cases of "substitutional" descent (see for example, Rev. 21.10, on see- ing "the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God"; or bring- ing down to earth the shrine of Visnu-Rahgana-tha in Sanskrit and Tamil texts- cf. D. D. Shulman, Tamil temple myths, Princeton, 1980, p. 49) each present a com- plicated problem and cannot be discussed here. The same applies to different aspects of the Saiour's manifestation (cf. below) manifoldly reflected in the history of religions. (cf. e.g., some examples in: W. Ruben, Krishna. Konkordanz und Kom- mentar der Motive seines Heldenlebens, Istambul, 1944, S. 48-49.). 28 Cf. A. Macdonell, Vedic mythology, Strassburg, 1897, pp. 37 sq.; R. G.

Syrkin 31 Cf. Der Rig- Veda, uibers v. K. F. Geldner, II T., Cambridge, Mass., 1951, p. 270. The variability of Visnu's images (especially as a dwarf) is associated, in V. Machek's opinion, with magic (V. Machek, "Origin of the god Visnu"- Archiv Orientdlni, v. 28, 1960, pp. 105 sq.). 32 The genetic correspondences of these fusions, so important in later Vishnuite mythology and ritual (e.g., in sects of paficaratrin, bhagavata, etc.), remain unclear in certain points. Moreover, the problems of Visnu-Narayana, Visnu- Vasudeva, etc. are subject to controversy (cf. Bhandarcar, Op. cit., pp. 30 sq.; Gonda, Aspects, pp. 160 sq.; etc.). One can note that, although worshipping Visnu beside other Hindu gods has survived till the present time, his cult as the unique embodiment of highest deity (a principle in a way originating in Vedic henotheism-cf. Macdonell, Op. cit., pp. 16-17) proved to be much more impor- tant in the history of Vishnuism. 33 Cf. Hacker, Op. cit., pp. 547-570, particularly pp. 549 sq., 558 sq. on corre- sponding usage of pradurbhava ("manifestation"), avatarana, bharavatarana ("Abwdilzen der Last von der Erde"), etc. It is noteworthy that the verb tr, tarati ("cross over", "surpass", "reach the end", etc.) became one of the main designations of spiritual salvation (as crossing over worldly sorrows, the flood of existence, of samsara, etc.), while its causative tarayati refers respectively to sav- ing others. Cf. KtU I, 1.12; 17 (tarati janma-mrtyi--"crosses over birth and death"); MuU III, 2.9; PU VI, 8 (yo 'smakam avidyayah param param tarayasi-"Thou .... who does take us across to the other shore of ignorance"), etc. (Principal Upanisads, pp. 602, 668, etc.). This usage is no less widespread in Buddhist tradition, in the notion of a person who has crossed the world of sorrows, crossed "the flood", attained nibbana-tinna, oghatinna, etc. (DN. XXV, 21; Dhp. 195; Sn 21, 178, 823, 1082, 1145, etc.). Cf. also the functions of Tara deity, particularly in Mahayana Buddhism. See I. B. Horner, The early Buddhist theory of man perfected, London, 1936, pp. 259 sq.; E. Conze, "Buddhist saviours", in: Thirty years of Buddhist studies", Oxford, 1967, p. 35, etc. An evident connection of tr with tirtha ("passage", "ford", etc.-cf. Mayrhofer, Op. cit., Bd. I, pp. 480, 507; D. L. Eck, "India's tirthas: "crossings" in sacred geography"--History of Religions, vol. 20, No. 4, 1981, pp. 323 sq.; 329 sq.; etc.) makes this root most significant in Jaina tradition as well, where the concept of tirthaflkara ("creating a passage", "ford-finder"--an epithet testified similarly with respect to Visnu and Siva) designates the chiefJaina saint preaching salvation (cf. below, note 58). Cf. C. J. Bleeker, The sacred bridge, Leiden, 1963, S. 80 sq.; 84 sq. ("Die religi6se Bedeutung der Briicke"). 34 Cf. Monier-Williams, p. 99. 35 See, e.g., S. N. Farquhar, An outline of the religious literature of India, Oxford, 1920, p. 231; J. Filliozat, "Les dates du Bhagavatapurana et du Bhagavatamahat- mya", in: Indological studies in honor of W. N.

M. Winternitz, A history of Indian literature, v. III, Calcutta, 1959, pp. 60 sq. 38 The present world period in Indian cosmology (kalpa) is named vardha after this exploit. 39 It is noteworthy that certain supernatural qualities, bringing Hirainyakalipu, Bali and other demons to power and serving a cause for Visnu's avatairas, were</page><page sequence="21">The Salutary Descent 21 obtained as a boon for great austerities (tapas), humiliation, etc. or for a kind of "descent" (cf. above). However, regarding asuras, these trials bring them no benefit, but rather lead them to temporary "social" ascent accompanied as a rule by moral degradation. This result is contrary to that of pious men and to the gods themselves (see below). Cf. SB II. 2.2.6 on brahmanas as the "human gods" whose descent leads to real perfection (cf. SB II. 2.2.9. sq.: "The gods were left inferior. They went on practising and practising austerities, hoping that they might be able to overcome their enemies, the mortal Asuras ... and having ... become immortal, and unconquerable, they overcame their mortal conquerable enemies''- The Satapatha-brdhmana, tr. byJ. Eggeling, pt. I, Delhi, 1966, pp. 310- 311). This difference corresponds to the traditional opposition between gods and asuras in Vedic and epic evidence. Cf. above (ChU VIII, 7 sq.) concerning opposite results of Indra's and Virocana's studies-not only because of asuras' inherent wickedness, but also because of the god's scheming (cf. MtU VII, 9-10). This opposition of the genuine gods' and false asuras' ascent, in connection with moral superiority of the former and inferiority of the latter, is expressed most explicitly with subsequent ethical deducation in SB IX, 5.1. 16-17: "The gods spake nothing but truth, and Asuras nothing but untruth. And the gods, speaking the truth diligently, were very contemtible, and very poor: whence he who speaks the truth diligently, becomes indeed very contemptible, and very poor; but in the end he assuredly prospers, for the gods indeed prospered. And the Asuras speak- ing untruth ... were very prosperous: whence he who speaks untruth diligently, thrives indeed ... and becomes very prosperous; but in the end he assuredly comes to naught, for the Asuras indeed came to naught" (ibid., pt. IV, pp. 257-258). 40 According to separate versions, with his third step Visnu pierces the roof of the universe and intrudes into Brahman's Satyaloka. Thereafter, the divine river Gafiga flows from the crevice down to the earth, as a tribute to his deed (cf. BP VIII. 21. 1-3; Kfirma purana I. 16. 56; Vamana purana 65.32-34). Here we come across a well-known motif in Hindu mythology and iconography (cf. the famous relief "Descent of the Gafiga" in Mamallapuram), a motif also pertinent to our theme-a benefactory descent of the sacred river from heaven to earth (cf. note 27). The "mother Gangai" is often personified in Hindu tradition as a river- goddess, wife of Visnu, of Siva, etc. Cf. e.g., S. G. Darian, The Ganges in myth and history, Honolulu, 1978, esp. pp. 17 sq. 41 Krsna, son of Devaki appears also in ChU III, 17. 6 where he himself receives from Ghora Aigirasa an admonition leading to final liberation. Cf. S. K. De, "The Vedic and the epic Krsna, " in: Aspects of Sanskrit literature, Calcutta, 1959, pp. 31 sq. 42 Cf. Bhandarkar, Op. cit., pp. 35 sq.; R. Garbe, Indien und Christentum, Tiib- ingen, 1914, S. 218; De, Op. cit., pp. 31-35; A. Ch. Chakravarti, The story of Krsna in Indian literature, Calcutta, 1976; etc. Certain traits of Krsna's image led to numerous comparisons with Christ-attempts which were sometimes justified from the typological point of view (motifs such as persecution of the divine child, pastor-saviour, etc.). They are, however, doubtful with respect to the possibility of genetic influence (e.g., thanks to the presumed activity of early Christians in India)-cf. A. Keith, "The child Krishna".--Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, pp. 169-175; Garbe, Op. cit., S. 201 sq.; Hopkins, Op. cit., p. 216, n. 1; etc.; cf. also E. G. Suhr, "Krishna and Mithra as Messiahs"-Folklore, vol. 77, 1966, pp. 205-221. 43 We find Buddha's iconographic representation, preserving some traits typical of him, among other Visnu's incarnations in a Sirpur shrine (ca. VIII cent.</page><page sequence="22">22 A. Syrkin A.D.)-cf. Bhandarkar, Op. cit., p. 45. Concerning some characteristic modifica- tions of Buddha's image within the framework of different traditions cf. P. H. Pott, "Plural forms of Buddhist iconography", in: India Antiqua, Leiden, 1947, pp. 284 sq. Cf. also A. J. Gail, "Buddha as avatara Visnus im Spiegel der Puranas", in: XVII. Deutscher Orientalistentag, Wiirzburg, 1968, T. III, Wiesbaden, 1969, S. 917-923 (evidence of BP I. 3. 24; MP 24. 47; Visnu purana IV, 9. 8, etc.). One can add that Buddha's image entered Christian (St. Ioasaph) tradition as well. See, for example, P. P. Alfaric, "La vie chretienne du Buddha" -Journal Asiatique, XI sir., t. X, 1917, pp. 269-288. 44 Buddhist dogmatics regard being born in the form of a god as the result of certain merits, which lift the mortal to a higher level. The latter, however, yields to the complete cessation of rebirths-the state of an arahant, of Buddha. See, e.g., the superiority of arahant over the previous state of anagamin ("non- returner" )-a designation of the person who is born in a higher world of gods and does not return to earth, though he has not yet attained nibbana. The motif of Buddha's admonition to the gods is found, e.g., in Sakkapafiha sutta (DN XXI), where Sakka (or Indra, king of gods) asks him questions. In Mahasamaya sutta (DN XX) "the great concourse" of gods assembles to contemplate Buddha and other arahants (cf. also signs of gods' veneration in Mahaparinibbana (DN XVI 5.2 sq. etc.). Concering the role of corresponding beliefs in Buddhism see: Swami Jagadiswarananda, "Buddhism and the Vedas"-The Scholar, v. 7, N. 7, 1932, pp. 377-386; J. Masson, La religion populaire dans le canon bouddhique pdli, Louvain, 1942; T. P. Bhattacharya, "Brahma cult and Buddhism"--Journal of the Bihar Research Society, v. 42, pt. 1, 1956, pp. 91-115; B.

Norman, "The Buddha's view of Devas", in: Beitrage zur Indienforschung E. Waldsschmidt zum 80. Geburtstag gewidmet, Berlin, 1977, S. 329-336; etc. Analogous reception of Hindu gods (like Indra, Krsna, etc.) is also characteristic of Jainism, with its similar hierarchy placing these gods, still subject to the karmic world, lower than the tirthafikaras, who have completely destroyed their karmas (cf. The world ofJainism, ed. by V. Pandey, Bombay, 1976, p. 86). 45 Cf. E. Abegg, Der Messiaglaube in Indien und Iran, Berlin und Leipzig, 1928, S. 39 sq.; J.

(papers of R. Panikkar, R. Puligandla, a.o.). 49 At the same time the last (Kalki) image can also be treated as mixed- anthropomorphic-theriomorphic-cf. his representations as a man with a horse's head, or even as a horse (Abegg, Op. cit., ill. I to p. 47). A certain ambiguity also marks the ethical image of Kalki whose salutary mission is accompanied by terrify- ing acts of destruction. The meaning of "Kalki" ("foul", "wicked", etc.) and its possible connotations with ideas of destruction, death, etc. (cf. Kala) are sug- gestive in this respect. Cf. Monier-Williams, p. 262; Mayrhofer, Op. cit., Bd. I, p. 183; see Abegg, Op. cit., pp. 47, 139 sq.; Przyluski, Op. cit., pp. 4 sq. 50 It is clear from the present exposition that we are dealing first and foremost with canonical and didactic evidence on the "spiritual" salvation. The problem of "physical" salvation, though closely connected with sacral thematics (and, as Visnu's avataras show, particularly with "salutary descents") more often passes from canonical texts to folklore, epics and other literary genres. 51 Cf. Hopkins, Op. cit., p. 202; L. Renou, "L'ambiguite du vocabulaire du Rgveda", in: Journal Asiatique, t. 231, 1939, pp. 224 a.o. (valuable evidence of ambivalent lexical usage, with respect to some Vedic gods); Syrkin, K xarakteristike, pp. 162; etc. Cf. below, note 107. 52 Cf. A. Syrkin, "O poetike "Gitagovindy" in: Narody Azii i Afriki, 6, 1970, p. 102; L.

Ruben (Krishna, S. 253 sq., 284) comes to the conclusion that in spite of his positive role he displays a lack of such altruistic traits as constancy, patience, charity. Cf. Suhr, Op. cit., pp. 211 sq., C. G. Hospital. "Paradox and divine wickedness in the Krishnakarnamrita: reflections on the uses of discrepant symbols" in: Journal of Asian and African Studies, XV, 1-2, 1980, pp. 59-71, etc. 54 The motif of subjugation in love is particularly expressed in Gitagovinda: "like a slave" (11.22) Krsna worships his beloved's feet, helps to restore her toilet (10.7; 24.17 sq.), etc. His love-effusions sometimes sound quite masochistic-see 10.3 ("give me a wound with the arrows that are your sharp nails ..."); 10.8 ("place the noble sprout of your foot as an ornament upon my head..."); cf. 10.11; 11.2; 12.11; etc. See Siegel, Op. cit., pp. 93 sq.; 274; 279; A.
