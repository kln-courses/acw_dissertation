<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTOIRE GENERALE DES RELIGIONS: GRECE-ROME, avec la collaboration de Jean Charbonneaux, Pierre Fabre, A. J. Festugiere, Martin P. N. Nilsson. Pp. 417, color pls. 11, pls. 53, figs. ca. 430. Paris, Aristide Quillet, 1944. This handsome volume in large format is a part of a general history of religions which will include other volumes such as: Primitive Religions; Indo-Iranians, Judaism, Early Christianity; Medieval Christianity; Modern Catholicism, Islam, The Far East. The illus- trations are superb and include 11 inserted color plates, 53 full-page photographs and about 430 additional pictures smaller than page size. Although the work is intended primarily for the general reader, there are 28 pages of notes and bibliography at the end of the book as well as a table of contents, but no index. The scholarship in this work is of uniformly high quality as one would expect from such authors. Espe- cial attention is called, however, to the remarkable chapters on Greek Religion by Festugiere and Greek Greek Mythology by Nilsson. Nowhere in the work will one find use made of extreme hypotheses and dubious interpretations. Both scholarship and inter- pretation throughout the work are sound, honest, and workmanlike. This treatment will be an excellent corrective to much of the highly speculative and even fanciful reconstruction that has been done in this field during the past. The authors appear to have a deep and sympathetic understanding of religious exper- ience which gives them a true hand in the use of docu- ments. The chapters by Festugiere are most remarkable. In laying the fundamental framework for his treatment, he insists upon the importance of localism, tradition, and Oa'#4os which he aptly translates with the English word "awe" and the Latin "stupor." He points out that seeing the divine in nature was not an inference to the Greek but a voluntary act of imagination -an apperception, not a creation -hence a real epiphany. He denies that anthropomorphism develops from fetishism and that magic precedes religion. In this regard, he remarks very appropriately that religion involves man's dependence on the god, magic, the god's dependence on man-a penetrating observa- tion. One knows of no general treatment of Greek religion equal to the one given here by Festugiere. Roman religion is disappointing, of course, but that is not the fault of the author primarily. Our in- formation is scanty and difficult to handle. It should be pointed out that no attempt has been made here to give an adequate treatment of Roman religion dur- ing the imperial period, while the treatment of religion under the Republic, though brief, is adequate and sound. Considerations of space and the many illustrations have required a brief, compact text. This is quite commendable since the fine illustrations add so much to the treatment of the subject.
