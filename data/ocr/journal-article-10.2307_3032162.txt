<plain_text><page sequence="1">OF JAPANESE MONKEYS Taking cognizance of man as a primate gives a broader perspective on him. In this article, instead of an investigation of the scarce fossil record, observations of Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) are used. It has been at least 20 million years since man shared a comnmon ances- tor with any of the living species of monkey. Nevertheless, on the scale of evolutionary history this is not that long, and many useful comparisons can be made. They make us aware of major long-term continuities which link the behaviour of humans to that of monkeys, and also help to illuminate ways in which humans are unique. The study of the behaviour, society and ecology of the Japanese monkey started in 1948. The difficulties of observing wild monkeys, driven into the steep mountains because of urbaniza- tion in Japan, were accelerated and led to the adoption of the method of arti- ficial feeding in 1952, which allowed for closer observation. Japanese prima- tologists gave names to individuals, families and groups. Moreover, they tried to behave as members of a monkey society in an attempt to lose themselves within the monkey conscious- ness, and thus share their experience. In other words, their approach was subjective. This anthropomorphic app- roach has been criticised on the grounds that such a study is less natural, less representative and less statistical. But the long period of observation (more than 25 years) has successfully solved a lot of problems concerning group terri- tories, group relations, close social bonds, cooperation in groups, etc. Further- more even the emotions, intelligence and 'culture' of monkeys could be gradually analysed. These words used to be avoided in scientific studies; but the washing and dipping of potatoes in salt water in order to season them, the soaking of wheat in order to sort it from sand, and the use of methods of pro- tecting thenselves from coldness by bathing in hot springs, showed the intellectual level of monkeys and their ability to invent new behaviour and communicate it to the rest of the society. The learning of new behaviour takes place more rapidly in younger monkeys. The monkeys' learning is different from human learning only in degree. There- fore the results of the experiments which used artificial feeding have shed new light on aspects of human behaviour. The drawback of this method is that the artificial situation produced by the feeding of the monkeys may bias the information on territory, social structure, and aggression. Such subtle effects may not be immediately perceived or controlled by the experimenter.</page><page sequence="2">The distribution of Japanese monkeys has a wide range from 30 degrees to 40 degrees latitude (almost the whole of the Japanese Islands except Hokkaido). There are more than 40,000 individuals and 425 troops (1962), which have increased four times since artificial feeding was started. The Takasakiyama troop included 570 individuals and is believed to be the biggest troop in the world. Takasakiyama, as well as other regions, is rich with various trees from a continuous woodland to pure grassland. Woodland is thin and seasonally bare; light can penetrate to the ground, permitting the characteristic growth of vigorous ground cover. Each food resource becomes available in its season and then disappears, so that Japanese monkeys must be able to move on the ground between food resources and should also be adapted to feeding on the ground at least during part of the year. For instance, at Shiroyama they circulate from the rocky hills during the late winter to grassland during the spring, steep mountains during the rainy season, the cool coppices during the summer, the grape area in October, and the low- lands in November, December and January. Japanese monkeys, like most other primates, are omnivores, eating a mixed diet of fruit, leaves, insects, nuts, berries etc. Their dietary profiles, how- ever, vary in each troop. The growth of the monkeys also varies. (Usually, we class a monkey of less than six months as a baby, up to three years old as a child, between three and eight as a juvenile, between 8 to 25 as an adult, and over 25 as old.) For Japanese monkeys, mating, feed- ing, sleeping, growth of the individual, and protection from predators (humans only), are not matters for solitary individuals to solve, but are performed in a highly complex social organization. Factors within the organization deter- mine the social status and the social role of each member of the troop. Individuals make constant assessments of social situations before acting, especially of the rank system. This enables them to act collectively and harmoniously. The pattern of the rank system is similar among all troops, but its cohesion varies in degree. Depending upon the social structure, certain individuals stay in the central part, and other individuals stay on the periphery. If there are females, infants, and leading males in the central part and younger adults, subleaders, and low ranking males on the periphery, their social rank system is well organised into dominant and submissive behaviours. It is called a 'J-type' group. Other groups have an 'A-type' of social organisation, which consists of three or four kinship groups centred on females and infants; males which have formed their own group outside of the troop freely come in and out of the centre of such troops. In the 'A-type', a social signal called 'dominance-mounting' is not seen so often as in 'J' groups. The tension of the 'A' type group is low and loose. The inter- mediate between a J- and an A-type group is called a 'G' type. Once it was believed that ecological factors, or the number in the troop, influenced the social structure of the troop; but recently, it has been suggested that the social structure often depends on the leader's personality. Social ranks are determined not only by physiological, but also by psychological and social factors. Such physiological factors as maturity, weight, health, physical strength, etc. establish the 'basic' rank. This brings about the linear relationship between ranks and ages among Japanese monkeys. This correlation, however, is changed in various ways resulting in the 'dependent' rank formed by psychological or social forces. One such dependent rank is deter- mined by the effect of the baby's depend- ence on the mother. For instance, when a piece of potato was thrown in between two young monkeys, A and B, it was taken for granted that A, who was of a higher basic rank, would go to it first; but an exception happened: B grabbed the potato first, because her own mother was nearby. Psychologically B sensed that her mother would back her up if she took the potato. In short, the dependent rank is based on kinship. According to Kawai's observation at Koshima (1962), the younger children also often obtain privileges by depend- ing on their elder sisters, and even on a grandmother. The social structure of Japanese mon- keys is made up of a central part and a peripheral part, as I explained before. The effect of dependence is strongest in the central part of the troop and grows weaker at the periphery. Solitary males outside of the troop are lowest in dependent rank although they are comparatively high in basic rank. Indeed, Kawai found that a young female didn't CLUD LEVI -- -STRAUSS Structural Anthropology Volume 11 The English edition of Volume II of Levi-Strauss's classic work. ?6.50 Structural/ Anthropology / Volume I / ?5.95 Other works by Levi-Strauss available in Penguins are Tristes-Tropiques ?1.50 Totemism ?1.00 Allen Lane ii 2</page><page sequence="3">hesitate to grab the potato even in front of a big solitary male. Some females raise their dependent rank by using the higher status of their mating partners. A head female that depends on the highest ranking troop leader obtains more advantages than other male leaders when her mate is nearby. Such roles as leader, subleader, etc. are clearly related to social ranks. These roles, however, are not neces- sarily fixed by the social ranks in a mon- key society. Japanese monkeys acquire their rank in the early infant period. They soon learn the effect of dependence through their mothers and their kinships. One year after birth they experience their dependent rank. Usually individuals that are brought up with the benefits of a strong parent have more chance of reaching a high basic rank, which is obtained by taking a dominant attitude. Once this rank is established it remains fixed and does not easily change, as it makes up the basis of social relationships among individuals of a troop. At the age of three or four, young males leave the troop to live in the peripheral part. Later, some return to the central part of the troop while some become solitary males. Thus, their status and role in the society change as they grow up. On the other hand, females grow up under the protection of their mothers and remain in the central part of the troop. A male monkey whose mother is extremely dominant may never be exiled to the peripheral part but may grow up in the central part of the troop, making a smooth transition from the status of privileged infant to that of leading male monkey. Naturally he learns to behave in a dominant and self-assured manner while he can count on his mother's support. Thus, one particular kinship group whose members are united by blood dominates other such groups in the troop. At the individual level, the system of dominance-sub- ordination relations allows individuals in a troop to predict the outcome of interactions when they compete for food, space, or an oestrous female. Such predictions are advantageous in promoting reproductive success, and are thus transmitted down the generations. Yumiko Ishikawa This article is based on: - Kawai, M.
