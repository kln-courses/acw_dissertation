<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Twilight of Christianity. By Harry Elmer Barnes. (New York: Vanguard Press. 1929. Pp. xi, 470.) A little over a year ago I was given this book to review, which task I undertook immediately. Finding it replete with quotations from the daily newspapers recounting the excesses of religious fanatics or the exaggera? tions of sentimentalists, I decided to leave the book rest for one year before undertaking a criticism. Now one year has passed, and the book is already out of date in the sense that it is behind the times. The passing of time may make things better, as it does with wine, or it may make things obsolete, as it does with hate. It has had the latter sad effect on this book. Even professors of ancient history would probably avow that nothing is more ancient than yesterday's newspapers?except possibly this book of Mr. Barnes which abounds with quotations from the Forum of June, 1929, the New York Times of September 1, 1929, June 23, 1929, the New York Telegram of July, 1929, Liberty for April 6, 1929, Baltimore Evening Sun for August 24, 1928?and a hundred other such dates and papers. In a word, this book now has as little thrill and interest as an old newspaper. The author proposes to do three things : "(1) to subject present religious positions to the test of the best knowledge which we possess today; (2) to reject those aspects of belief which are clearly out of date; and (3) to present man with a religion which will not be an affront to his intelligence." After two readings of this book I have come to the conclusion that it suffers from three serious defects: (1) it fails to subject present religious positions to the test of the best knowledge which we possess today; (2) it fails to reject those aspects of religion which are clearly out of date; (3) it presents man with a religion which is a positive affront to his intelligence. First of all, it fails to make use of the best knowledge we have today. After professing modernity the author quotes on the subject of the science of religion the two antiquated works of the last century of Draper and White. There is not one single reference to any work on a scientific or religious subject outside of English?and what man is there who would equate English-speaking authorities with "the best knowledge we have today " ! On the subject of Christology, Mr. Barnes quotes the antiquated Keim, the discredited Robertson and Smith and the exploded Schweitzer. There is not the slightest evidence that he ever heard of Grandmaison, and who is there au courant with scholarship who does not know his master? piece? It is now being translated into English and perhaps will find its 464</page><page sequence="2">BOOK BEVIEWS 465 way sooner or later into Mr. Barnes's list of readings. On the subject of Scripture, Lagrange and Pope are passed over without mention, which omission might be excusable in someone who did not profess to "make use of the best knowledge we have today". The list of omissions might be continued indefinitely, but suffice it here to note that the author's definition of "the best knowledge we have today" is the "best anti Christian and anti-Theistic literature we have whether it is of today or yesterday." If the best of references found in the book constitute the " best knowledge we have today " then I wonder what must be the worst. Probably the worst is the book which gathers them all together. Secondly, the author has failed to reject those aspects of religion which are clearly out of date. Certainly the Positivism of Comte is very much out of date in religion, and yet the author in the first part of the chapter entitled : " The Religion of Tomorrow ", pleads once more for Comte's secular religion and the elimination of the supernatural. Furthermore, science is gradually disavowing that it should dictate the content of religion. Haldane, for example, stresses the separation of science and categories, whereas Eddington and Jeans and Meyerson admit religion has a different way of knowing than science. And yet Mr. Barnes is so much behind the times as to advocate a religion in which God is sought, " if at all, in terms of the findings of the test tube, the compound microscope, the interferometer, the radium tube and Einstein's ?quations." In one breath the author complains against anthropomorphism, or the interpre? tation of God in terms of human categories, and then in the next lays down a physicomorphism, or an interpretation of God in terms of physics. Professor Eddington, who is modern and who is a scientist, has said, "I positively repudiate any attempt to make the categories of religion fit the categories of science." This is the general opinion today among lead? ing philosophers of science, and in rejecting it, Mr. Barnes has failed to "reject those aspects of religion which are clearly out of date." And what is more, does Mr. Barnes think that time makes things true? Time does make for change, but it does not mean that every time we change our hat we must also change our head. And as for giving us a new religion, Mr. Barnes has done nothing more than to give us old paganism with ail its despair and above all its hatred. Finally, the author presents man with a religion which ia a positive affront to his intelligence. Only to an intelligence void of the meaning of terms can this sentence of the author be acceptable : " The greatest of all the Sacraments, that of the Mass, we know was established by St. Paul." Only an intelligence which never reads the Acts or the Epistles of St. Paul could comprehend this affront : " St. Paul was not friendly with or sym? pathetic toward the actual Apostles and hence made no effort to exploit his opportunities to learn about Jesus after his conversion to Christianity."</page><page sequence="3">466 BOOK BEvTEWS Only an intelligence ignorant of Patristic Theology could possibly swallow this statement : " So evil was woman and her temptation to sexual indul? gence regarded (by official Christianity) that St. Augustine even revised the doctrine of original sin. He held that original sin was sexual inter? course." And on and on these misinformed and unscholarly statements follow until one marvels that any brain could be so superficial as to absorb them all. Not only in erroneous statements of fact, but also in principle the book is an affront to the intelligence. It is an affront to any thinking man to explain religion by non-religious factors, just as it is unscientific to explain chemical substances by non-chemical factors. It is an insult to intelligence to take the many-headed manifestations of religion among the orthodox, the fanatics, the sentimentalists, the exotics, and give them all the neck of superstition in order the better with one full swoop to decapitate them all. It is an affront to the intelligence to assume that because many religions have the same factors, that therefore they all have the same cause, which would be just like arguing that because many of the pictures in the Louvre have the same colors, therefore they were painted by the same artist. It is an affront to an intelligence to quote an ex-priest as an authority on the subject of the mind, spirit, and the teaching of the Church. Trained as an historian, it is only natural to expect that the author would write like one, and use original and trustworthy sources instead of the cheap, unreliable and at times altogether misinformed authorities which he does quote. Fundamentally this book is a rather ragged attack on Christianity and one which proves conclusively that today Christianity is without enemies worthy of her steel. It will never attract any attention except among the unscientific and unscholarly to whom it has been addressed. The author has never looked at Christianity in the daylight but only in the twilight, and that is probably why he calls his book " The Twilight of Christianity ". If the book has any merit it comes only from the choice of the subject to be attacked. The author's pen would have sunk into silence and oblivion if it had been dipped in the black ink of any other hatred than the hatred of the Everlasting. Fui/ron J. Sheen.
