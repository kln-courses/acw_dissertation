<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITORIAL An Unheard-of Organology hen we look to the past to better understand the present, sometimes things go missing: they go unreported or under-reported; they never existed or never rose into a position to be noticed. Usually, a combination of a number of factors is at work. When it comes to music, miss- ing sounds are literally unheard of, and the classification of their techniques and technologies is an unheard-of organology. Of course, when something is unheard of, it can also entail a form of abuse. Luckily, one of the natural habitats of abuse is the editorial, so I would like to take this opportunity to argue for two new organological categories: aural instruments and significant instruments. AURAL INSTRUMENTS Conventional musical instruments are modeled upon the utterance, whether the voice is the instru- ment or the utterance takes the form of an act of performing upon any other instrument. Simply stated, we have instrument organologies that privilege sending over receiving. But before discussing aural instruments, shouldn't we rethink instruments of utterance? And where better to start than with the voice? The voice in Western culture was long dependent upon a soul situated singularly and centrally along the axis of a symmetrical body. The same position within the body is also occupied by the pineal gland, which Descartes thought housed the soul, and the mouth itself. Two technical practices dislocated the voice forever: (1) phrenology and early neurology and (2) phonography. On FranzJoseph Gall's map of the scalp, speech was located off center near the left frontal lobe, where, in 1839, the French physician Jean Baptiste Bouillaud found it upon the corti- cal surface of a patient who had, in a botched suicide, shot off part of his skull. Bouillaud wrote, "Cu- rious to know what effect it would have on speech if the brain were compressed, we applied to the exposed part a large spatula pressing from above downwards and a little from front to back. With moderate pressure, speech seemed to die on his lips; pressing harder and more sharply, speech not only failed but a few words were cut off suddenly" [ 1]. In a new organology, Bouillaud's spatula would stand proudly next to violins, French horns and the Moog Synthesizer; is it not to the voice what the piano key is to the string? Or is it the first mod- ern sampler, albeit in reverse, because the sound is muted? Likewise, when the British neurologist Wilder Penfield placed, as though it were a phonographic needle settling upon an LP record, a wire electrode down upon the cortical grooves of a patient, the patient swore he heard a gramophone playing in the room. 'You did have one did you not?" he asked Penfield afterwards [2]. Instead of bringing flesh upon wire while playing an electric guitar, electric wire is brought down upon flesh to create an instrument that plays hearing from the biorecording technology called memory. Please don't try this at home. Conventional uttered instruments can be in the spirit of Romanticism, where the voice and human expression has presumptuous, transfigurative power, or in that "O" at the head of each line of Expres- sionist poetry intent upon rhyming with "cosmos." The same can be found underlying the performed intervals structuring the music of the spheres and in almost all the synaesthetic systems arising within spiritism, French Symbolism and the Russian avant-garde, in which the two sonic elements attendant upon humans thatjust so happen to be tied up in the heavens are the periodic waveforms of musical tones and those of spoken vowels. There would be no problem with this if it were simply humans making designs upon the heavens or talking to each other, but there are a number of other species who, as history has proven, suffer terribly when humans are too involved in what it is to be human. The human ear, however, hears the human voice among all the sounds in the world. Although the phonograph was known early on as the Speaking Machine, it was also a listening machine. It not only set the voice askew from the body's symmetrical soul, it exiled the voice from the body entirely, sending it out to where all things are heard. Preceded scriptually by the alphabeti- cal recording of speech and the notational recording of music, it was the first general mode of sound recording to record all sound. Coupled with this ability was a new paradigmatic notion of sound wherein ideas about one sound and all sound proliferated. Over three decades later, Luigi Russolo became the first person to systematically incorporate this phonographic aesthetic within music. Later on, we could clearly hear the phonograph speaking when John Cage called for sounds to be heard in themselves and proclaimed that all sounds can be LEONARDO MUSIC JOURNAL, Vol. 5, pp. 1-3, 1995 1 ? 1995 ISAST</page><page sequence="2">music; one need only listen. Both Russolo and Cage partook of an important musical strategy of the avant-garde, whereby music, previously consisting of sounds proscribed by the utterances of conven- tional musical performance, went outside this sphere to incorporate all audible or potentially au- dible sounds. However, it is important to keep in mind that, contrary to how the widespread uncritical reception of Cage's ideas would have it, the outcome of a desire (wherever one might find it) to hear all the sounds of the world as music not only reiterates the totalizing strains within regimes of utterance, but also runs counter to his professed anti-anthropomorphism. In the name of the dissolution of the ego, Cage heard the world through a patently human category, achieving through centripetal means what the Romantic voice achieved centrifugally. Cage pushed listening quite aggressively to the ex- tent that he said that there was no such thing as silence; its impossibility was certified by the anechoic chamber in which he heard his blood circulating and nervous system in operation. Moreover, microphony might make the entire inaudible world, including molecular vibrations, subject to listen- ing and thus to music: "That we have no ears to hear the music the spores shot off from basidia make obliges us to busy ourselves microphonically" [3]. This denial of the finitude of human audition be- longs to the realm of denials that has historically fueled American enthusiasms and assuaged culpa- bility, and it demonstrates a desire for an aphenomenal pervasiveness of sound that exceeds that of light: there is no night for the Cagean ear. Nevertheless, Cage was an important builder and user of two of the more notable aural instru- ments: the piano and the anechoic chamber itself. The piano that "played" Cage's 4'33" is simply the inverse of the piece performed in the anechoic chamber: muting the surrounding sounds, the anechoic chamber made the sounds of the body audible, whereas muting the piano displaced atten- tion to the surrounding sounds. There are rare precursors to Cage's muting: Mayakovsky said after a visit to New York that one should not "extoll noise but ... put up sound absorbers, we poets must talk in the cars"[4] and the Dadaist Tristan Tzara suggested that "everything which might make a sharp sound will be covered with a thin layer of rubber" [5]. The de-amplification of the anechoic chamber, the 4'33" piano, Bouillaud's spatula and Tzara's rubber are simply the inverse in music, speech and sound of the Cagean microphone that amplifies absolutely everything. The Cagean microphone has many more precursors, including a conjecture within the 1933 Italian Futurist radio manifesto La Radia, by F.T. Marinetti and Pino Masnata: "The reception, amplification and transfiguration of vibrations emitted by matter. Just as today we listen to the song of the forest and the sea so tomorrow shall we be seduced by the vibrations of a diamond or a flower" [6]. And in the late nineteenth century there was Thomas Edison's "molecular music," accidentally discovered as a result of the inadvertent production of sound by means of the carbon button amplifying the stressed movements of the telephone handle. An assistant amplified his memory of this carbon button: "The passage of a delicate camel's hair brush was magnified to the roar of a mighty wind. The footfalls of a tiny gnat sound like the tramp of Rome's cohorts. The tick- ing of a watch could be heard over a hundred miles" [7]. In Takehisa Kosugi's Micro I, from the mid-1960s, a large sheet of paper is crumpled around a live microphone and then left alone to let loose its sounds as it expands: this pun on sheet music implies that scores, having sufficient materiality and potential for movement, need no instrumental pe rform- ers to make music. The insects and other phenomena in David Dunn's recent Chaos &amp; The Emergent Mind of the Pond (recorded by means of hydrophones in North American fresh-water ponds) would make us agree with David Cronenberg's Brundle-Fly that the emergent mind has contributing to it a full-scale insect philosophy. Dunn's critique of Cage argues that Cage decontextualized and musicalized sounds, whereas, "My direct experience of nature convinces me that the worlds I hear are saturated with an intelligence emergent from the very fullness of interconnection which sustains them. Every living being is a sacred event reaching out from its unique coherence to construct a re- ality. We need not anthropomorphize the life around us. Instead we may celebrate those mysterious occasions which have given rise to each form of mind" [8]. Speaking of mind, Yoko Ono's mind music often bridges the categories of both conceptual and aural instruments. Her wordscore TAPE PIECE III, Snow Piece (autumn 1963) reads, in part: "Take a tape of the sound of the snow falling. This should be done in the evening. Do not listen to the tape. Cut it and use it as strings to tie gifts with." It echoes Hakuin: "How I would have them hear/In the woods of Shinoda/At an old temple/When the night is deepening/The sound of the snow-fall!" [9] Similarly, a 1962 word score by Milan Knizak calls for a radio broadcast of a snowstorm. Christian Marclay's more recent The Beatles (1989) is a pillow crocheted from audiotape on which all the Beatles' music has been recorded: a true objet s'nore. The potential state of silence in Marclay's object is not simply an occasion for contemplative tranquility, because at any instant it can become audible and boisterous. In this case, the means of amplification belie the existence of psychotechnics of the type discovered by Penfield's patient. Thus, an object could ostensibly be silent and deafen- ing at the same time, a koan-like state ironically excluded from Cagean aesthetics. 2 Editorial</page><page sequence="3">SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENTS Historically, the line dividing sound from musical sound was drawn at the threshold of signification [10]. The arts somehow overlooked the fact that the worlds of sound are much larger than musical sound-and this includes twentieth-century composition's incorporation, from Russolo onwards, of "extra-musical sound" as a means of reinvigorating music. To truly incorporate sound, of course, would dissolve these bounds of music as they have been historically argued-along with their atten- dant genre principles-and substantiate areas unambiguously outside existing conceptions of music. This already occurs within all daily experience of environments and media and across the liminal thresholds of apperception itself. Yet, to understand these phenomena, to bring them effectively into fields of artistic practice, would require material notions based in poetics and semiosis-not "musical semiotics," but something emanating from a more comprehensive technique of aurality that has yet to be developed. How might this affect instruments? We can consider how it might im- pinge upon something already familiar: the sampler. Where and what exactly is the instrument in this case? The sound of a normal musical instrument is located and limited by the physical materi- als, mechanics and acoustics of the instrument itself. However, the sound of a sampler lies in a me- diated elsewhere or anywhere. Whether the sampled sound is of extinct amphibians or a quiz show host, the location of the sound-and thus, of the instrument-exists in at least two places at once, or modulates between or among two or more locations. The instrument could easily be conceived as the class of sounds the sampler organizes and the way it organizes them; in this respect, the sam- pler is not a new instrument, but is the possibility for an infinity of new instruments. But the design of samplers is too imbued with music: how could the crude segmentation of a piano keyboard give way to a significant design? And there is training: the discipline required to master a significant in- strument may be of the same order as that of a virtuoso sitar or a three-chord guitar in a punk band.
