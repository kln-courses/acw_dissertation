<plain_text><page sequence="1">472 IN DEFENCE OF SHELLEY. In the days of Josias, King of Juda, a divine message came to Jeremias : " Lo, I have set thee this day to root up and pull down?to build and to plant/' The Prophet was sent to free his people from slavery to their own* imaginings, and from the tyranny of fictitious idols they themselves set up. These Jeremias was first to pull down, in order afterwards to substitute the true God of infinite beauty and beneficence, in the place of unreal semblances. To-day this dangerous trick of the human mind, through a false idea to create its own source of unhappiness and even disease, occupies a prominent place in pathological science. A century ago, however, Shelley pointed it out, and devoted himself especially to uproot its baneful influence with regard to the sphere of religion, to which it is, however, by no means confined. HENCE reform has a double aspect and must begin in the destruction of a previous state before renewal can take its place. Shelley was barely 30 years old when he was suddenly taken away from ? his passion of reforming the world.' He perished in the Bay of Spezia, whilst still in his destructive period, before the unfolding of his poetic ideal on its positiv? side had properly begun. In consequence he has left behind him the reputation of a reckless boy, wantonly pulling the world to pieces : but his poetry, so sublime in quality, is sufficient proof that its motive was not Nihilistic, but something constructive. Fortunately he has left us, in the Prometheus Un bound, a masterpiece in which allegorically he explains his poetic theory. But we must first know, to under stand it, something of the circumstances of his time, and of the philosophy and theology, which, creating the atmosphere around his cradle in 1792, alienated him in his schooldays afterwards, as he became more and more absorbed in the Platonism and abstractions of the Greeks. We must reconstruct the surroundings of Shelley's youth under these aspects. Without doing violence to mind and instinct, the thought of a God comes inevitably to u? all : but to</page><page sequence="2">IN DEFENCE OF SHELLEY. 473 elaborate conceptions of unseen Reality reason must either fabricate its own ideal from earth-born images and experience, or by revelation on a divine authority seek eternal Truth through infallible Faith. Professing Christians divide themselves into two primary groups : those who, relying on the witness of Christ in his Church, submit reason to faith, worship a God tran scending all that eye can see and understanding com prehend. Catholic Christianity follows this method. On the other hand, if the pillar and ground of faith be rejected, reason and private judgment, left to their own resources, are liable to create something fictitious, and fall into a slavery of their own making. The gods of Greece and Rome were human conceptions, yet their sway over the nations adopting them was no less abso lute on that account. The application of this rationalistic method to Chris tianity became prominent in Europe from the time of Descartes, 1650. He based human knowledge on sub jective mental states, and not, as previously, on the authority of external witness. Locke, in England, popularised the view and limited Descarte's theory still more. Man, according to him, knows for certain only his own ideas and sentiments. Shelley was born later on, where and when Locke's theory was pre dominant, and Catholic Christianity represented as a monstrous superstition,?the Church of Rome as Baby lon, the mother of all abominations, and the English reform the purest example of genuine Christianity. In addition, from Addison's time (1719) the " Para dise Lost " had acquired an exaggerated ascendancy in England, for its religious teaching, yet Milton's portrayal of the God of Cromwell and his troopers failed to win Shelley's approval, or to correspond with his poetic vision, as his studies opened his mind to other influences. To the " Paradise Lost " Shelley, in his preface to the Prometheus, alludes, and he regards Satan as Milton's hero, whose attitude towards Mil ton's ideal did not shock him. The Prometheus opens somewhat as the poem of Milton, and Jupiter, the</page><page sequence="3">474 THE IRISH MONTHLY. earth-born conception of the Greeks, has this in com mon with Milton's Deity, that Shelley regarded both as products of human reason. Prometheus, however, is no rebel angel like Satan, but, in Shelley's own words, ? the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest motives to the best and noblest ends.' It is he Avhose patient suffering dethrones Jupiter with the help of Demogorgon. Shelley, however, did not live to enthrone the vision he contemplated in the place of the wreckage he had made in his revolt against rationalism and spurious idols. In his early years he eagerly joined anyone in revolt against traditional con ventions of man's selfish making. So in religion his poetic insight instinctively seemed to visualise a spiritual realm, transcending the current beliefs and practice of pious folks around him in the first half of last century, before a clearer light had dawned in England. In the final words of the drama, that outlines the poet's own millennium, after freeing Prometheus from the tyranny of an earth-born deity, wre catch a glimpse of Shelley's ultimate reality : a vision of loveliness and beauty : the reign of wisdom and endurance ; gentleness and virtue, wThen the joys and sorrows of the human race omnipotent Love at last enfolds and consoles beneath its healing wings. His language re calls the touching allusion of a Redeemer, weeping over Jerusalem for souls, enslaved and alienated from the true good. How often, as a hen its chickens, Love had longed to gather them, weary and burdened, under His protection? Throughout allusions to the Gospel are noticeable as forming the basis of Shelley's owrn ideals. Unless, indeed, the constructive element in his poetic theory was very real to him and sublime, it might be difficult to account for the transcendental purity of his lyrical expression. The poet came of a race of Christian heroes devoted to the Catholic tradition. The last prior in England</page><page sequence="4">IN DEFENCE OF SHELLEY. 475 of the Knights of Malta was Sir Robert Shelley, and an EdwTard Shelley suffered for the faith at Tyburn, August 30, 1588 : others of his clan were confessors, who preferred the loss of all things sooner than sur render Faith to reason in religion. The poet, born with unusual insight, and dowered with the love of love, and hate of hate, was himself the blithe spirit?the sky lark he sang of?that from heaven or near it poured forth from his full heart profuse strains of unpreme ditated art : hidden in the light of thought, singing hymns unbidden till the world might be wrought to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not. His translations from Calder?n, shortly before his premature death, show where he was then questing, and how near he was to what he sought, when poring over the Autos Sacramentales of the Spanish poet of the Blessed Sacrament with its Love-symbol. The Autos deal with the Eucharistie mystery under the medium of allegorical characters, enhanced by noblest poetry. They tell of where and what Faith finds con cealed from eyes too blind to see, and ears too deaf to hear what Faith proclaims. Dante, too, was helping Shelley in the same direction, as other translations show. A writer in the Encyclopaedia Britannica thus ably sums up the significance of Shelley's Prometheus : ? " Prometheus Unbound we have no hesitation in calling his masterpiece. Prometheus, the human mind and will, invested with the powers proper to himself?Jupiter, the god of heaven, who thereupon chains and torments Prometheus and oppresses mankind : in other words, the anthropomorphic god of religion is a creation of the human mind, and both the mind of man and man himself are enslaved, as long as this god exercises his delegated, but now absolute power. Prometheus, of old wedded to Asia (Nature), protests against and anathematises the usurper enthroned by himself. At last the anathema takes effect : Eternity, Demogorgon, dismisses Jupiter to unending nothing ness. Prometheus is at once unbound and the mind free : he is re-united to his spouse, Nature, and man passes from degra dation to perfectibility, moral and material." It might be difficult in so few words more clearly to state Shelley's motive or more intelligently to describe</page><page sequence="5">470 THE IRISH MONTHLY. the rationalistic deity and system he anathematised, but it would be misleading to regard the kind of Chris tianity, so treated by Shelley, as the full statement of what Christ taught. He selects the allegory of his poem from a similar habit of the Greeks, who fashioned a mythology after their own ideas, only to be tyrannised over by the very notions they gave omnipotence to. But who, according to Shelley, is the spouse of the human soul? In the concluding stanzas of the Pro metheus, after Jupiter has been cast down, the Love, that ascends the throne of patient powder in the wise heart, closely resembles St. Paul's description of the Spirit, whose fruit is charity, peace, patience and goodness. A final comment remains on something not to be de fended, but to be put away when recalling Shelley as he now enters on his second century. Like the rest of us, he was born into Adam's heritage and fallen state, but all that, with its works and pomps, has long since crumbled into dust. The Shelley we now know has put on the armour of light and cast away the works of darkness. A Platonist in philosophy, body and animal life was for him, like other animals, outside the moral world of his rational soul, a material, evil principle to be discarded and ignored : his spirit ought never to have been united with it at all. Of the dead let the good alone survive, the bad is buried with their bones. The ethics of Plato played him false, yet to some extent his mental aloofness from mere carnal sensuality saved him. Wherein, however, Shelley erred from wiser ways, we make no attempt to excuse him, but as the natural body with its misdeeds is so long dead and entombed, the deathless poet-spirit, who bequeathed to the world such heavenly music, might well be allowed to enter upon his second century on the other side of Lethe?" iniquity forgiven and its sin covered." We are all sinners. Shelley is no exception, and the poetic gift increased his difficulties : but for him, as for us, there is a resurrection?a stepping stone to</page><page sequence="6">IN DEFENCE OF SHELLEY. 4X1 higher things?the dead self! The terrestrial body is sown in corruption, and it shall rise in incorruption : sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory : sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body ! It is our loss that this determined foe of earth-born deities and their spells lived not long enough to define more clearly his own vision of ethereal Beauty. He sought after it so ardently, groping as a child might do in the dark, that upon it with open face he may even now be gazing. Francis Thompson hazarded a timid plea for Shelley's inclusion in the heavenly choir, and we may mercifully look upon both poets, not as they were when under thirty years of age, but as souls purified by pain, who have washed their robes from the sordid stains of the great tribulation. Had Francis Thompson passed away so soon, who now would hold him in esteem? J. D.</page></plain_text>
