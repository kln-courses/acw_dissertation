<plain_text><page sequence="1">Russian Exiles , New Scientific Movements, and Phenomenology: A History of Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France Stefanos Geroulanos In 1929 Edmund Husserl, the "father" of phenomenology, visited Paris for a series of lectures at the Societe Fran?aise de Philosophie. Though much respected in Germany, Husserl was little known in France outside of Stras- bourg.1 These lectures- which became his famous Cartesian Meditations and were the first of his works to be translated into French- were introduced by Pierre Duhem, at the time a major philosopher of science, who used recent developments in mathematics and physics to testify to Husserl's philosophical significance: "[The very evocation of] Hermann Weyl's name, of the homage he pays you . . . when he writes: The precise articulation of these thoughts This essay includes a partial, modified version of the first chapter of my book An Atheism That Is Not Humanist (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2010); the discussion of Gestalt theory and its implications is new.

First, we are accustomed to thinking of phenomenology and philosophy of science as distinct domains of philosophi- cal inquiry, particularly in France. In a passage- as useful for demonstrating the quite different universes set up from the 1940s on by the different philo- sophical trends as it is inexact- that has become famous among partisans of historical epistemology, Michel Foucault pointed out the line that separates a philosophy of experience, of sense, and of subject and a philosophy of knowledge, of rationality, and of concept. . . . one net- work is that of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty; and then another is that of Cavailles, Bachelard, and Canguilhem. In other words, we are dealing with two modal- ities according to which phenomenology was taken up in France, when quite late- around 1930- it finally began to be, if not known, then at least recog- nized. Contemporary philosophy in France began in those years.3 Second, Husserl himself critiqued the claims of modern science and showed little interest in contemporary movements- even those that claimed him as an inspiration. Yet such a division between "modalities according to which phenomenology was taken up in France" was not the case in the 1930s, when phenomenology was "imported" in tandem with new scientific currents and trends in their theorization; moreover, French thinkers largely set aside Hus- serl's (as well as Martin Heidegger's) doubts toward modern science. The introduction of phenomenology in France after the Cartesian Meditations lec- tures was flanked and framed by two parallel receptions of scientific move- ments also imported from France's immediate east: namely, the Copenhagen school of quantum physics, and especially Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which influenced Heidegger's reception, and Gestalt theory, espe- cially Kurt Goldstein's physiology, which influenced Husserl's. At stake in these parallel imports was a series of problems: first, the movement of young thinkers away from the then-dominant figures and trends of French philosophy, such as Henri Bergson and Leon Brunschvicg; sec- ond, the influence of young Russian exile philosophers who had studied in 2.

This article attends to this constellation to argue that the interplay of the paral- lel imports facilitated an antifoundational realism , a revolution in French thought, and introduced the major intellectual developments of the ensuing decades, including philosophical existentialism, French epistemology, and antihumanist anthropology. I first offer a sketch of the network of exiled intel- lectuals around Alexandre Koyre, as this circle and his journal Recherches philosophiques were instrumental in promoting these intellectual develop- ments. I then turn to the early 1930s link developed in the parallel reception of Heidegger's thought and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle by Alexandre Kojeve and Jean Wahl, whose Vers le concret ( Toward the Concrete , 1932) I present as exemplary of what I call antifoundational realism ; finally, I address the mid- and late 1930s (re)joining of Husserl's thought to Gestalt psychology and Goldstein's physiology by Aron Gurwitsch and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Just as the (frequently Russian and/or Jewish) emigres educated in Germany were crucial in facilitating and framing these imports, Wahl and Merleau- Ponty- like Koyre- mattered in that these decidedly French academics became dominant academic figures in philosophy after 1945 and thus in a sense signed the "domestication" of these parallel movements and impulses. Koyre Recherches Philosophiques, and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes By 1935 Paris had become a hub of phenomenological thought, at least as significant as any single German university. Yet of the young philosophers immersed in the 1930s reception of phenomenology, none were established in the Parisian university system; most of them were exiles from Russia, often Jewish, who had left after World War I and the 1917 Revolution. Born mostly between 1895 and 1905, they had studied phenomenology directly or indirectly in Germany and had come to find French neocriticism (i.e., neo-Kantian thought in France) philosophically, if not also scientifically, obsolete.4 Among 4.

W. F. Hegel), and Aron Gurwitsch (also Lithuanian and Jewish, a major advocate of the link between Husserl's thought and Gestalt theory), all of whom produced significant bodies of work on phenomenology. Other foreigners in Paris- Rachel Bespaloff, Bernhard Groethuysen, Vladi- mir Jankelevitch, Pierre Klossowski, Kuki Shuzo, Eric Weil- also contributed to this trend,7 as did many French thinkers who, for the time being, taught either outside Paris (e.g., Wahl until 1936) or at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (Gaston Bachelard). Still others, like Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Raymond Aron (all of them teaching at lycees outside Paris at the time), came to phenomenology through trips to Germany and through Recherches philosophiques and the group around Koyre. As foreigners and exiles, not only did many of these thinkers enjoy a heightened personal aura, but their education clashed with the priorities of French philosophy and provided an alternative to the more traditional French resolutions of philosophical problems. If this network had a center, it was Koyre. Best known now for his work on the history and philosophy of science (especially his influential 1956 lectures at Johns Hopkins University, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe ),8 Koyre had first studied problems of mathematics, partly under Husserl, and had around 1920 turned to the his- tory of religious thought, publishing books on Saint Anselm, Jakob Bohme, and (his decisive early book) Rene Descartes and scholasticism, as well as lectures and essays on, among others, Bohme, John Calvin, Hegel, Nicolas of Cusa, Paracelsus, Caspar Schwenckfeld, and Valentin Weigel.

In an environment famous for its strict- if not downright stifling- pathways to phil- osophical teaching (entry into the Ecole Normale Superieure, and also the agregation ), these thinkers carved out a place in the official academy, notably through two institutions. The first was the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, where Koyre taught and invited younger philosophers (notably Kojeve and Weil) to replace him when he was away (many others participated in their seminars). The second was the journal Recherches philosophiques , founded by Koyre, Henri-Charles Puech, and Albert Spaier, and later coedited also by Wahl and Bachelard; the journal published essays by most of these philoso- phers and was certainly one of phenomenology's most visible advocates. It is as his advisees, as his friends, as essay authors for Recherches philosophiques , and as substitute instructors for his place at the Ecole Pratique that these young, emigre philosophers brought phenomenology and through it granted lasting philosophical relevance to Gestalt theory and quantum physics. Indeed, they coupled phenomenology with quantum physics or Gestalt psychology or both to an astonishing degree; thanks to these parallel couplings, phenomenology acquired epistemological, ontological, and especially institutional force and surpassed the "mandarin" neocritical and spiritualist trends and related tradi- tions that dominated the French university. Realism at the Dusk of Modern Science: Phenomenology and Quanta in Paris In the early 1930s phenomenological and epistemological arguments directed against scientific positivism and neocriticism worked to undo man's standing as privileged observer of nature and causality, and helped overturn the classical transcendental juxtaposition of subject to object. This led to antifoundational 9. Martin Heidegger, "Qu'est-ce que la metaphysique?," trans. Henri Corbin, Bifur, June 10, 1931, 8-27; Heidegger, "De la nature de la cause," trans. A.

Crucial to the early develop- ment of antifoundational realism were phenomenology and the Copenhagen school of quantum physics. The fundamentally epistemological novelty of these two movements and their force in philosophical treatments of realism were felt throughout the early 1930s, most visibly in works on the history and philosophy of science by Koyre and Bachelard, most importantly in Wahl's and Kojeve's turn to a new realism. What is interesting and new here is the complementarity of quantum physics and phenomenology, which forms the ground of antifoundational realism. Quantum Physics as an Overcoming of the Old Rationalism-Realism Debate The perception that the relationship between philosophy and science had bro- ken down in the mid- to late nineteenth century was a problem widely consid- ered already from the late 1910s, one that led to vigorous debate on the priority of each of the two over the other. Most contemporary philosophers by and large worked out this "breakdown" into a debate between rationalism (allied to neocriticism and the claim that science proceeds from the reasoning human mind and encompasses the world as it may be understood) and realism (here claiming that science seeks to comprehend a grand world external to man and proceeds from the data provided by this world). With its 1931-32 issue Recher- ches philosophiques signaled the need to reconsider such categories in light of new scientific findings. The rise of quantum physics from Max Planck and Albert Einstein to Louis de Broglie and Heisenberg (received seriously by philosophical milieus in Paris in the late 1920s) accentuated and singularized this debate.11 As the French reception of quanta developed, philosophical reactions diverged. Certain thinkers, like Brunschvicg and the scientist-philosopher Paul Langevin, rejected the radical claims and implications of the Copenhagen interpretation of quanta, implying (with Einstein) that the antideterminist uni- verse was but a soon-to-be-corrected aberration. In the philosophical and epis- 1 1 . Suffice it to add here that during 1929 alone, several series of lectures on quanta were given in Paris by no less than Paul Langevin, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Louis de Broglie, but also by Hendrik Kramers and Enrico Fermi.

That is, there is an irresolvable contradiction between the wave and particle images that the atom provides the physicist.16 To 12. The question of indeterminisme (uncertainty) may here be seen specifically against the back- ground of a resistance to scientific determinism elaborated in French sociology since the late nine- teenth century, and perhaps still more important, the legacy of spiritualism and the influence of Bergson's objections to science. 13.

But for Bachelard, Kojeve, Koyre, and other younger con- temporaries, the philosophical novelty of quanta rested with the uncertainty principle and its development beyond the claims of complementarity. Uncer- tainty holds that in the study of electrons, the physicist cannot simultaneously determine both their location and speed but will necessarily err on one or the other of these computations. To locate and gauge the moving electron the phys- icist needs to shoot photons at it, photons whose energy necessarily affects its movement and speed ( NES , 122/122). Consequently, the observer-physicist becomes involved in the experiment but also becomes incapable of predicting what the electron under observation will do next with this newly acquired energy. The result of this is that the determinist foundation of post-Newtonian physics- that such a movement must be fully observable- can no longer be sustained. By extension, as the observer's participation cannot be disengaged from the system under observation, and as the very process of observation relies on the interaction between observer and world, the Cartesian and mod- ern construction of nature and space is wrong to postulate the thinking, cal- culating observer (and his or her tools of study) as strictly independent and separable from the objects and world of his or her study. That is, any positive knowledge of nature necessitates the observer's fundamental interaction with nature itself. The scientistic and positivist hopes that nature would one day become fully transparent to the human mind suddenly ran aground on a major problem behind this transparency: transcendent observers cannot understand a pure nature distinct from themselves, and no intellectual process can deter- mine what lies beyond the observer's reach.17 Both Bachelard and Kojeve reacted to the uncertainty principle with much excitement. Bachelard's call for a new realism is limited by his lack of Unknowable: Modern Science , Nonclassical Theory, and the " Two Cultures" (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2002) and Reading Bohr: Physics and Philosophy (Dordrecht: Springer, 2007). 17. Henri Atlan, citing J.-M. Levy-Leblond, explains that part ol the torce ot quantum physics, also for the major physicists working on questions they posed, was precisely that "when quantum concepts were first elaborated their fathers could understand them only by reference to classical concepts, even those they were meant to replace" ( Enlightenment to Enlightenment: Intercritique of Science and Myth, trans. Lenn J. Schramm [Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993], 250). Kojeve, Bachelard, and Wahl echo this point and expand philosophically on it as well. For an evocation of precisely this capacity to destabilize classical systems, see Jean-Fra^ois Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition , trans. Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984), 55. This prioritization of quantum physics persists and is one of its main popular claims.

In Kojeve's Lidee du determinisme , the connection of science (and the philoso- phy underlying it) to phenomenology, and this connection's anthropological potential, are far clearer: while quantum physics provides the impetus (thereby straining his own neo-Kantian education), phenomenology provides an engine for the philosophical effects of quanta. Bachelard's Le nouvel esprit scientifique extended his late 1920s efforts to refute science as an objective and unified conception of reality as a world purely independent of the mind and reconstructed in terms of an oblique correspondence between the rational and the real. Having already suggested that Einstein's theory of relativity indicated a "collapse" of the Kantian nou- menon , Bachelard here extended this interpretation to non-Euclidean geome- try, Reichenbachian indeterminism, and, above all, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.18 Bachelard specified that the Copenhagen interpretation of quan- tum physics (whose arrival "has put everything in question again" [ NES , 122/122; translation mine]) imposed a conception of science that overcame "elementary" realism (NES, 130/130), and that suggested the possibility of reconciling rationalism to realism and overcoming the meaning and conse- quences of the clash between them (NES, 130/130). "Physics has no doubt maintained, in its language at any rate, a more or less realistic flavor, but is it indeed true that this obscure residue of realism actually lends weight to the concepts of physics and influences the goals of research?" (NES, 131/131). For Bachelard, this did not mean that science could just do away with reality. Instead, the thinking on which science and its advances were grounded had to be cleaned of Cartesian domination: "the partiality in favor of subjective experience" and its consequence, the "progressive objectification" of the world (NES, 169/167). For Bachelard (as for Koyre), this effectively implied the end of the classical, antiempiricist mathematization of nature that was characteristic of modern science (NES, 161-62, 166 / 161, 164-65).19 And, 18. This argument is most clearly made in NES , 16/16-17. Bachelard's La valeur inductive de la relativite (Paris: Vrin, 1929) received a glowing review by Albert Spaier in the same first volume of Recherches ph'losophiques' "II y a la de quoi troubler tout homme habitue a penser qu'une solution de continuite existe toujours entre les verites a priori et les faits" (There is something there [in Bachelard's book] to unsettle everyone who is used to thinking that there is always a single continuous solution between a priori truths and the facts) (Recherches philosophiques 1 [1931-32]: 368). Kojeve also sug- gests a filiation between non-Euclidean geometry and "modern" (quantum) physics (ID, 302). 19. See also Koyre's essays "Galilee et Platon" (1943) and "Galilee et la revolution scientifique" (1955), in Etudes d'histoire de la pensee scientifique (Paris: Gallimard, 1973), 170, 193, 199. Bachelard objects not to a mathematization of nature but to an antiempiricist, idealist such operation.</page><page sequence="10">98 Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France given this much, scientists could now imagine a realism of an entirely differ- ent order- one limited to the possible actualizations of their thought ("the realization of the rational" [ /VÂ£S,4-5 , 13/4, 13]). Coextensive to this argument was, as mentioned already, the abandoning of the Kantian thing-in-itself for an entirely other kind of noumenon: "The 'reality' to which this realism cor- responds is not transferred into the realm of the unknowable thing-in-itself. It has a noumenal richness of quite another order. The thing-in-itself is a noumenon by exclusion of phenomena, whereas scientific reality, I would argue, consists in a noumenal context suitable for defining axes of experimen- tation" ( NES , 5/5-6).20 Real according to this definition is what, in the world, is possible to prove, acknowledge, acquiesce to, experiment on. This is a total- ity largely distinct from the intentionality of the individual or scientific mind but nevertheless one that the individual still encounters and interacts with- the reality limited to possible actualizations of thought. The contrast Bache- lard makes is not between phenomena and noumena but between a mind and a world that could be called "real" only by way of a limited contrast to the mind's perception and interpretation of it. This reality "is thus reason confirmed"- in other words, what is available. Still, it is difficult to avoid a sense that while Bachelard provides a new contrast, he does not really step beyond a certain rationalism. "Reason confirmed": such a reality is not, strictly speaking, indeterminable from the scientist's viewpoint. Similarly, "the real- ization of the rational" receives no better or more elaborate definition than that "science conjures up a world, by means not of magic immanent in reality but of rational impulse immanent in mind Scientific work makes rational enti- ties real, in the full sense of the word" (NES, 13/13). Even if we grant Bachelard's unwillingness to work in primarily philosophical terms (and his critique of epistemologists like Meyerson for departing from strictly scientific language), his use of philosophical terms (such as noumenon) leaves these subdued to a rather hasty scientific explanation. For Bachelard, reducing the world to phe- nomena "with a noumenal richness of their own" highlights the contrast of mind and world and limits this "world" to what the mind can relate to, but does not quite break out of this reduction to scientific immanence to consider the forms and limitations of man's engagements. Bachelard's hesitation to orga- nize the philosophical terms of his approach to quantum physics limits the novelty of his interpretation. 20. Bachelard made the same argument on the need for a new conception of the noumenon in "Noumene et metaphysique," Recherches philosophiques 1 (1931-32): 55-65, repr. in Etudes (1970), ed. Georges Canguilhem (Paris: Vrin, 2000).</page><page sequence="11">Stefanos Geroulanos 99 Even more than in Bachelard's work, quantum physics played a central role in the philosophical formation of the then twenty-eight-year-old Kojeve. Kojeve had escaped the USSR and studied in Berlin and Heidelberg under neo-Kantian thinkers and Karl Jaspers, arrived in 1926 in Paris, and studied Weyl, Georg Cantor, and de Broglie extensively. Kojeve lauded the Copenha- gen interpretation for overturning Newtonian determinism and therefore trans- forming the conception of the physical world from a "determinist" into a "sta- tistical" one.21 Extending this argument in L'idee du determinisme (his second PhD thesis, directed by Koyre),22 he opposed to the realism of classical physics the far more complex "realism" that follows from Heisenberg's uncertainty. In modern physics, we must distinguish between two kinds of realism that coincided in classical physics, which did not distinguish sufficiently between gnoseological, mathematical, physical and biological subjects and, conse- quently, the worlds that are attached to them. First, metaphysical realism, which considers the physical world as a sui generis reality, independent from the gnoseological and psychological subjects. Then, the properly physical real- ism, which opposes, inside this world, the subject to the object [for him, the observing and observed systems, respectively, as suggested by Heisenberg- SG]- both of which are real in relation to each other and situated on the same ontological plane. (ID, 286) The interaction of observing and observed systems in the milieu of a world is central to Kojeve's argument, because it reconfigures the philosophical con- ception of the subject-object relationship. If classical physics was fundamen- tally realist (ID, 278), then modern physics contradistinguished the reality of the observing system from that of the observed, basically showing that there is no such thing as a pure, external reality, that the Kantian in-itself was no philosophical given but an irrelevant metaphysical fantasy ( ID , 283).23 Kojeve distinguishes between physical and philosophical subjects thus: Modern physics [is not] any more "idealist," more "subjectivist," more "phenomenalist" in the positivist sense than classical physics was.

Kojeve submitted L'idee du determinisme to the Sorbonne, where it was accepted in 1932.

On the other hand, the totality formed by the two interact- ing systems is certainly real and "objective," in the sense that it exists inde- pendently as much of the empirical subject (the experimenter in the flesh) as from the gnoseological "knowing subject." (ID, 283; italics mine) If he restricts his attention to the relation between observing and observed sys- tems, Kojeve finds them equally real and ontologically independent from each other. He seeks, moreover, to separate this "whole" constructed by the inter- action of the two systems from experience in general, insofar as he refuses to efface the independence of the observed system from the empirical subject. Yet this distinction does not (here or in the earlier passage) cast doubt on the far- reaching significance of this new realism; instead, it allows the physical realism to be "real and 'objective'" and thus (1) amplifies the independence of the being of the observed system from the observing system and the epistemological and empirical subject, but nevertheless (2) does not deny that the epistemological and empirical subject is itself dependent to a degree on the observed system (given that the observing system is part of the empirical subject and the interac- tion of the observing/observed systems is real). In other words, the observed system is ontologically distinct from the observing one; both are real and irre- ducible to each other; the relation between their realities is irreducible.24 The contrast between the observing and observed systems has fundamen- tal implications for philosophical knowledge and subjectivity (both in a physi- cal and in a metaphysical sense),25 because it raises the possibility of new differ- ences between subject and world, and, in the philosophical context, of separate and complementary ontologies: an ontological dualism based on one anthropo- logical ontology and a separate one for the world and the things experienced by man. Kojeve, accordingly, criticized the ontological monism and mind-reality contrast of most modern philosophers, arguing that their opposition between 24. A related parallel to Kojeve's conception of quantum physics, which I do not discuss here, is his contemporary interpretation of Wassily Kandinsky, with whom Kojeve had an extensive corre- spondence and on whom he wrote twice. The connection is made in somewhat biographical terms in Dominique Auffret, Alexandre Kojeve (Paris: Grasset, 1990), 272-92. 25. Like Meyerson and Bachelard, Kojeve distinguishes the two. The relationship between physics and mathematics (particularly the significance of geometry) is typical of the French neo- Kantian tradition and a considerable theme in Brunschvicg's aforementioned L'experience humaine et la causalite physique , not to mention Husserl's Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcen- dental Phenomenology (1935) (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1970). This played a paramount role in Koyre's theorization of the beginnings of modern science. For the role of physics in Kojeve's later concept of "energology," see Alexandre Kojeve, Essai d'une histoire raisonnee de la philosophie pai'enne, vol. 1 (Paris: Gallimard, 1997), 304.</page><page sequence="13">Stefanos Geroulanos 101 subject and object was simplistic and too radical and that how the subject "knows" the object was even more troubling. He effectively discarded Husserl's "Parisian lectures"- the Cartesian Meditations- as obsolete and symptomatic of how knowledge and the epistemological subject are treated by "die ganze abendlandische Philosophie" (the whole of Western philosophy);26 chided Brunschvicg for not realizing that science had changed dramatically since the turn of the century;27 and elaborately opposed any inclusion of electron mechan- ics or Einstein's relativity in the new, "modern" science (ID, 33-34). Still, Kojeve did leave a way out of this philosophical failure. In his writing, Kojeve offered a parallel epistemological-cum-ontological attempt to substantiate and explain the new realism of quantum physics with Heidegger's treatment of Dasein and his rethinking of world and reality. In Heideggerian phenomenology Kojeve found the possibility of interpreting the successes and limitations of physics, allowing a fusion of the two to provide a significant philosophical critique of the limitations of each. While Bachelard lacked a properly philosophical language to allow him to speak for the philosophical implications of quanta, Kojeve used phenomenology as such a language. Wahl drew more or less the same conclu- sions from atomic physics, whose testimony to science's recognition of its limits he appreciated: a call to a new philosophical realism, a legitimation of phenom- enological treatments of knowledge, and a revelation of the limits of subjec- tive knowledge (and, by extension, of consciousness).28 But for now, to clarify Kojeve's parallel between phenomenology and physics, to explicate Bachelard's claims to a "realization of the real," and to prepare for Wahl's own "realism," I turn to discuss the early 1930s import of Heideggerian phenomenology and its argument for a world without external independent reality.

While they did read him in a fashion that could be regarded today as anthropological, they also used Sein und Zeit C Being and Time) to ruin the anthropological argumentation of the "old guard." The often-repeated reproach that his French readers reduced his fundamental ontology to an anthropology not only forgets that this interpretation was initi- ated and used by Heidegger himself on strategically valuable occasions, but also ignores the toppling of philosophical anthropology from its neo-Kantian peak to the atheist realism under discussion here. Concerned with occasional German critiques of his early work as anthropocentric, or as buried under the shadow of Max Scheler, Husserl, or even Jaspers,29 Heidegger claimed that his readers were themselves being anthropological on three occasions specifically designed to press a strict reading of his work and a disciple-like following. In a 1937 letter to Wahl, he criticized the latter 's presentation of Being and Time as an Existenzphilosophie (existentialism) that bordered on anthropology.30 His famous 1946 "Letter on Humanism" to Jean Beaufret also emphasized the perils of a humanist and hence anthropologist reading of his work.31 Finally, in a letter to Hannah Arendt, Heidegger specifically criticized Kojeve for being limited to anthropology, in the same paragraph in which he praised Kojeve's Hegel lectures as the zenith of French thought.32 The argument has been per- petuated by philosophers invested in projects related to the limits of man (e.g., Jacques Derrida) in identifying a certain Heideggerian orthodoxy (e.g., Beau- fret, Luc Ferry, and Alain Renaut) so as to distinguish themselves either in it 29. See his note in "On the Essence of Ground" (hereafter cited as EG), where Heidegger writes that Sein und Zeit was misunderstood in Germany as being bound to an anthropocentric perspec- tive (in Martin Heidegger, Pathmarks, ed. William McNeill [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997], 371n66). This expressly concerns his debate with Ernst Cassirer, who (somewhat like Brunschvicg, who saw humanity as his own ideal) emphasized the priority of anthropology, as well as the recurrent comparisons with Scheler. See also some of the more recent interpretations of his work, e.g., Fran^oise Dastur, Heidegger et la question anthropologique (Louvain: Editions de l'lnstitut Superieur de Philosophic, 2003), whose second chapter presents the Heideggerian reading of Kant (central to his early post- 1927 years) as specifically seeking a philosophical anthropology and the relation of such anthropology to the problem of finitude. 30.

As exiles, foreigners, and travelers helped bring phenomenology to intellectuals both in and outside the academic establishment in France, the status accorded to Husserl and Heideg- ger was that of providing a step beyond Bergson and the neo-Kantians, intro- ducing a different form of philosophy that connected ontology to epistemology in a way that was sensitive to both the philosophical and the scientific limita- tions of Bergsonism and neocriticism.35 This first tradition of readers never accepted Heidegger's thought as marking the limits of their philosophical horizon but instead considered it a ground for their thought and also a kind of evolving argument they could engage with in dialogue, that is, whose ends and arguments could be furthered or criticized. What Heidegger offered them was 33. Tom Rockmore, Heidegger and French Philosophy: Humanism, Antihumanism, and Being (London: Routledge, 1995), 38; Dominique Janicaud, Heidegger en France , 2 vols. (Paris: Michel, 2001), 1: chaps. 4-5 (cf. chap. 2). Ethan Kleinberg also contrasts the "first," anthropological reading of the 1930s to the second and third, postwar and nonanthropological readings {Generation Existen- tial , 10-11, 17). Anson Rabinbach also implies this in In the Shadow of Catastrophe: German Intel- lectuals between Apocalypse and Enlightenment (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), 120-21. 34. Corbin's term, while indeed a poor substitute for Being-there , is not necessarily a bad transla- tion of Dasein in the essay "What Is Metaphysics?" and reflects Heidegger's specifically metaphysi- cal argument, as well as providing a realist interpretation of the definition of the human. As Corbin noted, Heidegger approved the term during a discussion in 1937, and it is possible that this evasion of questions of existence and the ambiguity of "human reality" are precisely what factored in its favor. Whether realite humaine involves an anthropologization of Heidegger, it inversely serves in the French context as an emptying out of anthropological categories: rejecting that human reality is any- thing other than the there-ness of Dasein. Heidegger's Dasein and Kojeve's repeated use of realite humaine in his lectures on Hegel in different ways postulate a being that elides and undermines anthropological determination; in Kojeve's case, the identification of realite humaine with nothing- ness is explicit and fundamental. Critiques, like Janicaud's and Derrida's, do apply more closely to Sartre's overuse of realite humaine in Being and Nothingness (New York: Philosophical Library, 1956); Corbin's use of realite humaine in his translation of passages from Being and Time is also more suspect than his use for "Qu'est-ce que la metaphysique?," where its utility is much clearer. 35.

Conversely, the methodological transformation of the philosophy of sci- ence already suggested above paved the way for the import and philosophical legitimation of phenomenology, primarily Heidegger's and Husserl's but also (a case that is less known) Scheler's.36 Specifically with regard to Bachelard's v attempt to reconstruct conceptions of the noumenon and Wahl's search for a concrete basis of existence, Heidegger's phenomenology provided a new way to conceive the meaning and limitations of noumena as Bachelard had called for, and (the lack of) a foundation to human existence.37 Like Gurvitch, who wrote the first text in French on Heidegger in 1930, Wahl, Levinas, Koyre, and Kojeve all emphasized his phenomenological and existential systematization of man's comportment in the world,38 which they then used in further projects. Besides the antifoundational realist critique of philosophical and scientific Cartesianism and idealism, they facilitated, for example, a basically atheistic interplay between a threatened (Kierkegaardian) subjectivity and a totalizing world from which they could not escape and which they could not understand (a point that extends to Hegel's notion of historical totality). In this context, rather than use Heidegger to anthropologize phenomenology, the reading of Heidegger by French philosophers permitted a dethroning and emptying out of existing anthropology and a denigration of man from his earlier status of an ideal. Kojeve's reading of Heidegger highlights many of the above points in Heidegger's thought by tying them explicitly to his reading of Heisenberg. Already in 1929 Kojeve had written that philosophers from Descartes to Hus- 36.

Rather, subsuming the ontological differ- ence in Dasein , he contrasts Dasein (etre-la) to Vorhandensein (&lt; etre-donne ) in its totality and interprets the latter as nature , as Hegel's for-itself42 as world in Heidegger's "On the Essence of Ground"- the world that is not but that "worlds" (EG, 126)- or also simply as "the world that is given me." Kojeve appropriates these in his own term le donne (the given), Man's "sphere of action."43 In his attempt to see le donne as ontologically significant, Kojeve uses Vorhandensein instead of Heidegger's own term, Vorhandenheit (for Heidegger, worldly objects do not "have" Being). Kojeve writes: "The novelty is the resolute acceptance of ontological dualism , of the essential and irre- ducibly ontological difference between the human being [Dasein] and natural being [VorhandenseinT (NHH, 37). Kojeve identifies Heidegger's Dasein with Heisenberg's observing system, and Vorhandensein with the observed system. Consider the following two quotes (the first of which I have already cited and repeat here for emphasis): Modern physics [is not] any more "idealist," more "subjectivist," more "phe- nomenalist" in the positivist sense than classical physics was the observed system is no less real than the observing system, and it is independent from the latter as regards its being ; their interaction is itself also real.

The world [Welt] of man differs from nature [. Natur ; Vorhan- densein] in an essential way, by the fact that it is modified- or, at least, as revealed and considered to be modifiable. (NHH, 37) In and by these parallels, Kojeve clearly echoes Heidegger's discussion of the worldhood of the world and his suspension of the "existence" of any objective reality distinct from Dasein' s world ( BT ' sees. 14-18, 43; EG, 368nl7). For Heidegger, the world is bound up with the understanding (ontological or preon- tological) through which Dasein discloses it: "The question of whether there is a world at all and whether its Being can be proved, makes no sense if it is raised by Dasein as being-in-the-world; and who else would raise it?" (. BT ' sec. 43a: 202/246-47). For Heidegger, When Dasein does not exist, "independence" "is" not either, nor "is" the "in-itself." In such a case this sort of thing can be neither understood nor not understood. In such a case even entities within the world can neither be discovered nor lie hidden. In such a case it cannot be said that entities are, nor can it be said that they are not. But now , as long as there is an under- standing of Being and therefore an understanding of presence-at-hand, it can indeed be said that in this case entities will still continue to be. (BT, sec. 43c: 212/255) In rejecting classical realism and the skeptical question, Heidegger empha- sizes that (1) everything that is or can be real for Dasein is already part of its world ("Even the Real can be discovered only on the basis of a world which has already been disclosed" [BT, sec. 43a: 203/247]) and (2) the reality of Dasein , of the world, and of entities that Dasein encounters and interprets in the world is never in question but is, once again, disclosed by Dasein' s under- standing of Being and its comportment as/through care. Along with Dasein as Being-in-the-World, entities within-the-world have in each case already been disclosed. This existential-ontological assertion seems to accord with the thesis of realism that the external world is Really present-at-hand. Insofar as this existential assertion does not deny that enti- ties within-the-world are present-at-hand, it agrees . . . with the thesis of real- ism in its results. But it differs in principle from every kind of realism; for realism holds that the Reality of the "world" not only needs to be proved but also is capable of proof. In the existential assertion both of these positions are directly negated. But what distinguishes this assertion from realism alto- gether is the fact that in realism there is a lack of ontological understanding.</page><page sequence="19">Stefanos Geroulanos 107 Indeed realism tries to explain Reality ontically by Real connections of inter- action between things that are real. (. BT ' sec. 43a: 207/251) Like Koyre and Wahl (who understood these arguments as denials of man's capacity ever to come to terms with his world or to understand it fully), Kojeve accepts this position; he writes that "the world of man differs from nature in an essential way" and underlines that the sheer presence of a Befindlichkeit trans- forms nature into world (NHH, 37-39).44 What this means, for Kojeve, is that the existence of man transforms something like nature qua pure exteriority into a given world that man always finds himself in interaction with and continually transforms. If such a nature exists, it does so only in the absence of man; given Man's presence in and interactions in it, such an imaginary nature is immedi- ately turned into a world or reality that Man operates in and with, and no longer holds anything in itself. This is his realism: "Whoever says 'Realism,' says ontological dualism" (ILH, 432). Contesting, like Bachelard (NES, 130, 176-77 / 130-31, 174-75), "the metaphysical realism that considers the world as a sui generis reality," Kojeve de facto defends Heidegger's own kind of "realism" in his construction of this dual reality of observing/observed systems (ID, 323). A sui generis reality that cannot be interpreted and thereby changed is a meta- physical fantasy, but a reality constituted through and by man's interaction with objects allows, for Kojeve, a nonmetaphysical, properly ontological conception that corresponds with post-Heisenbergian science. Against Heidegger, who denied science's capacity to reveal Being, Kojeve was particularly concerned with showing that the reality of the world, of a Sein des Vorhandenen , is vali- dated and shown in the theoretical construction underlying uncertainty's and complementarity's treatment of an observed system, an electron. Kojeve, accordingly, insists that contemporary physics finds itself on the same level as the phenomenological understanding of the world's reality- and they both stand in contrast to the Cartesian foundations of modern theories of knowledge and truth that he criticized. If up to this point in modern thought, this thinking subject set itself to revealing the truths contained in a spatiodimensional nature (whether these truths and this nature were in fact merely in the subject's mind or in an external reality), the realism that Heidegger and Kojeve promulgate thinks of the subject as involved and reliant on the object of his or her study, an object constructing and limiting the subject's own involvement with it, and a world inconceivable in any strict distinction from this subject. 44. By Befindlichkeit I mean, and I take Kojeve to mean, existential disposition: the subject's existence as always already an engagement with things around it.</page><page sequence="20">108 Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France Thus, in Kojeve's writing, the availability of phenomenological and onto- logical language provided a philosophical basis for such a realism without undermining what he considered the properly scientific import and signifi- cance of quanta.45 What I am interested in here is how this interpretation of realism, as a balance of phenomenological and scientific problems evoked by Kojeve (and Bachelard), was furthered by contemporaries, particularly Wahl. As Wahl pointed out later in his books Poesie pensee perception (1947) and The Philosopher's Way (1948), the terms of realism changed with the arrival of quantum physics and Heideggerian thought in the late 1920s. It is not possible that a disruption as radical as the one we have been experi- encing would not be accompanied by a reshuffling of forms of thought. . . . Einstein, Planck, Bohr, Heisenberg have destroyed the original conceptions of causality, space, and time to tell the truth, the frames have been shat- tered; there are no more frames. And the things that were in the frames have also been shattered, and the links (causality, substance) between them as well.46 After Planck, Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Heisenberg, "the problem is to see not only how science is possible, but how it is that science cannot go beyond certain limits" (PW, 206). Similarly, "the realism of Heidegger, if we can call his philosophy realism (and he would question such a determination), is tinged with his idea of 'being in the world.' Here we no longer find the classical dis- tinction between subject and object" (PW, 209). Aiming, in his own critique of metaphysics, at a new realism, Wahl further suggested (again in accord with Kojeve [ID, 245; NHH, 39-40]) that quantum physics and Heideggerian phenomenology share an opposition to anthropocentrism and anthropomor- phism in science and philosophy (PW, 207, 320); for Wahl, in their different ways, these "movements" reawakened the problems of liberty and human understanding. These are the questions Wahl set for himself and for modern thought in his 1932 work Vers le concret. To the Concrete! Wahl and Antifoundational Realism As a philosophical manifesto, the introduction to Vers le concret is rather strange. It clearly aims to demonstrate the insufficiency of "the idealism and 45.

At stake here is the "concreteness" hidden in experience, and the immediacy through which we sense it. Yet this novelty of the book itself is coated in the polite and very classical rhetoric of an account of certain recent developments in philosophy, indicating a conciliatory tone and a ter- minology almost seeking to convert philosophers of the 1920s. This inclusive tendency is nowhere clearer than in the mixture of phenomenological with classical philosophical terminology through which Wahl disrupts and abuses the terms of classical dualities: the thinkers he discusses, Gabriel Marcel, Wil- liam James, and Alfred North Whitehead, are thus philosophers of transcen- dence and immanence, "panpsychism" and "panmaterialism," idealists and realists- yet, strictly speaking, they subscribe to none of these terms. We are thus faced with a double gesture: (1) an attempt to exceed and reground con- temporary philosophy through this new "concrete"- to demonstrate the deriv- ative and insufficient character of transcendental idealism and its incarnation in neocriticism- and (2) a recuperative move that mutes the novelty of prag- matism, Marcel's protoexistentialism, and Whitehead's discussions of spatial- ity so as to make them easily recognizable to the uninitiated- indeed, to give the impression that these philosophers simply offer almost expected corrective alternatives. The ambiguity of this language, as well as of the contrast between the radical goals and the rhetorical continuity with modern thought, makes it a rather difficult task to sketch the foundations of- in fact, makes it a realism that appears largely inexact from the perspective of those thinkers read through its lens as contributing to it. What does this new movement, this hesitant new anti-idealism, amount to?49 On this question, Wahl is precise and far-reaching. He denies any existence 47.

Like most modern realists, Wahl distinguishes between two sorts of realism, a naive one and a properly philosophical one (VC, 6-7). The par- ticularity of his distinction lies with his rejection of those realisms for which the interaction between subject and world is contingent and for which all real- ity lies in the world- such as classical materialisms- or a substantialist reality a la David Hume or John Stuart Mill that the subject cannot fully experience ( VC, 7). Instead, his approach to the concrete begins with, and is enveloped in, this very interaction of human to world; in constructing a philosophical back- ground that shows at once the novelty, the common traits, and the singular aspects of Marcel, James,- and Whitehead, Wahl links here a reading of Hei- degger with a specific skepticism toward modern science. Phenomenology and quantum physics are not elaborately treated as Wahl's targets in this text, but they offer a privileged mode of entry into his subject. Wahl presents Heidegger only in footnotes and citations but addresses him as indispensable for the trends and force of contemporary thought.50 He then evades both Heidegger's ontological focus and his organization of anthro- pological and existential problems in the construction of Dasein ( BT ' div. 1, pt. 2). In an analysis remarkable for its positioning of Heidegger's thought, Wahl writes: We will often come to refer to Heidegger. He has been profoundly conscious of many of the aspirations of contemporary thought; his clear consciousness of this obscure ground [fond] is joined by his remarkable art of translating in abstract terms his own observations and those of his predecessors- whether these be Kierkegaard, pragmatism, Dilthey or Spengler. ... he has tried to join to the sentiment of individual existence, such as Kierkegaard had sensed it, the sentiment of our existence in the midst [milieu] of things, as this dawns today in philosophy. (VC, 3n-4n) Wahl's analysis proceeds from the last of these points: "the sentiment of our existence in the midst of things, as this dawns today in philosophy" (VC, 4n). 50.

If Heidegger weaves together the aspirations of modern thought, this is because of how he establishes the prob- lems of world and of being in the world, and how he interprets the enchain- ment of the Dasein among and by the things the self encounters as resisting it in the world. The immediacy and enchainment characteristic of this encounter between subject and world are a critique of both Hegel and substantialist dual- isms, including that of the distinction between subject and object as deter- mined from Descartes to Husserl. For Wahl, the subject finds itself in the world, not in opposition to it; there is no unavailable and absolutely other, any in-itself (as in Kant) in what the subject encounters. And though the sub- ject does not find itself alone before a worldly object simply, directly, and com- pletely comprehensible, the encounter between the two is more or less imme- diate, in the sense that, out of habit, experience, or some other condition, the human subject copes in the world and comports itself toward an object with- out having to do something consciously, without effort, and without having to overcome a certain radical separation. Thanks to this emphasis, Wahl is perhaps the first among Heidegger's early readers to emphasize a link between his thought and pragmatism:51 even in its immensity and density, the world as conceived by Heidegger is more or less familiar to the subject that it exceeds; it presents itself above all on occa- sions when it "resists" the subject, at moments when, by producing obstacles, it becomes a philosophical or existential problem. Here Wahl echoes implicitly the difference of Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit in Heidegger's Being and Time and refers explicitly to how Heidegger presents the subject as thrown in the midst of an immanent world and, through this immanence, puts the subject in indirect rapport with the object (VC, 11). From this notion of resistance, Wahl posits man as having only an imperfect understanding of this world, forced to a receptivity and a participative relation vis-a-vis the world; the world 51. The problem of pragmatism is central to Wahl's early writings. See Jean Wahl, Les philoso- phies pluralistes d'Angleterre et d'Amerique (Paris: Alcan, 1920), translated by Fred Rothwell as The Pluralist Philosophies of England and America (London: Open Court, 1925).</page><page sequence="24">112 Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France itself in this sense comes to appear, from the perspective of man, as immense and enchaining. Wahl accentuates the immediate, spatial, and immanent characters of the reality that man finds himself in and seeks to explicate. This accentuation eludes the question of skepticism in suggesting that the concrete, which is always "the pursued" (VC, 23), is exactly what one engages with most directly, what one depends on in a fashion too ordinary to understand as a philosophi- cal subject. As for Heidegger, reality for Wahl is never in doubt: reality makes itself evident through its resistance to subjectivity's desires and claims, but it also exists on all occasions when man just ignores it, taking his encounters in it for granted. Moreover, by reading Being and Time in a way that insists on the spatial and unmediated character of being-in-the-world, Wahl comes to think the sentiment of the body in James together with Whitehead's theory of volu- minosity (which diverge significantly from each other and which do not neces- sarily implicate in the same way what Wahl calls a "receptivite vers la realite" [ VC , 13]). Understood in Heideggerian terms, Wahl's interpretation of reality does not differentiate between the existentiell understanding of reality and existence (in a sense, the sense of reality that one experiences in everyday life) and the existential (in that sense, the analytic) reconstruction of this reality, therefore critiquing the limits of the philosophical interpretation of the world- and maintaining the need for a "mystical vision" (VC, 24-25) in man's access to the world. Wahl thus spatializes and deontologizes Heidegger's treatment of human comportment: his interest concerns the interaction through which the subject remains receptive to the world, always trying to produce reality and marry itself to it, always having a sense of Being and eternal values without ever being able to depend on this sense. What Wahl wants to get from Heideg- ger is not so much a Dasein as an existent with epistemological powers that are by definition insufficient, a subject always already lost in the reality that its existence reaffirms.52 52. To the extent that this treatment of subjectivity led to Wahl's later reading of Heidegger with Kierkegaard, it is well known that Heidegger, already criticized as an anthropocentric metaphysi- cian in Germany, rejected Wahl's synthesis. See the letter to Wahl in which Heidegger (probably in Wahl's own translation) notes that "I must . . . insist that, even though Being and Time engages with 'Existenz' and 'Kierkegaard,' my philosophical tendencies cannot be classified as Existenzphiloso- phie. II I am absolutely in agreement with your claim that the 'philosophy of existence' is exposed to the double danger of falling either into theology or into abstraction. But the question that preoc- cupies me is not that of man's existence; it is that of Being in its totality and as such. Nor is Nietz- sche a philosopher of existence- but in his doctrine of the will to power and the eternal return he poses the ancient and unique question of Being. Yet the question posed in Being and Time is by no means treated by either Kierkegaard or Nietzsche, and Jaspers passes it by altogether" (quoted in Existence humaine et transcendance , 135).</page><page sequence="25">Stefanos Geroulanos 113 Wahl's attention toward science foregrounds and emphasizes the epis- temological dimension of his alteration of phenomenology, which is in turn important for an understanding of what I have called the "spatial dimension" of the reading of Heidegger. Three pages into his text Wahl uses a peculiar passage to approach and critique perception and scientific inquiry. Perception fails in its explanation of the world, and ... it is precisely out of this failure of perception that science is born. In general, we should not make use of perception so as to explain; perception presents, it does not explain. And it is certain that in the domain of explanation, one appeals, first of all, to science. It is not then a matter of closing our eyes to the surpris- ing successes of science, which today has become capable of clarifying, in such an admirable way, even the causes of its limitations, but simply of see- ing that it is an instrument of analysis. Now the real is not constructed by analysis; an instrument of analysis can break down the real, but it is improb- able that [an instrument of analysis] can show how [the real] is made or even describe it as it is. (VC, 3) Two comments: First, Wahl uses in this critique the very same terms that later, in The Philosopher's Way , he uses to identify the importance of atomic physics in transforming contemporary science: "Science . . . today has become capable of clarifying . . . even the causes of its limitations."53 His critique of science resembles the criticism of classical science at the hands of Bohr, Heisenberg, de Broglie, and especially Bachelard, above all because Wahl identifies "con- temporary science" with the antisubstantialism of Whitehead and James, for whom "the unknowable does not disappear" despite the success of science in clarifying "even the causes of its limitations."54 Second, echoing Meyerson's work but also Heisenberg's rejection of pure observation, Wahl argues that perception "presents, it does not explain," while science, as "an instrument of 53. Jacques Duclaux, L'homme devant I'univers (Paris: Flammarion, 1949), 273. By the time The Philosopher's Way appeared, moreover, the epistemological impact of the uncertainty principle had moved far beyond the limits of quantum physics, and echoed the resolution of several prob- lems. For example, referring to problems of experimentation in biology and physiology, Canguil- hem (who was much indebted to Bachelard on several methodological and philosophical problems) wrote, "How is it possible to avoid, here as elsewhere, the fact that observation- which is an action because it is always to some degree prepared- troubles the observed phenomenon?," and, while con- sidering cell theory, explicitly cited wave mechanics as a paradigm for synthesizing irresolvable differences of approach. See Canguilhem, Knowledge of Life (New York: Fordham University Press, 2008), 42 and 55, respectively. In the same work, Canguilhem references and quotes Duclaux to argue that, even in biology, "modern science is primarily the study of a paranature or a superna- ture rather than of nature itself" (28n/35n). 54. This is by no means to say that Bohr, Heisenberg, or, especially, de Broglie would agree to Wahl's descriptions and positive argument.</page><page sequence="26">114 Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France analysis[J can break down the real, but it is improbable that [an instrument of analysis] can show how [the real] is made or even describe it as it is." This double critique not only follows Kojeve's and Bachelard's arguments against rationalist and classical realist conceptions of science but also furthers these through a tone (perfectly clear in this last passage) reminiscent of Heidegger's refusal of science as a derivative interpretation of the world with no special access to the immediacy of reality for man.55 What Wahl is concerned with here is the impossibility of reducing the concrete, especially in its immediacy and immanent appearance, to something that can be known easily and well (or, perhaps , at all). Even though science "shows us the other side of the can- vas" ( VC, 4), it fails because it cannot fully explain or present the less material aspects of the real, an impossibility that Wahl turns back on the subject, so as to determine the latter's receptive welcome of (VC, 13), encounter with (VC, 11), communion with, and prehension of (VC, 12) the real. Contemporary sci- ence is thus of capital importance in Vers le concret , because through it Wahl discerns the impossibility of an absolute identification of the concrete, that is also to say, of any knowledge, analysis, description, or self-sufficient approach to the concrete. Wahl further criticizes philosophy from the viewpoint of an experience of reality, using the same terms on which he founds his critique of science: "The concrete will never be a given for the philosopher. It will be the pursued. It is only in the absence of thought that the concrete can reveal itself to us. . . . the real is the limit of dialectics; it is its origin; it is its end, its expla- nation, and its destruction" (VC, 23). If contemporary science has recognized this limitation- in quasi-Socratically conceding the impossibility of perfect knowledge of the real- then it shares with philosophy the same problem, the difficulty of heeding Wahl's injunction "To the Real!" (Vers le reel!), that is, the impossibility of overcoming the limitations of analysis. If Wahl affirms the acknowledgment of analytic limitations as a scien- tific success that can be understood by way of Heidegger's ontology- "the sentiment of our existence in the midst of things, as this dawns today in philosophy"- he is obliged, by the end of this programmatic introduction, to turn to this "mysterious force." It is clear that he maintains certain reserva- tions and refuses to accept scientific reason as an influence of the new real- ism that he seeks. Nonetheless, despite this quasi-Heideggerian opposition to science, Wahl's realism agrees in all essentials (and in any case metaphori- 55. Wahl also shows his accord with this analysis in a short objection to Raymond Ruyer's interpretation of physics. See Wahl's response to Ruyer after the latter's presentation '"Le psycho- logique' et 'le vital,"' Societe Frangaise de Philosophic, November 26, 1938, published in the Bul- letin de la Societe frangaise de philosophie , 1938, 183.</page><page sequence="27">Stefanos Geroulanos 115 cally) with the stimulus and consequences of indeterminism and uncertainty. Later, and again in clear agreement with Kojeve (ID, 299), Wahl wrote that, just as determinist science had not blocked the deployment of nonfatalist theo- ries of human freedom, contemporary science could not affirm and legitimate such theories, and that the sketch of a philosophy of freedom was in fact even more difficult in their aftermath. All that reveals and unveils the real, the beautiful, Being, the other, and so forth- all that grants a privileged mode of entry and allows us to under- stand these- also re-covers and obscures them, limits our access and repro- duces their inaccessibility: this is the problem that Wahl saw the authors he considers in Vers le concret as addressing. Marcel, James, and Whitehead, regardless of their great differences, furnished him with a way toward the con- crete, a way that cannot succeed, allowing the concrete to redistance itself. This epistemological problem is one that delegitimizes philosophy itself but nonetheless also leaves Wahl rather troubled, particularly in its evocation of "inaccessibility" ( VC, 24-25), for (and against) which he appeals to a "mystical vision" (VC, 26) but also to this (more sober than mystical) "negative ontol- ogy" (VC, 24) that leaves in place the concrete as unknowable yet inelucta- ble. Accordingly, the concrete is for Wahl what is closest and most necessary to man as well as what is most distant to him.56 If the prime philosophical result of uncertainty in physics is the affirmation of the impossibility of a perfect knowledge of reality, of a view from nowhere , in the hands of Wahl, Bachelard, and Kojeve (not to mention Georges Bataille57 and, in the 1950s, of Merleau-Ponty and several other contemporaries58), this amounts to an attack on philosophical anthropocentrism, but also amounts to a turn toward a negative anthropology (Wahl speaks of "negative ontology"): the recogni- tion of a human existence whose only describable aspects are its failures, in this case the failure to concur with reality.59 An emphasis of this sort perme- ates Wahl's later work- especially on S0ren Kierkegaard- but also that of 56. See also Bohr's famous and often-repeated statement that "the new situation in physics has so forcibly reminded us of the old truth that we are both onlookers and actors in the great drama of existence" (e.g., Atomic Theory and Human Nature , vol. 1 of The Philosophical Writings of Niels Bohr [Woodbridge, CT: Oxbow, 1987], 1 19).

The significance of Wahl's use and "critique" of science, as well as of his tempered and not entirely committed references to Heidegger, is indicative of the shift that his work embodied, because his conception of a new sort of real- ism opposed to classical realism, no less than to modern rationalism, follows the contemporary scientific suggestion that science can establish neither a pure reality nor a pure intellectualism, and uses phenomenology to codify this achievement in philosophical terms.60 Instead of a breakdown of the relation- ship between philosophy and science, what we have in the early 1930s is a temporary ambivalent reconciliation, which in Wahl's case came to found and justify his subsequent philosophical attention. This is antifoundational real- ism , through which Wahl and Kojeve can treat the real as both a philosophical and an existential problem, doubting an anthropology that posits man (1) at the base of all interpretation of the world and (2) as the detached observer and humanist actor in a world he can fully describe and affect to the better. Toward a New Individuality: Husserl and Gestalt Physiology Antifoundational realism was not, however, restricted to the specific adher- ents of this philosophical adoption and formulation of quantum physics and phenomenology. The parameters of the "human reality" that Kojeve, Wahl, Koyre, and others helped formulate, using Heidegger and Heisenberg, were just as visible in the work of phenomenologists interested in a different major scientific movement, more specifically, in the 1930s work of Gurwitsch and the wartime writings of Merleau-Ponty. Indeed, if Kojeve and Wahl made asides to questions of the scientist's, and the human being's, perception and embodiment, Gurwitsch and Merleau-Ponty attended specifically to visual 60. Wahl's later role in the reception (in the philosophical community) of Heidegger and his Nazism is ambiguous and worthy of note. Besides the 1938 and 1945 lectures based on a typescript of Heidegger's winter 1928-29 course Einleitung in die Philosophie ( Gesamtausgabe , vol. 27 [Frank- furt am Main: Klostermann, 1996]), which Koyre had brought to Paris (the first course criticized Heidegger's politics; the second ignored the political issue), his later praise of Habermas's critique of Heidegger, and his rivalry with Beaufret, two documents are worth noting. The first, in Father Gaston Fessard's archive, are two copies "sur l'originel, le 10.VIII.1946, prete par J.W." of Heidegger's letter of November 4, 1945, to the university authorities, which suggests that Wahl procured the letter through official channels or acquired it directly from Heidegger (see Archives Jesuites [Vanves], Fonds Fessard, 33/1/1, 33/1/7). The second is a section of Heidegger's "Overcoming of Metaphysics," in Wahl's own archive, sent to him by Heidegger's printer and student Egon Vietta ("Martin Heideg- ger, 'Ausschrift 1939/40,'" in Institut Memoires de l'Â£dition Contemporaine Fonds Wahl, Dossier Heidegger, Chemise "Egon Vietta/texte sur M.

This attention fed into their strand of antifoundational realism, facilitated their critiques of virtually every nonphenomenological philosophy then available, and opened "human reality" (or, in their conceptually rather different terms, "human order") to address particular problems, notably cor- poreality, normality, and individuality. By contrast with the link of Heideggerian phenomenology to quantum physics, the one between Husserl's thought and Gestalt theory is better known.61 Phenomenologists frequently emphasize that Gestalt psychology was "an out- growth of the school of Brentano," which counted Christian von Ehrenfels among its members.62 Kurt Koffka was himself a student of Husserl, and many other Gestalt theorists, including Wolfgang Kohler and Max Wertheimer, noted the profound influence of Husserl's thought on their own 63 Yet Husserl appears to have exhibited limited interest in Gestalt psychol- ogy and, according to Gurwitsch, remained suspicious of the latter's efforts to assimilate it into the phenomenological corpus.64 In France this suspicion was noted but not shared 65 Having defended a dissertation on the relations between phenomenology and Gestalt theory in 1929, 66 Gurwitsch emigrated 61. Most discussions of the origins of Gestalt psychology note Husserl's influence as para- mount. The link of Merleau-Ponty and the Gestalt theorists is well known and widely commented on in the Merleau-Ponty literature.

A third figure who exhibited interest in both Husserl and Gestalt theory was Sartre, who in the late 1930s cited Gestalt theory in his Uimaginaire (1940) and continued to consider the school important in Being and Nothingness (1943). Like Gurwitsch, Sartre explicitly criticized Husserl's effort to retain a pure ego unaffected by experience in his mid-1930s Tran- scendence of the Ego ;72 Gurwitsch subsequently endorsed Sartre's critique in the 1940 essay "A Non-egological Conception of Consciousness."73 Of the three, Sartre was the most cautious toward the Gestalt school and also the one who would return most consciously and intently, in Being and Nothing- ness, to a radical subjectivism. 67.

I want to interweave Gurwitsch and Merleau-Ponty's understanding of Husserl, Gestalt psychology, and Goldstein with their subjects, to explain their arguments for the particular singularity of individual embodied consciousness, the experience of this con- sciousness amid nature or the world, the search for a subjectivity free of the pitfalls of both traditional and existentialist subjectivism. Subjectivity and the Problem of Science Gurwitsch and Merleau-Ponty begin several studies by echoing Husserl's skepticism toward science. In classic phenomenological fashion, for example, Gurwitsch frames his critique of traditional psychology by demanding that psychology stop operating strictly from the abstract and embrace an indi- vidual concrete: The true structure of reality may be as science reveals it. However, not only must scientific theories be verified in terms of "subjective" phenomena and our experiences of them, but, what is more, it is only by starting from the ambient world in which we never cease to exist that the scientific conquest of reality can be undertaken. This conquest, realized by the constructions of the mind, is a creation of the mind.75 In following Husserl's doubts, Gurwitsch emphasizes above all a difficulty that he sees as posed by science's abstraction; he asks how psychology could, without reverting to empiricism, avoid operating at an abstract level that fails to explain individual cases or subjective perceptions of the world.76 To be "scientific" in the traditional sense, psychology would need to refuse the real- ity of the subject's experience, thus relying on a traditional and overly strict subject-object distinction that results in an irresolvable mutual exclusion of 74.

Merleau-Ponty eloquently articulates this structural failure of classical psychology in the preface of the Phenomenology of Perception, and this pas- sage deserves to be quoted in full: Husserl's first directive to phenomenology, in its early stages, to be a "descrip- tive psychology," or to return to the "things themselves," is from the start a rejection of science. I am not the outcome or the meeting-point of numerous causal agencies which determine my bodily or psychological make-up. I can- not conceive myself as nothing but a bit of the world, a mere object of bio- logical, psychological or sociological investigation. I cannot shut myself up within the realm of science. All my knowledge of the world, even my scien- tific knowledge, is gained from my own particular point of view, or from some experience of the world without which the symbols of science would be meaningless. The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scru- tiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening of the world of which science is the second-order expression. Science has not and never will have, by its nature, the same sig- nificance qua form of being as the world which we perceive, for the simple reason that it is a rationale or explanation of that world. 1 am, not a "living creature" nor even a "man," nor again even "a consciousness" endowed with all the characteristics which zoology, social anatomy or inductive psychol- ogy recognize in these various products of the natural or historical process- I am the absolute source, my existence does not stem from my antecedents, from my physical and social environment; instead it moves out towards them and sustains them, for I alone bring into being for myself (and therefore into being in the only sense that the word can have for me) the tradition which I elect to carry on or the horizon whose distance from me would be abolished- since that distance is not one of its properties- if I were not there to scan it with my gaze. Scientific points of view, according to which my existence is a moment of the world's, are always both naive and at the same time dishonest, because they take for granted, without explicitly mentioning it, the other point of view, namely that of consciousness, through which from the outset a world forms itself round me and begins to exist for me. To return to things themselves is to return to that world which precedes knowledge, of which knowledge always speaks, and in relation to which every scientific schemati- zation is an abstract and derivative sign-language, as is geography in relation to the countryside in which we have learnt beforehand what a forest, a prairie or a river is.

They also confirm subjective consciousness as an essential, inescapable source of meaning in its interaction with the world; they refuse the priority of sec- ond-order observation; they link directly to a rejection of a Cartesian or neo- Kantian perspective (which Merleau-Ponty declared to be "collapsing before our eyes" [ PhP , 56]);78 and they open up to the hope shared with Gurwitsch for a different kind of psychology and physiology. They allow for a method- ological rejection of psychology deemed too traditional- notably, empiricist psychologies and Freudian psychoanalysis. In this passage, moreover, Mer- leau-Ponty details and adopts (through his use of the first-person pronoun) the claim that determinations remain insufficient so long as my ownership of my experience remains unrecognized: "I am the absolute source, my exis- tence does not stem from my antecedents, from my physical and social envi- ronment; instead it moves out towards them and sustains them." What is sig- nificant about the marriage of Gestalt and Husserl is that this last claim does not come to signify a radical subjectivism. So how does this resolution work? From Antifoundational Realism to a New Individuality Gurwitsch's approach to Husserl opens by seeing the latter as indicating the existence and role of Gestalt qualities in everyday encounters: when we encounter a group or set of things or people, Gurwitsch writes, we encounter them as "immediately perceivable wholes." As in Gestalt theory of percep- tion, individual elements are subsumed by the "co-existence in conscious- ness of separable elementary data . . . which gives rise to a new sensory ele- ment."79 We are conscious of the "back" of a box (which we do not perceive),80 or of the group that many individual elements make up. Gurwitsch is point- ing here to Husserl's notion of a transcendental reduction , a bracketing of the worldly existence of things so that their givenness to consciousness, their status as phenomena and as intentional content within consciousness, may be examined. Gurwitsch sees the transcendental reduction as analogous to Gestalt 78. See also his critique of neocriticism's failure in matters of science in The Structure of Behavior , trans. Alden L. Fisher (Boston: Beacon, 1963), 2. Hereafter cited as SB. Right after the long passage I quote above, Merleau-Ponty emphasizes that his echoing of Husserl "is absolutely distinct from the idealist return to consciousness" and cites both Descartes and Kant by name as promoting a very different kind of subjectivity from the one he proposes here ( PhP , ix). 79.

It refuses any claim that we experience the world just as it is, or that there is anything in its objects that matters to us that we experience when we disrupt the presumption of a continuity between mind and world and emphasize the recasting of external stimuli through consciousness and its difference from both the world and other consciousnesses. What psy- chology needs to do is explain how we interact with the field of objects before us in a fashion that preserves and thinks both the unity of phenomena and the particularities that we come across. Husserl's utility here resides not in his famous early critique of psychologism83 but in the way that this critique leaves Gestalt theory untouched. Indeed, Gurwitsch sets Husserl precisely as con- firming Gestalt and brings the antifoundational realist question about the co- irreducibility of mind and world to bear on subjective psychology. "If we relin- quish the constancy hypothesis and take whatever is given to consciousness just as it presents itself in its phenomenal nature , apart from all theoretical interpretation, we dispense with orienting the data of consciousness before- hand to objective stimuli, and we allow their descriptive nature to come into its rights independently of all theoretical constructions" ( SPP , 193; italics mine). The transcendental reduction and the abandonment of the constancy hypothe- sis thus signal the possibility of a newfound natural attitude toward objects and themes of the world around us, with everything that is given to us and as it is given to us. From here, Gurwitsch analyzes the problem of form and makes his tech- nical reading of the marriage of Gestalt and Husserl more precise and original in its critique of each one. Gurwitsch and Merleau-Ponty are not concerned as much with form and field as with their application to the human percep- tion of the world, the codependence of consciousness and the field of phe- nomena. This interest extends to a thinking of the dependence of conscious- ness on (as well as its conception of) the physiological and even biological 81. He makes the analogy explicitly in SPP, xxii. 82.

Here the link from perception to embodied experience was offered by the post-World War I work of Gold- stein and Gelb on aphasia after brain injury and on Goldstein's subsequent application of this study and tenets of Gestalt psychology toward a holistic understanding of the organism in Der Aufbau des Organismus ( The Organ- ism , 1934), a book written in the Netherlands as Goldstein was fleeing Nazi Germany for the United States. Gelb and Goldstein's work on brain injury is taken here to overturn the prevalent theories of reflex (including, notably, Ivan Pavlov's). Gelb and Gold- stein showed that localized damage to the brain cannot be interpreted as hav- ing a single, distinct, localizable causal effect: in cases of aphasia, instead, there was no one-to-one correlation between the lesion in the brain and the symptoms exhibited by different patients. "The very complex pictures he was to see in [young soldiers with brain injuries] led him to formulate an ever more elaborate corpus of theoretical concepts."84 Merleau-Ponty cites several of Gelb and Goldstein's studies on brain injury- notably discussing patients who lose their capability for abstract thought and are left with only a concrete behavior- and distills their discussion of local and global effects of brain injury into three principles: (1) "A lesion , even localized, can determine struc- tural disorders which concern the whole of behavior, and analogous struc- tural disorders which can be provoked by lesions situated in different regions of the cortex " (SB, 62); (2) " Nevertheless , nerve functioning cannot be treated as a global process where the intervention of any of the parts would be of equal importance " (SB, 69); (3) " Place in nerve substance has an equivocal signification. Only a mixed conception of localizations and a functional con- ception of parallelism can be accepted " (SB, 72). These principles promoted for Merleau-Ponty, as for Goldstein, an emphasis on the priority of the whole organism over particular symptoms, organs, and organ systems, thus replicat- ing in physiology the problems of form and group that Gurwitsch considers in the case of perception. Then Merleau-Ponty makes one additional important point: it is not the exact composition of the body that conditions consciousness; rather, the physiology of the "normal" body becomes part of the way that con- sciousness thinks of its embodied existence. Goldstein further emphasizes that these (and other) principles suggest that in normal functioning a "central sec- tor" is necessary for an abstract (or "categorical") control of concrete actions. 84.

Here- after The Organism is cited as O.</page><page sequence="36">124 Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France This seemed to reflect the abstract pure ego in Husserl: the part of the phenom- enological existent that remains transcendental and exceeds the empirical and immanent dimensions of subjectivity. This last is a point echoed and criticized by both Merleau-Ponty and Gurwitsch, as well as, famously, by Sartre, and is essential to the efforts of all three thinkers to emphasize the subject's commit- ment and ties to the world. Yet from the perspective of the phenomenologists, the monumental value of Goldstein's work became evident in The Organism. The volume's novelty lay in a series of intertwined arguments. First, Goldstein refused to see facts merely as such; instead, he asked "what kind of a fact an observed phenome- non represents" (0, 28).85 By emphasizing that he was beginning from patho- logical and not from normal phenomena (0, 29), he aimed to understand (among other things) how "pathological phenomena can be recognized as an indication of lawful variations of the normal life process," in other words, how difference precedes the norm, or how pathological organisms may inhabit the same milieu as "normal" ones. Goldstein thus arrived at a particular notion of individuality for which comparison to a statistical norm is useless, but for which the creation of norms in the midst of a milieu constitutes a healthy atti- tude and colors observed phenomena: "An organism that actualizes its essen- tial peculiarities, or- what really means the same thing- meets its adequate milieu and the tasks arising from it, is 'normal.' . . . What we need is not only a generally valid concept of the norm, which should avoid the 'subjective,' but a concept on the basis of which the concrete facts can really be comprehended" (0, 325).86 So abnormal, or pathological, was not an organism with peculiar traits (for that is what each individual is) but an organism or a modification in an organism that renders its milieu uninhabitable, its survival unlikely, its situ- ation catastrophic (0, 48, 55, etc.). In other words, one cannot suggest direct causality or go from the simple to the complex: the modification itself is not as significant as the whole organism's effort to compensate for it within the milieu , that is, as the whole organism's reaction, which can be either one of accommodation and self-transformation or one with catastrophic results. This approach to norms and individuality offers a particular kind of singularity to the perceiving and acting subject that experiences the world. Gurwitsch's commentary on Goldstein emphasizes precisely the kind of individuality this points to: "Knowledge must bear on the one and unique ov, with unity in differentiation, and not on the ovta, that is to say, the multiple 85. Gurwitsch comments on this passage in SPP , 80. 86. For a useful discussion, see Canguilhem, Knowledge of Life, 129.</page><page sequence="37">Stefanos Geroulanos 125 objects separated from and opposed to one another."87 Similarly, Merleau- Ponty, writing in The Structure of Behavior (which he completed in 1938 and published in 1942) of Gelb and Goldstein's studies and Goldstein's Organism , retrieves from it a new kind of analysis which no longer consists in isolating elements but in understanding the character of a whole and its immanent law. Sickness is no longer, according to the common representation, like a thing or a power from which certain effects follow; nor is pathological functioning, accord- ing to a too-widespread idea, homogeneous with normal functioning. It is a new signification of behavior, common to the multitude of symptoms. And the relation of the essential disorder to the symptoms is no longer that of cause to effect but rather the logical relation of principle to consequence or of signification to sign. (SB, 65) The radical novelty of this claim, a physiological sort of rejection of the "constancy hypothesis," is something that both authors highlight: again, it means that the body does not physiologically control consciousness and that it is instead part of how consciousness seeks to adapt to, relate to, and control its environment. As a result, and emphasizing the breakdown of a subject- object relationship and their interdependence, Merleau-Ponty writes that "normal functioning must be understood as a process of integration in which the text of the external world is not so much copied, as composed" ( PhP , 9; see also 7). He emphasizes in his writing that this complex physiological argu- ment precedes and frames (indeed, critiques) Gestalt psychology in that it shows that perception is always dependent on its embodiment and on its nor- mal functioning; perception is not merely something that operates by itself (SB, 150). This is what constitutes the possibility of individual perception, and indeed the possibility of individual action in the world: when Merleau- Ponty writes in the long prefatory passage quoted earlier that he is "the abso- lute source" and that meaning and existence cannot be understood in terms of the physical and social environment alone (PhP, viii). His is by no means a claim for "my" transcendence from the world but an explanation of my con- stitution of my world and my sustenance of myself in it, and my sustenance of it because of my constitution of it and embodied dependence on it. Any effort to identify "me" through a sense of life, humanity, consciousness, zool- ogy, social anatomy, or inductive physiology would fail. The mixture of Gold- stein's holistic physiology and Husserl's phenomenology can instead allow 87. Gurwitsch, "Goldstein's Conception," 80.</page><page sequence="38">126 Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France Merleau-Ponty to reach the principal and most frequently repeated claim of Phenomenology of Perception: "We are caught up in the world and we do not succeed in extricating ourselves from it in order to achieve consciousness of the world" ( PhP , 5); "I have no means of knowing the human body other than that of living it" (PhP, 198). I am in the world and the world is mine, not because I or it takes priority but because in our interconstitution my status as an individual organism and consciousness, as embodied, takes priority over any external (social, scientific, etc.) determination and grants my being mean- ing.88 In this way, Merleau-Ponty can see himself as surpassing even the novel- ties of quantum physics, as moving his interplay of the reality of the world with its dependence on individual subjectivity to a new level: "By accepting the fact that the organism itself modifies its milieu according to the internal norms of its activity, we have made it an individual in a sense which is not that of even modern physics" (SB, 154). Conclusion In this essay I have tried to demonstrate several claims: that French philoso- phy transformed in the 1930s from a neocritical (neo-Kantian) to a phenome- nological paradigm, thanks mainly to the influence of several exiles; that the predominant philosophical movement many of these exiles saw themselves as participating in and as influenced by was phenomenology; that phenomenol- ogy was seen as responding to and linked with pressing scientific concerns that the neocritical approach seemed unable to handle; and that these links and parallel discourses rejected idealism and empiricism in favor of an antifounda- tional realism. The major result of this development was the phenomenological and scientific reconceptualization of man as existing only "in the world," not as a force transcendent to it. With antifoundational realism came a major trans- formation in philosophical anthropology: French thinkers ceased to speak of Man, the Ideal Observer, the Master of Nature; rather, they turned to man, the entrapped being that lives and seeks to accommodate itself right in the midst of a milieu. In some cases, this turn acquired a distinctly existentialist tinge, yet in the others that I have considered here, the antianthropocentrist move did not carry with it (and reorganize) the Kierkegaardian impulse that became so emblematic of French existentialism, but remained tied to the question of a knowledge and mastery of nature. 88. Goldstein famously notes that "in an organism, 'being' and' 'meaning' are the same" (O, 388), and I take Merleau-Ponty to be arguing just this.</page><page sequence="39">Stefanos Geroulanos 127 It would be premature to suggest that a distinct and broadly shared direction of intellectual exile experience is to be found in this transforma- tion, or that these philosophical attitudes translated seamlessly into particu- lar political ones (they did not). But there is still a distinct sense of refusing the given, the foundation, the certitude of the philosophical mind imposed on the world, and with it the politics of existing idealism and then-academic philosophy that unites the emigre philosophers like Kojeve, Koyre, and Gur- witsch with younger French thinkers like Wahl and Merleau-Ponty. There is also a way in which we can claim, retrospectively, that both emigres and younger thinkers found in quantum physics and Gestalt theory a source of authority and legitimacy for their philosophical projects, just as they found in phenomenology a kind of thinking not bound to the traditional notions of transcendence, ideality, and history that seemed so rigid and insufficient. Thus prioritizing "human reality" set the stage for further developments in Hegelianism, existentialism, and the conception of science among philoso- phers of different schools. Kojeve's writings on quantum physics remained unpublished but influenced substantially his thinking of Hegel, with its identi- fication of man with the negation of the given world. Meanwhile, Vers le con- cret provided a manifesto that both reflected the change to anti-idealism and offered a certain systematic alternative joining of the phenomenological impe- tus and the epistemological attention of the younger philosophers (from Koyre through Sartre), clearly delineating a human condition bound by (to use Hei- degger's terminology) man's thrownness in the world, his inability to postulate himself as exceeding or contrasting to the world or to understand or map out this world fully.89 The centrality of antifoundational realism both in philo- sophical and in intellectual terms follows from this epistemological and exis- tential argument. So does the utility of human reality for antifoundational realism: the closure, existence, entrapment that the subject cannot distinguish itself from. Human reality is not just a vague abstraction of the world that man traverses and exists in but also, and more important, a protoexistentialist con- ception of reality in its oppressive guise. In its positive effort, this new philo- sophical "realism," which objected to the classical realism for which all truth lay in the exterior real, reflected this sense of a restriction of man's access to absolutes distinct from or transcendent to the world in which man finds 89. The details of Wahl's realism were by no means unquestioningly shared by his contempo- raries, nor was his realism widely seen as providing a sufficient answer to the philosophical problems it opened. But see Albert Spaier's favorable review of Vers le concret in Recherches philosophiques 2 (1932-33): 468-69.</page><page sequence="40">128 Philosophical Immigrations in 1930s France himself (e.g., an Ego transcendent with regard to reality; a Reason that inter- prets fully, positively, and accurately; etc.). It also marked all subjective access to the surrounding world as borne through the engagement with, the knowl- edge of, and the commitment to this very world. It is against this context, framed so carefully (and in such different styles) by Koyre and his collaborators intellectually, as well as by Kojeve and Wahl in their mixture of quantum physics and phenomenology, that Gurwitsch and Merleau-Ponty framed their own efforts to develop a new thinking of the individual's- indeed of "my"- relation to the world. Essential to this was their reference to the problems posed by visual perception and psychological behav- ior, their criticisms of both classical physiology and classical psychology (including psychoanalysis), and their allowing for Gestalt theory to influence both of these domains- domains grounding, in different ways, the phenome- nological "subject." To them, it was clear that, whatever the limitations of each of these systems of thought, they helped develop a human subject that would differ starkly from that endorsed by neocritical thought and would strike a bal- ance between subjectivity and reality. Gurwitsch later claimed to have thus established a "non-egological conception of consciousness" ( SPP , xxiii), while Merleau-Ponty offered a picture of "my" embodied existence in the world attentive to both the failures of subjectivism and the need for subjectivity and singularity. This would be a subject for antifoundational realism, a "me" for antifoundational realism.</page></plain_text>
