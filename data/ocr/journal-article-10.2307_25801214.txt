<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 18, No. 1, March 2004 (? 2004) The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D.: Perspectives and Research From China and the West Since 1950 Mark Aldenderfer1 3 and Zhang Yinong2 Until recently, there has been no sense of a Tibetan prehistory. Beginning in the 1970s, however, Chinese archaeologists began to systematically explore the plateau, and began to draw an outline of the deep Tibetan past. The pace of research accelerated rapidly in the 1990s, which brought this outline into sharper focus. This paper reviews what is known of Tibetan prehistory until the seventh century a.d., when the Tibetan empire was established. Topics covered in this paper include a consideration of the antiquity of a human presence upon the plateau, changing adaptive strategies following the end of the glacial epoch, the advent of the Neolithic, and the emergence of social and political complexity. Despite significant advances in our knowledge of the Tibetan past, much work remains to be done before models of process can be examined in any detail KEY WORDS: Tibetan plateau; prehistory; adaptation to high elevation; China. This paper is meant to introduce to the western world the archaeo logical research performed on the Tibetan plateau by Chinese and west ern archaeologists. The highest land on the earth, the Tibetan plateau, has only been systematically examined through the lens of modern archaeolog ical theory and techniques and state support after its incorporation into the People's Republic of China in 1950. Prior to this, the only archaeological information about the plateau proper available to the west consisted of the reports of western explorers, such as Roerich (1930), who remarked upon 1 Department of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara, California. 2Department of Anthropology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. 3To whom correspondence should be addressed at Department of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106-3210; e-mail: m.aldenderfer@ucsb.edu. 1 0892-7537/04/0300-0001/0 ? 2004 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">2 Aldenderfer and Zhang archaeological sites he saw while on his Central Asian explorations, brief anecdotes about archaeological discoveries noted by Aufschneider (1956) during his stay in Lhasa in the 1940s, fragmentary and often inaccurate reports on ancient monuments by Christian missionaries, colonial officials (primarily from British India), and adventurers, and finally, more system atic research by Tibetologists, such as Giuseppe Tucci, who made a number of journeys across Tibet in the early twentieth century, and who remarked upon the monuments, sites, and ruins of pre-Buddhist cultures and those related to Tibetan Buddhism (see, for example, Tucci, 1950). In effect, until the latter part of the twentieth century, there was no real sense of a Tibetan prehistory, and there was certainly no significant empirical basis upon which to develop one. The geographical scope of this paper is primarily inside China, which includes most of the Tibetan plateau. Likewise, the materials and conclu sions discussed here have been formed primarily upon the basis of Chinese archaeological efforts after 1950. Archaeological research and cultural relics surveys have been done in Tibet on a general and systematic basis from the stone tools of Paleolithic sites to Buddhist statues in a renovated monastery. Since this paper is concentrated on the prehistory of Tibetan plateau our review concludes in the mid-seventh century (c. a.d. 627), the date of the ascendance of Songsten Gampo to the throne of Tibetan king ship. His reign marks the creation of the Tibetan Empire, which grew over the next 200 years to control the entire plateau, the fabulously wealth Silk Road, parts of western China (including for a brief time the seat of Han power, Xi'an), and much of central Asia (Beckwith, 1987). We will thus not discuss the material remains of Tibetan Buddhism and its related art his torical objects that mostly appear in the period after the seventh century. Western sources on the archaeology of the plateau will also be discussed, but as will be seen, there have been no western-sponsored archaeological projects, and very little participation by westerners in empirical research on the plateau until the late 1990s. THE POLITICAL AND ACADEMIC STRUCTURE OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN CHINA AND TIBET For the sake of a general understanding the archaeology of Tibetan plateau in China and particularly the terms and usage in this article, it is necessary to make clear some possible confusions of the use of the term "Tibet" as well as in the nomenclature and organization of the administra tive system for cultural resources in contemporary Tibet, which is currently based on Chinese ideology.</page><page sequence="3">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 3 Contemporary Tibet is often vaguely referred by scholars in different disciplines in terms of its geographical, ethnographic, and political mean ings due to the complexity of its historical and current situations. The highest plateau on the earth, Tibetan plateau, covers more than 2,500,000 square kilometers of plateaus and mountains in central Asia (Fig. 1). Before 1950, "premodern Tibet," as Samuel (1993, p. 39) calls it, was constituted mainly by three Tibetan regions?central Tibet, Kham (eastern Tibet), and Amdo (northeastern Tibet)?and small population centers in the neigh boring countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and India (including much of what is Ladakh and Sikkhim today). After its annexation by China in 1950 and fol lowing the exile of the Dalai Lama in 1959, the major body of "premodern Tibet" in China was completely separated from that of Tibetan peoples in other Himalayan countries. According to Tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein, the concept of modern Tibet has a twofold meaning: "political Tibet"? a region that used to be ruled by Dalai Lama and is currently named the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) within the Chinese governmental nomenclature, and "ethnographic Tibet"?a much larger area inhabited by all ethnic Tibetan people that covers not only a major part in China but also many regions along the Himalayas in India, Nepal, and Bhutan Fig. 1.

Scale approximate.</page><page sequence="4">4 Aldenderfer and Zhang (Goldstein and Kapstein, 1998, p. 4). While Tibet is still in many areas re ferred to by some scholars by its former integrity and traditional division, it has been reorganized and fragmented into several parts in China. These parts eventually fell into five contemporary Chinese provinces, including the TAR, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan (Fig. 1). With the excep tion of the TAR, Tibetan territory and population only constitute a small part in each of the other four Chinese provinces (Goldstein, 1997; Tsering, 1999). Archaeology in China is administrated by two parallel hierarchies. One is a line from the national Cultural Relics Bureau (Chi: guo-jia-wen-wu-ju) to each provincial/regional/city/county Cultural Relics Bureau/Committee. This bureaucracy controls most of the administrative matters related to ar chaeology within its geographical or administrative scope. Given the cen tripetal nature of Chinese power structure, each subinstitution is directly controlled by its upper ones in terms of its administration and economic re sources. They do not necessarily have cooperative relations with a parallel institution. The other hierarchy is composed of the archaeological institu tions and archaeology departments in universities usually located either in Beijing or in one of the five Tibetan related provinces. These include, for example, the Center for Tibetan Studies at Sichuan University and the Institute of Archaeology at Beijing University, which has a program of Tibetan archaeology. Because of the regional division of Tibetan area studies, as well as different hierarchical reporting structures (i.e. some units may report to the Ministry of Education, while others report to the Chinese Academy of Social Science), there is usually little communication among these academic units. A comprehensive concept of a "pan-Tibetan" re search program is strictly prohibited ideologically and academically since it is easily connected to issues related to Tibet's premodern integrity and the contemporary independence discourse outside China. Although these institutions are often constituted by both Chinese and Tibetan cadres, all re search should be published in Chinese?therefore forcing all Tibetan names (including those of places and persons) into a Chinese transliteration system (pinyiri) which often makes it hard to trace back the original names on maps and in documents. Before the 1980s, research conducted on the Tibetan plateau was mostly devoted to natural science under the authority of the Chinese Academy of Science and supported by the Chinese government. The only exception was the national ethnic identification survey, a nationwide sur vey of all minority groups (i.e. non-Han) during 1950s and 1960s. Its intel lectual basis was the Marxist-Leninist ideology of nationalities. During the 1980s with the relative relaxation of political control and an introduction of a market-oriented economy, most archaeological institutions lost their</page><page sequence="5">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 5 economic security and the political advantages they once had in the state planned economy. The politics of archaeology have since then become a competition for economic resources, usually from a series of state sources, such as the Ministry of Education, Academy of Social Sciences, Academy of Science, and other groups. Within the TAR, archaeology is administered by the Tibetan Bureau of Cultural Relics (TBCR), which maintains a list of major sites found within its territory. As of 2002, this inventory included approximately 1800 sites. The majority of these are not archaeological, and are instead places of historical and cultural significance. For instance, the Johkang Temple in Lhasa, founded in a d. 639, is on the list, as are the Potala Palace, the Norbu lingka, and Ganden monastery (which is mostly in ruins). Not surprisingly, much of the effort of the TBCR is devoted to the preservation and restora tion of Tibetan Buddhist sites and centers. Many once-active monastic and temple institutions were destroyed during the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), and thus became part of the archaeological record. Those ar tifacts that were not destroyed during this period were warehoused in other parts of China or were sold abroad on the legal and illegal art markets. Some of these centers are now being restored to their former glory, such as the major temple complex at Tholing in western Tibet (Vitali, 2000), and some artifacts are slowly returning to their original homes. Sites of earlier time periods did not suffer the same damage simply because so few were known and they were for the most part unrecognized or had no obvious ide ological connotations. However, inadvertent destruction of even these ar chaeological sites is becoming more common as populations expand across the plateau. Also, the systematic looting of tombs of all periods by armed bands is becoming increasing common, especially in Qinghai and eastern Tibet. The chronically understaffed TBCR has found it difficult to manage the huge numbers of sites under its domain under these circumstances. The TBCR employs a number of archaeologists, both Tibetan and Chinese. Some of these researchers have the equivalent of a western Master's degree, but there is presently no PhD-level archaeologist in the bureaucracy (although some are currently enrolled in such a program in Hong Kong), and neither are there any western-trained scholars on the staff. Typical staff duties include participating in archaeological projects as official observers, evaluation of newly reported sites, and preservation related tasks. Some local branches of the TBCR (at the county level in the TAR) have in fact initiated salvage projects and have conducted excava tions. The TBCR does not itself sponsor field research projects, but instead provides local project approval and coordination, reviews reports, oversees curation and warehousing of materials recovered through excavation, and directs conservation efforts.</page><page sequence="6">6 Aldenderfer and Zhang In 1999, the Tibet Museum opened its doors in Lhasa. Prior to this, there was no public institution that displayed artifacts or information about Tibet's past within the TAR. The museum employs a small number of archaeologists who are primarily responsible for developing displays, al though they have recently begun to initiate small-scale research projects and conduct site evaluations of newly located materials. At present, there is limited cooperation between the museum, the TBCR, and research projects, but plans are being considered that would expand the museum's role in regional research and interpretation. The complexity and paradox in contemporary Tibet (Goldstein and Kapstein, 1998) create both ironies and possibilities for a new archaeology on this high plateau which leaves spaces not only for Chinese and western scholars but also for Tibetans themselves. For instance, calls for the development of a new Tibetan ethnic identity in the wake of global move ment of Tibetan independence and the Tibetan diaspora have resonated in archaeological circles in Tibet. As recently advocated by Jiayang?a Tibetan scholar who was until recently the director of Tibetan Cultural Relics Bureau?"the archaeology of Tibet needs a broader academic scope in which Tibet is not isolated from the rest of Asian cultures such as China, India, or other parts of the Himalayas" (Jiayang and Huo, 2001, p. 3). The underlying sentiment of Tibetan identity ironically coincides with the Chinese official discourse of "connection of the tracks" and its interest in approaching international academic and intellectual standards. There are currently ongoing negotiations directed at sending Tibetan students to the west to study archaeology as a part of this desire for "connection of the tracks." How this will play out in both political and academic matters is a source of considerable anxiety in TAR, China, and the west. MODERN ECOLOGY AND PALEOENVIRONMENTS The Tibetan Plateau is the highest in the world with an average el evation of over 5000 m (Fig. 2). This oft-cited figure, however, obscures its extraordinary topographic and ecological variability. Some of the high est peaks on the planet, barren of life, are juxtaposed to deep valleys that have unique ecologies which have only been explored in the modern era. In this section of the paper, we describe briefly the topographic features of the plateau, its hydrology, climate patterns, and ecological and biome structure. Following this, paleoenvironments are discussed. Before examining the plateau in detail, it is useful to review the funda mental structuring factors of high mountain and high plateau environments. As I have argued elsewhere, on the basis of the work of many geographers</page><page sequence="7">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 7 Fig. 2. Major topographic features of the Tibetan plateau. 1: Himalayas; 2: Karakorams and Pamirs; 3: Kunlun Shan; 4: Arjin Shan; 5: Taklamakan Desert; 6: Qaidam Basin; 7: Qilian Shan; 8: Qinghai Hu (Lake Koko Nor); 9: Heixi (Gansu) corridor; 10: Chang Tang. Scale approximate. and ecologists, these environments are characterized by environmental het erogeneity, extremeness, low predictability, low primary productivity, and high instability and fragility (Aldenderfer, 1998, pp. 2-4). Highly dissected topography, combined with altitudinal effects, creates a patchy mosaic of juxtaposed microenvironments with varied spatial and temporal extents. Extremeness (high absolute elevations, very low temperatures, etc.) exac erbates this variability. Low predictability is the degree to which key en vironmental features have a predictable periodicity. High mountains and plateaus are usually characterized by low predictability. Low primary pro ductivity is typical of high plateaus and mountains since they tend to be quite cold and depending on location, often quite dry. Finally, these en vironments are highly unstable, with significant risk of hazard such as mas sive erosion and damaging seismic activity. Resource patches are frequently destroyed though these events. On the basis of these criteria, the Tibetan plateau is among the most ex treme and difficult highland environments on the planet. It is fundamentally a cold, alpine environment where the average temperature in the warmest month is not more than 10?C, and only three portions of the plateau? the Yarlung Tsangpo, Senge Khebab, and Langchen Khebab river valleys, are not alpine by this definition. Since the plateau mostly lies between 30 and 35?N latitude, seasonal climatic variation is strong, with a moderately long winter and relatively short summer, both of which are in great part</page><page sequence="8">8 Aldenderfer and Zhang contingent upon altitudinal zonation. Unlike many tropical high mountain and plateau regions, this strong seasonal variability on the Tibetan plateau improves the predictability of precipitation to an extent. Topography The plateau, created largely by the collision of the northward drift of what was to become the Indian subcontinent and the land mass of what was to become Asia some 40-50 million years ago (mya), apparently reached its modern elevation by at least 8 mya, and probably substantially earlier (Rowley et al, 2001). The Himalayas, the highest mountain range in the world and which stretches in a vast arc along the southern margin of the plateau, were created in this ancient collision. The western and northwest ern margins of the plateau are formed by the Karakorams and the Pamirs, which are almost as high as the Himalayas. Although these ranges are cut through by a number of large rivers, and can be traversed over very high mountain passes, the combination of high elevation and extreme topo graphic ruggedness make access to the southern and western regions of the plateau from these directions quite difficult. The northwestern boundary of the plateau is marked by the somewhat lower Kunlun Shan, which transi tions into the Arjin Shan along the north-central margins of the plateau. The northeastern margin of the plateau is defined by a series of relatively low, parallel mountain ranges, with the Qilian Shan the northernmost of these. In general, these northern ranges are much lower than those to the south and west, and do not present as much difficulty for transit. How ever, as will be shown below, other topographic factors make this region a harsh environment. Finally, the eastern boundary of the plateau is marked by a series of northwest-southeast trending ranges created by major rivers that descend from the interior of the plateau into north-central China as well as southeast Asia. These valley systems are very deep and narrow, and rise precipitously toward the plateau. The extreme northeastern corner of the plateau contains the so-called Hexi (or Gansu) Corridor, where the Machu (Huang He or Yellow) River valley cuts through the mountains, and which affords relatively easy access to the interior of the plateau from the steppelands to the north. The interior of the plateau is divided by other, smaller mountain ranges that generally run east-west. These ranges define four other major topo graphic features: the long, relatively narrow Yarlung Tsangpo valley in southern Tibet, the large, arid Chang Tang (Tib: byang thang) rangeland that dominates most of the interior of the plateau, the Qaidam Basin, and the Qinghai Hu Basin, both located in the northeastern corner of the plateau.</page><page sequence="9">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 9 The Yarlung Tsangpo valley and that of its major tributary drainage the Kyichu, as well as those of numerous smaller rivers, form the modern agricultural heartland of the plateau. Elevations of the relatively flat valley floors range from 3700 to 3900 masl. The valley is arid to the west, and grad ually becomes wetter toward the east. The gradient of the river is gentle, and except in deep gorges, the river and its tributaries tend to form broad, shallow, braided channels. Surrounding these valleys are low foothills and sometimes very steep mountainsides. The Yarlung Tsangpo courses through a very narrow gorge between the two major population centers of Lhasa and Shigatse. As the river flows to the east, it again enters a very deep (over 5200 masl in depth), almost impassable, canyon that contains a unique ecology. In contrast, the Chang Tang is an arid, rolling tableland dotted with lakes, some with areas as large as 1000 km2. The elevation of the southern Chang Tang ranges from 4300 to 4500 masl, while in the north, it ranges from 4500 to 5000 masl. As described by Schaller (1998, p. 26), "The terrain varies from valleys hemmed in by rugged ranges, and rolling hills separated by broad, shallow valleys, to enormous flats, the landscape becoming more spacious and higher from south to north." Vegetation is sparse, and most of the region is barren rock and soil, but in some places, high groundwater tables create large expanses of grazing lands. The Qaidam Basin is a vast depression (when compared to the rest of the plateau) that ranges in elevation from 2600 to 3000 masl. Although a lake once existed in the basin during the Oligocene, during the Pleistocene, it was large and arid (Hanson et aL, 2001). Today it contains a number of small lakes as well as large marshlands that serve as the source of the Machu River. However, the western half of the Qaidam is quite arid, and is covered in varying degrees with shifting, blowing sands, gravel outcrops, and in some places, thick deposits of salts. Small oases fed by glacial meltwaters dot the northern margins of the basin. The Qinghai Hu basin, at 3200 masl, is a large grassland surround ing Koko Nor (or Qinghai) Lake. The terrain here is gently rolling, and vegetation more extensive. The lake itself is brackish. Hydrology Although best characterized as an arid environment, the plateau is the source to a number of major river systems for the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, and China. In the west, the headwaters of the Senge Khebab (Indus), and one of its major tributaries, the Langchen Khebab (Sutlej), are found on the plateau. We have already seen that the headwaters of the</page><page sequence="10">10 Aldenderfer and Zhang Machu (Huang He) are found in northeastern Tibet. In the east, four major rivers originate on the plateau. From south to north, they are the Yarlung Tsangpo (Bramaputra), Ngulchu (Salween), Zachu (Mekong), and Drichu (Yangtze). The flow from these rivers is massive; almost 28% of the water budget of China comes from the plateau, as does 34% of that of the Indian subcontinent. Over 2000 lakes of all sizes are found on the plateau, mostly in the Chang Tang. The majority of these were formed during the glacial epoch and are now fed primarily by glacial meltwaters or in the southern Chang Tang, by convective and some monsoonal rains. As a result of their ori gins, few have external outlets, and as a consequence, many have brack ish or saline waters. Vast salt flats surround some of these lakes, and min ing salt for trade primarily to the Indian subcontinent has a long history. These lakes, because of their characteristics and antiquity, are important data sources for tracking paleoenvironmental variability on the plateau, and consequently, they have been the focus of intensive limnological analysis. A number of lakes have sacred significance, probably of great antiquity. Per haps the most important of these is Lake Mapham (Manasarowar), which is near the famous Mt. Tise (Kailash). Both of these geographical features are sacred to Tibetan Buddhists as well as Hindus, and are still today the scene of pilgrimage. Climate The influence of the Tibetan plateau on global climate patterns is widely recognized (Lehmkuhl and Haselein, 2000). The height and mass of the plateau affect the course of the jet stream, and this has implica tions for other major wind patterns and weather systems at both regional and global scales. Overall, rainfall intensity and humidity decrease from east to west and south to north. The formation of the plateau 8 mya cre ated the conditions for the development of the SE Asian summer monsoon and the winter monsoon. The summer monsoon brings moisture to south Asia from across the eastern Indian Ocean as well as the Bay of Bengal, which is the primary source of the southwest Indian Monsoon (Overpeck et al, 1996). It brings significant summer rainfall to the southeastern plateau. However, the Himalayas act as a barrier to this moisture, and they create a rain shadow along their northern margins. Storms traveling up the major valley systems penetrate furthest into the plateau. Summer climate in eastern Tibet is also wet, created in this case by the major low-pressure system that develops seasonally near the source of the Machu and Drichu rivers. Some summer storms cross into western Tibet from the south, but</page><page sequence="11">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 11 for the most part, these storms do not penetrate deeply into the plateau, leaving most of the Chang Tang and the Qaidam Basin semiarid to arid. Winter weather patterns are dominated by the prevailing westerlies, which are split by the mass of the plateau and Karakorams into two streams. Most of the plateau lies within the rain shadow of these winds, and conse quently, very little moisture reaches it. Winters tend to be cold and severe, with the most frigid temperatures in the northwest and the warmest in the southeast. Most authors agree that the plateau consists of 11 biomes which can be placed into three broad altitudinal zones (Chang, 1981; Ni, 2000; Schaller, 1998; Table I; see Fig. 3). Ecological structure is strongly determined by latitude and elevation, which in turn affect precipitation. The plateau is a complex mix of biomes, but generally, the northeast and the southwest have the greatest complexity, species diversity, and primary productivity. In con trast, most of the central and western portions of the plateau are quite arid and cold, and therefore have limited species diversity and productivity. The north-central plateau is also home to year-round permafrost, as are some of the high peaks in the west, south, and northeast. The remainder of the plateau, aside from the Yarlung Tsangpo valley and the upper reaches of the Ngulchu, Zachu, and Machu rivers, is subject to seasonal frozen ground (Jian, 2000, p. 82). In short, the bulk of the plateau has very low primary productivity, rendering much of it useful only for pastoral pursuits today, or agriculture that is heavily dependent upon irrigation in less frigid regions. However, it is important to remember that like any high elevation environ ment, it is also very patchy, and resources are distributed asymmetrically in both time and space. Table I.

Scale approximate. Paleoenvironments Some authors have speculated on a deep antiquity for a human pres ence on the Tibetan plateau (discussed in greater detail below), but there is no convincing evidence of one until late in the Pleistocene. Therefore, our review of paleoclimates of the plateau begins at 50,000 b.p. Although data are sparse, at 50,000 b.p. the plateau was dominated by the climatic conditions associated with the end of OIS (oxygen isotope stage) 4, a period of glacial advance that was cold and arid (Lehmkuhl and Haselein, 2000). Temperatures were colder than in the modern era, and surface water would have been very scarce. Vegetation would have been sparse, and there would have been considerable areas of barren ground, gravel, and rock across much of the plateau. Most of the mountain peaks of the plateau were covered by glacial ice of limited extent (Lehmkuhl, 1997, 1998; Zheng and Rutter, 1998). However, large areas around these moun tain ranges would have been periglacial in character, and surrounding val ley systems would have been subject to severe wind chill. Although being mindful of the complexity of ecological structure on the plateau, much of it is best described as a hyperarid, cold desert at this time. Between 50,000 and 25,000 b.p. (OIS 3), climatic conditions across the plateau improved. Glacial ice at high elevations retreated substantially, and</page><page sequence="13">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 13 rising lake levels in most areas of the plateau indicate a significant increase in precipitation (Lehmkuhl and Haselein, 2000). It is reasonable to infer that temperatures also increased. As these processes unfolded, desert gave way to steppe formations across the plateau, substantially increasing pri mary productivity. This in turn would have led to the expansion in range and numbers of the large ungulates native to the plateau. Importantly, these improved conditions may have ameliorated the extreme aridity of the large desert basins just to the north of the plateau (the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts), thus making movement onto the plateau from the north more feasible. Glaciers resumed their advance after 25,000 b.p., signaling a return to arid and cold conditions across the entire plateau. Some authors, most no tably Kuhle (1988,1998) have argued for the presence of a massive ice cap on the entire plateau during Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) times (22,000 18,000 b.p.). More recent multidisciplinary research has shown, however, that no such ice cap existed at any time in the LGM or Holocene, and that glacial advances during this period were purely "local" and no more ex tensive than the glaciers of the OIS 4 advance (Schafer et al, 2002; Zheng and Rutter, 1998). Although no ice cap existed, there is no question that plateau climate deteriorated substantially during the LGM. There is good evidence that the summer monsoon weakened considerably, thereby pre venting precipitation from reaching much of the plateau (Schafer et al, 2002). Glacial lakes that had reached their maximum extents during OIS 3 dropped rapidly in level. Desert once again replaced steppe, and the plateau once again became a cold, arid desert. Some climate models suggest that an nual mean temperatures on the plateau ranged from 13 to 2?C lower than in the modern era (Liu et al, 2002), conditions harsher than at any time dur ing the Late Pleistocene. This, coupled with increased aridity, would have substantially decreased primary productivity in most plateau biomes. The LGM signals the start of a gradual process of desiccation across the plateau that extends throughout the Holocene. However, this general trend is marked by local and regional reversals as well as periods of intensification of the process. For instance, the Qaidam and Qinghai basins experienced a period of hyperaridity from 15,000 to 9000 b.p. followed by somewhat less arid conditions in the Holocene. The north-central margins of the plateau saw extensive dune formation from 15,000 to 13,000 b.p.. However, the east ern portion of the plateau became more humid and warmer from 13,000 to 10,000 b.p. due to the reinforcement of the Pacific summer monsoon (Lehmkuhl and Haselein, 2000), and this supported the growth and expan sion of spruce/fir/pine forests, especially in the valley systems that descend to the southeast (Ren and Beug, 2002). Although data are sparse, there is the high probability that broadleaf forest also expanded in the valleys of</page><page sequence="14">14 Aldenderfer and Zhang southwestern Tibet at this time. In contrast, western Tibet remained arid until roughly 10,000 b.p. when a major climatic reversal appeared, creating warm and wet conditions until 9500 b.p.. Arid conditions returned and in tensified until 4000-3000 b.p., but were interrupted twice by wet pulses at 9500-8700 and 7200-6300 b.p. (Gasse et aL, 1996). These pulses apparently stimulated the return of small groves of spruce and fir in sheltered loca tions and where soil humidity was sufficient. Records of these wet pulses have been recorded for central and northeastern Tibet as well. Tempera tures during this period are believed to have been 3-4? C warmer than the present. At 6000 b.p., forests on the plateau begin to contract, a pattern also seen through much of China. Ren (2000) attributes this contraction to human agency, specifically the expansion of agriculture. Although archaeological data from the plateau for this time period are very thin, the timing of forest reduction is consistent with what appears to be the expansion of a Neolithic cultural "package" in the major river valleys of the eastern plateau. Climate change, though, cannot be discounted as a correlative factor, since rainfall diminished and colder temperatures were seen on the plateau after 3000 b.p. (Miehe, 1996). THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE PLATEAU Despite more than 50 years of research on the plateau, it remains the case that we are still ignorant of many of the important historical, evolution ary, and social processes and events that took place upon it through time. In this section of the paper, after a brief discussion of research strategies, we will examine the state of knowledge on the following research themes: the timing of a human presence of the plateau and the changing adaptive strate gies of these early foraging peoples, the appearance of Neolithic cultures, and the emergence of cultural complexity. Not surprisingly, these questions will follow a roughly chronological sequence, and include the Paleolithic, Mesolithic (or what passes for it on the plateau), Neolithic, and historic (as defined by Chinese scholars) periods. Research Strategies Archaeology in China is closely associated with historiography, and a number of authors have noted that archaeology, except when dealing with the Paleolithic period, is essentially a tool used to verify and examine his torical events (Chang, 1981; Von Falkenhausen, 1993). This relationship</page><page sequence="15">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 15 has a deep antiquity in China's past, and has clearly had a significant in fluence on the way in which archaeological research has been conducted. Problem-oriented research as defined in the west is virtually unknown in China, where "problem" is narrowly defined in historical terms. Excava tion to verify history is the primary research method of archaeology. Al though full-coverage archaeological surveys have been performed in China (e.g., Underhill et al, 2002), none has yet been attempted in Tibet. Most of the archaeological surveys and excavations in China, including Tibet, has been directed by a follow-up working orientation, such as salvage conser vation of an early or recently looted tomb, or cleaning up a site exposed by a road construction. Furthermore, the fact that parallel institutions (i.e. two different provincial archaeological institutions) have little communi cation or cooperation also prevents the idea of problem-oriented research on a general scale. The Chinese Academy of Science conducted a series of natural science reconnaissance surveys on the plateau during the 1960s and 1970s which did find early sites, but none had archaeologists as mem bers of such teams until the late 1970s (Huang, 1994, p. 204). Thus it is not surprising that archaeology on the plateau, then, has been overwhelmingly site focused. In addition to history-focused projects, a number of major ex cavation programs have been driven by conservation or salvage consider ations, and these have often played a role in the Chinese nation-building enterprise. For example, from 1996 to 1998, the Shaanxi Archaeological In stitute conducted extensive excavations at the major Buddhist temple and monastic complex at Tholing in western Tibet. This work is described on the institute's home page as a "protective excavation in Tuolinsi Temple under the Helping Tibet Project,... (it) not only has achieved lots of scientific results, but also played an active role in the national economic construc tion and national unity." (http://www.sai.org.cn/gk/gk2.htm). Archaeology, then, is seen not only as a research tool, but as a means by which to cre ate a significant historical connection between Tibet and the remainder of China. Peopling the Plateau Although a number of fossil Homo remains, as well as archaic and modern Homo sapiens specimens, have been found around the margins of the plateau, specifically in Yunnan and Shaanxi provinces (Brown, 1999; Etler, 1996), none have been found on the plateau itself. This has not dis couraged speculation, however, that there is a deep antiquity for a human presence upon it. Huang (1994) suggests that the initial occupation of the northern fringes of the plateau coincided with OIS 3, and focuses on the</page><page sequence="16">16 Aldenderfer and Zhang date 30,000 b.p. as the most probable time of entry. Tong (1983,1989) has argued for an even earlier date of entry before 50,000 b.p. Radiometric dates and reliable archaeological contexts indicative of a Pleistocene occupation of the plateau are scarce (Table II). Huang (1994) describes archaeological materials from the Xiao Qaidam site located at 3100 m in the central Qaidam basin (Fig. 4). Artifacts recovered include simple core and flake tools made on quartzite (Fig. 5). Although the de posits from which the tools were recovered were not dated directly, os tracod samples from stratigraphically correlated deposits dated between 35,000 and 33,000 b.p. Brantingham et al (2001b, p. 321) suggest these dates are too early, and argue for a more likely occupation of the site between 22,000 and 18,000 b.p.. Another site of Late Paleolithic age is Chusang, at 4200 masl and lo cated ca. 85 km northwest of Lhasa along the north branch of the Tolung Chu. First discovered in 1995, the site consists of 19 human hand and foot prints impressed into a now-calcified travertine deposit (Zhang and Li, 2002; Fig. 6). All the prints were pressed into the same layer of the traver tine, and because they had rough, unsmoothed edges, were not likely to have been cut or carved out of the rock. Size differences in the prints sug gest that both adults and children were present when they were made. The travertine deposit began as a soft calcitic mud precipitated as dissolved CO2 degassed and the hot spring water became supersaturated with calcium car bonate. The exact depositional environment of this mud is unclear from the recorded observations. The prints were formed sometime after this deposi tion, and the mud was subsequently lithified, presumably by the addition of calcium carbonate cement, forming the present hard calcareous travertine deposit. Zhang and Li also discovered what they describe as a hearth near one concentration of prints. Unfortunately, no artifacts of any kind have Table II.

Optically stimulated luminescence dating of quartz crystals in the travertine deposits and hearth produced dates rang ing between 21,700 and 20,600 b.p.. Should this locality be confirmed as an archaeological site of this age, it implies that an occupation of the plateau probably took place somewhat earlier than the LGM, and that models of extensive ice cover of the central plateau are in error. Beyond these dated sites, however, there are a number of sites that have been provisionally assigned to the Paleolithic based on typological analysis and cross-dating. Prominent among these are Geting (ca. 4660 masl; Huang, 1994; Qian and Wu, 1988), Duogeze (ca. 4830 masl; Liu and Wang, 1986); Zhuluole (ca. 4800 masl; An et al, 1982), Sure (ca. 4500 masl; Hou, 1991; Tong, 1985), Luling (ca. 4700 masl; An et al, 1982), Hadongtang and Quedetang (ca. 4100 masl; Huo, 2000, and Zhabu (Liu and Wang, 1986); Huo and Li, 1993; Suolang, 1991a). These sites are spread across the plateau from the far west (Zhabu) to the south (Sure) to the eastern Chang Tang (Geting; Fig. 4). What they share are assemblages composed of core and simple flake tools as well as tools made on large blades (Fig. 5). As sumed tool functions include scrapers, gravers, burins, and unifacial points. Some points and flake tools from Zhuluole and Geting have what some authors describe as a Levallois-like technique (Chayet, 1994, p. 30). As signment of these tools to a Paleolithic age are made on comparisons with sometimes very distant sites. For example, the Zhuluole assemblage</page><page sequence="18">18 Aldenderfer and Zhang Fig. 5. Tool forms from major Paleolithic sites. 1, 2: scrap ers from Zhuluole (after Chayet, 1994, Fig. 5); 3: large flake tool, Zhabu (after Chayet, 1994, Fig. 7); 4: scraper, Zhabu (after Chayet, 1994, Fig. 7); 5: denticulate or scraper, Zhabu (after Chayet, 1994, Fig. 7); 6: unifacial scrapers, Xiao Qaidam (after Huang, 1994, Fig. 3). has been compared to that found at Hutouliang in Hebei Province, some 5000 km to the east (Gai and Wei, 1977). One of the best analogues for Paleolithic comparisons, however, comes from Shuidonggou, a site just be low the eastern margins of the plateau dating between 29,500 to 23,800</page><page sequence="19">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 19 Fig. 6. Hand-and-footprints from Chusang (after Zhang and Li, 2002). b.p. in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Madsen et al, 2001). The site is composed of two localities?1 and 2. Locality 1 has an assemblage com posed of large blades and elongated flakes, some of which have been made with a Levallois-like technique. This assemblage is very similar to those found at sites in the Mongolian Gobi and southern Siberia, but which date much earlier (49,000-33,000 b.p.). Unfortunately, no reliable direct dat ing of the Locality 1 assemblage has been made, but Brantingham et al (2001a) argue for a Middle Paleolithic age for the site. However, reli able dates of a similar core-blade technology at Locality 2 range between 29,000 and 23,000 b.p. If this cross-dating is accurate, it suggests a hu man presence on the far western part of the central plateau at an early date. A second technological tradition at Locality 2 of Shuidonggou is of interest as well. Madsen et al (2001) describe a bipolar micro core/microblade technology on small pebbles of chalcedony. Not a true microcore/microblade technology, it nevertheless appears to presage the appearance of such technologies later in time, and which are found at</page><page sequence="20">20 Aldenderfer and Zhang numerous sites across the plateau, especially after the LGM. There is a very real possibility that some of the assemblages found on the plateau and de scribed as microcore/microblade in nature (and thus presumed to be rela tively late in time) are in fact more similar to the bipolar technology found at Locality 2. To verify this, however, would require an exhaustive techno logical reanalysis of these collections. Brantingham et al (2003) report two stratified sites on the shores of Koko Nor at ca. 3100 masl that were occupied between 12,400 and 10,800 b.p. (Table II). Heimahe is a stratified site that contains five stone-lined hearths. No lithics were recovered in the testing, but animal bone was present. The second site, Jiangxigou, has a single unprepared hearth, and with it was found debitage suggestive, but not diagnostic, of a pebble mi croblade reduction strategy. Unfortunately, there are no other dated sites of Pleistocene age on the plateau, thus making it difficult to determine routes of entry and the timing of its occupation. Other data types have been pressed into service to exam ine this problem. Using mitochrondrial DNA (mtDNA) evidence, Torroni et al (1994) argue that indigenous Tibetans have a north Asian and Siberian origin of uncertain antiquity. They do not, however, speculate on the pro cess by which these northern populations entered the plateau. One major limitation of the analysis is the very small sample of Tibetans tested. They further suggest that observed mtDNA mutations in Tibetan populations were not the result of selective pressures for adaptation to high elevation life. A northern or central Asian genetic contribution to Tibetans has been confirmed more recently by Qian et al (2000), but they do not speculate on a likely date of the appearance of the central Asian genes. Su et al (2000, p. 1718), using Y chromosome haplotypes, "postulate that the ancient people, who lived in the upper-middle Yellow River basin about 10,000 years ago and developed one of the earliest Neolithic cultures in East Asia, were the ancestors of modern Sino-Tibetan populations." In this model, a source population moves from the west-central Machu (Huang He, Yellow) river basin onto the plateau into Qinghai sometime around 6000 years ago, and then disperses rapidly across it. This reconstruction places the origins of the Tibetan people very late in time, well into the Holocene. As we will discuss below, while there are some interesting fea tures to this model, it does not accord well with newly obtained data on the Neolithic period on the plateau, nor does it account for the data we have just discussed. Brantingham et al (2003), taking full advantage of recent archaeolog ical discoveries in northern and central Asia, posit a substantially different model for the peopling of the plateau. Their model takes into account the physiological challenges of life at high elevation, resource configurations,</page><page sequence="21">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 21 and potential cultural responses. As a species, humans are lowlanders, and are not adapted to high elevation life. To live permanently at altitudes over 2500 masl requires a suite of behavioral, cultural, and physiological adapta tions (Aldenderfer, 1998, pp. 19-25). Native lowlanders find at high eleva tions that work capacity is reduced, caloric needs are greater, risks of certain diseases, including respiratory infections and altitude-induced illness are in creased, and physiological responses to cold stress are intensified. From a physiological perspective, these challenges can only be overcome by being born at altitude. Their effects can be ameliorated by cultural adaptations that tend to minimize the frequency and distances traveled of residential moves, selective patch choice to reduce the foraging radius, increased logis tical mobility for hunting parties, embedded resource procurement strate gies, development of a transport capacity, and caching (Aldenderfer, 1998, pp. 20-22), as well as the controlled use of fire and the adoption of sophis ticated clothing (Aldenderfer, 2003,2004b). Using concepts like these, Brantingham and others propose a three step model for the peopling of the plateau. The first step brings a source population from the low elevation zones north of the plateau (Inner Mongolia, Gansu, etc.) into northwestern China no later than 29,000-25,000 b.p. and possibly earlier. The second step moves these people into the eastern Qinghai lakes region (at elevations between 3000 and 4000 masl) around 25,000 b.p. but in any case before the extremes of the LGM. It is during this second step that physiological adaptations to high elevation con ditions would commence. The third step, movement to the much higher central plateau, may have occurred at the onset of LGM conditions, ca. 23,000-22,000 b.p. Although the model remains to be tested, it is in gen eral accord with the mtDNA data, sources of technological traditions, and movement across the plateau. Should Chusang on the central plateau date to ca. 21,000 b.p. this would help strengthen the empirical foundations of the model. However, it remains possible that the Qinghai lake sites reported by Brantingham et al (2003) reflect a late (post-LGM) second-step occupation of the plateau. Changing Adaptive Strategies in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene Between 11,000 and 6000 b.p., the archaeology of the plateau is essen tially unknown. With one exception, Layihai in extreme eastern Qinghai (Gai and Wang, 1983), there is no radiometrically dated site known be fore ca. 5000 b.p. (Table II). Consequently, it is difficult to discuss post glacial adaptive strategies with much confidence. It is well known that sites containing a Neolithic cultural package (domesticated plants and animals,</page><page sequence="22">22 Aldenderfer and Zhang ceramics, sedentary life with clear investment in facilities such as houses, ground stone tools) were present on the plateau by 5000 b.p.. Although most of these sites are found along the eastern margins of the plateau, some are known from the central portion of the Yarlung Tsangpo valley. Most Chinese sources, as well as western models derived from historical linguis tics and DNA analysis, favor a migration or colonization process that brings Neolithic settlers to the plateau from the surrounding lowlands. Little con sideration is made of possible indigenous cultural transformations, such as a local process of sedentarization, that could have taken place without a dif fusion from lowland sources. Neither has there been research to investigate how the pastoral economies, which are the basis of current lifeways across much of the plateau, came into being except within a diffusionist context. Obviously, the movement of people and the diffusion of traits did happen, but a more serious consideration of indigenous cultural processes is needed to balance this historical trend. In the absence of data, we can only speculate on the nature of post LGM and postglacial cultural adaptations. We begin with the reasonable assumption that population densities across the plateau were very low in post-LGM times. Environmental amelioration after 18,000 b.p. encouraged the adaptive radiation of humans and plant and animal species. Foragers on the central plateau (should they in fact have been there and survived the extremes of the LGM) would have been able to exploit new and expand ing niches, especially in the major river valleys. In the northeastern and southeastern corners of the plateau, forest expansion implies that lower el evation plant and animal species migrated into higher elevation zones; this in turn may have encouraged foraging groups in these valleys to expand their ranges into the fringes of the plateau. A process like this happened in postglacial times along the western flanks of the Andes (Aldenderfer, 1999). There, foraging groups quickly established permanent residence af ter the initial "discovery" of the plateau (Aldenderfer, 1998, p. 142). In the north, however, hyperaridity in the Qinghai and Qaidam basins may have encouraged foraging populations there to jump from the second step (3000 4000 masl) to the third step (4000-5000 masl) in Brantingham et al's (2003) model. This would have taken place between 12,000 and 10,000 b.p.. In ei ther scenario, small groups of foraging people likely expanded into the most productive niches across the plateau. There are a number of preceramic or aceramic sites that probably date to the postglacial and pre-Neolithic period. Most of these sites have mi crolithic technologies. Microliths and their varied associations continue to vex archaeological reconstructions of plateau prehistory. Most known sites containing microliths are surface assemblages that have been haphazardly collected, and are thus likely to have unknown sampling biases, making</page><page sequence="23">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 23 comparisons tenuous. With few exceptions, most assemblages have not been rigorously described, again making it difficult to identify clear tech nological trends. It also appears that many of these sites are palimpsest occupations created by deflation and erosion. Microliths are also known from excavated sites containing ceramics and bronzes that are clearly of Neolithic or post-Neolithic (i.e. Bronze Age) dates (Tang and Hare, 1995, p. 7). Finally, it is clear that the term itself?microlith?has been variously defined by Chinese archaeologists (Gai, 1985). Once applied broadly to as semblages containing small tools, it now has a more restrictive definition based upon the technological definition of microblade production (blades with triangular or trapezoidal cross-section and less than 10 mm in width). Within this category, however, authors have described a number of reduc tion strategies and styles (Chen, 1984; Chen and Wang, 1989; Duan, 1989; Liu, 1981; Tang, 1999). In Tibet, Chinese archaeologists often describe two traditions of mi crolithic technologies?northern and southern (Duan, 1989; Li, 1991,1994; Liu and Wang, 1986; Tang, 1999; Tang and Hare, 1995; Fig. 7). The north ern tradition includes sites found in Qinghai (Layihai: Gai and Wang, 1983), the central Chang Tang, especially near Shenzha, Shuangu, and Banga (An et al., 1982), and the northern Chang Tang (Mani, Sewugang, Suishaole, and Geladandong). The southern tradition is said to include Zhongba and Nyalam (Tong, 1985) a series of sites along the middle and upper Yarlung Tsangpo valley (Li, 1991), and sites near Rutog in far western Tibet (Huo and Li, 1993b). The majority of these sites are aceramic, although they are often found to be mixed with different kinds of stone tools. Also, some technological traditions are thought to extend into later ceramic pe riods. For instance, Li (1991, p. 60) describes sites with microliths along the middle and upper reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo and places them into five categories: (1) typical microliths with small flake artifacts, (2) typical microliths with both large and small flake artifacts, (3) small and large flake artifacts, (4) uniform small flake artifacts, and (5) uniform large flake artifacts. In his paper, "typical" microliths are defined as those cre ated by direct percussion on small, funnel-shaped cores. The author spec ulates that this type of microlith dates from 7500 to 3000 b.p. Microliths are also found with tool forms thought to be of Paleolithic age, such as at Zhuluole. Technological distinctions define the traditions (Tang and Hare, 1995, pp. 7-9). In the north, microliths are said to be made on a wide variety of core types, including wedge-shaped, flat, conical and semiconical, and cylin drical and semicylindrical (Fig. 8). Microblades are produced by pressure flaking, tend to be rectangular in shape, and are generally trapezoidal to tri angular in cross-section. These assemblages often have a full range of other</page><page sequence="24">24 Aldenderfer and Zhang Fig. 7. Location of major microlithic sites on the plateau. 1: Layihai; 2: Dayutai; 3: central Chang Tang sites; 4,5: northern Chang Tange sies; 6: Zhongba, Nyalam; 7: upper Yarlung Tsangpo sites; 8: Rutog. small tool types, such as scrapers, points, and burins. In contrast, the south ern tradition sites tend to be dominated by flat cores, but also include edge shaped, boat-shaped, funnel-shaped, and cylindrical cores. Microblades are said to be produced by hard and soft hammering as well as some pressure flaking. Southern tradition microblades, at least from the illustrated exam ples from the Chinese literature, seem more like blade-like flakes rather than blades made from prepared microcores. Many of these blades exhibit a pronounced curve, and are frequently triangular in cross-section. As in the north, microblades are frequently found with other tool forms, usually flake scrapers and other flake tools. Brantingham etal (2001b) have observed microliths in association with a blade-and-bladelet technology in the northern Chang Tang. They specu late that the blade technology could be as old as 25,000 b.p., but more prob ably dates to 15,000 b.p.. They do not, however, believe that microblades are of this antiquity, and instead suggest they are of Neolithic age. Illustrations of the microcores from their sites indicate that these could be comfortably placed within the northern tradition as defined above. Because of the lack of systematic work on microlithic technology on the plateau, it is difficult to place these traditions into a broader perspec tive and assess their anthropological significance. Basic chronology is des perately needed to evaluate how and where these tools change across the plateau. Until stratigraphic excavations are conducted, little progress on using microliths as cultural markers or representations of specific cultural</page><page sequence="25">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 25 6 Fig. 8. Microliths from the Tibetan plateau. 1: wedge-shaped cores, northern and central Chang Tang (after An et al, 1982, Fig. 3); 2: flat cores, northern and central Chang Tang (after An et al, 1982, Fig. 3); 3: conical cores, northern and central Chang Tang (after An et al, 1982, Fig. 3); 4: conical cores, northern and central Chang Tang (after An et al, 1982, Fig. 3); 5: cylindrical cores, northern and central Chang Tang (after An et al, 1982, Fig. 3); 6: wedge and funnel-shaped cores, southern Tibet (after Tang and Hare, 1995, Fig. 8).</page><page sequence="26">26 Aldenderfer and Zhang adaptations can be made. However, it is possible to speculate briefly on how these tools may have been used by plateau inhabitants. We begin by assum ing that microliths are not common until after 15,000 b.p., and quite possi bly 10,000 b.p.. Elston and Brantingham (2002), using a risk-minimization model, argue that microlithic tools become important in northern Asia (which would include the Tibetan plateau) as part of an adaptation directed at the intensification of large-game hunting in highly variable seasonal envi ronments. They demonstrate that although composite microlithic tools are more expensive to make than bifacial points, they are more lethal killing tools, and were more reliable than bifacial tools, thus minimizing subsis tence risk. They further speculate that wedge-shaped cores may have been used in high-risk situations, such as hunting for winter stores in highly vari able environments, since tool production was more predictable than with simple boat-shaped cores, which may have been used in less risky contexts. In Tibet, it is interesting to note that wedge-shaped cores form the primary component of the northern tradition, while boat-shaped cores are found in the south. If time is not a factor in this, this suggests that northern foragers faced greater subsistence risk and may have had higher levels of residen tial mobility than their southern counterparts. This is certainly consistent with modern ecological structure, wherein the Chang Tang (the north) is a patchy, arid environment whereas the south (primarily the major river valley systems) is relatively benign by comparison. The Neolithic of the Tibetan Plateau As Underhill (1997, p. 105) notes, the Neolithic in China is said to be characterized by "... pottery, ground stone tools, sedentism, cultivation, and animal husbandry." This definition has been extended to the Tibetan plateau, but with the clear proviso that the Neolithic there has a number of significant differences when compared to its low-elevation counterpart, and appears also to have a much longer duration. Although there are fewer Neolithic era sites known on the plateau compared to earlier time peri ods, excavations and data recovery at these sites are far more complete, and consequently, we have a more secure understanding of many aspects of Neolithic lifeways than of the Paleolithic How the Neolithic is characterized depends on location. For instance, there are a large number of Neolithic sites known from the extreme north eastern part of Qinghai near its border with Gansu. The western Machu (Huang He or Yellow) River valley has been extensively studied exten sively by Chinese archaeologists (Chang, 1986, pp. 138-150) and conse quently, they have extended the Neolithic phase names from this region</page><page sequence="27">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 27 into this area of the plateau. These are generally applicable to this spe cific region, but cannot be extended beyond it. Elsewhere on the plateau, archaeological cultures are named after specific sites, such as "Qugong cul ture" or "Karou culture." As more information is generated, it is likely that these will become phase names for the Neolithic. There are four areas on the plateau where Neolithic period sites have been extensively examined: the extreme northeastern corner of Qinghai near its border with Gansu, around the modern city of Chamdo at the east ern edge of the plateau near the Zachu (Mekong) River, at the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo river as it turns southward, and on the central plateau in the Yarlung and Kyichu valleys (Fig. 9). Table III lists reported radiocar bon dates from these sites. In addition to research at village or habitation sites, there has been considerable work directed at the excavation of burial mounds and tumuli across the plateau, and many of these tombs appear to be Neolithic (Huo, 1995; Xiage, 1998). The earliest known Neolithic culture on the Tibetan plateau is found near the modern city of Chamdo at Karou (Table III). The site is found at 3100 masl on a high terrace above the Zachu (Mekong) River. The to tal site area was estimated to be 1 ha, of which 1800 m2 was systemati cally excavated over 2 years (1978-79) by a joint archaeological team of Cultural Relics Administration of the TAR and the history department of Sichuan University led by Chinese archaeologist Tong Enzheng (Bureau of Cultural Relics, Tibet Autonomous Region and Department of History, Siachuan University [BCR], 1985; Tong, 1990).

Although some archaeologists continue with efforts to make the occupation of Karou as early as possible, the range of occupation fits most comfortably from ca. 4000 to 2000 b.c. No cemetery was located, although one rectangular stone tomb was located near the site and has be come the definition of the "Karou tomb type" (Xiage, 1998). The earliest occupation level (4) contained the remains of seven structures interpreted as domestic residences. Of these, three were rectangular in form and semi subterranean in construction, and ranged in size from 13.8 to 24 m2in cov ered floor area. Two were round or ovoid pit structures, somewhat smaller (10.1-11.4 m2 areas) with central hearth features. Two other structures were incomplete. In Level 3, many more structures were present. All but one (a roughly ovoid structure partially destroyed by construction) were rect angular and of semi-subterranean construction. Those with central hearth features ranged in covered floor area from roughly 12 to 34 m2; one struc ture with what appeared to be multiple rooms or a covered patio had 69 m2 of floor area. Smaller structures without hearths (presumably small stor age facilities) were adjacent to some of these residences. Reconstructions of both the storage and residences suggest that ladders were used to enter and exit them. In Level 2 (said to be the later occupation), was a single com plex of three semi-subterranean structures with interior walls composed of rough, uncut stone. Two of these structures (F5 and F12) had a large central</page><page sequence="29">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 29 hearths and F12 had a bench against one of the interior walls (Fig. 10; BCR, 1985, p. 33). The authors of the report reconstruct this complex with flat roofs, which resemble some modern Tibetan architecture (Fig. 11; BCR, 1985, p. 36). Other features on the Level 2 surface include two stone walk ways, a large rectangle of stone with of uncertain function, a small stone pen, and circular stone features. The artifacts recovered from Karou are impressive. Ceramic forms are primarily basins, bowls, and jars, and are for the most part incompletely fired. Decorative motifs are incised and graved geometric patterns with some applique, cord-marking, and basket impressions. One vessel shows traces of black and red paint. The lithic assemblage includes chipped stone tools, debitage, some microliths, and ground stone and polished tools. Flake tools are much more abundant than microliths. Most of the microlithic cores are conical or polyhedral in form, although some wedge-shaped and Fig. 10.

Reconstruction of Level 2 structures, Karou (after Bureau of Cultural Relics, Tibet Autonomous Region and Department of History, Sichuan University, 1985, p. 36). boat-shaped cores are present. Bone tools are abundant as well, and include awls, probable weaving tools, needles, and combs. Decorative objects in clude stone pendants, jade pins, perforated shells, and stone bracelets. The presence of ceramic spindle whorls indicates textile production, but it is not clear what was being spun. Subsistence at Karou is said to be characterized by a mix of hunting, gathering, and plant cultivation. Animals hunted include red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), goral (a small, goat-like antelope; Naemorhedus goral), serows (SE Asia wild goat; Capricornus sp.), Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata), Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis), and woolly hare (Lepus ojostolus). Unidentified bovids are also present, as are various species of macaques, rodents, and rats. Pigs (Sus sp.) are present, and are thought to be domesticated. Plant remains include culti vated millet, chenopods (likely to have been collected), and other plants. Although the excavators speculate that Karou has similarities to sites in northwestern Sichuan, such as Lizhou (BCR, 1985, p. 178), they con clude their evaluation of the site by suggesting that it is a representation</page><page sequence="31">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 31 of an indigenous Tibetan archaeological culture. Indeed, other sites in the Chamdo area, such as Xiaoenda (Bureau of Cultural Relics, Tibet Au tonomous Region [BCR], 1990; Hou, 1991) with its similar cultural content, reinforce this interpretation. Although its occupations are contemporary with the Majiayao, Banshan, and Machang cultures to the north, they are significantly different from these in terms of content, and clearly do not owe their origins to them. As more data are recovered from Sichuan and Yunnan, connections to the plateau from these regions may move from the realm of almost pure speculation to more reasoned analysis (Wang, 1994). The second major Neothlic site found on the plateau is Qugong, lo cated 5 km north of Lhasa at an elevation of 3680 masl (Huo, 2000; Insti tute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Science and Bureau of Cultural Relics, Tibet Autonomous Region [IOA], 1991a,b, 1999b). The site is found along the margins of a low hill at the base of higher hills and mountains. The site was heavily eroded, and had also suffered damage from local villagers who used the soil of the terrace for construction projects. Por tions of the site were also damaged by intrusive tombs. The original extent of the site was estimated to be ca. 1 ha, and of this, ca. 0.4 ha were exca vated. A mortuary component, containing 32 tombs, is found some 300 m to the northwest. According to the excavators, the site could have been oc cupied as early as 1750 b.c (Table III), and was probably abandoned by ca. 1100 b.c. Note that these occupations are considerably later in time than those at Karou, and they overlap substantially with the Chinese periodiza tion of so-called Chalcolithic and early Bronze Age cultures such as Qijia (ca. 2000 b.c), Siwa (1300-1000 b.c) and Xindian (ca. 1000 b.c) of Gansu and northwestern China. The deposit is divided into early and late components. The early com ponent had no structural features present aside from a number of ash pits and three tombs. The later component was defined as one of "rede position," which in this case appears to mean the reworking of the de posit through time. The ceramic assemblage is described by the investiga tors as "mature," meaning that many of the vessels are finely made and highly fired (especially when compared to the Karou assemblage), and in clude both hand molded and wheel-thrown examples. Some of the finest ceramics are a highly burnished blackware. However, decoration contin ues to consist of geometric forms executed by incision, punctation, and some painting. Forms include bowls, jars, and cups. The lithic assemblage still contains a few microliths made on wedge- or boat-shaped cores, and a wide variety of types, including unifacial points. Grinding stones for both subsistence and pigments (red ochre) are common. Bone tools include awls, needles, points, hairpins, combs, and probable weaving implements. Only one bronze artifact?an arrowhead?was recovered from the site. A</page><page sequence="32">32 Aldenderfer and Zhang detailed analysis suggests it is of local origin. Subsistence practice was not examined in detail for plants (only a pollen analysis was conducted), but faunal remains included examples of yak (Bos grunniens), domesticated sheep (Ovis aries shangi), musk deer (Moschus moschiferus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), Thorold's deer (Cervus albirostris), domesticated pig (Sus scrofa), Tibetan ass (kiang; Equus hemionus kiang), dog, and some birds. Not surprisingly, animal husbandry is of great importance, but hunting con tinues to be a significant part of subsistence effort. The tombs that are clearly associated with the early deposit are small, square-to-rectangular in form, with walls made of stone. The floors are soil. They contain secondary burials in a flexed position. Only one tomb had grave goods, which consisted of utilitarian ceramics. Unfortunately, it is not clear which tombs from the cemetery component of the site date to the Neolithic, but it seems certain that the majority date to the Bronze Age and later (Xiage, 1998). One of these tombs contained a spectacular bronze mirror, the first found in any archaeological context in Tibet, and of clear Central Asia origin. The dating of the mirror is controversial, but consen sus is beginning to emerge that the mirror appeared in this portion of the plateau some time between 800 and 500 B.C. based on the examination of stylistic motifs and its chemical composition (Huo, 1994,1997; IOA, 1999b; Zhao, 1994). Other sites associated with Qugong and which have had some sys tematic work include Changguogou, located south of Lhasa on the north bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo at an elevation of 3570 masl (He, 1994; IOA, 1999a; Li and Zhao, 1999), Bangga in the Yarlung Valley (Zhao, 2002), and Qinba (Suolang, 1986). Although not radiocarbon dated, the archaeologi cal assemblage, especially the ceramics, at Changguogou, are very similar to those found at Qugong. Excavations at Bangga have uncovered at least one rectangular semi-subterranean house with 24 m2 of covered floor area, stone-lined interior storage pits (one of which was used for a secondary burial), and ceramics similar to those at Qugong. Sites thought to be part of the Qugong tradition but which have seen limited work are those in the great bend area (Nying-khri/Nyingchi) of the Yarling Tsangpo, such as Jumu, Beibeng, and Maniweng, among others (Chayet, 1994, pp. 46-47). Most of the authors who have worked with Qugong materials argue that this archaeological culture has its origins in the earlier Karou culture, and as such, it is an indigenous Tibetan development. What is known of it suggests a village-based society with limited social differentiation as in dicated by mortuary remains. Qugong likely had trade connections with cultures in Sichuan and possibly central Asia, and certain technologies, like metal working in bronze, had apparently entered the central plateau sometime before this.</page><page sequence="33">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century a.d. 33 If Karou and Qugong are thought to be "Tibetan," the Neolithic cul tures in extreme northeastern Qinghai are clearly of lower elevation ori gin. The dating of Neolithic cultures in this area remains controversial. The Yangshao culture is well known from eastern Gansu and the central Huang He (Yellow) River valley, and is said to date between 5000 and 3400 b.c. (Underhill 1997, p. 118). Its presence in Qinghai has been debated, and a local culture, Shilingxia, is said to be its extreme western variant (Chayet, 1994, p. 51). However, it seems more reasonable to regard this culture as an early expression of the following culture, Majiayao (3400-2800 b.c.), which is well defined in Qinghai. Important sites of this culture include Sunjiazhai, Shangsunjia, and Hetaozhuang (Chang, 1986, pp. 142-144). They are said to be between 20 and 30 smaller sites in extreme eastern Qinghai that have traces of Majiayao culture, primarily ceramics. This culture is characterized by rectangular semi-subterranean houses, grinding stones, polished stone axes, hoes, large numbers of bone tools, and impressive ceramics painted in red and black with geometric and animal motifs. Sites in Gansu of this culture are known to have broomcorn and foxtail millet as well as hemp fruits. Cemeteries are found near the largest villages, and in the Qinghai sites, burials are secondary and found in wooden coffins. Some burials had significant quantities of painted ceramics accompanying them. The next cul ture to be found in the region is Banshan (2800-2300 b.c.), which is known in Qinghai primarily from the famous mortuary site of Liuwan (Chayet, 1994, p. 53). A total of 257 burials of this period were discovered, and burial treatments ranged from secondary to simple, extended burials through mul tiple burials within the same rectangular wooden coffin. Burials were ac companied by a wide variety of artifacts, including the famous Banshan ceramics, stone tools (both chipped and polished), bone tools, and some decorative objects, including turquoise, bone, and stone beads as well as stone bracelets. The final Neolithic culture in this region is Machang (2300 2100 b.c). Although best known from Liuwan, there are villages sites known from this period in Qinghai, including Machangyan. Subsistence continues to be focused upon millet, and residential structures are similar to those of the preceding cultures. The majority of burials at Liuwan date to this cul ture, and while burials are generally similar to those of earlier cultures, the ceramics now have significant number of anthropomorphic motifs as well as geometries that resemble certain characters of early historic writing sys tems (Chang, 1986, p. 150). Some mortuary treatments are impressive?one Machang burial from Liuwan had more than 90 highly decorated ceramic vessels One additional source of data on the Neolithic is the very large num ber of mortuary sites examined by Chinese archaeologists. In comparison to habitation sites, which are usually buried by alluvial or colluvial processes,</page><page sequence="34">34 Aldenderfer and Zhang mortuary sites are distinctive since they often are characterized by above surface mounds of varying shapes and sizes. Mortuary sites are found along the Nyechu (Longzhi) River in the Lhoka (Shennan) region in southern Tibet, near Nying-khri (Nyingchi) of the Yarlung Tsangpo valley, and near Shigatse. Many of these sites have been tested and excavated, but unfortu nately, the data recovered from them tend not to be examined systemati cally, and few of the sites have been dated by radiometric methods. Conse quently, typologies of mound types are constructed on the basis of the few sites that have been dated, and by assumptions about site age and affiliation based on cross-dating of artifact types, often from areas far-flung from the plateau. Two archaeologists?Huo (1995) and Xiage (1998) have attempted to systematize these data for the central and southern parts of the plateau. Despite these efforts, clear patterns are not obvious. Tombs assigned to the Neolithic are described as "stone coffins," are square or rectangular in form, and are made either with large flat slabs for walls and floors, or coursed, un cut stone used to construct walls. An uncommon, more complex form is said to be a stone cyst tomb with an entrance, tunnel passage, and central chamber (Huo, 1995). Burial goods, if present, tend to be simple decora tive objects (stone beads) or small amounts of local ceramics. Burial treat ments tend to be flexed, and are often secondary. Some of these tombs, especially those in the vicinity of Karou, are thought to have originated from migrants to the plateau of people from the adjacent, lower elevation valleys on western Sichuan (Tong, 1978). In short, while tombs are in abun dance on the plateau, they currently contribute little to our knowledge of the Neothlic because they have not been systematically dated and associ ated with habitation sites. The most controversial question of the Neolithic on the Tibetan plateau is the debate over the origins of what are known today as the Tibetan people. Some authors have argued strongly that the majority of the current ethnic inhabitants of the plateau owe their origins linguistically, culturally, and biologically to migrations of people from east Asian sources during the Neolithic. This issue has already arisen in the discussion of the peopling of the plateau during the Paleolithic. We have already alluded to the shifting meanings of the term Tibet" and "Tibetan," and thus it should not be surprising that considerable confusion accompanies this debate. Renfrew (2000) has summarized current directions in research that has attempted to correlate in a systematic manner historical linguistics, molec ular biology, and archaeological data, and while optimistic about the future of this synthesis, nevertheless observes that making explicit correlations between languages, "races" or ethnic groups, and archaeological cultures is fraught with difficulty. Nevertheless, a number of authors have made the attempt to create such a synthesis for the occupation of the plateau. The</page><page sequence="35">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 35 most prominent of these are those by Su et al. (1999, 2000) and van Driem (1998,2001,2002). Su and others' model asserts that that deep in prehistory, a SE Asian population moved into southern China, specifically into Yunnan and Guangxi. Using a specific dominant Y haplotype (M122C), Su et al. (2000) argue that this south China-based population moved into the central and western Machu (Huanghe, Yellow) river basin sometime between 20,000 and 40,000 b.p. (Fig. 12). They label this group "Proto-Chinese," which over time genetically and linguistically diverges into what they call "Proto Sino-Tibetan." Around 10,000 b.p., this population began to grow substan tially, and budding daughter populations were forced into new niches, with Fig. 12. Su et al. (2000) model of population and linguistic relationships. 1: proto-Chinese entry into Yellow River drainage between 40,000 and 20,000 years ago; 2: formation of proto-Sino-Tibetan ca. 10,000 years ago; 3: proto-Tibeto-Burman ca. 6000 years ago; 4: central Asian genetic contribution ca. 6000 years ago.</page><page sequence="36">36 Aldenderfer and Zhang some of these populations moving further to the west along the Machu. Around 6000 b.p., another linguistic shift occurs, with what are now called "Proto-Tibeto-Burmans," which move from their western Machu and east ern Qinghai focus across the Tibetan plateau. With yet another linguistic split, one group (Baric speakers) moves to the south, crossing the Himalaya, and moving back into northern Yunnan, Bhutan, and northeastern India. Still another group (Bodhic speakers), after having received a significant genetic admixture of an unspecified central Asian or southwestern Siberian population, moves across the entire Tibetan plateau. The authors argue that this model is supported by archaeology (Cavalli-Sforza et al, 1994, p. 206) and linguistics (Matisoff, 1991; Wang, 1994). van Driem's model is similar to that of Su and others but makes a stronger attempt to integrate archaeological data. He begins with a histor ical classification of Tibeto-Burmese languages, and divides them into two major groups?an eastern and western variant (van Driem, 2001, p. 399). Of concern here is the eastern group, which can be further subdivided into two groups?northern (Sino-Bodic) and southern languages (which are found in SE Asia). Sino-Bodic is split into a northwestern (Bodic) and a northeast ern (Sinitic) group of languages. Bodic can then be split into Bodish (the source of languages spoken on the plateau) and Himalayan (various lan guages spoken along the Himalayan chain as well as Kashmir in the distant west). This language phylogeny is distinctly different than that proposed by Matisoff (1991). Given the relationships between these language families and their spa tial distribution, van Driem (2001, pp. 408-433) proceeds to create a hy pothesis of how this patterning can be explained. He postulates the exis tence by 11,500 b.c. of an ancestral homeland of Tibeto-Burmese speakers in the middle and upper Yangtze (Drichu) river of Sichuan. This popula tion served as the source of the early Neolithic groups in both the eastern (Peiligang) and western (Dadiwan) Huanghe basin. Both areas were occu pied as early as 6500 b.c., and van Driem labels them as "Northern Tibeto Burmese" speakers (Fig. 13). He suggests that the clearest archaeological correlate of this migration is what he terms the "abrupt" replacement of lo cal microlithic-using cultures by the Dadiwan cultivators (van Driem, 2001, p. 417). These migrants brought with them cord-marked pottery and pol ished stone tools, which van Driem takes as cultural and ethnic markers. The postulated lingustic divergence that created Northwestern Tibeto Burmese (Bodic) languages is directly correlated by van Driem with the appearance of the Majiayao Neolithic in Gansu and extreme eastern Qing hai, which he dates as early as 3900 b.c.. He argues that this group not only migrates onto the plateau proper, ultimately spreading Bodish lan guages across the plateau, but that it is also responsible for the appearance</page><page sequence="37">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century a.d. 37 Fig. 13. van Driem's (2002) model of population, linguistic, and archaeological relation ships. 1: ancestral home of Tibeto-Burman speakers, ca. 11,500 b.c.; 2: "Northern Tibeto Burmese speakers," ca. 6500 b.c.; 3: Kashmiri "Northern Neolithic," ca. 2700 b.c. of what he calls the "Northern Neolithic" cultures of Kashmir by 2700 b.c, This group of Himalayan family language speakers then populates the southern fringes and valley systems of the Himalayan chain after this date. Although he does not mention either Karou or Qugong or any of the other central Tibetan plateau archaeological sites in his model, it is clear that these cultures would be considered derivative from the Majiayao Ne olithic, in sharp contrast to the assertions of the Chinese archaeologists who excavated them. van Driem (2002, p. 241-243) discusses the genetic data available at the time and how they integrate with his linguistic model. He argues that the Su et al model is flawed because it is based upon an inadequate sampling of Tibeto-Burman speakers in outlying, but critical, areas of the Himalayas, and further, the linguistic phylogeny is flawed. He asserts that Chu et aVs</page><page sequence="38">38 Aldenderfer and Zhang (1998) use of microsatellite markers is a more comprehensive reconstruc tion of east Asian population relationships, which also included groups from outside the region for comparative purposes, and that it is general accord with his archaeo-linguistic reconstruction. What are we to make of these models? While they are broadly plau sible, they suffer from a number of problems that limit their utility. Look ing first at the genetic data, it is clear that both suffer some methodologi cal defects. Su et al.ys model is based upon a very small sample given the complexity of the argument. And while van Driem claims that the Chu and others' model supports his position, a careful reading belies that assertion. As expected, their model shows that Tibetans have a greater genetic sim ilarity with the northern Chinese than they do with other east Asian peo ples or groups from different areas. However, when they examine only east Asian populations, their results are surprising, and place Tibetans into a mixed group of southern and northern Chinese. Given this wholly unex pected finding, Cavalli-Sforza (1998, p. 11052), while generally laudatory of the Chu and others model, suggests these data be viewed with caution. This is especially concerning given that two studies using different genetic markers?Torroni and others and Qian and others?have confirmed the presence of central Asian genes in modern Tibetan populations. We suggest that the Chu and others study has little reliable to say about the peopling of the plateau, and that they offer no support for van Driem's reconstruction. Both models assume that archaeological cultures are direct material indicators of ethnicity and language. Seldom, if ever, does a single artifact type, burial practice, or stylistic motif unambiguously represent a set of genes or language. Moreover, the models simply assume language dispersal via migration, and as Renfrew (2000, pp. 24-26) and others have pointed out, there are other mechanisms for language dispersal that do not assume the direct, large-scale movement of people. Another problem with the models is that they rely upon selective use of inaccurate and incomplete archaeological data. Both models ignore entirely the central Tibetan Neolithic sites. Their use of the western Machu (Huanghe, Yellow) river data is generally accurately portrayed in terms of cultural content and dating, however, and to be fair to van Driem (2001, pp. 419-420), he does assert, following Chang (1986), that one important source of plateau population is likely to be the western Drichu (Yangtze) river valleys of western Sichuan. However, perhaps the greatest flaw of both models is the simplistic way in which migration is conceived, van Driem (2001, pp. 423-425) of fers a number of motivations for Majiayao Neolithic people to move to the west, including ecological calamity, stress, or simply, "tidings of prosper ity from the west." Unfortunately, for these models, their authors appear</page><page sequence="39">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 39 not to have looked carefully at their maps and considered the subsistence technologies of these people in their desire to move them about the land scape. Both models have agricultural peoples from relatively low elevations moving up to the high plateau and across the hyperarid and frigid Chang Tang. Only pastoralists thrive in these portions of the plateau, and it is far-fetched indeed to believe that these sedentary agriculturalists somehow moved a Neolithic "package" across the Chang Tang and into the far west without significant changes to that package. These models also ignore all of the problems created by hypoxic environments and their effects on human physiology. In short, they assume demic diffusion, rather than some alter native, without thinking seriously of how the subsistence system of the cul tures could have likewise been transported, and how these cultures adapted to the known rigors of life at high elevation. A more plausible model of the appearance of the Neolithic cultural package on the plateau is one that supports a mosaic of both demic and ac culturation mechanisms. Demic diffusion is clearly plausible in Qinghai, but the spread of the Majiayao Neolithic package should be limited to Qinghai. Central Tibetan plateau sites have few direct material affinities with these cultures, and we should be looking elsewhere for their sources. We agree with van Driem that Sichuan is a likely source for a Neolithic package, and it is very likely that demic diffusion pushed populations up the major river val leys of the eastern plateau. Instead of moving these Tibeto-Burmese speak ers north, then back south again, it is far more parsimonious to move them from Sichuan upward onto the plateau. Karou may have been founded by this demic expansion, and if this is the case, we should find more Neolithic sites expanding up all of the major valley systems sometime after 6000 b. p., a date consistent with Ren's (2000) model of agricultural expansion. The mechanism for the expansion of the Neolithic across the plateau could be either demic diffusion or acculturation, but since the data are scanty, it is not possible to test either alternative. However, an acculturation mechanism may be the best explanation for the presence of central Asian or southwest ern Siberian genes in Tibetan populations according to Su and others model if we assume that these genes were those associated with the Mesolitihc peo ples of the plateau who adopted the Neolithic package or married into it. Qugong, as a descendant of Karou, appears to reflect an indigenous expan sion of the Neolithic into new niches further to the west. Just how complex are the central plateau sites? This question cannot be answered at present simply because few sites have been excavated, and none have yet been placed into a regional scale settlement system. The mortuary data suggest that significant social differentiation had not yet occurred on the central plateau by ca. 1900 b.c. This stands in stark con trast to the Qinghai Neolithic sites, where displays of wealth accompanying</page><page sequence="40">40 Aldenderfer and Zhang burials suggests some social ranking in place in that region by the end of the Neolithic. It is important to remember, however, that both the central plateau and Qinghai are quite simple when compared to cultural develop ments taking place further to the east in China, such as the Xia Dynasty, which is said to have been founded around 2200 b.c Toward Complexity As we move toward the known complexity and political centralization that accompanies the emergence of the Tibetan empire in the mid-seventh century a.d., it is the case that historical documents, rather than archaeo logical evidence, serves as the primary record of the period from the end of the Neolithic onward. In China, we now enter the period of the histori cally known dynasties beginning with the Shang (ca. 1700-1100 b.c.) to the Sui (a.d. 580-618). During this period, China itself saw varying degrees of political centralization, retraction, and territorial expansion. The majority of these dynasties rose in eastern China, and had greater or lesser levels of contact with and interest in the peoples and polities to the west, includ ing what is today known as Tibet. Writing systems first appear in Shang times, and some authorities believe that oracle bone inscriptions dating to ca. 1400 b.c. which describe the Qiang (Ch'iang) people are in fact making reference to inhabitants of the eastern fringes of the Tibetan plateau (Stein, 1972, p. 29). Whether this reference is actually specific to Tibetans, or one of many small ethnic groups and tribes that inhabited the western fringe of China, from Gansu southward through Sichuan and into Yunnan, is un known. Indeed, some authors note that while the Qiang are a recognized nationality within the Chinese state today, the term "Qiang" is a generic Han term for non-Han or is best read as a Han conceptualization of the "other" with a deep antiquity that reflects a distinction between a pastoral and an agricultural lifeway (Wang, 2002). What seems clear, however, is that the Chinese written record had no clear description of the agricul tural peoples of the central Tibetan plateau until much later in time, and most have concluded that the Qiang were ethnically and culturally distinct from Tibetans (Beckwith, 1987, p. 8). In fact, the first written reference by Chinese authors to central Tibet comes during Sui times with the recog nition of a pre-empire Tibetan king named Namri Songsten, who was the father of the first emperor of Tibet, Songsten Gampo (Snellgrove and Richardson, 1995, p. 26). Although few other written records of Chinese interest in Tibet can be found, there was considerable contact between Tibetan polities, such as they were, and the Han dynasty (206-209 b.c). The Han significantly</page><page sequence="41">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 41 expanded and eventually centralized the Chinese state, and established its capital at Ch'ang-an (Xi'an) in western China. Trade contacts with inner Asia were important, and the Han gained control of the lucrative Silk Road, which runs just along the northern fringes of the plateau eventually entering Gansu and continuing to the east. Small Tibetan polities in Qinghai (often described as "tribes" or "people') such as the Tibetan speaking Sumpa and Aza, undoubtedly benefited from participation in this trade. However, this gives little insight into what these polities might have been like socially and politically. Tibetan historical records written well after the spread of the empire and found at Dunhuang, a major religious and economic center along the Silk Road found at the very eastern margin of the Taklamakan desert, pro vide some insight into the immediately pre-empire polities of the plateau. Although these documents are known to be combinations of myth, legend, and history of highly doubtful veracity, as summarized by Haarh (1969) and others, the polities on the central Tibetan plateau were probably small-scale chiefly societies that inhabited the major river valleys and tributary streams of the Yarlung Tsangpo drainage (the region of central Tibet known to day as U-Tsang.) The term "clan" is often used to describe these groups, and these clans (or lineages) persisted as major political factors well after the establishment and fall of the empire. They held territory, and estab lished major strongholds on mountain peaks surrounding the river basins. Warfare was common, as was extensive alliance building. Political leader ship is characterized as a form of divine kingship, and religious practice is said to have been based upon shamanic ritual, which included the wor ship of local mountain deities and animal sacrifice (Samuel, 1993, pp. 438 444). Haarh (1969, p.128) notes that these historical sources indicate that one of these probably mythical rulers made contact with Indian Buddhism some five generations before the start of Songsten Gampo's reign, although the earliest known Buddhist constructions on the plateau are contempora neous with the establishment of the empire (Vitali, 1990). Economically, these polities were based upon the use of a full suite of animal and plant domesticates that was introduced onto the plateau during the Neolithic, but with the addition of the horse and goat, iron tools, and sophisti cated agricultural technologies, including small-scale irrigation systems and terracing. Unfortunately, there is almost no archaeological evidence of this pe riod in the central Tibetan plateau, and consequently, it is not possible to either examine the veracity of these reconstructions or track the transfor mations of these polities as they moved toward centralization by the mid seventh century. A large number of mortuary sites have been located on the central plateau, however, and while many of these have been excavated, few</page><page sequence="42">42 Aldenderfer and Zhang of them have been dated and systematically examined (Chayet, 1994, Huo, 1995; Xiage, 1998; pp. 76-89). Some of the best data on this long period are found, paradoxically, on the Chang Tang and in far western Tibet. Although little is known today beyond a handful of specialists, the Zhang zhung (also Shangshung or Zan Zun) polity once thrived in the high deserts of western Tibet between ca. 500 b.c. to a.d. 625. The origins and evolution of the polity are shrouded in mystery. Legends and fragmentary history speak of migrations of peo ples from the west into the homeland of Zhang zhung, but when these oc curred is unknown. The nature of the polity is debated: it has been var iously described as a small-scale coalition of territorially based linages, a kingdom (Petech, 1997, p. 230), a confederation (Beckwith, 1987, p. 14), a petty state (Tucci, 1956, p. 92), and an empire. Even the location of Zhang zhung has been disputed, with some authors arguing for a vast, nebulous polity that extended from western Tibet well into northeastern Tibet and beyond (Chung, 1960; Tucci, 1956). But aside from the myth, legend and apparent mystery, Zhang zhung played a major role in central Asian pre history and history. It appears to have acted as an important intermediary of trade and the diffusion of knowledge between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau, and for a time, was a significant political rival of the emerging Tibetan empire. It also acted as a filter of knowledge and cultural influences from the distant west, including Sogdiana, Persia, and the Hellenistic world (Stein, 1972). Perhaps of even greater importance was the sponsorship by Zhang zhung of Bon, a belief system thought by many to be the indigenous religion of much of the Tibetan plateau, and which had a profound influence of the development and evolution of Tibetan Buddhism. Some of the most interesting data on the pre-Buddhist, possibly Zhang zhung, occupation of western Tibet are those collected by Bellezza (2000, 2001, 2002) in a series of remarkable exploratory trips across the Chang Tang. During his more than a decade of research, he discovered almost 500 archaeological sites which he has placed into four major categories: fortresses (in what appear to be defensible locations), buildings (residen tial and religious), stela (or standing stones in a variety of configurations), and tombs. Using a combination of local myth and oral tradition, religious texts, and other data, he argues that most of these sites were founded in the period after ca. 1000 b.c but before the introduction of Buddhism to the northern plateau, which could not have occurred before the establish ment of the Tibetan empire in the seventh century a.d., and most probably after its "second diffusion" in the years following a.d. 1000. Unfortunately, Bellezza has no chronological control over these sites since he was unable to collect materials from them or excavate at them. While the majority</page><page sequence="43">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century a.d. 43 of these sites are likely to be pre-Buddhist, just when they fall into time and how they articulate within a settlement system is unknowable at this point. Further to the south, excavations at a number of pre-Buddhist sites have created an empirical basis for chronology in the region. These excavations are a part of a larger collaborative project between western and Chinese archaeologists designed to understand the second diffusion of Buddhism into far western Tibet (Aldenderfer, 2001a,b; Huo, 2002a, 2002b; Huo and Li, 2001). During that project, a village site?Dindun?was excavated (Aldenderfer, 2004a, in press; Aldenderfer and Moyes, 2004) as were two cemetery complexes, Gebusailu and Sasongtang (China Tibetol ogy Institute, Archaeology Department of Sichuan University and Bureau of Cultural Relics, Tibet Autonomous Region, 2001a,b). The village component consisted of at least 11 structures, of which three were fully excavated. The structures were semi-subterranean built with coursed stone on a rectangular plan (Fig. 14). Although the number of rooms varied, the placement of features was consistent in them, as was the material culture, which consisted of cord-marked and unslipped plainwares, animal bone (caprids and bovids), ground-stone tools, and metal scrap. The tombs vary in size, shape (circular and rectangular), and construction details (number of chambers, materials used). All, however, are excavated into the ground to varying depths, and one is a shaft tomb, unique in the archaeological record of this region. This tomb contained some scattered human remains, a disarticulated horse, a bronze dagger, small iron artifacts, and ceramics identical to those found at Dindun. Three radiocarbon dates have been run on the village and mortuary complex (2380 ? 80; 2310 ? 60; 2065 ? 60), and using the R-Combine function of Oxcal 3.8 (Bronk Ramsey, 2002), these calibrate into the most probable time frame of 400-100 b.c These dates place Dindun and the cemeteries within the putative range of Zhang zhung, but the data are clearly insufficient to say that Dindun represents the Zhang zhung archaeological culture. This will require far more systematic excavation at sites across the region. One of the structures at Dindun had a stela (or standing stone) in a small chamber within it. Two other standing stones were found at the east and west sides of the village (Aldenderfer, 2004a). Scattered across Tibet and the trans-Himalaya are literally thousands of standing stones of varied shapes and sizes, and which are found in a diversity of contexts that indi cate far more humble, but complex, uses than those devoted to the royal dynasties and their activities. Standing stones first became known to the west at the beginning of the twentieth century when the Tibetologist M. J. Bacot in 1907 described what he called a "megalith" observed in eastern Tibet (Macdonald, 1953, p. 64). Standing stones were subsequently reported</page><page sequence="44">44 Aldenderfer and Zhang 1 | Hearth I | Bench Fig. 14. Residential structure from Dindun, western Tibet. by Francke (1907, 1914) in both western Tibet and Poo in the Langchen Kebab (Sutlej) valley near a village called Dralang. He described them sim ply as "perpendicular stones," with one further labeled as a "lingam." Per haps the most important of these early descriptions of standing stones was made by Roerich (1930). During his Central Asiatic Expedition from 1925 to 1928 which explored what was then called Chinese Turkestan, the Altai, western Mongolia, and parts of northern and western Tibet, he discovered a number of archaeological sites with standing stones called by the locals rdo ring, but which Roerich (1930, p. 33) labeled menhirs, cromlechs, and align ments. One of these sites, known as Doring, had the remains of an impres sive alignment that combined 18 rows of smaller standing stones, a circle</page><page sequence="45">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century a.d. 45 of larger ones, and an arrow-shaped alignment pointing due west (Roerich, 1930, p. 16). Among the speculations he offered as an interpretation of this set of alignments were broad similarities of the Tibetan alignments with the megalithic cultures of western Europe, and the presence of the arrow as a reflection of the indigenous "nature cult," which he said included sun and fire worship, among other things. Elsewhere, he argued that a thorough examination of Bon manuscripts would help to create a context for under standing the function of these stones. Chinese archaeologists have examined standing stones as an aspect of mortuary practice and not specifically as an independent cultural man ifestation (Huo, 1995). Most of their research has been devoted to basic descriptions of alignments when encountered, and attempts to classify variation in them within this mortuary perspective. Bellezza (2001, 2002) has offered a number of potential explanations for their use: stone pillars in various combinations may have had at least four roles, including territorial markers, monuments of clans or chieftains, markers for mortuary sites, and shrines for the worship of indigenous deities. The roles of stelae and mono lithic alignments are interpreted through a lens of modern mythological beliefs, ranging from associations with the Gesar epic to persistent features of Bon, including boundary markers and religious symbols (Bellezza, 2001, pp. 34-38). Many of the stones discussed so far, indeed, the vast majority of those encountered by Roerich, Bellezza, and others on their expeditions, have strong affinities to the standing stones and megalithic monuments found all across north and central Asia and which date from the Bronze Age into historical times (Jacobsen-Tepfer et al, 2001). The earliest of these stand ing stones, which possibly date to the early Bronze Age (ca. 2000 b.c) are large megalithic constructions which are often elaborately carved; none of these are known from the Tibetan plateau. So-called "deer stones," often found singly as well as in small groups, tend to have images of deer or other animals or weapons carved upon their surfaces, and are frequently found within small rectangular enclosures. Uncarved examples are also known, and these bear a real resemblance to some of the larger standing stones seen on the Chang Tang. Those from Mongolia that can be dated by eval uation of the art motifs found upon them tend to fall into the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age (ca. 1000 b.c-a.d. 500). These general similarities between deer stone complexes and some Tibetan plateau standing stones offer a temptation to date those found on the Tibetan plateau to this antiq uity. While this is plausible, it must remain a hypothesis subject to further revision. The cultural affiliation of those who erected these stones are un known, and as before, it is premature to assign these stones to Zhang zhung people as has been done by some authors.</page><page sequence="46">46 Aldenderfer and Zhang The only known center of the Zhang zhung polity examined by any scholar is its putative capital, Kyunglung. The Tibetologist Giuseppe Tucci visited it in 1933 (Tucci, 1989, pp. 189-199), and he recorded a number of sacred and secular buildings as well as residential areas. A brief reconnais sance by archaeologists from the Chinese Institute of Tibetology has lo cated a number of mortuary sites in its vicinity. Kyunglung will be studied in detail over the next 5 years, and fundamental questions about its size, the nature of its settlement hierarchy, and dating, will be addressed. Even these highly limited findings suggest that numerous centers should be found across the plateau, especially in the central valleys. THE FUTURE OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN TIBET The most obvious remark we can make about the future of archaeol ogy in Tibet is that far more research of all kinds will be required before we can begin to address basic questions of broader anthropological con cern, such as the origins of settled village life and the evolution of more complex polities. Few sites of any time period have been systematically excavated, and chronological control is, as we have shown, quite limited and spotty. And since most of the research effort of Chinese archaeolo gists who work on the plateau is focused on the historical period, we do not expect rapid improvement of this situation. There is no question, how ever, that Chinese archaeologists and their Tibetan counterparts will con tinue their research. Their focus may change, however, since the central government has plans to significantly increase public spending and invest ment in western China, which includes Tibet, over the next decade. How much of this will directly benefit archaeological research is unclear since the stated goals of the investment program are to expand job opportu nities by creating factories, expanding the road network, and developing public works projects. Some rescue archaeology may result from this ex pansion. As an example, archaeologists from Sichuan University, Shaanxi Archaeological Institute, and the Bureau of Cultural Relics conducted a brief reconnaissance of the planned route of the Golmud-Lhasa rail line in 2002. We also expect the central government to continue its investment in historic preservation projects on the plateau. The Potala palace (po litical and spiritual seat of the Dalai Lamas), the Norbulingka (summer residence of the Dalai Lama), and Jokhang temple, all in Lhasa, are on the World Heritage list, and each has seen substantial renovation and restoration over the past decade. Numerous small and large monastic in stitutions and temples, such as Kumbum near Xining and Ganden near</page><page sequence="47">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 47 Lhasa across the plateau have seen restoration efforts. One obvious mo tivation for preservation is to enhance tourism as well as a genuine de sire to preserve at least some of the architectural foundations of Tibetan history. In contrast, massive urban renewal projects in both Lhasa and Shigatse have destroyed hundreds of traditional Tibetan structures (Larssen and Sinding Larsen, 2001). While there is no question that some of the oldest structures were unsafe and unsanitary and as such, required replacement or renovation, the scale of this process and especially its rapidity, is unsettling. A number of western organizations, such as the Tibet Heritage Fund (THF), worked for a time with authorities in Lhasa to develop a more comprehensive and rational development plan that would preserve the most outstanding traditional structures, but unfortunately, the THF was prevented from continuing this work in 2000. More recently a joint Norwegian-Tibet University-Lhasa and state authorities group has been attempting to develop a similar preservation plan, and has at a re cent conference had an archaeologist familiar with research in urban set tings attend (Amund Sinding Larsen, personal communication, September 2003). If the lessons learned from historic preservation apply to archaeology, the probability of a significant western presence in archaeology in the plateau appears to be slim. We believe, however, that the application of western style techniques and some cooperation with western archaeologists will be important. Although a number of areas on the plateau have been examined at least superficially, to date no western style systematic regional survey has ever been attempted. It is our belief that as Chinese universities and archaeological institutes foster more cooperative ventures with their western counterparts as they have in China itself, gaps of data in crucial areas of the plateau, such as in the central valleys of the Yarlung Tsangpo, will be filled in slowly. However, we also acknowledge that admittance of western archaeologists to the plateau is a political issue of some delicacy. Only one western archaeologist (Aldenderfer) has been authorized to work in the TAR, and we do not expect the plateau to open to large numbers of foreign archaeologists of any nationality in the foreseeable future. Cooperation will be limited to student exchanges, short-term training opportunities for Tibetan and Chinese archaeologists in the west and Asian universities, faculty and researcher exchanges and consultations, and museum-to-museum cooperative ventures. Although there are many data gaps that need filling, among the more important, at least to us, are the following: the question of the number and timing of migrations to the plateau needs some resolution. Although almost all scholars interested in the problem acknowledge that a very early (pre Homo sapiens) movement of people to the plateau is not likely, indeed,</page><page sequence="48">48 Aldenderfer and Zhang highly improbable (Aldenderfer, 2004b), there may well have been a num ber of migrations to the plateau over the past 50,000 b.p.. As we noted above, the most probable initial entry brings people from north Asia onto the plateau sometime around 25,000-30,000 b.p.. However, it remains possible that entry could have been achieved from the northwest at this time (or later, for that matter), and some have even speculated upon a route from the southwest up the Indus valley (Samuel, 2000). All of these are plausible, but at present lack any data by which they could be evaluated. The resolu tion of this question will involve not only new archaeological data, but more extensive analysis of Y haplotype, mtDNA, and other genetic data of mod ern Tibetans as well as the recovery of ancient DNA from human remains from multiple locations on the plateau. A closely related problem is the necessity to develop a more nuanced understanding of culture process on the plateau. Many reconstructions of Tibetan prehistory take an explicitly diffusionist stance, and posit that peo ple, innovations, and fundamental aspects of subsistence practice, political institutions, and cultural forms diffused onto the plateau from external, of ten low elevation, sources. Such reconstructions ignore the reality of hy poxia and the constraints it places upon human behavior, and often dis count environmental conditions, such as extreme aridity or cold, that would mitigate against the successful establishment of plant cultivation. Further, many of these diffusions are thought to have originated from far away places, such as the Middle East. Although it is now well known that very large-scale movements of people criss-crossed the central and east Asia in prehistory, it is not wise to assume that these movements necessarily influ enced the plateau and were responsible for the development of complexity or any other cultural formation found upon it. There is no question that many items of material culture and subsistence staples in common use on the plateau did not originate there, such as bronze and iron tools and do mesticates like barley, millet, horse, and pig. However, these models rou tinely ignore the context of diffusion, and simply assume a demic "spread" model for their appearance on the plateau. It is apparent that there may well have been "indigenous" people present on the plateau when many of these diffusions took place, and models that describe potential interactions are urgently needed. We have barely begun to understand the basic outlines of the prehis tory of the Tibetan plateau, but if this review of what has been accomplished by Chinese and western archeologists over the past 30 years is any indica tion, we can look forward to continued discoveries that can only be en hanced by the attempt to place these discoveries in a broader Asian con text, which will permit not only historical research, but also investigation of major questions of anthropological concern.</page><page sequence="49">The Prehistory of the Tibetan Plateau to the Seventh Century A.D. 49 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Aldenderfer is grateful to the Tibetan Bureau of Cultura Relics, as well as the national Bureau of Cultural Relics, Ministry of Culture, People's Republic of China, for the opportunity to work in the Tibet Autonomous Region. His coworkers at Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan?Huo Wei and Li Yongxian?have been the best of colleagues, and have served as his teachers in what is known of Tibetan archaeology. We have also ben efited from discussions with Tang Hui-Sheng and Xu Xingwuo on differ ent aspects of Tibetan archaeology. Amy Heller of Nyon, Switzerland, has provided us with useful information, and has led me through the complex ities of the historical literature of Tibet. Holley Moyes prepared the maps, and worked with Aldenderfer in the field in western Tibet in 2001, and has been a major source of inspiration and sound critique. Cynthia Beall has offered good advice on how to interpret genetic relationships of Tibetans and other east Asian populations, and has also given us real insight into un derstanding the physiological complexities of life at high elevation. Thanks are also due to John Olsen and P. Jeffrey Brantingham who reviewed the manuscript and offered a number of helpful suggestions. Financial assis tance for our research in Tibet has been provided by a donor who wishes to remain anonymous, and who has loved Tibet and the Tibetan people for more than three decades. We are profoundly in his debt for making this dream come true. All errors of interpretation and omission are ours alone. REFERENCES Aldenderfer, M. (1998).
