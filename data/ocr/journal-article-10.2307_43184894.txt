<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CONTEXTUAL AND ICONOGRAPHIC REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 Bretton T. Giles I explore in this paper the significance of the headdress interred on Burial 11 under Hopewell Mound 25 by reexamining its archaeological context and the history of its interpretation. Following Shetrone's (1926) initial interpretation , I argue that it was an avian headdress that specifically portrayed a two-headed raptor. I support this reassessment with an iconographie analysis of related representations from the Central Ohio River Valley , especially the imagery engraved on a femur from Hopewell Mound 25.1 also delve into what these two-headed raptors might have meant to people in the Eastern Woodlands. Con el fin de determinar su importancia, el presente estudio examina la historia y el contexto de los tocados encontrados en el entierro 11 del túmulo Hopewell 25. Basándome en la interpretación inicial de Shetrone (1926), propongo que uno de estos tocados representa una ave raptora de dos cabezas. Esta interpretación se fundamenta no sólo en este tocado, sino también en en el análisis iconográfico de otras representaciones que provienen del Valle Central del Rio Ohio. Entre ellas destaca la imagen en bajo relieve tallada en un femur del Túmulo Hopewell 25. El presente estudio indaga además en el posible signi- ficado que estos motivos de pájaros de dos cabezas pueden haber tenido para los grupos del Woodland Oriental. Sometime excavated wearing a in a very richly 1924 elaborate or endowed 1925, Henry headdress burial Shetrone that (i.e., was Sometime excavated a richly endowed burial that was wearing a very elaborate headdress (i.e., Hopewell Burial 11) and interred under Hopewell Mound 25. Shetrone (1926:68-72, 178) argued that it was an avian headdress because he found abundant feathers and the heads of two small rap- torial birds attached to it. While Charles Willoughby's (1935) subsequent interpretation supplanted this interpretation, I contend that Shetrone's (1926:68-72) initial characterization of the headdress was essentially correct, but that it more specifically represented a two-headed raptor. I develop this argument by reassessing Shetrone's (1926) original descriptions of the headdress in comparison to the evidence employed by Willoughby (1935) and others (cf. Carr 2008; Gre- ber and Ruhl 1989:277). In particular, I describe how Willoughby (1935) connected this headdress to the imagery engraved on a human or bear femur (see Johnston 2002). I assert that Willoughby's (1935) interpretation of both symbols is flawed and demonstrate that there is a double-headed raptor depicted on this femur. I discuss how these two-headed raptors are related to particular other symbols from the Central Ohio River Valley (CORV). I conclude by exploring what these two- headed raptors might have meant and their conti- nuity with subsequent visual lexicons. The Hopewell Horizon Hopewell societies are often remembered for their large mounds, earthworks, elaborate burials, and provocative symbols. This perspective derives in part from the mid-nineteenth century excavations of large Middle Woodland mound complexes in the CORV. It resulted in designating the Hopewell site as the archetype for the Middle Woodland pe- riod (Brown 2004; Greber 1991). Emerson Green- man (1932) then employed Adena as the type site for the preceding Early Woodland period. The current context of these two taxonomie units is a study in contrasts. While Berle Clay (2005:108) has stated "read my lips: Adena does not exist," work on Hopewell has accelerated, marked by the Bretton T.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the Early to Middle Woodland sequence in the CORV, the location of the archetypical Adena and Hopewell sites, re- mains troublesome because there is little consen- sus about the archaeological materials that are temporally sensitive in different river valleys (Brown 2004, 2005; Clay 2005, 2009; Greber 1991; Mainfort 2005). The use of Adena and Hopewell as broad taxa is also associated with the assumption that the lifeways of these peoples changed at a constant rate (cf. Seeman 1992). Consequently, Adena sites are assumed to date to the Early Woodland period, before Hopewell sites that were constructed during the Middle Wood- land period. However, radiocarbon assays suggest that many sites in the Lower Hocking River Val- ley, the Kentucky Bluegrass Region, and the Muskingham River Valley that have been classi- fied as Adena date to the Middle Woodland period (Abrams 2009; Abrams and Freter 2005; Carskad- den and Morton 1996; Clay 2009; Cochran 1996; Greber 1991; Murphy 1989; Railey 1996; Seeman 1996). It would therefore be useful to develop an alternate nomenclature to refer to different re- gional clusters of Middle Woodland sites, which were formerly known as Adena. The temporal separation of Adena and Hopewell sites has also been reified by icono- graphie analyses. For example, Christopher Carr and Troy Case (2005b) have argued that there is a developmental sequence from Adena to Hopewell imagery. They contend that the earlier Adena tablets depict "classic" shamanistic themes, while Hopewell imagery represents the development of a more formalized religious tradition. However, Carr and Case (2005b: 202) imply some overlap because both Adena and Hopewell imagery em- ploy "perceptual-mental ambiguities" ( sensu Roe 1995). They argue that these "perceptual-mental ambiguities" indicate the pervasiveness of shamanistic themes that stress transformation. Yet Carr and his colleagues do not define any shared Adena and Hopewell iconographie themes, al- though they note similarities in the structure and techniques used in these groups' imagery (Carr 2008; Carr and Case 2005b).1 I argue that the depiction of two-headed raptors constitutes a shared iconographie theme. While double-headed raptors, especially the examples depicted on tablets, have often been considered characteristic of Adena representations (Webb and Baby 1957), the importance of this theme at the Hopewell site has been obscured by Willoughby's (1916, 1935) interpretations of the headdress interred on Burial 1 1 and the engraved femur found with either Burial 28 1 or 260/261 in Hopewell Mound 25 (Greber and Ruhl 1989). 2 Archaeological Context of Shetrone's Burial 11 from Hopewell Mound 25 Hopewell is a massive site composed of four en- closures and at least 40 mounds located on the North Fork of Paint Creek (Figure 1). The forty mounds range in size from several that were 3 m in diameter and 30 cm high to the massive Hopewell Mound 25 (Greber and Ruhl 1989; Moorehead 1922; Shetrone 1926; Squier and Davis 1998 [1848]). Hopewell Mound 25 was originally probably about 33 ft (10 m) high, 500 ft (152 m) in length, and 180 ft (55 m) wide be- fore it was extensively plowed. Hopewell Mound 25 probably covered several wooden charnel houses (Greber and Ruhl 1989). The wide range of radiocarbon dates from Hopewell Mound 25 indicates that the space was used over an ex- tended period (Greber 2003). Scioto peoples interred Burial 11 wearing an elaborate headdress that consisted of a number of different components (Shetrone 1926: 68-72, 178). Cheryl Johnston (2008:499, Table 10.5) es- timates that this individual was a 20-30-year-old male. Yet despite his youth, he received an elab- orate interment at Hopewell, given the headdress and objects interred with him, some of which may indicate membership or leadership in partic- ular Ohio Hopewell sodalities (Carr 2008:69). Copper earspools were placed on both his ears and two were positioned near his left hand,3 while six bear incisors were set in his right hand. Bracelets of shell beads encircled his neck and wrists. Four large bear canines were found around his neck, two of which were cut and had a mitered joint set with a pearl. Hopewell peoples placed a large conch shell in the left center of the grave, two copper plates at the right center, and eight</page><page sequence="3">504 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 201 3 Figure 1.

Burial 1 1 was also interred in a log crypt approximately 10 ft (3 m) long by 6 ft (1.8 m) wide that was placed on a low earthen platform. His grave was capped by a small mound and later covered by Hopewell Mound 25 (Shetrone 1926:68-72). His headdress consisted of a rectangular copper headplate with large, oval copper flaps on either side that was assembled on a saucer-shaped wooden base (Figure 2.1). It was attached to a bon- net-like appendage of fabric to which large pearl beads*, bear claws, bird feathers, and the heads of two small raptoral birds had been sewn (Shetrone 1926:68-72, 178). There have been a series of notable interpretations of Burial 1 1 from Hopewell Mound 25 that have emphasized the significance of this headdress (Carr 2008; Greber and Ruhl 1989; Willoughby 1935; Shetrone 1926). Willoughby's 1935 paper has been the most in- fluential interpretation and suggests that the head- dress was a representation of Michabo the Great Hare, a mythic Algonquian hero, with the copper flaps of this headdress portraying the floppy ears of a rabbit/hare. Additionally, Willoughby (1935) associated the headdress on Burial 1 1 with the de- sign engraved on the femur (Figure 2.2). Since in- terpretations of Burial 11 's headdress rely on Willoughby's (1935) analyses, it is instructive to review the historical development and limitations of his work. Willoughby's perspective developed from analyzing the collections from the Hopewell site, which were the result of Moorehead's (1897, 1922) late nineteenth-century excavations. He conducted these analyses under the direction of Frederick Putnam, and they published an abstract on moundbuilder art (Putnam and Willoughby 1896). In fact, even though Shetrone found Bur-</page><page sequence="4">Giles] REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 505 Figure 2. Comparison of the headdress interred on Shetrone's (1926) Burial 11 from Hopewell Mound 25 to the imagery engraved on a femur that Moorehead (1922) found in the same mound: (2.1) copper, pearl, and mica headdress found on Burial 11 under Hopewell Mound 25 (Image Courtesy of the Ohio Historical Society); (22) design engraved on a femur from Hopewell Mound 25 (Putnam and Willoughby 1893:303, Figure 2); (23) visages produced by Willoughby in the 1890s from the design on the femur (Putnam and Willoughby 1896:304, Figure 3).</page><page sequence="5">506 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 ial 11 in the 1920s, Willoughby's interpretation of its headdress began gestating approximately thirty years earlier as a result of his analysis of an en- graved femur (Figure 2.2) from Hopewell. Willoughby's (1916, 1935; see also Greber and Ruhl 1989; Putnam and Willoughby 1896) critical insight was that this engraved femur de- picted many of the "masks" (e.g., headdresses and ceremonial regalia) found with burials and in ritual deposits under Hopewell Mound 25. Willoughby recognized in even his earliest work in the 1890s that the imagery it depicted (Figure 2.3a-e) visually referenced the copper, antlered headdresses that Moorehead (1922) found with burials. Later Willoughby (1935) linked the head- dress on Shetrone's Burial 1 1 to one of the visages he had produced from the design incised on this femur approximately 40 years earlier (Figure 2.3e) (cf. Putnam and Willoughby 1896; Willoughby 1916; Willoughby 1935). He argued that the floppy "ears" (e.g., copper flaps) on either side of the heads of these individuals represented those of rabbits and that this visage portrayed the Algonquin hero "Michabo the Great Hare." Willoughby (1935:285) brushed aside aspects of the headdress's context by stating that "the pearl beads, bear claws, feathers, and the head of a small hawk-like bird had, apparently , been used in or- namenting the woven fabric which, according to Mr. Shetrone, had apparently formed a part of the headpiece" (emphasis added). So Willoughby (1935) casts doubt on Shetrone's (1926) description of the headdress and dismisses aspects of its ar- chaeological context. This is because Willoughby already had a visual image with which he associ- ated the headdress. In fact, Willoughby (in Greber and Ruhl 1989:251) stated in regard to this en- graved femur "that of course other combinations can be made from this ingenious design but I have only reproduced the heads and faces which were evidently in the primitive artist's mind when he ex- ecuted this remarkable carving." Willoughby pri- oritized his own interpretations and did not reeval- uate them based on the contextual evidence associated with Burial 11 . Subsequent interpretations were inordinately influenced by Willoughby's (1935) paper. For ex- ample, N'omi Greber and Katherine Ruhl (1989:277) suggest that the proportions of the "ears" depicted are more akin to those of a deer than a rabbit. In fact, in order to support inter- preting these flaps as deer's ears, Amelia Trevelyan (2004) depicted the copper flaps as pointing up, rather than how they were originally oriented along the sides of the head of Burial 11 . Carr (2008:187-188) has also made a passing al- lusion to the headdress on Burial 11 from Hopewell Mound 25 as representing "a shimmer- ing flying creature (insect?, cicada?, or hum- mingbird?)," while acknowledging that they might also be a deer's ears. Carr's (2008:187-188) in- terpretation references the shiny or bright copper and mica in this headdress, especially the parts cu- rated at the Ohio Historical Society. Regrettably, Carr (2008) overlooks that Shetrone (1926:178) found feathers and the heads of two small raptors with the headdress. Ohio Hopewell archaeologists, in general, seem to have forgotten that Shetrone (1926:178) inter- preted the ceremonial regalia on Burial 1 1 as a rap- torial headdress. Shetrone (1926:68-72, 175-178) even talked about how well preserved the "vestiges of the feathers and the beaks of two birds, apparently small hawks" were, as well as the way its copper flaps served as wings. The fact that Shetrone's in- terpretation of Burial 1 1 was virtually never cited af- ter Willoughby's (1935) paper was published illus- trates how completely it was supplanted. I argue that there is a two-headed raptor em- bedded in the design, engraved on the femur from Hopewell Mound 25 (cf. Greber and Ruhl 1989; Putnam and Willoughby 1896; Willoughby 1916, 1935). While this two-headed raptor has not been recognized, once identified, it ameliorates a great deal of the confusion regarding the significance of the headdress on Burial 1 1 . The beaks of the dou- bled-head raptor are formed by three curved lines, one of which is shorter than the others (Figure 3a), which attach to the central circular eyes of the de- sign (Figure 3b). The body of the bird is formed by a long axial element (Figure 3c) that expands into a fan-shaped motif that probably portrays its tail feathers (Figure 3d).4 The wings of the bird cor- respond to the appendages located on either side of the design that parallel the copper flaps of the headdress on Burial 1 1 (Figure 3e). There also ap- pears to be a possibly anthropomorphic face rep- resented in profile on these wings (Figure 3f). The two-headed raptor in the design is im- plicitly portrayed superimposed on a human face.</page><page sequence="6">Giles] REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 507 Figure 3.

This human face is recognizable by the presence of a mouth with square teeth within it (Figure 3g). This human face probably prompted Willoughby (1916, 1935) and others (Greber and Ruhl 1989) to interpret these headdresses and ceremonial re- galia as "masks." But it might be more appropri- ate to conceptualize this iconographie imagery as reflecting complex visual puns, since both the human face and the two-headed raptor share the same large circular eyes (Figure 3b) (Giles 2010). This use of visual puns probably points to a closely related emphasis on transformation (see Carr 2008; Carr and Case 2005b; Giles 2010). This association was maintained in the interment of Burial 1 1 because the two-headed raptorial headdress was placed on the aforementioned man's head. These two-headed raptor icons have counterparts in other Early-Middle Woodland de- pictions from the CORV. A Comparison of Two-Headed Raptor Depictions from the CORV The recognition that Burial ITs headdress and the engraved femur from Hopewell Mound 25 repre- sent two-headed raptors offers an opportunity to assess whether they have connections to other icons from the CORV. While a discussion of all the similarities between representations of double- headed raptors in the CORV is beyond the purview of this paper, I will discuss how five icons (the Low Tablet, three copper cutouts from Burial 2 under Mound City Mound 13, and the Crab Orchard Shell Gorget) have unrecognized similarities to the two aforementioned examples from Hopewell. One representation that has close iconographie similarities to the two-headed raptors from Hopewell Mound 25 is the Low Tablet, which was found by an amateur archaeologist in a small mound in northern West Virginia (Figure 4.1) (Otto 1975; Penney 1982). The Low tablet is in- scribed with two sets of double-headed raptors (Figure 4.1a) that are positioned above the two centralized human faces (Figure 4.1b), which are surrounded on either side by wings (Figure 4.1c). These birds have long curved beaks and rounded heads, which have been interpreted as represent- ing vultures, similar to several of the other en- graved tablets (Webb and Baby 1957; Webb and Snow 2001 [1945]). Below these designs, there are stylized feet, talons, or plumes (Figure 4.1d). The imagery on the Low Tablet therefore parallels the depiction of a two-headed bird overlaid on a hu-</page><page sequence="7">508 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 201 3 Figure 4. Comparison of the Low Tablet to a rectangular copper plate and copper two-headed bird cutout from Mound City: (4.1) sketch of the Low Tablet: (a) two-headed birds with hook-like beaks and bulbous heads; (b) two central human faces; (c) conventionalized wings; (d) stylized feet, talons, or plumes; (42) tracing of the rectangular copper plate from Grave 12 under Mound 13 at Mound City (after Webb and Baby 1957:101, Figure 49); (43) two-headed bird cop- per cutout from Burial 2 under Mound 7 at Mound City: (a) hook-like beaks on this two-headed bird; (b) bulbous heads of this bird. man face from the aforementioned engraved fe- mur, as well as Burial 1 1 . There are some differences between the im- ages portrayed on the Low Tablet and on the en- graved femur from Hopewell Mound 25. For ex- ample, it is notable that instead of one human face, as appears on the engraved femur from Hopewell, the Low Tablet features two sets that generally mirror one another. This difference is probably meaningful, but it does not undermine their similarities. Along these lines, the configu- ration of the Low Tablet is similar to how two sets of double-headed raptors are portrayed on a re- poussé plate interred with Burial 2 under Mound 7 at Mound City (Figure 4.2). Despite these differences, the images inscribed on the Low Tablet and the Hopewell femur have a striking resemblance. Is this resemblance be- cause one of the artisans was familiar with an ex- isting design and produced an iterative depiction based on it? I believe this scenario is possible, but it is also feasible that one or both of the artisans produced these representations by depicting ritual specialists who wore regalia similar to the illus- trated examples. For example, we know from Willoughby's (1916; see also Greber and Ruhl 1989; Putnam and Willoughby 1896) work on the engraved femur from Hopewell Mound 25 that it depicts other ceremonial regalia that were probably also worn as costumes. The depiction of a double-headed bird headdress on the Low Tablet certainly could have been the example interred on Burial 1 1 under Hopewell Mound 25, although it is equally possible that it represented an analo- gous example. The convention of depicting double-headed raptors around the human face may hold impli- cations for how the three copper cutouts found in Burial 2 under Mound 13 at Mound City were worn (Figure 4.3). These three copper cutouts portray stylized double-headed raptors with long, hooked beaks (Figure 4.3a) that are very similar to those depicted on several of the engraved tablets, including the Low Tablet (Figure 4.1a).</page><page sequence="8">Giles] REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 509 Figure 5. Sketch of the Crabb Orchard Shell Gorget (based on Young 1910:240): (a) hook-like beaks of this two-headed bird; (b) crest of these bird heads, similar to the caracara; (c) circular eye of the visage in profile on the wing of this bird; (d) curved lobe-shaped motifs at the bottom of these wings, similar to the wings of the two-headed raptor engraved on the femur from Hopewell Mound 25; (e) teardrop-shaped elements similar to ones that appear on the wings of the two- headed raptor engraved on the femur from Hopewell Mound 25. These hook-like beaks and rounded, bulbous heads (Figure 4.3b) have been taken to indicate that these copper cutouts, like the Adena tablets, portray vultures (Webb and Baby 1957). Conse- quently, these three copper cutouts from Mound City provide an apropos link between the more falconoid imagery from Hopewell sites and the vulture-like representations depicted on several tablets. These beaks are also visible on the rec- tangular copper plate found with Burial 2 under Mound 7 at Mound City (Figure 4.2). The Crab Orchard Shell Gorget (Figure 5) is another representation from the CORV that has iconographie similarities with the two-headed raptor engraved on the femur from Hopewell Mound 25. It was found with a burial in a mound in southern Kentucky near Crab Orchard Springs (Webb and Baby 1957; Young 1910). A double- headed raptor or eagle, with stylized faces por- trayed in profile on its wings, is engraved on its surface (Phillips and Brown 1978; Webb and Baby 1957; Young 1910). While Webb and Baby (1957:94, 107) attributed this large shell gorget to Adena, Phillips and Brown (1978) argued that it was a member of the late Middle Woodland Fair- field group of shell gorgets, based on the absence of other comparable examples from Adena sites and its stylistic and morphological similarities to the rest of the group. In this sense, it is notable that Mills (1922:434, 557-558) found a cache of shell gorgets with Burial 2 under Mound 8 at Mound City, one of which depicted a stylized bird head. The design on the Crab Orchard Springs Shell Gorget is similar to a number of the aforemen- tioned double-headed raptorial images, which suggests that Phillips and Brown (1978) were correct to attribute it to the Middle Woodland pe- riod. For example, it clearly portrays a double- headed raptor that has long hook-like beaks (Fig- ure 5a) similar to those illustrated on the copper cutouts from Mound City (Figure 4.3a) and on several engraved tablets.5 However, the crests on</page><page sequence="9">51 0 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 these raptor heads (Figure 5b) are not comparable to any motif on the other representations (cf. Fig- ure 4.1a and 4.2 to Figure 5b). The crests on these bird heads could be drawn from caracaras, which have pronounced black crests on their heads and a semitropical distribution that includes Texas. Yet there are features on this depiction that do not fit the morphology of the crested caracara, such as the fairly narrow, hook-like beak; caracara have large, thick, prominent beaks that almost jut out from their foreheads. So it is feasible that the Crab Orchard Springs Shell Gorget may portray an avian creature with various stylized features, which was part of the mythos of Middle Wood- land people in the CORV. Moreover, the design on the Crab Orchard Springs Gorget lacks the human head(s) depicted in several of the other represen- tations that could indicate that they illustrate elab- orate headdresses. The shared talons, body, and tail feathers on the Crab Orchard Springs Gorget also indicate a mythic figure (e.g., a raptorial bird with two heads) more clearly than the Low Tablet and femur from Hopewell Mound 25. The two-headed raptor on the Crab Orchard Shell Gorget does share a number of important features with Hopewell representations, espe- cially the femur from Hopewell Mound 25. In particular, the faces depicted in profile on this double-headed raptor's wings are similar to those present in an analogous position on the engraved femur. In fact, there are similarities between the wings on the two-headed raptors for the Crab Or- chard Shell Gorget and the engraved femur from Hopewell Mound 25 that extend to the shape, position, and presence of the particular motifs. For example, both of these double-headed raptors have circular motifs on their wings that appear to portray eyes (cf. Figures 3f and 5c), curved lobe shaped motifs at the bottom of their wings (cf. Figures 3h and 5d), and teardrop shaped elements that are located in roughly analogous positions (cf. Figures 3i and 5e). I therefore agree with Phillips and Brown (1978:158-159) that the Crab Or- chard Springs Gorget should be included in the Fairfield style of shell gorgets. Collectively, the similarities between these Middle Woodland double-headed raptor repre- sentations from Ohio, West Virginia, and Ken- tucky suggest that this imagery constitutes a wide- spread, shared iconographie theme. The overlapping iconographie imagery found at Mid- dle Woodland sites, traditionally labeled as Hopewell and Adena, suggests a complex politi- cal and social landscape in which spatial prox- imity in the CORV did not have a straightforward or simplistic relation with similarity/difference. Likewise, the absence of representations of dou- ble-headed raptors at Seip, Liberty, and Turner is itself notable. Their absence highlights David Brose's (1985) point that there are notable dis- continuities in Hopewell exchange patterns, which suggest sporadic, fluid, and contingent in- teractions between different communities. Based on the distribution of these two-headed raptor images, it would appear that there were im- portant relationships between the Ohio Hopewell groups that claimed Hopewell and Mound City and certain Middle Woodland folk from northern West Virginia and Kentucky.6 These relationships may also be indicated by other types of artifacts (Applegate 2008). For example, Squier and Davis (1998 [1848]) documented four engraved sand- stone rattlesnake tablets from Hopewell Mound 1 , objects that often seem to have been ignored in discussions of this artifact type in the CORV (cf. Penney 1980, 1982). Given that two snake effigy platform pipes were also found in Hopewell Mound 1 (Giles 2010:348; Stevens 1870), 7 this mound most likely dates to the Middle Woodland period, although it could be early in the sequence analogous to the dates for the large pipe caches under Mound 8 at Mound City and the Tremper Mound (Brown 2004; Emerson et al. 2005). It is therefore important that Hopewell is the only Ohio Hopewell site with engraved tablets, which could indicate this group's relationship with par- ticular Middle Woodland peoples from northern West Virginia and Kentucky. Moreover, the con- ceptually similar rectangular repoussé and fenes- trated copper plates, found with Burial 2 under Mound 7 at Mound City (Figure 4.2), may indi- cate a similar axis of interaction. There are other interesting connections as well. For example, there are morphological similarities between the Crab Orchard Shell Gorget and the cache of shell gorgets interred in Mound City Mound 8, while there are no other comparable shell gorgets found in Early or Middle Woodland contexts in Kentucky (Phillips and Brown 1978). Similarly, Burial 11 from Hopewell Mound 25</page><page sequence="10">Giles] REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 51 1 was found with a series of bone awls, and bone awls are sometimes associated with whetstones in the CORV, such as within the Adena mound (Mills 1902:470-471). Martha Otto (1985), among others, has suggested that the grooves on stone tablets from the CORV are the result of sharpening these bone awls, which were then dipped in the pigments often found with these tablets and used in tattooing.8 The deposition of eight deer bone awls in the lower left corner of Burial II's tomb may therefore be significant. For instance, it is possible to envision a scenario in which these bone awls were offered as "gifts" by a Middle Woodland group from northern West Virginia or Kentucky to mark the passing of this important man. Alternately, this individual (Bur- ial 11) could have been connected to tattooing as a specialized activity in the CORV.9 One way or another, it is time to break up and "deconstruct" the pervasive notion that the CORV was com- posed of bounded, culturally homogeneous social groups during the Middle Woodland period by looking for interesting convergences across the re- gion (Brown 2005; Clay 2005, 2009; Mainfort 2005; Sieg and Hollinger 2005). The Meaning and Significance of Double-Headed Raptors Depictions of double-headed raptors occur over a long period in the Eastern Woodlands and a broad geographic range. Penney (1985:183) has argued that the earliest two-headed bird was engraved on a Poverty Point era plummet from the Lower Mississippi River Valley. During the Middle Woodland period, representations of double- headed birds occur on pots from the Lower Mis- sissippi River Valley and Illinois River Valleys (Giles 2009; Kidder 2004). A double-headed rap- tor is portrayed on the copper cutout found in Bedford Mound 8 with Burial 1 (Hall 2006; Perino and Farnsworth 2006:252). There are also representations of double-headed birds depicted on pipes, stone tablets, copper plates and cere- monial regalia from the CORV, including some of the aforementioned examples (Giles 2009; 2010). It is possible that some of the two-headed bird de- pictions engraved on stone tablets from the CORV could date to the Early Woodland period, but it is difficult to assess this possibility with the current evidence (cf. Penney 1982; Webb and Baby 1957; Webb and Snow 2001 [1945]). Two-headed birds continued to be portrayed after the Middle Woodland period, although the distribution of these symbols no longer seems to have included the CORV. From the Late Wood- land period, there is a double-headed falcon shell pendant from the Liverpool Lake site in Illinois and a mussel shell effigy from the Maurice Thompson Mound in Illinois (Sank and Sampson 1994). Later, Mississippian people portrayed dou- ble-headed birds in many of the same material media as earlier Hopewellian people, such as on pots, shell cups, shell gorgets, and copper plates (Phillips and Brown 1978; Sank and Sampson 1994). Robert Hall (2006:467) documented a Pawnee two-headed eagle war charm, while War- ren Wittry (1962) described a two-headed raven headdress that was found on a burial in a mound in Sauk County, Wisconsin. So while double- headed bird representations are rare, they have a long history in the Eastern Woodlands that ex- tends into the historic period, since the Pawnee war charm is "perhaps a century and a half old at most" (Hall 2006:466). The similarities between the two-headed raven headdress that Wittry (1962) describes and the ex- ample on Burial 1 1 from Hopewell Mound 25 are particularly noteworthy. This headdress, made from the heads and feathers of two common ravens, was interred on a subadult in a conical mound with a circular ditch. The braincases of each of these two birds were removed, and the raven heads were perforated for attachment to the headdress (Wittry 1962:91-92). This two- headed raven headdress is conceptually quite sim- ilar to the composite copper, mica, and raptorial headdress interred on Burial 11 in Hopewell Mound 25. Yet its date is unclear and Wittry (1962) suggests that it falls within the Late Wood- land to Precontact period. Nevertheless, these headdresses seem analogous to the regalia de- scribed by James Howard (1968:44) as consisting of a split hawk's skin that was worn as a turban with the bird's head positioned in front, the wings along the sides of the wearer's head, and the tail feathers draped over their neck. The ethnohistoric literature is strangely quiet about the meaning of double-headed raptors. How- ever, James Duncan (2011:22) has recently de-</page><page sequence="11">51 2 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 scribed the importance of a two-headed eagle in Osage cosmology, where it is associated with the first or primal being (Ho^ga A-hui-to^) , who is also referred to as a "young mottled eagle." Duncan (2011:22) states that this two-headed eagle "rep- resents the risen sun and its red color is an allusion to the rays reflecting from the mottled eagle's body," which is a pertinent association because this imagery was often portrayed in copper or with copper embellishments. The Osage consider Ho*- ga A-hui-toq,s two eagle heads to "illustrate its dual female/male nature, the all powerful spirit re- siding within its body" (Duncan 2011:22). More- over, the associations of Hoq-ga A-hui-toq are com- plicated because he and then his sons serially assume several roles linked to the sun and morning star (Brown 2007:93-95; Duncan 2011:26). One of Duncan's (2011) entry points into this double-headed eagle is the cosmogram presented to J. Owen Dorsey in 1883 by William Matthews (Red Corn), a member of the Osage (cf. Dorsey 1885:377-378). Moreover, Dorsey's cosmogram corresponds to a modern chart that is a transcrip- tion of the Tsi-Zhu tattoo that was provided to Duncan (201 1 : 19) by Bud Red Corn (Figure 6.1). Bud Red Corn identifies this two-headed raptor, Ho^-ga A-hui-to^, at the top of the Dorsey's cos- mogram and the Tsi-Zhu tattoo (in Duncan 2011:22). Tsi-Zhu is the name of the Dhegihan "Sky" moiety (Bailey and La Flesche 1995:41), but this tattoo is described as adorning the upper chest of the "Man of Mystery." It is clear from other sources that this "Man of Mystery" stood for "the unification of the two great tribal divisions, representative of the sky with its cosmic bodies and the Earth, the earth into which life descends to take on bodily forms" (Bailey and La Flesche 1995: 137). In other words, he represented an im- portant microcosm for the larger cosmos. The Tsi-Zhu tattoo has a series of very inter- esting concurrences with two-headed raptor rep- resentations from the Hopewell site and the broader CORV. First, there is the possibility that representations of double-headed raptors are con- sistently associated with tattooing, since Otto (1975) and Lepper (2005) suggest that the en- graved stone tablets, pigments, and sharpened bone awls composed tattooing kits. Several of the engraved tablets also portray two-headed rap- tors, including the Low, Meigs, and Wilmington Tablets. Furthermore, there are the eight deer bone awls, which could have possibly been used in tattooing, that were found in the lower left cor- ner of Burial II's tomb (Shetrone 1926:68). Ac- cordingly, Aaron Deter- Wolf (2009) has suggested that sharpened bone awls were the most likely prehistoric implements to be used in tattooing. The second similarity is the portrayal of these double-headed raptors as part of cosmograms (Figure 6.1a), although the information conveyed in the designs is quite different. In many ways, cosmological knowledge is presented in a much more straightforward manner on the Tsi-Zhu tat- too because it depicts the number of cosmologi- cal levels, which sit or pivot on the world tree (Duncan 201 1) (Figure 6.1b and c). Other parts of the design also convey information about signif- icant other-than-human persons or allude to im- portant events (Duncan 20 1 1 ) . Similarly, the design on the engraved femur from Hopewell Mound 25 contains significant cosmological knowledge (Figure 6.2) (Giles 2010:58-59). For example, it depicts a stacked cosmos as well, with a circular motif (Figure 6.2a) that may represent a celestial orb above the human head (Figure 6.2b). The human head has antlers on it (Figure 6.2c), and on his face is a two-headed raptor (Figure 6.2d) (Giles 2010). This spatial or- der may be apropos, since it includes mythic and other noteworthy animals. Along these lines, it could portray the branching antlers of an elk or wapiti, which extended higher than the heads of most human beings. 10 In addition, celestial orbs, such as the sun and the moon, rotate in the sky above our heads, which establishes an important similarity between these cosmograms (cf. 6.1 and 6.2). Other parts of this design, such as the double- headed raptor on the human face, may also have a spatial logic that visually puns or plays on their relative position in the cosmos (see below). This Ohio Hopewell design therefore seems to con- dense a perspective of the cosmos that emphasizes aspects of different human/animal bodies (Giles 2010:558-559). Third, these cosmograms with two-headed rap- tors are portrayed on human (possibly men's) bod- ies, while some of the other ceremonial objects, such as the copper cutouts, were probably also worn. Along these lines, Charles Hudson (1984:12) and James Brown (1997:476) have</page><page sequence="12">Giles] REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 51 3 Figure 6. Comparison of the Osage Tsi-Zhu tattoo to the design engraved on the femur from Hopewell Mound 25: (6.1) Ifci-Zhu tattoo on "Man of Mystery" clan male (image reproduced with the permission of James R. Duncan): (a) two- headed eagle at the top of this cosmogram; (b) three (stacked) cosmic levels; (c) world tree that serves as a support or axis mundi for the cosmos; (62) design engraved on a femur from Hopewell Mound 25 (Putnam and Willoughby 1893:303, Figure 2): (a) circular motif that may represent a celestial orb (sun/moon?); (b) central human visage in the design; (c) antler-like motifs on the top of the figure's head; (d) two-headed raptor overlaid on this figure's face. pointed out that the human body was conceived by some communities in the Eastern Woodlands as a microcosm that embodied the macrocosm. Hudson (1984: 12) argues that the Cherokee thought of the human body and community as "models by which the earth and cosmos were conceived." Thus, over- laying double-headed raptors on human faces dur- ing the Middle Woodland period was intended not only to portray particular ceremonial head- dresses, but also to articulate a visual pun that as- sociated the cosmological position of birds in the sky to the human face at the top of the body. Thus, it is possible that the depiction of avian character- istics on human faces articulated that at least par- ticular human bodies were relational models of the cosmos ànd vice versa. It is thus significant that the ancient cotton wood pole referred to as the "Venerable Man" in Osage ritual practice represents the resurrected Ho^-ga A-hui-toq (Duncan 2011:26). Conse- quently, the long linear body depicted for these double-headed raptors may reference the ceremo- nial pole/world tree, as hypothesized by Carr and Case (2005b: 193-197). These representations of double-headed raptors may be an important ele- ment of a mythic hero narrative in which Ho°-ga A-hui-to^ dies and is then reborn "as the axis of the universe along with the shining abode of the sun in the daytime sky (Duncan 2011:26; see also Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2004:207-21 1). Since the human body may have served as a model for the cosmos and vice versa (Brown 1997; Hudson 1984), donning these double-headed raptor head- dresses may have converted this ritual agent into a living axis mundi, where his head was the equiv- alent to the reborn/risen sun. Portraying double-headed raptors on human faces may exemplify analogous cosmograms be- cause Native American groups like the Osage be- lieved that all life descended from the sky to take on bodily form on the earth. This association is analogous to the complementary roles played by representatives of the earth and sky moieties in early Osage rituals (Bailey and La Flesche 1995).</page><page sequence="13">514 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 3, 2013 Emphasizing ritual complementarities may have been a way in which Hopewell people established peaceful relations with distant peoples, analogous to the Calumet and other adoption rites during the Contact and early Historic Periods (Hall 1997). There remains the question of why there should be analogous cosmological imagery for CORV among the "Plains" Dhegihan Sioux peo- ples (e.g., the Kaw, Osage, Omaha, Quapaw, and Ponca). However, many Dhegiha Siouan speakers have claimed that they are recent migrants to the Plains and other archaeologists have argued that the Osage originally lived in the American Bot- tom (Brown 2011; Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2004; Duncan 2011; Duncan and Diaz-Granados 2004). Some Dhegihan Siouan peoples contend that they came from even farther east. As James Marshall (2006:220) states, "The five related (Dhegihan Sioux) tribes, particularly the Omaha and Quapaw, have a tradition in which they speak of the Ohio River Valley in Kentucky and South- ern Indiana as their ancient homeland." John S wanton (1923, 1943) argued quite strongly based on early historic accounts that Siouan speakers lived in the CORV at contact (see also Griffin 1943:23-25). Swanton (1923, 1943) believed that it was the Siouan Mosopelea, based on Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin's 1683 map, who lived in the area around Chillicothe, Ohio, near Hopewell and Mound City. The Mosopelea may have been later referred to as the Ofo, who (re)appeared in the Lower Mississippi River Valley, where they lived in close association with the Biloxi and Tunica peoples (Swanton 1923, 1943). Robert Rankin (in Brain et al. 2004:596) has presented a phonological argu- ment for how "Mosopelea" could have been trans- formed to "Ofo," which supports Swanton's hy- pothesis. It is thus possible that Siouan cosmology and ceremonies may be a useful source of analo- gies for Ohio Hopewell ritual regimes. Even if a historical association between Siouan communities and Ohio Hopewell peoples exists, there likely were changes in beliefs about two- headed raptors through time. Moreover, it is diffi- cult to tie all these representation of double-headed birds to Siouan groups, since they were found over a broad geographic region. It therefore seems apparent that this iconographie theme was sym- bolically important for other groups as well. Thus, we should probably hedge our bets and compare these two-headed raptors to other Mississippian falconoid imagery, especially since Brown (2009) has argued that the Mississippian birdman also portrays Morning Star (see also Duncan 201 1 :22). Yet the identification of specific representations as depicting particular mythic characters and/or stars may not be the only way of pursuing this research. Subsequent analyses should historically contex- tualize this double-headed raptor imagery and ex- amine how it drew on earlier representations and contributed to later ones. Conclusion Shetrone's (1926:68-72) Burial 11 from under Hopewell Mound 25 has always been considered significant due to its elaborate headdress and ex- tensive grave goods. Yet its connection to a wide- spread iconographie theme was obscured by Willoughby's (1935) problematic interpretation of it (cf. Shetrone 1926; Webb and Snow 2001 [1945]:94). A careful review of the history of its interpretation, its archaeological context, and the reanalysis of the engraved femur that depicts many of the ceremonial regalia found in Hopewell Mound 25 reveals that it was a double-headed raptor headdress. It is noteworthy that Moore- head (1922), Shetrone (1926), and Mills (1922) found other representations of double-headed birds at Hopewell and Mound City (see also Giles 2009, 2010). Moreover, particular representations of double-headed raptors at these two Ohio Hopewell sites closely correspond to certain de- pictions on engraved stone tablets that have tra- ditionally been assigned to the Adena Culture. For example, the portrayal of double-headed raptors over the heads of two individuals on the Low Tablet is remarkably similar to the design en- graved on the femur from Hopewell. It therefore appears (contrary to previous thought) that the Hopewell site is at the heart of this double-headed raptor theme that parallels the imagery engraved on particular Woodland (Adena) tablets. The parallels between the iconography on the aforementioned tablets and certain symbols from Hopewell and Mound City suggest that similarity and difference in the CORV did not have a sim- ple linear relationship to distance. In contrast, the absence of double-headed raptorial depictions at</page><page sequence="14">Giles] REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 51 5 other large Ohio Hopewell sites, such as Turner, Liberty, and Seip, is itself noteworthy. It is there- fore possible that the Middle Woodland people who claimed Hopewell and Mound City devel- oped more extensive relationships with particular Middle Woodland groups from northern West Virginia and/or Kentucky than other Ohio Hopewell folk. There are probably other types of artifacts from Hopewell and Mound City that also signify these connections, such as the engraved serpentine tablets found in Hopewell Mound 1 (Squier and Davis 1998 [1848]) and the copper plates from Burial 2 under Mound 7 at Mound City (Mills 1922) that are conceptually similar to the engraved tablets. The bone awls found in the bottom left corner of Burial II's tomb may also be significant in this sense because analogous in- struments were often deposited with the engraved stone tablets. Similarly, Otto (1975) and Lepper (2005) have hypothesized that the stone tablets, bone awls, and pigments found together in the CORV were part of tattooing kits. So the presence of eight sharpened deer bone awls with Burial 1 1 may offer a window into a possible and intriguing connection between double-headed raptors and tattooing during the Middle Woodland period in the CORV. One way or another, these Middle Woodland representations of double-headed raptors had con- siderable continuity with earlier and later icono- graphie imagery. Yet there is very little ethnohis- toric information about the importance of two-headed raptors birds in the Eastern Wood- lands, even though these representations constitute a widespread and durable iconographie theme. However, Duncan (201 1) has recently documented the importance of a double-headed eagle in Dhegi- han Sioux cosmologies based on his interactions with members of the Osage Tribe and on Dorsey's (1885) ethnographic work. He states that this dou- ble-headed eagle was Ho^-ga A-hui-to*, who per- sonified the risen sun, while its two heads portray its dualistic masculine/ feminine nature and all- powerful- character as the first being (Duncan 201 1 :22). Moreover, the associations of Hog-ga A- hui-to* are complex, and he is tied to stories in which he and then his sons serially assume several roles linked to the sun and morning star (Brown 1997:93-95; Duncan 2011:26), which may have justified the inheritance of particular positions (Duncan 2011:20; Hall 1997). There are interesting correlations between these Osage beliefs and the prehistoric represen- tation of double-headed raptors in the Eastern Woodlands. For example, Ho^-ga A-hui-to^ is connected with the color red, and copper was of- ten used in the portrayal of this iconographie theme. Similarly, Dhegihan Sioux people ritually associated Ho^-ga A-hui-to^ with the cotton wood pole that served as an axis mundi, and many of these Middle Woodland double-headed birds were depicted with a long linear body that may illus- trate a similar axis mundi (e.g., World Tree) (see Carr and Case 2005b: 193-197). In addition, I have pointed out that representations of two- headed raptors may have been connected with tattooing and wearing ceremonial regalia in ways that played on the symbolism of the human body in the Eastern Woodlands. These double-headed raptors also seem to have been often incorpo- rated in the design of cosmograms. Nevertheless, a great deal of time has passed since the Hopewell fluorescence, so we need to be careful in our use of analogies and probably widen our comparative framework. We will also need to work at contextualizing these double- headed raptor representations as part of an itera- tive sequence of image making in which earlier depictions contributed to the form and content of later ones (Giles 2010). Nevertheless, the historic continuity of this iconographie theme is intrigu- ing, especially how it was probably reconceptu- alized at various times by different Native Amer- ican peoples.

Morgan and Com- pany, Louisville, Kentucky. Notes 1. Carr (2008:183) notes similarities between the organi- zation of a copper repoussé plate from Mound City (Figure 4.2 in this paper) and the Adena Tablets. 2. Greber and Ruhl (1989) note that two engraved femurs were found with different burials in Hopewell Mound 25 and it is possible that they were mixed up or incorrectly prove- nienced. This engraved femur has generally been attributed to Burial 278, but it could have been found with Burial 260/261 (Moorehead 1922). 3. Katherine Ruhl's (2005, Appendix 19.3) analysis of two of the copper earspools found next to the left hand of Shetrone's Burial 1 1 assigns them sedation values of 53 and 59. Since the averaged seriation values for earspools from Mound City is 16 (early), Hopewell is 165 (middle), and Seip is 153 (middle) (Ruhl and Seeman 1998), it seems very possible that Burial 1 1 under Hopewell Mound 25 was interred relatively early in the use of this ritual precinct. This temporal placement is generally compatible with the two radiocarbon dates (cal A.D. 120 ± 50 and A JD. 2 10 ± 140 with three intercepts at AD. 264, 28 1 , 329) from the Middle Woodland (Adena) Wright Mound in central Kentucky, which also produced a fragment of a tablet with an eneraved avian desien on it (Maslowski et al. 1995). 4. It is important to note that elements/motifs on this en- graved femur were probably intended to be visualized as part of multiple images (see Giles 2010). This visual punning may relate to an ontological emphasis on transformation in Ohio Hopewell representations (see Carr 2008; Carr and Case 2005b; Giles 2010). Along these lines, the central axial element- two large circular elements (eyes) and expanding fan-shaped motifs- was almost certainly intended to also portray the face of a (spoonbill?) duck, since this part of the design was depicted as two copper cutouts (see Willoughby in Greber and Ruhl 1989:251). 5. The engraved tablets from the CORV with raptor heads that have long curved beaks include the Berlin, Low, Wright, Wilmington, and Meigs Tablets (Penney 1980, 1982; Webb and Baby 1957). The raptor engraved on the cut human calvarium from the Florence Mound has a similar curved hook-like beak (Webb and Baby 1957:94). 6. However, it seems likely that groups at Hopewell and Mound City maintained extensive social relationships with the people who used other Ohio Hopewell sites, such as Seip, Edwin Harness, and Turner. For example, I have highlighted iconographie similarities between thé imagery at Mound City, Hopewell, Edwin Harness, and Turner in my dissertation (Giles 2010). I argue that the absence of double-headed bird imagery at these other Ohio Hopewell sites may indicate that people</page><page sequence="18">Giles] REASSESSMENT OF THE HEADDRESS ON BURIAL 11 FROM HOPEWELL MOUND 25 51 9 from Mound City and Hopewell established social ties with certain Middle Woodland peoples from northern West Vir- ginia and central Kentucky, while other Ohio Hopewell groups possibly did not. 7. These two snake effigy pipes have often been attributed to the cache of effigy platform pipes in Mound City, Mound 8, but the British Museum catalog and Edward Stevens's (1870) illustrated guide to the collections from the Blackmore Mu- seum attribute them to Mound 1 at the earthworks on the North Fork of Paint Creek (e.g., the Hopewell site). 8. This inference is supported by the lumps of hematite found in the grooves of a whetstone/tablet in the Natrium mound in West Virginia (Otto 1985:32). In addition, Dragoo (1961:99) found red ocher and what seemed to be ash caked within the grooves in most of the formal whetstone/tablets dis- covered in the Cresap Mound. How often bone awls were as- sociated with the Early/Middle Woodland stone and clay tablets encountered in the CORV is difficult to address because many of these tablets are surface finds, the result of less than pro- fessional excavations, or decontextualized mound fill (Otto 1985; Penney 1980, 1982). 9. The use of bone awls for tattooing is certainly not the only function that these tools could have served. For example, Carr and Case (2005b) have suggested that the bone awls found at Ohio Hopewell sites were used by "bone pickers" to deflesh the dead. It also seems possible that bone awls could have been used for fine engraving and punching holes in leather. Bone awls were employed to peg down covers over particular burials as well, especially in Illinois Hopewell bur- ial mounds (Brown 1979:217). However, the deposition of these bone awls in a line and particular corner of this tomb strongly suggests that the examples from Burial 1 1 in Hopewell Mound 25 did not fulfill this particular function. 10. A male bull elk's antlers can reach 1 .2 meters (4 feet) above its head, so that the animal can tower around 2.7 meters (9 ft) tall in total height. Moreover, Dragoo (1961) found a cer- emonial elk headdress in the Cresap Mound in northern West Virginia, while the elk plays an important role in the Omaha origin myth (Hall 1997:55).
