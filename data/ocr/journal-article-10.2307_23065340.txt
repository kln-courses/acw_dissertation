<plain_text><page sequence="1">3 "Turn on the Light!" Epiphany, the God-Like Hero Odysseus, and the Golden Lamp of Athena in Homer's Odyssey (Especially 19. 1-43) ANTON BIERL I. Introduction Thales and many Greeks with him believed that "all things were full of gods."1 The gods are omnipresent and ubiquitous; they tend to hide and in daily life they are not really visible. Yet, once upon a time, the gods shared their lives with humans in a more intimate way; in remote parts of the world, intimacy between humans and the gods may still be the case. In the here and now, on the other hand, gods rarely show themselves directly. It remains the case that the Greeks were particularly susceptible to experiencing epiphanies of the gods.2 Possibly, this is a heritage from the Minoan period that also shaped numerous features of Homeric epic, as many critics still believe.3 Be that as it may, in rare and highly dramatic moments particularly distinguished humans can fill gaps in epiphany. Therefore, Greeks sometimes need to enact signs of divine working in order to strengthen their belief that gods really exist. In Greek religion the way to make the gods appear is ritual invocation in the context of festivals. Through words, motion, and dance in particular, the Greeks try to trigger divine manifestations. In their dances, Greek 1 Ärist., De an. 41 la7. See Kirk, Raven, Schofield 1983: 95-98. 2 Even though the concept of epiphany is important, we should not overestimate its significance as modern critics, in the trend of religious phenomenology, tend to do. Above all we should be careful not to read into it Christian concepts of revelation, even if these build on Greek epiphany. It is certainly not a central feature of the history of religion as suggested by Pax 1962: 832. See also Pfister 1924: 281: "Der Glaube an diese Form der göttlichen Offenbarung gehört zu den Grundformen religiösen Denkens und Glaubens und ist alien Völkern gemeinsam."

The concept of mimesis is fundamental: certain gods such as Apollo or Artemis serve as models for the choregia\ by whirling and accompanying speech-acts of cletic hymns, the choreutai, and with them the participants of a festival, intend to invoke the god.4 Some divinities are more prone to appear eventually than others, such as Dionysus, Demeter, and Apollo. The need for the gods is particularly strong when there is an emergency and when humans seek divine help. Yet, divinities may also visit the earth under disguise in order to test mortals and, if necessary, to punish them. The divine parousia is a paradoxical fact. On the one hand, closeness to a god who shows himself alive and real means that the person who experiences divinity is selected; on the other hand, closeness may mean serious danger and even death. Very often reports of such an epiphany have a cultic or mythical basis. The relationship between myth and ritual is manifold: a cult may have been established after a legend of divine manifestation. Alternatively a traditional story and a rite can have arisen pari passu, or the cult can be aetiologically explained.5 II. Literature and Epiphanies In addition to these fundamentally religious epiphanies we have a rich repertoire of epic epiphany from the very beginning of our literate documentation. Homer initiates this tradition, which becomes a characteristic feature of the genre in the Greco-Roman world from Apollonius to Ennius, Virgil, Valerius, and Nonnus. Moreover, Homer also serves as the model for the literary epiphany in early lyric, Greek tragedy, and Hellenistic poetry. Epiphanies always tend to defy clarity, but Homer seems to be particularly vague and contradictory in the description of this phenomenon, as was recently stressed by B. C. Dietrich and Pietro Pucci.6 In what follows I will a give a brief phenomenological survey of Homeric epiphany as compared to other mythical and ritual based manifestations. I shall ask why Homeric epic and particularly the Odyssey is so very ambivalent and different in this respect. I believe that the answer lies in the structure of the carrier plot. In most mytho-cultic and literary forms the epiphany of a god is the central event; all actio remains secondary. It builds the frame of the entire action and culminates in the miraculous coming of a god. Very often the accompanying plot is the myth, the "traditional tale with secondary, 4 Bierl 2001: index, s.v. "Hymnos kletikos." 5 Versnel 1993: 15-88. 6 Dietrich 1983; Pucci 1987: 110-23. For a general survey on Homeric epiphany, see now Fernandez Contreras 1999.</page><page sequence="3">Anton Bierl 45 partial reference to something of collective importance"1 built around the rare manifestation of a divine being among mortals. Sometimes the god has his own interests in mind, such as his own mission. Literature incorporates such epiphanies in the plot. For example the Homeric Hymns often seem to be songs about the advent of a god. The second Hymn to Dionysus {Horn. Hymn Dio. 7) is based entirely on the arrival of the divinity (kommende Gott) and his manifestation to mortals. The same applies to the great Hymn to Demeter (Horn. Hymn Dem. 2). Let us now have a brief look at Euripides' Bacchae. It is possible to read this tragedy as the performance of an epiphany of Dionysus.8 In the cultic frame of the play, the god of the tragic genre arrives in the disguise of a Lydian priest at Thebes where his existence is negated. In the theater this epiphany is acted out in a series of Dionysiac appearances. First Dionysus appears in rather benevolent choral manifestations of his Lydian thiasos\ then more violently in the miracle of the palace; at the end there is the destructive Dionysiac sparagmos of Pentheus as theomachos. Dionysus simultaneously acts as a metatheatrical director, as an internal actor engaged in the play and as a spectator watching the brutal and cleverly conceived spectacle of the Dionysiac punishment of his enemy by the Asian maenads.9 The show of the festival and its processions, is linked to the show in the theater. The chorus of the spectacle acts in front of the polis, as the god wants to be "seen" and to be present.10 The same is valid in the complementary genre of Old Comedy. There, too, entire plays can be read as epiphanies in performance. It may be sufficient to recall the anodos of Eirene in Aristophanes' Peace and the reawakening or healing of Plutos in the late Plutos. In narrative genres of popular culture, we encounter epiphanies of gods who come to help people in situations of emergency, especially in war (see also Bravo in this volume). The side on which the god or hero has manifested himself will often be the victorious one.11 Because of such experiences local cults were established and a legend was told. III. Homeric Narratives, Epiphanies and Intervention Homeric epic often reflects such legends of gods helping in war. However, it is distinguished by a very different sort of narrative. Epic song has a long tradition of oral story telling behind it; its style is distinct. The stories are 7 Burkert 1979: 23. 8 Versnel 1990: 165-67. 9 Bierl 1991: 186-218. 10 Burkert 1987a, esp. 29-35; Bierl 2001: 306. 11 For example Hdt. 5. 80-81,6. 117, 8. 36-39; Pfister 1924:293-94.</page><page sequence="4">46 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) told in an elevated, artificial, and metrical language (epische Kunstsprache). Moreover, epic deals not with normal mortals but with heroes who excel in deeds of war and adventure and who stand in a special relation to certain gods. The oral manner of composition in performance brings forth a narrative full of formulae. Its main characteristic is a narrative technique by which signs or visual scenes (semata) have an "enhanced signification and rich coding." As such they are applied as "languages that offer enormous communicative potential for fluent speakers and hearers" by means of "traditional referentiality" in a traditional society based on ritual and myth.12 The permanent involvement and participation of the gods, the so-called epic Götterapparat, is part of this traditional way of expression. The story is set in a "prehistoric" world where normal mortals and heroes born from sexual encounters of mortals with gods easily interact with divine beings. In contrast to the simple legendary stories of divine help in war, in which the entire plot focuses on this central event occasionally leading to cultic worship, the Iliad and Odyssey present a complicated plot in twenty four books. Homeric epiphanies are not self-sufficient narratives but are subsumed in the plot. They are not linked to local cult, but function as pointers, directing the attention of the audience to a story with Panhellenic significance. The Trojan war is elevated to a national enterprise and the performance of its narrative is a highly esteemed cultural event for the entire community of Greek aristocrats. The Homeric gods stand above local and cultic commitments. The traditional divine apparatus has a sublime character appealing to all members of the Hellenic world. The gods dwell on Olympus, where burlesque scenes occur as proof of their distinctive otherness and complete independence. The Olympians interfere in the action and, by so doing, they direct the action; they lead out of a deadlock, help important heroes to continue to play the role of decisive agents, support the plot, and finally bring the solution. IV. Traditional Patterns, Epiphany, and the Odyssey The case of the Odyssey is different and represents another step ahead in many respects. The plot is more united and, from a narrative point of view, it is much more complicated than that of the Iliad. The gods seem to have stepped back, there are no more fights between them. All human life appears under the auspices of a theodicy guaranteed by Zeus. Instead of gods taking opposite sides, we have only Athena who actively aligns herself with her favorite Odysseus.13 She supports his return and revenge against 12 Foley 1999: 6 and passim, esp. 13-34. See also Foley 1990, 1995. 13 For Athena in Homer, see Erbse 1986: 116-55 and Wathelet 1995; for the Odyssey, see esp. Müller 1966.</page><page sequence="5">Anton Bierl 47 the suitors at Ithaca. Her help is not occasional; rather, she is the directing force of the entire action from the start until the very last verse of book twenty-four. By intervening with her father Zeus in book one, she sets in motion the narrative of return; as Hermes is sent to Ogygia to free Odysseus from Calypso, an initial move to break a long deadlock, Athena herself incites the young Telemachus to make a journey in search of his father. With this beginning, the narrative focuses on the desperate situation at home, the telos of the action, before we come back to Odysseus, after a new intervention in a second scene of council of gods in book five. Athena directs and controls the action by bringing together the two sides, home and abroad, she leads through the plot and helps the weak son as well as her mirroring image on earth, the witty protagonist Odysseus.14 Despite his exceptional metis Odysseus's mission seems to be impossible. From her traditional Olympian level Athena functions as the mastermind of the narrative. It is only with her support that the hero succeeds in the end and achieves his revenge and the reunion with Penelope. The traditional strife among the Olympians is reduced to a conflict between Athena and Poseidon but neither of them actively interferes in the sphere of the other. Uvo Hölscher and recent research on oral traditions have taught us that the Odyssey is built on a traditional pattern of an oral return epic, on a fairy tale-like "simple story" (einfache Geschichte). It is the traditional tale of the war hero being away from home for a very long time and returning back there in the very last moment, just before his wife, who is courted by numerous men, marries again. In our Odyssey this endlessly repeated and varied tale has grown into a huge epic poem which competes with the Iliad. Having shed all local atmosphere it assumes a Panhellenic and heroic character and weaves into its texture all sorts of heroic narratives from the great Trojan national cycle.15 Athena not only helps the main hero, she is also responsible for the tendency of postponement and retardation, which make the epic poem grow complex and long.16 Her interventions are never full-fledged epiphanies. Of course, as the term is imprecise, we may term many of these instances "partial epiphanies." Only once, in book thirteen, she seems to appear in her real shape and full light (enarges) in front of Odysseus, and this marks the decisive new beginning immediately after the middle of the poem, when Odysseus has landed at Ithaca with her support.17 But even in this famous 14Murnaghan 1995. 15 Hölscher 1989: passim; for the Panhellenisation, see ibid., 163-69; for the simple story of a return song, see ibid., 25-34, 39, 162-67; Grossardt 1998, esp. 12-31; Foley 1999, 115-67; on traditional referentiality, see above n. 12. 16 Hölscher 1989:92,240. "See Clay 1983:186-212.</page><page sequence="6">48 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) encounter all is fluid as far as the epiphany is concerned. It is not clear at all how we are meant to imagine the exact proceedings. After she has changed her appearance from the shape of a young man to a beautiful woman, can we be sure that she is identical with her real appearance? Gods are difficult to see for mortals {Horn. Hymn Dem. 2. Ill),18 and it is practically impossible to recognize them in their true identity. The more they are removed from men, the more the very image of the gods can only be imagined. It is a permanent and vague contradiction and paradox: as the Greeks think of their gods in anthropomorphic terms, the gods can only show themselves in the shape of men; but when they appear in the guise of men, they are no longer real gods. If they assume human morphe, they have to assume the appearance of an individual, such as Mentes, Mentor, etc., in order not to be completely without any identity. Anthropomorphism seems to contradict "deity," but it makes gods menschlich, allzu menschlich as well, recognizable without any categorical gap. This paradox between einai and dokein seems to be reflected in the semantic concretization of the verb phainesthai, whose meaning ranges from "showing oneself' to "seeming as if." The Odyssey is an extremely self-conscious poem. Its author, as many critics have recently underlined, reflects on its own flctionality and textuality.19 Therefore, almost everything is subordinate to the artful plot. Homer is not really interested in epiphanies as such. There is no genuine concern for how these should work. And, of course, as a superhuman experience they are not self-sufficient events of a local cult, but integrated into the tale in order to make it move on. On the one hand, Athena is an internal actor belonging to the traditional apparatus and resembling to a great extent her human equivalent in matters of intelligence. On the other hand, as Ergane, mistress of the artful handicraft, she is an external force who directs, and is responsible for, the highly artificial textuality. Just as the internal agent Penelope weaves and undoes her peplos (2. 93-110; 19. 138— 56; 24. 128-46), thus reflecting the multiform textuality of the epic poem, in the same way Athena functions as a controlling mastermind of textuality in her role as divine weaver.20 In this way Athena resembles the author, an orally composing aoidos who is in charge of the Panhellenic product of an artful and cultured song. Whereas the other gods have generally retreated from the action, she works in and out of the plot.21 Her new meta-poetic role, which is based on the ever valid traditional idea of an Olympian 18 Horn.,//. 20.131; Od. 13.312-13, 16. 161. 19Pucci 1987; Segal 1994: 85-183. 20 See Papadopoulou-Belmehdi 1994 with the critical note of Pucci 2000. 21 Olson 1995:140-60, esp. 142, and 221; Murnaghan 1995.</page><page sequence="7">Anton Bierl 49 supervision and participation, reflects the Olympian perspective of the author who, in his own way, is also permanently present in the story, as the aoidos/rhapsodos who narrates the facts from his personal point of view, as a performing singer of tales who has the poetic material under his control.22 Similar to the Bacchae where Dionysus controls the action, Athena directs it in the Odyssey and gives insights and a surplus of information to the audience in such a way that the listener becomes an accomplice of the god/author and knows more than the internal actors. As Penelope and Odysseus are also distinguished by extreme intelligence, there arises a curious area of indeterminacy where we are left uncertain if these internal agents know more than they seem to. The outcome is determined already by the traditional narrative pattern; we focus only on the how. By presenting Athena as a director who is permanently ready to step into the action through an epiphany, Homer succeeds in creating a certain kind of suspense with regard to the divine. He gives a mysterious touch to his artful plot, which is full of delay and retardation. There is somebody behind the curtain, a divine figure partially showing herself. Even if Odysseus's whole mission seems impossible, we are given the mysterious assurance that the plot will not fail and that we will reach the end of the traditional pattern. Despite the more or less negative result concerning Athena's epiphanies I will now show that the Odyssey, nevertheless, builds to a considerable extent upon the traditional pattern of epiphany. My suggestion is that the entire narrative is, in a way, the literary reflection of the epiphany, not of a god, but of the main agent Odysseus.23 In this respect it also resembles the Iliad, where Achilles has a delayed epiphany after his initial retreat from the battle-line.24 Together with the extreme Panhellenism and anthropocentrism in the epics, we observe a trend to divinize the hero. Whereas gods are described as anthropomorphic, the main figure comes very close to the Olympians. Of course, heroes cannot really reach divine status and immortality, but through the traditional song they gain the kleos aphthiton, a glory that does not die.25 Odysseus accomplishes an incredible deed, but he needs the help of the god, and above all the advice to enter the palace in disguise. This particular element of miming a beggar belongs to 22 See Nagy 1996a: 62-71. 23 For the comparison of book 19 with an epiphany, see Austin 1975: 224-25, 227, 230, 236,238. 24 See Lord 1960: 186-97, esp. 186 for Achilles and Odysseus as gods in a divine stoiy pattern of absence and return. For the Odyssey, see ibid., 175: "These incidents are multiforms of a single theme four times repeated, whose meaning, deeply bedded in the myth underlying the story, is that the resurrected god in disguise is rejected by the unworthy, who cannot recognize him."

In his true identity Odysseus is a splendid and god-like figure whom everybody would immediately recognize. Consequently he would not have any chance in fighting alone against the overwhelming majority of suitors, but he would be killed at the very first moment of his arrival. It is one of the leitmotifs to mistake him for a god or ironically confound him with a divine figure. This seems to be part of the traditional repertoire, but in the Odyssey it has its own truth because in his hidden identity Odysseus will have his epiphany, his revelation as true master of the household who re-establishes order in a topsy-turvy world. In fact in book twenty-two, he will be associated with Apollo taking terrible revenge with the bow on the occasion of his new-year festival.26 Moreover the final recognition scene in book twenty-three is skillfully delayed until the very end where Odysseus as the "angry" man will be revealed as such by his wife who shares with him homophrosyne through metis and intelligence.27 Hiding, disguise, acting from an ambush (lochos) with a final revelation or detection of his true identity, all this belongs to Odysseus. He is often the anti-hero who does not confront the enemy openly and in full visibility but with a mask, or from a hiding-place. Together with the successful revenge comes the act of revealing himself. The author of the Odyssey uses the concealment in order to stress the difference between mortal limitation, "seeming," and the divine omniscient perspective, "being;"28 Athena bridges the gap and leads her favorite to his epiphany. The mask of the beggar gives this epic with its self-conscious perspective almost a comic quality leaving open the notion of a distant area of truth and divine justice. It is transparent for us, but also, more or less, for his enemies who are blind to see. Furthermore, the author does not invent a miraculous disguise, but in the typically naturalistic tendency of the Odyssey, puts the arriving hero under a mask of an old stranger and ragged beggar which in many ways is his very identity; after twenty years he is much older than before, he is a stranger after such a long time of absence. The adventures and storms would have deprived him of all his goods and status, if the Phaeacians had not given him all the treasures in the last episode before his landing at Ithaca. Some critics have recently applied the pattern of theoxenia to the plot. They are right to see that Odysseus's return to a great extent resembles the traditional story of a god who arrives in disguise in order to test people if 26 Horn., Od. 21. 258-59, 22. 276-78.

As a god who comes as a divine guest, Odysseus has a strong affinity to Dionysus, particularly as we have seen him in the Bacchae,30 Another traditional sign attached to epiphany and Odysseus is light and glamour.31 People who see such splendid radiation react with astonishment and fear, because they have the presentiment of divine presence. But Odysseus is far from being a fallen sun-, summer- or light-god, as many believed in the nineteenth century.32 Just as epiphany and god-like status serve as metaphorical predication, in the same way the movement out of the darkness into beaming light is only a metaphor for the narrative revelation of a great hero in a marvelous song which grants never-fading glory to both the singer and the hero.33 In the famous scene of the removal of the weapons at the beginning of book nineteen, there is one of the few instances in the Odyssey of a more developed epiphany working with the effect of light. I leave aside all the problems and discrepancies with the preparations in book sixteen.34 After the great appearance of Penelope in front of the suitors—and Odysseus in book eighteen—the god-like hero remains in the hall and together with Athena plans the death of the suitors (19. 1-2). Then he addresses his son and tells him to remove all the weapons. Telemachus obeys and orders Eurycleia to keep the maids away until the operation is over. With a practical mind, Eurycleia asks who will provide for the necessary light, if the girls who would normally do the job, are not allowed to accompany him (19. 24-25). Telemachus replies that the stranger will do it; since he gets food, he will have to do him this favour (19. 26-28). Then Eurycleia shuts the door and father and son remove helmets, shields and spears; "and ahead went Pallas Athena/ with her golden lamp (chryseon lychnori) and provided very beautiful light" (phaosperikalles; 19. 29 Kearns 1982; Murnaghan 1987, esp. 11-19, 56-117; Reece 1993: 181-87. 30Burnett 1970.

Full of astonishment Telemachus says to his father:35 Father, a great miracle (neYa QccOjaa) here I see with my eyes. Every detail of the walls. . . appears before his eyes, as if fire was shining. Truly a god is inside here of those who live in broad heaven! (ri pctAa xiq deÖQ 'evõov, oi oupavõv eupuv exouai). Odysseus then answers that he must be quiet and not ask any further questions; that will be the way of the gods (19. 41-43). This passage has provoked considerable discussion. Already in antiquity critics stated that lychnos, a hapax legomenon in Homer, is a more recent invention; normally in the Homeric epic torches give light, whereas lamps were in use only as of c. 650 B.C.E.36 Therefore there are some scholars who draw the conclusion that this passage is a late Athenian interpolation.37 And Pausanias reports that the famous oil-lamp in the Erechtheum on the Acropolis was only produced around the end of the fifth century B.C.E. by the great artist Callimachus.38 But it certainly had predecessors. In any case, the golden lychnos as well as the kiste belong to the old and fundamental cultic implements of Athena Polias on the Acropolis.39 Myths transmitted, unfortunately, only by later authors refer to them. The child Erichthonius/Erechtheus in the kiste was obviously guarded by the lamp,40 and the Cecropidae apparently handled both of them. In the famous fragment of Euphorion, something must have happened to the lamp: maybe it fell down and its fire was extinguished.41 All things considered, we cannot be sure how far the introduction of a lychnos reaches back, but archaeological evidence should make us cautious about the argument that the lamp existed already in Mycenaean times. Be that as it may, Rudolf Pfeiffer pleads for a Mycenaean origin of the eternal lamp.42 The tradition of elements from the Mycenaean-Minoan epoch in the Homeric epics is a vexed problem; it will suffice to recall the recent debate about Joachim Latacz's theses.43 Of course, it is precisely in 35 Horn., Od. 19.36-40. 36 For the sources, see Pfeiffer 1960: 2-3.

But in my opinion it is much more probable that during the times of Pisistratus and his son Hipparchus, when the recitation of the Homeric epics was institutionalized in the agon of the Panathenaea,44 Athens tried to give the Panhellenic song a specifically Athenian touch, particularly in cultic matters relating to the polis-goddess Athena.45 However, this did not happen through the intervention of a later Bearbeiter, as the analytical school believed. The text has to be preserved, and verses are not corrupt, and make good sense, such as the famous lines where Athena after her intervention for Odysseus in the land of the Phaeacians "returned to Marathon, to the broad streets of Athens and entered into the splendid home of Erechtheus" (Od. 7. 80-81). I prefer a fluid, orally produced text of "Homer" reaching down at least until 660 B.C.E., with later intrusions and adaptations based on cultural circumstances of the new center of Athens, where the gradual fixation of the text took place.46 In such an open model of textualization (creation of a text), an Ionian rhapsodos may have adapted some minor details for the sake of the Athenian audience. And of course, the Athenians certainly recognized or read into this great narrative, directed by their polis-goddess, parts of their reality, especially of their cultic and ritual life. In a context dominated by Athena, all the Athenian rites on the Acropolis could be alluded to: the Arrhephoria, the entire complex of initiation and new-year festivals, the Panathenaea together with the Plynteria and the Kallynteria.47 It is hard to decide whether these ritual allusions were originally intended for a predominantly Ionian context or rather re-projected upon the traditional narrative. I doubt that the plot is tied in to a particular occasion, as Christoph Auffarth suggests for this passage. He argues that the lychnos is not only an allusion to Athenian cult reality, but that it is applied in the right moment of the plot: the lamp would shine at the very moment during the Panathenaea 44 PI,,Hipparch. 228b-c. 45 Cook 1995. 46 Burkert 1976 pleads for the written fixation around 660 B.C.E. In his opinion, the final redaction happened in 570-560 B.C.E. at the latest; see Burkert 1987b; 2001: 127-37. In his evolutionary model, Nagy 1996a and 1996b argues for a much more protracted multiform fluidity of the Homeric text down to the middle of the second century B.C.E. He attributes a number of potential intrusions to a "definitive period, centralized in Athens, with potential texts in the sense of transcripts" (1996b: 42) from the middle of the sixth to later fourth century B.C.E. For a recent precision of the "Panathenaic bottleneck," see Nagy 2001, against Finkelberg 2000, with reference to prominent critics who have recently suggested a uniform standardized text either earlier than the Panathenaea or as a result of the Pisistratean recension. 47 Cook 1995: 128-70; Papadopoulou-Belmehdi 1994.

The constitutive Panhellenism49 avoids any total coincidence of plot and occasional framing, but the plot, without doubt, reflects and is built upon patterns of ritual processes of temporary reversal into an upside-down world and the return to the established order. Such occasions might be initiation and new-year festivals. The epic song may well have hinted at some cultic reality. However, Homer decontextualizes myth and ritual. The motifs are integrated into the poem just for metaphorical reasons. In our example even the golden lamp which is so specifically linked to the Athenian cult reality serves only as illumination. Light is needed and it is provided by the goddess in a very partial epiphany which is not an event told for its own sake.50 Rather it is completely embedded in the plot. Even when Telemachus senses the epiphany of a god, it is Odysseus who wards off this notion and minimizes the religious experience; the son should keep it for himself and should not go on asking, it is simply the way of gods (Od. 19. 42-43). The mysterious sensation is kept, but the episode is not explained in religious terms. Homer is not interested in giving a long story of ritual anchored in Athenian life nor in dwelling on the miracle. The lamp was introduced for the sake of its light, it was needed. As nobody else was there, it was Athena who had to provide for it. She manages everything. Similar to the author she directs the narrative,51 but with the religious touch the instance of the author becomes a mysterious, almost superhuman force. That is the way of the gods and also of the author responsible for the advancement of the plot. As the goddess has her human-heroic counterpart in the narrative, to some degree she also merges with Odysseus.52 In the context of this passage, we are already familiar with a shining and brilliant Odysseus. When asked who is going to provide the light, Telemachus answers, "This stranger" (Od. 19. 27), i.e. Odysseus himself. It becomes very vague and unclear how Athena really brought light. Nobody saw her, and it is only the voice of the singer as author who tells that Athena has come with her golden lamp. Did she really go ahead carrying 48 Auffarth 1991: 290-91, 407-09, 582.1 follow the refutation of Cook 1995: 166 n. 125; there are no proofs for a connection with the Panathenaea, but sources link the camp with the Arrhephoria and Scira. See also Burkert 1983: 151-52. 49 Nagy 1999: 7-9, 115-21, 139-42; Hölscher 1989: 163-69, 184; Nagy 1990: index, s.v. "Panhellenism." 50 Dietrich 1983: 68.

At this particular moment the singer as author needs light, and as nobody else is there, he ascribes the illuminating effect to Athena. From the limited point of view of Telemachus it almost looks as if the walls were shining by themselves (Od. 19. 37-39), "as if a fire was burning" (cog el irupo? al0on€voio; Od. 19. 39). Did the light come from Athena's counterpart, that is from Odysseus himself (Od. 19. 27)?54 In many other instances nearby he is associated with light and with the verb "to burn" (a'lGw/aiGeoGai). He loves to cover himself but also to reveal himself. In the epic song of "traditional referentiality,"55 the narrative proceeds in an associative and pictorial way. Only a few scenes before, Odysseus uttered the wish to take over from the maids the task of providing light for the suitors in the hall (Od. 18. 313-19): a {reap eyu toutoioi (jxxot; iravxeooi irape^w (Od. 18. 317). The suitors and maids react with laughter and mockery. Angrily he stays to nourish the flame: aurap õ trap Aaiiircipoi ((xxetvcov al0o|ievoiot.v/ earrjKeiv ... (Od. 18. 343 44). And Eurymachus further adds the ridicule which refers to the truth and at the same time comically reflects epiphanic imagery: "Truly, not without a god comes this man into the house of Odysseus!" He even continues by saying that the shining does not only seem to come from the torches but also from his bald head:56 ouk dOeel 06' ävf|p 'Oõuoiftov tQ õö^ov iKer €|iitr|C |j.oi õok«i õatõuv aeXuc, €|i|j.evai aütoö KctK K€((jaA.fi&lt;;, eirei oü oi «vi Tpi%€g ouõ' riPaiaC. In the next scene, when Odysseus has his first personal encounter with Penelope, he invents a fictional identity as Aithon, "the burning one" (Od. 53 This scandalized some of the ancient commentators, who took it literally. They thought Homer violated good taste by reducing a goddess to the status of a maid. See Schol.

See Schwartz 1924: 59; Merkelbach 1951: 94. For a different opinion, see Woodhouse 1930: 176 who believes that in the original "saga of Odysseus" (169-98), Penelope, Eumaeus, and Philoetius played an active role in the revenge, whereas Telemachus was added later. In the revised version, i.e. our Odyssey, Penelope, who assisted at the removal of the arms by carrying the lamp, was replaced by Athena herself. 55 A term coined by Foley, see also above n. 12. 56 Horn., Od. 18. 353-55: "This man does not come to the house of Odysseus without the will of some god: to me, however, the flame of the torches seems to be from him, and his head; since he has no hair, not even a little" (Buckley's 1851 translation, slightly adapted).

For the metaphorical association of light with victory in combat, see Russo 1992: 68 (on Horn., Od. 18. 317-19), 76 (on Horn., Od. 19. 36 40). See also the good remarks by Austin 1975: 282-83 n. 16.
