<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Secret Religion of Germany: Christian Piety and the Pantheism Controversy* B. A. Gerrish / University of Chicago It is the religion of our greatest thinkers, our best artists.... Nobody says it, but everyone knows it: pantheism is an open secret in Germany. We have in fact outgrown deism. We are free and want no thundering tyrant. We are grown up and need no fatherly care. And we are not the botchwork of a great mechanic. Deism is a religion for slaves, for children, for Genevans, for watchmakers. Pantheism is the secret religion of Germany. [HEINRICH HEINE]1 A "liberated Prussian" living in Paris, Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) wanted to persuade his French hosts that Germany, too, had under- gone a revolution. Unlike the social and political upheaval in France, Germany's revolution, at least initially, was of the mind. But Heine found some remarkable parallels between them. By asserting that for eight years Kant's first critique (1781) attracted little attention, he even managed to place the beginnings of both revolutions in exactly the same year (1789). More important, he discovered in the Critique of Pure Reason an act of deicide, the counterpart to the act of regicide that sealed the end of the ancien regime in France.2 * This was an inaugural lecture given at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago on May 20, 1986.

There are some oddities about his use of both terms, "deism" and "pantheism," and to this we shall need to return. In general, however, he was surely right: the passage of thought in Germany from the Enlightenment to Romanticism and Idealism was an intellectual revolution, and it did bring about a shift in the way the intelligentsia thought of God, a shift from deism toward pantheism. The German revolution cannot be simply identified with Kant's first critique. Heine did not imagine that it could; Kant, for him, repre- sented the negative, deicidal phase of the revolution. But the story also goes back to a summer's day in 1780, when a casual meeting between G. E. Lessing and F. H. Jacobi set in motion events leading to the famous Pantheism Controversy. To trace this other, more positive thread in the story is to witness one of the pivotal moments in Western religious thought, a moment that brought it closer to some of the forms of Far Eastern religious thought. Merely to relate what happened cannot tell us who was right, or what view of the deity we ourselves should entertain. The church dog- maticians among us will agree with Karl Barth that the true theologian should not dally overmuch with history but head straight forJerusalem. When two of his associates published dogmatic works heavily laden with historical digressions, Barth wrote that he hid his face in shame that his friends, good people though they were, had not learned from him even this much: you cannot do theology by engaging every posi- tion, old and new, in dialogue.3 He was right. To the theologian, the destination-the object, the truth itself-is everything. But it does not follow that the road to Jerusalem is straight or short. If the language in which truth becomes flesh is given to us by history, then the dialogue with others is something we have to travel through, not, as in Barth's image, something to keep behind us. Historical understanding of reli- gious beliefs will always strike the foursquare theologian as a contempt- ible torso if unaccompanied by the kind of "theses"-the forthright assertions of truth-for which Barth said he was hungry. But the most cogent dogmatic arguments for or against a theological thesis can never quite transcend the relativities of its historical genesis and growth. And the Pantheism Controversy reminds us that religious belief, or religious 3 Karl Barth to Helmut Gollwitzer, July 31, 1962, in Barth, Briefe, 1961-68, in Karl Barth: Gesamtausgabe, division 5, vol. 4, ed. Jiirgen Fangmeier and Hinrich Stoevesandt (Zurich: Theo- logischer Verlag, 1975), pp. 82-83 (no. 49), and Barth to Walter Kreck, July 31, 1962, pp. 86-87 (no. 50). The two "friends" were Kreck and Otto Weber. That Barth thought it at least possible to converse with "the fathers and brethren" along the way, and yet to keep one's mind on the heavenly destination, is clearly attested by those remarkable excursions into historical theology that adorn every chapter of his own Church Dogmatics. 438</page><page sequence="3">The Secret Religion of Germany unbelief, is sometimes more forceful when clothed not in a thesis, but in a poem. The controversy turned around the personal relationships among three remarkable men. It began as a difference of opinion between Jacobi and Moses Mendelssohn about Lessing's beliefs in the closing decade of his life, the time of the "Wolfenbiittel Fragments" and Nathan the Wise. Initially, one is inclined to suppose that Mendelssohn, if anyone, must have known what Lessing believed. But Jacobi claimed to be privy to a dark secret about him. The disagreement centered on Lessing's relation to Spinoza, and when the two contenders took their argument before the public in print, it grew into a broad literary debate about the merits of Spinoza's allegedly "pantheistic" conception of God. Throughout his career, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-81) had taken a public stand for the cause of religious enlightenment. After his appointment as librarian to the duke of Brunswick in Wolfenbiittel (1770), he was drawn into theological controversy over the notorious Wolfenbiittel Fragments (1774-78), which may be said to have launched the quest for the historical Jesus. A letter from Duke Charles, dated August 17, 1778, forbade him to publish anything further on reli- gious matters without express authorization. But Lessing was inca- pable of maintaining silence; in his play Nathan the Wise (1779), he returned to what he called his "old pulpit, the theater." Taking his inspiration from Boccaccio's Decameron, he borrowed the tale of the three rings. In Boccaccio's version, Saladin the Saracen asks the Jew Melchisedek a trick question: which of the three religions-Judaism, Christianity, or Islam-is the true one? The adroit Jew responds with a story. A certain man had three sons, only one of whom could receive the priceless family ring. Loving all three, the father had two perfect replicas made, and on his deathbed he gave one ring to each son. He himself could hardly tell which was the original heirloom, and he carried the secret with him to the grave; to this day, no one knows for sure which of the three sons was the man's true heir. The moral is clear. Lessing's version introduces an intriguing change. In Nathan the Wise, we are told that the original ring makes him who wears it in faith beloved of God and man, but when it is brought to the father along with the two copies, even he cannot tell it from the others. Since none of the three sons is much loved by the other two, but each loves himself best, is it possible that the real ring has been lost and that three copies are all that is left? Well, maybe. But the point of the story, as Lessing tells it, is that while each son may believe he has the true ring, all 439</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion should emulate the father's love, who loved all three alike and would not humiliate two of them to favor one.4 Although it has sometimes been denied, the prevailing view has always been-from Lessing's own day until ours-that Nathan the Wise was modeled on the character of the Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786), a prominent leader of the Berlin Enlighten- ment. Born the same year, Lessing and Mendelssohn had been friends since 1754, when a common love for chess first brought them together. Mendelssohn stood aloof from the theological wrangling into which Lessing was seduced by his publication of the Wolfenbiittel Fragments. But despite their differences, the two friends occupied common terri- tory in their estimate of religion. While not gainsaying the usefulness of a particular historical religion to those to whom it is revealed, they located the core of every faith in the moral content it shared with the others. Friedrich HeinrichJacobi (1743-1819), our third protagonist, was a very different man, mistrustful of human reason and burdened with missionary zeal. His relationship with Lessing was not of such long standing as Mendelssohn's; it dates from the publication of Jacobi's novel Woldemar (1779), which must be understood as part of the incipi- ent revolt against the Enlightenment. Goethe was contemptuous of the work. It was all the more important to the author's self-esteem, there- fore, when Lessing, though a spokesman for the enlightened, gave him friendly encouragement and sent him a copy of Nathan the Wise in exchange. The following summer, less than a year before Lessing's death, Jacobi paid him a visit in Wolfenbiittel.5 On the second day of the visit (July 6, 1780), Jacobi produced an unpublished poem of Goethe's entitled "Prometheus," expecting that Lessing, who had so often given offense, might now take offense at what another had written. The poem reads like this: Cover your heavens, Jove, with misty clouds and practice, like a boy beheading thistles, on oaks and mountain peaks! My earth you must leave me still standing, and my cottage, which you did not build, 4 G. E. Lessing, Nathan der Weise, act 3, scene 7. 5 Our sole source of information for the visit is Jacobi's own account of it in a letter to Mendelssohn (November 4, 1783) reproduced in Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Uber die Lehre des Spinoza, in Briefen an Herrn Moses Mendelssohn (1st ed., 1785), in Friedrich HeinrichJacobi 's Werke, vol. 4, pt.-vol. 1 (Leipzig: Gerhard Fleischer, 1819), pp. 47-94. 440</page><page sequence="5">The Secret Religion of Germany and my hearth whose warmth you envy me.

This sounded to Jacobi like Spinoza. Lessing agreed: "If I am to call myself after anyone, I know of no one else."Jacobi concluded that Lessing, without the knowledge of the public, or even of his friends, was no longer the great champion of the Enlightenment but in his riper years had moved on, or fallen back, to a quite different standpoint. Jacobi had no sympathy at all for Spinozism; the next morning, he testified to Lessing that he himself believed in an intelligent, personal cause of the world. "Oh," said Lessing, "so much the better! There, for sure, I'm going to hear something completely new." Undaunted by this evident sarcasm, the visitor explained that Spinozism leads to deter- minism, and any system that logically entails the denial of free will has to be mistaken, however flawlessly reasoned. "I love Spinoza," Jacobi said, "because he...has led me to perfect assurance that some things cannot be explained." Lessing commented: "I note that you would like to have your will free. I do not crave free will.... I remain an honest Lutheran."7 Soon after Lessing's death on February 15, 1781, Mendelssohn determined to write an appreciation of his character, of which, he believed, Lessing's writings could give a false impression. The close- ness of the personal relationship between them was common knowl- edge, and if anyone could claim to be a Lessing expert, it would surely have had to be Mendelssohn. Two years later, the promised character study had still not appeared. But Elise Reimarus was able to assure Jacobi (in March 1783) that Mendelssohn's intention remained firm, and in so doing she unwittingly opened the door to the Pantheism Con- troversy. In his reply, Jacobi confided to her the secret that in his last days Lessing had become a Spinozist, and he added (twice, in case she did not rise to take the bait the first time) that she should feel free, at her discretion, to pass the secret on to Mendelssohn, who may not have been privy to it. "Perhaps,"Jacobi intimated, "Lessing spoke his mind as openly to his dear Mendelssohn as he did to me, but perhaps not, 6 Translation is from Walter Kaufmann, trans. and ed., Twenty German Poets: A Bilingual Collection, Modern Library (New York: Random House, 1962), pp. 9-11. 7 Jacobi's Werke, vol. 4, pt.-vol. 1:51-55, 59-61, 70-71. 442</page><page sequence="7">The Secret Religion of Germany since he had not talked with him for a long time and disliked writing letters."8 Elise Reimarus did exercise her discretion (as planned), and Jacobi furnished his evidence. The Pantheism Controversy was on. The original point at issue was whether Lessing's mind, toward the end of his life, had been tainted with Spinozism, but the nature and merits of Spinozism itself quickly became the center of attention. Once the controversy became public (in 1785), it took a surprising turn that neither Jacobi nor Mendelssohn could have wished for. Albeit by dif- ferent routes, the two contestants both arrived, after all, at the concep- tion of God as an agent who acts on the world from outside; neither of them had any inclination to embrace Spinoza's alleged pantheism. But many German intellectuals now took another look at the "dead dog" Spinoza (as Lessing called him), and they discovered they liked him better than they liked either Jacobi or Mendelssohn. A "Neo- Spinozism" broke out that was to become one of the main sources of a new philosophy, and so the source of another beginning for Christian theology, which had suffered in the Age of Reason at the hands of friends and foes alike. Even Goethe, though he had no interest in a revival of Christian theology, fell into the habit of carrying Spinoza's Ethics in his pocket and wrote to Jacobi the famous words: "[Spinoza] does not prove the existence of God; existence is God. And if for this reason others chide him as an atheist, I should like to name him and praise him as theissimum and indeed christianissimum [a theist and a Christian in the highest degree]."9 II What, then, is "Spinozism"? And why did so many of Germany's lead- ing intellectuals find it attractive? No single answer will do for them all. Goethe no doubt touches on the essential point in his letter to Jacobi: for Spinoza, God is not a being but being itself; nature and God consti- tute an indivisible unity, deus sive natura. But in Heine andJ. G. Herder, to take just two examples, the possibilities of Spinozism follow two very different courses. The one, though Jewish by birth and Christian by a baptism of convenience, was at heart a cheerful pagan, whereas the other (to borrow Lessing's phrase) was an honest Lutheran; and they lived through different phases of the German revolution, Heine in fact appearing on the scene much later than Herder. Small wonder if they arrived at unlike estimates of Spinoza's alleged atheism. Heine was 8 Jacobi to "Emilie" (Elise Reimarus), July 21, 1783, ibid., pp. 39-40. 9 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe to Jacobi, June 9, 1785, in Goethes samtliche Werke (Propylaen- Ausgabe) (Munich: Georg Miiller, 1910), 4:392. 443</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion happy to embrace the fundamental Spinozist principle as "pantheism." Herder was unwilling to accept either name, "Spinozist" or "pantheist," and yet he too believed that Spinoza had opened up the philosophy of the future. Like everyone else, Heine took "pantheism" and "deism" to be mutually defining terms: the God of the pantheists is in the world, whereas the God of the deists is out of, or over, the world, which he rules from above as though it were a separate establishment. But Heine made no distinction, such as we commonly make, between the absentee God of deism and the ever-present God of theism, between the divine watchmaker who has finished his work and the busy, active Lord whose work never ends. Judaism and Christianity he treats as varieties of deism, alongside the "school of Geneva," by which he means Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his friends. Rousseau was not quite the typical deist, but the fact that his father, Isaac Rousseau, was a watch- maker was too happy a coincidence for Heine to resist. The deists, Heine says, differ among themselves only with respect to the manner of God's rule: the Hebrews think of him as a thundering tyrant; the Chris- tians, as a loving father; and the Genevan school, as a clever artist who made the world just as papa made watches. The fundamental point, for Heine, is that in all three varieties of "deism" God is pictured as acting on the world from the outside.10 But why did this strike him as such an inappropriate idea? The notion of a Spirit God who is out of, or above, the material world went together, in Heine's mind, with a religiousness that degrades the body. Here, too, Judaism and Christianity belong together, with only a difference of degree between them: Judaism merely belittles the body as the envelope of the spirit, whereas Chris- tianity spurns the body as something bad. Partly under the influence of Manichaeism and Gnosticism, and more remotely of the religions of Persia and India, Catholic Christianity, according to Heine, set body and spirit in enmity to each other. The purest blossom of the Christian idea, which is that all sensuous delight ought to be suppressed, was the monastic life. Everything sweet and lovely was decried by medieval folk as devilish seduction, and the devout crossed themselves anxiously at the song of the nightingale. But the church, having little success in denying the body, settled for a compromise: an ingenious system of satisfactions and indulgences contrived not to abolish sensuality but to tax it instead. Luther, unfortunately, never appreciated the genius of 10 Heine, Deutschland (n. 1 above), pp. 57-58. Heine discovered a special affinity between deism and Judaism, his own ancestral faith: the Jews are the Swiss guard of deism (p. 55), and Moses Mendelssohn cleaved to pure Mosaism as a bulwark of deism (p. 72). 444</page><page sequence="9">The Secret Religion of Germany Catholicism. Misunderstanding was fostered by the fact that fewer indulgences are needed in the chilly German climate than under the glowing Italian sky, and the paternal concern of Pope Leo X misled him into dispatching an oversupply of indulgences to the North. 1 No one will fail to notice that there was a good deal of cheerful mis- chief in Heine's thumbnail sketch of Christianity, and it is unnecessary to carry his exposition any further. But there is no reason to doubt that he did look forward to a time when Germany would recover its health and atone for the unnaturalness of Christian spiritualism. And he understood this to mean, in part, a recovery of the ancient religion practiced in northern Europe before the Christian missionaries arrived, which was not deism but pantheism: a form of nature worship in which everything was full of gods. When Christianity encountered the old Germanic religion, it put in the place of a divinized nature a nature infested with devils. Everything sacred became satanic, and Teutonic pan-theism became pan-demonism-until the philosophical revolution restored the contact of the German mind with its ancient sources.12 If Heine's understanding of deism was (to us) unusual, his view of pantheism was nothing less than singular. The philosophical panthe- ism that arose in Germany under the belated influence of Spinoza was partly, in his eyes, a revival of the old Germanic religious heritage. The innate pantheistic instinct of the German soul reasserted itself first, he believed, in German art, even before it became embodied in a philo- sophical theory; what the early Romantics wrongly felt as nostalgia for medieval Catholicism had an older, deeper source. Astonishingly, then, Heine not only collapsed Judaism, Christianity, and deism into a single religious conception but also viewed in one comprehensive glance the ancient Teutonic religion and modern German art, litera- ture, and philosophy. One would have thought it a giant step from the pleasant fantasy that a fairy breathes in every tree to Schelling's and Hegel's heavy philosophies of nature. But, for Heine, the old religion and the new speculation were alike manifestations of pantheism, and he predicted that the refined German philosophy of nature would eventually draw explosive political strength from the "demonic" (sic) 11 Ibid., p. 58; pp. 14-20; pp. 27-29. On the antithetical systems of spiritualism and sensual- ism, see also p. 49. In general, Heine professed admiration for Luther (pp. 27, 33-34), and he hailed the Reformation as the advent of that freedom of thought without which the philosophical revolution would have been impossible (pp. 36-37, 47). But he admired only the "spirit" of Protestantism and admitted that (institutionally) his own Protestantism consisted solely in having his name on the rolls of the Lutheran communion (p. 305, from the French version of his work on Germany). Compare Die romantische Schule (1835), in Historischkritische Gesamtausgabe (n. 1 above), vol. 8, pt.-vol. 1:143-44. Protestant accommodation to modern thought he considered in some respects suicidal; see his Briefe uber Deutschland, letter 1, p. 196. 12 Heine, Deutschland, pp. 17, 58-59; pp. 20, 26, 64. 445</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion energies of the old Germanic cult. A drama would then be played out in Germany in comparison with which the French Revolution would look like an innocuous idyll. The lust for battle would reassert itself, and old Thor would leap to life again to shatter the Gothic cathedrals with his hammer. France, beware!13 In Heine's mind, the "secret religion of Germany" had a long pedigree. But by his own time, it also held out something new. What Heine really wanted was not to believe that a fairy lurks in every tree, but that God is incarnate in the flesh of humanity. For while the deity of the pantheists is manifest in everything that is, in the totality of humankind deity attains to self-consciousness. And here Heine dis- covered the possibility of political and social revolution in Germany's revolution of the mind. Once brought to awareness of their own divinity, the people will be inspired to publish it abroad; and if true divinity claims even what is material as its domain, then the material welfare of all becomes a religious cause, including the welfare of the suffering whom the church had counseled to bear the cross in this world for the sake of blessedness in the world to come. This, then, is what captivated Heine about the new pantheism: in effect, the apotheosis of humanity. Spinoza's God, who is matter as well as spirit (extension as well as thought), the Hegelian concept of the identity of God and man, and the practical, protosocialist faith of the Saint-Simonians were all natural allies in the struggle for a better life. But the pantheistic Ger- mans had seen more clearly than the materialistic French that bread is not just the right of the people, but the divine right of humanity. Beneath Heine's eccentricity and his irrepressible frivolousness there hides an earnest social vision.14 Quite different from Heine's neopaganism was the wisdom that Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744-1803) drew from the Spinozist revival, closer to its source. He put his thoughts into dialogue form in his book God: Some Conversations (1787), perhaps the most interesting monument of the Spinozist revival. The intellectual ferment unwittingly occasioned by the quarrel between Jacobi and Mendelssohn is nowhere more strikingly mirrored than in these winsome, but often murky, dialogues. It must be admitted that the dialogue form is somewhat art- lessly employed. The revival systems are not permitted to speak, with- out partiality, for themselves; Theophron (clearly Herder himself) for 13 Ibid., p. 101; pp. 111, 115-16; pp. 118-19. Heine also saw anticipations of"our doctrine" in Giordano Bruno and, further back, in pre-Socratic philosophy (pp. 112, 115).

A third, female character, Theano, who appears toward the end, is likewise presented as eager for instruction, if more impatient than Philolaus of subtle speculation.15 Theophron will not admit that he is a Spinozist. However, his task is to set the record straight: to rectify misapprehensions about Spinoza, whose leading ideas he expounds with evident sympathy. By "God," the one substance of which all things are modifications, Spinoza meant the one self-dependent nature that no logical mind can deny. But this inde- pendent being was for him the immanent, not the "transitive," cause of all things: not, that is, a cause that breaks in occasionally from the out- side. Philolaus assents: to suppose that God is a transitive cause would imply that at other times there could be such a thing as a creature with- out God's support and that God himself must be subject to location and change. "But," asks Theophron, to test his pupil, "what if God dwells outside the world?" Philolaus: "Where is there a place outside the world?" Theophron: "Excellent, Philolaus." But Philolaus remains puz- zled, for what could Spinoza possibly have meant by making extension, along with thought, one of the two attributes of God? This seems hardly compatible with the insight that God "has no place." Does Spinoza, after all, enclose God within the world?16 Here Theophron admits that Spinoza went wrong; he was misled by Descartes, who defined matter in terms of extension and distinguished it sharply from spirit. In his drive for a monistic system, Spinoza thus found himself with one divine substance yet still with two utterly incon- gruous attributes: thought and extension. He lacked a "unifying inter- mediate conception." But, Theophron points out, truth marches on; natural science, without which metaphysics builds in the air, and the philosophy of Leibniz, our German philosopher, have now conspired to give us exactly the category we need, that of "substantial force," an indivisible active element. Philolaus grasps the point: Spinoza's system can be given the unity he vainly pursued if we hold thought to be simply the highest grade of organic force known to us. We will also know how to identify God in this panpsychic philosophy of process: God will be the primal force (Urkraft) in an organic system of forces, the soul of every soul.17 15 J. G.

Herder appropriates Spinoza's fundamental insight partly to save the idea of God by reconstructing it. The image of the divine being who sits above the circle of the earth and intervenes, now and then, in human destiny had fallen on hard times once nature had come to be perceived as moving in accord with its own immanent laws. The temptation was then to think of God either as turning his back on the world once he had made it or else as willfully disrupting its machinelike operation, which he himself had set in motion. And what kind of a choice was that-either to sacrifice the presence of God to the laws of nature or to jeopardize scientific inquiry by leaving nature open to the arbitrary intervention of God? The Neo- Spinozist resolved the dilemma by abandoning the image of the extra- mundane deity, the mind outside the machine. According to Herder, we cannot think any longer of God as a being who acts from outside the world on other beings, nor can we represent the divine activity as arbi- trary. Rather, God is precisely the luminous, rational necessity that discovers itself within nature to scientific inquiry. 18 But Herder was not merely interested in a sounder philosophical concept of God. Like Heine afterward, he was also concerned about what he took to be the defects of conventional Christian piety; only for Herder, the main problem lay not in Christian spiritualism, but in a naive egocentrism that wanted a deity at human disposal. In a some- what patronizing letter to Jacobi, he professed not to understand what "you dear people" mean by an existence of God outside the world; in another letter, he added pointedly: "You want God in human form, as a friend who thinks of you. Bear in mind that he must then also think of you in a human - that is, restrictive - way, and if he is partial to you, it will be against others."19 Herder's Conversations are a Neo-Spinozist antidote to a naive, self-centered piety. The true religious frame of mind unites with the sober devotion of the scientist or natural philo- sopher to the task of uncovering the nature of things. Piety is to grasp nature as a tissue of law-governed events. Empirical science, Theophron predicts, will one day exclude the last vestiges of divine arbitrariness. But this by no means excludes religion, too; it indicates what real reli- 18 Ibid., pp. 486-88, 493, 497, 500, 519. The identification of God as lichtvolle, denkende Nothwendigkeit is changed in the second edition to lichtvolle, wirkende Nothwendigkeit (p. 481), but in the passages cited Herder continued to speak of God as a "reason" or "intelligence" in things that may be called analogically "wise" and "beneficent" even though it must not be conceived of as strictly a person. Herder insists that Spinoza himself did not turn God into a gedankenloses Wesen (p. 474), for blind power (blinde Macht) cannot be the highest power (p. 479). 19 Herder to Jacobi, February 6, 1784, in Aus Herders Nachlass: Ungedruckte Briefe, ed.

For, good Theano, are we merely spectators? Are we not ourselves actors, Nature's coworkers, and her imitators?"20 The consciousness of divine necessity, we are told, banishes all senseless fear. But there is more to religion than this. Blessedness is attained in the individual's perception of him- or herself as belonging to the whole, sharing in a magnificent, unremitting process in which even death and destruction have their meaning. Philolaus offers the opinion that the old theologies are dying out, and Theophron replies: "The truth in them will prove itself incom- parably more glorious if we no longer snatch after special little pur- poses in every single little circumstance, but more and more achieve a view of the whole, which, down to its smallest combinations, is but a single system in which the wisest goodness reveals itself in accord with immutable, internal rules."21 III Jacobi has usually been dismissed as a sorry, second-rate philosopher (not quite justly, in my opinion). But at least he let a philosophical genie out of the bottle. It does not matter much whether he was right or wrong about Lessing. Heine thought Mendelssohn was right: "Rest easy in the grave, old Moses," he wrote, "your Lessing was no Spino- zist, as slander pretends; he died a good deist like you, and Nicolai, and Teller, and the Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek."22 Be that as it may (and even Heine admitted that Lessing was on the way to Spinozism), Jacobi's "slander" released a spirit that he was unable to control. The road from Wolfenbiittel could, and did, lead to more destina- tions than one: among others, to Herder's vision of the harmony of nature and to Heine's vision of a juster society, to admiration for the primal cosmic force and to the divinization of humanity. That pantheism is the secret religion of Germany turns out, as you may have surmised, to be too simple a revelation. But the different destinations did lie in a common direction, which led away from deism and the Enlightenment. Mendelssohn is sometimes proclaimed the victor in the Pantheism Controversy: whereas Jacobi emerges discredited because of his 20 Herder, Gott, pp. 490-91, 557-60. Herder clearly has no difficulty in using the language of religious devotion in speaking of his deity (see, e.g., pp. 562-63). 21 Ibid., p. 472; pp. 562-67; pp. 492-93. 22 Heine, Deutschland (n. 1 above), pp. 75-76. 449</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion fideism and the dubious tactics with which he defended it, Mendelssohn scores points for his image of unfailing civility and reasonableness. Yet "old Moses," as Heine called him, stood for the waning outlook of the German Enlightenment, which he had never represented with much originality. He wanted the Spinozist revival even less than Jacobi did. The immediate future in German philosophy lay neither with Jacobi's philosophy of faith nor with Mendelssohn's rational theism but with the varieties of speculative idealism that emerged, one might say, at the confluence of the Kantian philosophy and "Herderized" Spinozism. Jacobi and Mendelssohn fought over the grave of Spinoza only to discover that the body was still breathing. Historians of German philosophy trace back through the Spinozist revival to Spinoza himself the fundamental speculative principle that God is not the external, transient cause of things, working arbitrarily by free choice, but the internal cause that proceeds necessarily accord- ing to its own rational nature, so that the true revelation of God must be sought after in the eternal laws of the world order. Here, in "the fundamental thought of the inviolably regular order of the world," Otto Pfleiderer discerned the "sure foundation of all subsequent philosophy, and of the whole modern view of the world," needing only to be repre- sented in less static, more teleological terms.23 We may be inclined these days to regard this verdict as more parochial than Pfleiderer imagined. But the great creators of speculative idealism would them- selves have agreed with him. Hegel announced in his lectures on the history of philosophy: "Spinoza is the high point of modern philosophy; either Spinozism or no philosophy."24 To be sure, Hegel argued that absolute substance in Spinoza's philosophy was not yet conceived of as active, living Spirit but only as the abstract unity of Spirit in itself. This, however, was in effect a proposal to move the notion of divine substance in the direction Herder had already pointed out. The resulting concept-or perhaps one might better say, the result- ing image -of God approaches the ancient idea of the anima mundi, the "World Soul." Herder, like Schleiermacher afterward, expressed reser- vations about baptizing the originally pagan term since it could be said still to construe the relationship of God and world dualistically.25 But 23 Otto Pfleiderer, The Philosophy of Religion on the Basis of Its History, trans.

Nature is no longer a machine but an organism; God, accordingly, is not so much its orderer as its order or reason, not its artificer, but its creative life and activity. There remains, it is true, an obvious and important point of continuity between the older Newtonian theism (or deism) and Herder's "dynamic panentheism," as it has been called:27 for both, nature is law governed. But the anthropomorphic deity outside the law-governed system has now given way to an organic whole, the creative activity of which is what we mean by "God." The proposed shift of perspective not only lays aside the incurable anthropomorphism of the deists but also excludes the perennial temptation of the orthodox to assume that if he made the system, God may reserve to himself the right to interfere with it from time to time. For the Neo-Spinozist, the notion of divine inter- ference is simply impossible since the course of nature is nothing other than the necessary activity of God; not being outside the system, God can scarcely be thought to intervene in it. Revolutions of the mind, like revolutions in politics, are not irrevers- ible. In the preface to the second edition of his Religion and Philosophy in Germany, Heine disconcertingly forewarned the reader that everything the book said on the great question of God was as false as it was fool- hardy. "Deism lives.... It is not dead!" Between the first edition and the second, Heine (so he said) had undergone a conversion, which he attributed not to any miraculous divine intervention but simply to renewed study of the Bible. He had mocked at Schelling's conversion to the extramundane God of Catholicism. "It proves," he said, "only that a man inclines to Catholicism when he grows tired and old." Yet when he himself was disillusioned and racked with pain, Heine returned to what he cynically called "the old superstition of a personal God," though without taking refuge in any church. He was homesick for the God who, even if he dispenses no more comfort than the Olympian Zeus, can at least be rebuked for the cruelty and injustice of the world.

Heine symbolically threw into his fire an unfinished manuscript he was writing on Hegel.28 Still, even if a return to prerevolutionary deism (or theism) could not, and cannot, be ruled out, I want to suggest in conclusion that the conceptual possibilities of the anima mundi analogy are not yet exhausted, further, that it entails a reformulation of the fundamental religious question worth pondering even by those who decline to take the road to monism. Spinozism was something new in the history of ideas, but the theme of the World Soul was not, even if its credentials were less impressive in Christendom than those of the extramundane deity. In Western thought, Plato's cosmology had in fact allowed for both a Cosmic Artificer and a World Soul, and it is an interesting problem how he intended us to think of the relationship between the two. Similarly, in the religious thought of India, the qualified nondualism of Ramanuja represented the physical world and individual souls as together making up the body of Brahman, personalized as Vishnu. And if neither Ramanuja nor even Plato can command the highest authority among Christian theologians, remember that no less a doctor of the church than Thomas Aquinas thought the soul to be in the body as God is in the world, and that the Protestant Reformer Ulrich Zwingli could say: "God is in the world what reason is in a human."29 It is not my wish to collapse important conceptual differences into one vague analogy but simply to recall, by these few examples, that the anima mundi theme had a history before the Pantheism Controversy; it was neither wholly novel nor necessarily heretical. And, of course, other examples of its use could be given. The first of my two concluding suggestions, that this tradition is not yet exhausted, may be defended for now by an argument that is can- didly ad hominem: it should require no elaborate defense at the Uni- versity of Chicago, though it might elsewhere. One of Charles Harts- horne's early programmatic essays was published under the title, "The New Pantheism." He pointed out the advantages of the old pantheism over traditional theism and then tried to show how the new pantheism could dispose of the disadvantages of the old, which were its inability to secure either human freedom or divine personality and its apparent implication that God must be, on one side of his nature, material and lifeless. The new pantheism denies an absolute dualism of matter and 28 Heine, Deutschland, pp. 497-98; pp. 113-14; p. 499. See also Heinrich Heine's Autobiographie.

God is the whole of things, and the whole is personal.30 Over the years, as you know, the banner of the process theologians has been wisely changed from "the new pantheism" to "neoclassical theism." But the cardinal points remain the same. In his recent, lusty venture into philosophy of religion for nonspecialists, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes, Hartshorne expressly writes of God as the World Soul and continues to recommend the mind-body, or person-to- cells, analogy over the interpersonal metaphors of God as parent or ruler.31 A closely similar position is defended in a study published by a British author in the same year as Hartshorne's Omnipotence. In God's World, God's Body, Grace Jantzen argues that the usual objections to pantheism and the idea of God's embodiment in the world can be over- come, in large part, if theology will follow science and abandon the notion of inert matter as something wholly alien to thought or life. The replacement of the Platonic-Cartesian dualism with a holistic model of human personality calls for a fresh look at the notion of divine person- ality and divine embodiment. "The model of the universe as God's body," Jantzen concludes, "helps to do justice to the beauty and value of nature, the importance of conservation and ecological responsibility, the significance and dignity of the human body and sexuality." Quite the reverse of Heine's estimate of Christianity, Jantzen maintains that "denigration of the physical is not an option for Christian theology."32 She may well be right. But the notion of divine embodiment in the world is still strange to most of us, and since Hartshorne does not men- tion Herder, and Jantzen does not mention either Herder or Harts- horne, there is evidently plenty of room for better communication on the subject. Finally, what may the speculative turn toward monism imply for the concrete forms of the religious life? Hartshorne and Jantzen both have some interesting insights on the question. But the differences we have had occasion to note between Heine and Herder make it unlikely that we could discover any single religious vision arising out of the Panthe- ism Controversy, even if the controversy did set diverse thinkers moving along a common metaphysical course toward monism. For my second concluding suggestion, I take my cue only from Herder and 30 Charles Hartshorne, "The New Pantheism," Christian Register 115 (1936): 119-20, 141-43. I am grateful to Schubert Ogden for drawing this article to my attention. 31 Charles Hartshorne, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1984), pp. 51-63, 78-79, 122-23. 32 Grace Jantzen, God's World, God's Body (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1984), pp. 122, 148; p. 4; p. 156; p. 9. 453</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion return to his conversations on God. Theophron's philosophy-and he no doubt speaks for Herder himself-is "to concern oneself with the inner nature of things as they exist"; what excites him to something like religious wonder is the thought: "Beautiful, beneficent Necessity, under whose all-embracing sway we live! She is a child of highest wisdom, the twin sister of eternal might, the mother of all goodness, blessedness, security, and order." Theano agrees: God's nature, thoughts, activities press on us as immutable rules in thousand upon thousand proofs of his order, goodness, and beauty. "He who does not want to follow, must follow.... Happy he who follows willingly!"33 This is by no means all that Herder has to say about religion, and what he says here, in the Conversations, may strike us today as overhasty in identifying order with necessity. But notice, at a somewhat more general level, what his Spinozist inclinations imply for the fundamental religious quest: it is the quest for the place of humanity in the cosmos. Without saying so, Herder moves the religious goal closer to the ancient Chinese ideal of harmony with the forces of nature, or with their underlying principle or way. Although the Taoist sage might find Herder too energetic in searching out the ultimate reality, in their common desire for harmony with nature there is at least a convergence between East and West. The world of sense is no deceptive appearance to be transcended in thought, as in the strict nondualism of the Indian philosopher Sankara; it is a real world, to which we must adjust because it does not exist for our convenience but is simply the product of the Eternal Order. To find a niche for humanity in the cosmos may sound like an obvious enough formulation of the religious quest. But it was not the quest of the dominant form of piety in Herder's Germany. Protestant Pietism had nurtured an intensely inward, private, emotional reli- giousness, centered on the ever-repeated experience of guilt and forgiveness. In Herder, at least, to say nothing for now of others, the Spinozist revival was a revolution in spirituality no less than in meta- physics. But might one be able to take the reformulated religious ques- tion without the metaphysical monism that suggested it? Even within traditional Protestantism, there had been one reformer for whom the primary religious question was not "How can I get a gracious God?" but "What is the chief end of human life?" Perhaps that other Genevan was led to his answer by his profound sense of awe before the divine "wisdom, justice, goodness, and power" mirrored in created beings. He even thought it possible for a pious mind to say that nature is God, although, as we all know, he was not much inclined to divinize human- 33 Herder, Gott, p. 487; pp. 472-73; p. 563. 454</page><page sequence="19">The Secret Religion of Germany ity. For him, humanity was not the point at which God came to self- consciousness, but the point at which the creation came to mirror the glory of God in a conscious act of piety.34 "What is the chief end of human life?"John Calvin answers that God has placed humans in the cosmos to be glorified in them; in this their chief end and their highest good alike consist.35 And when I read that austere but eloquent answer, I realize what you may have always suspected: I remain an honest Calvinist. 34 John Calvin, Institutio Christianae religionis (Geneva, 1559) 1.14.21; 1.5.5.
