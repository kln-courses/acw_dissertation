FELDMAN1 INTEREST IN THE historical roots of Western humanism has led the authors of this article to the discovery that, on the one hand, Josephus did not mention the concept of the creation of man in God's image, and that, on the other hand, he frequently mentioned slaves.2 Among the questions that have arisen are these: did he 1 This article was originally written by John G. Gibbs and has been extensively revised by Louis H. Feldman. 2 Cf. Karl H. Rengstorf, ed., A Complete Concordance to Flavius Josephus, 4 vols. (Leiden, 1973-83). The Josephus parallel to Gen. 1:26-27 (A 1. 1. 1. 32) does not mention the creation of man in God's image, presumably because such a statement had anthropomorphic connotations. In A 12. 2. 2. 23, the clause "because all men are the handiwork (nlqgto6pyr,La) of God" replaces the Letter of Aristeas' claim that God "favors men who pray with pure motives" (so Ralph Marcus in the Loeb Classical Library edition, VII, 14, n. a). Josephus, in his summary of Jewish laws in Books 3 and 4 of the Antiquities, totally omits a number of references to the heathen slave (Exod. 21: 20-21, Lev. 25: 44-46) and to the Israelite slave (Exod. 21: 6, Lev. 25: 47-54, Deut. 15: 12-18); and only once (Ap 2. 30. 215) does he mention that the law is no less inexorable for classes of slaves as it is for freedmen. See Marcus Olitzki, "Der jiidische Sklave nach Josephus und der Halacha," Magazin fir die Wissenschaft des Judenthums 16 (1889): 74, who explains Josephus' omission of the humanitarian attitude of Jews toward slaves by remarking that Josephus intended to write a special work on the laws (A 1. Proem 4. 25; 1. 1. 1. 29; 20. 12. 1. 268) and hence presented merely a brief mention here; but we may remark that he is far from cursory in presenting other aspects of the law. Essenes, we are told (A 18. 1. 5. 21), do not own slaves in order to avoid the temptation that they would be subjected to as masters to act unjustly toward others. Josephus shows no knowledge, so far as we can tell, of Job 31: 15, "Did not He who made me in the womb make him [the slave] also? And did not One fashion us in the womb?," although we must note that Josephus is writing history and hence makes no mention at all of the Book of Job. It is nonetheless surprising, considering Josephus' considerable knowledge of Stoicism (see my "Josephus as a Biblical Interpreter: the 'Aqedah," JQR 75 [1985]: 222-24) and his general apologetic strain, that he makes no mention of the Stoic view that man has been made free by God (Epictetus, ap. Arrian 4. 17. 16), that slaves are to be treated as fully human (cf. Seneca, Epistles 47. 1), that there should be no distinction between Greek and barbarian, slave and freeman, that the slave is capable of virtue and worthy of the friendship of the free (Seneca, De Beneficiis 3. 18. 2, Epistles 31. 11), that every human being is a member of an all-embracing common world, and that the wise</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW usually tell us whether an individual was a born slave, a bought slave, a half-slave, a freed slave, a hired servant, or a bondman?3 did he have a systematic view of slavery at the time of the Second Jewish Commonwealth? did he allege any notable differences between Jewish and Roman practices and institutions of slavery? man alone is free. Nor does Josephus, despite his manifest knowledge of Rabbinic traditions generally, make mention of the obvious parallels with the status and duties of slaves in other parts of the Roman Mediterranean, as noted by Martin Goodman, State and Society in Roman Galilee A.D. 132-212 (Totowa, New Jersey, 1983), pp. 37-38, nor of the Rabbinic dicta intended to ameliorate the treatment of slaves. See Solomon Zeitlin, "Slavery during the Second Common- wealth and the Tannaitic Period," JQR 53 (1962): 185-218. 3 These distinctions are suggested by general studies of slavery in antiquity, although, as Moses I. Finley, Economy and Society in Ancient Greece (New York, 1982), p. 141, remarks, despite the fact that the evidence is unmistakable that in all sorts of terminology concerning slavery the Greeks recognized the existence of half-way statuses, they did not seek, let alone achieve, a systematic analysis. Boaz Cohen, Jewish and Roman Law (New York, 1966), pp. 159-78, for instance, distinguishes a bondman (a person with legal rights but also bound by law to render service to another) from a slave ("the absolute property of the master, possessed as a chattel, or owned as a thing"); cf. p. 160. One of the problems in the compre- hensive presentation attempted by William L. Westermann, The Slave Systems of Greek and Roman Antiquity (Philadelphia, 1955) is the lack of attention to the various kinds of freedom and half-freedom among persons. Primary sources for the study of slavery in antiquity are listed by Reginald H. Barrow, Slavery in the Roman Empire (London, 1928), Appendix I, pp. 237-46; and Frank M. Snowden, Blacks in Antiquity (Cambridge, Mass., 1970), "Index of Sources," pp. 353-64. Incidentally, Snowden concludes that there was no "color line" among Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians in antiquity. Surveys of research and problems in this field are given by Moses I. Finley, ed., Slavery in Classical Antiquity: Views and Controversies (Cambridge, 1960), includ- ing "Bibliographical Essay," pp. 229-35; and Joseph Vogt, Sklaverei und Humani- tat: Studien zur antiken Sklaverei und ihrer Erforschung (Historia Einzelschriften, 8) (Wiesbaden, 1965); English translation: Ancient Slavery and the Ideal of Man (Cambridge, Mass., 1975).

It will do so in two sections: first by attention to word statistics and meanings, and second by attention to metaphorical uses of terms pertaining to slavery. I. WORD MEANINGS AND STATISTICS Four procedures will be used here to determine what Josephus meant when he used words concerning slavery that were available David Farbstein, Das Recht der unfreien und der freien Arbeiter nach jiidisch- talmudischem Recht (verglichen mit dem antiken, speciell mit dem romischen Recht) (Frankfurt a. M., 1896), who distinguishes between unilateral and bilateral arrangements between employers and employees (Chapters 5 and 6), and who concludes with an apologetic for Judaism: "Das r6mische Recht war ein 'Herren- recht'... Das jtidische Recht war ein 'Arbeiterrecht"' (p. 69); c) Ephraim E. Urbach, "Halakhot regarding Slavery as a Source for the Social History of the Second Temple and the Talmudic Period" [Hebrew], Zion 25 (1960): 141-89; and d) a correction by Zeitlin, (above, note 2) to the overly apologetic approach.

(a) First, Josephus' use of these terms has been examined with the following results: Prisoners of war, captives in battle whose lives had been spared, were usually designated as aiXak0tco)oT (cf. aiXgIakcooia, aiXuakcoTilo)). These, when sold, became the prop- erty of the purchaser.6 It was possible to be captured but not treated as a slave (cf. Josephus' own experience, Jewish War [hereafter W] 3. 8. 9. 405-408), so that one cannot be certain in all cases that an aiX6wak)oS was in fact a slave. But enslavement occurred so often that the prospect of being captured in war filled one with terror (W 4. 2. 4. 107); it could even eventuate in crucifixion (Life [hereafter L] 75. 420), and the captivity itself (W 1. 16. 4. 311; A 1 1. 1. 1) could just as readily be termed "slavery" (68oukiaq, A 10. 4. 5. 68; 14. 15. 5. 429; 11. 1. 1. 2). Incidentally, the "capture" of the ark is described metaphorically as aitCaXwocia in A 5. 11. 3. 357; 6.. 1.4. The 6bo6Xoq group of words appears most frequently to desig- nate slaves rather than hired servants. To be enslaved (8oueUhtEV) means submission to others, frequently to foreign conquerors (Against Apion [hereafter Ap] 2. 11. 125-28). The slave (86oi)o) is the opposite of the master (6EonO6Trl), as in Joseph's dream about his brothers' wheat sheaves bowing down before his own wheat sheaf (A 2. 2. 2. 11). The distinction between slave and or more separate works of Josephus agree, or when it has been possible to set aside any motivations that Josephus may have had for varying from Biblical sources in his paraphrases of them. 5 Translations are those in the Loeb Classical Library edition unless otherwise noted. The chronology of Josephus' writings is succinctly stated by Henry St. J. Thackeray, Josephus, vol. 1 (Loeb Classical Library) (Cambridge, Mass., 1966). 6 Cf. the discussion by Mendelsohn (above, note 3), pp. 389-90. 287</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW servant is emphasized in reference to the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, who were "in no way slaves but subordinates" (6oiXat Jlsv o56aicog 6irno tTayLPivatl 6, A 1. 19. 7. 303). The relation of the 6boIos words to other words is, however, unclear, so that the 8ok?og terms do not have the consistent meaning that the above statements, standing alone, would suggest. For instance, in the list of returning exiles boXot designates Temple servants, but 0BpanovTes regularly designates those ser- vants who accompanied the exiles who returned to Jerusalem (A 11. 3. 10. 70-72). On the other hand, in the accounts of Herod sending a servant to signal to the military tribunes that they are to kill Malichus, Josephus describes that servant as oiKEcTi; in W 1. 11. 8. 233, but as 0?pa6(ov in A 14. 11. 6. 291. In fact, comparison of the parallel material in A 13-20 and W 1-2 shows that such words were used without fixed precise meanings. To be sure, there are, as one would expect, some cases in which Josephus consistently retains in the Antiquities the word that he used in the War, e.g.: 6boXeia (W . 3. 1. 70 = A 13. 11. 1. 301), bo6Xi (W1. 24.5. 484 = A 16. 7. 3. 194; W1. 30. 3. 586 = A 17.4. 1.64), 6oiXo (W2. 3. 1.41 =A 17. 10. 1.252; W2.4.2. 57 = A 17. 10. 6. 273); av6panobicc (W1.8. 9. 180 = A 14. 7. 3. 120; W2. 5. 1. 68 = A 17. 10. 9. 289). On the other hand, there are many changes, e.g.: 6tEouXoCoEvov (W 1. 12. 5. 243) becomes KcXEcipozTo (A 14. 13. 1. 324); aiXpta.coxia (W 1. 16. 4. 311) becomes 6ouXesia (A 14. 15. 5. 429); oiKcrST (W1. 11. 8. 233, 1. 32. 1. 620) becomes 0OpanovTa (A 14. 11. 6. 291) or bo6Xot (A 17. 5. 3. 93); oi 0cpa7ncrovTEg (W 1. 33. 5. 658) becomes oiKCTO)V (A 17. 6. 5. 172); 0cpanraiva (W 1. 30. 2. 584) becomes 6bouXa (A 17. 4. 1. 64); 0epacnatvi; (W 1. 32. 6. 641) becomes ?6o680igu (A 17. 5. 7. 141). There is, of course, no necessary contradiction between describing the same person as boUXog, oiK?rrcxq, or Oepditcov, since these terms, originally at least, as we have noted, indicated differ- ent but not necessarily mutually exclusive aspects of slavery. The fact that the meaning is not usually clear from the context and that, to judge from the papyri, the terms were increasingly regarded as mere synonyms would seem to contradict the view that Josephus is using them in their precise senses. Moreover, the very subordinates who robbed priests of the tithes which sustained them are described in the same Greek sentence by the two words oiKETrzr and 68okoS (A 20. 9. 2. 206f.). 288</page><page sequence="9">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN There is the further possibility of confusion between oiKcsTv and OiKEic)V ("citizens," A 13. 13. 3. 359). Can it be that oiKirat means only "domestic slaves," those more closely associated with the household as an economic unit (as opposed to day laborers), who thus had a closer relationship with their owner? Throughout the Joseph story (A 2; cf. especially 2. 4. 1. 39 and 2. 4. 5. 56f. and 2. 6. 7. 126-130) this appears to be the case, as Joseph, the bought slave, is referred to as the 8oiko who in turn has his own "domestic" (oiK?Trl;s). On the other hand, Josephus' contrast between conquered Canaanites and Hebrews, of whom none was a slave during Solomon's reign, is the con- trast between oiKErcciav and o60oucuev respectively (A 8. 6. 3. 161-162). Submission to the foreign conqueror was described, then, either with bo6Xos words or with oiKTrTS words, so that oiKceTXrl need not mean only domestic slavery, particularly since the Canaanites labored outdoors tilling the soil and doing other menial tasks (A 8. 6. 3. 160). Did Josephus employ only 6boios words to describe the Hebrews' service to God, a concept that was so prominent in his Biblical sources?7 Such an expectation could arise from Josephus' explanation to readers unacquainted with Hebrew that the son of Ruth and Boaz was named Obed, "for Cobed in the Hebrew tongue signifies 'one who serves'" (6ouXV6U0V, A 5. 9. 4. 336). However, Josephus (A 8. 6. 3. 162), as we have noted above, emphasizes that no Hebrew was a slave (o603oEcuv) during Solomon's reign, (a statement which implies merely that Solomon was a just king and not a tyrant), although the Canaanites were enslaved by him (A 8. 6. 3. 161), a contrast that was stated already in Gen. 9:25. In the Masoretic text this verse depicts Canaan as a slave of slaves (cebed Cabadim) "to his brothers," and the Septuagint has it that Canaan was both servant (tacl) and slave (oiK?Tr;).8 Further, as Rengstorf 7 Exod. 20: 5, in its prohibition of serving other gods (tacabedem), implies that all Israel is to serve God as His cabadim (slaves). The righteous man is the 8oi6og 0?co (Septuagint, Ps. 18: 12, 14; 26: 9; 30: 17, etc.). For Isaiah Israel is the cebed of God. Subsequently the Masada defenders were determined to serve (oiEUeIctv) none other than God (W 7. 323). Hebrew 'ebed is translated in the Septuagint by 6oikog (314 times) or ncaL (336 times), not to mention oiK?T1Tr (35 times) and Ospd6tov (42 times); cf. Karl H. Rengstorf, "Aoi3Xog," in Gerhard Kittel, ed., Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (Grand Rapids, 1964) 2:265-69. 8 That indeed the distinction between naLS and oiKECTrl on the one hand, and 6oi)kog on the other hand, had been lost by the first century C.E., seems clear from 289</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW observes, it did not serve Josephus' apologetic purposes to describe Hebrews often as 6oikor Tzo 0Osoi (cf. A 11. 4. 4. 90 and 11. 4. 6. 101 for two rare instances).9 Thus these preliminary comparisons between Josephus' use of slave terms, demonstrate no precise meaning for a given term, nor any careful verbal distinctions between various kinds of slaves or between other subservients. This finding may not be surprising in the light of the evidence that the earlier distinction in Judges-2 Kings between nTca and 6oDogs was lost in the later books of the Septuagint, wherein the two literary complexes of Genesis-Joshua and Judges-2 Kings "begin to fuse."10 If such fusion is already evident in the Septuagint, it is no wonder that one finds lack of clarity in the Greek words concerning slavery that were used by Josephus, for his native language was Aramaic or Hebrew (W 1. proem, 1, 9).1 (b) The second method for determining what Josephus meant in his slavery vocabulary is to inquire what these words meant when used by Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, and Dio- nysius of Halicarnassus, who were historians with whose writings Josephus was familiar. Since the Greek language did not remain static during the five or six centuries from Herodotus and Thu- cydides to Josephus, any results would not admittedly determine by themselves our understanding of Josephus. Dionysius of Hali- carnassus (first-century B.C.E.) is a colleague much closer in time the fact that Philo twice in the same treatise (De Sobrietate 7. 32 and 51) uses the language of the Septuagint (nxaiS oiKcETnS) and once (De Sobrietate 12. 59) uses 6oioq 8o6toXv. We may note that the manuscripts in De Sobrietate 7. 32 have all three terms-7rcai, oiKeTrlg, and 6oOkoS 6o6XcOv, and Wendland, in his edition of the text of Philo, regards the last two words as interpolated. Aquila in the second century, apparently saw no distinction between the Canaanite slave and the Hebrew slave in this respect and renders cebed Cabadim (in Gen. 9: 25) as 68oiko 6o6ucov. 9 Rengstorf (above, n. 7), p. 268, n. 48. 10 Walther Zimmerli, "nalS Oesoi," in Gerhard Kittel, ed.

It stresses the property aspect (it is parallel to TcTpantoov, a beast) in contrast to 8oi6Xos, which stresses the personal element. Modrzejewski14 has noted that av6pato8ov is the technical term for slave in the juridical language of Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, 12 Louis H. Feldman, Studies in Judaica: Scholarship on Philo and Josephus (1937-1962) (New York, 1963), p. 49, states that Josephus is rather close to Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his approach to historiography. See also Feldman (above, n. 11), pp. 407-08. Thackeray (above, n. 11), p. 56, is persuaded that Josephus intended his Jewish Antiquities to be a counterpart to Dionysius' Roman Antiquities, which also consisted of twenty books, and which had been produced about a century prior to Josephus' work. Josephus' historical sources are discussed by Thackeray, pp. 59-66, 69-70, 81-86, and 120; Feldman (above, n. 11), pp. 392- 419; and David J. Ladouceur, "Studies in the Language and Historiography of Flavius Josephus" (Ph.D. dissertation, Brown University, 1977). Ladouceur, "The Language of Josephus," Journalfor the Study of Judaism 14 (1983): 18-38, casts doubt on the theory of Josephus' dependence on Dionysius by noting that many of the words allegedly borrowed from Dionysius are actually found in the Septuagint and in other sources. Gustav Holscher, "Josephus," Realencyklopddie der klassi- schen Altertumswissenschaft, ed. August Pauly and Georg Wissowa (Stuttgart, 1916), 9:1963-69, discusses all of Josephus' literary sources. 13 Henry G. Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford, 1940), is, however, we must say, an inadequate lexicon for the Hellenistic period, as has been shown by Ladouceur in his dissertation and in his article (above, n. 12). On the terms 6oiBo;, o6ta, avpip6no8ov, and oiK6clgT see Straus, Actes (above, n. 3), pp. 335-50. Cf. Finley (above, n. 3), p. 134: "The Greeks had too many slave words. As Collinet showed in an analogous situation, regarding the Roman colonists, such a profusion of terminology is likely to mirror historical reality." To be sure, Joseph D. Amusin, "The Terms for Slave in Hellenistic Egypt according to the Data of the Septuagint" [Russian], Vestnik Drevnei Istorii 3 (1952): 46-67, concludes, through a comparison of the Greek words designating slaves in the Septuagint with the words of the Hebrew original, that there is a difference in the usage of these terms in relation to the function of the social position of the slaves; but this precision may well be due to the fact that the Septuagint is a translation of a sacred and legal text, the Torah, where greater precision is demanded. 14 J. Modrzejewski, ap. Straus, Actes (above, n. 3), p. 347.</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW as it had been in Athens. Westermanns5 remarks that the term av6painoov, which, he notes, is legally clear and admissible, was gradually displaced by 6ovXog, though it was consistently used in the verbal and adjectival forms and in noun compounds. In particular, from a papyrus fragment (P. Columbia, Inv. 480, line 2), dating from 198-197 B.C.E., he concludes that the word &amp;vbpa- 7inoov is used as a general word for slave and does not seem to differ from boiXog. Modrzejewski'6 remarks that it is very striking that there are in fact two vocabularies, one a daily and familial one which appears in private letters, and the other an official termi- nology which is used in public acts. Indeed, Dunand17 has raised the question whether the ambiguity of terminology reflects the status of half-slave. More likely, we may suggest, the alternation in terminology reflects merely the use of synonyms. Thus, for example, Straus18 cites a papyrus where the person is called 6oiXog and inatbaptov, which is still another term for a slave. The meaning of war captive appears to be likely for most, possibly all, occurrences of the word &amp;avpanro5ov in Josephus' writings.19 The word has a pejorative connotation, indeed one of contempt; it and its related word, avapo7o6toci6Sq, are associated with devastation, ravage, and ruin (B4. 7. 1. 394; A 2. 10. 2. 248; 14. 15. 8. 443; 18. 9. 6. 353). 2) For Xenophon boulcE)t could describe not only being a slave but also metaphorical servitude. This dual meaning is also true of 6boXos, which originally20 refers to those who are born with a servile nature, that is, are natural slaves in Aristotelian terms, as opposed to those of a noble nature who have been enslaved by misfortune. As the word became applied indiscriminately to all 15 William J.

In the other occurrences of 6o6Xrl in Homer (Odyssey 4. 12) it is not clear whether the reference is to one who was born a slave or one who was made a slave. Thucydides (8. 28), however, clearly distinguishes those who have been captives (&amp;v6bpdjroa) and are slaves (5of,a) and those who are free (cXeuOepa). 292</page><page sequence="13">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN slaves, Herodotus and others frequently used words of the 8oi)?ko group for nations subjected to a despot. This word-group desig- nates in a general fashion people who are in the power of others and are, therefore, not free; but-as we see in the New Testament,21 for example-the word 65oiBo lacks precision as to the juridical condition and is employed in the most varied ways, so that it is often impossible to discern whether an actual slave is meant or a servant. The 6oiXoS words function in the same way in Josephus (W2. 16. 4. 377; 4. 5. 4. 344; 4. 7. 2. 402; 5. 9. 4. 389; A 5. 4. 3. 197-198; 6.9. 1. 173; 8. 10.3.260; 10.4.5.68; 10. 7. 3. 113; 18. 1.1. 4; Ap 2. 11. 125). Accordingly, the 8oikog words do not distin- guish between slaves and servants; but most uses of these words by Josephus appear in context to be referring to those who had been enslaved by conquerors.22 Moreover, Josephus does not distin- guish in his terminology between Jewish and non-Jewish slaves. Jewish slaves are termed 8oikot (A 3. 12. 3. 282; A 4. 8. 28. 273; 16. 1. 1. 3), as are non-Jewish slaves. Again, Josephus (A 4. 8. 27. 272) uses the same term (8oXoos) for the one who becomes a slave through inability to pay for his theft as for the one who becomes a slave in war. 3) ?cpaniia had wide applications at the hands of the Greek historians, but without reference to slaves, except in a collective sense meaning "body of attendants, retinue." The collective mean- ing does not occur in the Jewish War but does appear six times in the Antiquities (5. 1. 15. 48; 6. 13. 8. 308; 7. 8. 5. 188; 14. 13. 7. 353; 18. 8. 3. 269; 19. 1. 15. 116). Herodotus uses Oepaitov for "servant," although it had also meant "henchman" or "companion in arms" since Homer, meaning one who stuck by an aristocratic man in war or peace. The first meaning of OpacT)OV that is listed in Rengstorf's concordance to Josephus is "attendant, servant (mainly from one's immediate company), valet."23 According to Josephus, Herod (W1. 13. 7. 264; A 14. 11. 6. 291), Aristobulus (A 13. 16. 5. 422), and Elisha (A 9. 4. 3. 55), to mention only a few, had their own indispensable attendant or slave, who appears to 21 See Spicq (above, n. 3), p. 204. 22 See Rengstorf (above, n. 7), pp. 264-83; Gerhard Sass, "Zur Bedeutung von 8oiXoo bei Paulus," Zeitschrift fir die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft 40 (1941): 24-32; Spicq (above, n. 3), pp. 204-14; J.

The cpantcov, in Josephus as in the Septuagint, usually is on terms of intimacy and confidence with his master, and his position implies a certain dignity, as Spicq24 has noted. Sometimes the 0cpadovTSg are servants (W 3. 4. 2. 69) who accompany a king in battle, who have the military bearing to be combatants, and who distinguish themselves with their skill and courage in battle. We may sound here a note of caution, however, as does Westermann,24a who says that we must be careful in translating such words as 0epa6cov, oiKcKTr,, nai; and nrat6aptov, which have fundamentally a signifi- cance other than "slave" but are often loosely employed by ancient writers in that sense. 4) OiKc'Trq occurs in Herodotus and Thucydides in the sense of "household slave" and in the generic as "household" (= oiKc- Tsia).25 He shares in the joys and sorrows of his master's house and nurses him when he is ill. He knows best what is going on in the house. "The most trusted of his servants" (TOv nto6TOTaTov TCOV oiKTCxv) or a similar expression is a recurrent phrase in Josephus, describing an oiKcTqgS of Abraham, who sought Rebekah as a wife for Isaac (A 1. 16. 1. 242); an Ethiopian princess who proposed marriage to Moses (A 2. 10. 2. 252); Saul, when he went to the witch of Endor (A 6. 14. 2. 330); the escaping Syrian king Adados (A 8. 14. 4. 384); Alexandra attempting to escape with her son in two coffins to Egypt (A 15. 3. 2. 46-47), etc. On the other hand, precisely because of his trusted position, an oiKG?Tnr was in a position to betray his master (A 10. 4. 1. 47; 11. 6. 4. 207). In any case, Josephus does not confine the oiKc'Tlg to situations of domesticity and intimacy: some were outdoors tilling the soil and performing menial tasks (A 8. 6. 3. 160).26 Moreover, Josephus 24 Spicq (above, n. 3), p. 216. 24a Westermann (above, n. 3), p. 5. 25 Cf. Kenneth C. Russell, "Slavery as Reality and Metaphor in the Non- Pauline New Testament Books," Revue de l'Universite d'Ottawa (1972), pp. 439- 69, especially p. 443, n. 5, who remarks that oiKTzrlS is almost a synonym of 6okoS,, but that while the latter term emphasizes the slave's dependence upon his master, the former term stresses the slave's position from the viewpoint of an outsider. 26 See Erich Klaar, "AoiDOog und oiKzTnS," Philologische Wochenschrift 43 (1925): 525-28. 294</page><page sequence="15">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN refers to the same royal servants as oiKeT(0v (A 12. 4. 9. 215) and as Ocpa6RovTcS (A 12. 4. 9. 216), thus confirming the trend that we find in other sources, where 0p6Tc0ov likewise took on the same mean- ing as oiKTrcn.27 In the papyri, as noted by Spicq,28 the otiKTXrl is a 8boiXoq; and in literature the term is often (e.g., in Philo, Quod deterius potiori insidiari soleat 13) a synonym of irnlp?T'nZ;. But Strauss29 has noted that the word oiKiT|q applies as well to free servants as to slaves. That Josephus does not distinguish between oiKxrTSq and boiXog seems evident from the fact that in his close paraphrase of the Letter of Aristeas, he (A 12. 2. 2. 20) has 8oU?U06vrT(v, whereas the latter (15) has ?v oiKETiat;. 5) nIaticKTcq, the diminutive of taig, usually means a young girl or a maiden, as we find, for example, in Xenophon, the historian (Anabasis 4. 3. 11) at the beginning of the fourth century B.C.E., and thereafter. Simultaneously, at an even earlier time, however, to judge from extant literature, it had acquired the pejorative connotation of a prostitute, as we can see from the fifth century historian Herodotus (1. 93). The meaning "young female slave" or "bondmaid" is found in the fifth century orator Lysias (1. 12, 13. 67) and in the papyri from the third century B.C.E. (P. Cairo Zenon 142), as well as in the New Testament (Gal. 4:22). There are only two occurrences in Josephus of naticiKTl, "young woman of marriageable age" (A 4. 8. 23. 248), and "slave girl," who at that time was a royal concubine (A 18. 2. 4. 40). 6) The word nait is used in Greek literature in the sense of "child."30 Its first occurrence in extant literature, according to Liddell-Scott's Greek lexicon, with the meaning of "slave" or "servant" is in the fifth century B.C.E. in Aeschylus (Choephoroe 653) and in Aristophanes (Acharnians 395); and it appears with this meaning frequently thereafter. Finley31 has remarked on the dehumanizing connotation of the term, which had its counterpart 27 So Norbert Brockmeyer, Antike Sklaverei (Darmstadt, 1979), p. 106. 28 Spicq (above, n. 3), p. 218, n. 4. 29 Straus, Actes (above, n. 3), p. 337. 3 On 7aig see August Hug, "HIaiicS," Realencyclopidie der klassischen Alter- tumswissenschaft, Supplementband 8 (Stuttgart, 1956): 374-400, especially p. 374, who notes that the term is particularly found with reference to domestic servants. 31 Moses I. Finley, Ancient Slavery and Modern Ideology (New York, 1980), p. 96. Aristophanes (Wasps 1297-1298, 1307), as Finley notes, invents an ety- mology for this term from the word ntaictv, "to beat," a joke which points to a harsh reality. 295</page><page sequence="16">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW in the antebellum South of the United States. In the War Josephus uses the word naTi 101 times (107 times, counting alternate readings) but only three times in the sense of "slave" (1. 3. 6. 82 [bis], 1. 17. 7. 340).32 It appears 772 times (775 times, counting alternate readings) in the Antiquities, ten times (7. 13. 4. 330; 8. 15. 5. 414; 11. 2. 1. 22;33 12. 4. 9. 209; 12. 4. 9. 217; 13. 11. 3. 314; 13. 11. 3. 315; 14. 15. 13. 463; 18. 6. 6. 192; 18.6.6. 193) in the sense of slave and four other times (5. 8. 12. 315; 6. 11. 8. 232; 6. 11. 8. 233; 6. 11. 10. 240) possibly in this sense. The word appears 21 times in the Life, only once (44. 223) in the sense of "slave" or "servant," and seven times in the treatise Against Apion, never in this sense. The word is obviously imprecise, as Straus34 has remarked; and we may note that in documents intended for officials the sender employs the unambiguous terms avSpano8ov, 6oiXo) , and opcpa 6outcIKO to avoid all confusion. Indeed, during the Roman period the word nati largely disappears from the papyri.35 7) The word oiL,a, in combination with other words, appears as early as the fourth century B.C.E. with reference to slaves. Thus Demosthenes (20. 77) speaks of aitXpiakota c iopaa, as does an inscription from Amorgos of the third century B.C.E.; and Xeno- phon (Hellenica 2. 1. 19) speaks of the opposite, X?c60epa o(oCaTa. Starting with the third century B.C.E. Gogxa is used absolutely for a slave (Hibeh Papyri 1. 54. 20), and it appears in literary texts from Xenophon in the fourth century B.C.E. (Cyropaedia 7. 5. 73) on. The word oadpa occurs 147 times (or 148 times, counting alternate readings) in Josephus, but has the meaning of "slave" only nine times (A 12. 1. 3. 28 [bis]; 12. 1. 3. 31; 12. 1. 3. 33; 12. 4. 1. 156; 13. 12. 4. 337; 14. 12. 5. 321 [bis]; L 75. 418). All of these refer to prisoners taken in war. It is significant, we may note, that 32 Pollux (7. 78) is certainly wrong in restricting the use of naic for slave to the fifth and fourth century B.C.E. Attic writers, since it is, as we see, occasionally used in this sense by Josephus. 33 Here we may note that the Septuagint (Ezra 4:7) reads o(uv6bo6otq; and Josephus, paraphrasing and imprecise in his terminology, reads 8oUXot. The reading nai6eg of some of the manuscripts is clearly an attempt to accord with the Septuagint. Rengstorf, we may note, errs in ascribing the meaning of "servant" to nais in A 16. 7. 4. 207. 34 Straus, Actes (above, n. 3), p. 338. 35 On the term ncatS as referring to a slave see I.

As noted above, Demosthenes uses a similar phrase. Indeed, Westermann36 has noted that the word ciupa alone was not sufficiently explicit for legal use, although, as stated above, it sometimes appears singly with the meaning of "slave" in the loose usage of classical authors. During the Roman period, as Straus37 has noted, an attempt was made in papyri to make more precise the significance of the terms caicpa and cCop(aztov by qualifying them more often than previously by the adjectives ouXtrKOV and 6ouXov. 8) The word 67rlpeTrl; is used in Herodotus, in Greek tragedy, and in Attic literature generally to refer to an underling, a servant, or an attendant, and indeed to all kinds of subordinate relations, as, for example, the role of Hermes as servant of the gods, without necessarily indicating outright slavery. In Josephus the word occurs 23 times, usually with the meaning of "attendant, accom- plice, instrument, minister, supporter, helper, officer." In three instances (A 15. 7. 7. 242; 15. 8. 4. 287; Ap 2. 31. 230) it has the meaning of "servant," though it is not clear whether or not the reference is to slaves. One is left with the impression that usually, when these terms are used by Josephus and by the other historians mentioned, they refer to real slaves rather than to hired servants, but without further discriminating between various kinds of slaves. Josephus did not, apparently, view these words as exact or technical terms. (c) The suggestion arises, thirdly, that Josephus' comments about slaves might stand out more clearly in comparison with the Septuagint, at least insofar as Josephus may have used a Greek text closely akin to our Septuagint. Since the strongest evidence that Josephus used a Greek text exists for his treatment of 1 Samuel-2 Kings in Jewish Antiquities 5. 10. 1. 338-10. 9. 2. 162, it makes sense to begin by comparing some words concerning 36 Westermann (above, n. 3), p. 5. 37 Straus, Actes (above, n. 3), p. 337. 297</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW slavery in that block of material.38 By using as a test sample the 6boXos group of words in Rengstorf's concordance to Josephus one discovers as follows: 1) Of the fifteen occurrences of 6ouXia in A 5. 10. 1. 338-10. 9. 2. 162, ten are paraphrases and/or additions that have no exact parallel in the Septuagint,39 and two refer to material other than 1 Samuel-2 Kings. A 8. 8. 1. 213 and 1 Kings 12:4 both use 6ouX,ia (twice in A 8. 8. 1. 213). According to A 9. 4. 2. 47, the widow and both her sons were enslaved (pp6g; 6ouveiav). 2 Kings 4:1 has only the two sons made so6?,oug. A 6. 5. 6. 89 (eiS 6otu)cia Kai XaXcta&amp;q {3pp;1) is no proper paraphrase of 1 Sam. 12:8 (TiUanEivoosEv). 2) Of the eleven occurrences, excepting the suggested emenda- tion in 10. 3. 2. 42, of OUEXD6c, only two have parallels in the Septuagint: A 6. 9. 1. 173//1 Sam. 17:9; and A 6. 2. 5. 42//1 Sam. 8:17 (6o0Xot). There are no parallels in four cases (A 5. 9. 4. 336; 8. 6. 3. 162; 8. 8. 3. 222; 10. 2. 2. 33). The other five occurrences deal with material other than 1 Samuel-2 Kings. 3) Of the eighteen occurrences of 8bo0Xo in Josephus, three involve a form of 6bou)og replacing some form of raLt6bptov in the Septuagint (A 6. 12. 1. 244-1 Sam. 21:7; A 6. 13. 7. 300-1 Sam. 25:14; A 7. 9. 3. 205-2 Sam. 16:1). Three times Josephus substi- tutes a form of bokXoS for some form of tcal (A 8. 6. 5. 173-1 Kings 10:8; A 8. 11. 2. 276-2 Chron. 13:6; A 8. 14. 1. 38 Eugene C. Ulrich, Jr., The Qumran Text of Samuel and Josephus (Harvard Semitic Monographs, 19) (Missoula, 1978), using the major Samuel Scroll from Qumran, although less than ten percent of it is extant, concludes that this 4QSama is an example of the text tradition that Josephus employed, and that it "fits our description of the proto-Lucianic Greek text" (pp. 257-59). A contrary view, that Josephus u'sed at least two text types, is stated by George Howard, "KAIGE Readings in Josephus," Textus 8 (1973): 45-54. Emanuel Tov, "The Textual Affiliations of 4 Q Sama," Journalfor the Study of the Old Testament 14 (1979): 37-53, concludes that the Dead Sea manuscript of Samuel and the Septuagint version are independent of each other, but that the former is close to the Septuagint and to Josephus' Biblical text. T. Muraoka, "The Greek Text of 2 Samuel 11 in the Lucianic Manuscripts," Abr-Nahrain 20 (1981-82): 37-59, cites at least one case (2 Sam. 11:8) where Josephus is evidently not dependent on the Greek. On Josephus' possible use of a Septuagint "Vorlage" cf. Shaye J. D. Cohen, Josephus in Galilee and Rome: His Vita and Development as a Historian (Leiden, 1979), p. 36, n. 45. 39 The text of the Septuagint used for this comparison was Alfred Rahlfs, ed., Septuaginta, 4th ed. (Stuttgart, 1950). 298</page><page sequence="19">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN 367-1 Kings 21:6). No reasons have been found for these substi- tutions. There are no parallels with the Septuagint in six cases (A 6.9.4. 185; 8.1.5.18; 8.14.1. 369; 8.14.4. 385; 9.6.4. 122; 9. 14. 1. 282). Both Josephus and the Septuagint use a form of 8oikog six times (A 6. 12. 5. 256; 6. 13. 10. 324; 7. 4. 3. 87; 7. 13. 4. 331; 8.7.5. 198; 9. 6. 6. 135). 4) Of the two occurrences of bouoX6o, neither has verbal paral- lels in the Septuagint. Granted that one needs to have a Septuagint text that is as close as possible to the one probably used by Josephus (proto-Lucianic), nonetheless, Josephus' very free paraphrases and additions, as well as omissions, make it difficult to discover any meaningful pattern in his use of 1 Samuel-2 Kings (Septuagint).40 The results thus far are too discouraging to warrant further comparisons, at least not without computer assistance. (d) A fourth method of establishing the meanings of Josephus' terms for slavery is to compile and compare statistical summaries of those terms in the various parts of his writings. Findings of it are presented in the accompanying table, which lists the locations in Josephus' writings of each word. Other Greek words, namely, &amp;ac6Xouog (twenty times in Josephus), 8cc6Eo (fifteen times in W), 6?oCatog (eleven times in A), 7natiov (48 or 51 times, counting alternate readings, in Josephus), and nacttlptov (once), that may have elsewhere designated slaves, do not appear to have been so used by Josephus. Additional words designating slaves elsewhere in Greek literature, namely Kopacstov, kaxTpEc6, natLtoicKaptov, and 5ouXaptov, are not found in Josephus at all. We may note that eotOTzrlc (17 times in W, 17 times also in A), meaning in chains but not usefully put to work, implies not the same as being a slave, and refers to captive prisoners, who may or may not have been treated as slaves. The terms 8taicov?t (W4. 4. 3. 252; 39 times in A), tiaKovia (W 3. 5. 1. 70; 14 times in A), and tcLaKOvog (three times in W, eleven in A) refer to service or ministry of a priest (e.g., A 3. 7. 2. 155), a 40 Cohen (above, n. 38), while describing Josephus' general faithfulness to his sources, nonetheless emphasizes "his inveterate sloppiness" (p. 233), and the fact that he is "not consistent" (p. 37) in his use of the Bible. For a critique of Cohen see Thomas W. Franxman, Genesis and the "Jewish Antiquities" of Flavius Josephus (Rome, 1979), especially p. 289, and Louis H. Feldman, "Josephus' Portrait of Saul," HUCA 53 (1982): especially pp. 98-99. 299</page><page sequence="20">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW servant (nraic: A 13. 11. 3. 314), or anyone else. None of these occurrences refers unambiguously to a slave, except when another word that designates a slave is also used. To serve for hire as a soldier is not the same as to be a slave, but is more like being a bondman for military service. Thus the following words were not found useful for the study of slavery: Itt9o(popq0 o (two or three times in A), Ltt9o(p6poS (nine times in W, ten in A), 1to060w (four times in W, nine in A), and [ito0oz6g (W 1.26. 2. 517). Meanings might be clarified if Josephus had made any consis- tent shifts in vocabulary, if one word was preferred above others or was neglected in one work but not in another, or if slaves had figured more prominently in one place in Josephus' work than in another. It is striking, for example, that slaves are mentioned only six times in the Life: only one of these (L 44. 221) in reference to a domestic of Josephus, one in reference to an accuser against Josephus (L 76. 429), and one in reference to Josephus' first wife, whom the Romans had captured at Caesarea and whom Vespasian commanded Josephus to marry (L 75. 414). Probably slaves are seldom mentioned because most of the Life (7. 28-74. 413) is a highly defensive apologetic for a mere six months of Josephus' life, with the focus on Josephus' activities as a general in Galilee. It is further worthy of note that the only major shift in vocabu- lary occurs in A 15-16, where &amp;avpadnoov, av6paro6ioo, and 0epancov (the latter also not in L and Ap) do not occur. The fact that 0epaiciov, which occurs 23 times in A, Books 1-14, occurs nowhere in 15-19 is striking, especially when we consider that the ratio in the use of the most common word for slave, SouSos, is 41:15 as between these parts of Josephus' work. We may also note that oiKcizrg is more heavily used in A 1-14 than anywhere else. Whether these phenomena could support a theory of separate authorship or of the use of assistants for A 15-19 is an open question, although it does seem to be in line with some other evidence.41 41 We may also note that in the case of the word nap66esyta, more than half (eleven) of the twenty occurrences in the Antiquities are in only two books, namely 17 and 18, precisely the "Thucydidean" books according to Thackeray. Moreover, the word EDcaptoToAv is found twenty-six times in the Antiquities but nowhere in 300</page><page sequence="21">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN The 68oiXo group predominates. This is not surprising in view of Josephus' concentration on political events and military defeats and victories, in which enslavements occurred readily and often. There are 78 additional instances of Ocpandia in all of Josephus' works, and 72 more of 0epanTCE o, but these are not concerned with slavery. Statistical surveys thus do not display any precision in Josephus' use of terms. Perhaps from the lofty perspective of an aristocrat, both a friend to emperors and a member of the priestly order (W3. 8. 3, 352; L 1. 2 and 39. 198; Ap 1. 10. 54), it was of little consequence to him whether anyone was half-slave or full slave, a slave by indebtedness or by capture in war. Nor does one find in Josephus any concentrated discussion of slavery as an institution either within Judaism or within the Roman Empire. To sum up section 1, slaves were so much a part of Josephus' world that he apparently never gave thought to the theory and practice of slavery as an institution. He merely included individual slaves where they belonged naturally in stories of big names and formative events, while chronicling one nation's enslavement after another in the wake of wars.42 Details about the exact status of an individual slave, whether he or she was born slave, bought slave, half-slave, or the like, apparently did not often interest him. We should add, however, that Josephus' lack of interest in the exis- tence of semi-servile statuses between slave and free was charac- teristic of Greek thinkers and writers generally. The passive voice of 6ouieeItv was often used to describe enslavement as a result of military defeat. If one recalls that war, piracy, and the raising of abandoned children were the major sources of slaves in the first century C.E., the frequency in Josephus Books 17-19; on the other hand, its synonym, Xaptv ci6evat, occurs nine times in the Antiquities, although never in 17-19. The distribution of the pronoun 065 seems significant: it occurs 191 times in Josephus-30 times in the seven books of the War, 49 times in the first sixteen books of the Antiquities, never in Book 20 of the Antiquities, once in the Life, four times in Against Apion, and 107 times in Books 17-19 of the Antiquities. In other words, 56% of all occurrences are in these three books. Thus Books 17-19 do seem to be special, whether because Josephus had the help of assistants or because he himself was reading heavily in certain authors, such as Thucydides. 42 Cf. Cohen (above, n. 38), pp. 240-42, for example, who lists themes in W, A, and L. 301</page><page sequence="22">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of this verb, already engraved into literature by Herodotus, is not surprising.43 Strict distinctions between the nouns 5oW0oq, Opanuov, and oiKrTTrl were not maintained, although &amp;avparco6ov does consis- tently designate in Josephus an enslaved war captive, even though in the first instance he is a human being under the aspect of an item of property. Comparisons between Josephus and earlier historians, including the Septuagint of 1 Samuel-2 Kings, yielded no surprises, and showed that Josephus wrote at a time when the process of blurring classical distinctions between terms was well advanced.44 II. METAPHORICAL USES Josephus' attitude toward slavery may be seen better not in the statistics and meanings of terms but in metaphorical uses of the 6oi)os word group, for metaphors capitalize on widely accepted meanings. However, since Josephus applied no other term in the slavery vocabulary to metaphorical use, the 6o0Xog word group may appear to be the one to designate "slave" as distinct from other subservients. (a) First, there is enslavement to passion. Anthony was enslaved by his passion for Cleopatra (6E8ouocsEivov, W 1. 12. 5. 243; also W7. 8. 4. 302). Hebrew youths, seduced by the Midianite women, were enslaved by them (same verb, A 4. 6. 7. 133). Mariamne took advantage of the fact that Herod was enslaved by his passion for her (8ou6k60, A 15. 7. 4. 219). In all three instances the enslavement means not being in charge of oneself but being at the mercy of another person. 43 Concerning war as a source of slaves cf. Arnold H. M. Jones, "Slavery in the Ancient World," reprinted in Moses I. Finley, Slavery in Classical Antiquity (above, n. 3), p. 9. A dramatic example is reported in W 3. 10. 10. 532-42. 44 See E. Kretschmer, "Beitraige zur Wortgeographie der altgriechischen Dia- lekte, 1: Diener, Sklave," Glotta 18 (1929): 67-81; Hugh J. Mason, Greek Terms for Roman Institutions: a Lexicon and Analysis (Toronto, 1974). Comparison with New Testament words for slavery is facilitated by the excellent article by Spicq (above, n. 3), pp. 201-26, who concludes that in the New Testament 8oi5.og means either slave or servant, but that in both cases it emphasizes unconditional obedience; 0epdcuov also means either slave or servant and implies a relation of intimacy and confidence with the master; oIKTrlts means "a domestic," slave or free, usually living in the house of the owner; &amp;vSpano8ov usually means slave. 302</page><page sequence="23">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN (b) Second, there is not only involuntary economic servitude but also its opposite, voluntary slavery to lucre. During famine many Egyptians gave up everything, including their land, to get food. "And thus it befell that the king became owner of all their substance.... Furthermore, this scourge enslaved not only their bodies but also their minds and drove them thereafter to degrading means of subsistence" (?6ouXou, A 2. 7. 7. 191). Cleopatra is accused of doing anything to get money, so that she "was enslaved by her appetites" (8ouE?uo6UtC TaXiS Ent0ouliati, A 15.4. 1.91). Both poor people and beasts have the right to share in the harvest. The landowner who does not respect this right is to be publicly given forty lashes, for though he is a free man (?Xe60Opo0), "through slavery to lucre he has outraged his dignity" (6oukFecat, A 4. 8. 21. 238). We may here note that whipping is a symbolic punishment for those (such as barbarians, slaves, and children) who have no 76yo;; thus Thucydides (5. 50. 4) tells of a Spartan named Lichas son of Arcesilaus who competed at the Olympic games, from which the Spartans had previously been excluded, and consequently received blows from the umpires after his team had won. Since in all these cases one's obsession determines all one's other activities, enslavement is clearly the single dominant determinant of a person's life. (c) Third, military and political subjection produced not only actual slaves but also the metaphorical enslavement of paying tribute or even of living under a forcibly changed form of govern- ment. This is particularly evident in the extended speech which Josephus attributes to Agrippa (W 2. 16. 4. 345-401) and which was clearly delivered to men who were not slaves (cf. A 16. 2. 4. 40). His repetitions are built on the 6o0kog wordgroup (e.g., W 2. 16. 4. 358, 361, 365, 375, 377, 378, 379). It is a long list of nations that have submitted to Rome, and Agrippa unfurls it to dissuade those Jews who as free men were bent on revolt. He means to describe the conditions of subjection much more inclusively than those of individual enslavement, but the language of the worst subjection is applied to both: Passing to your present passion for liberty, I say that it comes too late. The time is past when you ought to have striven never 303</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to lose it. For servitude is a painful experience, and a struggle to avoid it once and for all is just; but the man who having once accepted the yoke then tries to cast it off is a contumacious slave, not a lover of liberty (W 2. 16. 4. 355-356). Consequently, when Josephus urged his fellow countrymen to surrender, he observed the finality of Roman power at that point in history and commented that to serve (68oukctiv), in this case the Romans, would be no new experience (W 5. 9. 3. 364). In the report about the Assyrian victory over the Sodomites Josephus equates serving Assyria (8oukcEovTrc) with paying trib- ute to them (A 1. 9.1. 173). Further, in Samuel's warning against the evils of monarchy he predicts that the people as a whole will be servants (6oukacET8c) to the king "along with all their own domes- tics" (oiKe?atc, A 6. 3. 5. 42). Goliath's retort to Saul and the Hebrews, on the other hand, carries the unmistakably non- metaphorical warning that "to the people of the victor the other side shall be slaves" (8ou)k8E ouci, A 6. 9. 1. 173). Political subjection, moreover, could be accomplished from within a country without military invasion. Hyrcanus and Aristob- ulus were accused of trying to change the Jewish form of govern- ment "in order that they might become a nation of slaves" (6oOkov, A 14. 3. 2. 41). In these instances it is taken for granted that slavery is a painful loss of liberty and implicitly also of dignity, for one is thereby "yoked," as if he were an animal. (d) Fourth, there is a kind of enslavement which we today might call psychological in character. As previously noted, the king of Egypt had during a famine enslaved not only the bodies but also the minds of his subjects (6t6vota, A 2. 7. 7. 191; and cf. Thucydides 2. 61). Further, in a section highly reminiscent of Thucydides, Josephus extols the Hebrews' victory over the Amale- kites: "for they enslaved (E68oUoccav) not only the persons of their assailants but also their spirit" (A 3. 2. 4. 56). A second instance is provided by Clemens, in his agreement with Chaerea's opposition to the Emperor. He objects that he and his friends are "bearing these arms not to preserve the liberty and government of the Romans but to save the life of one who makes them slaves (6oukoubvtVOu) in body and mind" (A 19. 1. 6. 42). A third example occurs in the charge made against Gaius' wife that she was responsible for his misconduct, for "she had given him 304</page><page sequence="25">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN a drug calculated to enslave his thinking and to excite his passion for her" (vvotiv 8o6X0otv: A 19. 2. 4. 193). In these examples it is assumed that slavery is more than anything else a bondage from the inside, from within the core of one's being. (e) Fifth, all the above mentioned types of metaphor (a through d) presuppose decidedly negative assessments of slavery. But there is another kind of metaphor which shows that the essential element is not so much whether or not one is a slave as under what conditions and to what sort of person or power one is enslaved. Accordingly, the slavery metaphor is applied not only to military and political subjection but also to voluntary citizenship. It is notable, on the one hand, that Josephus adds Kai (pikoug to the accounts in 1 Kings 10:8 and 2 Chron. 9:7 about the Queen of Sheba's accolades to and about Solomon: "Fortunate do I hold the Hebrew people to be, and your servants (o6ious;) and friends as well, who daily enjoy the sight of you and continually listen to your wisdom" (A 8. 6. 5. 173). Incidentally, here it would seem that not even 6ou;og means always "slave." Solomon is warned, on the other hand, that God "would deliver the ten Tribes to his servant," meaning Jeroboam (A 8. 7. 5.198), who is also called Solomon's "servant" (8oikoS) by Abijah (A 8. 11. 2. 276). Clearly this description of a leader as a 5oiXoq is a metaphorical use intended to emphasize Jeroboam's duty and commitment as leader, for he had bound himself thereto. This combined pejorative and approbative employment of the slavery metaphor with reference to citizenship makes sense in the light of the fact that it was the nature of the kingdom which, so far as Josephus was concerned, determined whether one was slave or free in it. Accordingly, on the one hand Nicolaus of Damascus tells Agrippa that if the Jews of Ionia were to evaluate the present government in comparison with the early kingdom, of all the things which it has done to make them still happier there is one above all which is enough in itself to achieve this, namely that they no longer are found to be slaves (6o6Dioug) but free men (A 16. 2. 4. 40 = Jacoby, FGrHist IIA, no. 142, p. 427). A second example comes from Chaerea's words to Vinicianus in opposition to Gaius: "I am tormented when I see my country 305</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW reduced from unequaled freedom to slavery (6ouVcactt) and robbed of its excellent laws. Because Gaius lives, the human race is overtaken by disaster" (A 19. 1. 9. 57). On the other hand, Josephus was not appalled at the idea of Jews serving Rome. In fact, when he was commissioned to urge the Jews to surrender, he argued that it was useless to resist, for God is on the side of the Romans (W 5. 9. 3. 367). Many nations have submitted to Rome, argued Agrippa in his effort to dissuade the Jews from war, "and will you alone disdain to serve (6OUEtcItV) those to whom the universe is subject?" (W 2. 16. 4. 361). It is Josephus' opinion that even God Himself, for loathing of their impiety, turned away from our city and, because He deemed the Temple to be no longer a clean dwelling place for Him, brought the Romans upon us and purification by fire upon the city, while He inflicted slavery (6oucPiav) upon us together with our wives and chil- dren; for He wished to chasten us by these calamities (A 20. 8. 5. 166; cf. W4. 5. 2. 323; 5. 1. 3. 19; etc.). Here we see a theological interest in Josephus.45 (f) Sixth, one type of metaphor shows that it was thinkable for slavery to have a really positive evaluation-it all depended on the character of the owner. On five occasions worship and service of 46 God are consequently described with words of the 5oiXoq group.4 These are in addition to three uses (W 1. 7. 4. 148; 1. 7. 5. 150; A 18. 3. 4. 70) of O?pan8ia in reference to worship; but that noun is not used by Josephus in connection with slavery. According to Josephus' retelling of the account in 1 Chronicles (chapters 23-26) of David's dividing priests and Levites into courses, "he also ordained that all those of the Tribe of Levites and the priests should serve (6ouVE6tv) God night and day, as Moses had enjoined them" (A 7. 13. 7. 367). It is noteworthy that Josephus' metaphor is apparently based on the Masoretic text of 45 Cf. Harold W. Attridge, The Interpretation of Biblical History in the Antiqui- tates Judaicae of Flavius Josephus (Chico, California, 1976), p. 181, who maintains that Josephus' writing has a "theologically reflective dimension," and that he "redefined" the significant elements of Jewish history or "creatively adapted" it. For an opposing point of view see Feldman (above, n. 2). 46 Cf. a similar metaphorical usage in the New Testament, as discussed by Russell (above, n. 25), pp. 439-69. 306</page><page sequence="27">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN 1 Chron. 23:28, 32, which thrice repeats the phrase la- abodat bet 'Adonay and is not based on the Septuagint translation Tzo XtTOupyciv ev O'Kl) Kcpiou. Both the Masoretic text and the Septuagint of Ezra 5:11, which is the primary text informing A 11. 4. 4. 90, use the language of slavery ('abdohi and 8oUXot respectively) to describe Zerubbabel and Jeshua as, in Josephus' words, "servants of the Most High God." 1 Esdras 6:27 uses naTL. In the enumeration of the exiles returning to Jerusalem, Jo- sephus lists 392 "Temple servants" (6oUkot icpoi: A 11. 3. 10. 70). Although the Masoretic text of Ezra 2:43, 70 has netinim, and the Septuagint merely transliterates this, 1 Esdras 5:29, 35 has i?p66o)oot.. The building of the Temple is to be left to "the servants of God, the Jews, and their leaders" (A 11. 4. 6. 101), a phrase that Josephus evidently borrowed from 1 Esdras' description in 6:27 of Zerubbabel as Tov naIta Kupiou; but observe the change in A 11. 4. 6. 101 to 6oU6ot;. Four of Josephus' metaphorical uses of 6oukos words in appli- cation to the worship of God are therefore clearly mandated by his sources. This metaphor, which emphasizes God's election of his servants,47 builds on the well-known fact that the slave is chosen by his owner. The only other use by Josephus serves his attack against pagan religion. The direct opposite of man's service to God is what Josephus, in his latest work, charges against the Greeks' religion. After complaining that "even the eldest of the gods ... could not restrain his passion for his consort long enough to permit of withdrawal to his chamber," Josephus acidly comments: Then there are the gods in bondage (6O0uU60ovTCC) to men, hired now as builders, now as shepherds; and others chained, like criminals, in a prison of brass.48 What man in his senses would 47 Sass (above, n. 22), pp. 24-32, maintains this against Rengstorf (above, n. 7), p. 270. What makes the person a servant, as Sass points out, is not his obedience or faithfulness but the fact that God elects him to accomplish His work through him. Cf. W 3. 8. 3. 254: God chose Josephus (?EI:4O)). 48 Josephus is here perhaps alluding to Heracles' service as a slave to Omphale, queen of the Lydians (Sophocles, Trachiniae, 68-72, 248-54, 274-76) or to Apollo's service to Admetus (Hyginus, Fabulae 50; Apollodorus 3. 10. 4). 307</page><page sequence="28">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW not be stirred to reprimand the inventors of such fables and to condemn the consummate folly of those who believed them? (Ap 2. 34. 247). (g) A concluding observation: it is notable that even though Josephus, on the basis of practical necessity, accepted Jewish subordination to Rome, he bridled against his people ever being enslaved to a foreign power. Since Josephus was a priest, one might wonder whether this was because he considered it defiling for a Jew to be a slave to a pagan.49 In high dudgeon against Herod's law that housebreakers must be sold into slavery and deported, for instance, Josephus retorted that "this was not the act of a king but of a tyrant," for to be enslaved "to those who did not have the same manner of life [as the Jews] . . was an offense against religion" (A 16. 1. 1. 2). There is also the view of tradition, as reported in A 4. 8. 15. 219, that slaves (8oi6ot) should not be accepted as legal witnesses "because of the baseness of their soul, since whether from cupidity or fear it is likely that they will not attest the truth." Further, "female slaves (bou6aq) must not be taken in marriage by free men" (A 4. 8. 23. 244), nor by priests (A 3. 12. 2. 276), on the assumption that they have probably been defiled. On the other hand, in Josephus' embellishment of the account in 1 Chronicles 28, King David says, "For it is not such a terrible thing to serve (6ouX6tciv) even a foreign master, if God so wills" (A 7. 14. 9. 373). It is only God's willing it that makes enslavement of His people acceptable as a kind of chastisement (cf. sections c and e of Part II above). However, since Josephus could hardly have lived so long in Rome as a well-adjusted citizen had he been so concerned about the defilement of life among the pagans, one looks for a more likely 49 We are indebted to Prof. John Helgeland of North Dakota State University for raising this question. Concerning defilement or pollution, Mary Douglas, in International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (David L. Sills, ed.; New York, 1968) 12:341, has shown that "dirt implies system and that pollution beliefs indicate the areas of great systematization." The question is, then, what system or structure of thought produced Josephus' revulsion against Jews being enslaved by others. Perhaps the answer lies in the statement that the Jews regard themselves as servants of God alone. It is in this light that the view of the Fourth Philosophy, that God alone was their leader and master (6&amp;on6OTv, master of slaves) (A 18. 1. 6. 23), is to be understood. 308</page><page sequence="29">JOSEPHUS' VOCABULARY-GIBBS and FELDMAN explanation of his revulsion against enslavement of the Jewish people. Probably it is a matter of national honor, a frequent theme in his writings, and one which could be understood by his Roman readers. For instance, in the wilderness the issue, as Moses saw it, was whether "ye have the spirit to endure for its [i.e., liberty's ( XeV0upiav)] sake both deprivation of food and lack of water, or prefer slavery, like the beasts which slave for the masters who feed them" (A 3. 1. 4. 20). Again, Josephus polemicizes against Apion's ignoring the fact that "the Egyptians were slaves (e8o6i8EU ov) and veritable menials, first of the Persians, and then of the Mace- donians, the next rulers of Asia; while we were not merely inde- pendent but had dominion over the surrounding states" (Ap 2. 11. 133-134). Subsequently, while Solomon was king "of the Hebrews no one was a slave (o6?tucEV). . . but they all bore arms and served in the field on chariots and horses rather than lead the lives of slaves" (68oVDcovT?) (A 8. 6. 3. 161). At Masada, when all appeared to be lost, Eleazar, who to be sure was the leader of the Sicarii, whom Josephus despised so much, urged suicide: "Long since, my brave men, we determined to serve (6OUXE)itV) neither the Romans nor any other save God, for He alone is man's true and righteous Lord" (W 7. 8. 6. 323).50 Earlier the Jewish leaders, with whom Josephus, of course, dis- agrees, had retorted to Titus "that they scorned death, which they honorably preferred to slavery" (6okoXiaS) (W 5. 11. 2. 458). Under the twin onslaughts of Roman siege and famine one poor woman allegedly "proceeded to an act of outrage upon nature" when she killed, cooked, and ate half her infant son rather than let him live for slavery (6ouki?a) under the Romans (W 6. 3. 4. 205-206). While Josephus was too pragmatic to yield to his companions' ideological opposition to Rome ("Is life so dear to you, Josephus, that you can endure to see the light in slavery (8oikog)?" (W 3. 8. 4. 357), he had found in the theme of national honor as contrasted to slavery an effective contact point with Roman sentiments.

Iud. VII 341 sqq.)," Rheinisches Museum 75 (1926): 106-14; and Otto Bauernfeind and Otto Michel, "Die beiden Eleazarreden in Jos.

This is not yet the post-Renaissance view of human rights, nor is it a theological assessment of man's nature; but perchance a small seed of Western humanism lies buried in Josephus' incidental references to slaves. To continue further would be to move beyond Josephus' slavery vocabulary and metaphorical uses of it to motifs of his views of slavery, but that is the subject of another article.</page></plain_text>
