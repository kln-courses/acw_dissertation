ISBN 9971692716. Reviewed by Laura Lee Junker, University of Illinois Chicago This edited volume on the earthenware pottery studies by prominent scholars working throughout Southeast Asia is a very welcome addition to the Southeast Asian archaeological literature, with John Miksic bringing together for the first time work by a broad range of archaeologists working in the Philippines, Indonesia, Ma- laysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Assam. I believe there would be litde disagreement between archae- ologists working in Southeast Asia about Miksic's clearly stated rationale for publish- ing this 22-chapter compendium of work on Southeast Asian earthenware pottery. Comparing Southeast Asia to other major cultural regions of the world, where re- gional scholars have collaborated more on developing comparative chronologies and shared interpretive frameworks for their earthenware ceramics, Miksic rightly notes that there has been relatively limited com- munication between archaeologists work- ing with earthenware remains in Southeast Asia. Miksic sees the limited dissemination of earthenware pottery studies through publication, conferences, and other forms of international collaboration as a formida- ble obstacle to making substantial gains in comparative studies between regions, not only in terms of pottery-based regional chronological frameworks, but also in terms of more contextual issues such as how pot- tery production is organized and techno- logically implemented; what ceramics can tell us about the migration of human groups, trade interactions, and the dissemi- nation of widespread symbolic systems Asian Perspectives, Vol. 46, No. 1 © 2007 by the University of Hawai'i Press.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 243 (whether through actual colonization, so- cially or politically charged exchange inter- actions, or emulative production); how pottery reflects aspects of social and polit- ical relations (e.g., gender relations, kin groups, social ranking, factional competi- tion, political alliance); and the cultural meanings of pottery in various past societies (e.g., why are anthropomorphic burial jars found at Ayub Cave in the Philippines? Why are certain earthenware forms used in burial, feasting, and other ritual contexts?). In his introduction, Miksic identifies what I also view as key factors that have impacted the publication and dissemination of an empirical database on Southeast Asian earthenware. First, he notes the difficulty of finding publishing venues, specifically aca- demic or more popular presses that will publish well-illustrated (but often expen- sive) books that are really specific and em- phasize basic data on sites or artifactual categories, since many presses see these kinds of books as having low marketability and potential for profit. Secondly, he emphasizes the fact that earthenware studies are often eclipsed by archaeological investigations of what are considered more "spectacular" finds in Southeast Asia, such as monumental architecture, foreign porce- lains or beads, Buddhist or Hindu religious statuary, and inscriptions. This primacy given to architectural studies and emphasis on ceramics associated with "royal" or "elite" areas of sites rather than nonelite households is also underlined in a paper by Mundardjito, Pojoh, and Ramelan on Java- nese ceramics (chapter 9) and a paper by Miriam Stark on Cambodian earthenware (chapter 15). I would add to this list of fac- tors limiting comparative work on earthen- ware in Southeast Asia the fact that the university tenure process in many countries emphasizes the publication of cutting-edge theoretical work rather than more empiri- cally oriented aspects of research, and therefore professors and beginning scholars are discouraged from publishing "basic data" and "site reports" in favor of these more academically splashy theoretical papers and books in the first decade of their professional career in academics. I can very well relate to Miksic's refreshingly honest reflections on his regret that his dissertation and many early works on ceramics were not published and hence unavailable to many scholars, since I too, now "safely" tenured and in the "mid" part of my career, am feeling the same regret about unpub- lished empirical work and reprioritizing publication plans to include more detailed descriptive writings on excavation, archae- ological survey, and artifact analysis. I should note that linguistic barriers to com- munication between scholars working in the arena of Southeast Asian archaeology are formidable, since we as a group may be one of the most linguistically diverse aca- demic communities working in a "cultural region." Furthermore, in his introduction, Miksic emphasizes the importance of ex- panding scholarly interactions with South Asian, East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), and Oceania (particularly Lapita) specialists, given the several millennia of maritime trade interactions with these other regions, making linguistic and na- tionalistic barriers to shared scholarship even more formidable. Miksic also urges archaeologists to work closely with ethno- graphers and/or to carry out their own eth- noarchaeological research as a means of gaining a richer understanding of the vary- ing cultural milieus and historical contexts of pottery production and use. Miksic's frank discussion of these issues should stim- ulate all archaeologists working in the area to find ways to be inclusive and proactive in getting beyond language barriers to fruitful collaboration with scholars with similar research interests, to assist younger scholars in finding publication venues for both "site reports" and "theoretical" works (and to see the value of both types of pub- lications), and to not relegate earthenware ceramics to ubiquitous "background noise" at archaeological sites, recognizing their significant value in developing interpretive frameworks for cultural practice in the past. Miksic has assembled a truly international range of scholars in this volume, mostly from Southeast Asian institutions, but some from Europe, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Geographically, the</page><page sequence="3">244 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES • 46(1) • SPRING 2OO7 papers cover many of the islands of the Philippines and Indonesia, Malaysia, Myan- mar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, with an interesting paper from the western edge of this regional distribution (Assam) and with significant comparisons to south- ern China earthenware in many papers. The time range is equally broad, ranging from Early Neolithic sites to historic period sites, with some studies including ethno- graphic work with contemporary potters in regions of archaeological interest. Some papers focus more narrowly on certain time periods, a particular site or small re- search region, a particular methodological approach to pottery analysis, and/or a highly specific research problem such as trade routes or production techniques, while other papers provide a synthesis of earthenware pottery finds and analyses for the whole time range of pottery making in certain areas of the region, with an em- phasis on addressing larger-scale and more generalized issues of pottery chronology and distribution. In addition to Miksic's in- troductory chapter, two following chapters by Wilhelm Solheim present a more regionwide synthesis of issues related to earthenware analysis; the remainder of the book is largely organized according to modern nationalistic boundaries. Miksic recognizes that this may not be the most ideal structure for encouraging noninsular- ity among archaeologists of different nations and for emphasizing shared research issues rather than regional foci, but the many sig- nificant cross-cutting research themes and approaches do tend to come through de- spite this choice of ordering the chapters (and the fact that many papers are rich in shared themes and insights with a broad range of other papers might have made any organization by topic very difficult). In this review, however, after commenting on Solheim's introductory chapters, I will at- tempt to briefly review the numerous and diverse additional papers by grouping them by shared themes and approaches rather than in chapter order. Recognizing that Wilhelm Solheim is in many ways the most important progenitor of half a century of earthenware pottery re- search in Southeast Asia, Miksic follows his introduction with two chapters written by Solheim and synthesizing his views on the history of earthenware pottery and its study in the region. In a chapter entitled "South- east Asian Earthenware Pottery and Its Spread," Solheim presents a broad regional synthesis of major discoveries and studies of earthenware pottery from the Neolithic period through what is loosely known as the Metal Age in Southeast Asia, with a lot of good illustrations of decorated wares from various areas of the region that are often grouped to demonstrate his ideas about cultural connections and human migrations in different periods (particularly the connection between the Lapita phe- nomena, Sa-Huynh-Kalanay pottery, and the earlier Neolithic expansion of Malay o- Polynesian speakers in Southeast Asia). He also provides a very useful summary of some of his evolving ideas about the mean- ing of similarities and differences in earth- enware in terms of regional chronologies and population movements, particularly clarifying his notion of pottery "traditions" and distancing himself from earlier inter- pretations that saw him as advocating a sin- gle wave of cultural migration through the region (his model of a Nusantao Maritime Network now emphasizes almost contin- uous movement by many related maritime peoples). In addition, Solheim recognizes the problems of relying too heavily on largely nonsecurely dated decorated sherds in hypothesizing cultural connections, since archaeologists such as Stephen Chia work- ing in Sabah (chapter 13 in the volume) have started to get 14C dates showing the same decorative elements at widely differ- ing time periods. Perhaps the most signifi- cant and controversial aspect of Solheim's discussion in chapter 1 is his hypothesis, based on earthenware similarities, that Southeast Asian maritime peoples may have been responsible for the influx of new pottery designs associated with the Valdivia ceramic complex of 3000-1000 b.c. of coastal Ecuador, an idea that is certain to renew long-term debate over possible early Asia-America contacts. Solheim's second chapter (chapter 2) is</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 245 an insightful and personalized history of how and why he became interested in earthenware pottery research. In this chap- ter, Solheim emphasizes his view that ce- ramic studies aimed at cultural historical re- construction (i.e., local chronologies and then regional syntheses interpreting cul- tural "connections") should be given pri- macy in Southeast Asian archaeology, arguing that an understanding of cultural heritage (specifically, when and from where one's ancestors came) is of prime concern to people of the region who are the ultimate "consumers" of archaeology in museums and public institutions. I don't completely agree with this view, as well as the often-stated idea among some scholars that more recent trends in archaeological theory (e.g., various forms of "processual" or "postprocessual" archaeology) implicitly reject or devalue the use of ceramics for cultural chronologies (or what we might call "culture history"). I believe that archaeologists working in Southeast Asia can simultaneously use ceramics to con- struct solid regional sequences and a com- parative database for making chronological correlations between sites and between regions, while at the same time using other techniques and approaches to ceramic ana- lysis to get at contextual questions that would also be of equal interest to both Southeast Asians in general and other archaeologists. Both local peoples and scholars interested in cultural heritage would be very interested to know that cer- tain "fancy" pedestaled earthenware might have been used for ritual pig feasts several millennia ago in Thailand or that male warriors were habitually buried with cer- tain decorated wares as possible symbols (along with other objects) of warrior pres- tige 600 years ago in the Philippines, imbu- ing the observed patterns of ceramics with cultural meaning and practice within a his- torical context. The papers in this issue well illustrate that Southeast Asian archae- ologists have begun to successfully attack a multiplicity of research questions with the abundant earthenware ceramics found at most Neolithic and later sites by docu- menting ceramic variation in a variety of ways (e.g., microstylistic analysis, various materials analysis techniques such as pétro- graphie analysis and scanning electron microscope, statistical studies of regional spatial distributions), guided by diverse the- oretical paradigms (including what are often broadly labeled as culture history, cultural evolutionary, or postprocessual approaches). A number of the chapters in the volume present regional syntheses of both pub- lished and unpublished work on earthen- ware of a specific period or periods, adding substantially to the reference base of South- east Asian ceramic specialists by making previously inaccessible work available to a broad range of scholars. Most notable are Wilfredo Ronquillo's chapter on early prehistoric pottery from the Philippines (chapter 3), Santoso Soegondho's chapter reviewing the chronologies and cultural contexts of earthenware in 6000-1500 b.p. Indonesia (chapter 6), Kyle Latinis and Ken Stark's chapter synthesizing earthenware researches on Maluku (chapter 8), E. E. McKinnon's detailed presentation of the historic period earthenware from Sumatra (chapter 11), Miriam Stark's summary of earthenware sequences in Cambodia that have long been overshadowed by the more well-known monumental architecture of the Angkor state (chapter 15), Brian Vin- cent's survey of ceramic sequences in northern and central Thailand (chapter 16), Amara Srisuchat's presentation of earthen- ware discoveries at sites in southern Thai- land spanning the prehistoric and historic periods (chapter 17), Ruth Prior and Ian Glover's review of recent work on earthen- ware in transitional prehistoric-historic peri- ods in Vietnam (chapter 18), and MyoThant Tyn and U Thaw Kaung's summary of re- cent research on earthenware at Buddhist sites and other early historic contexts in Myanmar (chapter 19). While many of these chapters also make very significant contributions to our understanding of the changing social and cultural contexts of pottery manufacture and use in their re- gions (see below), they certainly meet Solheim's call for the type of comparative analysis of form and style necessary to begin to construct regional chronologies and a</page><page sequence="5">246 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES • 46(1) • SPRING 2OO7 framework for regional "culture history." Miksic, the authors, and Singapore Univer- sity Press are also to be commended in their inclusion of numerous excellent drawings and photographs of earthenware in the various chapters, allowing this book to function as a true "reference" work in the laboratories of Southeast Asian archae- ologists working with earthenware cer- amics. I should also note that most of the maps of different regions of Southeast Asia and relevant archaeological sites in the vol- ume chapters were produced in a uniform format, with the same fonts, map symbols, and conventions, which facilitates compari- sons of site locations within the region. A good number of the chapters - particularly those focused on specific re- search problems in more narrow time peri- ods and geographic areas - address the long-term and always significant issue of maritime trade and forms of social interac- tion in Southeast Asia, as reflected in earth- enware ceramics. While I cannot mention all of the interesting work on theoretical issues by scholars included in this volume, I provide a few examples aimed at "whetting the reader's appetite" for looking at all of the book's chapters. Elisabeth Bacus (chap- ter 4) presents an interesting statistical anal- ysis of decorative elements on earthenware from geographically widespread sites in the Philippines to demonstrate how ethnohis- torically referenced elite alliance networks and shared emblems of status in the historic period can be documented in the archaeo- logical record. Two chapters, one by Hilda Soemantri analyzing the clay figurines at Majapahit (chapter 10) and another by Eusebio Dizon presenting anthropomor- phic burial jars from the Ayub Cave site in the southern Philippines (chapter 5), leav- ing the more popular research realm of interaction and exchange, illustrate how detailed analysis of excavation contexts and pottery forms can provide important insights about how societies symbolically encoded ideas about the social and political order in ceramics. Another chapter com- paring tripod pottery from Thailand and Malaysia Neolithic and later sites, authored by Leong Sau (chapter 12), considers the social significance of ritual feasting in pre- historic societies of the region (also a focus of Latinis and Stark's interpretation of Mal- uku pottery stoves in chapter 8). However, both Santoso Soegondho (chapter 6) and Mundardjito and colleagues (chapter 9) point out that we may be seeing only limited contexts for social and political action in early Southeast Asian societies, since most archaeological work with cer- amics is still from burial sites and other "ceremonial" contexts or from "elite"- associated architecture. They echo the concerns of Miksic, Stark, and others that archaeologists need to turn their attention more to gaining an understanding of earth- enware production and use in a household context. Several of the chapters, in addressing theoretical questions such as long-term pat- terns of population interaction, production, and exchange in the region, show the ef- fectiveness of innovative methodologies that have not been widely used in South- east Asia but that can add new forms of empirical data to debate on these issues. For example, a chapter by David Bulbeck and Genevieve Clune (chapter 7) bril- liantly demonstrates how microseriation of chronologically diagnostic porcelain and stoneware at Macassar historic period sites, cross-dated in stratigraphically secure con- texts with earthenware, can provide aston- ishingly fine chronologies of decorated earthenware, allowing them to assign dates to surface materials in the region and to wider maritime trade patterns extending into other parts of the Indonesian and Phil- ippine archipelagoes. Several authors (most notably Miksic, Solheim, Latinis and Stark, and Vincent) emphasize the importance of implementing various materials analysis procedures to determine earthenware chemical compositions and sourcing if Southeast Asian archaeologists are to move beyond speculative scenarios of migration and exchange and to sort out whether the distribution of certain earthenware types represent the actual migration of people, interregional or intraregional trade, or the cultural borrowing of design elements by peoples in contact (as aptly stated in</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 247 McKinnon's chapter on Sumatra, we need also be aware that some of our earthenware sherds may come from as far afield as Persia and India!). In their chapter, Bulbeck and Clune point out that maritime specialist groups like the Bajau are historically sig- nificant in disseminating pottery and ideas about pottery forms throughout the region, and that we need material studies to iden- tify some of these previously poorly con- sidered forms of cultural transmission. San- ioso Soegondho's presentation of chemical analyses of various Indonesian earthenware (chapter 6), Nik Hassan Rahman and Asyaari bin Muhamad's x-ray diffraction studies of protohistoric earthenware from Kuala Selinsing in Malaysia (chapter 14), Stephen Chia's (chapter 13) use of multiple materials characterization techniques on Sabah ceramics, and Brian Vincent's (chapter 16) synthesis of various forms of materials analysis on prehistoric Thai cer- amics represent very significant steps in the direction of resolving these issues of earth- enware sourcing and the possible social mechanisms underlying their geographic distribution. Complementing this work tracing earthenware origins is exciting new research at earthenware production sites, as exemplified by Stephen Chia's matching of chemically analyzed clays at a probable production locale with his excavated pot- tery at Sabah sites and Amara Srisuchat's (chapter 17) excavation of a probable kiln site in southern Thailand, where a finely made "ceremonial" ware widely circulated in Thailand, Java, Sumatra, and Singapore may have originated. Finally, I should note that the volume includes three very ex- cellent ethnographic chapters on contem- porary pottery production in Myanmar (Charlotte Reith, chapter 21), the larger region of mainland Southeast Asia (Leedom Lefforts and Louise Cort, chapter 20), and Assam (Dilip Medhi, chapter 22) that heed Miksic's and Solheim's call for more col- laboration between archaeologists and eth- nographers interested in the social and his- torical contexts of earthenware production in the region. In summary, this is a superb book that is likely to become a valued reference work for any archaeologist working with earth- enware ceramics in Southeast Asia, as well as those who desire a well-crafted synthesis of current theoretical interpretations and methodological developments in Southeast Asian archaeology by prominent scholars carrying out research in all the major geo- graphic areas of Southeast Asia. As an endnote, I wanted to point particularly to Eusebio Dizon's chapter discussing the hazards of preserving the anthropomorphic burial jars at Ayub Cave in the Philippines to underscore the point that sites with earthenware as the primary archaeological remains can be in as much danger of de- struction as those with substantial monu- mental architecture and traditionally more "commercially valuable" porcelain. There- fore, we need to continue a strong pace of professionally excavating, preserving, anal- yzing, and publishing these significant ar- chaeological materials.
