<plain_text><page sequence="1">Freud and Dali: Personal Moments 337 Sigmund Freud and Salvador Dali: Personal Moments On 19 July 1938, in a pleasant, suburban house north of central London, an improbable event occurred: the meeting of Sigmund Freud and Salvador Dali. For the re cently exiled founder of psychoanalysis, it was probably little more than an interesting meeting. For the artist, it was the culmination of years of planning and dreaming—an en counter brimming with emotional overtones. Freud casually mentioned the visit in a few brief letters; Dali memorialized the event in his autobiography and drew four portraits of Freud in an attempt to convey his deep feelings about the man who he felt had profoundly affected his life and work.1 Dali embellished his one-sided relationship with Freud with intense feelings and overinvested fantasies. A glance at Dali's past and the pictures he drew after meeting Freud may shed some light on the significance which Freud held for Dali. Salvador Dali was born in 1904, in Figueras, Spain. Three years before Dali's birth, a gifted and beloved brother had died of meningitis at the age of seven. The new child was to serve as more than consolation: he was treated as a replacement and, at times, almost as a reincarnation of the dead boy. He was called by the same name: Salvador— "savior" in Spanish—and was later told that he resembled "the living portrait" of his brother. From childhood on, Dali had to compete with this memory. His behavior was frequently exhibitionistic, rebel lious, and eccentric in an effort to appear unique. His prof fered explanation was: "I wish to prove to myself that I am not the dead brother but the living one." Dali saw his life as a parallel to the myth of Castor and Pollux. One brother, Castor, the child of mortals, was there American Imago, Winter 1983, Vol. 40, No. 4, pp. 337—347.

His half-brother, Pollux, fathered by Zeus, was immortal. When Castor was killed, Pollux shared his immortality with him. Dali noted: "As in the myth of Castor and Pollux, in killing my brother, I have gained immortality for myself."2 Young Dali found himself in a difficult dilemma. He was expected to assume the attributes of another. Since he could not do this, he must surely disappoint his parents and invite their rejection. If, on the other hand, he was recog nized for his own accomplishments, the lustre of the mem ory of the brother would dim. This would cause his parents pain and provide them with justification for turning away from him. Dali's childish sensibilities must certainly have been dis turbed by a disquieting jealously of the brother he had never known. Dali relates an incident when, at the age of five, he pushed a playmate off a bridge onto some rocks fifteen feet below. He claimed to feel no conscious guilt for this malicious deed.3 Examination of the relationship between Dali and his father suggests some reasons for his pursuit of Freud and the rejection it provoked. The father, Don Salvador, was a respected notary of his province who maintained an aura of sophistication about his person and his household. He loved music and appre ciated painting. His house was often the scene for gather ings of the cultural leaders of the town.4 The dignified father patiently indulged his eccentric and talented son despite his infantile tyranny. Dali remem bered: "Nothing was good enough for me. I was allowed to do anything I pleased. I wet my bed for the sheer fun of it till I was eight. I was the absolute monarch of the house. My father ... worshipped me."5 Indeed, his father appeared to be quite proud of him and kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings pertaining to Dali's accomplishments.4'6 Yet, no matter how indulgent, how apparently accept ing and encouraging his father might have been, the dead brother's spectre was omnipresent. As noted, Dali's antics were attempts to attract his father's attention at any cost. He viciously kicked his small sister,7 and irritated his father by</page><page sequence="3">Freud and Dali: Personal Moments 339 doing everything possible to obstruct his admission to the School of Fine Arts in Madrid8 from which he was expelled several years later.9 He was to enact a similar pattern in his relationship to Sigmund Freud. A drawing done in 1925 portrays Dali's father as stern. The expression in the eyes is haughty. The father is de picted as big, indeed corpulent, with a pendulous double chin. (Figure 1) Dali referred to his father as "Moses, William Tell, Ju piter." He painted his portrait in oils and said: "As his por trait had to weigh more than all of the others, I deliberately weighted it with the maximum number of layers of paint." His father took on the powerful glow of the sun itself.10 Dali began his idealized relationship with Freud and psychoanalysis at the age of twenty-one, while a student at the School of Fine Arts.11 He read the Interpretation of Dreams, one of the "capital discoveries" of his life. He attrib uted to it his interest in self-interpretation, not only of dreams but of his personal experiences.12 Dali frequently referred to Freud's important influence on him. Once, in rebuttal to an accusation that he was anti Semitic, Dali wrote: "The two personalities whom I esteem the most and who influence my life ... [are] Jewish: Freud and Einstein."13 (Figure 2) One of his early collectors com mented that Dali spoke of Freud as a Christian would of the apostles.14 Many of Dali's paintings, such as City of Drawers (1936) and Anthropomorphic Cabinet (1936), were either dedicated to Freud or conceived with "Freudian principles" as their genesis. Dali longed to meed Freud and set about in pursuit of him. He tried, on three occasions, to present himself to Freud in Vienna. He characterized these unsuccessful at tempts as "three drops of water which lacked the reflection</page><page sequence="4">340 Sharon Romm and Joseph Wm. Slap Fig. 1.

On each of these trips, he invariably learned that Freud was "out of town for reasons of health." His attempted contacts never materialized and Dali in dulged himself in imaginary conversations with Freud. "He even came home with me once," he fantasized, "and stayed all night clinging to the curtains of my room at the Hotel Sacher."15 Dali's feelings about Freud can be seen in the four Freud-portraits of 1937 and 1938. The first (Figure 3), sketched from a newspaper photograph10 (Figure 4), treats his subject more as a statue than a living person. Freud appears so remote that the drawing is quite static, almost inanimate. Of the second picture, conceived if not executed during the second week of June, 1938, Dali wrote: Several years after my last ineffectual attempt to meet Freud, I made a gastronomic excursion into the region of Sens in France. We started dinner with snails, one of my favorite dishes ... All of a sudden I saw a photo graph of Professor Freud on the front page of a news paper . . . [Figure 4]. I . . . read that the exiled Freud had just arrived in Paris. We had not yet recovered from the effect of this news when I uttered a loud cry. I had just that instant discovered the morphological secret of Freud. Freud's cranium is a snail. His brain is in the form of a spiral—to be extracted with a needle.15 The portrait inspired by this association (Figure 5) shows Freud in several views, with the skull resembling a convoluted snail shell. The face bears an expression of anger. Interpreting this drawing as a dream or daydream, it should be noted that Dali was reading about Freud and eating his favorite snails when he conceived the picture. If Freud's skull was a snail shell, then Dali was eating Freud's brains. This was the part of Freud which he admired most and which he wished to incorporate. At the same time, the portrait can be seen as a hostile gesture. Dali is angry at Freud for his previous rejections and projects that anger onto the face of Freud in the picture. Furthermore, the snail, an inconsiderable creature tucked into its protective</page><page sequence="8">344 Sharon Romm and Joseph Wm. Slap shell, is perceived as insignificant for not having emerged from his shell to pay homage to Dali. The long-awaited encounter took place on July 1, 1938. This meeting was arranged by Stefan Zweig, friend and correspondent of Freud. Zweig, even though he was con cerned with the fragile state of Freud's health, wrote Freud three times asking him to meet with Dali, whom he con sidered "the only painter of genius in our epoch."17 Zweig proposed to include Dali's wife and the poet, Edward James, in the caravan which would visit Freud. . . . To reinforce their legitimacy, the visitors planned to carry with them, for Freud's pleasure and edification, a painting of Dali's called "Narcissus." Such a display, they supposed, would justify their visit. They also wanted to bring a gramo phone record of a Dali poem to be read while "Narcissus" was on display. This could not be done due to the inconve nience of hauling the equipment. On his way to the meeting, Dali claimed to have seen a strange combination of objects. While crossing Freud's yard, Dali claimed that he saw a bicycle leaning against a wall. On the saddle, attached by a string, was a red rubber hot-water bottle, and across the bottle crawled a snail. The painter described the meeting with Freud in these words: Contrary to my hopes we spoke little, but we de voured each other with our eyes .. . suddenly I had the whim of trying to appear in his eyes as a kind of dandy of 'universal intellectualism.' I learned later that the effect I produced was exactly the opposite. Before leaving I wanted to give him a magazine con taining an article I had written on paraonia.* I there ♦(Probably "Nouvelles considérations générales sur le mécanisme du phéno mène paranoïaque du point de vue surrealiste." Minotaure, No. 1, Paris, May 1933.)</page><page sequence="9">Freud and Dali: Personal Moments 345 fore opened the magazine at the page of text, begging him to read it. .. Freud continued to stare at me with out paying the slightest attention to my magazine. Try ing to interest him, I explained that it was not a Sur realist diversion, but... an ambitiously scientific article, and I repeated the title, pointing to it with my finger. Before his imperturbable indifference my voice became sharper and more insistent. Then, continuing to stare at me with a fixity in which his whole being seemed to converge, Freud exclaimed, addressing Stefan Zweig, 'I have never seen a more complete example of a Span iard. What a fanatic!'19 Dali sketched Freud during this visit and signed the portrait (Figure 6). In the picture, the psychoanalyst is in a pose of attentive listening, his chin propped on his hand. His eyes have limitless depth, his age and intensity are revealed. Dali himself says of the picture:20 "This portrait was drawn to catch the circumstantial Freud of our inter view. In this drawing I had unconsciously prefigured his approaching death." It is true that Zweig, who also felt that Dali had shown clairvoyance, dared not show the pic ture to Freud.18 The eyes depicted in this portrait convey a feeling of distance; the expression seems inscrutable, reflecting Dali's perception of Freud's elusiveness. Dali emphasized that Freud's death was "unconsciously predicted." Yet the state ment seems to be made quite consciously. Perhaps Dali's anger at Freud's indifference is expressed by his wish to see him dead. If so, by use of the term "unconscious" he may have addressed his sense of guilt for this murderous wish. Dali had brought his valuable possessions for Freud to admire but received a disappointing response. In fact, Freud hardly acknowledged his presence, speaking about him to Zweig as if he were not present. Freud's reaction to Dali is recorded in a letter he sent to Zweig on the day following the meeting. While a write-off of the Surrealists in general, the letter acknowledged Dali's skill.</page><page sequence="10">346 Sharon Romm and Joseph Wm. Slap Lieber Herr Doktor, I really owe you thanks for bringing yesterday's visi tor. For until now I have been inclined to regard the surrealists who have apparently adopted me as their patron saint, as complete fools (let us say 95%, as with alcohol). That young Spaniard, with his candid, fanati cal eyes and his undeniable technical mastery, has changed my estimate. It would be very interesting to investigate analytically how he came to create that . 1Q picture. There were some similarities between Freud and Dali's father. Both were seen as elusive by Dali. No matter how talented he might be, Dali may well have felt he could never replace his dead brother and be accepted by his father in his own right. Similarly, Freud may have seemed inaccessi ble to Dali in part because he was not interested in and could not be seduced by Dali's antics. Both were men of distinction: Dali's father was a cultural leader of his town and Freud was a world-famous scientist. Both men used writing as an integral part of their profession: Dali's father was a notary and Freud the author of books. Both men, viewed by Dali as godlike, possessed power to give Dali per mission for his self-display: the father treated Dali like a royal baby who could do no wrong. No embarrassing or outrageous caper of Dali's could dissuade the father from cherishing him, as shown in his scrapbook of treasured memories. Freud, unwittingly, may have been perceived by Dali as granting permission for misbehavior as well. After reading the Interpretation of Dreams, Dali may well have seen a personal message in that he now had permission to dis play his unconscious for all to see. Dali made a fourth and final drawing of Freud (Figure 7). The anger on Freud's face is not disguised. Dali perhaps felt no need to hide his rage at Freud's rejection, and pro jects his own feelings onto the dying Freud. In view of his childhood traumata, and the inordinate intensity and grandiosity of his repetitive demands, the re jection which Dali met was probably inevitable. He could never be the "real" Salvador, the small boy who had the</page><page sequence="11">Freud and Dali: Personal Moments 347 misfortune to die prematurely and leave a legacy of perfec tion behind.
