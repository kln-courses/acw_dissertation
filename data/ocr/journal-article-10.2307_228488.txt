<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Early Animal Behaviorists: Prolegomenon to Ethology By Philip Howard Gray* INTRODUCTION THAT ZOOLOGISTS pioneered the observational study of animal behavior while psychologists developed the laboratory approach is a generally held assumption which I have found impossible to verify. Even as late as the end of the nineteenth century the academic psychologists were interested in animals chiefly to the extent that they exhibited a precursor of the normal adult human mind.1 The eventual adoption of animal behavior as a scientific area of investigation in psychology is traceable to the fact that students of prominent men began to use animals as subjects for dissertation research.2 The academic zoologists of the same period were just as slow to make animal behavior an academic discipline, and when they did integrate ethology they did so partially on the excuse that behavior could be used as a taxonomic indicator.3 Actually, both psychologists and zoologists bor- rowed problems and techniques from those amateurs who were the major contribu- tors to the science. It is the essentially amateur standing of the early animal be- haviorists that I wish to emphasize in this episodic introduction to the history of a scientific contribution that has so far been unheralded. THE OBSERVERS Before a science of animal behavior could exist there had to be observers of animal behavior. But observing is more than recording. It is the reduction of experienced phenomena to generalities. A collection of facts is nothing but a pile of potential building materials, useless while lying about, but orderable into an edifice by a plan of hypotheses and theories. * Montana State University. 1 Wilhelm Wundt is the best-known repre- sentative of this point of view. See E. G. Boring, A History of Experimental Psychology (2nd ed., New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1950), as well as W. Wundt, Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology, trans. J. E. Creighton and E. B. Titchner (2nd ed., Lon- don: George Allen, 1894). J. B. Watson criti- cized this relegation of animal psychology in his manifesto for a science of behavior, "Psy- chology as the Behaviorist Views It," Psycho- logical Review, 1913, 10:158-177. 2 This aspect of comparative psychology has not been well documented, but I have talked around it in several publications, such as P. H. Gray, "The Descriptive Study of Imprint- ing in Birds from 1873 to 1953," Journal of General Psychology, 1963, 68:333-337; "The Morgan-Romanes Controversy," Proceedings of the Montana Academy of Science, 1963, 23:225-230; "Historical Notes on the Aerial Predator Reaction and the Tinbergen Hy- pothesis," Journal of the History of Behavioral Sciences, 1966, 2:330-334; and "Spalding and His Influence on Research in Developmental Behavior," J. Hist. Behav. Sci., 1967, 3:168- 179. 3 This idea is discussed in relation to ethol- ogy in G.

Few of them contributed to the rise of ethology, which is the study of the behavior of animals in their natural environments, but for one or another reason some have become quite famous. Such would be Gilbert White (1720-1793), curate at Selborne and life-fellow at Oxford. Sometimes called the Addison of natural phenomena, White spent much of his time collecting facts about flora, fauna, and geophysical circumstances in his parish and putting these in the form of letters to such eminent men as Daines Barrington. Even today White is regarded as a par excellence example of what a good naturalist should be. For instance, contemporary ethologists have given White credit for using song pattern as a means of first distinguishing between the three morphologically similar species of the European warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus, p. collybita, and p. sibilatrix.4 Actually what White said was that he did not doubt that there were three species of the willow-wren, of which he knew two perfectly and had yet to procure the third. His description of the so-called smallest and middle willow-wrens suggest he was referring to the willow warbler (trochilus) and the chiffchaff (collybita); his so-called largest willow-wren with its "cantat voce stridula locustae" is perhaps the wood warbler (sibilatrix).5 White was a discerning naturalist; that I would not deny. But as indicated by his complete failure to realize that he had a powerful taxonomic tool at his disposal he lacked that desideratum of a scientist: the ability to generalize. As a critic closer to White's time said, ". . . more must be extracted from facts in their mutual relations, they must be manipulated into the web of some inclusive hypothesis, or otherwise they may as well die an unrecorded death, be- cause their independence only helps to block the already but too narrow path which leads towards true knowledge,"6 and White supplied no such extraction from his facts. Although The Natural History of Selborne is sometimes charming in its emotionless English way, its chief fault is precisely that few generalities are ever advanced that could lead to research, and these few are often egregiously wrong, such as White's belief that some avian species which disappeared from England in the winter were hibernating rather than migrating. More important to science were two men who lived in the century before White. Both were observers who saw the apparent facts and the lawfulness behind them. Francis Willughby (1635-1672) was perhaps the first to break from the anecdotal- ist's tradition of repeating the marvelous exploits of the animal kingdom to tender factual observations instead. Willughby was a well-to-do young man who was first a student of John Ray and later his co-worker. Willughby (ornithologist and ichthyologist) and Ray (botanist and anatomist) collaborated in building a tax- onomic scale which was a major transition between Aristotle and Linnaeus. In- deed, so close was their collaboration that it is sometimes impossible to know where one left off and the other began.7 However, it appears that Willughby was by temperament a generalizer. He is credited with the discovery of territoriality in animals,8 and he seems to have been the first naturalist to suggest that birds are 4 P. Marler and W. J.

His ornithology, completed by Ray in its Latin version and then later translated into English,l? is not well known to behavioral workers. Our second example of a proto-ethologist was historically unknown until Erwin Stresemann connected the man with his anonymously published work."l Johann Ferdinand Adam Pernauer (1660-1731) was a German nobleman who obtained his doctorate at the University of Altdorf at an early age. His books on birdlife are, if one may judge from the extensive excerpts given by Stresemann, products of an extraordinary naturalist. They are also well-nigh impossible to read. The style is that of an educated German nobleman of the period-turgid, grandiose, and God-fearing. But even if his frequent references to God established him as a pious man beyond question, Pernauer (or Pernau) saw more than did men of equal opportunity. He understood that the calls of birds were used in mating, as they might also be used in territorial behavior. He was both field naturalist and avicul- turist; he taught birds to fly out and back into the cage or aviary. He invented methods of building up natural aviaries and was accomplished at raising birds by hand. He gave numerous examples which we may now interpret as behavioral indices of taxonomy. He studied, among other things, territorial habits, migration, call notes, sexual behavior, song as acquired or inherited, and parent-young rela- tionships. He was a man that we should know more about. THE THEORISTS The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers tended to separate man from beast on the grounds that man is a rational being, the only one possessed of a creative imagination and the only one able to recall the past at will. To some thinkers of this era the animals were inferior because they were of lesser intelligence; but to others the animals were inferior to rational man because they acted according to an entirely different principle of motivation, which was called instinct.'2 With the emergence of Christianity the difference between man and animal was drawn upon theological grounds. Reason was denied the animal inasmuch as its possession implied moral responsibility and the possibility of redemption and immortality. In the Middle Ages the Catholic theologians devised sophistries to set man apart from the animals.13 One wonders if there was a strong popular opposition to viewing animals as reasonless and soulless?

It was Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694-1768) who perhaps did the most to restore credence in the theological assumption that a natural and unbridgeable gulf existed between man and the animals that perish. A professor of Oriental languages at Hamburg, Reimarus' main contribution to letters was his work on the historical Jesus wherein he held Jesus to be a very human revolutionary who was imperiling the status quo of his occupied country. But Reimarus takes his place in this narra- tive because of his curious theory of animal motivation. Animals were distinctive, he said, in that they were able to learn very little. But this little they learned rapidly. Apparently the model was that a small bucket fills faster than a large bucket because it holds less. Animals used these little bits of learning to complement their instinc- tive impulses. Humans, on the contrary, because they are gifted with an ability for complex learning, must learn more slowly, and Reimarus offered as witness the prolonged development of the human infant. Further, while animals could establish mental associations, the ideational connections were necessarily of a low order and were prompted entirely by the pain-pleasure principle.15 This "small bucket" theory of animal learning has been curiously persistent, emerging in Darwin's time as a counter-argument for the evolutionary inheritance of behavioral determinants and in our own time as an explanation for the phenomenon of imprinting.16 Although they remained mostly silent, it does not appear that the naturalists quite agreed with either the theologians or the idealistic philosophers. Nor did the more courageous of the philosophers, such as Bruno and Spinoza. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) denied the doctrine of a separate intelligence or understanding in man as distinct from animals.'7 A little later Benedict Spinoza (1632-1677) held that animal emotions (or behavior) differ from man's emotions only to the extent that brute nature differs from human nature. Horse and man both exhibit the desire for procreation, but the desire of the former is equine and the desire of the latter is human. Thus the appetites and lusts of insects, fishes, and birds must needs vary according to the several natures involved. The differences between man and animal are differences of natural law, not the exclusive possession of something spiritual by man.18 Even John Ray, caught between his knowledge of science and his feelings of religion, considered the Cartesian position untenable, for while both brutes and men often act automatically, they also act in ways that involve attention and perception; if brutes do not employ what is strictly called speech, they nonethe- 14 William Turner (1515 ?-1568), Konrad 16 P.

David Hume (1711-1776) held that no truth appeared to him more evident than that the beasts are endowed with thought and reason as well as men. In his major work he said: We are conscious that we ourselves, in adapting means to ends, are guided by reason and design, and that it is not ignorantly nor casually we perform those actions which tend to self-preservation, to the obtaining pleasure, and avoiding pain. When, therefore, we see other creatures, in millions of instances, perform like actions, and direct them to like ends, all our principles of reason and probability carry us with an invincible force to believe the existence of a like cause.20 In this manner did Hume extend to animals the same principles of behavior adduced for humans. This was important, without doubt, for the English philosophers after Hume accepted his arguments, and in so doing, they rendered themselves liable to the comparative logic later forced upon them by the evolutionists. It is a curious fact that in lands and among people where animals are treated as merely objects of utilization, which was seldom the case in Hume's England, no great discoveries are ever made about animal behavior and very few about human behavior. When animals are mentioned in non-Western literature they generally possess mystical or magical qualities; insights into the real laws of animal behavior appear lacking. Among the continental European nations, French philosophy and French literature have always been ambiguous, even contradictory, about animals. Where, for instance, has there been a more evocative and sympathetic picture of an animal than Zola's workhorse which, deep in the mines, dimly remembers the lighted, green pastures where it ran as a colt ? And who has ever been more cynical toward animals than the French Cartesians, who regarded them as automata to the extent that one Cartesian is supposed to have remarked that he liked to kick his dog now and then just to hear the machinery squeak?21 Perhaps it was meet that the man who turned the tables on the Cartesians by arguing that men themselves could be regarded as lawfully constituted automata was also a Frenchman, Julien de la Mettrie (1709-1751). La Mettrie was interested in bringing into perspective the complex relationships between man and animal, relationships which the philosophers had badly distorted. La Mettrie held that no new principles were needed to explain man's behavior, for the transition from animals to man was not violent. Man has a highly developed language with a large cultural heritage of symbols and symbol usage. Man has more wants, more needs, and must work harder, and these pressures lead to inven- tions. Man is still an animal, but a very complicated one, and we will understand him better after we have investigated the real, not fancied, similarities and differ- ences between all living things. He said: Words, languages, laws, sciences, and the fine arts have come, and by them finally the rough diamond of our mind has been polished. Man has been trained in the same 19 J. Ray in C. W.

He has become an author, as they became beasts of burden. A geo- metrician has learned to perform the most difficult demonstrations and calculations, as a monkey has learned to take his little hat off and on, and to mount his tame dog. All has been accomplished through signs, every species has learned what it could understand, and in this way men have acquired symbolic language, still so called by our German philosophers. ... Let us pause to contemplate the varying capacity of animals to learn. Doubtless the analogy best framed leads the mind to think that the causes we have mentioned produce all the difference that is found between animals and men, although we must confess that our weak understanding, limited to the coarsest observations, cannot see the bonds which exist between cause and effect.22 La Mettrie thought that more attention should be given to training animals so that we should have experimental evidence of how much they could learn. He explained how he would take an ape and try to teach it by means of the methods of Johann Conrad Amman, the Swiss educator who pioneered the teaching of speech to deaf children. Unless there were some unknown anatomical differences between ape and man, speech should not be absolutely impossible to the ape. La Mettrie was not interested in denigrating man; no one who wrote so poetically amout man's place in nature could be scornful of mankind. He never forgot that man is still the highest of the animals. Man is to the ape as a very fine watch is to the planetary pendulum, he said. When La Mettrie's faith in the educability of animals was met with the charge that animals do not learn as well as he had hoped, his intellectual successor, Charles Georges Leroy (1723-1789), answered: We see clearly that experience teaches the animals, that is, that their actions are modified by the different trials they have met with, just as our own would be modified; we see that, relatively to their needs, to their circumstances, to the dangers which threaten them, they act precisely as the most intelligent creature would act; and we would throw aside this mass of evidence, because we cannot teach them all that we might wish them to learn?23 Willughby was a wealthy scholar who observed wildlife for a life's interest; Per- nauer was a nobleman who worked with animals for pleasure; Leroy was a noble- man's gamekeeper who studied the behavior of animals as part of his work. He succeeded his father as Ranger of Versailles and Marley under the reign of Louis XV. In temperament he was a product of the French Enlightenment; spiritual questions he left to the priests, working on the assumption that man is merely a superior animal with a greater development of those powers common to man and the higher animals.24 In his collection of letters on animal intelligence and adaptability, published first in 1764 and translated into English about a century later, he became, in spirit at least, our first comparative behaviorist. He held that since we can never understand the nature of the mind of animals, the point is unimportant. But what is important is the increase in our self-knowledge when we sudy the behavior of animals. Just as 22 J. 0. de la Mettrie, Man a Machine, trans. Chapman &amp; Hall, 1870), p. 88. Gertrude C.

Another goal which Leroy defined was at that time unthinkable and has become plausible only in this century. We should have, he said, a complete biography of every species, which would include the species' individual character, natural appe- tites, and its particular way of life. And after this much has been attained the ob- server should endeavor to study it under altered environments to force it to have recourse to fresh solutions. It is only by this observation of the animal in all ages and situations of life that a correct judgment of its instincts and intelligence can be formed. If the animal belongs to a species living in society, either constantly or only for a certain season each year, the additional projects and enterprises super- induced by this association must also be noted.25 Leroy's new science was ambitious indeed, but his ambition was based on what he had himself experienced. He knew animal behavior at firsthand. He described examples of animal conditioning, and he was quite aware of the significance of what we now call social releasers. Although distrusting the Cartesian definition of instinct, Leroy said: "There are doubtless in all animals some dispositions which may be called mechanical, some natural tendencies towards the objects which are proper for them. They must necessarily, without any previous experience, be dis- posed towards some actions needful for the preservation, whether of the individual or of the species."26 He thought animals solved problems much the same as humans did, and he viewed the Reimarian dichotomy between man and animals with sarcasm: He [Reimarus] lays it down that the analogy between the actions of the brute creation and the operations of the human mind is merely apparent, that they cannot have any motives, and that they simply act in the way in which we should have thought. He asserts that the present is everything to them; that yesterday, and still more the day before yesterday, does not exist for them. In a word, he speaks as positively, and his affirmations are as strong, as though his soul had once animated the body of some animal, and had ever since preserved the perfect recollection of its former state. All these gentlemen agree in assuming as a fact that which is the question at issue; they tell you, for instance, that, since animals are irrational beings, therefore they cannot reason.... They declare that animals are born with a perfect knowledge of all that concerns them, and that, without having ever learnt anything, they execute with the most finished accuracy those of their works which depend most upon skill-a fact which the experience of every one who has taken the trouble to examine will pronounce incorrect. But, according to these gentlemen, facts must not be attended to. It is indeed a most novel way of proceeding, to reject facts and base our judgment upon suppositions. ... I well believe that the dog will not have a distinct idea of the set of formal syllogisms which a German doctor would pronounce in a similar case; but his action would be obviously without a motive, or, if you will, would have no sufficient reason, were it not, to say the least, the result of an enthymen of which the two terms are strongly and vividly present to his imagination. Doctors are very liable to confuse reasoning and argument, which are two very different things.27 Although the 1870 translation of his book into English was noted by the contem- porary naturalists, Leroy is seldom mentioned in modern history texts, despite 25 Leroy, The Intelligence and Perfectability 26 Ibid., pp. 184-185. of Animals, pp. 7-14. 27 Ibid., pp. 178-179, 180-181. 378</page><page sequence="8">THE EARLY ANIMAL BEHAVIORISTS his influence in the establishment of ethology and comparative psychology. One reason might be that historians tend to be philosophically rather than experimentally oriented. To the same extent that Leroy encouraged the experimentalists he must have shocked the philosophers, who have a pronounced habit of ignoring those who offend them. Like La Mettrie, Leroy wanted fact over fancy. As he himself said: I am content to see what is, and have never troubled myself to think what ought to be. One of the most formidable obstacles to the real progress of knowledge is this insane rage for presuming, and proceeding to decide upon presumption. It is ridiculous that we, with so limited a knowledge, should pretend to determine the laws of nature.28 Charles Georges Leroy, spiritual founder of the comparative analysis of behavior, would have been at home in any of our modern behavioral laboratories. THE MONOGRAPHERS While historians have adequately discussed the work of such men as Fabre, Forel, Wassman, and Huber pere and fils on the behavior of insects, there has never been any indication how this work could have shaped, or even influenced, an experi- mental study of animal behavior. The simplest hypothesis is that there is no histor- ical indication of a major influence because there was no major influence. The experimental study of animal behavior, in laboratory or field, was pioneered by materialists who, for the sake of discovery of behavioral principles, did not find the greater phylogenetic gap to be between man and all other animals but to be in the more remote reaches of time, perhaps between the terrestrial and aquatic verte- brates and certainly between vertebrates and invertebrates. Regardless of how much the zoologist may deny that the study of animal behavior has relevance to man, and regardless of how little the psychologist may care to affirm that it does, the truth is that man has always been the vantage from which to survey behavior, and the pioneers of animal behavior understood this, as they understood the difficulty of interpreting insect behavior in a comprehensive theory of behavior. The monographers, then, were the animal behaviorists who tacitly carried forward Leroy's program of a biography on each of the higher species. It is interesting that the man who did so much to establish the beginning of such a program was an American of French ancestry who read French well and who used the word "biography" in the title of his magnum opus. American ornithology prospered under Alexander Wilson (1766-1813), but John James Audubon (1785?-1851) added new dimensions to ornithology. First, he 28 Ibid., p. 111. Leroy was more of a theorist than he pretended. For example, he was a supporter of the use-inheritance theory of behavioral adaptation when Lamarck was still a child. He gives as an example the inclinations of hunting dogs to seize and bring back game, inclinations which have been bred into the animal but will disappear if neglected for several generations. Again, the natural disposition of the wild rabbit is to burrow, but tame him and over several generations that part of his instinct con- nected with burrowing will be effaced, to reappear only when the need has continually recurred. Instincts presently in the species were probably once learned actions which became inherited through necessity, said Leroy. He speaks of wants and needs as pres- sures from the environment which force adaptations. He lacked only one notion which would have made him an effective evolu- tionist: the fact that mutation supplies changes for new combinations of genetic material to take up the pressure from the environment. He was heading in the right direction on the wrong road. There is no mention of Charles Georges Leroy at all in any of the histories of evolution that I have looked at. This early theory of habit inheri- tance is in Letter III, pp. 35-52. 379</page><page sequence="9">PHILIP HOWARD GRAY was an artist who drew his subjects in natural poses. Second, he was an animal be- haviorist as perhaps no ornithologist before him except Pernauer had been. Third, and of considerable importance, Audubon was a shrewd experimenter. While Audubon's reports on animal life indicate a careful observer from his first effort,29 I feel that his greatest cleverness was manifested in the series of experiments he initially reported 16 December 1826 to the Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh.30 In his time the belief was prevalent that vultures had a keen sense of smell and that they preferred putrified meat. Audubon's previous observations had led him to doubt the smell hypothesis, and he devised several telling experiments to test it. His subjects were black vultures, or carrion crows. In the first experiment a deerskin was stuffed with hay and sewed up. It was placed with its feet pointing up and apart, with Audubon concealed nearby. Soon a vulture flew over, descended, landed on the carcass, voided, and attacked the painted clay eyes. Failing to enter the carcass there, it tore the stitches out at the rear and then pulled out the hay until the skin was empty. Finally it flew off but coursed near the field where the skin had been laid. Once it landed and killed a small garter snake, but eventually it left the area. In the second experiment Audubon put a dead hog into a ravine and concealed it with briars and high cane. The carcass decayed and some was eaten by dogs, but despite the unbearable smell, no vultures ever found the spoiled carcass. In the third experiment a pig was killed and a blood trail laid to a ravine where the carcass was concealed. Vultures found the blood trail, followed it to the ravine, and located the carcass, which they ate. In the fourth experiment two down-covered vultures were raised by Audubon in a coop. These vultures would hiss and gesticulate to the keeper whenever he ap- proached the coop with food. When the animals had feathered, the coop was en- closed on three sides with the open side turned away from the direction of approach. After that the vultures never reacted prematurely unless Audubon made a noise when bringing food. If he tied food to a pole and held it over the coop, no reaction occurred until the food came within sight. On the basis of these experiments Audubon concluded the vultures cannot smell and that they sometimes wait for putrefaction only because they cannot otherwise break through the hide of some animals. Audubon said: The above account of my experiments was read on the 16th day of December 1826, and was what I may call my "maiden speech." Well do I remember the uneasy feelings which I experienced: the audience was large, and composed of many of the most distinguished men of that enlightened country. My paper was a long one; and it contradicted all former opinions on the subject under discussion; yet the cheering appearance of kindness which everywhere met my eye, as I occasionally glanced around, gradually dispelled my uneasiness, and brought me to a state of confidence. The reading of the paper being at length accomplished, I was con- gratulated by the President, as well as by every member present.3l 29 One of Audubon's first literary efforts Psychology (New York: Norton, 1927). has recently been rediscovered: A.

A young visitor to the Wernerian Society that night, who afterward said that Audubon sneered somewhat unjustly at a pro-smell adherent, was Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882), who never otherwise mentioned these most unusual experi- ments in a field where experimentation had been singularly lacking before Audu- bon.32 In any case, seven years later Audubon asked his friend and collaborator, Reverend John Backman, of South Carolina, to check and possibly extend the experiments, using black vultures and turkey buzzards. The reverend was apparently a cagey person. He set up the experiments with carcasses and had the results wit- nessed by the President of the College of South Carolina and a substantial number of the medical faculty there.33 Darwin never mentioned these experiments, either. There is, of course, no way of telling to what extent, if any, Darwin's later bent toward experimentation may have been determined by the methodological quality of Audubon's research. The goal which seemed so important to Leroy-a complete biography of each of the higher species in all their ages and situations of life-was given more sub- stance by that American who was, I should say, the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word, Lewis Henry Morgan (1818-1881). It is now more than a hundred years since his pioneering effort was published, and the last major animal behaviorist to recognize it was George John Romanes in 1882.34 Morgan was a practicing lawyer who divided his spare time between anthropology and animal psychology. Much of this time he spent in field studies of the social organization of the Iroquois. He was a social theorist of reputation; his evolutionary theory of the progressive stages of culture from savagery to barbarism to civiliza- tion was well received by Marx and Engels. His life and his immense influence in anthropology is well documented.35 In what appears to be his first publication on animals Morgan in 1843 took up the question whether man is entitled to claim unique possession of the Thinking Principle. He adopted the Humian argument that instances of animal action which could be called intelligent if exhibited by humans should be called nothing less because they occurred in the animal world. Animals differ from men mainly in that they do not improve materially from generation to generation, but their needs are few, and there is limited pressure upon them; besides, animals do not have the gregarious principle to the same extent as man. However, the domestic animals may be taught a variety of performances which if done by man we should not hesi- tate to pronounce the result of reasoning. Many species have been taught feats under the stimulus of rewards, said Morgan, and he gave a concise example of the type of learning that Pavlov later called conditioning: 32 C.

She had built her nest by a stone quarry, and during incubation was frequently alarmed by the blasting. She soon learned that the ringing of a bell preceded an explosion, and like the laborers, at this signal she retreated to a place of security. This feat having been discovered, some spectators succeeded in deceiving her a number of times by false alarms. The imposition however was soon detected; and she did not afterward fly at the sound of the bell, unless the workmen also retired.36 Here we have conditioning, extinction, re-conditioning, and discrimination. Under the scientific sun, also, there seems little new! This early paper, as well as an unpublished address given in April 1857, was incorporated into Morgan's book of animal behavior in 1868. We cannot tell when Morgan became familiar with Leroy, nor how. If he read Leroy in the original, it could have been the same 1802 edition that Darwin read. It is possible that Morgan never heard of Leroy, since he does not cite him, but Morgan's enthusiasm rings as an echo of Leroy's voice: A monograph upon each of the principal animals seems, therefore, to be desirable, if not absolutely necessary, to fill out, in some measure, this great programme; and to complete the superstructure of a science, the foundations of which have been so admirably established. These should contain a minute exposition of their artificial works, where such are constructed; of their habits, their mode of life, and their mutual relations. When the facts bearing upon these several subjects have been collected and systematized, the necessary materials will be furnished for the proper elucidation of the long neglected subject of Animal Psychology.37 Morgan's contribution was on the American beaver. As one of the directors and stockholders of the railroad which ran to the iron mines of upper Michigan State, Morgan spent his summers fishing in this virtual wilderness until, beginning in 1861, he gave up the sport for one more appealing-the study of the beaver. He trapped specimens and sent them to anatomists for a thorough study of morpho- logical structures. A team of photographers was taken into the wild for pictorial records of the beaver's work and environment, and I cannot help adding that the engravings made from the photographs are small works of art. Indians were ques- tioned for what information they could give on their neighbor species. And beyond this was Morgan's own painstaking observation of the beaver's habits, limited by an anthropomorphism only partially requited by Morgan's evident desire to be fair to animals. Perhaps following Leroy, Morgan disliked the Cartesian concept of instinct, feeling it should be abandoned as an invention of the metaphysicians to maintain a fundamental distinction between human and animal species. Not a part of any school of naturalists, Morgan used terminology from the popular language, such as imagination, appetites, passions, will, and lunacy in animals. The careful reader, however, will be able to comprehend Morgan by simply remembering that the concepts he used are still a part of psychology, although under new names. Imagina- tion is now insight learning; appetites are now discussed as drives; passions are emotions; will is divorced from its philosophical moorings only by its presently neutral alias, motivation; and the sort of behavior Morgan described as lunacy in animals has been investigated by psychologists under the rubric of frustration. Not so readily dismissed is the main fault in Morgan's attitude toward animal 36 L. H. Morgan, "Mind or Instinct," 37 L. H.

Apparently his creativity as a social evolutionist did not prepare him for biological evolution, for he quite avoided discussions of the evolutionary sig- nificance of behavior. He refers to Darwin not at all, and Darwin quotes Morgan altogether too briefly. The intellectual chasm (with more evidence I should be tempted to call it intellectual rivalry) between Morgan and Darwin was too great to bridge, although Morgan made the only known overt attempt. On his trip to Europe Morgan arranged an appointment with Darwin and went to Down to effect the meeting. It does not appear that they made friends, for Darwin bade Morgan off after feeding him. There appears to be no record of what transpired.38 As far as the Darwin biographers are concerned, the meeting might never have occurred nor Morgan have existed. Morgan's beavers are all but vanished now, obliterated by a civilization less tolerant than that of the Michigan Indians, but a few years ago there was still a chance for them. Manville says: "A proper appreciation of the aesthetic appeal of this rodent should enlist the aid of those in a position to assure his future existence in the country where Morgan first observed him so carefully."39 While he lived, Morgan defended the rights of animals with vigor, as he had de- fended the rights of the Indian. In his last known paper on animal behavior we find him still sympathetic to animal intelligence. He insisted that the instinct con- cept was misleading and scientifically useless because it substituted verbal labels for extended analysis and therefore discouraged inquiry and investigation.40 In that same year (1872), Douglas Spalding demonstrated how wrong this argument was when he published his first paper on the experimental approach to animal behavior, using instinct as a starting point. Whether or not Morgan was aware of this fortuitous rebuttal I do not know. It does not really matter, because Spalding the biological evolutionist would have agreed with Morgan the social evolutionist that the behavior of man and animal utilized the same principles.41 History, that most unkind of the muses, can obscure, as she has obscured many great contributions to animal behavior, but she can never erase. Regardless of where ethology was born, it matured into a research discipline with Lewis Henry Morgan and the 1868 publication of his The American Beaver and His Works. 38 Resek, Lewis Henry Morgan.
