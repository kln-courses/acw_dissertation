<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL ARTICLE On Anamorphosis: Setting Some Things Straight David Topper A namorphosis is having a revival. Post- Renaissance Europe was the setting for its heyday, but an- amorphosis is again finding favor in postmodern culture. Almost weekly, an anamorphic image crosses my desk in a catalog, pamphlet, placard or poster. Perhaps due to the ease of producing anamorphic images using computer graphics, they even appear in newspapers and magazines. They have also invaded my television, and I find them in films and videos. In a new series of books on science, the Humanities Press has emblazoned their covers with an- amorphic images of (so far) Newton and Einstein [1]. An anamorphic depiction of Bill and Hillary Clinton has graced the cover of Newsweek [2]. One of the most famous and popular cases of anamorpho- sis in art history is that appearing in the 1533 painting The Am- bassadors, by Hans Holbein (see Fig. 1). Briefly, Holbein's pic- ture depicts the French envoys to the court of Henry. VIII within a space containing numerous artifacts representing the liberal arts, in particular various trappings of contemporary science and technology. The diagonal blur across the bottom of the picture is really an anamorph, which appears as a hu- man skull when viewed from the upper right. This is probably a multi-layered symbol, but one sure meaning is as a visual sig- nature, since "Holbein" in German means "hollow bone." Anamorphosis is a popular analog used by many postmodern theorists, functioning chiefly as a metaphor for the relativity of vision or the subjectivity of human experi- ence. Yet, surprisingly little has been written on anamorpho- sis itself. There is scant analysis of the phenomenon and less of its history available. The topic needs to be studied, how- ever, mainly because what is written about specific anamorphs is often confusing, and sometimes downright wrong. This is especially problematic for those employing anamorphosis metaphorically [3]. In what follows, I wish not only to point out these common errors and confusions, but also to set the subject straight for further analysis and application. I begin with a discussion and elaboration of the duality at the core of human visual percep- tion. This then sets the stage for an analysis of our perception of anamorphs in which I uncover a number of features of an- amorphic perception that, as far as I know, have never been pointed out before. In the end, I use this analysis to resolve a well-known picture perception puzzle. ANAMORPHOSIS AS METAPHOR: AN EXAMPLE The revival of anamorphosis, especially among postmodern theorists, may at first appear puzzling, due to its seeming re- liance upon notions of objectivity. Postmodernism has grown out of a neo-romantic tradition steeped in subjectivity and a gen- eral hostility to the objectivity of perspective construction, and an- amorphosis is a variant of per- spective. In perspective construc- tion the picture is conceived of as a window, whereby depicted ob- jects (or images) not parallel to the picture plane are foreshort- ened as they are projected onto that plane as seen from a fixed eye position (the projection point). In anamorphosis, the ABSTRACT Recently there has been a revival of anamorphic imagery, no- tably in its use as a metaphor by postmodern theorists. But often, discussions of anamorphosis are confused, and even wrong. In this article, the author not only fo- cuses upon correcting these er- rors, but also analyzes our per- ception of anamorphic images, since there is a dearth of such in the literature. The resulting dis- cussion points out aspects of how we see anamorphs that have never been pointed out before. same geometrical laws are used to stretch (or elongate) a pic- ture or image so that it appears distorted on the picture plane (see Fig. 1). Thus, when the viewer is placed near the projec- tion point of the anamorph (look at Holbein's anamorph from above and to the right) the undistorted image or form appears (it often helps to close one eye in order to see only the projected image). In so doing the viewer, so to speak, "re- forms" the object; thus the term "anamorphosis" was coined, combining the Greek words ana (again) and morphoun (to form). Throughout this article, I use the term "re-form" to describe this visual process. Perhaps the apparent subjectivity of all this (namely, that the world appears differently from different points of view) explains the appeal of anamorphosis among some contempo- rary writers. As a representative example, I have chosen an ar- ticle by Bruno Latour-a widely published, oft-quoted phi- losopher/sociologist of science-in which he uses anamorphosis as a metaphor for the conflict between science and religion from about 1450 to 1550. Latour encapsulates the conflict this way: religion and science "offer completely different definitions of what it is to 'represent' something: to the [religious] re-presentation of the [Divine] Presence is op- posed the accurate [scientific] representation of distant places and times" [4]. Latour uses anamorphosis as a meta- phor because he sees within the phenomenon an opposition between two incompatible viewpoints. He begins, appropri- ately, with Holbein's The Ambassadors, a painting that conve- niently fits into his time period. Latour starts right off by directing our attention to the anamorph-the "strange, elongated brownish shape" near the feet of the ambassadors-even before considering any other features of the picture. Latour thus writes: "If the atten- David Topper (educator, science and art historian), University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB, R3B 2E9 Canada. E-mail: &lt;Topper@UWinnipeg.ca&gt;.

(Original located in the National Gallery, London.) dants at the National Gallery of London allow you to kneel down at the painting's left side [sic], your face as if touching the varnished pigment, this unidentified flying object will appear to be a skull." Hence Latour errs in the placement of the viewer for seeing the skull re-formed. Latour next raises this question: "But then, how will the ... ambassadors appear"? His answer is: "As a grotesque and distorted medley of bright and meaningless shapes." Thus, declares Latour, the two images are mu- tually exclusive: "If the Ambassadors are straightened up, the skull is skewed. If the skull is rectified, the two Frenchmen are slanted, fleeing away like flying sau- cers." And further: "You can reverse at will the definition of what is oblique and unnatural." For Latour this must be an either/or situation. This is crucial to his argument because the skull is a me- mento mori-a reminder of death-and in his interpretation represents the reli- gious world being displaced by the new world of the ambassadors and their sci- entific artifacts. The metaphor works only if the viewpoints are disjointed. Hence, he concludes: "Such is the drama of Holbein's painting. There ex- ists no plane on which both the visible and the invisible worlds could be pro- jected so as to be seen from the same view- point. Either you see one and render the other invisible, or you see the other, and the first becomes a ghost" [5]. Unfortunately, there are two errors in Latour's account. First, as noted, his pro- jection point for the anamorphic skull is off by about 180?; it should be viewed from the upper right corner of the pic- ture [6]. This is a common error; why it is so often made begs for an answer. Sec- ond-and I believe this is lethal to Latour's metaphor-it is not impossible to view (to borrow Latour's terminol- ogy) both the skull unskewed and the ambassadors straightened up, with nei- ther slanted; indeed, they are more of- ten than not seen this way by viewers. This perceptual experience (as far as I know) has never been explicitly stated as such, let alone analyzed in any fashion. VISUAL PERCEPTION: "FLAT-DEPTH" Since anamorphs are modifications of post-Renaissance naturalistic representa- tions of things (at least this is true for the sort of pictures usually employed in an- amorphosis), I begin with an outline of our perception of things in the real envi- ronment, drawing heavily on the percep- tual theory of the late JamesJ. Gibson. I start with the ubiquitous example of our perception of a circular plate. Un- der "ordinary" conditions, and from all angles, one usually sees its form as a circle; this perceptual experience is of- ten referred to as perceiving shape con- stancy. One may also attend to the pro- jection or the perspective viewpoint (that is, the elliptical form), especially when viewing the plate from an extreme angle. Customarily, these perceptions (circles and/or ellipses) are conceived of as two different (and mutually exclu- sive) ways of attending to the object, but Gibson proposed that we can attend to both the shape constancy and perspec- tive viewpoint at the same time. In print, he put it this way: That optical change can seemingly specify two things at the same time, sounds very strange, as if one cause were having two effects or as if one stimulus were arousing two sensations. But there is nothing illogical about the idea of concurrent specification of two reciprocal things. Such an idea is much needed in psychology [7]. In a letter to me, he wrote: I don't believe there is any real issue underlying the distinction between the naive attitude [i.e., perceiving shape constancy] and the perspective attitude in visual perception. We all seem to agree that the distinction between them is valid. The only question is whether or not they are mutually exclu- sive. If I implied that the two different attitudes cannot be taken at the same time, and that the two kinds of percep- tion are never mixed, I was quite wrong. A sort of in-between perceiving does occur. I don't know why. Perhaps for various reasons [8]. This notion of the "concurrent speci- fication of two reciprocal things" or "in- between perceiving" was a radical depar- ture from traditional psychology, implying that the environment yielded dual information. Not only do I believe that this bold conjecture is true, but its confirmation may be found in its fruitful application to our understanding of picture percep- tion-a topic Gibson wrestled with over many years [9]. In short, his conjecture ultimately led to a profound insight about picture perception, which he pre- sented this way: "The information dis- played is dual. The picture is both a scene and a surface, and the scene is paradoxically behind the surface" [10]. A (perspective) picture of real things is an analog of the world; accordingly, since environmental perception is dual ("in- between perceiving does occur"), the pic- 116 Topper, On Anamorphosis</page><page sequence="3">ture in turn contains information of the shape constancy of objects. In other words, perspective in pictures not only captures the projections of the things that are represented but also entails their shape constancy; in the virtual space of the picture the surfaces of objects (not to be confused with the picture's "surface") are perceived as being within that space. Gibson correctly spoke of the "virtual sur- face" of objects in pictures and hence re- ferred to them as "virtual objects" [11]. His realization that information regard- ing shape constancy may be appre- hended within the virtual space of a pic- ture has been supported by experimental evidence [12]. Moreover, Gibson's in- sight appears to be coming to fruition in this age of virtual reality. Gibson's theory of picture perception, in fact, was similar to that of M.H. Pirenne as presented in his seminal little book Optics, Painting, and Photography. Pirenne wrote: "in the usual case of ordi- nary pictures, the spectator is aware of some of the characteristics of the pic- ture surface at the same time as he per- ceives the scene represented by the pic- ture" [13]. Later, in a review article, he spoke of this process as a "psychological integration" of "incompatible things: depth and flatness" [14]. A main aim of the book was to explain the phenomenon of visual compensa- tion: namely, the fact that pictures viewed from almost any angle are gener- ally seen as if viewed orthogonal to their surface. Pirenne's explanation for this was that surface awareness is the visual clue necessarily entailing such compen- sation. The bulk of the book is taken up with a defense of this thesis by, for ex- ample, comparing "ordinary pictures" with trompe l'oeil ones, where the sur- face is not visible. As evidence for his hypothesis, Pirenne uses the huge ceiling fresco Al- legory of the Missionary Work of the Jesuits (1691-1694), by Andrea Pozzo, in the church of St. Ignatius (Rome). Painted in the late seventeenth century on the barrel vault of the nave, the picture is really a giant anamorph that forms at the center of the nave, the spot being marked on the floor with a yellow marble disc. (It is an anamorph because the depiction on the curved surface of the nave is distorted and elongated ac- cording to the laws of perspective.) Pirenne, however, does not acknowl- edge the anamorphic aspect of the ceil- ing; instead, he sees it as a trompe l'oeil, since the ceiling is too far away to reveal the surface information. Hence the viewer may be "tricked" into seeing the painted architecture (for example) as "real." Accordingly, Pirenne argues that compensation is not a factor in viewing the ceiling. To support further his asser- tion, he photographed the ceiling from other places, displaying distorted views of these parts of the ceiling [15]. The philosopher Michael Polanyi, who wrote the foreword to Pirenne's book, also published an article the same year directed to the question, "What is a painting?" In it he spoke of a painting as "a fusion of contradictory features. The flatness of a canvas is combined with a perspectival depth, which is the very op- posite of flatness." He summarized this phenomenon under the succinct term "flat-depth." But Polanyi missed Gibson's insight, for he also alleged that this is a "peculiar quality [of picture per- ception] that is altogether lacking in [our perception of] nature" [16]. In other words, Polanyi failed to realize that dual information is entailed in our perception of the environment, too. Even more important, neither Polanyi nor Pirenne carried the logic further. Per- haps because of their failure to apply the "flat-depth" phenomenon beyond pic- tures, they did not realize that shape con- stancy is also perceived in pictures-at least I cannot find anything close to this concept explicitly in their writings. Thus, Gibson's insight remains his own [17]. Since the "flat-depth" phenomenon ("the concurrent specification of recip- rocal things" or "in-between perceiving") is crucial to the argument developed here, allow me to belabor the point a bit more by quoting, at length, a wonderful passage on this very matter. Describing some drawings by John Constable, the artist/writer Patrick Heron writes: Constable's pencil was . . . miraculous as an instrument for the profoundly in- formative investigation of visual reality. As is the case in all the greatest figura- tive art, our apprehension is two-fold at every instant-as our eyes journey back and forth across the surfaces of his drawings. In every square millimetre there is the double experience for the eye-it savours the design of marks at the surface at the same instant that it sinks through and beyond the gray of pencil and the white of paper to the depths of the outdoor spaces so miracu- lously evoked. It is one of the greatest thrills of the greatest figurative art, this immediate and total identification of marks at the surface with physical spaces and with a multitude of forms in- habiting, and defining, those spaces, through and behind those very marks. The illusion is total; that lopsided stab of a pencil point, itself a mere square millimetre in extent, is a great tree in full leaf, up on the horizon, that pro- claims itself to be precisely half a mile distant from the beholder's eye [18]. To be sure, Heron's observation of this "double experience for the eye," in which "our apprehension is two-fold at every in- stant," is his way of describing the "flat- depth" phenomenon. That the scene and surface of a picture are perceived simulta- neously is probably more obvious to art- ists because of their "hands-on" experi- ence with this phenomenon [19]. I especially encourage the reader to test all this by making any sort of sketch, such as a crude landscape. I am con- vinced that you will immediately realize that the horizon you draw on the paper will be seen as if in the distance, or that a winding road will move through the vir- tual space of the picture as your pencil stays on the flat surface of the paper. In- deed, I submit the following as a truism: if we could not perform this dualistic perceptual feat of seeing "flat-depth," then we could not draw at all! At this juncture, I wish to recall the classic experiments of R.H. Thouless on what he called the "phenomenal regres- sion to the real object." From a fixed viewing point, subjects were shown card- board circles and squares at different oblique angles and were asked to select, from a series of graded cardboard el- lipses and trapezoids, which ones corre- sponded to what they saw at each angle. In essence, he was asking the subjects to try to see the perspective projection of the circles and squares. He found that the subjects chose ellipses and trap- ezoids that were closer to being circular and square than the actual projections; in Thouless' words, the forms the sub- jects selected were "away from the stimu- lus character [and] towards the 'real' [circular] character of the object" [20]. In short, the visual proclivity toward shape constancy mitigated against the "true" projective perspective. However, what is not always realized about Thouless' experiment is that the subjects saw neither circles nor the pro- jected ellipses but something "in-be- tween" (here I purposely employ the same terminology Gibson used in his let- ter to me). Since the subjects were view- ing three-dimensional objects in the en- vironment, shape constancy prevailed even when the subjects tried to discern the projected elliptical stimuli. Now, I submit that the converse hap- pens in picture perception. That is, de- spite our perception of shape constancy in pictures, the perception of virtual ob- jects in pictures entails a proclivity to- Topper, On Anamorphosis 117</page><page sequence="4">ward a realization of the pictorial sur- face, for the pictorial surface of a pic- ture "concurrently" captures the two-di- mensional projection (or perspective viewpoint) of the objects represented. After all, pictures are, in actuality, two- dimensional surfaces, the majority of pictures being downright flat! This is further reinforced by other aspects of pictures: everything is static; there is no real motion parallax; and shapes in the picture preserve their original (geo- metrical) projection-even though illu- sions of motion and rotation may be ex- perienced by viewers. Therefore, we may speak of this proclivity toward the sur- face (in deference to Thouless) as the "phenomenal regression to the perspec- tive structure." This is particularly true when the pictures are photographs, for the camera facilitates our awareness of the projection of things, since (anthro- pomorphically speaking) the camera "sees" the perspective projections of things [21]. The dual nature of perception as de- lineated by Gibson provides theoretical support for this and does not contra- dict the fact that shape constancy is per- ceived in pictures. Experimental sup- port (if not confirmation) is found in the experiments of Sedgwick and Nicholls [22], where subjects viewed a computer-generated perspective pic- ture of a room with a rectangular shape on a wall slanted to the picture plane. The computer was able both to in- crease the slant of the wall (thus chang- ing the projection, or shape of the rect- angle on the surface) and to increase S E the viewing distance of the room (while keeping the surface projection con- stant). For the first case, subjects were asked to estimate the virtual shape (not the projection) of the rectangle on the wall by verbally stating its proportions (that is, the relative width to height); Sedgwick and Nicholls called this the perception of the "scene." In the sec- ond case, subjects estimated the pro- jected (trapezoidal) shape; they called this the "surface." Clearly this experi- ment is a more sophisticated, comput- erized version of Thouless' experiment, where the "scene" corresponds to what Thouless called the "real" shape, and the "surface" to the "stimuli." The re- sults were analogous: Sedgwick and Nicholls found that the estimates of the scene were influenced by the surface, and the surface estimates were skewed toward the scene. They refer to this in- teraction as "cross talk" between the picture surface and the perception of the pictorial scene. In the terminology used here, these important experi- ments show that, on the one hand, per- spective pictures facilitate the percep- tion of the projection of things depicted, and still, on the other hand, the virtual space of a picture (and hence the constancies perceived within) intrudes when we try to attend to the surface. One could also say that in the former case the projection in- trudes when we try to attend to the constancies. Most importantly here, all of this sheds light upon our understanding of anamorphosis. Fig. 2. Geometrical construction of the projection of an ob- ject (0) through a plane or intersec- tion (S) to a fixed viewing point or eye (E). APPLICATION TO ANAMORPHOSIS It is not surprising that the creation and development of anamorphic pictures in European art came not long after the development of linear perspective. An- amorphosis, as noted above, is really a variation of the projective geometry that is at the heart of perspective. Consider, for example, the perspective construc- tion in Fig. 2. An object (say a tiled floor, O) is seen through a window (the pic- ture plane, S) from a fixed point (the place of the eye, E, the projection point). E is also called the station point or the center of projection. By the laws of projective geometry, the floor (consisting of, say, square tiles), when projected onto the pictorial sur- face of the picture (or window, also called the intersection), is transformed into a pattern of trapezoids. Similarly, circles are transformed into ellipses. Furthermore, these squares and circles, when transformed into trapezoids and ellipses, are compressed or foreshort- ened (note the reduced size of the pro- jection of O on S). The essence of anamorphosis may be grasped by considering the previous con- struction, as it were, in reverse. On plane S (at the intersection) is placed a picture (containing, say, squares and circles). Points in the picture are projected onto the plane O along lines starting from point E. Accordingly, projecting slides onto a screen that is not orthogonal to the light beam, as Gibson once did (this will be discussed later), may create anamorphs. The "picture" resulting on O will be an anamorph, in which the "nor- mal" circles and squares on S are trans- formed into ellipses and trapezoids. I use the term "normal" both in the conven- tional sense of how something is com- monly (naively) seen, and in reference to the notion of orthogonality, since the circle is seen as if the viewer were per- pendicular (normal) to the surface. In contrast to the foreshortening in perspective, in anamorphosis the objects are stretched or elongated. The differ- ences may be seen in Fig. 3, where a "normal" circle (N) is compared with its foreshortened version in perspective (P) and its elongated anamorph (A). Thus, when viewing the anamorph from near its projection point, the viewer (by an introspective effort that suppresses the habitual visual compensation) sees the projected image contracted to its "nor- mal" form. The process, however, is not straightforward. Most first-time viewers 118 Topper, On Anamorphosis</page><page sequence="5">do not immediately see the undistorted (re-formed) image; there may be any- where from a few seconds to a minute or more before the re-formed image ap- pears-all of which speaks to the tenac- ity of visual compensation. However, once the compensation is suppressed, the re-formed image pops into view (trapezoids "become" squares, ellipses "become" circles, and so forth). One fac- tor that helps the viewer re-form the anamorph is the fact that the re-formed anamorph is a familiar (undistorted) image, whereas the un-reformed anamorph is strangely distorted. Recall Latour's description of the anamorph in Holbein's painting as a "strange, elon- gated brownish shape" [23]. That visual compensation for the two- dimensional surface in picture percep- tion actually occurs is an experimentally confirmed fact [24]. In particular, the experiments of Rosinski et al. were per- formed to test Pirenne's hypothesis. In these two crucial experiments, the sub- jects were presented with a series of pho- tographs of striped rectangular surfaces originally taken from various angles. In the first experiment, the photographs were viewed monocularly through an apparatus with filters and lighting that eliminated reflections from the surfaces of the photographs. Two viewing posi- tions were used: one perpendicular to the surface of the photographs and the other at a 45? angle. While viewing these images, the subject's task was to use his or her right hand to adjust a board at- tached to a vertical pivot so as to match the slants of the surfaces depicted in the photographs. The results of the experi- ment revealed that "the observers were unable to discount the effects of picture plane rotation on the projected orienta- tion" (presumably because of the lack of surface cues) and therefore "in both viewing conditions judgments were di- rectly related to projected slant"; accord- ingly, "little if any compensation oc- curred" [25]. That is, the viewers perceived the geometrical projections without compensating for the viewing orientation with respect to the picture plane. In the second experiment, the view- ing box was eliminated and the same photographs were viewed binocularly from two viewpoints (one 45? to the left and the other 45? to the right of the pic- ture plane) with ambient room lighting. Under these conditions, the subjects ad- justed the palm board in the same man- ner for the two vantage points, indicat- ing that "a visual compensation process P N Fig. 3. Illustration of an anamorphic elongation (A) and a perspective foreshortening (P) of a "normal" circle (N). Note that this is only a schematic diagram; the ovals are not true ellipses. is capable of overcoming the effects of projective distortion if the picture plane location is specified through full-cue binocular viewing." Thus, these "experi- ments provide one of the first clear and unequivocal demonstrations of the exist- ence of the phenomenon of pictorial compensation." In addition, Rosinski et al. make this inference: "The differences between the two studies indicate that the pictorial constancy occurs only when information for the location of the pic- ture plane is available" [26]. They thus interpret their results as confirming Pirenne's hypothesis, since the viewers saw the projection when the surface was not visible; otherwise they compensated and saw the image as if viewed perpen- dicular to the surface. These experiments help not only to clarify the nature of pictorial compensa- tion but seem to explain why some view- ers never see the re-formed anamorph. Those who see it are apparently able to suppress the surface in order to see the projection; those who cannot, continue to compensate for the surface. At this stage we may take this as a tentative hy- pothesis. Rosinski et al., however, never make this connection to anamorphosis. Surprisingly enough, the connection may be seen by consideration of some of Gibson's early experiments involving the oblique viewing of pictures. Using a standard set-up of projector and screen, he noted that, when the light beam from the projector is perpendicular to the screen, oblique viewing does not re- sult in a distorted image because "there exists an automatic compensation in vi- sual perception for viewing [the screen] at an oblique angle" due to "the simulta- neous perception of the screen as ob- lique," thus anticipating Pirenne's hy- pothesis. Gibson then further confirmed this by projecting the picture at an angle and placing the viewer along the projec- tion axis. The screen image was thus an anamorph (although Gibson did not re- fer to it as such) and the viewer was placed at the "correct" viewing point for seeing the re-formed image. The result: the viewer still saw distortion-thus, constancy prevails over projection-and hence the compensation theory was re- inforced. As he wrote: "The oblique-view compensation seems to be able to pre- serve the 'constancy' not only of a nor- mal picture but also of a distorted pic- ture." But Gibson also noted that one may view the picture "with half-closed eyes" and hence try "to see the picture as an image dissociated from the screen;" as a result, "the distortion di- minishes"-since, as we say, the anamorph re-forms [27]. As far as I know, this is as close as Gibson ever came to the study of anamorphosis. In this analysis, Gibson seems to as- sume (as did Pirenne, Polanyi, Rosinski and others) that surface awareness plays the key role in compensation. Put as a proposition, their position can be stated this way: surface awareness is a necessary and sufficient condition for compensa- tion. From this it follows that: first, with- out surface awareness the viewer cannot compensate; and, second, awareness of surface necessarily results in the viewer's compensation. Thus, a query of the proposition may be broken into two questions: first, can a viewer compensate without an awareness of the surface; and second, can a viewer preserve surface awareness and still not compensate (that is, see the projection)? The answer to the first question must be stated as "yes, but usually not." Al- though experimental evidence shows a correlation between surface awareness and compensation, it is not a necessary one. Recall Pirenne's photographs of Pozzo's ceiling away from the projection point. His assertion that the pictures re- veal visual distortions is problematic since the camera obviously picks up the Topper, On Anamorphosis 119</page><page sequence="6">(distorted) projection, but Pirenne fur- ther contends that the distortions are noticed with the naked eye. Yet contrary evidence (anecdotal, to be sure) is pro- vided in the following passage from the notebook of Rudolf Arnheim, psycholo- gist of perception and aesthetics: M.H. Pirenne's photographs of Pozzo's ceiling painting taken off center at San Ignazio in Rome look indeed awfully distorted. But the other day when I looked at the ceiling in situ, I found that I could stray quite far away from the prescribed spot on the floor of the nave without noticing any distortion worth mentioning. The perceptual constancy of shape, which corrects dis- tortions in physical space, is much less effective in flat photographs [28]. Hence, surface awareness may not be a necessary condition for compensation. In other words, experiments and experi- ence do not preclude the viewer from making the effort (however much re- quired) to preserve constancies. The answer to the second question (Can a viewer preserve surface aware- ness and still not compensate?) is un- equivocally "yes." The evidence, nicely enough, is provided by anamorphosis- for, as shall now be explained, seeing anamorphic projection does not neces- sarily negate surface awareness. Let me begin by raising the following issue: The experience of re-forming anamorphs is often described in terms of seeing the re-formed image "rise and float free above the paper" [29] or "float in space" [30] or "emerge magically from the picture plane" [31]. I contend, on the contrary, that the anamorph re- forms on and below the pictorial sur- face. Evidence for this may be gleaned from some specific anamorphs, such as that in Fig. 4-an anamorph of a bicycle painted on a road. The bottom photo- graph is the anamorph as seen orthogo- nal to the road. In the top photograph, the elongation has been contracted to the re-formed image; alternatively, the viewer may (if able) re-form the bottom photograph by viewing it from an ob- lique angle below the picture. (Of course, this exercise nicely illustrates the "phenomenal regression to the perspec- tive structure" of pictures, namely that photographs facilitate the projective fea- tures of the environment, since it is easier to see the re-formed anamorph in the top photograph.) In both cases, I submit, the re-formed image is seen on the pictorial surface. There seems to be no other interpretation of the visual facts: in the bottom photograph, viewed from an oblique angle, the re-formed Fig. 4. Anamorphic bicycle painted on a bicycle path. From Anamorphoses: Games of Perception and Illusion in Art, M. Schuyt, J. Elffers and F. Leeman, eds. (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1976). (Photo ? Joost Elffers) anamorphic bicycle may be seen-in which case one is, obviously, not com- pensating, yet still seeing the surface. The latter is evident from a consider- ation of the top photograph, since the re-formed bicycle is certainly on the road in the virtual space of the picture, and hence the surface of the bottom photograph is also not suppressed. Thus the re-formed anamorph does not float above the pictorial surface. Instead, the viewer peers across the pictorial surface without compensating and attends to and thus perceives the projected an- amorphic image. Only one conclusion is possible: the previous proposition is false-surface awareness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for compensation (although in most cases awareness does result in compensation). The crucial part of this for the argument developed here is that suppression of surface is not necessary for seeing the projection of an anamorph. Thus the tentative hy- pothesis (above)-that the picture's sur- 120 Topper, On Anamorphosis</page><page sequence="7">face must be suppressed in order to see the re-formed anamorph-has proven to be false. Of course, the anamorph used in Fig. 4 is a special case, since the painted bi- cycle is a flat object; in fact, it is this very flatness that I exploit in my argument. In general, however, anamorphs are (like objects in most pictures) representations of three-dimensional things. Most anamorphs, therefore, when reformed, appear within the virtual space of the picture. This may be verified by return- ing to the anamorph in Holbein's The Ambassadors. It turns out that this is a par- ticularly advantageous example, since the anamorph itself exists within a per- spective picture (unlike most anamor- phic images, where the anamorph is the entire picture). Recall that Holbein's anamorph, when viewed near the cor- rect projection point (from the upper right of the painting), re-forms into a skull. However, note further: this skull does not appear alone. Instead, it is seen within the virtual space of the rest of the picture-indeed, it even casts a shadow in that space! Why Latour and others did not pick up this clue is a mystery to me. The evidence therefore is unequivo- cal: the anamorph is seen within the vir- tual space of the entire picture and hence appears on and below the picto- rial surface. Thus, contrary to Latour's contention, the perception of the re- formed skull does not negate or erase the other objects in the picture; they are not, as he said, mutually exclusive. Rather, the dual nature of picture per- ception comes into play: one sees (if one can) the re-formed image (the surface projection of the anamorph) and, at the same time, perceives the objects in the virtual space of the rest of the picture. It is not an either/or situation. I believe this is fundamentally impor- tant, so allow me to reinforce the point. Consider an object in the picture-say, the foreshortened lute. One may, of course, attend to the elliptical projection of its pictorial surface; more commonly, however, the lute is seen as a three-di- mensional form in space. This volume is perceived as a constant whole from al- most all angular viewpoints of the picture (that is, shape constancy is preserved in the picture's virtual space)-even if the viewer moves towards the projection point of the anamorph, and hence re- forms the skull. Thus the viewer can re- form the anamorphic skull at the same time as the "virtual" lute is perceived. (Of course, at extremely oblique angles, most objects in the picture will usually appear distorted, as compensation ceases.) Ac- cordingly, the skull and the lute are not perceptually mutually exclusive, but pro- vide a striking example of the manifesta- tion of the dual nature of our percep- tion. Latour's metaphor thus collapses. Both the skull and the ambassadors may be "visible" simultaneously, contrary to his contention that they cannot. This, recall, was his second error. His first in- volved the misplaced viewing point for the skull-the next item of business. Why is the projection point for Holbein's skull so often erroneously placed 180? from its correct viewing point? Even someone as knowledgeable as Martin Gardner, in an essay on an- amorphosis in his "Mathematical Games" column for Scientific American, got it wrong. Like Latour, Gardner pro- posed a viewing point to the lower left of the painting, and further writes that "Holbein's painting was probably in- tended to hang near the top of a stair- way so that people going up would be startled by the skull" [32]. Actually the picture should be hung at the bottom of a stairway since the viewing point is from the upper right corner [33]. Most pictures are usually viewed ap- proximately orthogonal to their surface. If not, then they are customarily viewed from below (since pictures are often placed high on museum walls, or are sometimes even executed to hang that way). There is therefore a propensity to assume that the skull, if not made to be viewed straight on, should then be seen from below. As an attempt to under- stand why the left viewpoint is errone- ously chosen, this makes sense. But there must be a deeper reason for the frequency of this error; or, to put it an- other way, the re-formed anamorph must somehow be partially visible from this wrong viewpoint, for otherwise the error would immediately be noted. That reason is to be found partially in the geometry of the skull. Look again at Fig. 3: there is an important but counterintuitive feature of both per- spective foreshortening and anamor- phic elongation as the image departs from the norm. Whereas squares distort into trapezoids that are symmetrical about only one axis, circles distort into ellipses that preserve their symmetry about two axes. The difference is not in- tuitively obvious; indeed, even Thouless got it wrong [34]. Yet it is this symmetry of circles and ellipses-and hence also of other quasi-circular, oval and spheri- cal objects (notably, skulls)-that per- mits a seemingly correct viewing of such anamorphs from actually the wrong (op- posite) point. And, in the special case of an anamorph of a purely geometrical circle, both viewing points are correct. However, there is more. Look again at Fig. 3: although the ellipse (in A) is sym- metrical about both axes, the cross (like the trapezoid) is not-it is skewed to one side. This means that when viewing an anamorph from the wrong (oppo- site) point, although the overall struc- ture (or outline) will re-form into a circle, the internal features will be skewed within the ellipse-in fact, they are skewed further from their anamor- phic elongation. That the wrong (opposite) viewing point is so often specified therefore indi- cates that viewers may be reforming only the outline of the anamorph into a circle, not the details within. This re- veals that many viewers (sometimes even authorities, it seems) do not look very closely. What they think they are see- ing--or perhaps want to believe they are seeing-seems to run ahead of their per- ceptions. Furthermore, the fact that they do not see the further skewing may be explained by the dual nature of pic- ture perception: they see the outline re- formed and at the same time compen- sate with respect to the internal structure. The reader may initially test this hypothesis by looking at Holbein's skull both from the upper right (cor- rect) and lower left (wrong) viewpoints. The following demonstration, I am convinced, confirms all of this. Figure 5 is my copy of the first anamorph we know of-the drawing of a child's face from one of Leonardo da Vinci's note- books [35]. The correct viewing point is to the right of the drawing. Figure 6 is a photograph of the drawing from the right, estimated as near the correct view- ing point. (The exact point cannot be specified since there are no lines of per- spective from which to derive the vanish- ing points.) Clearly the anamorph re- forms into a child's face. Figure 7 is a photograph of the draw- ing taken at an angle of about 180? from that in Fig. 6, namely at the wrong (op- posite) viewing point. Looking passively (or naively) at Fig. 7, that is, without an active inspection, a viewer may not (in- deed, probably would not) notice any distortion; rather, the face appears as seemingly re-formed. (Of course, as be- fore, the camera facilitates this "projec- tive" perception; thus the reader may wish to test all this further by viewing Fig. 5 from both viewpoints.)

Author's drawing of the re-formed anamorph of Fig. 5 from approximately the projection point. comparison of Figs 6 and 7, however, re- veals that in Fig. 7 the internal features of the face are distorted, especially the child's right eye and the outline of the chin. Clearly, though, a passive look at Fig. 7 misses this. Hence the wrong (op- posite) viewing point for anamorphs is a symptom of passive (naive) looking- aided by the geometry of the situation. However, this is not an excuse for miss- ing what should be seen, especially by those writing on the subject [36]. Lastly, Fig. 6 provides further visual evidence for another argument: that the re-formed image does not float above the pictorial surface. Note how the child's face is on (or within) the surface of the paper, and also that this surface- qua surface-is not suppressed. If I am right on this, then a remark on its application to the following well- known perceptual puzzle is called for. THE PICTURE-IN-A-PICTURE PUZZLE Simply put, the puzzle is this: why does a picture-within-a-picture (the former at some angle to the picture plane and hence foreshortened) appear distorted whereas the picture itself, from any angle, does not? An example used by Pirenne shows former United States president Richard Nixon in front of a campaign poster of himself; since the camera was to the right of Nixon, the poster is slanted with respect to the camera's plane and thus Nixon's image in the poster is distorted [37]. Pirenne's answer-which has been adopted by al- most everyone [38]-is that the viewer compensates for Nixon due to surface awareness of the picture itself, but the poster, being in the picture, lacks such information and thus appears distorted. In fact, Pirenne's argument is less an ex- planation of the puzzle and more a test case providing evidence for his hypoth- esis of surface awareness. There may be a simpler (or at least another) explanation. Independently of whether the surface of the poster is sup- pressed or not, the poster will be dis- torted, since the picture itself is a photo- graph and thus the projection of the poster will be picked up by the camera. Initially, this explanation may seem to contradict the argument developed at length in the first part of this article re- garding the perception of constancies in the virtual space of pictures. However, a moment's reflection should clarify this: the fact that such constancies are per- ceived does not preclude the awareness of the projection of things (recall "in-be- tween seeing"), and posters (or pictures- in-pictures), being flat things, tend to re- veal their projections more than three-dimensional objects. Moreover, the distortions produced by many varieties of a picture-in-a-picture are not even no- ticed by the casual (passive/naive) viewer. Finally, to reinforce all this, consider Fig. 8, my drawing of the child's head re- formed, made by eyeing the copy of Leonardo's anamorph at the viewing point. Figure 9 is the same drawing pho- tographed at approximately the same angle at which the anamorph was photo- graphed in Fig. 6. The resulting distor- tions are obvious. Alternatively, looking attentively at Fig. 8 from an extreme angle (perhaps with one eye), the viewer may see such distortions. But the cam- era-as revealed in Fig. 9, and to echo a theme of this paper-"sees" the perspec- tive viewpoint and facilitates our aware- ness of the projection of things. SUMMARY In sum: in this article, I have applied Gibson's bold conjecture about the dual nature of visual perception to the study of anamorphosis. This is the first such application that I know of. It is also the first place where it has been pointed out that the projective viewpoint does not necessarily negate surface awareness, es- pecially for anamorphs. I have explained why the wrong (op- posite) viewing point for the anamor- phic skull in Holbein's The Ambassadors is so often chosen, and have presented the observation of the non-mutually exclu- sive relation between the anamorphic and non-anamorphic forms in Holbein's painting; that is, that the anamorphs re- form within the virtual space of the pic- ture. I performed preliminary experi- ments to support the argument here and, finally, I have presented a possible application of this analysis to the well- known picture-in-a-picture puzzle. In the course of setting straight the muddle around the phenomenon of an- amorphosis, I hope that I have thrown some light upon this marvelous process of re-forming these wonderfully dis- torted forms-particularly revealing what we may see when we take the time to stop, to analyze and especially to look, really look.

A source-if not the source-of Latour's contact with anamorphosis is surelyJacques Lacan. In his widely cited Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho- Analysis (A. Sheridan, trans. [New York, NY: W.W. Norton, 1978]), Lacan exploits the anamorph in Holbein's painting as a model for his concept of the "gaze" (see Chapter 7, "Anamorphosis"). This may also be the source of Latour's error, for Lacan erro- neously cites the viewing point "to the left" of the painting (p. 92). Lacan's source of information on anamorphosis is Baltrusaitis' book [3], which he ex- plicitly cites, but apparently did not carefully read, since Baltrusaitis clearly states that the skull "is re- stored to normal" by "looking down on it from the right" (p. 91). If Latour is one of the most cited re- cent philosopher/sociologists of science, Norman Bryson is probably his counterpart for art. Not sur- prisingly, Bryson also extensively quotes Lacan, and in an essay on "The Gaze in the Expanded Field," in Vision and Visuality (H. Foster, ed. [Seattle, WA: Bay Press, 1988] pp. 87-108), Bryson refers to Holbein's painting to explain his concept of "visuality." Bryson does not direct the reader to the viewing point; but even if he did we would not know if he were correct because the reproduction of Holbein's painting in the book (p. 93) is reversed!

He first referred to it in a footnote, calling Pirenne's book a "useful book ... that clarifies the little-understood phenomenon of perspective dis- tortion in pictures." (Gibson, "The Information Available in Pictures," Leonardo 4, No. 1, 27-35 [1971]). However, he went on to comment that, un- like himself, Pirenne "accepts the eye-camera anal- ogy" so that his (that is, Gibson's) theory of percep- tion should seem "very strange" to Pirenne (p. 34n). 18.

However, none of this really is obvious. Indeed, the prevalent idea among theorists is that picture surface and subject matter are mutually exclusive- perhaps because it has been so forcefully presented by E.H. Gombrich in his seminal book, Art and Illu- sion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation (London: Phaidon Press, 1960), where he makes an analogy with the popular rabbit/duck illusion. Patrick Maynard reviews the contemporary debate on this matter (what he calls "double-seeing") among Gombrich, the perceptual psychologist Rich- ard Gregory, the philosopher Richard Wollheim and others. In an insightful statement, Maynard ar- gues in support of "double-seeing" by a counter ex- ample. If the perception of surface and scene were mutually exclusive, he argues, then "the differences among our experiences of a Kokoschka flower painting and ones by William Nicholson, Pandora Sellers ... or Manet would seem to be reduced to flower arrangements and lighting."

Sedgwick and A.L. Nicholls, "Cross Talk between the Picture Surface and the Pictorial Scene: Effects on Perceived Shape," paper pre- sented at the European Conference on Visual Per- ception (August 1993). Some theorists, however, try to get around the dualism by finding direct infor- mation in the geometry of the pictorial layout. See J.E. Cutting, "The Shape and Psychophysics of Cin- ematic Space," Behavior Research Methods, Instru- ments, Computers 18 (1986) pp. 551-558; and T.O. Halloran, "Picture Perception Is Array-Specific: Viewing Angle versus Apparent Orientation," Per- ception and Psychophysics 45 (1989) pp. 467-482. There are also attempts at explaining compensa- tion by geometrical constraints within the pictorial layout (see D.N. Perkins, "Visual Discrimination between Rectangular and Nonrectangular Parallelopipeds," Perception and Psychophysics 12 [1972] pp. 396-400), but they still rely on knowl- edge of the picture plane. A penetrating critique of various hypotheses involving projective equiva- lences in picture perception is found in the two ar- ticles by K.K. Niall andJ. Macnamara [12]. 23. From a geometrical viewpoint, marginal distor- tions are anamorphs. Consider again Fig. 2: move point E vertically to extreme angles, and the projec- tion on S is now longer than O; hence an anamorph is formed. One can see this by simply looking at a scene through a window and drawing on the win- dow (say, with a felt pen) the projected objects on the extreme sides (margins) of the window. When I show this to students, they are invariably amazed that they never "saw" these anamorphs before. The reason is simple: marginal distortions are only on the window; when we turn our heads and peer through the glass, they disappear (because, in fact, they were never there!). I thankJohn Ward of the University of Florida (Gainesville) for clarifying this and other matters about perception and perspective in our many exchanges over the years. 24. D.N.

Space does not permit a further discussion of this, but mention should be made of the important research in per- ceptual psychology by Adelbert Ames. Any reader familiar with his many constructions of what later were called "Ames rooms" (or "Ames demonstra- tions") will realize after a moment's reflection that aspects of the phenomenon are variants of anamor- phosis. In light of the role of Gibson's ideas on pic- ture perception in this paper, it is of more than passing interest to relate the following. Gestalt psy- chologist Fritz Heider, who was acquainted with both Gibson and Ames, mentions in his notebooks that Gibson was almost irrational in his dismissal of Ames' demonstrations, which he called "peephole experiments." Yet, Heider notes that Gibson himself sometimes used peephole demonstrations. See F. Heider, The Notebooks, Vol. 2: Perception, M.

Rudolf Arnheim, Parables of Sunlight: Observa- tions in Psychology, the Arts, and the Rest (Berkeley, CA: Univ. of California Press, 1989) p. 233. Two pa- pers by M. Massironi and U. Savardi, ostensibly on anamorphosis, bear comment. The first, although titled, "Why Anamorphoses Look as They Do: An Experimental Study" (Acta Psychologica 76 [1991] pp. 213-239), strangely never deals with the key phenomenon-the re-forming of anamorphs. The experiments involved projecting images at oblique screens of various angles; the images were a line segment, a row of dots and a circle. At no time, however, were the viewers ever placed at the projec- tion point, and hence the experiments have little or no bearing on the reforming of anamorphs. In- deed, the experiments were directed less to under- standing anamorphosis and more to disproving the role of the cross-ratio as an invariant. The second paper, on "The Ceiling of the Church of St. Ignatius and the Perception of Concave Surfaces" (Perception 20 [1991] pp. 771-787), begins with the odd assertion that their "research describes two hitherto unobserved phenomena" in Pozzo's fresco. However, the distortions that they photo- graph from various angles in the church are all found in Pirenne's book! For the experiments, the authors constructed a model of Pozzo's ceiling us- ing a dimly lit corridor and projected the same im- age as in the first paper. The qualitative results, un- der such conditions, were that the subjects saw the projected shapes-perhaps not a surprising result. Thus, both experiments throw little light (pun in- tended) upon our perception of anamorphosis, mainly because they were too abstract and far re- moved from the ecological conditions of our expe- rience of anamorphs (such as Pozzo's ceiling). 29.

Alison Cole, Perspective (London: Dorling Kindersley, 1992) says that Holbein's skull "seems to float above the picture surface" (p. 33). 32. M. Gardner, "The Curious Magic of Anamor- phic Art," Scientific American (anuary 1975) pp. 110-116, quote on p. 110. 33. Richard D. Zakia makes the same error in "An- amorphosis and Anthropomorphism in Photogra- phy," Exposure 16 (1978) pp. 10-15, quote on p. 11. Zakia may have been misinformed by Gardner [32], since he begins by noting that he became interested in anamorphosis after reading Gardner's article. Cole says that Holbein's painting was probably made to hang on a stairway "so that the corrected skull may have appeared from below left, or above right, as the viewer went up or down the stairs [31 ]." This confusion of the viewing point is strange be- cause on the same page she has a drawing of how the skull was made using a perspective grid and cor- rectly states that the "corrected" skull should be viewed "from the right-hand side of the drawing" (p. 33)! I should point out that the case has been made that the skull also appears reformed when viewed through a glass cylinder. See E.R. Samuel, "Death in the Glass-A New View of Holbein's 'Am- bassadors,"' Burlington 105 (October 1963) pp. 436- 441. But a recent, detailed study of Holbein's paint- ing, completed after a cleaning and restoration of the work, counters Samuel's claim and shows in- deed the correct viewing point to be the upper right side. Yet, strangely enough, it seems that the paint- ing was never hung at the bottom of a stairway in the chateau for which it was commissioned! See S. Foister, A. Roy and M. Wyld, Making and Meaning: Holbein's Ambassadors (London: National Gallery Publications, 1997) pp. 28-29 and 50-55. 34. As Thouless erroneously wrote, "The perspec- tive shape [of a foreshortened circle] is not, of course, exactly an ellipse, but a figure resembling an ellipse with one of the short semi-axes longer than the other." Thouless [20] 21, 340n. He was clearly following his intuition in assuming that what happens to the square should happen to the circle; but, in fact (almost paradoxically), the distorted circle preserves two axes of symmetry as it trans- forms into perfect ellipses. Ironically, Thouless used ellipses for the stimuli in his experiment, since he thought they were a close approximation to the "correct" figures. Indeed they were! 35. See Baltrusaitis, Anamorphic Art [3] p. 33, for a reproduction of the original. 36. Since the anamorphs being discussed involve the depiction of faces-and I assume skulls may be sub- sumed under that category-there is another pos- sible factor mitigating against the perception of such distortions that has been delineated in the experi- ments of T.A. Busey, N.P. Brady and J. Cutting, in "Compensation Is Unnecessary for the Perception of Faces in Slanted Pictures," Perception and Psychophys- ics 48 (1990) pp. 1-11. Using the photograph of a face for a stimulus, they found that within a range of approximately 22? to the normal, viewers tolerated the distortions resulting from such slanted pictures. Such a tolerance may be operating for the anamorph, too. However, there are two possible dif- ferences between anamorphs and slanted photo- graphs. First, the viewing angle of the anamorph is far beyond the 22? limit, but this may not be relevant since the reforming of the image is towards normal- ization and away from distortions. Thus, tolerance may be a factor here. Second, as seen above, the geo- metrical distortions are different: the slanted photo- graph undergoes foreshortening, not anamorphic elongation. However, since there is a geometrical continuum between them, then the perceptual tol- erance verified for the slanted photographs may have a counterpart in the anamorphic distortion- assuming there is a corresponding perceptual con- tinuum between them, too. 37.

Perhaps a more ap- propriate example today would be the photograph that appeared in most newspapers in the world on 7 August 1997 showing Apple Computer's Steve Jobs standing on a stage in front of a large screen where Microsoft's Bill Gates appeared via satellite. In the photograph, Gates appeared distorted, whereas Jobs did not. Manuscript received 29June 1998. 124 Topper, On Anamorphosis</page></plain_text>
