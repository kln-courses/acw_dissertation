Purchase $340 (16mm), $240 (video), rental $30 plus $5 postage, from University of California, Extension Media Center, 2223 Fulton Street, Berke- ley, CA 94720 Discovering the Moche is an exceptional film, quite different from the standard fare in archaeology movies. One of the filmmakers, Christopher Donnan, is a prominent archaeologist who has taken time off from his teaching, excavations and museum studies to make the results of his research accessible to a broader public. The subject of the movie is one of the pre-Inca cultures of Peru. Aside from the occasional short on the Incas, there has been little cinematic interest in any aspect of the complex prehistory of the Andes, and almost any competent film on Prehispanic Peru would be a welcome addition to the existing corpus of archae- ological films. The film focuses on Moche art and its interpretation as a form of symbolic communication. Archaeologists are be- coming increasingly interested in trying to understand the ideology of Prehis- panic societies, despite the obvious diffi- culties in dealing with this nonmaterial aspect of ancient culture. Art, especially representational art such as that of the Moche, provides one of the best sources for such studies, and Donnan has pio- neered the development of contemporary approaches to Moche iconography. This movie presents a lucid explanation and demonstration of the way in which ar- chaeologists attempt to wrest meaning from art to understand prehistoric soci- eties more fully. Moche art (also known as Mochica art) was produced in several coastal valleys in northern Peru roughly between 0-700 A.D. The modeled and painted ceramic bottles found in art museums throughout the world are probably the best known examples of Moche art. These ceramics have often been inter- preted as a sort of prehistoric ethnog- raphy of the ancient Moche in which scenes from everyday life are accurately portrayed in clay. Most of these museum pieces probably come from looted tombs where they had been placed as offerings to the dead, but similar Moche-style pottery has also been found by Donnan and others among the ruins of the cities, towns and villages where the Moche lived. The pottery illustrated in Discovering the Moche has been selected with great care from the finest public and private collections in Peru and the United States. Moche art is one of the world's great art styles, and the film would be worthwhile solely for the aesthetic pleasure these ceramics provide. The quality of the photography is excellent, and the tradi- tional Andean highland music played by an ensemble from Cuzco effectively rein- forces the frequent scenes of traditional Quechua life which appear throughout the film. The narration is clear, although somewhat conventional. Best suited for an audience of educated non-specialists, the film would also be appropriate for advanced high school students or under- graduates. Inclusion of some examples of Moche "erotic" art, however, might make the film unacceptable to school boards dominated by the Moral Majority. The film begins with some breathtak- ing aerial photographs of Machu Picchu but quickly moves from the known to the unknown, shifting attention to the arid coast of Peru. In a short sequence, the viewer is taken on a tour of the dif- ferent microenvironments of the north coast. Prehistoric Moche culture is intro- duced in the following segment, and while some of the salient characteristics of the culture are enumerated the viewer is treated to views of the massive adobe constructions of Moche, a poorly pre- served fragment of a Moche mural, and an elaborate Moche burial in the process of excavation. After this five-minute introduction attention focuses on Moche art, which Donnan argues must be understood "on its own terms." In order to accomplish this, Donnan considered more than 100,000 museum specimens and found that, despite the at first bewildering diversity, there are actually fewer than 15 basic scenes represented on the ce- ramics. These scenes are most fully shown on the painted Moche V bottles which are illustrated in the movie with roll-out drawings. Many of the modeled bottles actually depict elements from these scenes. The major themes could be represented in greater or lesser detail and still be understood by the Moche people, just as we recognize the "Nativity Theme" whether or not the wise men and camels are included. The film clearly places the thematic aspect of Moche art within the broader context of religious art and ideology. Donnan suggests that the intent of Moche art was not primarily to depict scenes or aspects of everyday life. It was religious art, and the themes it depicts express aspects of the belief system concerning ritual and the supernatural. Donnan makes extensive use of his- toric accounts and ethnographic infor- mation from coastal Peru to illuminate some of the details of the iconography. Use of ethnographic analogy provides some of the most memorable moments 66 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">of the film. Moche curing scenes, which incorporate many shamanistic elements, are convincingly compared to modern folk-healing practices. To illustrate this, Eduardo Calderón, a curandero from Thi- jillo, is shown fighting evil spirits while under the influence of a mescaline-based drink during an all-night curing session. Items which modern curanderos use as objects of ritual power can be identified in Moche iconography. For example, the strands of seeds held by figures in Moche pottery are recognized as espingo seeds imported from east of the Andes and still sold at markets for curing super- naturally induced illnesses. Similarly, the Moche representations of sea lions and sea lion hunts are generally shown with an anomalous round object either in or in front of the creatures' mouths. Accord- ing to Calderón, these objects represent stones which sea lions cough up when they are hunted. The stones are highly valued by modern curers. The film also provides compelling examples of the value of historic docu- ments for interpreting iconography. Father Calancha's seventeenth-century account of the north coast includes a myth in which a louse-infested witch named Mollep prophesied that the people would multiply just as the lice multiplied on his body. Donnan relates this myth to two Moche vessels depicting fanged anthropomorphic figures- the body of one figure is covered with lice-like crea- tures, while on the other figure human representations are substituted for the insects. These and other examples con- vincingly illustrate the application of ethnographic and ethnohistoric analogy to the iconographie analysis of Moche art. It is unfortunate that the film does not include a short discussion of the possibility of shifts in the meaning of symbols or themes over time. This omis- sion, however, could serve as a useful springboard for classroom discussions after the film. More importantly, the weaving together of ceramics, historical accounts and ethnography does convey a feeling for the special texture of ancient Moche culture. A minor but distracting flaw occurs at the outset of the film when the camera focuses on excavations of Moche refuse. The presence of shovels and the cavalier way in which the soil is tossed into the screen to select a few significant artifacts for the viewers is understandable to those of us who have worked in the field and know the difference between cinema and fieldwork, but it is disturbing to introductory students who are being taught the need for meticulousness in excavations. A limitation of the film is its superficial treatment of Moche society. The study of ideology, while interesting in its own right, is best understood against the backdrop of the particular political, economic and social configurations of the culture in question. While Discover- ing the Moche leaves the viewer with a clear impression of many aspects of Moche thought and culture, this vision remains somewhat detached from its broader context. These issues, of course, are tangential to the film's main purpose. But Discovering the Moche is so suc- cessful in achieving its objectives that this reviewer hopes that the filmmakers may someday produce a companion to this film which will focus on ancient Moche society and the contribution that archaeological fieldwork has made to its study. In the meantime, Discovering the Moche will provide an enjoyable and memorable introduction to the ancient Moche and to the archaeological study of Prehispanic iconography. Richard L .
