My Lords, may it please your Lordships,— I propose to argue in my own defence the entire groundlessness of the charges brought against me, by showing— (1.) That not one incriminated passage of all those cited from my books contradicts any statement of the Articles or Creeds in their plain literal sense. (2.) That what I have contradicted are popular glosses upon the Articles, not parts of the Articles themselves. (3.) 1 shall also cite instances from the writings of celebrated divines, of unimpeached orthodoxy, in which they have stated views more or less in accord¬ ance with my own, and at variance with the popular glosses upon the Articles and Creeds, which I am now being prosecuted for contradicting. (4.) In the second part of my appeal, assuming for the time that I may have, in some instances, traversed one or more of the Articles, I shall plead that it will be unjust to condemn me, and only strict justice to acquit me. I shall examine some of the leading Articles in detail, and show how the Clergy of all shades of opinion, and of all ranks, habitually traverse the Articles quite as much as I am accused of doing; for I can show that no one man amongst us all</page><page sequence="6">6 INTRODUCTION. can, with equal clearness of perception and integrity of mind, accept all the statements in the Articles and Creeds in their literal and plain sense; and, therefore, that it would be an act of the greatest injustice to single out any individual or number of individuals for special condemnation. (5.) Lastly, I shall endeavour to set forth, in terms as clear and as brief as possible, what I have taught and endeavoured to teach, and why I have done so; for I honestly believe that all the main and essential points of my teaching are not only true in themselves—so far as truth is discoverable at all on these subjects—and de¬ rived from the teaching of the Bible, and especially the teaching of the Great Founder of Christianity himself, but that they are also supported at every step by the positive declarations of our Articles and Creeds. If I can succeed in showing this, as I confidently hope to do, it will be the highest justification of my con¬ duct, as a minister, which I could desire. To have spoken what is true, and in accordance with the laws of the Church, in the face of great opposition, misrepresentation, and public odium—now happily giving place to public regard—is to have discharged the sacred functions of a minister of Christ's Church, and a servant of this exalted realm, and to have fulfilled the sacred pledge of my ordina¬ tion vows, which bind me " to instruct the people committed to my charge out of the Scriptures, and to teach nothing as required of necessity to</page><page sequence="7">EXAMINATION OP ARTICLES OF CHARGE. 7 eternal salvation but that which I myself shall be persuaded may be concluded and proved by the Scripture." (See Ordination Service for Priests.) I now proceed to the first part of my argument, and will endeavour to show that not one of the incriminated passages cited from my sermons in the Articles of Charge contradicts the Articles of Religion in their plain and literal sense. The Articles of Charge show that my prosecutors have been absolutely unable to find any pair of state¬ ments, viz., one from my sermons and one from the Articles of Religion, which are directly contradictory. I might almost content myself with saying this, and throwing on them the burden of discovering any two such contradictory statements; but I will ex¬ amine every charge in detail. The Articles of Religion cannot be suffered to have any gloss or interpretation put upon them. They must not be made to bear more or less meaning than the plain literal sense which the words convey. The passages from my sermons ought, therefore, when made the subject of criminal proceedings, to be read with the same exactness. I disclaim the intention of contradicting the Articles. If I have anywhere done so, it has been through oversight and want of suffi¬ cient care in the choice of expressions. I have ever been mindful of my duty in this respect, and have always endeavoured to frame my expressions so as not to say anything which the law forbade me to say. The law has nothing to do with the thoughts</page><page sequence="8">8 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. of the heart, nor can it compel a man to throw him¬ self into the spirit of a system, or to conform to the prejudices and tastes of any particular age. Upon the question of conscience I should be most happy to meet my accusers, but I must not trouble the Court with it. What my prosecutors have here to do is to bring into juxta position a single statement of my own with another statement from the legal formu¬ laries as an instance of direct contradiction; and I say they have not done it. Under the first of the four groups of charges of accusation, there are four direct Articles of Charge, viz., Articles x., xi., xii., xiii., supposed to be based on all and each of the extracts preceding them, and contained in Articles of Charge from vii. to ix. inclusive. The Articles of Religion said to be contravened by those extracts from my books are the Ilnd, Illrd, XVth, and XXXIst. Now in Article of Charge x., I am charged with having— " Maintained or affirmed and promulgated the doc¬ trine, position, or opinion, that Christ has not made an atonement or reconciliation for sin, and has not been made a sacrifice to reconcile His Father to us, or a doctrine, position, or opinion, to that purport or effect." This, I suppose, means that I have denied that Christ has made an atonement for sin, etc., etc. This charge, no doubt, alleges on my part a distinct con¬ tradiction of the Articles of Religion, which cannot</page><page sequence="9">FIRST GROUP—DOCTRINE OF ATONEMENT. 9 be legally allowed to a clergyman of the Church of England. But the charge is false in fact. Never have I affirmed that " Christ has not made an atonement for sin"; never have I said that " Christ has nob been made a sacrifice to reconcile the Father to us," etc. On the contrary, I have, in express terms, taught that the death of Christ was a sacrifice for sin. In one of the passages cited against me (see Articles of Charge, p. 8, quotation Q), I have said, " In one sense Christ was indeed a sacrifice," and " sin caused his death." I have nowhere else contradicted myself, or the Articles, on this head. I have all along intended to disprove, deny, over¬ throw, or undermine certain popular theories of the relation between God and man, and at the same time I have been studious to avoid using language at variance with the Articles. I know also, and my accusers know, that this is literally true, and that if I am condemned for my language on this point, quoted in Articles of Charge vii. to ix. inclusive, I shall be condemned, not for contravening the Articles of Religion in their plain literal sense, but for con¬ travening certain popular theories which are not essential portions of the Articles and Creeds; and for doing so by language carefully framed to attack those theories, and to avoid collision with the Articles and Creeds. As no one has a right to add to the Articles of Religion what to him tbey seem to imply, and then to incorporate that implication in the Articles them-</page><page sequence="10">10 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. selves,—as, in plain English, every one is bound only by what the Article says, and not by any supposed basis of it or deduction from it,—so, in bringing my statements into comparison with the Articles, strict justice requires that the ipsissima verba only shall be taken in their literal sense, and not any inferences which might be drawn from them. For example, I have denied the necessity for our reconciliation with God by the death of an innocent. I have denied that by words which in their plain sense mean that and nothing more. I have nowhere denied that the death of Christ reconciled the Father to us. If I have, let the passage be produced. The denial of the necessity of "reconciliation" in the sense in Avhich that term is popularly understood is a denial of something not in the Articles. The Articles nowhere affirm the necessity in the popular sense against which alone I was contending: they only affirm the fact. I have nowhere denied the fact, only the necessity for the fact as popularly interpreted. Every historical fact has been, of course, in one sense necessary; for it has been within the purposes of God: but what I have denied, and what alone I now deny, is that particular moral necessity which is popularly believed, and frequently taught to have arisen from the moral imperfections of our heavenly Father. If 1 am con¬ demned under this charge, it will be equivalent to a judicial declaration by your Lordships that a clergy¬ man of the Church of England is not permitted to vindicate the moral perfection of God.</page><page sequence="11">DOCTRINE OF ATONEMENT. 11 The Eleventh Article of Charge is in part true and in part false. But the true part is not a charge of heresy. I am charged with maintaining— " That there is no need of any atonement or sacrifice, nor any place for such in the purpose of God." The first part of this is true: I have affirmed that there is no need of any atonement or sacrifice, but the Articles nowhere affirm the contrary. Therefore there is no heresy in the statement. The second part is not true, because I have never used the expression attributed to me, " That there is no place for atonement or sacrifice in the purpose of God." At the same time there is no assertion to the con¬ trary in the Articles of Religion. In Article of Charge xii. I am charged with main¬ taining— " That Christ did not bear the punishment due to our sins, nor suffer in our stead and for us; and that to think that He did, or that it was necessary that He should so suffer is infinitely erroneous and dishonouring to God, and is the most revolting of all the popular beliefs." Of course, I have affirmed that Christ did not bear the punishment due to our sins, but not one of the Articles of Religion affirms that He did. Then the words, " nor suffer in our stead and for us" do not occur in any of the incriminated passages. This, if it be a categorical contradiction of the Articles of Religion, is at least one which I have never made. Again, the sentence, "To think that He did so suffer," etc., is a remarkable instance of shuffling. In the Hi</page><page sequence="12">12 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. preceding clause two statements are made, one of which is mine and the other is not mine. Then the next clause ingeniously quotes my words, but refers them to both the preceding statements, one of which I repudiate. Had the charge run thus—" You have maintained that Christ did not bear the punishment due to our sins, and to think that He did, or that it was necessaiy that He should so bear the punishment due to our sins, is infinitely erroneous and dishonouring to God," this would have been true; for 1 have said and maintained all this, because the Articles of Religion nowhere affirm the contrary. But I have not s&amp;idi the latter part in reference to " Christ suffering in our stead and for us." Let us, at all events, have per¬ fect accuracy in the wording of these charges, out of which I have neither the desire nor the skill to shuffle. In Article of Charge xiii. I am charged with main¬ taining— " That the commonly received doctrines of intercession and mediation by Christ, and atonement or reconciliation to God by the death of Christ are all opposed to the per¬ fect harmony and simplicity of the love of God, and to the teaching of Jesus Christ himself." Most assuredly I have maintained this, and further maintain that it is neither heretical nor illegal. The Articles of Religion are not necessarily the expressions of the " commonly received doctrines," about any matter. I have attacked only the com¬ monly received doctrines on these points here enumerated, and will do so again. The Articles of</page><page sequence="13">DOCTRINE OF ATONEMENT. 13 Religion do not forbid me to do so. The Articles might be every one literally and strictly true, and the commonly received doctrines all false, and vice versd. "What I have said is not only true in fact, but legally permissible to a clergyman to affirm if he pleases. It is rather too bold an assumption on the part of the prosecution to expect that, in addition to the restric¬ tions imposed upon us by law, we are going to be tied down likewise to the " commonly received doc¬ trines" of any particular age of the Church's history in which we may happen to live. Before I pass to the second branch of this part of my argument I will sum up my reply to Articles of Charge x., xi., xii., xiii. They charge me partly with saying what I have really said, and partly with having said what I did not say. The former can be shown not to contradict the Articles of Religion, the latter part falls because it is false. What I have really said is not heretical, and what is, or might be, here¬ tical I did not say. I have now to show that what I have denied on this point is not what the Articles of Religion affirm, but certain glosses put upon, or inferences drawn from them, for which the Articles are not responsible. The glosses or inferences to which I refer, and which I have designated as the " commonly received doctrines" of intercession, mediation of Christ, and atonement or reconciliation to God by the death of Christ may be summed up in a few words, viz.:—</page><page sequence="14">14 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. The first person of the Trinity, viz., God the Father, was hostile to men, hated them, and cursed them with an everlasting curse, but was turned from His anger, as regards a certain portion of mankind, by the death of the second person in the Trinity, viz., God the Son, who became a man in order that He might suffer the punishment Avhich God the Father had at first decreed against the whole race of mankind. In consideration of the sufferings and bloodshed of Jesus Christ, the angry and hostile God consented to forego the execution of His curse in the case of all those among men who should comply with certain conditions. God would have nothing to do with any one of our race, who, through non-com¬ pliance with those conditions, was unable or unwilling to avail himself of the contract or bargain made between Him and His Son. He would listen to no prayer, however earnest, that was not offered up through the merits and mediation, and by the intercession of Jesus Christ. He would pardon no sin, remit no penalty, except on the condition of having exacted the full price of it from the sufferings and death of an innocent substitute. God, in many popular theories, is not merely described as being, but is also by many jirmly believed to be, hostile to men, relentless, re¬ vengeful, the very opposite of all that men ascribe to Christ, or to any tender-hearted and strictly just human being. In one breath some popular theo¬ logians tell us that the death of Jesus pacified the wrath of God for every sin and every error that we</page><page sequence="15">DOCTRINE OF ATONEMENT. 15 can commit; in the next they tell us they have made a mistake, and there is one sin which God never will forgive, but which will aggravate the fury of His everiasting wrath a thousandfold—it is the sin of not believing their doctrine of the Atonement. For all who disbelieve it there remains nothing but the hopeless anguish of an Eternal Hell. Such is a brief epitome of the worst form in which the popular theories have been and are still set forth. Tour Lordships will find that all my teaching on these subjects has been aimed against this hideous, this blasphemous picture of the Almighty and All- loving Father, and of His dealings with men. I am well aware—and I acknowledge it with the deepest thankfulness—that these views are becoming rapidly modified, that fewer and fewer of our own clergy set forth such a horrible caricature of the Gospel, and that the work of exposing and denouncing it as I have done is all but complete. Whether the framers of our Articles intended that such inferences should be drawn from the Articles themselves can best be shown by comparing them with the Homilies which were before them, and which the framers of the Articles only recommended as containing a wholesome doctrine, which they undoubtedly do, besides much that is unwholesome. No contrast can be more striking and complete between the language used in the Articles of Religion, in reference to the doctrine of the Atonement, and the language employed in the Homilies—language, I venture to say, which if used</page><page sequence="16">16 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. in more modern times would be designated by all reverent minds as wild and offensive to the last degree. Such a contrast surely should teach us all that, whatever the framers of the Articles of Religion believed, they positively shrank from adopt¬ ing^—still more from imposing on the clergy—such interpretations and expressions of the doctrine of Atonement as were then current. To quote first from the extracts from the Homilies, cited in the Articles of Charge, page 13. Speaking of Christ it is said— " He is that dearly beloved Son, for whose sake God is fully pacified." The Articles of Religion nowhere speak of God being "pacified" at all.—(page 14) :— " God sent His only Son into this world, by shedding of His most precious blood to make a sacrifice, and, as it were, amends to His Father for our sins, to assuage His wrath and indignation conceived against us for the same." Nowhere hi the Articles of Religion do we find any such expression as "assuaging the wrath and indignation of God against men by the shedding of blood," or any thing which can be twisted into any such meaning. Again, the idea of " ransom " and " purchase " is made use of in the Homilies, but finds no place in the Articles of Religion (page 14):— " And although this justification be free unto us, yet it cometh not so freely unto us that there is no ransom paid therefore at all. And whereas it lay not in us that to do, He provided a ransom for us, that was the most</page><page sequence="17">THE HOMILIES ON ATONEMENT. 17 precious body and blood of His own most dear and best beloved Son, Jesus Christ, who besides His ransom ful¬ filled the law for us perfectly." But I must turn now to some Homilies not quoted against me (strange to say) by my prosecutors. The passages which I shall cite contain just that idea of the relation between God and man which I am thankful to have had life and breath to denounce. In the Homilies for Good Friday we read— " Our debt was a great deal too great for us to have paid, and without payment God the Father could never have been at one with us." " Who can now consider the grievous debt of sin, which could none otherwise be paid but by the death of an innocent, and not hate sin?" " If God hated sin so much that He would allow for the redemption thereof only the death of His own only and well-beloved Son, who will not stand in fear thereof ?" " So pleasant was this sacrifice and oblation of His Son's death, which He so obediently and innocently suffered, that He would take it for the only and full amends for all the sins of the world." In the Second Homily for Good Friday we read— " Our great grandfather, Adam, in eating the apple forbidden him in Paradise, purchased thereby not only to himself, but also to his posterity for ever, the just wrath and indignation of God, who condemned both him and all his to everlasting death, both of body and soul." " He became mortal, he lost the favour of God, he was cast out of Paradise, he was no longer a citizen of Heaven, but a firebrand of Hell, and a bonds¬ man of the Devil." " So that neither he nor any of his had any right or interest at all in the kingdom of heaven, but were become plain reprobates and castaways, being perpetually damned to the everlasting pains of hell fire." " We could do nothing that might pacify God's wrath." " These things (offerings) could not put away the anger of God, they could not cool the heat of His wrath." " We had nothing in ourselves whereby we might quench His burning wrath." " Is not sin, think you, B</page><page sequence="18">18 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. a grievous thing in His sight, seeiug for the transgression of God's precepts, in eating of one apple, he condemned all the world to perpetual death, and could not be pacified but with only the blood of His own Son." " That He could be pacified by no other means but only with the sweet and precious blood of His dear Son." " Ought not this to engender extreme hatred of sin to consider that it did violently, as it were, pluck God out of heaven to make him feel the horrors and pains of death?" I ought sincerely to apologise to your Lordships for having read such passages out of any book for your hearing, but it was necessary to do this in order to bring this extremely horrible language into direct contrast with the language of the Articles of Religion on the subject of our reconciliation with God. Article II. states that " Christ truly suffered to reconcile His Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of man." Article XV. " He came to be the Lamb without spot, who by the sacrifice of Himself once made should take away (not the punishment, but) the sins of the world." Article XXXI. " The offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual." No language can be more mild, reverent, and temperate than this. If the Homilies are not mere ex¬ pressions of the "commonly received doctrine" of their time on this subject, why were the leading ideas con¬ veyed in the extracts just read from those Homilies so carefully and studiously avoided by the framers of the Articles of Religion We nowhere find in them the ideas of "ransom," "debt," "payment," "substitution,"</page><page sequence="19">THE HOMLLIES CONTRASTED with the ARTICLES. 19 or " vicarious punishment." Nowhere in the Articles is affirmed God's wrath against sinners, though it is with truth affirmed as against sin. Nowhere is it represented in our Articles that God's wrath " was soothed and pacified by the sweet blood of His dear Son." Even hi the Seventeenth Article which refers to the belief of those times in a doctrine now almost universally rejected, the most gentle and delicate terms are selected to convey the dreadful idea of God choosing some out of a common doom and leaving others to hopeless damnation. The very " curse" spoken of is not called the curse of God, but might be the curse of any other being, or a term only implying shocking misery, the simple misery or curse of sin; while the sentence of pre¬ destination to endless woe is not spoken of affirma¬ tively, but only alluded to as something too terrible, and too mischievous in its effects on the human soul, to be allowed to occupy the thoughts and meditations of men. Without tying myself down to refer to every quoted expression from the Homilies, I openly avow that such teaching about the relation of God to man as is conveyed in those extracts is what I have tried to assail, and what I have really, and I hope success¬ fully, assailed; and I urge that when the contrast between these Homilies and the Articles is clearly perceived, it must be admitted that the framers of the Articles of Religion never could have intended them to carry the horrible doctrines set forth in parts</page><page sequence="20">20 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. of the Homilies, but rather, by studious regard to language, they have tacitly condemned those doctrines as being either excessive in grossness of conception, or altogether erroneous and dishonouring to God. I now proceed to the second group of charges brought against me, which are comprised in Articles of Charge xvii. and xviii., p. 18, based upon extracts from my sermons in Articles xv. and xvi., viz.: A, C, and F, pp. 16 and 17, and those lettered G and H respec¬ tively, p. 4, and that one lettered A in Article vii., p. ^. In Article of Charge xvii. I am charged with hav¬ ing maintained— " That mankind are not by nature born in sin and tho children of God's wrath, and are not separated from God by sin, and under His wrath, or under a curse; and that they are not in danger of endless suffering, nor is there any curse to remove by the shedding of the innocent blood of Christ, and that the doctrine of the fall of man is contrary to the teaching of Jesus Christ." This charge resolves itself into the following pro¬ positions : — " That I have maintained— (1.) "That mankind are not by nature born in sin. (2.) " That mankind are not by nature the children of God's wrath. (3.) " That mankind are not separated from God by sin. (4.) " That mankind are not under God's wrath. (5.) " That mankind are not under a curse. (6.) " That mankind are not in danger of endless suffering. (7.) " That there is no curse to remove by the shedding of the innocent blood of Christ. (8.) " That the doctrine of the fall of man is con¬ trary to the teaching of Jesus Christ."</page><page sequence="21">2nd GROUP—DOCTRINE OF ORIGINAL SIN. 21 Now, out of these eight propositions which form the accusation in Article of Charge xvii., I have affirmed some, but not affirmed others. I have nowhere affirmed the first proposition, " that mankind are not by nature born in sin." I simply deny that I have ever said this, or intended to say or to imply it. I have repeatedly affirmed on the con¬ trary that we are all born with a natural tendency to do as we like instead of obeying God's laws. Neither have I affirmed the eighth proposition, viz., " that the doctrine of the fail of man is contrary to the teaching of Jesus Christ." What I did affirm was that the " commonly received doctrine" about the fall was never taught by Christ, and is " totally at variance with His teaching" (see Sling and Stone, Vol II., Part 1, pp. 7—11 inclusive). That I did say, and now re-affirm it. There is not a word in the four Gospels, or in the Articles and Creeds, to prove the contrary. The remaining six propositions, which I admit are truly charged, I maintain are not heretical. We will take them in order. (2.) " Mankind are not by nature children of God's wrath." Though men are by nature sinful, yet they are God's children, and the objects of His love. To affirm that " men are the children of God's wrath " is not merely to affirm what is not in the Articles of Religion, but to talk pure nonsense. The phrase is never found in the Articles, and is simply absurd.</page><page sequence="22">22 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. (3.) " That mankind are not separated from God by sin." Where is it stated in the Articles of Religion that they are separated This affirmation is not heretical. (4.) " That mankind are not under God's wrath." The Articles of Religion only affirm that the sin of man is the object of God's wrath, and they do not affirm that the persons of sinners are so. What Article affirms that mankind are under God's wrath (5.) " That mankind are not under a curse." Here it must be noted that I have repeatedly and carefully defined what I meant by the word " curse," and, therefore, this statement must be interpreted by my own definition. I urge that in the sense in which I have said it, and which I have carefully defined, it does not clash with a single Article. The Articles of Religion nowhere say that men are under God's curse; they do not even quote the pas¬ sage about " Christ being made a curse for us." They do say that a certain tendency or disposition in us deserves God's wrath, and this I have continually maintained. Even more, I have affirmed that our sinful tendency not only deserves God's wrath, but inevitably and surely meets its due punishment. The wrong tendencies in our own children deserve and bring down the anger of their parents; but are the children, therefore, under their parents' curse Is not the righteous anger of God against evil-doing itself a blessing and not a curse to the evil-doer (6.) "That mankind are not in danger of endless suffering."</page><page sequence="23">DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION. 23 No Article of Religion says that they are in such danger, and if this is not enough, the judgment of this Court, in the Wilson and Fendall case, amply covers this point. (See Ecclesiastical Judgments of the Privy Council, Broderick and Fremantle, page 289) :— " We do not find in the Formularies any such distinct declaration of our Church upon the subject as to require us to condemn as penal the expression of hope by a clergyman that even the ultimate pardon of the wicked, who are condemned at the day of judgment, may be consistent with the will of Almighty God." (7.) " That there is no curse to remove by the shed¬ ding of the innocent blood of Christ." This is equivalent to the statement in No. 5, and is covered by my definition of the word " curse." The Eighteenth Article of Charge accuses me of having maintained:— (1.) " That mankind need no atonement or justifica- tion." (2.) " That salvation is not through justification." (3.) "That the doctrine of justification by faith is contrary to the teaching of Jesus Christ." The first of these three charges I admit and repeat, " That we do not need atonement or justification." None of the Articles of Religion affirm that we do. The word " atonement" does not occur in any autho¬ ritative formulary; I am, therefore, free to hold any view of that which is expressed by the term. I need only add that the "justification" which I say we do not need, and which, indeed, I say is impossible, is the transfer to ourselves of the justness of another. The second proposition, viz., " That salvation is</page><page sequence="24">24 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. not through justification," has not been affirmed by me. I have used no such words, nor, as far as I know, have I mentioned the word " salvation " in connection with "justification." Even if such a statement were heretical, it is not one which I have made. The third of these charges is partly true, but not exactly in words; I have said, " That the doctrine of justification by faith and certain others were never taught by Christ; nor did He ever give any sanction or encouragement to them, that I have been able to discover." I have not said that this doctrine was contrary to Christ's teaching. Now whether Christ did or did not teach the doctrine of justification by faith, the Articles of Religion make no affirmation whatever about Christ having taught that doctrine; and, therefore, whether I am right or wrong as to the matter of fact, my statement does not contradict any Article of Religion. Surely none Avill be so bold as to say that Christ taught the doctrine of the Athanasian Creed Is it, then, a denial of the Athanasian Creed itself to say that Christ did not teach it. I will now briefly state what I have aimed at con¬ tradicting in the sermons cited under the Articles of Charge xvii. and xviii. What I have denied is the theory that Adam was morally perfect, whereas by common consent he is believed to have fallen at the first temptation, as most of his posterity do now.</page><page sequence="25">DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION. 25 I have never denied that God is angry with sin, but have declared my belief that He will and does punish us justly for everything we do amiss, and that His anger and punishment are designed to work for our improvement. I have only denied that God is either excessive or unjust in His anger, and that He is hostile to sinful men. I have understood that, according to the common idea, the " curse of God " means a sentence passed upon Adam and all his race, of endless suffering for inherited as well as for actual guilt. I have denied this with all the earnestness I could summon. I have not denied that sin is a *' cursed" thing, full of mischief and sorrow, and transmitted from father to son; but I have denied that, in our case, born into the world, weak and liable to err as we are, sin deserves to be punished by endless woe. While I have affirmed repeatedly the just anger and just punishment of God, I have denied that He can ever be unjust or unfatherly towards sinners. Surely the omission of the Forty-second Article from the Articles now imposed on the Clergy is enough to prove that the Thirty-nine Articles are on my side in this matter. So far from contradicting the Eleventh Article of Religion, or designing to deprave it, my words in that very sermon quoted against me (C, p. 17, Article of Charge) are these:— " Viewed in relation to the older notions of sacrifice and ceremonial justification, St. Paul's doctrine of jus¬ tification by faith was a great step onward, and as our Article calls it (here I referred to the Eleventh Article</page><page sequence="26">26 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. of Religion), it is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort to those who want it. Moreover, as established in our Articles, it still remains as a strong bulwark against the revived Jewish and Pagan doctrines found in another Church, and actually taught by some of our own clergy. When these tell us that we are reconciled to God by the Sacraments, it is time to quote our venerable Article on ' Justification by faith only,' as the best answer we can give them, as perhaps the only one which they can understand. So these Articles are still 'wholesome' and good, and while people are not set free from the older notions about God, they are also ' very full of comfort.' " This sermon is to be found in Vol. II. of the Sling and Stone, Part II., p. 19. I plead that this second group of charges against me may be rejected by the Court as in part not true, and in wheresoever they are true, what I have said does not contravene the Articles of Religion. I now pass to the third group of charges, viz., those contained in the Articles of Charge, xxiii., xxiv.j xxv., xxvi., xxvii., pp. 28 and 29, based on extracts from my sermons contained in the three preceding Articles, viz., xx., xxi., and xxii., pp. 21—28. In Article of Charge xxiii., I am charged with having affirmed that— " Our Lord Jesus Christ is no more very God of very God, begotten not made, than we men are. and this is alleged to be contrary to the First, Second, Fourth, and Eighth Articles of Religion. 7 O O In this first division of my argument I content myself with simply and emphatically denying that those words are mine. I have never said them. The</page><page sequence="27">3rd GROUP—DOCTRINE OF INCARNATION. 27 only passages of my sermons in which the words " Very God of very God " occur, are the following, which I will read verbatim, in proof of my denial that I have said the words attributed to me in the above charge. (1.) The first of these passages is to be found in the Articles of Charge, xxi., p. 26, par. H. My words are these:— " If that one man who came was very God of very God, in a sense in which all other men are not, His going away again, after a short human lifetime, proves that absence still more painfully." Now in this passage the only assertion at all is that something, if true, proves the absence of God. I have made no affirmation whatever with regard to the " man who came being very God of very God in a sense in which all other men are not." This occurs in a merely hypothetical clause, and contains no affirmation. No one has any right to add any in¬ ferences to my words unless the inferences are neces¬ sary to complete the sense. (2.) The second of these passages is to be found in Articles of Charge xxi., p. 25, par. E. My words are:— " Out of that mystical marriage has come as offspring the human family, a race of beings noble even as animals, but surpassing all we know of created life in being born of God—very God of very God, begotten not made—a statement as true of us all as of Him who was called the ' first-born among many brethren,' and who quoted, in proof of His own Sonship, those ancient words, ' I said, Ye are Gods, and ye ai-e all the children of the Most High.' "</page><page sequence="28">28 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. Here I have made distinct affirmations:— That we men are born of God ("regenerate" as the Church expresses it), very God of very God, begotten not made. That it is as true of us as it is true of Christ; and, That the Scriptures themselves, especially some words of Christ himself, furnish the proofs of what I affirm. But the charge says that I have made a negative statement about Jesus Christ, whereas I have denied nothing whatever about Jesus Christ. And what I have affirmed about men is not even alluded to in the Articles and Creeds, much less denied therein. Unless my prosecutors are at liberty to add what they please either to the Articles of Religion or to my words, they cannot with reason and truth declare that in this case they are contradictory of each other. Moreover, if I have taught any new doctrine, Par¬ liament, the Legislature of the Church, is alone com¬ petent to declare it to be heretical or otherwise. A court of law cannot pronounce as to any doctrine of which no mention is made in the Articles and Creeds. This should especially be borne in mind in con¬ sidering this group of charges. In Article of Charge xxiv., I am charged with having affirmed— (1.) " That the worship of Christ is idolatry. (2.) " That the worship of Christ is inconsistent with the worship of the true God. (3.) " That the worship of Christ is an instance of holding up our hands to a strange God.</page><page sequence="29">IDOLATROUS WORSHIP OF CHRIST. 29 (4.) " That the worship of Christ outrivals the worship of the one true God. (5.) " That the worship of Christ draws away our highest homage and affection from God to another." Keeping strictly to the letter of the law on this subject for the present, and supposing that everyone of these charges were correctly draAvn, Avhere are the Articles of Religion which any one of these pro¬ positions contradicts The phrase " worship of Christ," whatever it may mean in my sermons, does not occur once in all the Articles and Creeds. The word " worship," as applied to any of the Divine persons of the Trinity, only occurs twice, and that in the Creeds. In the Nicene Creed there is the expression (speaking of the Holy Ghost) " Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified," a statement which is made either as a doctrine or as a matter of fact. If it is made as a doctrine, it means " Who with the Father and the Son together ought to be worshipped and glorified." In this case not one of the proposi¬ tions in the charge we are considering denies the Nicene statement about the Holy Ghost. Again, if the words are taken as expressing a matter of fact, id est, that the Holy Ghost is actually worshipped together with the Father and the Son, I have not disputed that fact at all. The other case in which the word " worship" occurs is in the Athanasian Creed, and there the sense is manifestly doctrinal. " The Catholic faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity, and. Trinity m</page><page sequence="30">30 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. in Unity." Whatever this may mean, and whether it be true or false, the propositions in this Charge (Articles of Charge, xxiv.) do not contradict it at all. On the contrary, they are manifestly in harmony with the Athanasian and Nicene Creeds. As I shall pre¬ sently show, the practice of Christians which I have attacked is actually condemned by these clauses of the Creeds, which are therefore distinctly on my side in this case. The only two passages, 1 repeat, in all the Articles and Creeds, which mention the worship of the Divine Being or Beings, bear me out in an accu¬ sation of heresy against a large section of professed Christians. In my further defence, I must urge that some of these propositions, viz., Nos. 1, 3 and 4, are inferences from my words rather than the express statements which I have made. As, however, the whole sense of these passages turns upon the meaning which I have manifestly and uniformly given to the word " wor¬ ship," and which I shall have presently to state when I come to consider what errors on this point I have attacked, I will not cavil about particular propositions. In Article of Charge xxv. I am charged with having affirmed— " That the very idea of the incarnation of the Son of God takes its rise in unbelief, and springs only out of absolute infidelity." (1.) I must first observe that the prosecutors have in this charge added to what I did say something which I did not say, and which makes all the</page><page sequence="31">DOCTRINE OF INCARNATION AGAIN. 31 difference to the relation of my statement to the Articles and Creeds. My words are " The very idea of incarnation itself" (see Articles of Charge, p. 24, paragraph C), whereas they have added words to mine which made it appear as if I were speaking of one particular incarnation in so many words. They charge me with saying, " The very idea of the Incar¬ nation of the Son of God." " takes its rise in un¬ belief," etc. This I did not say, and therefore am not bound to bring it into comparison with the Articles of Religion. On so important a subject, however, and considering that, in all probability, the prosecution was aimed chiefly at my teaching on this point, I must urge that even if I had said these words imputed to me, I should not then have contradicted any article of religion. None of the Articles or Creeds deny that the idea of the Incarnation of the Son of God takes its rise out of unbelief and springs out of actual infidelity. There is nothing in the whole collection of authorities which that statement contradicts even if I had made it, which I deny. My words are these :— " The very idea of Incarnation itself implies a belief that God does not, nor ever did, dwell in the hearts of all men." These are my words, and they affirm only that the idea of Incarnation implies a certain belief about God. Whether that opinion of mine be true or not is not now the question, but whether or not there is in the Articles and Creeds any statement which my words contradict. If there is one such, let it be produced.</page><page sequence="32">32 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. In Article of Charge xxvi., I am charged with having affirmed— o (1.) "That the expected return of Christ to judge the world takes its rise in unbelief, and springs out of absolute infidelity.'' (2.) "That such expectation is unreasonable." (3.) " That such expectation is opposed to the simpli¬ city of the love of God as a Father." (4.) " That such expectation is calculated to over¬ throw the moral government of God." The first of these propositions is no doubt intended to charge me with teaching contrary to the three Creeds and the Fourth Article of Religion. Whereas, my words as given (Articles of Charge, p. 26, para¬ graph H) distinctly affirm that I was attacking the " prevailing views," and "the common notion," about the coming of a God into the Avorlcl once, and His expected return to judge the world. I will read the passage. " But the fatherhood of God strikes even more deeply at the prevailing views than this. The common notion about the coming of a God into the world once, and his expected return to judge the world, turns entirely upon the belief in an absent God. It takes its rise in un¬ belief. These notions of a God coming to dwell amongst men in human form after thousands of years' absence from them, then departing, after a short life on earth, and not returning for thousands of years more, only spring out of absolute infidelity." In this passage I am attacking only the " prevailing views " and " common notion " about a subject which forms an article in the Creeds, and of those " prevailing views," and of that " common notion " I have affirmed, that they turn entirely upon the belief in an absent</page><page sequence="33">APOSTOLIC EXPECTATION OF CHRIST'S RETURN. 33 God, and take rise in unbelief, and only spring out of absolute infidelity. Here again, I do not even deny the " prevailing views " or the " common notion," whether they are identical with the statements in the Creeds and Articles or not. I only affirm of them something as to their origin, and assert that they imply a belief in an absent God. The Articles of Religion nowhere affirm the contrary. (2.) The second proposition in this charge is not true. I have nowhere affirmed " that the expected return of Christ to judge the world is unreasonable." I have applied the word " irrational" to some pre¬ vailing views and common notions, and I did so advisedly. I applied it to the expectation which prevailed in the generation of and after Christ that He would return very soon, in fact, within the life¬ time of men then living, and reign on earth as a visible King. The only passage in which this word " irrational" occurs is quoted in the Articles of Charge, p. 27, paragraph K., and is as follows:— " The thoughts of men, in our Lord's time, or very soon after, began to turn from this hopeless expectation of the Jew to a still more unreasonable one respecting the return of Jesus Christ. I am quite aware that our Lord is represented as saying things that would encourage His disciples to look for His very speedy return in triumph and glory, and that not even that generation should pass away, till they should see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. I need not waste words in again showing you the error of this belief, and reminding you that the sun has not been darkened, nor the moon turned into</page><page sequence="34">34 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. blood, nor have the stars withdrawn from their shining, that the sign of the Son of Man has not been seen in heaven ; that He has not sent His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, nor has He been seen coming in the clouds with power and great glory; that not only did none of these things come to pass within that generation which is fixed by the thirty-fourth verse, ' Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass until all these things be fulfilled,' but that about'fifty-four generations have lived and died since these predictions were said to have been uttered. There is no alternative beyond this, either that Jesus Christ did not say these words, or that if He said them, He must have been mistaken. I unhesitatingly choose the former of these alternatives, and believe that Jesus Christ never said these words, never intended to foretell anything so irrational, or so calculated to overthrow the moral government of God, as the fulfilment of such a prediction would be." I need not waste the time of the Court in asking for the Articles of Religion or Creed which this contradicts. (3.) The third proposition, that I have affirmed— " That the expected return of Christ to judge the world is opposed to the simplicity of the love of God as a Father," is not true. I have nowhere said so. What I have said like this is expressly directed against the " prevailing views " and " the doctrines of so-called Christianity" (see "Sling and Stone, Vol iv. page 6.") (4.) The fourth proposition is open to a charge of great unfairness, so great, indeed, that it cannot have been intentional on the part of my accusers. They say that I have affirmed— " That the expected return of Christ to judge the world is calculated to overthrow the moral government of God."</page><page sequence="35">ATTACK UPON TRITHEISM. 35 What I have affirmed to be "calculated to overthrow the moral government of God," as your Lordships know from the passage K., p. 27, just read to you, was the false prediction which is attributed to Jesus Christ in the Gospels respecting His coming again to the earth in a visible manner within that generation. If I choose to consider that something which men expected to happen, and which did not happen, was irrational as an expectation, and was calculated, if realised, to overthrow the^ moral government of God, borne out as this opinion of mine is by the course of Providence, which prevented that expectation from being realised, what law of the Church have I broken? What Article of Religion or creed forbids my thinking so and saying so I am only amazed that such an interesting illustration of the mistaken belief of the early Christian Church should be now produced in a court of law, for the purpose of defining the lawful limits of the thought of the nineteenth century. In Article of Charge xxvii. I am charged with having affirmed— (1.) " That the worship of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost is the worship of three Gods. (2.) " That the worship of the Son and Holy Ghost is idolatry. (3.) "That the belief in the Godhead of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, as expressed in the Nicene Creed, weakens and disguises the belief in one God the Father, and obliterates the true name of God," All these propositions are untrue. I have nowhere made any one of these three statements.</page><page sequence="36">36 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. It is only just to myself to point out that in the passage M., p. 28, from which a part of the last of the three propositions has been quoted, my words are these:— " We need not hesitate at the repetition of any creed which makes us say as its first words, ' I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.' Any clause added thereto, which seems to weaken or disguise that first grand utterance, may well be tolerated, for the sake of the cardinal, and central, and most vital principle upon which all the rest is, or is supposed to be, based." Here, whatever clauses in the Creed I might have been referring to in my own mind, first of all let it be noticed, I did not mention any by name, and, therefore, it is my turn to accuse my accusers of singling out clauses in the Nicene Creed which, in their opinion, do weaken and disguise the belief in one God the Father, and obliterate the true name of God. Indeed, they have gone so far as to say that the belief in the Godhead of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, as expressed in the Nicene Creed, does this. To say the least, this is a most remarkable incident in a prosecution for heresy. Next, whatever unspecified clauses of the Nicene Creed I may have had in my own mind at the time of writing this passage, I only said of any or all of such clauses that they might " seem to weaken or disguise the first grand utterance of the Creed." I never said that any clauses really did so, only that they might " seem" to do so. and even then I did not advise their rejection (as Bishops and eminent clergymen have</page><page sequence="37">SERMON ON ANTHROPOMORPHISM. 37 openly advised the rejection of an entire creed), but I said " they might well be tolerated." I will now close the examination of this third group of charges by showing what doctrine or doc¬ trines, or prevailing views, I have assailed under these heads. Under Article of Charge xxiii., in which I am charged with having affirmed — " That our Lord Jesus Christ is no more Very God of Very God than we men are," I must refer your Lordships to the two sermons from which the incriminated passages are taken. (1.) The passage on p. 25, E., is taken from a sermon in the third volume of " The Sling and Stone" entitled "Anthropomorphism," p. 47. This sermon is on a text from James i. 18—" Of His own will begat He us with the Word of Truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures." I have simply taken that text and unfolded its plain unvarnished sense, affirming only what the text affirms, viz., that we men are begotten of God; and in so far as we are the offspring or children of God, we are "begotten, not made." I have taken great care at the outset, and all through the sermon, to remind my hearers that the whole is mystical and highly figurative; that all Ave can know or say on such subjects is only a figure drawn from conceptions within the actual limits of man's own experience. Under these circumstances, and after this explicit caution, it would seem unfair to fasten upon any</page><page sequence="38">38 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. passage which, taken literally, might be deemed heretical. I must ask leave to read certain extracts from it, to show that I was not herein intending to lay down any dogma at all, much less to contradict any dogma in our Articles and Creeds. The sermon opens with the following passage:— " I am not fond of mysticism, as you know, and, I think, a great deal too much precious time and thought has been spent on mystic studies and interpretations. But, for all that, some of the mystic emblems in the Bible are highly ' profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfected, throughly furnished unto all good works.' Among these I reckon the metaphors used in the Bible about being born again, or born from above, born of God, which help us to understand our relation to God as His dear children, although the expressions used are not literally true, but altogether figurative." At page 49, I go on to say:— " Now, when we use the metaphor ' born of God,' ' begotten of Him,' we are using an anthropomorphism of the highest kind. We are comparing our spiritual birth as children of God with our natural birth from our earthly parents." I go on to dilate on the exceeding nobility and heroism of the true parental character. I give in¬ stances of the different conceptions of God correspond¬ ing with different stages in human morality, till we come to the time when the true fatherly relation and character were recognised as the highest attainment, and the most perfect standard which man had ever reached, and then God was called " Father," just as in an earlier and lower stage He had been called the "Lord of Hosts."</page><page sequence="39">SERMON ON ANTHROPOMORPHISM. 39 I then say, on pages 52 and 53 :— " But though this nobleness of the human relation was at the root of our conception of God as a Father, it is not by any means the sole ground on which it stands. And here I am coming to the main subject of my text, which, as it were, explains the fact of God's Fatheihood, and is, in my opinion, a bit of mysticism worth having and worth thinking about." I then show that though it is still anthropomor¬ phism and the highest form of it, yet there are traces in human experience which carry the idea into higher ground. In pages 53 and 54, which I only refrain from reading through fear of becoming wearisome, I have explained this, marking carefully that there is a distinction between the animal part of man and the divine part, expressly affirming that the bodies of men are begotten by their human parents, and their spiritual part only begotten by God. Then follows the incriminated passage, which has been adduced to prove that 1 said what 1 did not say. I read in the Articles and Creeds that Jesus Christ was " begotten of God, begotten not made, begotten before all worlds," whereby I understand that these expressions refer not to the Body of Christ, which was begotten comparatively late in time, but to the Divine Being who was incarnate in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. I have assumed the truth of these propositions in the Creeds and Articles. My words cannot be taken as a denial of them without nullifying the whole sense of the passage and of the entire sermon. In no case have I ever called in</page><page sequence="40">40 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. question the eternal generation of the Son, or the doctrine of the Logos ; and wherever I have alluded to the Sonship of Jesus to God, it has been to affirm it clearly, or to rest upon the truth of it as a basis for my argument. The whole sense of this passage, I repeat, depends on my assumption that it is true that Jesus was born of God. " Very God of very God, begotten not made." Moreover, I bring forward what Jesus Christ himself said in proof of that assertion, in which He assents to, if He does not actually re-affirm, the statement of the Old Testament, that we are all in a certain sense " gods, and the children of God." The announcement by me of this close relationship of us men to God was designed to meet and to correct the prevailing error as to our wide and almost hopeless separation from God; to meet and correct the false and mischievous theories which make it seem that God is not the Father of men, and that we are not His dear children. It may startle the minds of those who delight in placing barriers between God and men, and in dwell¬ ing perpetually on His hostility towards us. It may even vex them to hear words spoken so destructive of their favourite theories, and so subversive of their priestly tyranny. But in like manner the chief priests and Pharisees of the time of Jesus Christ were startled and vexed most of all when, by his declaration of His own common Sonship to God with the rest of mankind, he broke down the barriers between God</page><page sequence="41">SONSHIP OF MEN TO GOD. 41 and men, and burst through the deadly tyrann}^ of the priestcraft of those times. Were I to re-write this sermon, I should most cer¬ tainly guard against the misconception to which it has actually given rise, as to the view which I take of the difference between Jesus Christ and other men. Of His pre-existence as God in Heaven I have uttered never a word. It had nothing to do with the subject of the sermon. It is absurd to suppose that I recog¬ nise no difference between ourselves and Him, when we are surrounded on every side and in every land by contrasts the most awful between man and man. Let any one call to mind the very best and the very worst man he has ever heard of. No one can question the enormous difference between the conditions of those two men during their lives. If you call one a son of God, you might almost call the other a son of the devil; but if we learn anything at all from the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we learn that these differences, awful though they be, are not differences too vast for the Almighty Love of God to bridge over in time and in the world to come, so that in some instances the " last shall be first, and the first last." And this hope is borne out by those declarations of Scripture, which affirm that God is really our Father, the Father of the soul of the most glorious type of human character, and the Father also of the soul of another as grossly depraved. In no sense did I mean to drag down Jesus Christ to the level of common humanity. I only intended — and my words can bear no other interpretation—to raise</page><page sequence="42">42 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. the hopes of penitent sinners, and to awaken the consciences of the hardened by declaring that God had, by begetting the Divine nature in us all, placed us on that level from which we shall one day rise to the "perfect stature of the fulness of Christ." (2.) In the second sermon, Vol. iv., part i., page 3, entitled " God with us," my object was precisely the same, viz., to affirm God's very nearness to us as our Father, and our relation to Him as His children. This sermon, indeed, contains my " Apologia." It is a brief epitome of my own belief, and establishes the grounds on which I justify my position of attack against prevailing views. Had I ever suspected that it would have been made the subject of legal proceed¬ ings, I should have added to it numberless supports drawn from our own Articles, Creeds, and Liturgy. My assertions in it are based on the most elevating and consoling of all the teaching of the Bible, and are supported by the authority of the teaching of Jesus Christ Himself. And I can only say that if I am con¬ demned, no clergyman of our Church can henceforth teach the doctrine of God's Fatherhood, or repeat the blessed declarations of Jesus to his followers without breaking the law. The notion of the absence of God from the world, of His literal separation from us, and of our separation from Him, is what I have attacked in this discourse, and especially in the incriminated passage (Articles of Charge, p. 26, H). All that can be made out of that passage is this, and nothing but this:—That if Jesus Christ's relationship to God as a</page><page sequence="43">SONSHIP OF MEN TO GOD. 43 son was a different kind of relationship to that in which we stand to God as His sons (which would involve two sorts of Divine nature at least—one in Jesus and another in us), then His coming here and going away again, after a short human lifetime, proves still more painfully than ever the absence of God. But if we are the sons of God too, as Jesus said we were, then the coming and going of Jesus does not destroy our belief in the constant presence of God with us. The word " sense " used in this passage I honestly affirm referred only to the meaning of the words "Father" and "Son;" i.e., I intended to im¬ ply that the Divine Fatherhood is one and the same fatherhood wherever that term is applied; just as I believe literally those words of Jesus to His disciples, without any subterfuge or concealed change of mean¬ ing, in the two phrases " My Father," and " Your Father," " My God," and " Your God." It must be manifest to any candid mind that I was not intending for a moment to deny that Jesus was " Very God of Very God," nor can my words bear that meaning. They only can mean what they were intended to mean, viz.:—that the relationship of ourselves to God as His sons is the same relationship as that of Jesus to God as His Son. To me it appears that the manifestation of Jesus Christ on the earth was designed to bring men to God, to make them believe in His intimate nearness and tender relationship as our Father. No doubt in the earliest times it had this effect, as we see in the Epistles of SS. Paul, James, Peter, and John. But, as a matter</page><page sequence="44">44 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. of fact, it has lost this charm; and what was once the greatest help to the human mind in its search after God has become, through restriction and perversion, a greater barrier than ever; and those who are under its strongest influences are growing more and more distant from God, and more and more under the necessity of resorting to multiplied intercessors, mediators, and sacrificial rites. Surely he is the best. preacher of the Gospel, and the truest apostle of Christ, who takes up His very words of comfort, and peace, and hope, and does his best to accomplish for his own times and people what Jesus Christ did for His. With such battalions of texts behind me, it needed but small courage to repeat the convictions of the Founder of our Religion, and of His early followers. If Christ and His Father were one, so are we declared " to be one with them, even as they are one," and to have fellowship with the Father, to have grown by faith and love out of the infancy of mere children into the manhood of sonship. Speaking of Jesus in glory, and in the most intimate union with God— even "in the bosom of the Father," St. John declares " As He is so are we in this world." (1 John iv. 17.) No language of mine has ever surpassed in clearness and force such utterances as these. I pass on to state what I have really attacked on the subject contained in the Twenty-fourth Article of Charge. I have already said that the whole meaning of my remarks on true worship and on idolatry depends on the sense in which I have used the word " worship."</page><page sequence="45">IDOLATROUS WORSHIP OF JESUS. 45 I distinctly deny that I intended to refer at all to the forms of worship in the Book of Common Prayer, because those forms are on my side, and bear me out in my accusations of idolatry against many professing Christians. My mind was occupied only and exclusively with what I must describe as an idolatrous mode of regarding Jesus not merely as the supreme and only God, but as altogether a contrast in spirit and in His regard for men to God the Father. Jesus is often trusted and loved as the Friend of sinners, while the Father is neither trusted nor loved, but if ever thought upon at all, He is regarded as a hostile power from whom Jesus has rescued them. Moreover, this heart-worship of Jesus is centred on that human personality of Jesus which is denied by scientific theologians, and among these more particularly by Canon Liddon in his Bampton Lectures, and confessedly it has its origin in the idea, that because Jesus is a man, He can feel for and sympathise with men in all their sins and soitoavs; but this, it is thought, God cannot do, because He is only God. The idolatrous element is, therefore, to be found in the homage paid to the manhood of Jesus, as touching which our Athanasian Creed affirms Him to be " inferior to the Father;" and in the implied degradation of the Father's love by contrast¬ ing the love of Christ for sinners with the Father's inexorable wrath against them. While the Prayer Book leads us in by* far the greatest number of our prayers and praises to address God the Father (according to the usage of Scripture</page><page sequence="46">46 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. and the example of Jesus himself), the hymns of to¬ day ignore the Father to an immensely greater degree, and fix the heart's trust and devotion on Jesus alone. Those of whom I complain are in reality Tritheists— the dividers of the Persons. To repeat here what I said in the Court below, modern Christians do not at all object to teach their little infant children, " It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God;" while one and all would be horror-struck at the new version of it, " It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of Jesus." I am sure I need say no more on this point: That single instance expresses volumes in illustration of that heresy and idolatry against which I have, in these incriminated passages, protested. But I might ask, What would any thoughtful man feel as a preacher of the Christian Faith, and as a servant of Jesus Christ, when the reputed words of Jesus seized his mind, and made him perceive their actual import? When Christ declares " Believe Me the hour cometh, yea, is now come, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship Him"—Would an honest man in his right mind infer from this that Jesus was foretelling that the true worshippers should henceforth worship only Himself? Would an honest man in his right mind read those words of Jesus, and then paraphrase them thus:—" The hour cometh, yea, is now come, when the true worshippers shall worship three Gods as one God, and one God as if He were three?" I have done here as my Church bid me do,</page><page sequence="47">AGAINST THE NOTION OF AN ABSENT GOD. 47 and as I vowed I would do, " the Lord being my helper;" " I have instructed out of the Holy Scriptures the people committed to my charge." Jesus Christ surely came to reconcile us to the Father, to bring us to God, to make us feel at home, so to speak, in our Father's presence, and to teach us to trust Him unreservedly as our Best Friend. Either He came for this purpose or He did not. If He did not, then all the Gospel is a lie. If He did, then to the best of my poor capacity I will follow in His steps, and repeat His words of hope and conso¬ lation, and, like the Apostle who was an ambassador for Christ, I will pray my brethren, " in Christ's stead, as though God did beseech them by me—Be ye reconciled to God." To be condemned for doing this is to me neither shame nor loss! In the passages referred to in Article of Charge xxv., my teaching was framed to the same end. I find everywhere that estrangement from God in the minds of men, which makes them either try to forget Him, or be terribly afraid of Him They have, as it were, shut Him out from this human world of ours, and soothed their alarm by persuading themselves that He dwells afar off, and occasionally sends some one—a God or an angel—to visit them. This was the idea present to my mind when I said " The very idea of incarnation itself, which means Deity coming from heaven and dwelling in an individual man for some years implies a belief that God does not nor ever did dwell in the hearts of all men." I have shown that this idea of incarnation is not peculiar to any of the lead-</page><page sequence="48">48 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. ing religions of the world, but is common to all of them, the earliest of which, under the name Brahman- ism, which flourished ages before the days assigned to Abraham, had ten Avatars or incarnations of Vishhnu, who is named as the second person of one of the Indian Trinities. Even Buddhism, which is, so to speak, the Protestantism of the Brahmanic faith, soon degenerated into the same error as that which implies a belief in an absent God. Just as the doctrine of a Trinity always degenerates into Tritheism, so the doctrine of incar¬ nation degenerates into a conviction that God is absent from the world. It is impossible to read throughout the sermons which are incriminated, without perceiving that the great point of attack—I might say the only point of attack—is not one of the Articles of the Christian faith, but the belief that God is absent from the world, and does not dwell in the hearts of men to draw them into obedience and to give them hope. The incarnation of God in Christ has, I think, been falsely taken to mean that God is generally absent. To the world at large God is a God afar off, and all my attack was directed against this idea. Possibly my language was somewhat indefinite, but my meaning about the " very idea of incarnation itself" is strictly true in fact, because the popular idea of incarnation is based on the assumption that God is absent from us, and never, as it were, personally helps us. Still, it ought not to be forgotten that the mere tracing of a popular idea to its probable source does in no sense</page><page sequence="49">AGAINST THE NOTION OF AN ABSENT GOD. 49 touch the question of fact as to the incarnation of Christ, or of any other being. My accusers even might say that the Second Person became incarnate on account of this identical false belief about the absence of God; that in pity for our unbelief God sent His Son to enlighten us as to His constant presence. Your Lordships must be quite aware by this time that in regard to the incarnation of God in Christ I have never said anything except in affirmation of it. I have taken up and used it as an accepted fact, in order to base upon it certain reasonings about the rest of mankind. I have not contradicted myself that I am aware of. My language has only been in some places more clear and definite than in others. As e.g., when I speak of instances of " isolated" incarna¬ tion I am then referring to the implied denial that God is ever near to men and dwells in the hearts of His children. To suppose that God was only on earth and near to men during the thirty-three years of the life of Jesus is rank infidelity, and in saying so I am not contradicting a single statement in our Articles and Creeds. The theorists, whose views I have attacked, might have learned better than this from their own Bible and their own Prayer-book. It is the denial that God is with men that 1 have really assailed, and not the doctrine that God was in Christ. The same may be said of the passages cited in support of Article of Charge xxvi. Whatever leads men to believe that God is absent, I denounce as false. No one can accuse me fairly of attacking any clause in the</page><page sequence="50">50 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. Articles and Creeds, when I am plainly, with repeated emphasis, attacking the false idea of an absent God, or of a God whose moral government is deficient. I have, morever, already shown that I so guarded my language as to make quite definite my reference to the "popular notions" on these subjects, quite apart from the Creeds and Articles. I need say but little on Article of Charge xxvii., because, if I may say so without intentional offence, it is wholly false. While I have endeavoured to set forth the teaching and mind of Christ himself, I have also studiously endeavoured to avoid using language contradictory of the Articles and Creeds. I now proceed to the examination of the fourth group of charges, viz.:—Articles of Charge xxxi., xxxii., xxxiii., xxxiv., pp. 48 and 49, which are founded on extracts from my sermons on pp. 34—48 inclusive. I am herein charged with having affirmed— (1). "In derogation and depraving of Holy Scripture, that revelation of the knowledge of God by means of any book is impossible." (2). " That all true knowledge of God comes directly from the law of God written in men's hearts." (3). "That all knowledge of God comes only from men's own sense of what He requires them to do." (4). "That the only true revelation possible by God to man is through the sense of God's presence," (5). "And is originated in the heart of man inde¬ pendently of God's written word." Now had I said any one or all of these proposi¬ tions, I should not have contradicted a single state¬ ment in the Articles and Creeds. The doctrine of Holy Scripture, laid down in the Sixth Article of .Religion, says not one word against any of these</page><page sequence="51">OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 51 propositions. All that it says of Holy Scripture is that it " Contains all things necessary to salvation, so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that it should be believed, or thought requisite or necessary to salvation.'' And then " Holy Scripture " is affirmed to be co¬ extensive with a list of certain books, some of the names of which are scheduled. Of Clause 1, which charges me with having affirmed, "in derogation and depraving of Holy Scripture, that revelation of the knowledge of God by means of any book is impossible," I shall only say that whatever I have said, I have not said anything "in derogation and depraving of Holy Scripture," because I have been speaking of the sources of human knowledge of God antecedent to the Bible. How did the writers of the Bible get the true knowledge of God, unless it was in the way I have described Moreover, we all know well that the knowledge of the words of the Bible does not constitute per se the true knowledge of God. But this does not derogate from or deprave the Holy Scriptures. Clauses 2 and 3 I admit having said, and I deny that either of them contradicts any Articles of Religion. I couple clauses 4 and 5 together which charge me with having affirmed " That the only true revelation possible by God to man is through the sense of God's presence, and is originated in the heart of man independently of God's written word."</page><page sequence="52">52 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. In these clauses my prosecutors have confounded the word "revelation," which I have used, with the Holy Scriptures, which are loosely called " Revela¬ tion." This term is not applied to them in our Articles and Creeds, and I think not in the Prayer Book. At all events, what I really said like this does not contradict a single passage in the Articles and Creeds. These are my words (see Articles of Charge, p. 38, paragraph F)— " This sense of God's presence, and this entire con¬ fidence in it, coupled with a sense of our own faults, is in my opinion the supreme ideal of religion. It is, of course, pure faith, originated in the heart of man by God, independent of books, churches, priests, and is the only real revelation possible by God to man." That is to say, God can only reveal Himself to man through his heart, or spirit, or soul, through that part of our nature which is capable of faith and love towards Him. Instead of this being heresy, it is strictly in accordance with the tenth Article of Religion which says that " Man cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works to faith and calling upon God. Wherefore, we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God without—(not the Bible, a Church, or a priest, but)—the grace of God by Christ preventing us that we may have a good will and working with us when we have that good will." This is much the same as what I have said, and has no connexion with the Church's doctrine of Holy Scripture. In Article of Charge xxxii. I am charged with having affirmed— " That in God's word written, Holy Scripture, and Holy Writ, there are found manifest palpable and</page><page sequence="53">OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 53 irreconcileable contradictions, and many places which cannot be expounded but so that they be repugnant to others." First, I should never be so blasphemous as to say anything of this kind, of God's word written or un¬ written. I do not know of any collection of writings to which the term " God's word written " literally and exactly applies. Recent decisions have declared that no doctrine about the Holy Scriptures can be fairly based on that term " God's word written," but that it is to be considered merely a loose name for the collective canonical books called the " Holy Scrip¬ tures." To quote from the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Wilson and Fendall (Broderick and Fremantle, p. 286). " The question is, whether in them the Church has affirmed that every part of every book of Scripture was written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and is the Word of God. Certainly this doctrine is not involved in the statement of the Sixth Article that Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation. But inasmuch as it doth so from the revelations of the Holy Spirit, the Bible may well be denominated 'Holy,' and said to be the ' Word of God,' ' God's word written,' or ' Holy Writ,' terms which cannot be affirmed to be clearly predicated of every statement and representation contained in every part of the Old and New Testament. " The framers of the Articles have not used the word ' inspiration' as applied to the Holy Scriptures ; nor have they laid down anything as to the nature, extent, or limits of that operation of the Holy Spirit. " The caution of the framers of our Articles forbids our treating their language as implying more than is expressed; nor are we warranted in ascribing to them conclusions expressed in new forms of words involving minute and subtle matters of controversy. " After an anxious consideration of the subject we find ourselves unable to say that the passages extracted from Mr. Wilson's essay, and which form the subject of</page><page sequence="54">54 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. this Article of Charge, are contradicted by or plainly inconsistent with the Articles or formularies to which the Charge refers, and which alone we are at liberty to consider." One of the passages in Mr. Wilson's Essay on which this judgment was pronounced, alleged that " there was a dark crust of human passion and error over parts of the Bible." What can my accusers mean by endeavouring to re-open this already settled question Under the shelter of that decision I have affirmed and do now repeat, with all my heart and earnestness that some parts of the Bible are not true —that " there are in it manifest palpable and irrecon¬ cileable contradictions, and that some places in it cannot be expounded but so that they be repugnant to others." I will not trespass on the time of the Court by quoting illustrations of these errors and contradictions. I need only challenge my accusers to produce a single passage out of all the Articles and Creeds which forbids my saying so. It is true that the 20th Article of Religion has been quoted against me by the prosecution; but what does that Article say, and on what subject does it profess to treat? It is entitled "On the Authority of the Church," and declares that "it is not lawful for the Church to expound one place of Scripture so that it be repugnant to another." I have nowhere declared that it is lawful for the Church to do so. At all events this clause has no bearing on my case. Its meaning is obviously this. The power of the Church is limited to the exposition of the Divine Revelation in the Bible ; and in order to discover what the teaching</page><page sequence="55">OF HOLY SCRIPTURE—FOURTH GOSPEL. 55 of the Bible is upon any given subject, it must take a comprehensive view; it must not wrest one passage into a doctrine to the exclusion of or in contradiction to another. The Article does not say there are no contradictions in the Bible. Its object is to define the extent of the legislative power of the Church, i.e., its rightful power as distinguished from its actual legal power. The Article is in fact a solemn warning to the Legislature of the Church as to the right way of exercising their lawful power ; and it cannot, without the most violent abuse of language, be perverted into a declara¬ tion that no private person is to say that particular passages of Scripture are contradictory. I am cer¬ tainly not the Church. I pass on to the Article of Charge xxxiii., wherein I am charged with having affirmed— (1.) " That the authority of the Gospel according to St. John is doubtful." (2.) " That the said Gospel ought not to be applied to establish any doctrine." (3.) " That whole chapters of the said Gospel are crowded with passages which represent Jesus Christ as speaking words which he never could have spoken, and which, if spoken, would not have been believed." In answer to the first of these propositions I con¬ tent myself with denying that I have made this state¬ ment. I have, nowhere affirmed " that the authority of the Gospel according to St. John is doubtful." But as the framing of this Article of Charge is designed to make it appear that I have contravened the Sixth Article of Religion, I must refer to that Article for a moment. Its words are—</page><page sequence="56">56 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. " In the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church." What Church? Does this mean the Church of the first and second centuries? If so, this clause would exclude the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Book • of Revelation, and probably this very Gospel accord¬ ing to St. John, not to mention many more. If that Church be not referred to, but a later one, what becomes of the boasted unity of the Church of Christ? With regard to the New Testament specially, a clause is added to the Sixth Article, which neutralises the passage first quoted— " All the books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive and account them canonical." So do I " receive them all and account them canonical." I have nowhere denied that any book is canonical, or said that it " ought not to be received." Am I guilty of breaking the law when I affirm of one of these books, e.g., the Epistle to the Hebrews or the Book of Revelation, that its authority was at one time doubted by the Church, and that some time elapsed before either of these books was received into the canon? If not, I may say the same of any other book without breaking the law. (2) The second proposition of this charge is not true. I have nowhere affirmed " that the said Gospel ought not to be applied to establish any doctrine." So far from that, some of my strongest attacks on what I believe to be error have been based on words attributed to Christ by the author of this Gospel.</page><page sequence="57">THE FOURTH GOSPEL. 57 (3) The third proposition charges me with having affirmed that— " Whole chapters of the said Gospel are crowded with passages which represent Jesus Christ as speaking words which He never could have spoken, and which, if spoken, would not have been believed." I admit this without reserve, and I also affirm and maintain that I have a legal right to say so even of whole chapters, so long as I did not reject a whole book or call it uncanonical. Legislation alone can erect my Avords on this subject into an ecclesiastical offence. The thirty-fourth and last Article of Charge accuses me with having affirmed— (1.) " That the said Gospel according to St. John contains passages which can only be expounded so that they be repugnant to each other, or to other places of God's Word written, or Holy Scripture." (2.) " That the character of our Lord Jesus Christ, as set forth in the said Gospel, is quite irreconcileable with the idea of His being a true teacher sent from God, and is entirely different from the character of the Christ of the other three Gospels." I admit having said the first of these propositions in effect, though not in these exact words. I make the admission, however, well knowing that the state¬ ment contradicts no Article or Creed of our Church. (2) The second of these is incorrectly drawn, in plain language it is not true. It should have stood thus:—" That the character of our Lord Jesus Christ, as set forth in parts of the said Gospel is quite irrecon¬ cileable," etc. This amended proposition is true, and I have full legal right to assert it. I have now, in accordance with the scheme of this</page><page sequence="58">58 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. Appeal, to show what I have asserted or denied under this fourth group of Charges. I need say but very little on any of these last Articles of Charge, except on the first of them, which requires some explanation. I yield to no one in my reverence for what is true in the Bible, and I can quote over and over again, even from the incriminated passages, without going to my complete sermons, statements by the dozen which imply and express that reverence. When I speak of "revelation," or the "only reve¬ lation possible by God to man," I am speaking of a well-known fact in human experience, viz., that the only absolute point of contact between God and man is man's spiritual nature; his soul, or heart, or con¬ science, or whatever we like to call that spiritual faculty by which alone spiritual things are discerned. As Jesus Christ said to Peter, " Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (Matt. xvi. 17). I say again, no books, however sacred or venerable, can be a substitute for this communion of God with a human soul. Nay, how could human fingers have ever written down the words of Divine truth which the Bible contains, unless there had been first a revelation of that truth to human souls by God's direct action upon them. In those passages of my sermon cited in support of this charge, I am not attempting or desiring to deprave or derogate from the value of the Bible, but endeavouring to explain, first, how the truth came to be taught and written; and, next, how needful it is</page><page sequence="59">ON REVELATION. 59 in every case to have the same Divine action upon our own souls, in order to make any truth manifest to us, really valuable, and of practical benefit. I must here quote a portion of the sermon on "Anthropomorphism," in vol. iii. of " The Sling and Stone" pp. 48, 49:— " Whatever God is in Himself, whatever be the mode of His own existence, we have no possibility of dis¬ covering, except through the reflections of our own nature. All our knowledge of Him must be limited to our own actual experience as men. Whatever lies beyond that is only in the region of pure fancy, and its truth or falsehood cannot be proved. The very Bible itself, however true, noble, and divine a revelation of God it may unfold, does not, and cannot, surpass these limits. The very best which it says of God is still only a reflection of the best thoughts and aspirations of men; not on that account less true or less inspired by God, but we do not admit that it contains anything that trans¬ cends human thoughts and human understanding." And in the sermon cited in the Articles of Charge, p. 34, paragraph A., my object was simply to show how all true knowledge of God at first arose, before there was any Bible, and how it grew by the cultiva¬ tion of virtue; that the better a man behaved to his brother-man the more he knew of God, and the higher were his conceptions of Deity; that even the Bible itself, with all its truth and- beauty, is powerless to give a true knowledge of God, unless the springs of that knowledge are first awakened in the soul itself by high moral purposes and earnest endeavours to do God's will. To quote again the words of Jesus Christ Himself—" If any man wishes to do the will of God, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be</page><page sequence="60">60 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. of God, or whether I speak of myself" (John vii. 17). Without wishing to say anything disrespectful, I must say it seems to me quite absurd to take all or any of my teaching on this head as an attempt to de¬ prave or derogate from the Bible. I have only taught in detail the substance of the teaching of Jesus Christ Himself in the passage just quoted. There surely could not be a greater stimulus to holy living than to be thus assured that it will be rewarded by enlarged and elevated conceptions of God, and at the same time to know that these higher conceptions of God will in turn quicken our aspirations and endeavours after His perfection. It is only so that we become able to understand those noblest thoughts of God which have been enshrined in the Bible, and which we cannot admire, or even discern, until we become worthy of the discovery by improvement in our lives. The remaining clauses I need not dwell upon further, as I feel quite confident that the judgment of your Lordships in the Essays and Reviews' cases entirely covers all that I have advanced. That judgment authorises me to say that the highest Court in the land has decided that it is not the law of the Church of England that the whole Bible is absolutely true and perfectly good. Where and how can we possibly draw the line for legal purposes, except by specific enumeration of parts which may, and parts which may not, be criticised? For legal purposes, three positions only are possible. The law might be that the whole of a specified copy is true and good. It might declare that specified parts are true and</page><page sequence="61">EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF CHARGE. 61 good, and the rest open to criticism; or it might declare that the whole is open to criticism. It is impossible to suggest any other legal position upon the subject. Now the Privy Council has held that the law of England does not impose the first of these obligations on the clergy. Notoriously, it has not imposed the second; for, if it has, let the scheduled Bible be produced. Therefore the third position must be, and is, the law of England. I cannot but hope that I have successfully shown that some of the Articles of Charge are not proved by the passages cited as proof, and that the rest which can be so proved are charges of having made statements which do not contravene the Articles and Creeds, and are not, therefore, charges of heresy at all. I submit with confidence' that I have affirmed what the Articles and Creeds do not deny, and have denied what the Articles and Creeds do not affirm.</page><page sequence="62">62 SECOND PART OF APPEAL. PART II. The case then stood over till the 14$. November, when their Lordships gave judgment on the admission of the Articles, and Counsel were heard for the prosecution, after which 1 resumed my Appeal, as follows:— My Loeds, Your Lordships cannot expect me to give a worthy reply to the arguments which have just fallen from the lips of the two ablest advocates at the English bar. All that I can do is to say that those arguments are based on a conception of a clergyman's duty differ¬ ing toto ccelo from my own conception of it. I have remained in the Church, and taught as I have done, solely because I believed that it is a clergyman's duty, as well as his right, to teach openly whatever he believes to be truth, as drawn from the Holy Scrip¬ tures, according to the vows made in ordination, so long as he does not contradict any statement in the Articles and Creeds. In spite of all that has been so ably said, I still believe that I am guiltless of the charge of having said anything illegal, unless a prin¬ ciple entirely new to me should be laid down as to the legal limits of our liberty as clergymen. If I have been all this while under a mistake—if,</page><page sequence="63">SECOND PART OF APPEAL. 63 in fact, it makes no difference in the eyes of the law whether I have contradicted the Articles or not, and if I was bound to give equal prominence and force to every doctrine laid down in the formularies, regard¬ less of my own persuasion of what could be best proved by Holy Scripture—then I should be ready, even without your Lordships' sentence, to retire from a position, the rights and duties of which I had wholly misunderstood. But I cannot yet bring myself to believe that I was mistaken, because of the designedly comprehen¬ sive character of our Articles and Creeds, and because that principle of comprehension has borne its fruit ever since those Articles were ratified, in the multi¬ farious differences of opinion and statement which have ever abounded, and which still abound, among the clergy of our Church. This trial, indeed, is not simply a contest between one member of the Church and another only. It is the battlefield of two great parties, representing on one side most of the earnest traditionalists, and. on the other, most of the not less earnest and religious men, whose thoughts are in harmony with the highest culture of the age, and the latest conclusions of science. It is a mere accident, so to speak, that I have any¬ thing to do with it; much as I may deplore that the cause for which I have hitherto suffered, and for which I am now in peril, has no worthier champion on the present occasion, I cannot forget that I am the mouth-piece of hundreds of my brother clergy¬ men, and of a very large and increasing host of</page><page sequence="64">64 QUOTATIONS IN SUPPORT. laymen. From unmistakeable public indications, and from an enormous mass of private correspondence, accumulated during the last five vears, I have over¬ whelming evidence of the spread of those views which I advocate, and of the increasing interest taken by the clergy and laity of this country in the success of my cause. Occupying, then, this position of perilous importance, I crave the kind attention of the Court to my further arguments, which I will en¬ deavour to make as pertinent and as close to the questions at issue as possible. (1.) Supposing it possible that any one or more of the Articles of Charge should be proved against me, I wish to show that it would be only justice to acquit me on certain broad principles already established in this Court. I now propose to show to your Lordships that on all the doctrines alleged to have been impugned by me, eminent Divines, of unimpeached orthodoxy, have departed from the spirit and sense, and in some cases have contradicted the actual words of the Articles and Creeds. It will, therefore, be necessary for me to bring forward some instances of the kind, and these quotations I will make as brief as possible. Amount of Liberty Already Gained. Wilson's In Page 8 of his defence, the Rev. H. B. Wilson dcfence- says :— " I do not propose to quote authorities in the way of apology or shelter for opinions of disputable orthodoxy."</page><page sequence="65">QUOTATIONS IN SUPPORT. 65 The citations which I shall make are for the purpose of showing that propositions maintained by myself have been urged by other clergymen of the Church of England without let or hindrance, and of claiming the credit of orthodoxy for all whose teaching has not been called into question and condemned by this Court. This, I think, I have a right to do in each individual instance; my right is indefinitely strengthened when the citations show that any given opinion has been held by a considerable number of clergymen who have won good reputation as teachers. The judgment delivered by this Court in the cases of Mr. Wilson and Dr. Williams makes it superfluous to illustrate the various propositions which under that judgment may be lawfully held by clergymen of the Church of England. I am no longer bound to defend myself against any direct charges, or indirect implications, for calling into question the opinion that all persons dying impenitent, or out of the grace of God, are tortured everlastingly in hell; or that every statement in the Bible is to be accepted without question as true in fact or morality, or even in religion; or that none can be saved who have not received the sacrament of baptism; for on all these points it has been expressly declared that the Church of England has laid down no definite law, and that upon these points therefore any opinion may be lawfully held. But it is of importance in my case to show how far this liberty has been carried by men whose names E</page><page sequence="66">Milman. 66 QUOTATIONS—DEAN MILMAN, BISHOP JEUNE. stand highest amongst the Clergy of this or any other age; and I feel that, if I am charged with depraving the Prayer Book, or calling into question particular passages, or even books, of the Old Testament, or the New, I have at once a sufficient defence in the words with which Dean Milman concludes his history of Latin Christianity (vol. vi. p. 447), and in which he asserts his conviction that " the words of Christ, and His words alone, (the primal indefeasible truths of Christianity) shall not pass away,"—a proposition which leaves as unquestionable those words only which shall be proved to have been really uttered by Christ; and not, for instance, those which, concluding the Second Gospel, are now rejected on almost all hands as unhistorical, and which we are free to assert contain statements not to be reckoned among the primal indefeasible truths of Christianity. Alleged Scandals Caused by my Teaching. As an example of the commonly received doctrines which I have attacked, I will cite first the words Bishop Jeune. 0f j)r# Jeune, late Bishop of Peterborough, in a sermon preached at Leicester, about October, 1864, that " the fourth utterance on the cross, the cry of despair, revealed that after man had done his worst, worse remained for Christ to bear. He had fallen into His Father's hands." Lyra Mystica. Again from the " Lyra Mystica," a collection of poems edited by the Rev. Orby Shipley, on the subject of Jael murdering Sisera, and sung in many churches by beneficed Clergymen, we read—</page><page sequence="67">QUOTATIONS—ARCHBISHOP THOMSON. 67 God fires with wrath her gentle eye, And arms with fraud her guileless breast. The Archbishop of York says— Archbishop of 1 J York. " The clouds of God's anger gathered thick over the whole human race : they discharged themselves on Jesus only" (Aids to Faith, 332, in an Essay on the Death of Christ by the present Archbishop of York, who adds) " He came to reconcile men and God, by dying on the Cross for men, and bearing their punishment in their stead" [language not justified by the Articles] ; and further, " So long as we believe that the wrath of God, because of our disobedience, fell in the shape of affliction on Him who had so acted as to please God, the terms in which it may be expressed may be suffered to vary," (ib. p. 351). In attacking such views as these I have been vindi¬ cating the Articles of Religion. It is patent that these terrible views, and the ideas embodied in them, are not imposed on any one by the Articles or Formularies of the Church of England, which nowhere speak of xhe wrath of God as falling upon Jesus, or of His suffering in our stead. But, although he has thus used language inconsistent with, or not warranted by, that of the Articles, the writer of that essay is now Archbishop of York; and I would only ask on what principle the Archbishop is justified in speaking, unless I am to be likewise allowed the liberty which I have claimed in a Church which, I urge, is designed to include the two forms of thought which find expression severally in the Archbishop's words and in mine In contrast with the position of the Archbishop of York, I may cite the words of Dean Jackson, who says:</page><page sequence="68">68 DEAN JACKSON—DR. ARNOLD, " For myself, I must confess, I could never under¬ stand the language of many professed divines who would persuade us that the full vent of God's wrath due unto sin was poured out on his Son. Whatever their meaning be (which I presume is much better than I can gather from their expressions) their manner of speaking (to say no worse) is very improper, and, to me, unpleasant." (Quoted in Tracts for Priests and People, by Rev. J. Llewellyn Davies, No. xiii., p. 6). Treatment of the Bible. On the subject of the treatment of the Bible, cita¬ tions are scarcely necessary after the judgment pro¬ nounced by this Court in the cases of Dr. Williams and Mr. Wilson. But as my prosecutors have strangely endeavoured to re-open this question, I am induced to give some instances of the liberty claimed and exercised by Clergymen of the highest eminence —a freedom which far exceeds that with which I nave criticised certain parts of the Bible. In dealing with the mode in which I have ventured •to criticise the 4th Gospel, I pray your lordships to bear in mind the following extract from the writings of the late Dr. Arnold on another canonical book. He says— Arnold. " I have long thought that the greater part of the Book of Daniel is most certainly a very late work, of the time of the Maccabees ; and the pretended prophecy of the Kings of Greece and Persia, and of the North and South, is mere history, like the poetical prophecies in Virgil and elsewhere." (Arnold's Life, ii. p. 191.) " Cyrus is said, in many commentaries, to be a type of Christ, by which I understand that the language applied to him is hyperbolical and suits properly only Him who is the real deliverer of Israel and conqueror of Babylon. And the passage about the ' Virgin conceiv¬ ing,' etc., has a manifest historical meaning as applied to Isaiah's wife ; the sign being one of time, that within</page><page sequence="69">BISHOP OF LIMERICK—BISHOP THIRL WALL 69 the growth of an infant presentlyto be born, Syria and Israel should be overthrown." (ib., p. 196). The Bishop of Limerick says:— " In interpreting the language of Scripture we pro- Bishop of ceed as we do in every ancient document that has come Limerick, down to us." (Charge, Sept. 29th, 1864.) The Bishop of St. David's says:—• " The Church has not attempted to fence the study of Bishop rH „ _.,r T -.1 Tmrlwall, the Scriptures, either for Clergy or Laity, with any restrictions as to the subject of inquiry, but has rather taught them to consider every kind of information, which throws light on any part of the Sacred Volume, as precious either for present or possible use If the inquiry is to be free, it is impossible consistently to prescribe its results." (Charge 1863, p. 91.) Here the Court adjourned. On the \bth November I resumed my Appeal in the following words:— Before I proceed with the quotations I propose to submit to the Court, I crave leave to make one or two observations on certain points raised by the counsel for the prosecution yesterday, to which I was unable at the moment to reply, but upon which I feel it due to myself to say a few words. I feel that I can make no better reply to the arguments which have been presented to the Court on behalf of the prosecution than that which your Lordships have already heard from me on the preliminary question on Thursday last, and with which, of course, I shall not again trouble the Court. Upon the merits of the case which i</page><page sequence="70">70 REPLY TO COUNSEL. is now before you, your Lordships will give such con¬ sideration as they deserve to those arguments which amounted, in fact, to an amplification of my assertion that I have only affirmed what the Articles and Creeds do not deny and I have denied what they do not affirm. With regard to the question raised whether or not I might be allowed to retract, I can only say this. I have no doubt whatever that certain instances of care¬ lessness of expression may have crept into my ser¬ mons, in spite of all my conscientious efforts to avoid saying anything illegal, and I can assure your Lord¬ ships that my sermons were written and published without the slightest fear of their being made the basis of a prosecution for heresy. But even now admitting that possible carelessness. I have no doubt that those sermons express substantially what I intended to say, and my retraction therefore is out of the question. It may be nothing to this Court how I came to say what I have said, but, whether mistaken or not as to a point of law, I have said every word in obedience to my conscience. When Sir R. Palmer was directing attention to D, page 20, Articles of Charge, he exactly illustrated the main groundwork of my defence. I have all along argued that the errors against which I have been con¬ tending are not the true doctrines of the Church of England, but glosses upon and misrepresentations of them. Sir Roundell Palmer read the passage referred to, and his first remark upon it was that the error there denounced was not to be found in the Articles is*</page><page sequence="71">4 M REPLY TO COUNSEL. 71 of the Church, and he then turned round upon me with the entirely unsupported allegation that this extract was a specimen of the way in which those who write against the Articles of the Church mis¬ represent them. My reply is simply to repeat his first allegation, that what I was attacking in that passage is not in the Articles of the Church at all. When Sir Roundell Palmer was directing the attention of the Court to another extract, (F, p. 20, Articles of Charge), the Archbishop of Canterbury was kind enough to suggest that that extract might have been intended by me to be an attack, not upon the doctrines of the Church of England, but upon those of Calvinism. This sug¬ gestion is, in fact, my defence. It is true not only in reference to this passage, but also to all those in which I have attacked the Calvinistic scheme of redemption. Notwithstanding my disclaimer on Thursday, the learned counsel again urged, under Article 12, that I have said that " Christ did not suffer in our stead or for us." I have never said so, nor intended to say so. I trust I am above the suspicion of trying to unsay here what I have taught in my sermons, and so I deliberately avow my belief in the fact that Christ did suffer for us,—for me, and for all of us; but what I deny is that Christ bore the punishment due to our sins. The word " atonement" does not occur in the Thirty-nine Articles or Formularies, and wherever I have used it I have meant by it only vicarious punishment, which</page><page sequence="72">72 REPLY TO COUNSEL. is an idea wholly foreign to our Articles and Creeds, With regard to the Church's rule about Holy Scrip¬ ture, I think that the Twentieth Article must be interpreted by the Nineteenth, which defines " the Church." " The Church is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of Grod is preached, and the Sacraments are duly administered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same." It ought to be noticed that, so great is my rever¬ ence for our Lord Jesus Christ, that I have sacri¬ ficed certain portions of Holy Scripture in order to vindicate his moral character, just in the same way as I have sacrificed certain portions of Holy Scripture in order to vindicate the moral character of God the Father. It may be that your Lordships will tell me that it is not lawful for me to point out to my congregation those contradictions which I find in the Bible. No word that I have heard in any way attempts to show that those contradictions do not exist there. There they stand to this hour. A falsehood or moral blemish is the same and does the same mischief wherever it be found—worse mischief the higher the authority on which it is delivered. Surely it cannot be wrong in a clergyman to tell his congregation that a falsehood is not true, and that a moral blemish is a positive evil On this your Lordships have been called upon to condemn me because it is alleged that I have gone too far in a path, the commencement of which is avowedly lawful, and in which the point at which it</page><page sequence="73">REPLY TO COUNSEL. 73 becomes unlawful has never been determined. If your Lordships are compelled to yield to this call, I pray, not only on my own account, but for the guidance of many of my brethren, that the Court will lay down some distinct test by which the clergy of the Church of England may ascertain when they are within, and when they go beyond, the limits of per¬ missible criticism. On the subject of the Formularies, instead of a collect or two here and there, as quoted against me by the prosecution, I can produce the vast majority of all our prayers and praises in support of what I have taught. I challenge my prosecutors to produce a single passage from my sermons against the doctrine of the Trinity. I have only attacked Tritheism, which is a corruption of Trinitarianism, and distinctly condemned by the Articles and Creeds. The learned counsel for the prosecution have, both of them, spoken of me in terms of respect for which I cannot but thank them, and have acknowledged the purity of my motives, even while condemning what seem to them departures from the limits of the law. But I must ask your Lordships to distinguish between their accusations against me of actual infringe¬ ment of the law and violations of mere sentiment. The Law imposes upon me certain definite restric¬ tions. Any sentiment, therefore, which would im¬ pose further restrictions will not, of course, influence your decision. I now proceed with my quotations.</page><page sequence="74">74 CHILLINGWORTH, JEREMY TAYLOR, &amp;c. Chillingworth declares— Chillingworth. " For raj part I am certain that God hath given us our reason to discern between truth and falsehood ; and he that makes not this use of it, but believes things he knows not why, I say it is by chance that he believes the truth, and not by choice ; and I cannot but fear that God will not accept this sacrifice of fools."—(Religion of Protestants, p. 133, quoted by Buckle : Hist, of Civil. Longmans, 1867, Vol. I. p. 350.) Jeremy Taylor says— Jeremy " Reason is the judge ; that is, we being the persons Taylor, that are to be persuaded, we must see that we be per¬ suaded reasonably.''—(Liberty of Prophesying, 1687 p. 507.) On the subject of Revelation, my language is amply justified by the plain teaching of many of our most distinguished divines. Thus Bishop Gibson says:— B- " It is universally acknowledged that Revelation itself Gibson. is to stand or fall by the test of reason, or, in other words, according as reason finds the evidences of its coming from God to be or not to be sufficient and con¬ clusive, and the matter of it to contradict or not to contra¬ dict the natural notions which reason gives us of the being and attributes of God."—Second Pastoral Letter, 1730. Dean Prideaux says :— Dean (Hum- " Let what is written in all the books of the New phrey) Pri- Testament be tried by that which is the touchstone of all religions, I mean that religion of nature and reason which God has written in the hearts of everyone of us from the first creation; and if it varies from it in any one particular, if it prescribes any one thing which may in the minutest circumstances thereof be contrary to its righteousness, I will then acknowledge this to be an argument against us, strong enough to overthrow the whole cause, and make all things else that can be said for it totally ineffectual for its support."—Letter to the Deists, 1748. deaux.</page><page sequence="75">TILLOTSON, WARBURTON, AND MARSH. 75 According to Archbishop Tillotson:— " All our reasonings about revelation are necessarily Archbishop gathered by our natural notions about religion, and there- Tillotson. fore he who sincerely desires to do the will of God is not apt to be imposed on by vain pretences of Divine reve¬ lation; but if any doctrine be proposed to him which is pretended to come from God, he measures it by those sure and steady notions which he has of the Divine nature and perfections; he will consider the nature and tendency of it, or whether it be a doctrine according to Godliness, such as is agreeable to the Divine nature and perfections, and tends to make us like unto God. If it be not, though an angel should bring it, he would not receive it."— Sermons, Vol. III., p. 485. In Bishop Warburton's belief:— " The image of God, in which man was at first created, Bishop War- „. lay in the faculty of reason only."— Works, vol. III., burton, p. 620. According to Bishop Marsh (of Peterborough):— " The question whether the books of the New Testa- Bishop Marsh, ment are inspired is not so important as whether they are genuine. The truth of our religion depends upon the latter, and not absolutely upon the former. Had the Deity inspired not a single book of the New Testament, but left the Apostles and Evangelists without any other aid than that of natural abilities, supposing their work to be true, the Christian religion would still re¬ main the true one. It is possible therefore to doubt and deny the Inspiration of the New Testament, and yet be fully persuaded of the truth of the Christian religion."— Translation of Michaelis, Vol. I. p. 72. I have asserted very plainly that there are state¬ ments in the Bible, relating to matters of history or physical science, which either cannot be substan¬ tiated, or are plainly at variance Avith facts. Others,</page><page sequence="76">76 QUOTATIONS—ST. AUGUSTINE, MAURICE. whose orthodoxy has never been called into question, have made the like assertions ; but had my state¬ ments been indefinitely more sweeping than they have been, I should still have come far short of the summary judgment of St. Augustine, who says :— Augustine. " It is a very disgraceful and pernicious thing, and one greatly to be watched against, that any infidel should hear a Christian talking wild nonsense about the earth and the heaven, about the motions, and magnitude, and intervals of the stars, the courses of years and times, the natures of animals, stones, and other matters of the same kind, pretending that he has the authority of the Scriptures on his side. The other, who understands these things from reason or experience, seeing that the Christian is utterly ignorant of the subject, that he is wide of the mark by a whole heaven, cannot refrain from laughter. What pain and sorrow these rash dogma¬ tists cause to their wiser brethren can scarcely be told; who, if they have been convinced of a foolish and false opinion by those who do not acknowledge the authority of our books, straightway produce these same sacred books, in proof of that which they have advanced, with the most light-minded rashness and open falseness ; nay, even quote from memory, many words which they think will help out their case, understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm." (De Genesi ad Literam, i. 39; quoted with approval by Mr. Maurice : Serm. on Old Testament, pp. 14, 15.) What object have I had, or can I have, in speaking of the Bible, but to sweep away from the path of my fellow-men everything which may place a barrier of distrust between themselves and God, which may lead them to doubt His justice, and to question His love? For such action what better justification can I have than the words of Mr. Maurice Maurice. " It is good to shrink from any phrase, yes, though it be a phrase of Scripture, which seems to impugn the</page><page sequence="77">QUOTATIONS—BISHOP THIRL WALL, WHATELY. 77 absolute entire goodness of God ; it is well to determine that we will not suffer such a phrase, let it come with what authority it ivill, to impugn the very ground on which we give it that authority—that we will not let God's book set us at war with God Himself" (ib., p. 171). Bishop Thirlwall also says : — " A great part of the events related in the Old Testa- Bishop Thirl- ment has no more apparent connexion with our religion than those of Greek and Roman history The history, so far as it is a narrative of civil and political transactions, has no essential connexion with any reli¬ gious truth ; and if it had been lost, though we should have been left in ignoranco of much that we should have desired to know, our treasure of Christian doctrine would have remained whole and unimpaired. The numbers, migrations, wars, battles, conquests have nothing in common with the teaching of Christ, with the way of salvation, with the fruits of the Spirit." (Charge, 1862, p. 123.) Archbishop Whately says— " Nor again is there any reason to suppose that any of Whatelj. the Apostles was in such a sense infallible as that he could not teach false doctrine. They were, indeed, so guided by the Spirit as to have the truth clearly revealed to them, so that they always knew it themselves ; but it does not appear that they were compelled always to speak the truth."—Archbishop Whatelv, Cautions for the Times, p. 111. If, then, they were not compelled always to speak the truth, what evidence is there that they were com¬ pelled always to write the truth And if there be no such evidence, then any given passage in the New Testament may convey a falsehood; and a fallible Church may have grounded any given dogma on passages which may express a falsehood.</page><page sequence="78">78 QUOTATIONS—DR. BAYLEE, DR. PUSEY. I have been opposing such statements as those of Dr. Baylee, on the absolute inspiration. and correctness of every statement of Scripture, state¬ ments identical with those which are contemptuously dismissed by St. Augustine. Dr. Baylee insists that— Baylee. "The Bible cannot be less than verbally inspired. Every word, every syllable, every letter is just what it would be, had God spoken from heaven without any human intervention.''—Baylee's Verbal Inspiration,- p. 48. And again— " Every scientific statement is infallibly accurate, all its history and narratives of every kind are without any inaccuracy. The words and phrases have a grammatical and philological accuracy, such as is possessed by no human composition."—Ibid, p. 62. Dr. Pusey says— Pusey. "Even Gerhard employed as an argument for the authenticity of the Hebrew points, that it would other¬ wise follow that Scripture was not delivered by God, through the Prophets, quoad singula verba."—(Inquiry into the Theology of Germany, Part II., p. 71.) The same opinion is virtually upheld by those who agree with Dr. Baylee; and these find a place in the Church of England, their right to which I am in no way inclined to dispute. But why should I be denied the same freedom in another direction, which was once exercised by Dr. Pusey, when he said :— " I had designated it as a supposition pregnant with mischief that any doubt on an individual portion of the sacred volume necessarily implied diminished value of its whole contents. The observation was made in</page><page sequence="79">QUOTATIONS—DR. PUSEY. 79 consequence of a disposition which I have seen in this country, to regard with suspicion and distrust anyone who felt himself compelled to hesitate with regard to the genuineness of any book, or portion of a book, of Scripture (even though it should be one of those about which the ancient Church was divided); to impute wrong motives to those who do so, and to think it a merit rather than a blessing to be free from doubts."— lb., p. 110. No attack upon the authority of the Bible has been made by me so severe as the implication of wilful dis¬ honesty on the part of writers of the Old Testament urged by the present Regius Professor of Hebrew in the University of Oxford. Of the genealogy in St. Matthew's Gospel, Dr. Pusey, addressing the Church Congress at Norwich in October, 1865, said :—• " St. Matthew omitted purposely in one place some names, in others others, and used the word begat of the grandfather, or of the grandfather's grandfather Since then St. Matthew' employed fourteen, not as an actual number, but probably as a symbolical number, we need not say positively that Moses did not in like way employ ten, as it often seems to be used, as a mysterious number, significant of completeness, and the word begat of the grandfather, as St. Matthew did."* And this Dr. Pusey urges in face of the Evangelist's statement, that from Abraham to David, from David to the Captivity, and from the Captivity to Jesus Christ, there are in each case fourteen generations, not more nor less. Dr. Irons in the "Bible and its Interpreters " might be quoted almost entire, on this side. * These words are taken (from the report of the Speech, as circulated at the time in the Guardian and other newspapers. See Appendix A for Dr. Pusey's letter to the Times, and my reply.</page><page sequence="80">80 QUOTATIONS—MR. MAURICE. Maurice. J may turn to a well-known writer of another party, and ask why the same criticism may not be permitted to mc, if an opinion so generally held throughout Christendom as to be regarded as an essential fact of Christianity, and as in one sense the basis of all Christian theology, is swept aside by the plain words of Mr. Maurice, when remarking that, in Genesis, the serpent, a subtle beast of the field, tempted Eve, he adds:— " We are not, because we think ourselves wiser than Moses, to put the Devil in place of the Serpent, and say that a beast must mean a Spirit."—Sermon on Old Testa¬ ment, p. 28. When the Book of Genesis speaks of the deluge as universal, Mr. Maurice says that it was very partial; when the former says that all species were represented in the ark, Mr. Maurice says that some only were sheltered in it; when the Mosaic record maintains that all other men and all other flesh died, Mr. Maurice says that a great many in other parts of the earth may have remained alive. (Letters to a Layman, on the Claims of the Bible and of Science, 18C3). Athanasian Creed. To pass now to the Formularies of our Church; of these I have never spoken with disrespect. Had I done so, I might have sheltered myself under the .wing of Bishop Watson; but I may now ask, with</page><page sequence="81">ARCHBISHOP TAIT—BISHOP THIRLWALL. 81 indefinitely greater force, why that liberty of criticism should be denied to me which is conceded to, or at least exercised by the members of the Ritual Commission in speaking of the Athanasian Creed Of this Creed, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in his Protest, appended to the Report of the Com¬ mission, says, that in his judgment, it would have been a wise course if the Commission had decided that it should not retain its place in the public service of the Church; while of the damnatory clauses, Earl Stanhope asserts that— " However they may be explained to the satisfaction Eari of learned men conversant with the terms of scholastic Stanhope, divinity in the Greek and Latin tongues, it is certain that they are a stumbling-block to common congrega¬ tions, forming a service which is wholly misunderstood by some persons, and in which it is observed that others decline to join." The Bishop of St. David's protests against its compulsory use— " As not only an evil on account of the effect it pro- Bishop Thirl duces on many of the most intelligent and attached mem- wall, bers of our Church, but a ivrong in itself. The important question," he insists, "is, whether those who are offended by the Creed have just and reasonable ground of objection to it. / think they have. It ap¬ pears to me that in adopting such a document, the Church both overstepped the bounds of its rightful authority, and exercised the usurped authority in an uncharitable and mischievous way. It may be pos¬ sible for theologians to show, by technical arguments, that it is a legitimate development of doctrine implicitly contained in Scripture. But this, however fully ad¬ mitted, would not justify the Church in exacting assent to their conclusions under the penalty of eternal perdi¬ tion. This was, in fact, creating a new offence against</page><page sequence="82">82 BISHOP THIRL WALL ON ATHANASIAN CREED. the Divine law, and introducing a new term of salva¬ tion on merely human authority. Looking to the period when this innovation was first imposed on Christians, we may find much excuse for its authors. But viewed in the light of the fundamental principles of a Reformed Church, it appears to me, as forming part of our public services, utterly indefensible." I pray your Lordships to give me the benefit of the same latitude of interpretation as is needed to reconcile these words of the Bishop of St. David's with the language of the Articles. The latter assert that the Athanasian Creed is thoroughly to be received and believed, because it can be proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture; the former maintains that it may be possible by " technical arguments," and by such argu¬ ments only, to show that its propositions are, by implication, and by implication only, contained in the Bible. Instead of the hearty and thorough accept¬ ance required by the Article, the Bishop of St. David's regards the insertion of the Creed in the Prayer Book as an evil in itself, and as the result of the exercise of an usurped authority on the part of the Church. In citing such language I feel that I have adduced virtual justification of all my teaching, but I must strengthen my cause by citing the even stronger protest of the Dean of Westminster', who declares that the parts of the Creed which are at once most emphatic, most clear, and most generally intelligible, are the condemning clauses, which give most offence, and that these clauses</page><page sequence="83">THE DEAN OF WESTMINSTER. 83 attest, in the strongest terms, a doctrine now rejected by the whole civilised world—viz., the certain future perdition of all who deviate from the particular statements of the Creed. Instead of clinging to it as a document established on the certain warranty of Holy Scripture, all that the Dean of Westminster can say for it is that it has a certain " historical value"— "As an exposition of the teaching and manners of Stanley, the Church between the fifth and ninth centuries;" and a "theological value"— " As rectifying certain erroneous statements, and as excluding from the essentials of the Catholic Faith the larger part of modern controversies." Instead of regarding the Creed as in any way a benefit to the Church, he quotes the words of Arch¬ bishop Tillotson :— " The account given of Athanasius's Creed appears Tillotson. to me no wise satisfactory. I wish we were well rid of it." Elsewhere the Dean says— " The elaborate anathemas which were once appended Stanley, to the Nicene Creed, even the fierce denunciations which are still the very bone and marrow of the Athanasian Creed, are, indeed, interesting only as the dreary re¬ cords of a sulphurous flame, which has long ceased to burn in the better heart of Christendom."—Essays on Church and State, p. 10. And in an article by Dean Stanley in the Contem¬ porary Review for August, 1870 (pp. 138, 139), he writes of the Athanasian Creed:— "There is poetic fire in its vitals; there are the ele¬ ments of strophe and antistrophe, chorus and counter- mm</page><page sequence="84">84 THE DEAN OF WESTMINSTER. chorus; but in that case we must forego its claims to be considered as a rigid rule of faith, a literal and formal statement of dogmatic propositions." "To modern readers they (the propositions of this Creed) appear like the designed statement of an inextric¬ able enigma; but that is the modern, not the ancient, thought concerning it." Again (page 3 40) :— " The difference of conception between immensus and ' incomprehensible' indicates the difference between the perfectly comprehensible and intelligible notion of the doctrine of the Trinity as conceived by the author of the Athanasian Creed, and its inscrutable and unfathom¬ able mystery, as conceived, perhaps more justly, by modern theologians." The Dean quotes, with approval, in page 145, a passage from Dr. J. H. Newman's Grammar of Assent:— Newman. " If an ordinary Englishman does attempt to fathom their meaning, he probably understands ' substance ' in the sense of matter, and ' person' in the sense of an individual, and thus is led by the very Creed, which is to preserve him from error, into the two gravest of all heresies with respect to the Godhead, that the Divine nature is corporeal, and that there are three Gods." Again, Dean Stanley says (page 150) :— Stanley. " I* might be questionable whether it was worth while to retain as a public formulary a Creed of which the chief words are understood by the common people in a sense perfectly different from their original intention, and of which the chief champions of the Creed have said (here are quoted the words of Canon Liddon), that they ' ought not to be employed without considerable intellec¬ tual caution,' or that ' nothing at all is known' about their meaning. It becomes most of all questionable when these words, thus ambiguous in themselves, are enforced under anathemas the most terrible and plain that human language admits, and which have now universally ceased in their obvious sense to be believed."</page><page sequence="85">THE DEAN OF WESTMINSTER. 85 Again (page 154) :— " The truths, concerning the unity of God, which Unitarianism teaches, are taught by the Creed with a force and clearness which cannot be mistaken. The truths concerning the distinctions in the Godhead which Trinitarianism teaches are taught by the Creed in words which, as we have seen, have changed their meaning with each succeeding age, and which by those who defend them are accepted only ' with considerable intellectual caution,' or with a reservation that ' nothing at all is known ' of their true meaning. And so it has come to pass that whilst the Athanasian anathema fails to hit those whom its admirers desire it to hit, it strikes with its whole severity those whom they wish to except." Again (page 157):— " It is a Creed without authority—constantly and Stanley, necessarily misunderstood—and involving the Church which continues to enforce it in endless anomalies and contradictions.'' Again (page 161) :— " It is unquestionable, therefore, that, with all the advantages which this Creed may possess, it has been a burden and a scandal far beyond any use which even its most devoted admirers may claim for it." If, then, so far as the Thirty-nine Articles are con¬ cerned, the three Creeds are all placed on the same level, and if one of these Creeds has been thus freely criticised and condemned by clergymen of all ranks, on what principle can I be condemned If, again, the Archbishop of Canterbury and his predecessor, Arch¬ bishop Tillotson—if the Bishop of St. David's and the Dean of Westminster, may thus speak of this document, and yet continue loyal members and ministers of the Church of England, why is the loyalty of another to be impugned if he calls into question certain state-</page><page sequence="86">86 PLEA FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH. ments in the Church Catechism, or other portions of the Prayer Book? I have no wish to restrict the liberty of others. I have no wish to deprive Canon Liddon of a document which he regards as of vital importance to the life of the Church, in spite of the amount of " intellectual caution" needful in using its terms. I plead only for freedom of speech on points which have either been left open questions by Parliament, or which are treated as such by the Arch¬ bishop of Canterbury and a large proportion, perhaps a large majority, of the clergy of the Church of Eng¬ land; and on the ground of this established free¬ dom, I must lay stress on my title to acquittal for the series of charges which have been urged against me. The Resurrection and Ascension. Contradiction of the Articles. I have maintained that my teaching may through¬ out be reconciled with the words of the Thirty-nine Articles: but even if it could be proved that some propositions laid down by myself are incompatible with the language of those formularies, why am I to- be punished, wmen on the cardinal event or miracle of the Ascension we have heard from the lips of a. Bishop, preaching before the University of Cam¬ bridge,1" words which it would seem impossible to reconcile with the wording of the Fourth Article? In a series of sermons, published in 1865, Dr. Perry, Bishop of Melbourne, stated deliberately that—</page><page sequence="87">QUOTATIONS—BISHOP PERRY—MR MAURICE. 87 " Although the Lord ascended as man in that human Bishop Perry, nature which He had assumed, yet we must not suppose that He carried with Him into heaven the same body of flesh and blood wherein He died and rose again, for, as the apostle Paul has expressly declared, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." Yet it must be held that Dr. Perry's words are consistent Avith the statement of the Fourth Article, that Christ at the Resurrection— " Took again His body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of man's nature, wherewith He ascended into heaven, and there sitteth." The Fourth Article speaks of Christ as sitting at God's right hand, and that from thence He shall come again to judge the quick and the dead. Mr. Maurice says— " That the tribunal of Christ is one which is not to be set up for the first time on some distant day, amidst earthly pomp and ceremonial, but that it is one before which we, in our inmost being, are standing now; and that the time will come when we shall know that it is so, and when all which has concealed the Judge from us shall be taken away."—lb., p. 299. Certainly no teaching of mine has contradicted any statements of the Thirty-nine Articles if this does not do so. Mediation. I have been charged with denying Mediation. I have denied it only as identified with the popular notions which impose any third object between the soul of man and God. My meaning is simply that of Dean Stanley :—</page><page sequence="88">DEAN STANLEY. Stanley. " One of these (the Ritualist) leaders has said that the opposition to their system is 'tantamount to a rejec¬ tion of the belief of any medium between the soul and God.' This is probably a true expression of the state of the case. The acceptance or the rejection of this belief is the turning point of the whole controversy. Helps, indeed, assistances innumerable, not only through the Clergy, the Sacraments, and the Bible, but through example, through art, through nature, through science, through history, through poetry, through church, through home, through school, through advice, through love, through friendship, the human soul has always needed, and will always need, in her arduous, ever-retarded, upward flight towards a better world. But the belief in a fixed, external, necessary ' medium between the soul and God' on earth, is exactly that which—if we have rightly read the Psalms of David, the Epistles of Paul, and the Gospel of Christ—if we have learnt any¬ thing from the sufferings and scandals of the Church before the Reformation and since — true Religion is always striving to dispense with, and the more it can be dispensed with, the nearer and higher is the com¬ munion of the human spirit with its Maker and Re¬ deemer."—Essays on Church and State, p. 272. Atonement and Reconciliation. It is true that the Second Article speaks of Christ as reconciling His Father to us; it is true, also, that in my teaching I have on this subject expressed my¬ self in those terms from the Bible in which man is spoken of as being reconciled with God. The incon¬ sistency is simply in appearance. It will not be con¬ tended that the article is intended to contradict the express statements of St. Paul. But for my lan¬ guage generally I may claim the sanction of men whose orthodoxy as clergymen of the Church of</page><page sequence="89">DEAN STANLEY—DR. HUSSEY. 89 England has never been called into question. Dean Stanley says:— Thus " I could read to you passages from the most approved Stanley, divines, expressing in the most pointed and emphatic manner, again and again, that the true mode of stating that doctrine is that man is reconciled to God, and that the object of the sacred interposition was to bring back man to God, and to rescue him from the bondage of sin. That is the view of the Bishop of Natal, and this is the aspect which is expressed most emphatically in a sermon preached at Oxford, and dedicated to a prelate Hussey. of our Church, in these words : ' To the Right Rev. Samuel, Lord-Bishop of Oxford, at whose ordination it was preached, and by whose desire it is now published, this sermon is respectfully dedicated by his lordship's obedient servant, the author.' That author was my respected predecessor in the Chair of Ecclesiastical History, Robert Hussey. I have frequently called at¬ tention publicly to this fact. I have frequently stated that this view of the sacred doctrine of the Atonement was contained in that Sermon. That has never been denied. And this is the sermon that was published at the desire of that distinguished prelate ; it was dedicated to him by his permission, and it contains this doctrine as emphatically, perhaps not quite so clearly, but as em¬ phatically, and as positively as the book of the Bishop of Natal." (Essays on Church and Stale, p. 321.) Substitution and Propitiation. Rev. J. Llewelyn Davies, Rector of Christ Church, St. Marylebone, says:— " In St. John's writings, the Bishop [of Gloucester and Tje«elyn Bristol, now Archbishop of York] quotes and refers to Daues. many passages, and, at the end, he mentions ' the substi¬ tution of Another, who can bear our sins, for us who cannot' as a point which ' comes out with abundant clearness.' But it is difficult to see on which passage the Bishop would rely, as establishing this substitution.</page><page sequence="90">90 REV. J. LLEWELYN DAVTES. That part of the exposition which seems to come nearest to it is where it is said, ' The means [of our redemption] was His laying down His life for us, which should make us ready to lay down our lives for the brethren.' But, surely, this passage is directly opposed to the idea of substitution, ' As Christ laid down His life for us, so ought we to lay down our lives for the brethren.' Who would speak of substitution in the latter clause If we do not find it in this, we have no right to assume it in the former. If it should be said that the word ' propi¬ tiation,' tXatr/xo?, used by St. John, implies that kind of substitution, I answer again—that is to beg the ques¬ tion. It is perfectly arbitrary to attach to the idea of propitiation a theory as to the means by which propitia¬ tion is effected. If the theory is a true one, it must have other proof; the mere mention of propitiation bears no witness to it."—Tracts for Priests and People, No. XIII., p. 15. Having gone through the passages which Bishop (now Archbishop) Thomson cited as proving substi¬ tution, and having shown, or sought to show, that they disprove it, Mr. Davies adds:— " It is well known, and universally admitted that the language of highest authority, concerning the death of Christ, runs very easily, indeed, into the forms against which I am now protesting, and which Mr. Newman Hall so severely characterises as ' heathenism in its most terrible form.' " (lb., p. 24.) And further— " The Bishop of Gloucester [Archbishop of York] complains that the objections offered to the doctrine of a vicarious punishment are the same now as those which have been formerly alleged. This appears to be true. Being thus old, these objections may be regarded as stale and unworthy of any but a cavalier kind of treatment ; or their being at once old and new may be taken as a presumption that they have a vitality sustained by truth.</page><page sequence="91">MR. DAVIP3S—BISHOP BILSON. 91 ' It has been said that a translation of guilt is impossible' because guilt is personal, and that a doctrine, which represents the innocent as punished instead of the guilty, and the guilty as escaping by this punishment, contra¬ dicts the first principles of justice.' (p. 363.) However long ago, and however often, this may have been said, I trust it will never cease to be said, when occasion arises. It sounds ungracious and injurious when the Bishop speaks of' the views of Socinus on the Atone¬ ment being brought forth again ;' but such a taunt is adequately met by the manly reply of Grotius : ' Neque me pudeat consentire Socino, si quando is in veram veteremque sententiam incidit.' Having never read any¬ thing written by Socinus, I am very imperfectly ac¬ quainted with his opinions. But if he urged that guilt is strictly personal, and that there is no justice is punish¬ ing the innocent instead of the guilty, he bore a witness in which he is no less supported by Scripture than by the general conscience of mankind. Those who main¬ tain the contrary have a very heavy responsibility to bear, in that they put a stumblingblock in the way of their brethren, and throw a cloud on that glory of God which shines in the face of Jesus Christ." (lb. 35.) And, finally, he asks :— " Who can hesitate to choose between a belief in these living relations, binding God and men together, and an acceptance of the barren, metaphysical, forensic formula of an acquittal, obtained through a substituted punish¬ ment, which supplies no food to the reason, and only confounds the conscience ?" (Pi)., p. 51.) On this subject Bishop Bilson says:— " The words used generally by the Holy Ghost to ex- Bishop Bilson. press Christ's sufferings import that He gave Himself for us to be the sacrifice, price, and the ransom of our deliverance. All which words hold no wrath conceived against Him, nor vengeance executed on Him; but rather the exceeding love, and favour of God towards Him, as the only sacrifice that God would accept, the only price that God did esteem, the ransom that God would receive for the sin of the world."</page><page sequence="92">92 MR. GARDEN—PROFESSOR MAURICE. Of the sermon in which these words occur, the Rev. F. Garden, Sub-dean of H. M.'s Chapels Royal, remarks that its importance is enhanced by the fact that Bilson— Garden. " Previously communicated their scope to Archbishop Whitgift, who encouraged him to handle the subject as he proposed. They related to Christ's descent into hell, a point then occupying a good deal of attention. Bilson stood up for the hell to which our Lord descended being the Gehenna of the lost, but maintained that He went there in no wise as a sufferer, but as a victor, con¬ quering and despoiling the whole territory. In arguing this he was led to deny that our Lord ever underwent personally the wrath of His Father, or ever suffered the death of the soul. Since Gherard, these propositions, pronounced by Bellarmine a new and hitherto un¬ heard-of heresy, had become favourites among the Puritans, and Bilson's impugnment of them gave rise to a good deal of controversy." (Tracts for Priests and People, 1862, No. XHL, p. 73.) That Mr. Garden agrees on this point with Bishop Bilson, it is the whole object of his paper to show. Justification. Maurice. Speaking on the subject of justification, Professor Maurice, referring to the "broad statements," that Christ is the Lord of Man, that He took the nature of man, that He reconciled man and God by the sacrifice of Himself, that He rose again as the Re¬ deemer of man from death, the grave, and helL asks:— " Does not such language break down moral distinctions which it is our duty to preserve? Does it not practically deny that God approves the just and con¬ demns the wicked ?"—Theological Lectures, 188.</page><page sequence="93">PROFESSOR MAURICE. 93 Insisting that " no one should be weary of answer¬ ing these objections," he adds: — " He must not be in the least grieved, if he should be met at last with the observation, ' What you talk of the redemption of mankind, means nothing at all. It is a mere dogma, or technicality, with which those who are not in contact with the actual world may amuse them¬ selves.' Such words, even though they may be uttered in a very contemptuous tone, would not excite any displeasure in us if our own minds were in a healthy and right state And it is the less excusable to manifest any irritation when we are the subjects of this kind of animadversion, because we know, or ought to know, that this difficulty, in one shape or other, has given occupation to every age of the Christian Church; that it has been no sooner overcome by a mighty effort in one direction than it has re-appeared in another; that it has therefore all the tokens of being a practical human difficulty, and one of so grave a kind, that people have been compelled to seek an explanation of it; and that when they have sought, they have found."—75., p. 189— 190. This distinction between justified and unjustified men has its root clearly in the desire to draw a line between the Church and the world, with the reserva¬ tion or the implication, probably, that the speaker or thinker belongs to the former and not to the latter. Of such attempts, Mr. Maurice says, emphatically:— "It seemed to Protestant divines and laymen just as necessary to invent plans for dividing the faithful from the unbelieving—those who belonged to Christ from those who had no relation to Him—the elect from the reprobate—as it had ever seemed necessary to the Romanist to divide heathens from baptised men, ecclesi¬ astics from the laity, the saint from the ordinary Christian. And, I think, it must be owned that the</page><page sequence="94">94. PROFESSOR MAURICE. effects in each case have been similar. The great moral distinctions, which God's law proclaims, and which the conscience of man affirms, have not been deepened, but obliterated; fictitious maxims and standards have been introduced, which are as unfavourable to the common honesty of daily life, as they are to any higher righteous¬ ness which we should seek as citzens of God's kingdom, as creatures formed in His image. It seems as if faith signified a persuasion that God will not punish us here¬ after for the sins we have committed here, because we have that persuasion; as if some men were accounted righteous, for Christ's sake, it not being the fact that they are righteous." He adds:— " I find it hard even to state these propositions with¬ out being guilty of a kind of profaneuess and a kind of uncharitableness, so shocking do they sound when they are put into plain words, and so wrong is it to suppose that any man holds them in the sense which those words seem to convey. But it is not wrong—it is a great duty—to set them out broadly and nakedly, that those who have dallied with thoughts which are capable of such a construction may shudder, and ask themselves whether this, or anything like this, is their meaning, or, if not, what they do mean."—lb., p. 197. This is precisely what I have done, and in this the example of Mr. Maurice therefore upholds me as having discharged a great duty. The observations of the Dean of Westminster are very important. He says :— Stanley. " There is no article on Inspiration. There is no article on Hell-Fire. But there is an article on the doctrine of Justification by Faith only. On this great article, however, the Judgment has ruled that we must not, or we need not, interpret its language beyond the exact letter of what it lays down. It asserts, so say all the Judges, that we are justified ' for the merits,'—it does not assert that we are justified ' by the transfer of the</page><page sequence="95">DEAN OF WESTMINSTER. 95 merits—of Christ.' We might have thought that no part of the Judgment would have provoked a more determined resistance from the whole Puritanical party in the Church, than this announcement, that no theory of transferred or imputed righteousness is involved in the ' Article of a falling or standing Church.' But here came in the advantage of the union between the two contending parties. To High Churchmen as to Roman Catholics imputed righteousness is a heresy. Their co¬ operation could be secured by their ancient enemies only at the cost of not raising once more this ancient feud. Not entirely without a struggle, but with a struggle so faint as to have left no traces behind, every protest on this point was abandoned Firmly compacted as the popular theology seemed to be on this special point, on none, we are convinced, is it more entirely (to use the sacred phrase) ' ready to wax old and vanish away.'"—Essays on Church and State, 133. Again, the Dean writes:— " It is hardly necessary to say that not only this par- Stanley, tieular theory, but the whole subject to which it relates, is passed over by the ancient Councils and Creeds, as though it did not exist. They simply declare, in the most general terms, that ' Christ lived and died for the salvation of man,' and thus leave the grandest theme of religious thought in its native unadorned impressiveness. We grant that in this question this silence may be accounted for by the fact, that such theories were at that early age unknown. Dionysius of Alexandria and Theodore of Mopsuestia had stirred to its depths the controversy of the Canon and of the authenticity and authorship of the sacred books. Origen had fixed the attention of the whole Christian world on the question of the duration of hell torments. Those opinions, there¬ fore, when tolerated by the Councils, were tolerated de¬ liberately and with open eyes. But the question of ' Imputed Righteousness,' and its correlative contro¬ versies could hardly have been noticed at all till Anselm and Thomas Aquinas began to put into shape</page><page sequence="96">J.H.Nevrman. 96 REV.

NEWMAN IN 1838. the floating scholastic schemes of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and these schemes could not be noticed authoritatively till they had sprung into dogmatic importance, under the disproportionate influence of Luther and Calvin."—Po., p. 139. H The Rev. J. H. Newman, in Lectures on Justifica¬ tion, p. 60, written in 1838, when he was vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford, says— " Justification, as all allow, and as has been assumed throughout, is a state in which we are acceptable and pleasing to God ; as, then, is the mode in which we please God, so is the mode of our justification, Now, it is plain, from St. Paul, that the regenerate please God, not merely by the imputation of Christ's obedience, but by their own obedience; by their obedience, there¬ fore, they are justified. If they were justified only by imputation of Christ's obedience, they could only please Him by that obedience; but so far as they are allowed to please Him by what they are, and what they do, so far may they be said, through his secret grace, to justify themselves." Now the Article says " we are accounted righteous- only for the merits of Jesus Christ." Here, therefore, we have an apparent contradiction, in terms, to the language of the Article. Yet on this point Dr. Newman's orthodoxy has never been questioned. The same writer says:— " That the scheme of salvation should be one of" names and understandings ; that we should be, but said to be just, said to have a righteousness, said to be saved by works; that the great disease of our nature should remain unstaunched; that Adam's old sinfulness should so pervade the regenerate that they can do nothing in itself good and acceptable, even when it is</page><page sequence="97">fl REV.

"Reputed justification was the gift of the law; but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. Away then, with this modern, this private, this arbitrary, this un- Scriptural system, which, promising liberty, conspires against it; which abolishes sacraments, to introduce barren and dead ordinances; and for the real participation of Christ and justification through His Spirit, would, at the very marriage feast, feed us on shells and husks, who hunger and thirst after righteousness—it is a new Gospel,'unless three hundred years stand for eighteen hun¬ dred; and if men are bent on seducing us from the ancient faith, let them provide a more specious error, a more alluring sophism, a more angelic tempter than this."— ib., p. 63. [Yet this was written while the author was under subscription to Article XL, under the old system.] Again, he says— " Strange it is, but such is the opinion of one of the two schools of divinity which have all along been men¬ tioned, that God's calling us righteous implies, not only / that we have not been, but never shall be righteous. Surely it is a strange paradox to say that a thing is not because He says it is; that the solemn averment of the living and true God is inconsistent with the fact averred; that His accepting our obedience is a bar to His making it acceptable, and that the glory of His pro¬ nouncing us righteous lies in His leaving us unrighteous.'» —ib., p. 86. 1 have never said anything so contradictory of the &gt; Articles as the statements herein made would appear to be, and yet they form part of the accepted teaching i of eminent divines.</page><page sequence="98">Canon Lid- don. 98 CANON LIDDON ON THE INCARNATION. The Incarnation. I come now to the connexion of the Incarnation with the doctrine of the Trinity. Of the latter, Canon Liddon says— " The term persons cannot be employed to denote these distinct forms of Being without considerable intel¬ lectual caution." He adds— " When we say that Jesus Christ is God, we mean that in the Man Christ Jesus, the second of these Per¬ sons or Subsistencies, one in Essence with the first and with the Third, vouchsafed to become Incarnate." Or, as he puts it in other words :— ' He robed His higher pre-existent nature, according to which he is very and Eternal God, with a human body and a human soul."—Bampton Lectures, pp. 48 —51. At the same time, he insists that— "The Son of Mary is not a distinct humanperson myste¬ riously linked with the Divine nature of theEternal Word. The person of the Son of Mary is Divine and Eternal. Christ's manhood is not of itself an individual being; it is not a seat and centre of personality; it has no conceivable existence apart from the act of self- incarnation, whereby the Eternal Word called it into being and made it His own. It is a vesture, which He has folded round His person; it is an instrument, through which He places Himself in contact with men, and whereby He acts upon humanity. As the person¬ ality of man resides in the soul, after death has severed soul and body, so the Person of Christ has its eternal seat in his Godhead before His Incarnation.''—lb., pp. 386—388. Thus, according to Canon Liddon, the Personality</page><page sequence="99">CANON LIDDON. 99 of Christ remained always unchanged (as it must necessarily remain unchanged, being the Person¬ ality of God). The human nature which he puts on is, as he expressly says, " a cloak "—a metaphor which scarcely expresses the inseparability spoken of in the 2nd Article, and appears directly contradictory to the 15th.* Whether this doctrine be or be not inconsistent with the general tone and the express assertions of the New Testament, is a point on which I need not enter. I contend only that this scholastic dogma is not pre¬ sent to the minds, whether of the clergy or of the laity generally, who, if they were asked whether Jesus was a human person, would distinctly answer in the affirmative. The general conviction un¬ doubtedly is that He is a human person, while He is also a Divine person; and the reason for this con¬ viction, if called for, would be, that they cannot con¬ ceive of a being made like unto us in all things, sin only except, who has at the same time° neither a human personality nor a human soul; and thus to them Canon Liddon's doctrine would resolve itself into the heresy of the Doceta3, who taught that the outward form of Jesus was a phantom, or an illusion of the senses. The point which I would urge is this—that the clergy generally, in reference to Canon Liddon's * See Appendix B for Canon Liddon's letter to the Times, and my reply.</page><page sequence="100">100 ARCHBISHOP WHATELY. Archbishop Whately. definition, if that view be the only lawful one, are practically heretical. But they, along with Canon Liddon, retain their positions in the Church of England; and I claim the same measure of compre¬ hension for myself. Still more earnestly do I call attention to the state¬ ments of the late Archbishop of Dublin:— " Our Lord takes care to make his disciples under¬ stand that it is not a different Being they are to look for, and who is to be their new Master, but a different Manifestation of the same God—a return of their Master to them under a new character And the apostles accordingly speak of the Lord (that is, Jesus Christ) as being the Spirit The same God, then, who, to the Israelites, was made known only as Creator and Governor (God the Father), was afterwards mani¬ fested to Christians as being also the Redeemer (God the Son), and the Sanctifier (God the Holy Ghost); and He is to be acknowledged by them in this three-fold manifestation, according to our Saviour's injunction, to baptize in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."—Introductory Lessons on the History of Religious Worship (Longmans, 1867) p. 99. Here, then, is a book in which children are taught to regard the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity as three manifestations or phases of one and the same Being, these manifestations being relative to man, and not pointing to any other reality than the eternal existence of the one God, the Maker and Preserver of all things. Thus thinking and teaching, Arch¬ bishop Whately retained his office in the United Church of England and Ireland to the end of his life.</page><page sequence="101">.WHATELY AND WALLIS. 101 The Teinity in Unity:.—Whately and Wallis. But I am bound to refer more particularly to that elaborate statement of his belief which Archbishop Whately makes in his Treatise on Logic; and I would ask the Court to understand me as putting in the whole of the article (xix.) entitled " Person," in Appendix I. to that Treatise, although I will now cite only portions of it. In proof of his conclusion " that the English word ' Person ' was formerly not so strictly confined as now to the sense it bears in common conversation among us," as denoting a numerically distinct substance, Archbishop Whately cites the words of the Rev. John Wallis, the eminent mathematician and divine, who was chosen Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford in 1645, and died in 1703 :— " That which makes these expressions " (respecting Wallis. the Trinity), says Dr. Wallis, " seem harsh to some of these men, is because they have used themselves to fansie that notion only of the word ' Person ' according to what three men are accounted to be three persons— and these three persons to be three men. But he may consider that there is another notion of the word ' Person,' and in common use too, wherein the same man may be said to sustain divers persons, and those persons to be the same man; that is, the same man as sustaining divers capacities. As was said but now of Tully ' Tees Pek- sonas Unus Scstineo ; meant, adversarii, judicis. And then it will seem no more harsh to say, ' The Three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are One God, than to say ' God the Creator, God the Redeemer, and God the Sanctifier, are one God.' It is much the same thing whether of the two forms we use,"—Letters on the Trinity, p. 63, i J</page><page sequence="102">102 MAX MULLER—WHATELY. Taken in this sense, the Articles of the Church of England would be Articles of Peace indeed; and it may safely be said that if this meaning of the word "Person" had been generally borne in mind, the Church would have been spared floods of controversy which have desolated almost every Christian country. Fully aware that this sense put on the word " Person" by Wallis would not find favour with the advocates of popular theology of the nineteenth century, Archbishop Whately expressly asserts that the words of Dr. Wallis may serve— Whately. " r^° correct the notion that the views of the subject here taken are, in our Church, anything novel." Of the patristic language on the subject, Archbishop Whately asserts that it does not employ the word "Person " in the sense now given to it— " Both because Persona never, I believe, bore that sense in pure Latinity, and also because it is evident that, in that sense, 'three Divine Persons' would have been exactly equivalent to ' three Gods,' a meaning which the orthodox always disavowed." " The three persons are the same God, sustaining different capacities or relations." In his opinion, the Fathers employed a term— bo j &gt; " Winch might serve to denote that (though Divine r rl attributes belong to all and each of these, yet) there are attributes of each respectively, which are not so strictly applicable to either of the others as such; as when, for instance, the Son is called especially the Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit the Comforter or Paraclete."</page><page sequence="103">ARCHBISHOP WHATELY. 103 Dr. Whately here remarks that— " English readers are not usually aware that the title of Paraclete is even distinctly applied to Christ in Scrip¬ ture, as it is in 1 John ii. 1, because it is there trans¬ lated ' Advocate,' instead of ' Comforter.' " " The notion thus conveyed," adds Dr. Whately, " is, indeed, very faint and imperfect, but it is, perhaps, for that very reason (considering what man is and what God is) the less likely to lead to error. One may convey to a blind man the notion of seeing, correct, as far as it goes, and instructive to him, though very imperfect; if he form a more full and distinct notion of it, his ideas will inevitably be incorrect." To show still more clearly the nature of the materials employed in these discussions, he notes that— " It is worth observing, as a striking instance of the little reliance to be placed on etymology as a guide to the meaning of a woid, that hypostasis, substantia, and understanding, so widely different in this sense, corre¬ spond in their etymology." The terms, therefore, must, he maintains, be used with great caution ; and he adds:—. " I am persuaded that much heresy, and some infi¬ delity, may be traced in part to the neglect of this cau¬ tion. It is not wonderful that some should be led to renounce a doctrine, which, through the ambiguity in question, may be represented to them as involving a self-contradiction, or as leading to Tritheism; that others should insensibly slide into this very error; or that many more (which I know to be no uncommon- case) should, for fear of that error, deliberately, and on principle, keep the doctrine of the Trinity out of their thoughts."</page><page sequence="104">104 ARCHBISHOP WHATELY. As regards any scientific definitions of the doctrine, he says— " To require explanations of what God is in Himself, is to attempt what is beyond the reach of human faculties, and foreign from the apparent design of Scripture- revelation ; which seems to be chiefly, if not wholly, to declare to us (at least to insist on among the essential articles of faith), with a view to our practical benefit and to the influencing of our feeling and conduct, not so much the intrinsic nature of the Deity, as what He is and does relatively to us. Scripture teaches us (and our Church Catechism directs our attention to these points) to believe in God, who, as the Father, hath made us and all the world—as the Son, hath redeemed us and all mankind—as the Holy Ghost, sanctifieth us and all the elect people of God." According to Archbishop Whately, then, the one fact predicated of the Godhead is the existence of the One living and true God, together with certain attributes of the same one Being, to which Christian theology has given, in their relation to us, the names of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. It is unnecessary to point out how completely this view runs counter to the generally received belief on the subject; and yet Dr. Whately, after thus expressing himself, lived and died Arch¬ bishop of Dublin. Having thus swept aside the dominant opinions of Christendom, Archbishop Whately concludes with the assertion:— " The views I have taken derive confirmation, now that they have been so long before the public, from the</page><page sequence="105">ARCHBISHOP WHATELY—DR. SHERLOCK. 105 total absence (to the best of my knowledge) of all attempts at refutation, especially when considered in conjunction with the strong objection to them which is felt by some—e.g., I have seen in an argumentative work a warning given to the reader against this very Article (by name) as containing very erroneous doctrine, of which, however, no refutation at all is subjoined; which one cannot but suppose any writer would have done who had ever thought of or heard of any, even plausible arguments against the doctrines censured.'' I claim, therefore, with Archbishop Whately, for my teaching generally, not only the mere sanction of Scripture, but the full legal sanction of the Articles, which I maintain to be on my side much more than on that of my prosecutors. The difficulty of reconciling the several proposi¬ tions of the XXXIX Articles, or rather the danger which attends such attempts, may be further illus¬ trated by the words of the Bishop of Ossory, who, taking his stand on the words of Christ in the Synoptic Gospels, says, in his charge, 1863, p. ] 10:— " I am sure that what He says is true, and while it Bp. O'Brien makes it certain that there was one thing which He did of Ossory. not know, it makes it possible that there were other things also which He did not know." To the explanation " That while the day and the hour of the coming of the Son of Man were, of course, known to Him in His Divine Nature, they were unknown to Him in His Human Nature," he replies that it " Seems to be open to insurmountable objections. i We are in reality, though not in words, supposing Him I to be made up of two persons."—Charge 1863, p. 103.</page><page sequence="106">106 BISHOP OF OSSORY. The " Gospels/' Bishop O'Brien asserts, " Testify directly to the fact that the state of the Son in the flesh was one of absolute and entire dependence upon the Father, both for divine knowledge and divine power;" or, in other words, that during his sojourn upon earth, the Son was " Emptied of His Divine Glory, of His Divine Power, and of His Divine Omniscience."—Charge, pp. 106, 109. To make his meaning still clearer, he adds:— " All things, doubtless, were known to the Son when He was in the form of God. But it appears that, when He became man and dwelt among us, of this infinite knowledge He only possessed as much as was imparted to Him. And this being the case, we must see that, if anything which could not be known naturally was not made known to Him by the Father, it would not be known by Him."—Charge 1863, p. 110. The first Article states that in the Godhead of the one living and true God there are three persons of one substance, power, and eternity—these attributes being necessarily'eternal and inalienable. The second Article states that the nature of man, or the man¬ hood (but not a human personality), was joined with the Person of God the Son, who is of one substance, power, and eternity with God the Father and God the Holy Ghost. Dr. O'Brien asserts that for one generation God the Son was stripped of His Power and' His Omniscience, and as these attributes are involved in the Divine Substance, He ceased for that</page><page sequence="107">THE REV.

I cite this as showing the wide and liberal inter¬ pretation which has been the established rule of the English Church. *13* The following quotations are from the sermons of the Rev. Charles Khigsley, Chaplain to the Queen, and late Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge. It will be observed that he makes the same attack on certain prevailing views and common notions that I have made. In " The Good News of God," page 35, he says:— " There is a notion abroad, borrowed from the old Kinesley. monks, that this earth is in some way bad and cursed; that a curse is on it still for man's sake The Psalmist always speaks of this earth, and of all created things, as if there was no curse at all on them, saying that all things serve God, and that ' He has given them a law which cannot be broken;' and in the face of those words let who will talk of the earth being cursed, I will not; and you shall not, if I can help it." At page 57, in a sermon on " Worship," ova: L- " If God be, as some fancy, hard and arbitrary, then n&amp;Ai you must worship Him in a way in which a hard, ikmh/ arbitrary person would like to be addressed, with all Li- - crouching, and cringing, and slavish terror."

" God, I say, will judge righteous judgment, and take us as we are." In a sermon on " The Letter and the Spirit," page 125, Mr. Kingsley says :— " Some people worship quite a different God from that (viz., one who is ready to give more than we desire or deserve). They fancy that God is harsh, that he sits judging each man by the letter of the law, watching and marking down every little fault which they commit, extreme to mark what is done amiss, and that in the very face of Scripture. They forget altogether that God is their Father. And I tell you of it, that it is not Christian at all, but heathen; and I say to you, as St. Paul bids me say, God, who made the world For in Him we live and move and have our being, and are the offspring—the children—of God.

It kills the souls of the congrega¬ tion, or would kill them, if God's wisdom and love were not stronger than his ministers' folly and harshness.

" In the sermon on " Salvation," page 198, Mr. Kiugsley says:— " The common notion of salvation now-a-days is this, ' That salvation is some arrangement, or plan, by which people are to escape hell-fire by having Christ's righte¬ ousness imputed to them without their being righteous themselves.'" Page 201 :— " But His purpose is to save—to save His people from their sins, to purge out of them all hypocrisy, falsehood, injustice, and make of them honest men, true men, just men. And this is the meaning of His salvation, and is the only salvation worth having, for this life or the life to come." In the sermon on " The Heavenly Father," page 243: — " Now here was a Gospel; here was goodness. St. Paul told them—as the missionaries afterwards told our forefathers—this one, at least, of their heathen fancies was not wrong. There was a Heavenly Father. Man¬ kind was not an orphan, come into the world he knew not whence, and going, when he died, he knew not whither. No, man was not an orphan. From God he came; to God, if he chose, he might return. The heathen poet had spoken truth when he said, ' For we are the off¬ spring of God.' But where was the Heavenly Father? Far away in the clear sky, in the highest heaven beyond all suns and stars? Silent and idle, caring for no one on earth, content in himself, and leaving sinful man to himself, to go to ruin as he chose? ' No,' says St. Paul, 'He is not far from any one of us; for in Him we live and move and have our being!' Wonderful words!</page><page sequence="111">THE CHARLES REV. KINGSLEY.

The folly and madness of men's hearts, who look on God dying on the cross for them, and begin forthwith puzzling their brains as to how He died for them; how Christ's blood washed away their sins; how it is apjslied, and to whom; puzzling their brains with theories of the atonement, and with predestination, and satisfaction, and forensic justification, and particular redemption, and long words which (four out of five of them) are not in the Bible, but are spun out of men's own minds, as spiders' webs are from spiders—and like them, mostly fit to hamper poor harmless flies."

Certainly I have not handled the Creeds or other formularies used in the Church of England with greater freedom than Bishop Watson, who says of the Articles— Bishop " I never troubled myself with any unnecessary argu- Watson. ments which the opponents in the Divinity Schools brought against the Articles of the Church, nor ever admitted their authority as decisive of a difficulty. But I used on such occasions to say to them—holding the New Testament in my hand, En sacrum codicem!— Behold the sacred text! Here is the fountain of truth. Why do you follow the streams derived from it by the sophistry, or polluted by the passions of men. Articles of Churches are not of divine authority.

Of the Creeds he says, with even greater inci- siveness— " I certainly dislike the imposition of all creeds by human authority; though I do not dislike them as useful summaries of what their compilers believe to be true, either in natural or revealed religion As to revealed religion, though all its doctrines are expressed in one book, yet such a diversity of inter¬ pretations have been given to the same passages of Scripture that not only individuals, but whole churches, have formed to themselves different creeds, and intro¬ duced them into their forms of worship These (the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian) and other Creeds which might be mentioned, are all of human fabrication. They oblige conscience as far as they are</page><page sequence="113">BISHOP WATSON. 113" conformable to Scripture, and of that conformity every man must judge for himself. " This liberty of private judgment is recognised by our Church (notwithstanding subscription to the Thirty- Nine Articles) when, in the Service of the Ordering of Priests, it proposes this question—'Are you determined, out of the said Scriptures, to instruct the people com¬ mitted to your charge, and to teach nothing as required of necessity to eternal salvation, but that which rou shall be persuaded may be concluded and improved by the Scriptures ?' "—Ib. pp. 395—397. So again of the Catechism, he asks— " What are the Catechisms of the Romish Church, of the English Church, of the Scotch, and of all other churches, but a set of propositions which men of different natural capacities, educations, prejudices, have fabricated (sometimes on the anvil of sincerity, oftener on that of interest, ignorance, or hypocrisy) from the Divine mate¬ rials furnished by the Bible And can any man of an enlarged charity believe that his salvation will ultimately depend on a concurrence in opinion with any of these niceties which the several sects of Christians have assumed as essentially necessary for a Christian man's belief ?—Ib. ii. p. 215. The Articles as Articles of Peace. I have declared my general assent to the doctrine of the Church of England; I have urged, as many of the most learned and exalted in the Church of England have urged before me, that, where there is this general agreement with the spirit of her teaching, the Articles and Formularies are not to be used for purposes of condemnation on technical grounds of literal interpretation. On this point I cite the forcible words of the Dean of Westminster :— " There is a hope that they may become, as they are Stanley. called by these two Primates (Bramhall and Usher), H</page><page sequence="114">114 THE DEAN OF WESTMINSTER.

' That work which Tract XC. effected will never be undone, so long as the Articles shall last.5 That work, indeed, in a far deeper sense than the authors of those words intended, never will be undone—the work of showing how every opinion can find its resting-place somewhere in their manifold statements; how none can be condemned merely because of apparent inconsistency with them; how none can be taunted with neglecting their details, if he accepts their general substance; how inadequate and powerless they are as expressions of absolute dogmatic truth. They may still be read as guides to the theology of the Reformation; they may still be used as protections for the weaker party in the Church; they may still bo employed as indications of the form which the general doctrine of Christianity took in England in the sixteenth century. .But they can be no more used, as they have hitherto been used—for the purpose of multiplying divi¬ sion and distrust, and of furnishing food for those unhappy insinuations of dishonesty, and inconsistency, and perfidy, which apply either to no one or to every¬ one, and which either invite legal processes against every one, or against no one, of all those who have signed them, from the Primate down to the Curate, from the extremest Liberal to the extremest Conser¬ vative of the laymen who vote in the Oxford Convoca¬ tion."—Essays on Church and State, p. 241.

They introduce prac¬ tices into its worship which confessedly have not been in use since the time of Elizabeth. They desire to substitute for it, as far as outward forms, gestures, dresses, teaching, suppressions, interpolations will allow, the worship of another Church; they speak with the utmost disparagement of the Articles; they explain away the meaning of many of them to such a point as to reduce them to an absolute nullity; they set aside the authority of bishops almost as entirely as if they were Presbyterians or Independents; they abhor the union of Church and State, on which the whole of the existing constitution of the Anglican Church is founded; they belong to a party which has, in late years at least, always attempted to claim the Church for itself; they present, therefore, the extremest case which can arise to test the comprehensiveness of the National Church. But to that comprehension, we have already said that they are fully entitled when they do not violate the wishes and rights of their congregations.

' It seems impossible,' says Mr. Westcott, ' to avoid the conclusion that the framers of the Articles intended to leave a freedom of judgment on a point on which the greatest of the continental reformers, and even of the Romish scholars, were divided. Of this freedom,' he continues, ' the great writers of the Church of Eng¬ land have not availed themselves.' But it is a freedom which does not lapse by neglect. It is a freedom which even, according to the strictest letter of the law, justified Archbishop Howley, as we have seen, in receiving Arnold, though he rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, and which would have justified Archbishop Parker in receiving Calvin, though he doubted the authenticity of the Second Epistle of St. Peter."—Ibid. p. 87. On the contradiction of the Formularies the Dean writes— " When Mr. Wilson speaks of the Athanasian Creed Stanley, as 'unhappy,' this expression is doubtless not less (or more) repugnant to the Eighth Article than Archbishop Tillotson's celebrated wish ' that we were well rid of it.' When he expresses his belief that virtuous heathens will be saved, it is not less (or more) repugnant to the Eighteenth Article than St. Peter's declaration that ' in every nation he that feareth God and worketh righteous¬ ness is accepted of Him,' and the numerous confirmations of that inspired truth from Justin Martyr downwards. But we should like to see the man who for such contra¬ dictions as these will venture to call his brother to account. Let him who agrees with every word and statement of the Formularies cast the first stone at these variations.

ST.-fi- tO fl It will be seen from these quotations, which might be extended indefinitely, that great diver¬ sity of opinion prevails among clergymen, and even bishops; that they all, in various ways more or less traverse some statement in the Articles and Creeds; and that many of the most eminent of them have gone much further away from the Articles and Creeds than I have on the most important subjects which form the ground of this prosecution. I wish to call special attention to the fact, that I have not made a single quotation from the writings of clergy¬ men of that school of opinion with which I am identified. To have done so would have been to appear to shelter myself under what might be the errors of others, and this I would not do. The Dean of Westminster's confession that— " If agreement with every word and statement of the Formularies be required, all clergymen of what¬ ever school, who have the slightest knowledge of their own opinions and of the letter of the Prayer Book and Articles, must go out one by one, beginning at the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Palace of Lambeth, even down to the humblest curate in the wilds of Cumberland," has become a proverb, and although I am aware that I cannot plead to be acquitted</page><page sequence="119">FIRST ARTICLE. 119 because others are guilty, I have brought forward these illustrations of divergence of opinion on what are called vital points, with a special refer¬ ence to my own case. It will be seen how entirely unavoidable such differences are, whenever we consider some of the leading statements in our Articles and Creeds in juxta-position; and I believe that I shall be able, by this means, not only to trace these differences to a common source, so as to account for them in a very simple and intelligible way, but at the same time to furnish positive support of my own teaching from the Articles and Creeds. It will be convenient to commence with the subject of the third group of Articles of Charge, which relates to the Being of God and the mode of his existence. We have first, standing, as it were, as the very foundation of all belief, a plain unqualified statement, resting on many utterances of Holy Scripture, and most of all on the direct testimony of Jesus Christ himself. Article of Religion I. " There is but one Living and True God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, the Maker and Preserver of all things visible and invisible." One cannot even repeat these words without a sense of mingled awe and delight—without emotions of the deepest reverence. Every word tells; it is perfectly intelligible throughout, and so far as man is at all able to predicate anything truly of the mys-</page><page sequence="120">120 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF RELIGION. terious Being of God, these words accord entirely with his Reason, his Conscience, and his Heart. The same doctrine we find repeated in briefer form at the very beginning of the most ancient Creed, viz., the " Apostles' Creed," " I believe in God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth," the word " God " being, in this Creed, applied only to the Father. In the Mcene Creed, the opening clause is nearly the same; only it is intensified by the addi¬ tion of the word " one" before " God." " I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible." The doctrine contained in these three important statements, I need scarcely point out, has given their form to by far the greater portion of our Church prayers and thanksgivings; but that is not to the pur¬ pose just now. I desire to fasten the attention on these three grand utterances as being nearly identical, certainly not contradictory to or exclusive of each other, and perfectly simple and intelligible. One can only understand from them that there is absolutely only one true God, without a body, without any capacity for human suffering, perfectly undivided and indivisible, and that this one true God is the Father Almighty. Now, still using our God-given human intellect, often called " carnal reason," let us compare with those statements certain others which directly follow them. I am speaking now as a man, not as a theologian, as a human being, and not as one en-</page><page sequence="121">FIRST ARTICLE. 121 dowed with fabulous mental faculties different from ordinary intellect. Following the statement that " there is but one living and true God, everlasting, without parts," we read "and in unity of this Godhead, there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." On reading this, I notice, first, the introduction of a new and an abstract term, " Godhead "—" this God¬ head "—though only " God " in the concrete, was first named. " Divina natura," cannot be exactly the same as " Deus." I am really puzzled by the phrase " In unity of this Godhead." It is not simple. Does it mean "In this one God" or does it not? Was not that one God described as an individual Being, possessing a will manifested in the creation and preservation of the universe, exercising not only infinite power which might belong to a blind force, but also infinite wisdom, which can belong only to intellect, and infinite goodness, which is the attribute only of a moral Being And now the Article draws away my mind from this concrete conception of God into an abstract idea of" Godhead " which it has never defined, and of which it is going on to say still more to puzzle me. " In the unity of this Godhead there be three Persons of one substance, power, and eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." Now so far as this language is intelligible at all, it can only be understood as saying that there are three</page><page sequence="122">122 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF RELIGION. somethings (persons not being defined) all alike in nature and in certain attributes, and that they have each a separate name, viz., the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost respectively. This, of course, is intelligible by itself, just as a man might say '' Here are three things, all made of of one substance, all equal in strength, and all made at one time, and are distinguished from each other by the names A. B. C." To say this of three iron bars, or three bricks of clay, would be to say something grammatically ana¬ logous to the passage in question. But still there is a difficulty to the human intellect in the names given, "Father " and " Son," which cannot easily be overcome. The three somethings are all equal in eternity, i.e. in length of life, and yet two of them are designated by relative terms, which, to the human reason, imply that one is older than the other, the one a cause, and the other an effect of that cause. It may be said that these names do not carry doctrine so much as the other statement "of one substance, power, and eternity" does. But it leaves us still perplexed. What we are certain of having read in this first Article, and in the Creeds, is that there is absolutely only one living and true God, and that He has no parts, cannot be divided into three or any other num¬ ber of Beings; and also that there are three distinct Beings, or Persons, in the one Godhead, all of one substance, power, and eternity, and that these three Persons are distinguished from each other by three</page><page sequence="123">FIRST ARTICLE AND THE CREEDS. 123 separate names. Moreover, one of the Persons "Father," is, in the Nicene Creed, called the " One God," and in the Apostles' Creed, the term " God " is only applied to the name of Father. It has been repeatedly acknowledged by Divines, that the human mind, under the highest cultiva¬ tion yet known, can only recognise the sense of these two clauses, thus interpreted, separately. The human mind cannot assent rationally to both of them at once. In other words, they are directly contradictory to each other, and are mutually exclusive. Those who think or say they accept them both, openly avow that the reconciliation of the two is above or beside human reason; that human reason cannot grasp both propo¬ sitions at once, and that it never can penetrate what they call the " Divine mystery of the Trinity.' Well, this is all I am saying. A rational being perceives the entire contradiction between these two statements, (though there might be none in the real doctrine of the Trinity, if we only understood it) he can never do otherwise so long as he preserves his reason and exercises it. To pass now to the Athanasian Creed, all its state¬ ments are intelligible, each by itself, except those which attempt to do in words what cannot be done by the intellect. No .one professes to understand or to explain this passage " That we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance." Or this, "In all things, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity</page><page sequence="124">124 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF RELIGION. in Unity is to be worshipped," while every one can understand these, " Yet they are not three Gods but one God," and " Every Person by himself to be God and Lord," or " The whole three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal." These doctrines must take one of two shapes in the human mind; either that the three Persons are three parts or divisions of one substance called " Godhead," which contradicts the First Article of Religion, which says that there is but one true God, without parts—id est, indivisible; or that there are three Gods all alike, which contradicts it likewise, and contradicts, at the same time, the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds. On the other hand, if the human mind apprehends and believes that there is only one living and true God, indivisible, it cannot, at the same time, believe in three somethings, each of which is declared to be by himself Lord and God. The doctrine of the Trinity thus degenerates into Tritheism, through the in¬ capacity of the human reason to comprehend it. ' The Monotheistic and the Tritheistic elements in our Articles and Creeds, I therefore venture to sub¬ mit, seem to human reason intrinsically and eternally contradictory to each other. The Church may en¬ deavour to neutralise the one or the other or both, but she can only do so by statements which to the human mind are simply unmeaning and unintelligible. She has distinctly declared Monotheism, and as distinctly condemned Tritheism, and yet has given grounds for the Tritheist to insist on his Tritheism,</page><page sequence="125">MONOTHEISM AND TRITHEISM. 125 and has done this in propositions from which the human reason cannot fail to draw conclusions at once Monotheistic and Tritheistic. The Trinitarian doc¬ trine, when stated in words, degenerates into Tri¬ theism, Again using our human intellect, we turn to Articles of Religion II., III., and IV., and compare them honestly with the first clause of the Article I. I need not read every word. The sense will be suffi¬ ciently conveyed in this extract. " The Son (already referred to in the First Article) very and eternal God, took man's nature, so that two whole and perfect natures, the Godhead and the Man¬ hood, were joined together, in one person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very man, who truly suffered, was crucified, dead and buried, to reconcile His Father to us. He went down into Hell and did truly rise again from death, and took again His body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of man's nature ; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth." To these may be added other clauses from the Apostles', Nicene and Athanasian Creeds, the last of which gives the following additional statements:— " God begotten before the worlds, and man born in the world. Perfect God and perfect man, of a reason¬ able soul and human flesh subsisting. Who, although He be God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ." These passages comprise the main part of the Church's teaching on this point, and I cannot here</page><page sequence="126">126 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF RELIGION. forget the warning given in the King's Declaration which precedes the Articles— " No man shall put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense." As a human being, then, and as the subject of the law, I must exercise in the most simple manner my natural powers of understanding words, and take these articles literally. If I do so, I then find the following absolute and direct contradictions:— Let me state them in syllogism. A. The only one living and true God is without body. B. But God the Son is not without body. C. Therefore God the Son is not the one living and true God. and this— D. The one living and true God is without parts and without passions.^ E. But God the Son has parts—i.e., Godhead and manhood—and has passions—i.e., has suffered human suffering. F. Therefore God the Son is not the one living and true God. Your Lordships will tell me if I have drawn these syllogisms correctly, or if my premisses are not according to the words—the literal and grammatical sense of the Articles of Religion. Again, the Second Article says :—</page><page sequence="127">IN THE FIRST ARTICLE OF RELIGION. 127 " Two whole and perfect natures—that is to say, the Godhead and the Manhood, were joined together in one person never to be divided." Is there any distinction between the things spoken of under the two terms, a God " and " Godhead " Does " Godhead " mean exactly the same as " God " As a human being I can hardly think it does, or why adopt the term at all Just as " Manhood " does not imply "all man" or "all men" in the concrete, so " Godhead " does not imply " all God " or " all Gods" in the concrete. Surely the phrase seems to imply that neither the Father nor the Holy Ghost, but only the Son, was joined to manhood. Now negatives are exclusive. G. The Father was not made man. H. But the Son was made man. I. Therefore the Son is not the Father. If we can say of one that he is not the other, we affirm distinctness, separateness of individuality, there¬ fore two arithmetically. Two what Each is God, therefore two Gods. Another difficulty in the way of the human reason is the question of the personality of Christ. There is nothing stated in the Articles and Creeds, to prevent my putting the same sense on the word " person " or "persons," in the First and Second Articles of Religion, and the Athanasian Creed. In one place it is used in the ordinary sense of human language. By the word person we now mean an individual human being, not identical with any other person or</page><page sequence="128">128 EXAMINATION OF ARTICLES OF RELIGION. human being. But this is, of course, not the sense in which it is used in the First Article. The Second Article affirms that the " two na¬ tures were joined together in one person." But it does not say whether that person was a Divine person or a human person, or neither, or both. Into this point the Athanasian Creed goes more deeply by saying that " Christ subsisted of a reasonable soul and human flesh"; and afterwards says, " As the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ," which is equiva- lent to the assertion that " God " occupied the place of the reasonable soul in the person of Christ; there¬ fore when the flesh was laid in the tomb, the Divine nature, or " God," went down into Hell, becoming divided from that human nature which he took in the Virgin's womb, and from which the Article says it was (once joined to it) " never to be divided." This offers another instance of what seems to the human reason, direct contradiction. Almost everyone believes that Christ was a human person: the human personality of Christ forms a pro¬ minent feature in nearly all sermons of every school of theology, and yet if Christ was only one person, He could not be a Divine person as well as a human one. The Catholic Church foreseeing this, denied any human personality to Christ, and ascribed to Him only the Divine personality; whereas our Church has left this all-important matter undecided, contenting herself with the vague declaration that Christ is only</page><page sequence="129">• PERSONALITY OF CHRIST. 129 one person. But if Christ be only one person, in the light of human reason it is manifest that He cannot be at one and the same time very God and very man, for personality is certainly essential to true manhood. If Christ be only one person, and that a human person, then He is very man and nothing more. If He be only one person, and that a Divine one, He is very God, and not very man. The human personality seems, however, to be distinctly taught in the Fifteenth Article, which says, " Christ, in the truth of our nature, was made (factus est) like unto us in all things, sin only except." Personality is surely one of the essentials of our nature. If Canon Liddon's admis¬ sion—that Jesus had no human personality—be adopted, then 99 out of every 100 clergymen and laymen are in the wrong. Most men are as con¬ vinced as they are of their own existence that when Jesus taught in the temple, or sat down to eat, it was a human person, speaking and eating. Whatever answer they may give when their theological belief is challenged, their practical teaching always assumes the human personality as a matter of course. If, then, in one instance, popular teaching and prevailing views are utterly unorthodox on such a vital point, it is at least as possible that other dogmas of popular theology which I have assailed, e.g. Tritheism, have no better sanction in the Articles of Religion than that of the human personality of Christ. And in regard to the reconciliation of the Father to us by means of the Son, the human mind cannot by I</page><page sequence="130">130 THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK. any possibility conceive of such a transaction without distinctly separating two of the Beings here spoken of as God. One of them is represented as being in a state of mind or feeling towards men in which the other is not. Now, no one Being can at one and the same moment be in a state of alienation from, and in a state of reconciliation with, the same object. These doc¬ trines as commonly taught, whether true or not (I am not raising this question at all), simply convey to our human reason the entire and actual separateness of two Beings, each of them said to be God, and there¬ fore they teach the heresy of two Gods. The Archbishop of York in his Bampton Lectures, 1853, p. 168, says:— " There is some danger, too, lest the atonement be allowed to degenerate into a transaction between a righteous Father on the one hand, and a loving Saviour on the other, because in the human transaction, from which the analogy is drawn, two distinct parties are concerned ; whereas in the plan of salvation one will alone operates, and in the Father and the Son alike justice and love are reconciled." In the same way the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son seems to imply that there are three Gods, to say nothing of the affirmation of the Athanasian Creed, " Every person by himself is God and Lord." I have dwelt upon this part of the Articles and Creeds with no unworthy intention of disturbing the minds of my brethren, but only and solely to show that it always has been, and is now more than ever, a</page><page sequence="131">ARTICLES OUGHT NOT TO BE LEGAL TESTS. 131 huge blunder to make these Articles and Creeds into legal documents — an act of absolute injustice to make it criminal in any clergyman to contradict them, since it is absolutely impossible to teach in harmony with one part without contradicting another part. What would be said of our Statute Law—our Acts of Parliament— if they were so framed that we could not observe one clause without violating another clause of the same Act And if this would not be permitted to continue, even if it could ever by over¬ sight have once occurred, in matters relating to our common social and national obligations, how much less ought it to be allowed to continue in matters confessedly belonging to a region of thought, where exact knowledge of the truth is impossible, and where undefined feelings of awe and aspiration continually outstrip language. Speaking now for myself, I frankly admit that the doctrines of the Son of God in Christ and of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men have been most surely stepping stones whereby I have reached certain convictions about the relation of God the Father to all mankind, which are full of comfort and hope, and pregnant with the highest moral benefit to the world. But as commonly understood, and as commonly taught, the doctrines have practically degenerated into Tritheism, and that not only to the denial of Monotheism, and in the face of the Church's most plain and solemn declarations, but also to the far worse dishonour of the Supreme Being who has been</page><page sequence="132">132 MONOTHEISM, DITHEISM, AND TRITHEISM. awfully and shamefully outraged by being drawn in outlines repulsive alike to the reason, the conscience, and the affections of man. If we are to have tests at all in a large and com¬ prehensive body like the established Church, we must have statements of doctrine more or less mutually contradictory in order to embrace oppo¬ site schools of thought. Even such a simple thing as a Creed to be spoken by the congregation cannot be drawn up without including the divergent objects of faith dear to the different members of it. But in spite of Tritheistic and Polytheistic theories, men are generally Monotheists at heart, or else only Ditheists—believing in two Gods, one of which is friendly to them, the other hostile. For purposes of love and trust, however, of refuge from peril, of praise for deliverance, of consolation in distress, men are by nature Monotheists; and it is to this fact that we owe the distinct and emphatic Monotheism of our Articles and Creeds, while the apparent Tritheism is merely the result of comprehension in which the different schools of believers might find each its own satisfactory ex¬ pression. At present, here in England, as it was in India for many generations before Christ, with regard to Vishnu, who, it is said, became ten times incarnate for a suffering world, Jesus is the supreme and almost sole object of worship and trust among many Christians, id est, as man, he is raised above the Father in the hearts of worshippers. As a matter of fact the love of and the faith in the</page><page sequence="133">MONOTHEISM, DITHEISM, AND TRITHEISM. 133 Holy Ghost, as a personal friend of man, has sunk to a mere empty name, and is dying out as a religion even among the Society of Friends who once were dis¬ tinguished for making it a reality. It is well known that the school of theology, which professes to take the Rev. Professor Maurice for its chief, are simply Ditheists, and that with them the third Person of the Sacred Trinity is now in practice, though not in terms, little more than a mere name; and certainly among them the " Holy Ghost is not worshipped and glorified together with the Father and the Son." There is now rising up in the bosom of our own Church a school of opinion almost identical with that of Swedenborg, which recognises only one God and Lord, viz., Jesus Christ; and in their interpre¬ tations of Holy Scripture the very name of Jehovah is said to be exclusively his. Now, I say that all these facts bear with very great force upon my case. Look where you will, your Lord¬ ships will see that men are contradicting either the real Monotheism or the apparent Tritheism of our Ar¬ ticles and Creeds. They cannot help doing so, if they wish to avoid talking nonsense. They must do so when ever they are themselves reallyreligious, and are trying to lead their fellow-men to be so too. To condemn me for a general departure from the spirit of Tritheis¬ tic theology would be an easy matter indeed; but scarcely any course would seem to be more unjust, when I can prove at every turn how I am sustained and sheltered by the pure Monotheism laid down in</page><page sequence="134">134 EXAMINATION OF THE ARTICLES OF RELIGION, the Articles and Creeds and in the devotional parts of the Prayer Book, and when I have endeavoured to respect, and have respected, both the letter of the law and the convictions of my brethren, by framing my language so as not to contradict a single statement in the Articles and Creeds—that is to say, I have never contradicted those Articles and Creeds to the tenth part of the degree in which they contradict themselves. But is this all that can be urged? By no means. Let me briefly compare some more of the doctrines of the Articles and Creeds with the changes of opinion revealed by modern Divines. The whole of our Articles have been written from the stand point of the doctrine of necessity, of which the theological equivalents are Predestination and Election. That doctrine even colours the terms in which the atonement is described in the Second Article of Religion. This is spoken of as a " Reconciliation of the Father to us " instead of that " Reconciliation of us to the Father," which we sorely need. It is thus described as a something which altered the mind of God, not ours. Now-a-days, that expression, and the very idea of it, has been abandoned by nearly all the clergy. The Wesleys had much to do with this change—not a slight one—for which they were, in their day, regarded as heretics. Now, on the con¬ trary, their teaching is literally copied by the whole Evangelical section of the Church, without their perceiving the contradiction to the Second Article which it involves, and without being threatened with prosecution. m</page><page sequence="135">DEPARTURES FROM ORTHODOXY. 135 The doctrine of Necessity is again affirmed in Article of Religion X., by denying that of Free Will, which is generally insisted on by preachers of un¬ questioned orthodoxy. The doctrine of Predestination or Election, as stated in the Seventeenth Article of Religion, is denied in nearly every Church in our land, and I question whether more than two Bishops on the Bench, if there are so many, believe in Election at all. Cal¬ vinism has given place to Arminianism. The language of our Articles of Religion, respect¬ ing the descent of Christ into hell, and His bodily resurrection and ascension, is repeatedly violated, because the stream of modern thought runs quite in a different channel. Even the Clergy and Bishops are no longer brought up to regard the cosmical arrangements in the same light as they appeared to our forefathers in the sixteenth century. It is in the power of anyone to ask, Do you believe this?—viz., that the body of Jesus Christ arose from a sepulchre guarded by Roman soldiers, the true physical and visible body of a human being; that the body so risen, a local, tangible and sensible body, which could eat and drink and walk and talk, actually ascended, after a given time, but in a state unchanged as to flesh, bones and all other things appertaining to the perfection (ad integritatem) of man's nature, from a given spot on a Syrian hill into a local heaven literally and geographically always above it, where that same body coild sit down and actually did</page><page sequence="136">136 DEPARTURES FROM ORTHODOXY. sit down in a given place designated as " God's right hand;" and that from that same spot geographically' above the Syrian hill referred to, the same body will one day descend, upon which occasion all the saints upon earth, those in England, and those in South Wales, those in Russia, and those in the Sandwich Islands, will simultaneously rise—as if from a vast plain—to meet a being in the air as local and circumstantial as themselves, If no man of education, either on the Episcopal Bench, or among the ranks of ordinary clergy or laity, continues to teach all this in its plain and literal sense, how can any of them have the hardihood to accuse any of their brethren of heresy It is of no avail in a Court of Law to plead that this or that is an Article of minor import¬ ance. All the Articles of Religion are, I presume, equally important in the eyes of the Law, and every divergence from, or contradiction to, any single state¬ ment of the Articles and Creeds is equally a breach of the law. The belief in a personal devil, taught in our Articles and Church Catechism, and incorporated into our Liturgy, has so much become an object of ridicule alike with the educated and uneducated laity that some of the Dignitaries of our Church, vhen referring to the subject, feel it necessary to apologise for adhering to what they see is now an obsolete conviction. Moreover, a large section of our clergy have openly and advisedly confessed their adherence to the doc¬ trines, and their desire to conform to the Ritual of</page><page sequence="137">THE RITUALISTS. 137 the Church of Rome, declaring, as I have heard with my own ears, that the doctrines of the two Churches are identical, and that the only difference between them is a question of ecclesiastical polity. Need I say that our Articles of Religion teem with direct and intentional attacks upon those very doctrines which some of our clergy are reviving with all the zeal they can bring to the cause, or that the majority of those Articles were expressly framed as protests against the doctrines of the Church of Rome? To this fact we owe at least the modern use of the term " Pro¬ testant Church," and it is openly avowed by Dr. Littledale and his school that Protestantism and all that it implies is hateful to him, and that the Re¬ formers, among whom are included the framers of the 39 Articles, were "rogues and scoundrels." Without enumerating the instances in which the open violation of Protestant Articles is exhibited, I would only recall to mind the rebellious spirit which many of the clergy, both among High Churchmen and Evangelicals, manifested, and in which they were greatly encouraged by certain Prelates of our Church, on the occasion of the judgment pronounced by this Court in the cases of Dr. Williams and Mr. Wilson. Now I insist that my case is altogether unlike that of the Ritualists. If I have in any sense departed from one portion of the Articles, so as by silence to have lent them no support, I have not depraved them nor contradicted them; I</page><page sequence="138">138 SUMMARY OF MY OWN TEACHING. have only taken up another portion of those Articles which commended itself to my understand¬ ing, and have taught the truth which that portion contained with all my heart and soul. I have only carried out to its legitimate conclusions the sublime statement—" There is but one living and true God, everlasting, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker and Preserver of all things visible and in¬ visible." I have clung as closely as I could to the simple but grand confession of faith—" I believe in one God, the Father Almighty "—and in doing this I have been compelled, as I have shown in this appeal, to run counter in spirit to the Tritheistic doctrines, which, though denounced in the plainest terms, are yet believed to be taught by our Church; just as all Tritheistic teaching runs counter to the strong Mono¬ theistic declarations in our Articles and Creeds. But I have not denied more than I could help. I have admitted, in terms which I could honestly use, that we are all sinners and " have come short of the glory of God;" that the sins of men are cursed, and deserve and receive God's sentence of condemnation; that the death of Christ on our behalf was a sacrifice, and a sacrifice for sins, and that He came into the world to bring men to God. I have affirmed, only with a wider application, that He was the Son of God, that God was in Him; and I have made a practical appli¬ cation of the doctrine of the Holy Ghost, by showing that God, who is Spirit, is the Father of our spirits, the Lord and Giver of Life, more especially the life</page><page sequence="139">SUMMARY OF MY OWN TEACHING. 139 of our immortal souls, and that He is with us and abideth with us for ever. Using the language of Apostles, I have said to my hearers, " Know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you"—"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him." In this I have followed Athanasius himself, who in his Second Oration says " that we are to be made Gods, Qeo-Koir}Q?ivai, capable of Deity, Sercn/col deoTTjTos, and that Christ was a sort of Demiurge renewing us that we might be Deified." Ignatius of Smyrna, too, always called himself o deo^opo?, ' the God-bearing.' I have affirmed that Christ ever liveth, and that we shall all live, even in what we call our death, as did He, and shall rise to that higher sphere in which He now reigns for evermore. Of man's original or birth- sin, I have affirmed that we are all by nature sinners. Of justification, I have plainly avowed my prefer¬ ence for the Church's doctrines over those errors which the Xlth Article of Religion was framed to deny. I have only pointed out such a much more exalted view of God than what was recognised in the sixteenth century, that it dispenses altogether with the need of Justification as popularly interpreted, and sets us free from those feelings which originated all doctrines of a similar kind. Taking benefit of the Church's express declarations of her own falhbility, and her assertion that all Churches, including herself, have erred, not only in rites and cere - monies, but also in matters of faith, I have ventured to</page><page sequence="140">140 SUMMARY OF MY OWN TEACHING. suggest subjects on which her Articles and Creeds might with propriety be re-considered, and in this I have been left far behind by eminent clergymen of unimpeached orthodoxy, some of whose writings I have already quoted. Following the example of the Re¬ formers, and animated, I trust, with their spirit and principles, I have both practised and inculcated the exercise of private judgment, and have endeavoured to lead men to aspire to a continual progress in the knowledge of God. Of Holy Scripture, I have taught that it " contains all things necessary to salvation," a proposition which is openly denied by the self-styled " Catholics " among our own clergy. I have affirmed that— " The Bible contains the highest truth about God in any given age within historical limits, and therefore stands by itself as occupying a field of enquiry never trespassed on by any other collection of ancient writings, and as dealing, both directly and indirectly, with a topic of infinite and inexhaustible interest to men." I go on to say in my sermon (Vol. II., part 3, "Sling and Stone")— " Observe, I am now only speaking of the Bible as if we were strangers to the blessed and everlasting truths which it contains. I want you to get and to keep a good common-sense view of what the Bible really is, and then you will not value it any the less; but you will take a still deeper and more intelligent interest in it than you ever had before If you look (into the Bible) with a keen and pious eye for what commends itself to the reason and conscience of men, you will find views of God equal to the noblest which men have ever conceived ; you will find a spiritual worship inculcated, and a spiritual creed set forth, high enough to ravish</page><page sequence="141">ACT OF SUBSCRIPTION. 141 the heart of the most devout, and to inspire the faith of the most rational; you will find, moreover, maxims and examples of such a virtue and manliness as the world has never yet learned to obey, and has never been able to surpass." This is only one passage out of many where such language of mine is to be found. I have selected it, however, at this moment, because, incredibile dictu, it is one of the passages on which the prosecution has fastened a charge of heresy. What, then, have I done amiss? I have drawn from the armoury of the Bible, and especially from the reported sayings of Jesus himself, my strongest weapons in attacking error and superstition; and for doing this, am I to be condemned as a heretic? I cannot for a moment suppose so. And again I say, if I have taught any new doctrine, the Legislature alone can pronounce as to its being heresy or not. I have only affirmed what the Articles do not deny, and have denied what the Articles do not affirm. I do not know how far the Court can recognise the importance of the change in the Act of Sub¬ scription which the Archbishop of York, in a charge delivered in 1865, regarded as likely to present considerable difficulties in the way of prosecutions for heresy. The change in the terms of subscription now required by the clergy surely implies one plain truth—the justice of releasing them from the obligation to assent ex animo to every proposition in the Articles. But if it be just to release them from the obligation of .belief, it is surely no less just to allow them a corre-</page><page sequence="142">142 ACT OF SUBSCRIPTION. sponding liberty of speech. If this liberty of speech be denied to them, it would amount to no less than the assertion that the clergy must disguise their honest convictions, and must, in every case where their conviction contravenes an article, or part of an article, say what they do not really believe. Without this corresponding freedom of speech, the relaxing of our subscription is only a cruel mockery, and an encouragement to downright dishonesty and evasion. And here the question is forced upon me,—What amount of change has been effected by the sub¬ stitution of the present terms of subscription in place of those which had heretofore been required of the Clergy? If any change has been effected by it, surely this must be taken into consideration before a sentence is passed against me for violating those terms. The accused must be judged by present obli¬ gations, not by those under which he may have been supposed to be at the time when he was admitted into Holy Orders. That the former subscriptions (or at least one of them) were an intolerable yoke, and that " short of an alteration in the doctrinal standards themselves no measure more important could have been adopted," has been fully admitted by the Archbishop of York, who would have sat with your Lordships had he not been my prosecutor. Of the declaration enjoined by the Act of Uniformity, the Archbishop says:— Archbishop of " "* *a weU ^at a declaration, the offspring of passion York. and strife, for the faults of which the times were re-</page><page sequence="143">IT ARCHBISHOP OF YORK. 143 sponsible perhaps rather than the men, which was rather intended to be the implement for a sudden political triumph than a permanent safeguard for divine truth, should give way to one drawn in calmer times and with fairer deliberation, intended rather to comprehend than to exclude, and having a juster regard to the tender consciences of some of the brethren. It is gone. In the Commission to which the Queen confided the exami¬ nation of this question, not a voice pleaded for a respite: in Parliament no one demanded an account of its fate." (Charge, October, 1865, p. 29.) The difficulty involved in the change is admitted by the Archbishop— " The words that are now substituted have the incon¬ venience, that being words applicable both to the Articles and the Prayer Book, they are not specially fitted for the peculiar and complex structure of the latter, which is at once a body of devotion and of scriptural instructions, and a directory of devotion and instruction. The declarant now assents to the Book of Common Prayer and will use it; and he also ' acknow¬ ledges the doctrine therein contained to be agreeable to the word of God.' The change is considerable, and perhaps not wholly to our advantage, if ambiguity is an evil. Some one may ask what is the doctrine Is the doctrine of the Book of Common Prayer then that which is implied in it, or only that which is affirmed Can the words 'set forth' comprehend doctrines that are implied but not affirmed The Court of Last Appeal has shown an indispositionto condemn for doctrines only contained by implication in forms of devotion, unless these doctrines are also affirmed elsewhere in dogmatic form. The reluctance is right in pr^uciple, for, since the Church has dogmatic standards, we ought not readily to suppose that she has omitted from these any essential truths which her children are yet to be equally bound to hold with those which she has explicitly affirmed. Where then in the Prayer Book is the doctrine therein set forth to be sought ?—it will be asked. Not in its doctrinal [sic; devotional] parts, for these are not l"?H</page><page sequence="144">144 ARCHBISHOP OF YORK. doctrine. Not in the Creeds; these are the very doctrine of the Church ; but we pledge ourselves to them more fully in the Articles. Not in the passages of Scripture cited in that Book ; for the authority of Scripture too is more appropriately dealt with in the Articles Whereas the former declaration extended to all and every of the Articles, the new one acknow¬ ledges the doctrine of the Church contained in the Articles to be agreeable to the word of God. Here again it cannot be denied that a small opening is left for doubt to creep in. What is the doctrine of the Articles Is it to be sought in all the Articles, or are there some Articles of doctrine and others which are not An old statute (13th Eliz., chap. 12) imposes assent and subscription ' to all the Articles of Religion which only concern the confession of the true Christian faith and the doctrine of the Sacraments,' which certainly recognises this distinction. If the new declaration admitted it again, which would be the Articles of Doctrine, and which would be those beyond the scope of the declaration?" (Charge, p. 34.) "That such objections (the Archbishop adds) may one day arise in a point of law is quite possible. But I do not believe that in the court of conscience they will give rise to much perplexity. Every clergyman will nave to assent to Articles and Prayer Book in a solemn manner, as being the joint exponents of the doctrine of the United Church of England and Ireland, which he believes, and is prepared to administer to his people. " The doctrine is not that of some of the Articles, but of the Thirty Nine. The doctrine of the Church of England is ' set forth' in the Articles in the way of dogmatic statement, and in the Prayer Book in the way of illustration and devotional application. Some of those to whom this declaration is offered may find, solemnly searching their conscience as before God that upon one or ttoo points they have a difficulty in assenting. In that case the important issue will be left to the con¬ science,—whether these points are such and of such moment that the dissentient cannot be said to believe the doctrine of the Church, whether the Church has so pro¬ nounced upon them as to make them indispensable for a minister. The issue is important indeed: but in the</page><page sequence="145">THE DEAN OF WESTMINSTER. 145 " great mass of cases it may safely be left to the con¬ science, and it can'be decided only by her." (Charge, ib. p. 35.) Here, then, I may claim an answer to the question for which the Archbishop of York felt five years ago that an answer would be needed; and I can but urge that my case is one of those to which he refers in the sentences last cited. I have expressed repeatedly my conviction that substantially I am in hearty agree¬ ment with the doctrine of the Church of England, and therefore I claim for myself (not, like Mr. Bennett or Mr. Mackonochie, the exclusive right of repre¬ senting the truth in the Church of England in such sort as to deny the right of membership to those who dissent from them, but) simply that comprehension which includes in its pale not only Mr. Bennett and Mr. Mackonochie, but Dr. Pusey and Mr. Maurice, Mr. Wilson and Dr. Baylee. Of this new form of subscription, Dean Stanley says— " The change is not the less important whether we Stanley. regard it in the light of the actual relief which it affords, or as a proof of the facility with which what was once deemed a necessary bulwark of the Church could be removed. If those who think the recent remedial measure insufficient press their objections, there can be no question that the change from the pre¬ sent form of test to the entire removal of any form would be less than the change from the stringent and elaborate system which existed formerly, to the test as now modified."—(Essays on Church and State, p. 20.) In the minds of lawyers, it may seem wholly irre¬ levant to the issue to take into consideration the</page><page sequence="146">146 THE QUESTION OF TRUTH. question of the truth or falseness of my teaching, and therefore, I cannot appeal to your Lordships on that ground at all. But this is a suit in which, it is to be hoped, the question of truth is uppermost in the'hearts of all those who are interested in the case, whether for or against me. Although my accusers have never yet ventured to meet one of my arguments or to controvert one of my positions, they surely do not wish it to go forth to the world that they do not even care to enquire whether what I have taught be true or not. They would" rather, I imagine, lead the outer Avorld, and the world of religious people in particular, to believe that they have attacked me only and solely because they think that I have taught what is false. This long accusation against me, and the severity with which I have been silenced'would be worse than senseless, were it to be acknowledged on either side that the_ contest was a purely legal one,' Avithout reference to the truth or falsehood of my views. Nothing could bring this prosecution into deeper contempt than the assumption by my accusers of a position of indifference to this higher question, or any position, indeed, which might be taken to imply that they were fighting for orthodoxy, whether orthodoxy be true or false. Yet the prosecution itself is an undeniable proof that the advocates of the popular doctrines which I have denounced consider those doctrines to be in a hopeless case; that they can* not stand a day on their own merits, or without the support of Acts of Parliament, and adverse legal</page><page sequence="147">UNREASONABLENESS OF POPULAR THEOLOGY. 147 decisions against those who assail them. The mo¬ ment they are left to the mercy of enquiry and discussion they must fall for ever. But although I may not challenge your Lordships' opinion as to the truth and reasonableness of what I have taught, it seems to me to have a most important bearing on the issue to keep in mind what the world has heard to weariness out of the mouths of the stoutest champions of traditional orthodoxy. Their one cry is, " You must submit your human reason and your common sense to what is ^revealed." "These doctrines are quite above the grasp of your natural intellect, and they can only be made intelligible to you by a super¬ human influence on your mind." This appeal to a higher sense — a faculty which even this Court cannot summon to its aid—is a tacit admission of the unreasonableness of what the human mind cannot comprehend. And there can only be drawn from that admission these conclusions—that no one is able to teach what he does not understand, and therefore, no clergyman ought to be criminally dealt with for failing to perceive or to preach the exact sense of that which is admitted to be unintelligible. The agreement of my teaching with the Articles and Creeds is made still more manifest by looking at the direct contradictories of my several propositions. My own statements cannot possibly be denied, or their contradictories affirmed, without involving the direct contradiction of some of the Articles and Creeds. No one, in the face of those Articles and Creeds, can dare</page><page sequence="148">148 MY AGREEMENT WITH THE ARTICLES. to say that there is more than one living and true God; no one can dare to say that God is divided into three equal parts; or to say that the one God the Father Almighty has a human body and is susceptible of human passions. Nor dare lie say that.the one living and true God who is the Maker and Preserver of all things visible and invisible, is absent from any part of His universe, or can be truly said to come and go, to and from, a local heaven and our earth. Nor dare he say that God is now absent from this world and from the hearts of His children, and will be so absent until Jesus Christ comes again. The self-styled orthodox dare not, I say, affirm what I have denied. They dare not deny what I have affirmed. They cannot say that the Holy Ghost is not God, or deny that He Avas actually imparted to me at my ordination; that I have been born again, born of the Spirit of God, and thus have become a child of God; all of which I have affirmed—only, as I think, in language more compre¬ hensive and more consistent with reason than theirs. Tn other words, they cannot deny that we men are partakers of the Divine nature; that Ave are not merely animals, the children of earthly parent's, but immortal spirits too, the children of our Heavenly Father. They cannot deny that we have God with us and within us; "that Ave are one with Christ, and Christ is one Avith us; " " that He is firstborn among many brethren, and that God is His Father and our Father, His God and our God." All this is consistent with the language of Scripture, and with</page><page sequence="149">MORAL EFFECTS OF MY TEACHING. 149 the Articles and Church Services, and also consistent with reason, because, as I stated plainly in my sermons on this subject, I have invoked the ima¬ gination. I have not only used figures of speech, but reminded myself and my hearers that I was doing so, and not speaking literally on matters above our finite knowledge. But the essence of what I have taught is so thoroughly supported by the legal standards of doctrine that no one can deny my propositions without contravening the Articles and Creeds. Moreover, I have shown how these views of God's relation to us and of our relation to God tend to elevate man in every part of his nature, to raise his aspirations, to confirm his hopes, to purify his desires, and to refine his conduct. I have shoAvn that they not only tend to produce perfect peace with God and a most happy trust in His good¬ will toAvards us all, but they beget a sense of brotherly love and mutual kindness and toleration such as we only find in the earliest days of Christianity, and most of all in the life of Him Avho was the greatest teacher of these views the world has ever seen. The Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man are correlative truths Avhich cannot be separated. Now I feel sure that the Court will see that I cannot be condemned without involving at the same time the condemnation of the doctrine of the Fatherhood of God, which is the beginning, the middle, and the end of all my teaching, the key to the interpretation of any dark saying which I may have uttered. I know with what bitter hatred this grand truth of Jesus Christ's</page><page sequence="150">150 THE FATHERHOOD OF GOD. Gospel has been and is still regarded, and from that I take refuge in this Court, and place myself under the protection of English laAV. An eminent Scotch divine (Dr. Candlish) said, that "the doctrine of God's universal fatherhood was the cause of all the infidelity of this age;" and no doubt he was right, so far as he meant by " infidelity " the denial of those aAvful doc¬ trines of the popular and traditional theology which I have denounced, and of Avhich he is a zealous advocate. The two systems are diametrically opposed. The respective Supreme Deities of the two systems are, on one side, as set forth in the Articles and Formularies, "a God of infinite goodness;" on the other, a Fiend of infinite malice. The Church of England is not now called upon to condemn this religion of Dr. Candlish's, Avhich has been, till re¬ cently, so common amongst ourselves. It is only called upon to say, Avhether or not the fatherhood of God, the God of infinite goodness, shall be proclaimed or not any longer within her pale. If the First Article of Religion and the opening clauses of the tAvo most ancient Creeds, and the great mass of our Liturgical prayers and praises are not enough to enable her to give a prompt and decided answer in the affirmative, let her ask solemnly in the sight of God. Which is true which is reasonable Avhich doc- rine reflects most clearly the truth of the Divine Being, brings most help and comfort to the souls' of men? But I forget myself. I am appealing, I am thankful to say, not to the Church, but to the State; not to ecclesiastics, but to the Crown.</page><page sequence="151">CONCLUDING APPEAL. 151 I am not here to plead for the expulsion or even for the rebuke of those Avhose teaching can only appear to my mind as the " doctrines of devils."

I am not in favour of any such clumsy and senseless modes as that of legal prosecution of opinion to eliminate error or to establish truth. But I am here only to ask—and I do so with perfect confi¬ dence in your Lordship's justice—that I may be allowed to resume my clerical functions, and continue to teach what the Church teaches, to continue—in that branch of the Church of Christ to which we belong— to proclaim what Jesus Christ himself proclaimed. The National Church, as established in our land, has enshrined in her Articles, Creeds and Formularies such teaching as I have heartily and honestly em¬ braced, and such as I can as heartily and honestly repeat. There it stands, as my justification and my defence; and until it has been removed by Act of Parliament, I simply claim its protection. To draw this appeal to a conclusion, my Lords, allow me to say that the mass of educated men, and of intelligent men in all ranks of society hi this country, have ceased to regard Avith any interest the average popular theology of our pulpits. It is</page><page sequence="152">152 CONCLUSION. because they turn from the doctrines, generally preached, Avith indignation and disgust; because their reason, their affections, and their moral sense are simply outraged by much that they hear. Speaking of the lack of liberty allowed to the Clergy, the Dean of Westminster says: " The Christian minister, it is said, has ' parted with his natural liberty.' It is almost openly avowed (and we are sorry to see this tendency as much amongst free-thinking laymen as amongst fanatical clergymen) that Truth was made for the laity and Falsehood for the clergy—that Truth is tolerable everywhere, except in the mouths of the ministers of the God of Truth—that Falsehood, driven from every other quarter of the educated world, may find an honoured refuge behind the consecrated bulwarks of the sanctuary. Against this godless theory of a national Church we solemnly pro¬ test."—Essays on Church and State, p. 84. But, my Lords, I-say it Avithout vanity, and as a mere matter of fact, that very many of those men who have been thus alienated from the Church of England have begun to listen to and to enjoy such views of God and man as I have endeavoured to set forth. Now, one of the most certain consequences of my acquittal will be to inspire the large majority of our intelligent laityAvith the hope of being able to resume their connexion and sympathy with the National Church. The clergy will then know, too, that their liberty is wider than the petulant cavillings of orthodoxy allowed them to believe, and the result Avill be that every clergyman, no matter what his views may be, will be believed to be speaking his own honest convictions, instead of being open to the taunt, as he now is if he is ortho¬ dox; of not daring to say what he really believes. Such a change, if it can be brought about by a</page><page sequence="153">CONCLUSION. 153 decision in this case, will be an unspeakable gain to all ranks and orders in the Church, as well as to every shade of true religious conviction. In short, if the question of the welfare of the Church be alloAved to have any weight in settling your Lordship's deci¬ sion in my case, I cannot do better than quote the words of His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, before Avhom I stand :— " Tf the Catholic Church is to retain its hold upon the heaits and lives of men, this must be by loyalty to that ideal of its woik and character which we find in the Holy Scriptures. What is this ideal It is that of a spintual society, united by spiritual bonds, and existing for the great spiritual end of making eaith more like heaven, and men more like their Lord. It is that of a brotherhood of manifold diversities, not limited to one portion of that world which Christ came to save, but absorbing into itself all that is gteat, noble, and true of all ages and countries, the soul of each member being the habitation of the Most High, and his body a temple of the Holy Ghost."—(Letter from Archbishop of the Canterbury to the Patriarch of Constantinople.) I conclude by pleading that I may be fully acquitted, and that the costs of the suit and of this appeal be granted me, on the grounds Avhich I have now urged, especially on the ground that in the incriminated passages I have only denied Avhat the Articles do not affirm, and have affirmed Avhat the Articles do not deny.* I beg to assure your Lordships of my grateful sense of your kindness in having listened to nry Appeal with so much patience and courtesy. * See Appendix D for the admission of the Solicitor-General that this " is perfectly true."</page><page sequence="154">k</page><page sequence="155">APPENDICES, APPENDIX A. Letter from Dr. Pusey to the "Times," 17th Nov., 1870. To the Editor of the " Times." Sir,—I Avish that Mr. Voysey had inquired of myself before he publicly imputed to me that I had imputed " dishonesty " to St. Matthew. Any one who knows anything of myself or my writings knoAvs how utterly alien such an imputation is from me, how shocking it is to me. But Mr. Voysey's statement will, through your columns, reach thousands who knoAv nothing of either. Will you allow me to give the passage as it stands in the authorized report of the Nonvich Congress I Avas accepting an argument of Dr. Prichard, that it is not necessary to understand the ten generations from Adam to Noah, and again from Shem to Abra¬ ham, as being intended to express the exact number of the generations, and so that they need not furnish a precise limit of the period during Avhich man had existed on the earth. My words were— " Is it clear that God the Holy Ghost meant to give us the genealogies from Adam to Noah, and from Shem to Abraham,</page><page sequence="156">156 APPENDICES. as exact measures of man's existence upon the earth? Prima facie, one should receive everything as it seems to stand. Nor do I see any ground of necessity for the extension of the time. Still, neither do I see any answer to Prichard's argument fiom the analogy of St. Matthew, chap. i. It is clear that St. Matthew, knowing (as he must ha\e known, even with a mere human knowledge) the succession of the Kings of Judah, omitted in one place Ahaziah, Josiah, and Amaziah; in another Jehoiakim, and in another probably Assir, so that he uses the word ' begat' of the grandfather, or the grandfather's grand¬ father, on the same principle on which St. .Paul says that Levi, the great grandson of Abraham, was in the loins of Abraham when Melchizedek met him. One ground of the omission of these generations is evident—to equalise the number of genera¬ tions from Abraham to David, thence to the captivity, and thence to Christ. The ground of this division is unexplained, but since St. Matthew used 14 as an artificial, not an actual number, clearly we have no authority to say that Moses did not, in like way, employ 10 (as it often seems to be used) as a mysterious number, aignificant of completeness; and use the ward 'begat' of a forefather, as St. Matthew did. What God the Holy Ghost did in one place He may have done in another. There are reasons on the suiface of Holy Scriptuie for thinking that may have been so." My object Avas to shoAV that, even assuming the higher antiquity of man, " the truth of Holy Scrip¬ ture is in no way concerned with these theories;" that those who held that antiquity should not allege it as contradicting Holy Scripture, nor allege Holy Scripture as contradicting it, since Holy Scripture, fairly interpreted, said nothing definitely on the subject.

Sir,—I hope nothing is further from my nature than Avilfully to misrepresent the opinions of another. I am sincerely sorry if I have done so unwittingly. It is quite true that the bulk of my quotations were collected for me, because in my country residence I had no access to a suitable library; but I say this not to excuse myself for having used quotations which I had not verified—for that no one can blame me more than I blame myself—but I say it in order to assure Dr. Pusey that I would not have intentionally im¬ puted to him a single Avord he did not say. On examining the quotation given by Dr. Pusey himself, however, I find that it does not differ in sub¬ stance from what I read before the Privy Council. He admits having said that St. MattheAV evidently omitted some generations in order " to equalise the number of generations from Abraham to David, thence to the Captivity, and thence to Christ." He admits that St.Matthew "used 14 as an artificial, not an actual number," or, in plain English, a false number instead of a true one, and that we have no authority to say that Moses did not use the number 10 "in like Avay;" and adds, " What God the Holy Ghost did in one place He may have done in another." I think if this be the recognised method of explaining the false</page><page sequence="158">158 APPENDICES. numbers used in the Bible, Dr. Pusey ought to thank me for accusing him of imputing dishonesty to St. Matthew instead of to St. Matthew's God. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, Charles Voysey. Dover, Nov. 17. APPENDIX B. ' • Letter from Cannon Liddon to the " Times," 18th Nov. To the Editor of the " Times." Sir,—Mr. Voysey is reported in your columns to have represented me as teaching that " the human nature Avhich He (the Eternal Son) puts on, is, as he (Cannon Liddon) expressly says, ' a cloak,' ' a me¬ taphor,' " pursues Mr. Voysey, " which scarcely ex¬ presses the inseparability spoken of in the Second Article, and appears directly contradictory to the Fifteenth." In another part of his defence Mr. Voysey speaks of me as " admitting" that " Jesus had no personality." Mr. Voysey refers, I imagine, to the subjoined passage of my Bampton Lectures (1st Ed., p. 386; 4th Ed., p. 259) :— " How can Godhead and manhood thus coalesce without for¬ feiture of that union which is a condition of personality The</page><page sequence="159">APPENDICES. 159 answer to this question lies in the fact, upon Avhich St. John insists with such prominence, that Our Lord's Godhead is the seat of his'personality. The Son of Mary is not a distinct human person, mysteriously linked with the Divine nature of the Eternal Word. The Person of the Son of Mary is Divine and Eternal; it is none other than the Person of the Word. When He took upon Him to deliver man, the Eternal Word did not abhor the Virgin's womb. He clothed Himself with man's bodily and man's immaterial nature; He united it to His own divinity. He took man's nature upon Him in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance, so that two whole and perfect natures were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ' (Art. 2). Thus, to speak of Christ as a man (at least without explanation, 4th Ed.) may lead to a serious misconception; He is the Man. or, rather, He is man. Christ's manhood is not of itself an individual being; it is not a seal and centre of personality; it has no conceivable existence apart from the act whereby the Eternal Word in becoming in¬ carnate called it into being and made it His own. It is a vesture which He has folded around His person; it is an instru¬ ment through which He places Himself in contact with man, and whereby He acts upon humanity. He wears it in Heaven, and thus robed in it He represents, He impersonates. He pleads for .the race of beings to which it belongs. In saying that Christ ' took our nature upon Him' we imply that His person existed before, and that the manhood which He assumed was itself impersonal." I am, then, so far from saying that " Jesus had no personality," that I assert His person to be eternal and divine. I used the word " vesture" as the Fathers use " instrument," and simply to express the relation of Our Lord's human nature to His pre- existeht person thus far; that He, being • God, assumed that nature, without change or confusion in His OAvn divine personality. The Second Article de¬ clares the perfection of the Godhead and manhood of Our Lord, as joined together in His one person. The Fifteenth Article declares the perfection of</page><page sequence="160">160 APPENDICES. His manhood. The two Articles declare the same truth as to His manhood; the second further asserts the perfection of His Godhead, and the union of the two natures. As these articles do not contradict each other, so neither can my statement, which is an ex¬ pansion of Art. 2, contradict Art. 15. " Personality," Mr. Voysey says, " is one of the essentials of our nature." True, in our mode of being, as mere men. But no being can have two personalities; and Our Lord's human nature, which is for ever joined to His divine, never had any existence apart from it. I must not trespass on your space further than to hope that the extreme seriousness. of the subject under discussion Avill be a sufficient apology for my troubling you thus. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, H. P. Liitdon.- Christ Church, Oxford, Nov. 17. My Reply to Canon Liddon, " Times" 21st Nov., 1870. To the Editor of the " Times." Sib,—After the generous amount of space Avhich you' have lately devoted to my appeal, my words in reply to Canon Liddon will be few. On referring to the printed copy from which I read at the sittings of the Judicial Committee I find these words:—</page><page sequence="161">APPENDICES. 161 " If Canon Liddon's admission that Jesus had no human per¬ sonality be adopted, then 99 out of every 100 clergymen and laymen are in the wrong.'' I firmly believe that I read those words verbatim, though they are not so reported in the Times. From the context, howevei', nothing could be more clear than that I was charging Canon Liddon with denying only the human personality, and not the divine. This is sustained by Canon Liddon's own letter to you in your columns of to-day. I am Sir, your obedient servant, Charles Voysey. Nov. 18. APPENDIX C. Letter from Sir Roundell Palmer, " Times," 17th November, 1870. To the Editor of the " Times." Sir,—I see that in your report of my statement and argument in the case of the Rev.

Palmer. 6, Portland-place, W., Nov. 15. APPENDIX D. Extract from the Speech of the Solicitor-General in reply to me on the 15th November. " Now, my Lords, I admit, as I admitted yesterday, that if by that Mr. Voysey means he has not taken the 39 Articles, and either put the negation of them in terms or asserted the logical contradictory of the various propositions contained in them, it is perfectly true. Of course no man in his senses would think of pursuing a course which would lead to instant con¬ demnation, and which no ingenuity of the human mind could for a moment suggest, even to the pursuer of it, that it did not involve righteous condemnation. But Mr. Voysey seems, as far as I can make out, to be of opinion that that is all he is bound to satisfy your Lordships of ; that he may say what he pleases,</page><page sequence="163">^ APPENDICES. 163 so long as he does not assert the logical contradictory of the Articles, and that when opinions entirely in¬ consistent with any view or scope of the Articles are presented to his view, that it is an answer to that * proposition to say that " the Articles no where present a contradictory of that, and therefore I have nowhere contradicted the Articles."
