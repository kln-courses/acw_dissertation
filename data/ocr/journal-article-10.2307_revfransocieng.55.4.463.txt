Agent-based systems have been in use since the 1990s to simulate the  dynamics of social phenomena. They help to conceptualize interactions between an  organized set of agents and to explore the structures that emerge through the formalisa- tion of complex situations where heterogeneous agents operate at various levels. This  article presents and discusses a conceptual framework which articulates the relevant  fields (empirical, conceptual, model) in a general way, and in the case of multi-agent  systems. It then develops an analytical framework to capture the various uses of these  systems, exploring in particular the methodological opposition between parsimonious  models (KISS) and descriptive models (KIDS), which could be viewed as different  stages in scientific investigation. Finally, it uses this framework and criteria to analyse  several examples from sociology, economics and geography (residential segregation,  educational inequality, the emergence of norms, market operation, urban hierarchy)  and concludes with methodological proposals based on an abductive approach to the  use of multi-agent systems in social science.  Key words. epistemology and methodology of social simulation—agent-based  modelling—computational social science—complex system—agent-based systems For more than fifteen years, agent-based modelling (ABM) and the simulation  of social phenomena using “multi-agent systems” (MAS) have made it possible to  conceptualize and simulate an organized set of agents interacting with their envi- ronment. They enable us to formalise complex situations involving multiple levels  (spatial, temporal, organizational) and heterogeneous agents engaged in social ac- tivities. These “agents” may possess more or less developed capabilities, and range  from simple reactive agents who, when they interact, may constitute a form of col- lective intelligence (Bonabeau 1994; Bonabeau and Théraulaz, 2000), to cognitive  agents with more or less sophisticated forms of rationality, as predicted by Herbert  A. Simon (1969). The use of MAS to simulate the dynamics of cognitive and so- cial phenomena has gradually spread through various social science disciplines  (Heath, Hill and Ciarallo, 2009). We would agree with Robert L. Axtell (2006),  that we have now gone beyond the “end of the beginning” and entered a period of  Translated by Peter Hamilton The authors would like to thank the Revue Française de Sociologie peer reviewers for their  comments and constructive suggestions.

These applications from various fields reveal both similarities, that are partly  related to the formalisation of ABM itself, as well as some differences, including  how to understand the phenomenon to be modelled according to the methods used  in the discipline concerned. In economics, for example, Axtell (2006) discusses  the use of agent-based models as a complement or as a substitute for mathematical  models with analytical solutions. In geography, Lena Sanders (2006) proposes a  distinction between agent-based models that aim to reproduce observed facts and  those that explain/or explore stylized facts. In sociology, Nigel Gilbert (2008) pro- poses distinguishing “abstract,” “middle range” and “facsimile” models. Flaminio  Squazzoni (2012) uses a similar categorization but calls the third category “case- based.” Each discipline produces models of these varying types, although some  “specializations” have emerged amongst different disciplinary practices. Right from  the beginning there have been pioneers of ABM use in each of these disciplines  (Amblard and Phan, 2006, Phan and Amblard, 2007). They are also found in ar- chaelogy, where—although data simulation was initially used—it is now the case that  “middle range” theoretical thinking about the form of social relations is becoming  important (Kohler, Gumerman and Reynolds, 2005; Kohler et al. 2012). In this article, we argue that these different uses of modelling lead to the devel- opment of different types of models, both from the methodological point of view  and from an epistemological perspective, and show how they are complementary,  rather than alternatives, in investigating social worlds. To this end, we propose an  analytic grid in order to clarify the nature and source of the methodological and  epistemological similarities and differences between the applications of MAS to  various objects and problematics in the social sciences. Our approach has three stages. We present a conceptual framework that allows  us to articulate the relevant domains concerned in social science research, firstly  from a general viewpoint and then by applying this framework to modelling by  ABM and comparing this approach to research trends in the social sciences. We  then propose an analytical grid presenting the concepts to be used to understand the  differences in ABM modelling practices used in the social sciences. This framework  and this grid are finally applied to the analysis of a few examples, some of which  are iconic, while others are representative of a thematic field with social dimensions  (including sociology, economics and geography). We conclude with methodological  proposals about the use of agent-based modelling in the social sciences. “Domains” of research and modelling   by agent-based simulation Agent-based modelling makes it possible to formalise hypotheses about interac- tions between the entities in which the researcher is interested, and to explore the  results of these interactions with other scales of observation by simulation with an  MAS.

The phenomena, objects and relationships that we perceive in the  world can be “conceived” in terms of agent-based models, and this ability to re- conceptualise has contributed to their success in the social sciences. Our discussion  of this approach proceeds in three stages. First, we describe the different domains  involved in social science research, and then we examine these domains in the case  of ABM. Finally, we compare the conceptual implications of an agent-based ap- proach with various methodological positions in the social sciences. The “three domains” involved in social science research Scientific work uses approaches, knowledge and expertise from several areas of  specialisation. Pierre Livet et al. (2010) proposed a framework articulating the three  domains shown in Figure 1. These domains may be regarded as the three vertices of  an epistemological and methodological triangle in which the activities of researchers  are located: — 1) The first “domain” in the bottom right of Figure 1, is the empirical domain.  This is where the information derived from observed phenomena is structurally  organised for a particular field of thematic interest. Not all elements and observ- able relations are necessarily taken into account. In this domain, observation and  measurement are the preferred approaches to spot patterns and similarities (clas- sification, categorization, statistics, etc.). The constitution of the domain depends  on observational practices (experimentation, data collection, surveys, etc.) and on  the perspective that determines how and to what purpose these observations and  measurements are implemented. This is the area where one “establishes” the facts  that are observed and/or “stylized.”1 — 2) In the conceptual domain, one tries to identify the factors relevant to the  phenomena of the empirical domain that are of interest, and which might be can- didates for explaining their genesis, structure or dynamics. This is also the space  in which some approaches consider the reasons for acting; their understanding, and  if possible the principles of their formalisation. The construction of a conceptual  framework involves identifying and defining the entities and qualities related to the  phenomena being considered, in order to analyze the relationships and transactions  that affect them, and thus as a result whether the proposed explanatory conjectures  make sense. — 3) The model domain involves a formalisation/implementation of the theo- ries formulated within the conceptual domain and/or observations in the empirical  domain, using a formal system that is assumed to be coherent and unambiguous (for  example mathematical or computer-based).  In the following, those we term “thematicians” are specialists from an empiri- cal and/or conceptual domain in the human and social sciences. Building a formal   1. A “stylized fact” is a simplified presentation (ie rate, ratio or difference, spatial structure)  of an empirical regularity, on the observation of which there is broad agreement. The term was  popularized in economics by Nicholas Kaldor (1961). From our diagram, the stylized facts can be  constructed as follows: (1) from the empirical field relevant relationships are identified; (2) simpli- fications are made that formally enable the inclusion of these relationships in models; (3) once it  is established that these simplifications do not distort things too much, these relationships—which  are both simplifying and formalised—are elevated to the status of “stylized facts” for which the  theoretical concepts must account.

Livet, et al. (2010). model for the social sciences involves establishing a relationship between the (purely  syntactic) formal model and the thematic conceptual framework that it formalises  and from which it draws its semantics. This latter is determined by a “point of  view” that denotes the question that is asked about the phenomenon of interest being  considered; by the purpose of this question, contextualized by the available means;  the rules which apply in the profession (the state of play in the academic domain  of reference); and/or paradigm(s) of reference.2 When building a formal model,3 it  is therefore an abstraction of the phenomenon of interest, which aims to answer a  question posed by a particular perspective. In the case of a conceptual model (i.e.  an explanatory model), the relationship with the conceptual domain will be empha- sised, while in the case of an empirical model (i.e. focused on the reproduction of  observed phenomena), it will be the relationship with the empirical domain that will  be emphasised. Some work is connected to only one of these three areas, indicated by the curved  arrow which starts from and returns to the domain. For the empirical domain, it is  the work of empirical development (e.g. qualitative studies or surveys, data analysis  and other quantitative processes) by which there is a constant effort to improve the  factual and also the conceptual content of empirical knowledge and its organiza- tion. In the model domain, the concern is to explore formal properties of the system   2. If one changes the context and/or pur-  3.

Other work is concerned with the interaction between two domains.  — Thus, the activity of the empirical domain is closely linked to that of the  conceptual domain. The entity formed by these two areas and their links can be  termed the “thematic world.” On one side the “facts” are always constructed and  “theory laden” (Hanson, 1958), and the establishment of organized descriptions of  the empirical domain and stylized facts (meaningful regularities) are dependent on  the conceptual “background.” On the other, the explanation of these “facts” con- tributes to the formation of theoretical conjectures. The exploratory study of formal  properties of the models requires a connection with the conceptual or empirical  domains in order to make sense. For example, a social interaction model can share  the same formal structure as a statistical physics model, but the interpretation of  assumptions and model properties in the conceptual frameworks of reference is of  course different (see, for example, Kindermann and Snell, 1980; Phan, Gordon and  Nadal, 2004; Phan, 2013b; etc.). — The interaction between the empirical and model domains is favoured in other  approaches which thus adopt models based on description: the model parameters are  calibrated from observed facts, expertise or by statistical estimation. In this case,  some authors claim to be able to “validate” the model solely because of its ability  to reproduce the observed facts (see Amblard, Rouchier and Bommel, [2006] for a  review). Such an approach may be misleading, both because of the logical limits of  induction, but also because the correlation may be coincidental, and “predict not  explain” (Thom, 1993, see also Aubin, 2004), especially in the case of complex  systems.4 Conversely, moving from the model domain to the empirical domain, the  “traces” of a simulation run by MAS can also be considered as ‘data’ generated in  silico and analyzed as such with the methods in use in the empirical domain, in the  same way as records of observations made of empirical phenomena. — A third type of relationship concerns the conceptual and model domains.  The meaning of the formal (syntactic) model is given in the conceptual domain, on  the basis of a background conceptual framework5 and a perspective specific to the  problem considered. We describe the entity thus constituted as the “model sphere”  which supports a particular representation of the domain of reference of the real  world, that we can denote as the “model world” (Sugden, 2002).. By specifying the  generic relationships of the conceptual framework, the formal model allows syntac- tic exploration (analytically or by simulation) of the properties of that particular  formalisation of the model. This formal exploration can prove the internal consist- ency and robustness of this particular formalisation, but does not enable us to infer  the “validity” or “invalidity” of the conceptual framework of which this model is a  particular expression.  4.

In what follows, we go deeper into these relations in  the case of modelling by MAS. Application of the “three domains” framework   to agent-based modelling and multi-agent simulation Applying the generic framework we have just defined to agent-based modelling  and to simulation by MAS in the social sciences, the domains involved are: 1) the  empirical domain in question, with the specific forms of expertise associated with it  (sociology, geography, economics, archaeology, etc.); 2) the conceptual domains in  which are articulated the conceptual framework(s) of the social sciences concerned  with the question being asked, the conceptual framework of agent-based modelling  and the conceptual framework for complex systems (defined below); 3) the informa- tion technology domain of MAS. In the social sciences, the design of an agent-based  model and the exploitation of the results simulated by MAS make it necessary to  use each of the three domains at different stages, as underlined by Gianluca Manzo  (2005). A researcher may be expert in more than one domain, but rarely in all three,6  although many field specialists programme the models they have designed for their  disciplines themselves, in particular by using “multi-agent” platforms7 that offer  easier access than direct programming. MAS are a recent information technology,8 which mainly developed from the  1990s onwards and implemented a set of concepts and techniques for relatively  autonomous software components called “agents” to interact within these systems  (Dignum, 2009). More specifically, an “object” is an information entity that is as- sociated with data (“attributes”) and processes (“methods”). An agent is an active  object, located in a structured environment, and it can perceive and process informa- tion on this environment, and communicate and interact with other agents (Ferber,  1995, 2006).  6.

In this perspective, the “actions” of an agent may be motivated by ob- jectives, and controlled by resources, capabilities and available information (Ferber,  2006, 2007). Some have even drawn on the analytical philosophy of action within  the “Belief, Desire, Intention paradigm (BDI)” (Rao and Georgeff, 1991; Georgeff  et al., 1999) and have suggested principles of learning, communication and reason- ing for artificial agents (Wooldridge, 2000). This academic field is the subject of an  extensive literature, but is mostly used by designers of the MAS platform, and much  less so by social science modellers, although this has not prevented reciprocal influ- ences occurring at the conceptual level. IT experts’ use of anthropomorphic meta- phors to determine agent architectures has not helped, and has in fact introduced  confusion and posed philosophical problems (Shoham, 1993). The idea of a “complex adaptive system” was proposed in the early 1990s by  researchers at the Santa Fe Institute10 to characterize systems composed of interact- ing entities, which adapt in a “self-organized” way to changes in their environment.  More specifically, complex adaptive systems are dynamic systems that produce order  through the composition of nonlinear interactions between the elements that make  them up (Weisbuch, 1989). Their macroscopic properties are not deducible from  the microscopic properties of the elements that make them up: indeed, “the whole  is more than the sum of its parts” (Holland, 1995). This is called “emergent” order  (Ricard, 2008). As noted by Mohamed Cherkaoui (2006), sociologists have played a  pioneering role in identifying the social science phenomena that are typical of these  complex systems. Besides the Weberian idea about the unintended consequence of  intentional actions, there are also the “self-fulfilling prophecies” noted by Robert K.  Merton, the “threshold models of collective behaviour” of Mark Granovetter (1978),  as well as models of “critical mass” (Marwell and Oliver, 2001), etc.11 “Agent-based” modelling developed in the social sciences during the 1990s in  order to draw on the potential offered by agent-based simulations. One can thus refer  to modelling “by” ABM. The latter, made up of interacting entities, have the char- acteristic properties of complex adaptive systems. In the social sciences, the ABM  approach enables us to formalise complex situations involving multiple levels and  heterogeneous cognitive agents engaged in social activities (Phan, 2004; Amblard  and Phan, 2006). This method makes it possible to conceptualize and simulate “ar- tificial societies” on a computer (Gilbert and Conte, 1995; Epstein and Axtell, 1996);  artificial societies that can reproduce complex spatial, temporal, organizational, and  social situations.  9.

As the agent is defined at the level of the MAS as an active entity, the conceptual  framework for agent-based modelling may refer to specific theories of action. For  example, the philosophies of action which are part of the “analytical” current gen- erally consider that an action is an intentional movement, which may be based on  reasons which one could for example re-build as a combination of beliefs and desires  (Davidson, 1980; Neuberg, 1991; Livet, 2005). According to this particular point  of view, the ABM approach makes it possible to clarify the nature of the relation- ship between the social environment of agents on the one hand (organizational and  institutional arrangements, relational and spatial structures, etc.), and the individual  determinants of their actions on the other (including a cognitive dimension and pos- sibly an “emotional” one in the case of agents representing individual actors). In sociology, while Nigel Gilbert13 usually takes a fairly open approach to differ- ent methodological perspectives in use in the discipline, Squazzoni (2012) adopts a  much more restrictive stance by placing agent-based modelling in sociology (Agent- Based Computational Sociology, ACS) within the perspective of analytical sociol- ogy (Hedström and Bearman, 2009). This methodological strategy allows him to  link ABM to those predecessors who also claim to be working within analytical  sociology (for the sociologists, Coleman, 1962, 1964; Boudon, 1970, 1979; Fararo,  2001; Granovetter, 1978; for the economists: Schelling 1978; Simon, 1969). In an  earlier book, Peter Hedström (2005: 87) claims, perhaps with excessive zeal, that  “agent-based modelling is destined to become the dominant type of theoretical for- malism in sociology” (see also Macy and Willer, 2002). This methodological bias distinguishes this approach to agent-based modelling  from all those which do not seek to adopt the methods of “structural individualism”  (Hedström and Bearman, 2009: 8), according to which the phenomena of social life  are explainable in terms of the intended or unintended consequences of individual  actions structured by interpersonal relationships. This is the case for those for whom  “agents” are not necessarily human actors, but, for example, organizations analyzed  as autonomous agents within larger organized systems, such as city-agents in a city- system for geographers. By coupling ABM with “structural individualism,” the approach proposed by  Squazzoni F. (2012) tends, conversely, to make the views of the sociologist con- verge with those of many economists practicing agent-based modelling (Agent-based  Computational Economics, ACE).14 As Richard Swedberg (1990) has claimed, as a   12  For a discussion see i.e. Marchionni and empirical domains of interest (social scientists  (Ylikoski, 2013). can study social relations and economists, mar-  13.

We should note, however, that the economists in question  are fairly marginal within their profession and their point of view is mainly, in  respect of the United States, found in the context of behavioural economics and/or  the Santa Fe Institute. Although the methods being used are rooted in the practices  of economists, the research areas are those of action and social interaction, and thus  fall within the social sciences. Robert L. Axtell, for example, defines his area of  activity as “computational social science.”15 For Squazzoni, agent-based modelling is a particular point of view within soci- ology, which places macro-social outcomes of social interaction at its centre (such  as the unintended consequences of intentional actions of interacting agents). This  distinguishes, he says, the ACS perspective from that of quantitative sociologists  statistically exploring macro-social factors and qualitative sociologists who “prefer  to investigate subjective experience of people” (Squazzoni, 2012: 134). The generic  question that matches the ACM perspective could be formulated as follows: “Given  specific macro circumstances [...] how does interaction between heterogeneous in- dividuals pursuing various strategies [...] and influencing each other, cause [these  macro-social regularities] that we observe in reality?” (ibid.). If we were to replace  “interpretation” by “simulation” in Max Weber’s famous definition, it would now  read as: “we call (computational) sociology a science that seeks to understand social  activity (using simulations) and thereby causally explain its course and its effects.”16 Some pioneers in the field (Epstein and Axtell, 1996; Epstein, 2007) have ar- gued for a so-called “generative” social science according to which “explaining” a  social phenomenon means simulating it.17 Interacting agents in an environment thus  generate, through a composition effect, the macroscopic regularity in which we are  interested via a bottom-up process. Thomas C. Schelling’s model, for example (see  below) can simulate the emergence of spatial segregation from the movement of  agents depending on the characteristics of their neighbourhood. Although such a  “generative” simulation can be seen as a necessary condition for a computational so- cial science, it is not enough to provide an ultimate explanation of the phenomenon.  Firstly, the functions of the simulation must correspond to a causal process (Conte,  2007). Moreover, this type of model makes it possible to identify an explanatory  candidate for this phenomenon, without this necessarily being the only possible ex- planation, nor even necessarily the relevant explanation in all cases. The extreme po- sition on agent-based modelling espoused by Joshua M. Epstein has been criticized   15. This was thus part of the title for the man-  17.

Macy and Andreas Flache in their overview of analytical sociology  (2009), where they prefer the broader concept of “generative mechanisms.”18 The similarities between ACE and ACS which emerge from Squazzoni’s over- view could prove fruitful in bringing together economists and sociologists around  a more cumulative approach in the social sciences. Approaches based on the action  and “agentification”19 of active units other than individual human actors can also  serve as a conceptual background to agent-based modelling. Although the back- ground conceptual framework of the analytical theory of action is not accepted by  all social science research approaches, other strategies for the agentification of enti- ties, drawn from an empirical phenomenon of interest or conceptual body of refer- ence, can be adopted. Indeed, if we define the computational agent of the MAS as  an “active” object in interaction within this system, it is only one (purely syntactic)  component of the domain model and, as such, has no “real meaning.” The comput- erised agent is in itself “without semantics” and it is only by how we define it in  the conceptual field that it acquires any meaning. Any “active” entity may thus be  “agentified.” For example, geographers consider that cities can be seen as “active”  agents in a city system whose dynamics depend on the interactions between these  “city-agents” (see below). It may also be necessary to “decouple” the action of the actor as an individual  and link it instead with a function, associated, for example, with a role in which  the agent acts in a certain context, or with an organization seen as an active en- tity. For example, the term “identity” as used by the sociologist Harrison C. White  ([1992] 2011: 6) might serve as a background conceptual framework to define a  “non-individualistic” architecture of agents in interaction. For White, “identity is  any source of action not explicable from biophysical regularities, and to which ob- servers can attribute meaning.” Again, multiple points of view can be expressed in  an agent-based model. For example, one could consider that the agent does indeed  represent an individual, but that individual is only the carrier of multiple identities,  a vector for his/her own action. We could also “agentify” identities themselves or  build them into an agentified organization, etc. Thus, Bruno Latour (2005, 2006)  uses the concept of “actant” borrowed from semiotics to consider human as well as  non-human “actants.” If actants are thus agentified, these agents will not be reduc- ible to a formalisation of human actors alone.20 Effectively, the interaction between  actants would thus be able to account for the social world without having to attribute  to agents/actants any “inner” anthropomorphic (psychological/cognitive/emotional)  dimension that is individually specific to each agent. There is thus no need to connect methodological individualism—in the sense that  it refers to cognitive persons of the individual human actor type (Udehn, 2001)—with   18.

Neither the nature of the agent nor its function are predefined  by MAS formalism as we may be led to assume from the anthropomorphic termi- nology used by computer scientists to describe them. In our view, it is the research  question, which is set within a conceptual framework specific to the social sciences,  which determines the properties to be given to agents. It is thus the answer to the  research question which should provide the agent-based model with a background  methodological and conceptual framework, rather than the reverse, although in prac- tice reciprocal influences are detectable (Phan, 2013a).21 However, whatever the con- cept of the agent that is used, what matters above all is that these agents interact and  that these interactions drive the dynamics of the system being studied. What are the foundations for agent-based models:  Descriptive and/or conceptual? Should agent-based modelling be primarily “descriptive” or “conceptual”? A  debate launched by the founders of the field crystallized this opposition around em- blematic slogans. For Robert Axelrod (1997a, 1997b), agent-based modelling should  respect the (military) principle “Keep it simple, Stupid!” (KISS) primarily to allow  a clear understanding of the mechanisms considered: “The complexity (of an MAS)  must be in the simulated results and not in the model’s hypotheses.” Other pioneers  in the field (Edmonds and Moss, 2005), emphasizing the capacity of models to build  knowledge from case studies, proposed reversing the perspective and adopting a  mainly inductive approach by banishing a priori simplicity: “Keep it descriptive,  Stupid! “(KIDS). A real controversy exists between these two positions, resulting in a substantial  literature. The KISS approach is advocated particularly in the journal of reference  in the field, the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS). We  resume here the main points of this debate, then relate them to the context of the  three domains shown in Figure 1 and discussed earlier (see above). As we have  noted, Robert Axelrod suggests favouring parsimony and seeking the simplest possi- ble model that reproduces through simulation the empirical phenomenon in question  in all of its complexity. For Simon Deichsel and Andreas Pyka (2009), modelling  work is focused on a question, and the degree of abstraction must be chosen with  respect to this, as the realism of the hypotheses is not a necessary condition. For  Macy and Flache (2009: 264), models must first of all be simple and “complications  must be added one at a time, making sure that the dynamics are fully understood  before proceeding.” The models using interacting agents of “zero intelligence”22  provide extreme examples of very simple models, which are relevant at the level of  the structure of interactions and effectively unrealistic at the individual level, but  which nevertheless have the ability to generate the complex phenomena observed  at the social level. Regarding intra-day variations, Bruno Beaufils et al. (2009) and  Iryna Veryzhenko, Olivier Brandouy and Philippe Mathieu (2010) and Brandouy et   21. In theory, the computer agent is an  22.

Further  studies without order books should then show whether other mechanisms may also  produce a similar result and if further hypotheses may change the results (Beaufils,  Brandouy and Mathieu, 2010). In the longer term, human behaviour again becomes  more significant and the addition of cognitive agents makes it possible to see under  what conditions this would change the existing results, but also to identify what  changes are significant or, on the contrary, insignificant. Such an approach thus  involves very gradually increasing the complexity of a model that is very simple to  begin with in order to be able to assess the effect of each addition. The KIDS approach, on the contrary, advocates immediately taking into account  all the elements involved in the empirical phenomenon of reference. According to  this perspective (Edmonds and Moss, 2005), agent-based modelling should be “as  descriptive as possible” and not simplified unless there is strong justification. They  particularly criticize the argument that many complex systems can be modelled in a  simple way: “this does not mean that every complex system has an underlying sim- plicity, but rather that the evidence for it must be provided in each case.” Although  they recognize that complex phenomena can result from the interaction of simple  behaviour, they state their doubts as to the usefulness of limiting oneself to the ex- ploration of simple interaction models. According to these authors, this does not mean “rejecting any theory” but “pro- viding a theoretical range of conjecture with a descriptive capacity as rich as pos- sible.” This conjecture is required to be adjusted iteratively, following the results  of simulations from one (or a family of) model(s); indeed, for Edmonds and Moss  (2005), “it is often not feasible to develop a single simulation to represent a theory,  so one may need a series of partial models or at staged levels.”24 We can see in this  exploration of clusters of models that the aim is to build upward gradually (even in- ductively) to a form of knowledge engineering which starts from “data” to gradually  construct a more general theory from the lessons drawn from simulations. From a  methodological point of view, this approach is consistent with the methods used to  explore data in the field of statistical sociology: in this case, knowledge is “led” by  the data; in the KIDS approaches they are “led” by the empirical data, but also by  data from simulations. KISS and KIDS thus follow opposite paths even though, in both cases, the initial  question is rooted in the empirical domain. To address the question of the relation- ship between the nature (the level of abstraction) of empirical phenomena studied  and the adoption of a KISS or KIDS approach, Arnaud Banos and Lena Sanders  (2013) combined this opposition between KISS and KIDS with the understanding/ reproduction of a particular fact versus a stylized fact. This combination allowed  them to highlight the specificities of different conceptual models and identify shared   23.

To go further in the comparison of KISS and KIDS approaches  and, in particular, to show how differently they structured our three areas of knowl- edge (empirical, conceptual and model), we constructed for each of them a table  cross-tabulating general/particular on one hand and descriptive/conceptual on the  other (Tables 1 and 2). For KIDS models (Table 1), we necessarily begin from observational (case study)  data that we will model. There is no quest for parsimony and we do not set an a  priori limit to the number of assumptions and variables. The realism of the model  and the reproduction of the observed phenomena are the main conditions determin- ing the credibility of the results. Proponents of this approach thus refer to “valida- tion” (through the data) of the descriptive models corresponding to the case studies.  The simulation and analysis of simulated data are the main objects of the investiga- tion. The model is only the basis for simulations and its properties (conceptual and  formal) are considered initially as secondary in relation to the simulated results and  their analysis. Once the local (case-based) descriptive models have been reproduced attempts  are made to identify similarities and build generalising abstractions. This means  moving from what Edmonds and Moss (2005) describe as “descriptive simulations”  (Table 1, D2) to “abstract simulations” (Table 1, D1). According to them, these ab- stractions should ultimately enable the production of a more general “theory” (Table  1, C1). While D1 and D2 lead to work on the axis linking the model and empirical  domains, moving to C1 means going back to the conceptual domain from the model  domain (construction of formal abstractions) and empirical domain (conceptualiza- tion of the corresponding generalization) simultaneously. The construction of what are known as “analytical” simple (ie. KISS-style) mod- els (C2, on the conceptual model-axis) is thus an additional tool for assessing subsets  of the overall system. It is never an end in itself; according to Edmonds and Moss,  such KISS-style modelling should only be an engineering approach to modelling  used 1) to examine a specific function in isolation for a specific purpose, such as  when more complex construction would be more difficult to control; or 2) to locally  correct a problem with a more complex model.

The  relevant axes appear in italics. For KISS models (Table 2), if the inquiry begins with an empirical question, it  does not necessarily require detailed empirical (case study) data; we can begin with  “stylized facts,” that is to say data already worked on both conceptually and statisti- cally in the empirical domain, to reveal regularities (C2). One would then produce  a “local” conjecture which would serve as the basis for the construction of a model  with theoretical aims (understanding and explanation). The main objectives are to in- vestigate and understand candidate mechanisms to explain “stylized facts.” Both the  parsimony of the model and the generality of the results are important. According  to Axelrod, one should consider more complex configurations “only [...] if a simpler  one is inadequate” in order to obtain the desired results. To a certain extent the properties of the model are the main object of the inves- tigation. Simulations only intervene to establish those properties. The approach is  similar to that of a hypothetical-deductive model, but there is generally no analytical  evidence to evaluate the properties of the model: that is precisely why one simulates.  The assessment is then based on simulations whose aim is not to reproduce the  details of the observed facts, but to generate the stylized macroscopic phenomena  that are being sought. Calculation replaces demonstration in the evaluation of the  conjecture (Dowek, 2007). Secondly, one can evaluate the robustness of the model  to variations in its parameters or gradual relaxation or increasing complexity of the  hypotheses (structural change), by moving within C1. In this case, one is working  on the model-concept axis, but ultimately going “back” to the conceptual domain.  Unlike the KIDS approach, one may thus be in a “no data” configuration where the  type of conceptual exploration that is practiced (perhaps too readily) by economists  is more common (Hausman, 1992). But one must keep in mind that there is always an  empirical question behind the creation of a model, even though task specialization  can later lead to starting from a purely theoretical question (see below, with reference  to models of class emergence). Finally, one can also return to the empirical domain  by comparing the general model with datasets in D1. 476, Revue française de sociologie, 55-4, 2014 </page> <page sequence="15"> Pierre Livet, Denis Phan, Lena SanderS It is interesting to compare the views of the authors who defend KISS and the  abductive approach25 (in its widest sense), particularly as regards the link between  empirical observations and theoretical conjectures. Thus, for Deichsel and Pyka  (2009): “Theories do not emerge out of empirical description. Modelling is neces- sarily a creative process,” (of a conceptual order). Thomas Brenner and Claudia  Werker (2009), state that simulation fosters round trips between conjecture and con- sequences, “this should not lead to the conclusion that we must begin with a highly  complex model [...], abduction does not imply the use of hypotheses that are as  realistic as possible but rather to study data that is as detailed as possible in order to  establish stylized facts that can be used to empirically evaluate theories.” Establishing stylized facts helps in understanding what abduction means in the  practice of modelling (a back-and-forth process between D2 and C2): in effect, col- lecting similar facts together within a simplified diagram. To explain them one then  proposes a conjecture or hypothesis from which conclusions can be drawn. These  are then subjected to an empirical test. Negative results lead to reformulation of  a new hypothesis (abduction in the narrow sense), while positive results decrease  doubt and increase our confidence in the conjecture. But this remains provisional.  This approach differs from the “nomological” induction criticised by David Hume  because it does not mean generalizing from observations, but instead forming rel- evant conjectures from these observations (as the doctor does with symptoms) and  then submitting this conjecture to the test of facts. It is in this “broad” sense that  Swedberg (2012, p.1) interprets the Charles S. Pierce lecture “How to theorize”  (1903): “To theorize properly in an empirical science like sociology, one must start  by observing and then, on the basis of empirical material, suggest a theory that can  explain the observed phenomenon.”  Very diverse scientific communities thus use ABM in accordance with ap- proaches that are more or less rooted in empirical, conceptual and formal (model)  domains. For some, the main role of ABM is to provide a conceptual tool which  helps in the development of theories. For others, it is a privileged formalism used to  explore the consequences of different explanatory hypotheses about the emergence  of a phenomenon, by either comparing them, or not, with empirical observations.  This diversity reflects the scientific complementarities illustrated in the next section  by examples of applications selected from different social science disciplines.  25. According to Charles S. Peirce (1867/1965), abduction is intended to produce conjectures and  thus hypotheses: starting from a surprising observed fact, a proposition P is formulated such that  if P were true, F would go without saying (as deduction will show), so we have a good reason to  select P as a probable hypothesis (Campos, 2011) (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/pei- rce.html). This is, according to Lorenzo Magnani (2009, p. 95–126), the creative part of abduction.  Next is the selective part. Since many conjectures or hypotheses can be put forward, one needs  to make a selection amongst them, and the selected hypothesis is then used for inference “for the  best explanation.” To achieve this selection, one can apply the ideas of revision theory and thus  decide to eliminate the conjectures that would question the regularities considered most normal by  our theories (Walliser et al., 2005). However, one might also prefer those hypotheses that are not  limited in their ambition to challenge, if one is more open to surprising outcomes. These different  routes are not easy ones to formalise. Revue française de sociologie, 55-4, 2014, 477 </page> <page sequence="16"> Diversity and Complementarity of Agent-Based Models in the Social Sciences Application of the analytical grid to families   of models “with or without data” Below we take some examples of ABM modelling from sociology, economics  and geography, observed and commented on in light of the analytical framework that  we have presented, which allow us to highlight the diversity of forms of articulation  between the empirical, conceptual and formal model domains. We chose not to focus  this diversity on the simplistic dichotomous opposition between KISS and KIDS,  but to select examples that highlight different forms of relationship between these  three domains. These examples are closer to a KISS perspective, even if they do not  explicitly identify themselves as such, which is essentially an abductive approach,  and even though the types of back and forth processes between the empirical and  conceptual domains are more varied. Before presenting typical examples from these  three disciplines, we describe the iconic model developed by Thomas C. Schelling  (1971; 1978) which has resulted in many variations, critiques, and supplements in  several social science disciplines. The emergence of residential segregation:   A seminal model, its variants and an alternative Schelling’s model illustrates a basic principle of agent-based modelling: the for- malisation of interactions within a set of agents can be used to simulate the emer- gence of a form of spatial organization that was not “wanted/intended” by these  agents. It thus reflects the composition effects of individual behaviour that is not  coordinated at the overall level but is mutually interdependent. Although this was  not originally a model simulated by MAS, the appearance of models using cellular  automata in the 1980s and then MAS in the 1990s, made it into a “paradigmatic”  reference in the field (see, for example, Gilbert, 2006). The principle of this model  is simple: “agents” of two different colours, representing households, are placed on  a grid (a chessboard in the reference model). They only choose to change where  they live if their fellows become a significant minority in their “neighbourhood.”  In the initial model, the homogeneous configuration where neighbours of a differ- ent colour alternate (like the colours of the chessboard squares) is a locally stable  configuration, but it becomes highly unstable when it is disturbed. The system then  converges towards a “segregated” configuration where agents of the same colour are  grouped into clusters. If the approach is seen in the context of our three domains, Schelling begins  with an empirical question: how can we explain the formation and persistence of  racial segregation in the urban habitat, as can be observed in major US cities? He  then offers the conjecture that this phenomenon can be explained parsimoniously  by a limited set of causal factors26 that boil down to individual local agents’ pref- erences concerning their neighbourhood. This conjecture falls within the concep- tual domain and Schelling uses concepts of preference and neighbourhood at the   26. This does not mean that these are the only possible explanatory factors nor that there is ac- tually a main causal factor in the empirical phenomenon considered. The aim is only to show, by  using the model, that these are possible explanatory candidates. Finally, what is “tested” in this  process are “conditions of possibility” and not the explanatory hypothesis itself. 478, Revue française de sociologie, 55-4, 2014 </page> <page sequence="17"> Pierre Livet, Denis Phan, Lena SanderS individual level, an approach that can be seen as a criticism of generally accepted  views that segregation is the product either of deliberate public policy, or strongly  segregationist preferences. Rather, “it shows that segregation may occur without one  or other of these factors being present” (Sugden, 2002: 115). A set of simple rules  for the moves of agents are formalised in the model domain. First performed manu- ally on a chessboard, this model has led to the development of many versions using  cellular automata or MAS. This model remains “KISS” but, although it is strongly  “conceptual,” the original version is not located at a high level of generality (Table 2,  C2), due to these specific hypotheses about behaviour and the organization of space. Schelling’s model gave rise to an extremely abundant literature and many de- velopments (including critical ones) that we will not list here. Instead we will limit  ourselves to a few examples that contribute to the formation of a family of models  of varying generality as well as empirical content. Some studies have focused on  the formal properties of the model (C1). The geographers Éric Daudé and Patrice  Langlois (2006) have studied the behaviour of this model in terms of the space varia- tions of its parameters and demonstrated the existence of threshold effects. It thus re- quires a certain density of agents for a self-organizing process to be triggered. Below  a certain threshold, contacts between agents are too low for the “domino effect”  to be maintained. Above a certain critical density, localized interactions between  agents become sufficiently numerous for the whole set to become self-organizing.  In this context, other critical thresholds can be identified. The best known and most  interesting one highlighted by Schelling is the emergence of segregated spatial struc- tures despite agents being individually “tolerant.” Other studies have tested the robustness of the model when applied to a more  realistic, heterogeneous and structured environment. This can be done theoretically,  in a process falling within the “domain model” in interaction with the conceptual  domain, by testing spatial configurations with varied properties (C1). Thus Arnaud  Banos (2012), has tested the sensitivity of the model to various theoretical networks  creating different forms of neighbourhood. Other theoretical extensions have been  obtained from the interaction with the conceptual domain, by introducing more  general economic or sociological behaviour. Thus, Romans Pancs and Nicolaas J.  Vriend (2007) and Arnout Van de Rijt, Michael W. Macy and David Siegel (2009)  have explored new forms of preference functions. Alan P. Kirman (2010) has added  economic behaviour related to real-estate prices, which brings new results where the  richest agents of the least rich “colour” on average, are located at the border of areas  occupied by agents of the colour which is on average the wealthiest. Other work,  more focused on the interaction between the model and conceptual domains, com- pared the generic properties of the models in terms of social and physical semantics  (Vincovik and Kirman, 2006; Gauvin, Vannimenus and Nadal, 2009; etc.). The gen- erality and robustness of the reference model were extended in a purely theoretical  way by conceptual and formal exploration of its generic properties, without resorting  to the use of empirical data. We would like to stress the value of the exercise: a good  knowledge of the generic properties of the model avoids controversies related to poor  evaluation of the latter and/or use of an insufficiently general variant.27 Robustness   27. The article by Elizabeth Bruch and Robert D. Mare (2006), which describes a continuous  and linear preference function rather than a threshold function in their segregation model, might  illustrate this. Their experiment led to a result without segregation. But A. Van de Rijt et al.  (2009) showed that Bruch and Mare had overlooked a crucial parameter. By examining a variety Revue française de sociologie, 55-4, 2014, 479 </page> <page sequence="18"> Diversity and Complementarity of Agent-Based Models in the Social Sciences can also be evaluated in interaction with the empirical domain (Table 2, D1), by  locating the model within the observed morphology of a real city, such as the exam- ple of the REMUS model for the city of Pau (Moreno, Badariotti and Banos 2009). While the Schelling model emphasizes the final situation that the simulation  leads to, other authors have been interested in following the whole dynamic of segre- gation over time. Itzhak Benenson, Itzhak Omer and Erez Hatna (2002) have studied  the residential segregation of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim Arab populations of  Yaffo (Jaffa), a neighbourhood in the metropolitan area of  Tel Aviv, and propose a  model to account for developments relating to these three groups between 1955 and  1995. In their article, the authors do not refer to Schelling and the term segregation  is only used in the analysis of simulation results. Instead, they build on the concept  of residential dissonance. The presentation of the state of the art illustrates the  privileged position of the authors in the model domain. From the introduction and  well before addressing the problematic from a thematic point of view, the article  highlights the utility offered by the use of cellular automata and MAS to model ur- ban dynamics, compared to traditional mathematical urban models. They propose an  entity-based model, formalising the city on the basis of two interacting layers. The  first includes immobile urban components, that is to say, plots, houses and street seg- ments, and the second contains the residents of the town who are mobile and decide  on their spatial moves, according to a dynamic described by an agent-based model. The authors then bring the “conceptual domain” into play via a discussion of  the concept of residential dissonance, stipulating that the probability of leaving a  home increases, and that of occupying a vacant home decreases, when the difference  between the profile of an agent and that of its neighbours and/or its neighbourhood  increases. They propose seeing this dissonance as multifactorial, the measurement  of the overall residential dissonance resulting from a combination of particular dis- sonances. The basic parameters of the model are the weights given to each of the  dissonance factors in the overall measure. The “empirical domain” is then described, the authors proposing to apply this  model to the neighbourhood of Jaffa. They point to previous empirical studies that  have shown that two factors were particularly discriminating in residential choices  of the inhabitants of Jaffa: —The cultural group (of three types: Jewish, Christian Arab and Muslim Arab)  dominant in the neighbourhood. —The architectural style (of two types, oriental style and “blocks”). Two residential dissonance factors are considered in the application: the disso- nance between the properties of an agent (cultural group) and those of their residen- tial building (styles known as oriental/blocks, the former being preferred by Jewish  Israelis and the second by Arab Israelis) or between those of an agent and those of  neighbouring agents. Empirical studies, based on surveys, helped to qualitatively  (note 27 continued) of continuous and threshold preference functions they extended the model. This enabled them  to show that the absence of segregation, when preferences are continuous, could only arise if  the choice of neighbourhood was sufficiently random such that agents might find themselves in  their least-preferred location (which is possible when the location choices are random). We find  a similar debate in L’Année sociologique where an article by Michel Forsé and Maxime Parodi  (2010) was criticized by Meredith Rolfe (2010) and Alan P. Kirman (2010) (based on Vincovik and  Kirman, 2006). 480, Revue française de sociologie, 55-4, 2014 </page> <page sequence="19"> Pierre Livet, Denis Phan, Lena SanderS describe the degree of dissonance felt for non-preferred architectural styles or for  neighbourhoods composed of agents of another cultural group.28 The MAS thus formalises the residential choice of agents from a set of rules  about the housing characteristics of the home and of neighbouring homes, and those  of the population of the neighbourhood. In a case where no dissonance factor inter- venes in residential choices, the simulated proportion of Arabs in the total popula- tion in 1995 is greatly underestimated. This is also the case when only the effect of  the human neighbourhood is taken into account. When only the architectural effect  is taken into account, the simulations lead to an unrealistic result, comprising pe- riods of coexistence between Israeli Jews and Arabs in the same buildings, a result  which contradicts empirical fact. Only the simultaneous consideration of the two  factors of dissonance can reproduce the observed evolution of the part of the Arab  population in the total population of Jaffa in the period, and its level of segregation  (measured by a coefficient of spatial autocorrelation). The strategy of presentation by  the authors thus moves from C1 to D1 in Table 2, taking a balanced route through  the three domains. Two sociological approaches: Simulation to understand   mechanisms at work in the social world Michael W. Macy, who pioneered the simulation of complex social phenomena  in sociology, became a practitioner and advocate of agent-based models in the social  sciences. He began to study complex social phenomena (cooperation, co-evolution)  with genetic algorithms and neural networks (Macy, 1996; Macy and Skvoretz,  1998; etc.), and more recently has focused on local interactions of agents in non- homogeneous networks, such as “small world” networks (Flache and Macy, 2011;  Barash, Cameron and Macy, 2012). We will comment here on the article published  in 2005 in the special issue of the American Journal of Sociology devoted to agent- based simulation models (Centola, Willer and Macy, 2005). This article is primar- ily a conceptual exploration of questions of sociological theory, with interactions  between the conceptual domain and the model domain, without being calibrated on  empirical data, as indeed are most of the models from the same author. This is, as  emphasized in the conclusion, a “theoretically focused” approach. The starting point  is the question of the appearance and/or persistence of standards which are socially  self-reinforced by conformist behaviour, but which are individually inadequate, false  or inappropriate. It is symbolized by the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale “The  Emperor’s New Clothes,” where two crooks sell a sovereign a (non-existent) beau- tiful suit of clothes “that only intelligent people could see.” When the Emperor  presents his extraordinary outfit to his ministers and his people, everyone claims to  see and admire the clothes, except a little boy who naively points out the truth, that  “the Emperor has no clothes!” The first part of the article identifies the empirical domain studies describing so- cial phenomena of this type, referred to as “pluralistic ignorance” (when the majority  of members of a group reject a norm, but think—wrongly—that others accept it). The  conceptual question is thus set out as follows: “Why do people apply a norm publicly   28. For a Jewish culture agent, for example, the dissonance is stronger with Arab Muslim agents  than with Arab Christian agents.

Nash equilibrium29) and to evolutionary game theory (where rationality  assumptions have been abandoned). They justify the use of simulation rather than  the mathematical analysis methods used by game theorists by the value of studying  the processes and situations of non-homogeneous local interactions. This methodo- logical choice is found in many studies within computational sociology. The object  of interest is common to both economists and sociologists, but while the former  prefer solvable analytical models and focus on the study of equilibria and on simula- tion as a “complement” to explore situations where the models are not solvable (e.g.  the model of Axtell, Epstein and Young, 2001, see below), the latter immediately  consider simulation as a “substitute” for analytical methods and place more emphasis  on exploring the processes involved in less simple interaction configurations. This  stance is justified in the article (p. 1015) by a quote from Andrew Abbott (1998: 176– 7): “(analytical) game theory will not get us very far because it is ignorant, except  in the most general terms, of a serious concern with structure and with complex  temporal effects. But simulation may help us understand the limits and possibilities  of certain kinds of interactional fields, and that would be profoundly sociological  knowledge.” Applying this principle, the authors digitally explore the behaviour of  interacting agents in non-homogeneous networks. More specifically, they start from  a regular local neighbourhood network forming a torus and change its structure  to create more irregular neighbourhoods, either locally (Voronoi diagrams, already  used by Andreas Flache and Rainer Hegselmann [2001]), or at longer range, by ap- plying the rules of “small worlds” scale invariance of Duncan J. Watts and Steven  H. Strogatz (1998), whose kinship with the “weak ties” of Mark Granovetter (1973)  is emphasized.30  The authors then proceed to three kinds of experiments. The first assesses the  respective effects of local structures and the global and homogeneous distribution  of neighbourhoods (population completely or randomly connected). The authors  show that beyond a minimum threshold of believers in the norm it can spread in  a population that is predominantly privately opposed, but only if they are suffi- ciently established locally for the effects of influence to trigger a chain reaction.  The following experiments are used to evaluate respectively the effects of a change  of opinion among false believers and the introduction of a local non-homogeneous  structure. Overall, the enforcement of the norm seems to depend heavily on local  information effects. It fails to succeed 1) when agents are all connected and there- fore have good information on the number of supporters of the norm, 2) in a local  neighbourhood, where supporters of the norm are insufficient and 3) in a “small   29.

In these three cases, it is noted that the  results are fairly generic because they are widely associated with the (known) prop- erties of self-terminating structures used on propagation phenomena. This is a study “without data,” built as the application of known tools (mod- els) which are external to the thematic field, to a known empirical and conceptual  problem but one not solved in this field. The approach is close to the methodology  of economists, although it favours the simulation of situations of non-homogeneous  local interactions that are analytically non-solvable over the analysis of solvable  homogeneous models. The following example is closer to the image of sociology as  an “empirical discipline.” La spirale des inégalités by Gianluca Manzo (2009) illustrates a research path  located in a constant dialogue between the three areas of our epistemic triangle.  These three areas are used from the introduction onwards and structure the organi- zation of the book. They also appear, in greater detail, within each section of the  work. This is concerned with explaining the source of the social stratification of  educational qualifications. The model of interdependent educational choice (MIEC)  is developed to answer this question. The empirical domain includes a detailed analysis of educational provision and  educational inequalities in relation to social class in France and Italy, over different  time scales, in both a synchronic and diachronic perspective. The approach is com- parative, and the author describes, for each country, the distribution of educational  qualifications, the educational outcomes for individuals according to their social  group, and the social profiles of the different levels of qualification. The aim is to  identify patterns sufficiently structured to represent the explanandum. The conceptual domain combines thematic aspects, anchoring the approach in  the principle of rationality as a guide for individual decisions, and epistemological  aspects, discussing the meaning of a “generative” explanation. The author sets out  to provide an explanatory sociology based on a “generating model.” His position  is supported by both the sociological tradition,31 and the programme of “genera- tive social science” of computer scientists-economists (Epstein and Axtell, 1996;  Epstein, 2007). At this intersection, Manzo interprets educational stratification as  being underpinned by a complex adaptive system. The model domain is focused on ABM, presented as particularly suited “to gen- erate in vitro the processes contained in the systems of hypotheses recursively link- ing actions, interactions and structures” (p. 16). Generative assumptions are first  presented. These are individual decisions on the targeted educational level. These  assumptions are on three levels: 1) that of the individual in isolation, who makes  a choice based on the profitability of the different educational levels being consid- ered (which is perceived differently according to the social environment); 2) the  dependence of this choice in relation to the agent’s network of contacts, according  to the principles of “rational imitation” and “mimetic interaction” from evolutionary  microeconomics; 3) the form of relationship between the individual and the effects  of social composition that have emerged from the interaction of individual choices   31.

The formalisation of these various individual, relational and (macro) social lev- els, as well as the transition between them, is carried out according to a “temporal  projection” according to the micro-macro relational principles of Coleman’s boat  (Coleman, 1990). This sociological reappropriation of the properties of complex  adaptive systems allows the author to describe his approach as complex methodo- logical individualism32. The model-concept axis of Figure 1 is thus the object of  recurring interactions throughout the presentation. The simulated data are then analyzed via statistical processing, according to the  methods of the empirical domain, thus completing the circuit of the three domains.  This serves to highlight the type of educational stratification emerging from the  rules formalised by the ABM. The exploration of the results according to the im- portance of interactions between agents of the same social group shows the effect  of the configuration of these interactions on the educational stratification that is  observed both in France and Italy. This work, which can be seen as an application  of the programme defended by Manzo (2005), is now complemented by a study that  is more centred on the conceptual exploration study of the properties of this class  of model, which is located on the Model-Concept axis while allowing closure of the  conceptual domain on itself (Manzo, 2013). In this article, the author shows that a  version of the model that is both simpler (in terms of concepts and parameters) and  less deterministic (probabilistic choice) can produce the same macroscopic conse- quences. A similar path can be found in the work of the archaeologist Timothy A.  Kohler, originally part of an empirically based programme on the reproduction of  observed phenomena (Kohler et al., 2000; Kohler, Gumerman and Reynolds, 2005),  who now seeks more solid theoretical foundations by pursuing more conceptual  research, in particular using evolutionary theories of social relations, to give them  “generative” foundations (Kotbi, Reynolds and Kohler, 2006; Kohler et al, 2012.). Economy and society as complex adaptive systems Now let us consider two examples discussed by economists who are both as- sociated with the Santa Fe Institute movement.33 The first runs through the three  domains, from the collection of empirical data to formal modelling; the second  is a pure exercise in conceptual exploration, located in the “model world” (on the  concept-model axis), but raises important questions in the fields of both the theory  of social relations (returning to the conceptual domain) and the formalisation of  the phenomena of emergence by MAS (returning to the model domain—and the  computer-based conceptual domain). Alan P. Kirman and his team investigated the social functioning of the fish  market in Marseille (Kirman and Vignes, 1991). They modelled the behaviour ob- served with complex evolutionary mechanisms (Kirman and Vriend, 2000, 2001)  and later became interested in statistical physics mechanisms (Kirman et al., 1998,  Kirman, Weisbuch and Herreiner 2000). These models are designed to account for   32. Which does not differ fundamentally  33.

This behaviour results from a relational learning designed to foster re- lationships that have proven profitable in the past, at the expense of looking for  the most attractive price, which explains the observed dispersion. If we use a case  study as a starting point, the approach cannot be described as “KIDS.” It clearly  follows an abductive process: the study of behaviour in the fish market confirms the  doubts the researchers have about the adequacy of market mechanisms as used by  mainstream economists. So they develop a new explanatory conjecture. This is not  the generalization of empirical observations (KIDS) but is part of a hypothetical- deductive approach traceable to one of the two frameworks of reference: first, the  physics of complex adaptive systems, and second an expansion of the standard eco- nomic modelling to social and behavioural elements (heterogeneous agents interact- ing through networks, introduction of learning about social trust relationships). After  these preliminary models, the model’s properties were generalised, particularly with  physicists (theorists) for whom the exercise is part of their profession (see for ex- ample Kirman et al., 1998). The starting point was therefore an empirical question  and a “more realistic” description of the social market mechanisms revealed by the  survey. But modelling was carried out by using existing conceptual-formal tools,  which facilitated the conceptual exploration and subsequent generalizations in both  the conceptual universe of physicists (ibid.) and in that of economists (for example  Kirman, 1998, 1999). The example of the model of emergence of classes (Axtell, Epstein and Young,  2001) works exactly in reverse. It starts from a purely conceptual problem to reach  another conceptual problem and never makes the connection with empirical data  (“conceptual exploration”: a “loopback” without leaving C1). The initial question  is related to a classic game theory problem of a sharing game derived from “Nash  bargaining” (Nash, 1950). In this game, players have a cake of “size” 100 to share.  Each player announces a strategy (the percentage they claim of the cake) in a non- cooperative way: “High” (H) “Medium” (M), and “Low” (L).35 Only pairs of propos- als whose sum is less than or equal to 100% lead to an effective gain. There are thus  three classes of cases: those in which the gain by agents is zero (they all claimed  more than 100%); those where the entire pie is assigned;  it is verified that these are  the three Nash equilibria of pure game strategy36; and finally inefficient situations  where the whole cake is not assigned (Table 3). Of the three Nash equilibria, there is a fair equilibrium (M, M) and two unfair  equilibria (L, H) and (H, L). Assuming that agents are “rational” in the sense of  “classic”37 game theory, one cannot discriminate between these three equilibria. A   34 Markets of the “mutual-agreement” type  35.

In this game,  there are a large number of agents with limited rationality: they do not have common  knowledge and play their “best response” against an anticipation of the behaviour of  other players based on the observation of a limited history of their past confronta- tions. In addition, they sometimes play randomly (the “trembling hand” hypothesis).  This last assumption makes the mathematical structure of the game stochastic and it  can be shown that the only stable equilibrium in this context is the fair equilibrium  (M = 50%). Once this purely theoretical problem is solved, simulating this popula- tion game with MAS can raise new questions and provide new results. In the Axtell et al (2001) model of the emergence of classes, agents—divided into  two equal size subpopulations—are equipped with an external “tag” that identifies  them.38 They separately memorize the observed strategies according to the tag car- riers. Agents can then identify different behaviours by membership group and act  differentially according to the tag of their partner. The study of the co-evolution of  these two sub-populations makes it possible to identify regularities in the behaviour  of the sub-populations concerned, which emphasizes the role of external signs (tags)  in the process of emergence of (stochastically) stable social states. The relevance of  this study thus lies in what is termed a “class” regime where agents are “fair” to  those like them and “unfair” to others. This “class” regime was identified by pure conceptual exploration (C1) through  MAS modelling. From a theoretical point of view, it is particularly interesting be- cause of the interpretations it suggests, and also for the questions it raises. However,  it would be equally interesting to combine this pure experiment in silico with an  experimental economics study, and then to transpose the model to the empirical  domain (D1) on the basis of observed phenomena. There is no lack of empirical  social science examples of voluntary submission relationships (Joule and Beauvois,  1998) and categorization is a fundamental mechanism of social psychology in hu- man relationships. But one might also be concerned that the degree of generality of  the model is insufficient (the tags, for example, are exogenous). To go further in this direction, J.-L. Dessalles and D. Phan (2006b) gave the  agents a capacity to categorize: agents can link a tag with regularity of behaviour  in carriers of this tag. Beyond a certain threshold, they substitute observing the  tags for observing behaviour in their representation of the world (in other words,   38. R.L. Axtell, J. M. Epstein and H. P. Young (2001) tell us that this sign is initially “meaning- less.” The extension of the model (with endogenous tag) presented by Jean-Louis Dessalles and  Denis Phan (2006b) can help this troublesome hypothesis by giving meaning to tags (on this inter- pretation see also Denis Phan and Jacques Ferber [2014]). 486, Revue française de sociologie, 55-4, 2014 </page> <page sequence="25"> Pierre Livet, Denis Phan, Lena SanderS they associate a behaviour with a tag). The emergence of behavioural regularity at  the population level (“class” behaviour) feeds back to agents’ internal representa- tion (they change their “world model”). To put it another way, they anticipate the  behaviour of others not on the basis of historical observations but in terms of a  visible attribute of the identity of the agent, according to its tag. The macroscopic  dynamic properties observed in the simulations are modified by the ability of agents  to categorize their partners, and the “class” system becomes a (stochastically) stable  attractor in the model. This is a case of “strong” emergence (Dessalles and Phan,  2006a; Dessalles, Ferber and Phan, 2008. Livet et al, 2010) in which the observation  of a macroscopic regularity by the agents leads them to change their representation  of the world and their subsequent behaviour. There is thus a feedback phenomenon  from the global to the local level, which is also described as “immergent” by Gilbert  (1996).39 Agents gain autonomy in the sense that tags are no longer “exogenous” but  become endogenous (Dessalles and Phan, 2006b). They also gain in significance:  displaying a tag is an indicator of the agent’s desire to be dominant. Agents are  supposedly heterogeneous with respect to an idiosyncratic characteristic of risk aver- sion, and can choose by themselves to display an “expensive” tag, according to the  “handicap principle” introduced in 1975 in evolutionary biology by Amotz Zahavi  (1975), and Amotz Zahavi and Avishag Zahavi (1997), and then formalised as a  population game of “costly signalling” by Herbert Gintis, Erik Alden Smith and  Samuel Bowles (2001).40 A “dominant” class made up of the least risk averse agents  emerges in an autonomous way from a basic calculation of satisfaction that is purely  “internal” to the agents.41 Agent-based organisations: The example of city-agents Just as in sociology and economics, most ABM applications in geography for- malise (human) individuals using computer agents. Some applications formalise  individual travel, over the short term, or residential migrations, over the longer  term (Benenson, Omer and Hatna 2002; Benenson and Torrens, 2004; Batty, 2005).  Others use agents to represent more complex geographic objects. There are thus  “city-agents” who are used in SimPop models (Bura et al., 1996; Sanders et al., 1997;  Pumain et al., 2009) and Eurosim (Sanders et al., 2006; Mathian and Sanders, 2008).  These city-agents, who have the dual roles of producers and consumers of goods  and services, interact within a trading market. This set of interactions between city- agents is the basis of the dynamics of the associated system of cities, and can bring  out the spatial and hierarchical structures observable in the system, but which are  not included in the objectives of the city-agents. If, as in the case of agents modelling  human actors, we can thus describe the interactions in which these city-agents of   39.

These two dynamic models of cities (SimPop and Eurosim) are generic in their  conceptualization. It is based on the interweaving of three concepts: 1) that of city- agents, as coherent and indivisible entities, considered as elementary for under- standing a system of cities; 2) that of city system, based on the interactions and  interdependencies between city-agents of the system; and 3) that of self-organiza- tion, a property of this complex system which is structured (spatially and hierarchi- cally) through the effects of interactions. These three concepts are rooted in urban  theories on the one hand, and in complexity theories on the other, both within the  conceptual domain. Both the SimPop and Eurosim models are also similar in their  anchorage within the “model domain.” The MAS used are constructed in a similar  way around the same entities, parameters and rules (about how exchanges between  city-agents take place, and how their properties—in terms of population and eco- nomic specialization—evolve over time). The relationship between the “concept domain” and “empirical domain” is foun- dational in both cases. The basis of these models is a general empirical observation:  the recurrence of regularity in the hierarchical organization (rank-size) of urban  systems (Pumain, 2006; Sanders, 2010) and in their relative configuration in space  according to their size.42 This leads to a reliance on the methods and theories of  complex systems, where the rank-size relationship is considered to be the sign of a  complex system, and leads to modelling by ABM. However, the two models differ in  the way that the empirical domain itself is understood. The objective of the SimPop  model (Sanders et al., 1997) is to identify a minimum set of rules to simulate the  gradual emergence of a hierarchical organization of cities with diversified functions.  The initial situation is that of an agricultural population randomly distributed on a  grid. The hierarchical structure, observable at the level of the population system  emerges from the (trade) interactions between the elementary spatial entities that  form the population units. The simulations thus help to track the origin of spatial and  hierarchical structure. For the EuroSim model, the initial situation is that of urban  Europe in 1950. It is, therefore, a matter of grasping the dynamics of a particular sys- tem “in flight” and the questions are, as a result of that, very different. The challenge  is no longer to be interested in the emergence of a stylized or spatial hierarchical  organization, but to identify the factors leading to a possible change of structure in  the city system observed. The goal of the model is thus to explore the development  of European cities in 1950–2050, based on different assumptions about European  policies on openness to immigration on the one hand, and the existence or not of  constraints on intra-European economic exchanges on the other. The Eurosim model  makes it possible to explore how general mechanisms operate in a particular context. * * * After defining the areas of academic activity that contribute to modelling and  simulation by ABM in the social sciences, we posed the question of the relation- ship between agent-based modelling and the methodological approaches that can be   42. According to Walter Christaller’s theory, the optimal distribution of towns in a homogeneous  space assumes a hexagonal pattern (Pumain, 2004). 488, Revue française de sociologie, 55-4, 2014 </page> <page sequence="27"> Pierre Livet, Denis Phan, Lena SanderS attached to it (adaptive complex systems, structural or “complex” methodological in- dividualism, generative approaches, etc.). Then we discussed the relative priority that  modellers accord to conceptualization or to “description,” especially with practices  differentiated according to the use of empirical data. We emphasized that the meth- odological distinction between parsimonious models (KISS) and descriptive models  (KIDS) do not overlap with the division between approaches centred on concepts or  on data, but could rather be seen as corresponding to different stages of investiga- tion. The descriptive approach might be more appropriate for exploratory activities,  especially when a body of models adapted to the problem at hand is not available. The  adbuctive approach would be more appropriate when one already has a conceptual  framework of reference and where the evaluation of the corresponding model(s)— whether by confronting the data or pure conceptual exploration—leads to change or  refinement of the conceptual framework or models, sometimes in an iterative way. Some examples of the families of models taken from sociology, economics and  geography, seen and commented on in the light of this analytical framework, helped  to highlight the forms of articulation between the empirical, conceptual and model  domains. Although some approaches have managed to find a balance between these  three domains, we also noted the richness of exploratory activities centred on the  modelling—conceptualization axis, despite the lack of data. While ABM modelling  supports multi-disciplinary collaborations, we also observed that a single researcher  can move from one orientation to another in the context of a form of temporal divi- sion of work, and thus cover all domains; not in the same study, but in a succes- sion of approaches where one sometimes gives priority to the reproduction of the  observed phenomena, without implying a “descriptive” approach such as KIDS, and  then later focuses on conceptual exploration (i.e. Kohler, Kirman, Manzo, among  others). Thus, more generally, all the roads of our three domain diagram (empirical,  conceptual, and model) become increasingly valuable when travelled in different  directions in the development of an MAS model, because these domains offer a  wider role and contribution than that of mere formalism in the writing of a model.
