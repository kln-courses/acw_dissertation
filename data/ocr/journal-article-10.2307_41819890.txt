Reading poetry won't save the planet. Sound science and progressive social policies will do that. But art can allow us to glimpse beings that exist beyond or between our normal categories." - Timothy Morton, The Ecological Thought2 In his 1917 essay "Art as Technique/' Victor Shklovsky claims for art the task of awakening our perception and attention; art exists, he claims, "to make the stone stony."3 It is fitting that Shklovsky chose, of all objects, the stone for his example - he likely chose it for its mundanity, but from an ecological perspective a stone is a queer object, a nonliving thing that might be the composite residue or compression of once living organisms, often sharing mineral and chemical compounds with currently liv- ing organisms, at times enveloping the fossil remains of extinct species, and in future entombing our own. Stones seem inert, "mere" material, and yet they have the poten- tial to impact human activity and well-being in myriad ways. We need them far more than they need us, as the 2001 German animated film Das Rad (The Wheel) brilliantly demonstrates: from its stone protagonists' perspective, the entire history of organic life passes as rapidly as a summer squall, and the rise and fall of human civilization flashes by in a matter of moments.4 It behooves us, if not to think like stones, to think about stones (along with all of the other living, nonliving, and quasi-living entities with which we share an ecosystem) in new ways if we have any hope of addressing the ecological challenges we face.

And what is the shift in perspective necessary? The theatre is an optimal place for imagining worlds that can challenge the traditional binaries that have long governed what has proved to be a dysfunctional understanding of the relationship of humans to the nonhuman world, and in recent years playwrights have begun to write works that queer our perception of (what we call) "Nature" and align with an emerging branch of ecocriticism known as "queer ecology." In this essay, I explore the challenges that queer ecology poses for the twenty-first-century theatre and offer an analysis of the way that three such plays - Wallace Shawn's Grasses of a Thousand Colors (2009), Mark Rigney's Bears (2012), and Eric Coble's My Barking Dog (2011) - might be seen to open a queer ecological perspective for modern audiences. Queer Ecology The term "queer ecology" has a relatively recent coinage and is deployed in subtly different ways by different authors, so I begin by tracing its contours. In the introduc- tion to their anthology Queer Ecologies , editors Catriona Mortimer-Sandilands and Bruce Erickson describe the task of queer ecology as a probing of the intersections of sex and nature with an eye to developing a sexual politics that more clearly includes considerations of the natural world . . . and an environmental politics that demonstrates an understanding of the ways in which sexual relations organize and influ- ence both the material world of nature and our perceptions, experiences, and constitutions of that world.5 The authors collected in the volume explore what queer interrogations of various texts and cultural objects offer to environmental understanding, and, conversely, how atten- tion to issues of nature and the environment might inform queer theory and research into sexuality. Many of the book's contributors draw on evolutionary theory and biology to unearth an essentially queer nature that has been buried beneath several centuries of heteronormative assumptions imposed on both humans and the nonhu- man environment. So, for example, in separate chapters exploring sexual activities between nonhumans of the same sex, authors David Bell and Stacy Alaimo reveal how such activities not only challenge our heteronormative assumptions about the "natural life" of animals, but also fundamentally call into question both the distinction between animal and human and the separation of nature from culture. As Gayle Rubin noted almost forty years ago, in humans, the natural needs of sexuality and reproduction "are hardly ever satisfied in any 'natural' form"; queer ecology, this volume argues, would make the same claim of the nonhuman world.6 In Timothy Morton's hands, queer ecology takes on a more expansive meaning; where the contributors to Queer Ecologies aim to investigate how our conceptions of sex and sexuality influence our understanding of and attitude toward the nonhuman environment (and vice versa), Morton is interested in using the essential queerness of biology to provoke an epistemologica! shift that does away with the concept of 5 Catriona Mortimer-Sandilands and Bruce Erickson, eds., "Introduction: A Genealogy of Queer Ecolo- gies/' in their Queer Ecologies: Sex , Nature, Politics , Desire (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010), 5. 6 Gayle Rubin, "The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex," in Toward an An- thropology of Women, ed.

Morton writes that "[q]ueer ecology would . . . show how beings exist precisely because they are nothing but relationality," and that, moreover, because we are related to every other life-form, because we share DNA, we are always and already part of a collective: "We have others - rather, others have us - literally under our skin."12 Queer ecology demands a radical reconceptualization not only of who "we" are (as biological beings in relation to other living and nonliving entities), but also of what "we" have always imagined is "out there" in the form of a "Nature" that has never really existed in the first place, at least not in the ways that we collectively fantasize and encounter it. Like many of the contributors to Queer Ecologies , Morton grounds queer ecology in a close, robust (re)reading of Darwin and evolutionary theory. Evolution is both nonteleological and arbitrary - organisms do not adapt in order to survive and thrive in a given environment; rather, adaptations and mutations occur and, if they "work" (by not conferring a survival or reproductive disadvantage to an organism), they may be passed on to offspring and become phenotypic traits. Countering misconceptions, Morton points out that for Darwin, "the engine of sexual selection is sexual display, not 'the survival of the fittest/" and that sexual display is what "accounts for a vast range of appearances and behaviors"13 - that is, many phenotypic traits survive be- cause millions of years ago they aroused a potential mate's desire. Aesthetic display provokes desire and brings life-forms into intimate contact, generating more life. As Mortimer-Sandilands and Erickson observe, "cutting-edge ecological thinking under- 7 "Ironically, to contemplate deep green ideas deeply is to let go of the idea of Nature, the one thing that maintains an aesthetic distance between us and them, us and it, us and 'over there/ ... In a truly deep green world, the idea of Nature will have disappeared in a puff of smoke, as nonhuman beings swim into view."

Noting in this context that "[e]cology is the latest in a series of humiliations of the human," Morton points out that the decentering of the human will require a "politicized intimacy with other beings" that is "polymorphously perverse."15 As in queer theory, such intimacy rejects the concept of a norm with pathological variants; in place of human exceptionalism against a nonhuman world, queer ecology would conceptualize a multiplication of differences that constitute a mesh. Queer ecology - what Morton elsewhere also calls "the ecological thought" - has provocative implications for imagining both the human and the nonhuman in art, literature, and performance.16 In the first place, it asks us to think again about anthro- pomorphism. While, on the one hand, it is no longer tenable (and has probably been disastrous) to deny our continuity with nonhumans, on the other, differences among and between species do exist. Even though what we perceive as "boundaries" between species can only be perceived in retrospect, after evolution has done its work, those differences matter and we ignore them at our peril. How to hold our sameness and difference from nonhumans simultaneously in view? Complicating the matter are discoveries in nonhumans of traits and abilities previously reserved (by us) to humans alone, traits like language, imagination, reason, aesthetics, sense of mind, compassion, wonder, a sense of humor, and the ability to use tools and learn from mistakes.17 Even Darwin observed that "the difference in mind between man and the higher animals ... is certainly one of degree and not of kind."18 One way around these complications, Morton suggests, might lie in the implication of the Turing Test for artificial intelli- gence that what we perceive as human is an effect of performance. That test proposes that if, in interacting with an "other" hidden from view, I cannot distinguish whether that "other" is human or not, then the "other" would "pass" as a person. However, the most that can be determined with certainty from such a performance is that the "other" is "not a nonperson" - a category in which I can also place myself. But "not nonpersonhood" is an elastic, "eye of the beholder" category; at certain points in Western history many animals had legal status as "not nonpersons" (as evidenced by animal trials from the thirteenth through early twentieth centuries), and many 14 Mortimer-Sandilands and Erickson, "Introduction/' 39. 15 Morton, "Guest Column/' 278. 16 There are affinities between queer ecology and the emergent performance practice that Una Chaudhuri describes as "theater of species," which seeks, among other things, to replace the myth of human exceptionalism with an uncanny recognition of shared animality.

Within this conceptual framework, we might read, interpret, and perhaps more freely accept the attribution of what we consider "human traits" to nonhumans in art, literature, and performance - what is generally condemned as anthropomorphism - as acknowledgment and affirmation of their "not nonperson- hood." Queer ecology suggests we "treat beings as people, even if they turn out not to be,"20 not as a way of projecting human anxieties, dreams, and symbols onto other beings (anthropocentrism by way of anthropomorphism), but because of our ethical responsibility to both ourselves and them: "Treating nonhumans as people is a political choice that faces the vulnerability and responsibility towards other beings in which we are entangled."21 The challenge that queer ecology poses to theatre and performance studies is not "How do we avoid anthropomorphizing nonhuman beings onstage?" but rather "How can we use live performance to honor our ethical and moral responsibility to, and interdependence with, the whole extant range of 'not nonpersons' - beyond just the human variety?" Conceived this way, theatre, performance, and performance texts that fail to treat bears or goats or trees as people may begin to seem as bigoted and retrograde as performance that fails to treat women or gays or minorities as people. Another variant on queer ecology emerges in the philosophy of vibrant materialism outlined by Jane Bennett in her book Vibrant Matter. Bennett argues for an understand- ing of physical matter in terms of its ability to act upon the human and nonhuman world; she explores the way that matter is an "actant" with the power and potential to affect and shape both our physical environment and our bodies and minds. Ben- nett extends queer ecology's democratizing impulse to inanimate material objects by attributing agency to assemblages of things and beings. She suggests that we must raise the status of the materiality of which we are composed. Each human is a heterogeneous compound of wonderfully vibrant, dangerously vibrant, matter. If matter itself is lively, then not only is the difference between subjects and objects minimized, but the status of the shared materiality of all things is elevated Such a newfound attentiveness to matter and its powers will not solve the problem of human exploitation or oppression, but it can inspire a greater sense of the extent to which all bodies are kin in the sense of inextricably enmeshed in a dense network of relations. And in a knotted world of vibrant matter, to harm one section of the web may very well be to harm oneself.22 The emphasis here on humans' inextricable interconnectedness with the material world is simultaneously ethical and ecological in dimension. Vital materialism accepts self- 19 On the historical legal status of animals, see Peter Dinzelbacher, "Animal Trials: A Multidisciplinary Approach," Journal of Interdisciplinary History 32, no. 3 (2002): 405-21. 20 Morton, The Ecological Thought, 74. 21 Timothy Morton, "Ecologocentrism: Unworking Animals," SubStance 37, no. 3 (issue 117) (2008): 84. Queer ecology might be read as promoting something akin to what Randall Lockwood calls "applied anthropomorphism" - that is, "the use of our own personal perspective on what iťs like to be a living being to suggest ideas about what it is like to be some other being of either our own or some other species." See Lockwood, "Anthropomorphism Is Not a Four-Letter Word," in Perceptions of Animals in American Culture, ed. R. J.

Vital ma- terialism seeks to change the status of the "others" that have historically occupied the right-hand side of the human /nonhuman divide. Bennett writes that "[m]ateriality is a rubric that tends to horizontalize the relations between humans, biota, and abiota. It draws human attention sideways, away from an ontologically ranked Great Chain of Being and toward a greater appreciation of the complex entanglements of humans and nonhumans."24 This "horizontalizing" sounds a lot like Morton's suggestion that "we treat beings as people, even if they turn out not to be," and for good reason: both philosophies seek a radical democratization of humans and "others" by opening out our definition of what makes us people, to encompass all (of what makes us) people. From this perspective also, anthropomorphism begins to look less like an anthropo- centric crime. Bennett writes that [a] touch of anthropomorphism, then, can catalyze a sensibility that finds a world filled not with ontologically distinct categories of beings (subjects and objects) but with variously composed materialities that form confederations. In revealing similarities across categorical divides and lighting up structural parallels between material forms in "nature" and those in "culture," anthropomorphism can reveal isomorphisms.25 The recognition of isomorphisms - structural likenesses and similarities - has histori- cally been a first step toward egalitarian treatment, justice, respect, and moral and political accountability.26 Vital materialism challenges us to open out that treatment and distribute value more generously and more broadly, not because the nonhuman is in every way equal to the human, but because humans and nonhuman materialities participate equally in a political ecology. For Bennett, as for Morton, the hope is that how we conceptualize who we are, and what we are made of, might impact the way in which we interact with the material world: In a world of vibrant matter, it is thus not enough to say that we are "embodied." We are, rather, an array of bodies , many different kinds of them in a nested set of microbiomes. If more people marked this fact more of the time, if we were more attentive to the indispens- able foreignness that we are, would we continue to produce and consume in the same violently reckless ways?27 Vital materialism thus challenges us to think about how theatre and performance might raise the visibility of our "indispensable foreignness" and queer our understanding of what makes up and acts upon our bodies and our agency.28 Like queer ecology, vital 23 Ibid. 24 Ibid., 112. 25 Ibid., 99. 26 Cf.

Such a philosophical approach clearly makes an unusual and difficult demand on drama, a genre historically primarily concerned with human conflict. But the ecological catastrophe we have already precipitated (whether we are fully perceiving its effects or not) demands that we broaden out our understanding of what it is to be "human," and what constitutes conflict between humans, if we have any hope of changing cultures and psyches, as my epigraph from Bennett suggests. In a challenge to the longstanding dismissal of anthropomorphism as (bad) anthropocentrism, both vital materialism and queer ecology offer new actants for the stage - among others, nonhuman "not nonpersons," unseen microbes, the electrical-energy grid, metal - whose interactions with human people could create dramatic conflict that might help us imagine our mutual enmeshment in more concrete and politically efficacious terms. In the remainder of this essay, I aim to tease out the implications of queer ecology for the modern theatre through a close reading of three plays that are deeply preoccupied with questions of the nonhuman, of interdependence, and of intimacy. Each of these works, I argue, queers our understanding of ecology by horizontalizing relationships between the human and nonhuman and "treating nonhumans as people, even when they turn out not to be." Grasses of a Thousand Colors (2009) Wallace Shawn's play Grasses of a Thousand Colors takes its title from a made-up quote that serves as an epigraph to its protagonist's memoirs: When I finally awakened after a long, long sleep with many dreams, I was surprised to find that I was lying on a battlefield and holding a sword. It was just after dawn, the air was cold, and the ground was damp with my own blood. As I wondered what circumstances could have brought me here, I looked across the vast expanse of the plain on which I lay, and it seemed that I could see grasses of a thousand colors, in which many rabbits, in absolute silence, were leaping and running like small horses.29 Shawn explained in an interview with The Guardian that this epigraph, from his fictional Count D'Aurore, "warns the audience that the play will be about combat and struggle, while it serves as an unconscious self-warning on the part of the character, who has fought, killed and been wounded - but with only the dimmest awareness of the fact."30 But such an explanation curiously (and perhaps purposefully) elides the final sentence of the quote. The fantastical ecological scene that greets Shawn's imaginary Count seems a clue that there will be more going on in the play than just "combat and struggle" on the part of a human. The epigraph conjures a vision of the queerest of ecologies, in which, in the aftermath of human violence and out of the spilling of blood, grasses of a thousand colors blossom, putting on a spectacular display of aesthetic excess that, in the natural order of things, could only be aimed at inciting the desire and intimacy that makes more life and diversity out of life - a multiplication of difference as far nonhuman "actants," given its status as an assemblage of humans, material physical objects, and im- material substances (sound, light, words) (see ibid., 108). Scholars Marlis Schweitzer and Joanne Zerdy have convened a working group to explore these implications at the American Society for Theatre Research beginning in 2012. 29 Wallace Shawn, Grasses of a Thousand Colors (New York: TCG, 2009), 8. ajames Campbell, "At Home in the Dark/' The Guardian, 27 March 2009, available at http:/ /www. guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/mar/28/interview-wallace-shawn-theatre?INTCMP=SRCH (accessed 24 July 2012).</page><page sequence="8">572 / Wendy Arons as the eye can see. And among those grasses leap a multitude of (horse-like!) rabbits who maintain an "absolute silence" in defiance of, rebellion against, and, above all, despite the human's desire to impose meaning, identity, and boundaries upon them, humiliating him with their indifferent refusal to signify. In other words, the epigraph containing the play's title - which is quoted by the main character in the first few minutes of the play - suggests that this play is deeply interested in our awakening to the queer diversity and vibrancy of the nonhuman world. Grasses of a Thousand Colors transports us into a future in which the human relation- ship to both sex and food has been radically transformed. The play is structured as a series of monologues: the bulk of its narration focuses on the main character Ben's sexual escapades and adventures with his wife Cerise and his two mistresses Robin and Rose, as well as with a white cat, Blanche, who lives in a mysterious castle in the woods with a bevy of other nonhumans and who is killed and resurrected twice during the play, first as Ben's house pet and later as a suburban housewife. The play takes elements from a children's fairytale called "The White Cat," which is about a princess who has been transformed into a cat; in Shawn's reworking, the cat may or may not be a metamorphosis of Cerise. Much of the play is about sex, and about a world in which sexual taboos have disap- peared. In the first act, Ben (played by Shawn in the play's 2009 premiere at London's Royal Court Theatre) recalls the old days when people never thought or talked about their genitals, when parents never masturbated in front of their children, and "God knows children would never make out with their parents or fuck them, ever, because that would have been seen as utterly shocking."31 In the play's present day, by contrast, people not only mention genitals freely, but also include pictures of their genitals on their calling cards, and a high comic point of the first act comes in the form of Ben's extended homage to his "best friend," his penis. In this play, polymorphous pleasure (in the form of self-gratification, oral sex, anal sex, sadomasochistic sex, sex with animals, children, and in nearly every other form Shawn can imagine) is the name of the game. We also learn at the beginning of the play that Ben, a retired scientist, was instru- mental in engineering a solution to the problem of global food shortages; he tells us that along with a cohort of colleagues from medical school, he "figured out ways to create food where there' d been no food," primarily, it seems, by bioengineering ani- mals to live off of the dead of their own species.32 This technological solution appears to have backfired and engendered a mysterious ailment that renders most foodstuffs poisonous to people, causing prolonged vomiting that eventually leads to death. The privileged - Ben and his lovers among them - are able to hold the disease at bay by consuming a custom-manufactured "mud-like substance" as a substitute nourishment, but even this is, as Ben notes, "suspenseful . . . because [they] either felt much, much better all day than all the ordinary folk who ate the government-processed stuff, or, every once in a while, they felt much, much worse, but by the time you felt worse there was absolutely nothing you could do about it."33 In Shawn's dystopia, both sex and food - the vital appetites that drive us - have been voided of their natural and cultural functions. 31 Shawn, Grasses, 23. 32 Ibid., 11. 33 Ibid., 21.</page><page sequence="9">QUEER ECOLOGY / CONTEMPORARY PLAYS / 573 Grasses of a Thousand Colors is undoubtedly a queer play; it also clearly has an eco- logical message, one that can be nicely summed up in reviewer Michael Billington's words: "nature always fights back."34 But Shawn's figuring of animals as the "main dish" - in both the sexual and culinary use of that term - also prompts questions about what and how animals signify, and about the consequences of clinging to a fantasy "Nature" that only exists as a construct of the human imagination. In the course of the play, we witness the evaporation of the bright line between the human and nonhuman as people and animals desperately seek to satisfy their appetites with, and upon, each other. Here is Ben describing his first encounter with Blanche the cat: At a certain point in the meal, I felt the white cat's paw move onto my leg. Playing with my testicles humorously and slowly, she watched me eating the mice, a drunken, drowsy expression wavering on her face. Then somehow her paw had extracted my member from inside my trousers, and my astonished penis was completely enclosed in a warm coat of indescribable coziness, such as travelers dream of on snowy nights. When I turned towards her, all of a sudden she stared into my eyes, penetrating me so deeply and fully that I felt turned inside out. My God - finally. Finally, to be known, I thought, as hot sperm flowed out of me, flowing over her paw as if it would never stop. To be seen and known.35 As tempting as it may be to dismiss such writing as pornographic indulgence, a queer ecological reading recognizes that Shawn is, in fact, grappling with a more complicated problem - the problem of unlocking the mysteries of, making sense of, and establishing intimacy with, the nonhuman. The language here makes clear that what is at stake goes beyond the fulfillment of sexual desire; sex is rather the means by which Ben approaches what appears to be a transcendent state of connection with an "other." Simultaneously inverting both the heteronormative arrangement whereby males usu- ally penetrate females and the human exceptionalist assumption that it is humans who "see" and "know," the scene invites a consideration of what total interconnectedness might look and feel like. It is creepy and uncanny, qualities that Morton associates with queer ecological thinking, but also indescribably cozy. It may be hard to wrap our minds around the implications of such physical and emotional interpénétration: it is a queer ecological encounter that "warp[s] our psychic space."36 As such, the play's imagery brings us a step closer to grasping Morton's concept of the mesh, as it fantastically blurs boundaries between life and nonlife, organism and environment, and between and within species. A cat is a sexual partner is a wife, moving between the categories of life and nonlife and animal and human as matter- of-factly as the human characters move between physical spaces; mice are cat food are people food are pests; human genitals are worn like animal genitals and are call- ing cards and best friends; the inside becomes the outside, in the form of vomit and piss and ejaculate; and the outside penetrates and permeates the inside, sometimes pleasurably, in the form of a cat's intimate, knowing insight, or in the form of an erect penis, and sometimes painfully, in the form of poisonous food. The world of Shawn's play is one in which, as queer ecology would have it, "the boundary between life and nonlife is thick and full of paradoxical entities," some bordering on the magical (the 34 Michael Billington, "Grasses of a Thousand Colors," review of Grasses of a Thousand Colors, The Guardian, 19 May 2009, available at http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/may/20/theatre-grasses-of-a- thousand-colours (accessed 14 March 2012). 35 Shawn, Grasses, 35. 36 Morton, The Ecological Thought, 54.</page><page sequence="10">574 / Wendy Arons ever resurrecting and metamorphosing white cat) and others doggedly prosaic (the artificial, mud-like substance that has come to substitute for food).37 Moreover, in the world of Shawn's play, the microcosmic world looms large, as invis- ible species rebel against the machinations of their macrocosmic coexistants. Morton reminds us that "[t]he story of evolution is a story of diverse life-forms cooperating with one another/' but the play demonstrates the opposite, as diverse life-forms di- verge in decisive and consequential ways.38 Cerise describes this divergence explicitly: "the problem . . . was [not] just with the food - yes, the food had changed, but we our selves had changed, too, and in just the wrong way. The things that were there to be eaten had raced off in one direction, and our own poor digestive machinery had raced off in another, so whatever we could happily eat on Monday would start kill- ing us by Sunday."39 But Robin identifies the problem more clearly as a revolt from the inside out: "the tricks that certain people had played on frogs and cows in regard to their ability, for example, to eat their own kind, had not gone unnoticed by that whole population of smaller creatures, the bacteria and viruses whose sensitivity had perhaps been underappreciated."40 The play documents the consequences of human blindness to the consequences of our hubristic manipulation and exploitation of nature to support the survival of the human species, and it provides a striking example of what Una Chaudhuri calls "zoopathology: a disease of the ties that bind humans to other animals."41 But crucially, it also highlights the liquidity of ecological interrela- tions, bringing into hazy view the fundamental, queer indeterminacy of what makes life, and ecosystems, work. If, as queer ecology posits, there is no clear boundary between inside and outside, then it is only logical that whatever we "do" to or with the environment, we have already done to ourselves. And not just to ourselves. Toward the end of the play, Blanche shows Ben scenes from her recent life in a photo album. He tells us that I saw page after page of sort of - black landscapes, covered with - naked - ? - well, they were dead animals, I guess, cats and other animals, but the bodies were misshapen, bloated, the skin was broken . . . and as I looked at the album, she was looking at me, as if she wanted to see my reaction, and . . . - Damn - I knew we had problems, but I hadn't quite realized that the whole situation had spread so far.42 Ben's ignorance of the connection between human suffering and animal suffering echoes, reminds us of our own willful inability (or is it refusal?) to account for and fully recognize what we share with animals. If, on the one hand, queer ecology suggests that we treat nonhumans as people, even if they turn out not to be, then it stands to reason that the inverse also holds true: we need to remember that we are animals, and to keep that reality in view. Morton points out that "[e]very life-form is familiar, since we are related to it. We share its DNA, its cell structure, the subroutines in the software of its brain"; as a result, nonhumans "are uncanny, familiar and strange simultaneously. Their familiarity is strange, their strangeness familiar."43 Shawn populates his play 37 Morton, "Guest Column/' 276. 38 Ibid, (emphasis in original). 39 Shawn, Grasses, 70. 40 Ibid., 47. 41 Chaudhuri, 'The Silence of the Polar Bears," 46. 42 Shawn, Grasses, 86 (emphasis in original). 43 Morton, "Guest Column," 277.</page><page sequence="11">QUEER ECOLOGY / CONTEMPORARY PLAYS / 575 with such uncanny nonhumans - aside from Blanche, the sexy cat, we also encounter card-playing, pastel-colored ponies, a thin dog in a sailor hat who serves hotcakes, donkeys pissing in the castle's dining hall, and a hysterically crying little fawn - and their encounters with the human characters serve to underline our shared animality, in shared needs for sex, food, intimacy, companionship, play, and comfort. At the same time, the play offers a sharp reminder that our shared animality also involves a shared contingency. Cerise's description of the effect of the human catastrophe on the "mesh" is harrowing: she tells Rose of "the dogs' muzzles pressed into the ground, as if they were trying to bury themselves to stop the pain, as if their faces were covered with actual flames . . . - there must be almost a hundred of them here, pawing in the mud by the porch, trying to stick their faces into the mud - squealing so loudly that I can't think, I can't sleep, I can't eat."44 In the face of such suffering, the distinction between human and nonhuman dissolves, as the fate of any life-form intimately af- fects the fate of all others. The play's staging of shared animality stands in stark contrast to its structural and textual focus on the singular individual. In many ways, Ben's solipsism and narcis- sism shine a spotlight on the myth of human exceptionalism: his smug self-regard and self-love function as a microcosm for the human species' elevation of itself above what we term the "nonhuman world." Yet the final scene of the play cleverly undermines and subverts that self-inflation. When it comes time for Ben to die, Blanche tells him that while vomiting was awful, and suffering was awful, death in itself was a trivial process, the fearsomeness of which had been ridiculously inflated by generations of people who apparently had had nothing else to talk about. She herself had been through it a number of times, and it was literally nothing, she explained to me. Most things aren't alive in the first place, and they never were, . . . and iťs not particularly tragic to be a chair or a rock, and obviously the spark of life which occasionally flares up will inevitably go out, and iťs not a problem, and it doesn't call for a hysterical response.45 Blanche's words of wisdom connect to the queer ecological/ vital materialist recognition that the distinction between life and nonlife is a construction of human understand- ing, and that we can unthink that distinction, or think it differently. At the same time, her words remind us that when we take a broader perspective and think in terms of geologic time (rather than on the scale at which this play is written, which is the hu- man lifetime), a single life or death - or even the life or death of an entire species - is objectively trivial. Although the bulk of the play focuses, in typical hubristic fashion, on one man's needs and appetites, in the last moments it suddenly opens up our perspective to how utterly small and insignificant his needs and actions are from the perspective of the material physical world. The cat's multiple-lived perspective provides a spectacular counterpoint to, and repudiation of, the human's singular focus on his own centrality to every enterprise, including (and perhaps especially) species survival. Bears (2012) Bears , a comedy by Mark Rigney, takes up queer ecology's challenge to introduce into our awareness the category of the "not nonperson" that encompasses both hu- mans and all of the "others" whose capacity of mind is a difference "of degree and 44 Shawn, Grasses, 16 (emphasis in original). 45 Ibid., 88 (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="12">576 / Wendy Arons not kind."46 The play's only visible characters are three zoo bears: Growl Bear, an older male; Timmy, a younger male; and Suzie Wild Bear, a female who has just been trans- ferred to their zoo from another one. The action takes place just as human civilization seems to have collapsed in the aftermath of economic crisis: chaos reigns in the streets outside, food is scarce, and the zoo they live in is no longer functioning. The three bears have differing attitudes toward their confinement by humans, and this impacts their understanding of what it is to be a bear, which is one of their central (comic) preoccupations. Where Suzie is still connected to the wild, still mostly instinctual, and seizes the first opportunity to precipitate their escape from the zoo, Growl Bear has internalized his oppression (so to speak) and not only acculturated completely to zoo life, but has even begun to evolve human-like capabilities (he has taught himself to read and write). Timmy, who has never known any life but that in a zoo, depends on the stories Growl Bear tells him to ground him in bear culture and history; but Suzie' s arrival in their enclosure arouses "urges" in him that are inadequately explained or contained by Growl Bear's nursery myths. Once the bears leave the zoo, they have equally divergent relationships to the wild: Suzie is in her element; Timmy is an en- thusiastic convert to the new diet of grubs and insects (and to the smell of Suzie, with whom he mates); but Growl Bear refuses to disengage himself from what is left of the human world, raiding garbage dumps for food and stealing radios from abandoned stores to stay tethered to human culture and language. By play's end, Suzie has disap- peared into the wild, Timmy remains conflicted about where he properly belongs, and Growl Bear has returned to the zoo, where he and the zookeeper, New Annie, live in the bear enclosure in a mutually beneficial arrangement (she scavenges for food and keeps the generator running, and in return he protects her). Bears is a play about talking bears; it is a text that, in requiring human actors to per- form "bear," fully confronts the challenges of anthropomorphism for the stage. That the characters' "bearness" inheres primarily in the embodiment of the animal's perspective is clear from Rigney's directive that "the three actors involved play grizzly bears, but should not in any way be dressed in bear costumes."47 The personification of bearness that Rigney calls for here is one that seems to want us to be able to see the bear in the human (actor), so that we can view them as "people" in the queer ecological sense. That is, rather than projecting human needs, desires, and abilities onto bears - rather than giving us humans in bear disguise - Rigney's play tries to keep bear /human difference and bear /human similarity simultaneously in view. Indeed, the text itself repeatedly worries at the seams of what makes that difference: Suzie accuses Growl Bear of not being a "real bear" because of his obsession with human culture, his preference for the sound of a human voice on the radio over her, and his overly fastidious concerns about ethics and principles, but at the same time, even wild bears like Suzie turn out also to have a culture and a "code." Suzie's philosophy, that "[t]he world comes in three flavors. Things I can eat, things I can't eat, and bears,"48 works on one level as a statement of base-level bear-beingness at odds with Growl Bear's aspirations to find value in things (like radios) that bears cannot eat; but on another level, it can also be 46 Darwin, Descent of Man , 101. Bears won the Northern Michigan University (NMU) Panowski Playwriting Competition and premiered at NMU's Forest Roberts Theatre in November 2012; it will be staged Off-Broadway by Sans A Productions in March 2013. 47 Mark Rigney, Bears (unpublished play, last modified 12 June 2012), 2. 48 Ibid., 72.</page><page sequence="13">QUEER ECOLOGY / CONTEMPORARY PLAYS / 577 read as an ironic mirroring of human exceptionalism. That is to say, Suzie's philosophy indicates that bears are "not nonpersons" insofar as they also foreground their own species against a backdrop of resources (things that can be eaten) and the inanimate environment (things that cannot). Chaudhuri writes that to "make [animals] speak is not to write their faces; it is usually to write ours, to indulge that anthropomorphic reflex that is all too often rooted in an anthropocentric outlook/'49 But Rigney's writing resists that anthropocentric outlook. Humans are present in the play, but only as unseen figures and disembodied voices: there is New Annie, who is much quoted and discussed by the bears but never appears onstage, and a radio broadcaster who, believing that she may be the last surviving human, maintains human culture and civilization from her mountaintop refuge by reading Tolstoy and giving spelling lessons over the air. Humans in this play have a function analogous to that of men in plays like Clare Booth Luce's The Women and Maria Irene Fornes' s Fefu and Her Friends : displaced from their accustomed role in the center of the action, their power and privilege are made strange and opened to scrutiny. Yet at the same time, having people play bears must (or perhaps should) have the added destabilizing effect that staging those plays in drag might have, calling attention to the constructedness of the binaries human /nonhuman and person /animal in much the same way that drag reveals the constructedness of gender binaries. Thinking along those lines, we might see the doing of nonhuman in terms similar to the way Judith Butler conceptualizes the doing of gender: as an act that fabricates a reality and essence through performance.50 This is not to say that animal-being is like gender, in that it is historically and socially determined, but rather that as humans, we may only be able to approach the political task of conceptualizing the "not nonperson- hood" of nonhumans by imagining and enacting approximations of their scripts. Bears' deployment of anthropomorphism has the potential to queer our perception both of what we do when we "do" human and what we see when we perceive animals "do- ing" nonhuman. That is, the play highlights our inability to know and represent bear as it attempts to represent the "real" of the bear - an impossible task. Morton suggests that a queer ecological ethics is grounded both on not knowing whether [animals] are "for real" or not, and in glimpsing an abyssal Real beneath the simulative surface. The question of the political is inextricable from the problem of the political animal. Treating nonhumans as people is a political choice that faces the vulnerability and responsibility towards other beings in which we are entangled.51 Rigney's treatment of bears as people in this play takes up that ethico-political charge. The bears we see onstage will be people playing bears, likely people who look just like people and nothing at all like bears, but their lack of "for realness" is precisely what allows the play to make real and tangible our mutual entanglement, vulnerability, and responsibility. Bear and human culture, environment, and crisis are fully intertwined: in an ironic commentary on the impact of human activity on the natural world, the play 49 Una Chaudhuri, "(De)Facing the Animals: Zooësis and Performance/7 TDR: The Drama Review 51, no. 1 (2007): 15. 50 Judith Butler, ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory/' in Performing Feminisms: Feminist Critical Theory and Theatre, ed.

"When babies are starving, a zoo can't survive," New Annie has told Timmy, a statement that not only speaks an economic truism, but also suggests that a human society incapable of caring for its most vulnerable members has no business "keeping" animals in zoos in the first place.52 But the hierarchical relation- ship between humans and nonhumans at the beginning of the play is horizontalized by play's end, both because of the equalizing effects of the crisis (the few remaining humans must struggle to survive in the midst of a collapsed infrastructure) and as a result of Growl Bear's ever-evolving mastery of human culture and communication. In resonance with the way vital materialism democratizes the human and the nonhuman, in depicting Growl Bear and New Annie's cooperation in a shared political ecology the end of the play "draws [our] attention sideways, away from an ontologically ranked Great Chain of Being and toward a greater appreciation of the complex entanglements of humans and nonhumans."53 However, Rigney does not leave unchallenged his own use of anthropomorphism to make that entanglement visible. At the end of Bears, Growl Bear is alone in his zoo enclosure, painstakingly typing out his (704 page!) memoir on New Annie's computer. He has told Timmy that he is not just writing his history, but the history, from his perspective, "of the collapse of human civilization" in the hopes that "maybe someone will find it, years from now, and it will help them understand how the world was, and what happened, and maybe give them some sort of insight into how to put it all back together again."54 The idea of a bear writing such a history is so comically absurd that it is clearly aimed at provoking a recognition, in us, of how patently ridiculous it is for humans to project our mode of thought, analysis, reflection, and synthesis into nonhu- man brains. But can we have it both ways? Can we depict talking, writing, thinking nonhumans in literature, art, and performance without fatally erasing the differences of which we must remain cognizant if we are going to cease operating under the as- sumption that "their" needs, wants, and desires are identical to "ours"? Growl Bear's aspiration to master human culture, his assumption of the responsibility to document and preserve language and history in the face of rapid human extinction, and his howled response, in the play's final moments, to the radio broadcaster's desperate plea - "If you're out there, and you can hear me, please. Say something" - can all be interpreted as an ironic and comic commentary on the essential hubris of anthropomorphism: Who but a human would imagine that a nonhuman would want to emulate us?55 And given all the things a talking, writing bear might create, what kind of chutzpah is it on our part to imagine that his priority would be our story? Yet in provoking those questions and the laugh of recognition that accompanies them, the play uses anthropomorphism as a means to "make the stone stony " (or, here, the bear beary) again, as it prods us to consider how ridiculous it is to assume, on the one hand, that nonhumans might share our priorities, and ignore, on the other, our mutual enmeshment in a political ecology. 52 Rigney, Bears, 8. 53 Bennett, Vibrant Matter, 112. 54 Rigney, Bears, 97. 55 Ibid., 108.</page><page sequence="15">QUEER ECOLOGY / CONTEMPORARY PLAYS / 579 My Barking Dog (201 1 ) My Barking Dog , by Eric Coble, is a comedy about two urban loners.56 Melinda works alone on the night shift in a factory; her job is to feed ream after ream of paper into a printing machine. Toby is an out-of-work middle manager who spends his days pacing about his apartment with a hand-me-down laptop trying to capture a free wi- fi signal so that he can search for a job. The opening of the play highlights the utter lack of interconnectedness and "enmeshment" that marks their lives: Toby knows his neighbors' routines intimately, but he has never actually met them, and Melinda is determinedly antisocial: "If I wanted to talk to people I'd work with people/'57 Their lives are transformed one night when a coyote ( Canis latrans, the "barking dog" of the title) appears on the fire escape of their apartment building. Melinda begins feeding the coyote hamburger every night and then starts to implement a revolutionary plan to return the coyote's "natural" habitat to him; Toby, on the other hand, has an intimate encounter with the coyote that leaves him pregnant with interspecies pups and, as a result, deeply enmeshed in the human /nonhuman political ecology. On one level the play is, as reviewer Tom Hayes observes, "an exploration of how modern society has gone grossly astray" and of "the dystopian lives we live today enwombed as we are by our technical electronic blah blah blahs and avoidance of meaningful interaction with the world around us."58 At the same time, the play is also overtly concerned with the problem of how humans and nonhumans can equitably share ecological space. Like both Grasses of a Thousand Colors and Bears , the figuring of the human /nonhuman relationship in My Barking Dog provokes queer ecological questions about our mutual enmeshment and shared contingencies. Unlike Rigney's play, though, My Barking Dog specifically works against the anthro- pomorphic representation of the nonhuman. Coble specifies in his production notes that "we should never, never see any animals"; the coyote is only "made visible" to the audience through the characters' description of it and through the actors' imagined sighting of, and mimetic interaction with, it.59 But although no animal is ever pres- ent, the play still foregrounds the question of the proper treatment of nonhumans by humans. When Melinda and Toby first see the coyote, their reaction is a mixture of astonishment and fear: "What right does he have to live in my city?"60 But then each is quickly startled into a sudden shift in perspective: Toby: And then it hit me. The question is: Are the coyotes the last dregs of a wild we are inevitably surrounding ... or are they the first scouts of a wild that is inevi- tably surrounding us? Melinda: And I knew I had it wrong. The question isn't what right does he have to live in my city . . . the question is what right does my city have to be in his life? Toby and Melinda: And that changed everything.61 56 My Barking Dog premiered at the Cleveland Public Theatre in May 2011, directed by Jeremy Paul. 57 Eric Coble, My Barking Dog (unpublished play, last modified 1 September 2012), 6. 58Tom Hayes, "My Barking Dog," weebelly.com, 8 June 2011, available at http:/ /www. weebelly. com/ 2011 ¡06/ page/8/ (accessed 12 April 2012). 59 Coble, My Barking Dog, title page. 60 Ibid., 11. 61 Ibid., 12.</page><page sequence="16">580 / Wendy Arons Their encounter with the coyote shocks them into an acknowledgment and recognition of shared space and time; the coyote's place is not some other place and his time is not some other time, it is here and now. Urban environments may provide the illusion of a human habitat disengaged from an imagined natural world "out there," but, in fact, both are constructs of human imagination and activity. Morton writes of the queer ecological thought that it is about the here and now; consequently, queer ecological art will insist on ambience and co-presence and make its medium present along with its content.62 Coble's play conjures such queer ecological co-presence: in the moment of live performance, the shiver of recognition that Melinda and Tim imagine receiving from the coyote is shared with and by the audience, as they also must imagine the coyote's presence in their space and time, and in their here and now. Resisting their initial urge to anthropomorphize the coyote (their first impulse is to guess that the coyote is "Waiting . . . Afraid . . . Hungry . . . Curious?"), Melinda and Toby struggle to find the proper way to engage with him.63 Melinda puts raw hamburger on Styrofoam trays to feed him, but she wants to maintain a distinction between making the animal an offering and trying to tame or possess him. When Toby takes out his cell phone to capture a photo of the coyote, Melinda stops him: Melinda: I thought about getting him a bowl for water, a drink with his meal, but I held the bowl in the store, this cheap plastic purple bowl . . . and I knew if I gave him water in it - if he made the mistake of drinking water from it, even once . . . he'd be just another dog. He'd be tame somehow. Or on the road to tame. If you take his picture you can look at it anytime, on your time. Right now we can only see him on his time, when he wants to be seen. How many things can you say that for these days?64 Melinda seeks to define a respectful, equitable encounter between herself and the nonhuman, one that both allows it its coyote-being and honors the time, space, and ecological realities it shares with humans. But where her encounter with the coyote challenges us to think about how to meet the nonhuman on something other than human terms, Toby's encounter with it radically destabilizes the species division on which that problem is grounded. Toby describes how the coyote came into his apartment, sat with him on his couch, and began to kiss him: Toby: [H]e leans over, slowly, delicately . . . his face is next to mine - I don't think I'm breathing now - I can hear his breath, smell it, clean and warm - I'm looking down, can't meet his eyes, but holding his paw, his nose inches from mine, his teeth - I know what his teeth can do, they're one whisker from my throat . . . but I turn to face him, I want to see his face, his eyes just once, full on, just once . . . and he looks at me, into me, in me, and he kisses me. And what's more shocking to me, I'm kissing him back, full on, hard, fierce, like I haven't kissed anyone for seventeen years - his yellow eyes are on mine, I've got a handful of fur and we're twisting, we're on the floor, my clothes are sliding off, his claws over me, kissing mouth in mouth inside mouth, inside each other, my hands over his face, ears, neck, thighs, shoved against the cof- fee table ready to be devoured, to be swallowed, be engulfed, to be him, to be one.65 62 Morton, The Ecological Thought , 104. 63 Coble, My Barking Dog , 9. 64 Ibid., 20. 65 Ibid., 28.</page><page sequence="17">QUEER ECOLOGY / CONTEMPORARY PLAYS / 581 The language here is reminiscent of both Ben's description of his encounter with the white cat in Grasses of a Thousand Colors and Martin's of his relationship with Sylvia in Edward Albee's The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?: in all three cases, sex with an animal is figured not as kinky or taboo, but in terms of profound connection and intimacy, a moment in which (in queer ecological terms) full enmeshment is suddenly, nirvanically realized.66 In each case, the trope of the human fucking the nonhuman that adheres to our cultural understanding of bestiality is refigured: sex with an animal becomes less a means of dominance of the human over the nonhuman than a radical opening of the human to the nonhuman. One difference here, however, is that unlike Martin and Ben, whose actual sex acts involve female nonhumans in ways that are both heteronormative and in accord with a Judeo-Christian "dominion" model of human/ nonhuman relationships, Toby's encounter with the coyote is thoroughly queer. The coyote and Toby are both male; it is the coyote, and not Toby, who initiates the encoun- ter, and (in a magical realist signal that what has happened is not, in fact, a dream or hallucination) Toby becomes pregnant as a result.67 The permeability of Toby's body to the coyote - "kissing mouth in mouth inside mouth, inside each other . . . ready to be devoured, to be swallowed, be engulfed, to be him, to be one" - writes large queer ecology's dissolution of the boundaries we imagine separating organisms and things from one another. At the same time, their ludicrous coupling turns out to be evolution-in-action, an example of the kind of "experimental, co-adaptive, symbiotic, and nonreproductive interspecies couplings that become evolution."68 This leads to another difference in this play's figuring of interspecies sex: where in the other two plays it is either ut- terly destructive to both human and animal (The Goat) or a symptom of the disease that humans have unleashed upon the planet (Grasses), in My Barking Dog, Toby's sex with the coyote is transformative, producing not only a new hybrid species, but also new "naturecultures."69 As Toby's pregnancy progresses, he gradually sheds signs of humanness, becoming less recognizably a person (but also not quite a nonperson): he lets his fingernails and toenails grow, he "can't stand the feel of [his] shoes anymore," he forages for food, and he gets "back on the sun's schedule."70 The coyote begins to 66 Martin's recollection of meeting the goat has similar tones of inexpressible communion: "She was looking at me with those eyes of hers and ... I melted"; "I knelt there, eye level. ... It was as if an alien came out of whatever it was, and it . . . took me with it, and it was ... an ecstasy and a purity, and a . . . love of a . . . ( dogmatic ) un-i-mag-in-able kind, and it relates to nothing whatever , to nothing that can be related to!" (Edward Albee, The Goat , or Who is Sylvia? [New York: Overlook Press, 2003], 80, 81 [emphasis in original].) 67The male pregnancy here is an obvious intertextual reference to Lenny's pregnancy in José Rivera's Marisol, and again the differences are instructive. Where Lenny's pregnancy is a dead end (the baby is stillborn), Toby's promises a new, hybrid, wild beginning. The hybrid baby as evolutionarily pre- adapted to the future is also figured in Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos. 68 Mortimer-Sandilands and Erickson, "Introduction," 39. 69 The term "naturecultures" is Donna Haraway's, and the choice of a coyote to precipitate evolution- ary invention in the world of the play is apropos, given Coyote's mythical status as a trickster who confuses boundaries of identity. William Grassie observes in Haraway's writing the hope that "Coyote and the other angels will come to our aid by playing wild cards to help us reinvent ourselves in this evolutionary crisis." See Grassie, "Donna Haraway's Metatheory of Science and Religion: Cyborgs, Trickster, and Hermes," Zygon 31, no. 2 (1996): 302 (available at http://www.grassie.net/articles/1995_ cyborgs.html [accessed 12 April 2012]). 70 Coble, My Barking Dog, 39, 43.</page><page sequence="18">582 / Wendy Arons bring Toby animals he has killed, which Melinda interprets as a sign that the coyote is "doing his best to be a good father"; while Toby is at first repulsed by the offerings, he nonetheless accepts the coyote's gifts, and later, when his pregnancy makes him ravenously hungry, butchers and eats them.71 By the time he has been evicted from his apartment, Toby is no longer dependent on the infrastructure it provides: he has forged a new natureculture for himself in the wild, with his coyote-mate. Melinda' s actions, meanwhile, aim at transforming the world into a habitat more equitably shared among the "people" it must support. She sees the coyote's seduction of Toby as an inevitable consequence of the human takeover of his territory: "Where is he supposed to meet [a mate]? There are no clubs, no bars, no Canis Latrans singles night at the ice-skating rink. We've done this to him, we've driven him to this, to mating for life with . . . ( Gestures at Toby). This."72 She starts by planting seeds in abandoned asphalt lots, but upon discovering that "for every one acre of city, where a mostly empty building sits, there could be 137 species of animals, ... 71 species of plants, and enough seeds to create another 28 acres of wildspace," she begins to set fire to abandoned buildings, leaving behind posted notices that "The Wild Needs A Home Too."73 Toby accuses Melinda of engaging in ecoterrorism, but from a queer ecologi- cal perspective, what she is doing can be understood as terraforming in another key, "leveling" the politico-ecological playing field to extend opportunity and rights to a greater number and variety of "not nonpersons." At the end of My Barking Dog, Melinda has delivered Toby of two coyote /human hybrid pups, "ready for a new world" that she has created by blowing up the city's sewer pipes and infrastructure, an "Eve in reverse, leading us all back to the garden."74 As a dozen new rivers course through the city, the emergency sirens morph into the howls of a hundred coyotes. Melinda and Toby interpret these howls as a sign that the coyotes are "calling through the dark for another ... I am here . . . where are you? ... If you can hear my voice answer me . . . just let me know I'm not alone."75 In the context of what has just happened, what would normally seem fatally anthropo- morphic about their imposition of human emotional needs and psychological drives onto a nonhuman' s cry seems, instead, to bespeak a future of potential interspecies communication: it is, after all, Toby's hybrid pups who are being welcomed into the world by these howls. Here, as in both Bears and Grasses, the future looks to be one in which human/ nonhuman relationships have been radically horizontalized, liquified, and hybridized. These are fantasies, of course, but queer ecological fantasies serve an ideological, political, ecological purpose: they open us to the big, disorienting, chal- lenging implications of what radical coexistence, cooperation, and enmeshment might mean to us, now and in the future. 71 Ibid., 37. 72 Ibid., 29. 73 Ibid., 40. 74 Ibid., 47-48. 75 Ibid., 49.</page></plain_text>
