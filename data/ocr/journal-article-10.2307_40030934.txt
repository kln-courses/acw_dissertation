<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Saffron Scourge: A History of Yellow Fever in Louisiana 1796-1905. By Jo Ann Carrigan. (Lafayette: Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana, 1994. Pp. xvi, 487. Acknowledgments, illustrations, tables, notes, bibliography, index. $27.50.) The Saffron Scourge is an informative, readable account of yellow fever in New Orleans from the first "memorable" epidemic to afflict the city in 1796 to the last visitation in 1905. Although the subtitle implies a statewide focus, the work is in fact centered on New Orleans and the series of epidemics which struck the city in the nineteenth century. The subtitle is not entirely misleading, however, for as Carrigan argues, the history of yellow fever in New Orleans is largely the history of yellow fever in Louisiana. The book is divided into two parts. The first is a narrative history of yellow fever in New Orleans. Carrigan begins her story by describing the first epidemic to occur, while the French were still in control of the city. She then proceeds to work her way forward in time, listing the reported outbreaks, the epidemics, and the periods during which the disease would absent itself from the city. This is no litany of scourges, though, for the book is full of first person accounts that give depth to the narrative. Furthermore, Carrigan mixes in enough political and social</page><page sequence="2">96 ARKANSAS HISTORICAL QUARTERLY history of the time to paint a backdrop against which the disease and its effects are clearly delineated. The second part of the book is a set of six chapters, the first four of which are a history of the controversies specifically concerning the disease. For all but the 1905 epidemic, little was known about the cause and transmission of yellow fever. To compound this ignorance many of the treatments suggested for curing the affliction were often fatal. Physicians and laymen alike argued heatedly over competing theories for curing the sick, eradicating the disease once it occurred, and preventing its occurrence in the first place. The unpredictable nature of yellow fever fueled the&amp;e controversies and paradoxically resulted in an attitude of seeming indifference to the disease by the citizens of New Orleans. As a minister of the time allegedly commented, "I like the people of New Orleans; they are not afraid of epidemics, and when they die, do not whine about it" (p. 339). This passive acceptance of the saffron scourge is detailed in the last two chapters of the book. Carrigan ends her work by examining the social, cultural, economic, and political effects that yellow fever epidemics had on the citizens of New Orleans and their city. Over time, the disease became such a common occurrence that residents of the affected areas developed anthropomorphic terms for it--"Bronze John on his Saffron Steed" and "His Saffron Majesty" being two of the more colorful names. Even physicians and nurses were likely to discuss yellow fever "in much the same terms as they would speak of a highly disreputable but very interesting acquaintance- a sort of Bohemian among diseases" (p. 9). Close association with the disease also produced "an 'insider' mentality shared by comfortable 'acclimated' New Orlean- ians who felt no affinity for the 'outsider' elements associated with the disease and poverty" (p. 335). Long time residents of the city and almost all of the newspapers went so far as to "construct a distorted image of health and prosperity in antebellum New Orleans" (p. 335). Whether or not these were sincere coping mechanisms or cynical attempts at deception, it is clear that the disease influenced all aspects of personal life for residents of the city. The Saffron Scourge was begun as a dissertation in 1961. Carrigan revised her work on the subject years later at the behest of her former professor. In revising the dissertation she retained its structure, and as</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 97 even she admits, the book suffers from this approach. A complete rewrite would probably have produced a tighter focus and more cogent arguments. Nonetheless, Carrigan has written an instructive book that can be appreciated by a layman and certainly has much to offer the more experienced historian.
