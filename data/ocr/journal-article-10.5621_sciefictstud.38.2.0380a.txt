<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 380 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) ends with “the old favorite—“Hello, Hugo!” Gernsback would have been amused.—Barbara Bengels, Hofstra University  Call for Contributions: Special Issue of SFS on Chinese Science Fiction. Contributors are invited to consider the history and development of sf in China, which has been influenced by, for instance, the rich tradition of Chinese fantasy literature, the blended influence of French/Japanese/Russian/Anglo-American sf, and the unique development of scientific culture in China. Given the rise of China’s global profile and the distinctive imaginative productions of Chinese culture, we hope to contribute to a greater understanding both of China and of science fiction. This special issue on Chinese sf aims to encourage researchers to explore the history of Chinese sf, important Chinese sf authors and works, new critical perspectives concerning Chinese sf, and the genre’s intersections with non-Chinese sf traditions.

This one-day conference was held at The Courtauld Institute of Art in London on 22 January 2011; it was organized by Dr. Gavin Parkinson of The Courtauld to explore the affinities shared (or not) among Surrealism, science fiction, and comics—especially their use of tropes of metamorphic transformations. Parkinson’s excellent introduction mapped out connections, pointing out that definitions of Surrealism and science fiction that arose at approximately the same time in the 1920s were anticipated by the proto-Surrealist comics of George Herriman and Winsor McCay.  The premise is appealing, but the result was an uneven selection of papers that struggled to make a triple articulation among these categories. This meant that while Surrealism was a constant feature, connections tended to be made to either sf or comics but rarely both. The only paper to really succeed at making this articulation was Dan Smith’s, which gave a sophisticated reading of the 2000AD strip, Nemesis (1980-1999), written by Pat Mills and illustrated by, among others, Kevin O’Neill and Bryan Talbot. The medieval future presented in Nemesis showed humans as genocidal bigots and aliens as sympathetic grotesques, a vision estranging, non-synchronic, and unmistakeably surreal. Refreshingly, Paweł Frelik’s paper questioned the overuse of “surreal” as a general adjective to describe strangeness. Frelik’s references to cyberpunk and slipstream made his paper the most up to date.  Unsurprisingly, New Worlds featured as a critical reference point throughout. David Brittain emphasized the importance of image-text relations by comparing J.G. Ballard’s condensed prose with Eduardo Paolozzi’s techno- collages, a conjunction that produced a visual sf whose ruptural properties were accentuated by the editorial process of “fold-ins.” No stranger to Ballard herself, Jeanette Baxter reassessed the largely forgotten novels of Alan Burns, a figure on the fringes of the New Wave. These challenging apocalyptic collage- texts that drew on Surrealist works and practices were read as significant and overlooked critiques of postwar culture.  </page> <page sequence="2"> NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE 381 Bryan Talbot presented an archive of anthropomorphic images, while Paul Gravett unearthed a genuine curio in the largely forgotten Herbie (a short, fat, and pubescent superhero, the “Fat Fury”). There was no sustained engagement with Francophone or East Asian comics and animation, surely more fruitful ground for both sf and Surrealism (think of Möebius and Mamoru Oshii as two obvious examples). More effort also could have been made to connect Surrealist diffusions to contemporary sf, such as the pseudo-Dadaist prose of Steve Aylett or the generic monstrosities of China Miéville (both have worked in comics). This was very much a curate’s egg of a conference, fascinating and frustrating, whose omissions one hopes will be covered in a subsequent publication project.—Tony Venezia, Birkbeck College, University of London 2011 SFS Symposium/Eaton Conference. The double bill of the third SFS Symposium and the 2011 Eaton Conference inspires, first and foremost, academic thoughts, but I would like to begin by noting that moving both events to February was an idea that deserves applause. While I am sure that the participants all came for intellectual nourishment and social networking, the opportunity to bask in the California sun before, after, and during the breaks in the program—at a time when many places from which they came were winter- ridden—enhanced the general atmosphere in no small measure. The same can be said about the venue. With the exception of the Friday afternoon plenary session held at UCR’s Culver Center for the Arts, all events took place in the Mission Inn Hotel and Spa in Riverside, a historic building famous in Riverside and Southern California but, viewed from a fantastic perspective, also a place whose structure, layout, and decor bring to mind the images of Gibson’s “Gothic folly” and Gaudi-esque architectural surreality.  As in 2009, the SFS Symposium served as a prelude, an initiatory but no less intellectually stimulating event. Entitled “The Singularity in SF Literature and Theory” and announced by a very impressively-designed flyer/poster, the symposium was held on Thursday, February 10, and featured three speakers. In his “Singularities,” Neil Easterbrook suggested that among the three S’s that have dominated science fiction for some time—slipstream, steampunk, and singularity—the last one seems to be the most precise and yet, as he ventured to demonstrate, the most ambiguous. Consequently, his presentation sketched out various understandings of the term: technological, cultural, psychological, and textual. Brooks Landon’s “The Light at the End of the Tunnel: The Plurality of Singularity” also stressed plural conceptions of the term but explored the territories closer to the field of sf studies: Kurzweil’s concept of accelerating change, Vinge’s metaphor of the opaque wall around the future, and nanotechnology, which was mentioned repeatedly. In “From Outer Space to Inner Space: New Wave Science Fiction and the Singularity,” Rob Latham took the discussion towards the discourses of literary history, suggesting that the New Wave could be considered a genre singularity but also concluding that the intra- sf revolution of the 1960s failed to reboot science fiction as a field.  The Eaton Science Fiction Conference kicked off on Friday morning, February 11, and for the next two days the participants could choose among thirty-six sessions and close to a hundred papers by presenters from the US, </page> </plain_text>
