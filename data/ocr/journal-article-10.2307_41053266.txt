<plain_text><page sequence="1">Historical Archaeology of Indigenous Culture Change in Mesoamerica Joel W. Palka Published online: 14 May 2009 © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract This essay outlines recent archaeological research on post-Columbian (c. A.D. 1500-1925) indigenous sites in Mexico and Central America. Historical archaeology is a growing field in Mesoamerica, and over the last 20 years inves- tigations of native culture change have increased, especially in rural areas. Con- temporary research contributes new insights on indigenous responses to Spanish colonization over a long period. This work also is reassessing chronologies and examining the diversity of indigenous behavior from late preconquest to historic times. Indigenous adaptations to culture contact and social change are characterized by three general stages: conquest, colonization, and independence. Although I do draw on other regions, the focus of the article is the Maya area and Central America, where more investigations have taken place. Keywords Historical archaeology • Mesoamerica • Postconquest • Indigenous societies • Rural settlements • Material culture • Interaction • Culture change Introduction Historical archaeologists have covered considerable ground in Mexico and Central America over the last 20 years. New insights on Mesoamerican indigenous cultures, past and present, have been gained through the investigation of historic sites. Historical archaeologists in Mesoamerica largely focus on architecture, Spanish society in the New World, and culture contact in colonial cities (Fernández Dávila and Gómez Serafín 1998). Yet lately, investigators have turned to indigenous J. W.

While large-scale excavations continue in Spanish cathedrals, for instance, archaeologists are now uncovering historic native villages, small agricultural hamlets, and residences in rural colonial towns. The results of this research point to the delineation of separate stages of culture contact and indigenous responses in different regions instead of a long monolithic period of cross-cultural interaction and social transformation. This essay outlines important research in Mesoamerican historical archaeology and its implications for the study of indigenous cultural adaptations from the Spanish conquest to the 19th century. The main topics are the archaeology of initial culture contact and conquest, cross-cultural interaction in the Spanish colonial period, and indigenous culture change in post-independence Mesoamerica. These three stages of cross-cultural interaction led to unique indigenous adaptations. The organization of the article follows these stages rather than regions or evolutionary periods. I use this structure because Mesoamerican historical archaeologists frequently examine similar problems but in different times, places, and societies, such as the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire in central Mexico in 1521 and the conquest of Maya kingdoms in Peten, Guatemala, in 1697. The archaeological findings outlined below frequently challenge or modify document-based scenarios regarding Spanish colonialism and indigenous culture change. Spanish colonization varied across time and space, but we know less about the effects of conquest, types of interaction, and indigenous adaptations in different contexts. From historical archaeology in indigenous sites, we can study the nuances of native adaptations to colonialism. Importantly, Spanish conquest of indigenous populations in rural areas was less complete, allowing for unique indigenous responses to change and the forging of new native societies. Since fewer documents exist from rural areas, archaeology is an important means of acquiring information on peripheral indigenous societies. Moreover, historical archaeology in Mesoamer- ica raises a significant research problem: "Postclassic" indigenous practices and material culture continue in the colonial period, which may pose problems for the identification of historic sites and the study of diachronic cultural and demographic changes (Charlton et al. 2005). Current ceramic chronologies in Mesoamerica with termination dates of 1521 (the date of the Aztec downfall) can actually be extended for decades or centuries in some cases. Additionally, cultures or objects that scholars label "Late Postclassic" actually date to the historic period. Hence, Postclassic, protohistoric, and colonial chronologies need to be reconstructed in some areas. This article covers publications (English and Spanish) from about 1990 to the present. In some instances, the fieldwork was completed earlier but researchers recently reexamined the data. I emphasize research on historic native culture change that utilizes extensive mapping, surface collecting, or excavations. Excavations at nonindigenous sites, including Spanish colonial buildings, mestizo settlements, and African sites, in addition to underwater archaeology, industrial archaeology, and ethnoarchaeology, deserve treatment elsewhere. This synthesis also concentrates on the Maya area and upper Central America where historical archaeology has been £} Springer</page><page sequence="3">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 299 published in more widely accessible sources in the last few decades. A large number of reports are published locally but are not discussed here. The discussion includes projects in central Mexico, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Yucatán, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Publications in Mesoamerican historical archaeology previously consisted of articles or chapters in edited volumes, but the number of books (Alexander 2004; Fernández Dávila and Gómez Serafín 1998; Fournier García 1990, 2007; Fowler 2006b; Jacobi 2000; Kepecs and Alexander 2005; Moholy-Nagy in press; Palka 2005a) and dissertations (Oland 2008; Sampeck 2007; Verhagen 1997) has increased, indicating a surge in academic interest in the subject. Several websites also contain reports and bibliographies for perusal (see Andrews' electronic resources; Famsi.org; and the Simposio [Guatemala] volumes). The significant increase in Mesoamerican historical archaeology is due in part to the current emphasis on the archaeology of post-European contact (c. 1500) and culture change across the globe. The historic record enhances our understanding of past indigenous societies and how they changed over time, allowing historical archaeologists to make significant contributions to method and theory in the discipline. Additionally, relevant issues in contemporary archaeology, such as ethnicity, economic change, and household production, are readily examined through the interface of documents, historic societies, and material culture. Furthermore, historical archaeologists recognized that previous field research neglected long periods, whole regions, and large archaeological sites in Meso- america. Nonetheless, the field of Mesoamerican historical archaeology is comparatively young. As the discipline matures, researchers will build regional chronologies, demographic profiles, models of human behavior, and theoretical perspectives over the decades to come. Historical archaeology in Mesoamerica Mesoamerica encompasses northern Mexico to northern Central America, including western Honduras and El Salvador (Fig. 1). The relevant chronological sequence in Mesoamerica is traditionally divided into the Late Postclassic (or "protohistoric," c. 1475-1520), early colonial (c. 1520-1600), middle colonial (c. 1600-1775), late colonial (c. 1775-1825), and Republican or independence (c. 1825-1925) periods. However, chronologies need to be refined through archaeology to coincide with historical and cultural developments region by region. The designation of a "protohistoric" period is important, since precontact lifeways and material culture continued into the colonial period in many areas, making a division between Late Postclassic and historic times difficult. The growth in historical archaeology in Mesoamerica, which gained ground as a discipline in the 1980s, is partially due to the realization that culture process over more than 400 years - almost as long as the Classic period - has been basically ignored by archaeologists. Additionally, extensive areas with numerous historic sites, such as highland Guatemala, central Mexico, Yucatán, and the Huasteca, have similarly been neglected by archaeologists. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="4">300 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 Fig. 1 Historic sites in Mesoamerica One reason for this neglect in Mesoamerican archaeology is visibility. Most historic indigenous sites are hard to locate since material remains or architecture is often not visible on the surface (Gaseo 1997b; Palka 2005a; Pendergast et al. 1993). Sites tend to be small and consist of perishable structures or low platforms. Monumental art and architecture are usually absent, except for occasional masonry buildings such as Spanish churches. Furthermore, artifact types, including utilitarian ceramics and worked stone, frequently remain unchanged during the precontact to Spanish-era transition. Hence, historic versus Postclassic site identification can often be difficult, especially from surface collections alone. Nonetheless, Old World pottery such as olive jars, majolica, and Chinese porcelain are often encountered at historic sites. Metal tools and glass beads are also frequently uncovered, and metal objects and some types of ceramics can be found with metal detectors (Palka 2005a). Specific indigenous material culture such as small side-notched arrowheads and a single course of vertical stone slabs in the Maya lowlands may indicate colonial period sites in some regions (Pendergast et al. 1993, p. 70). Artifact preservation at historic sites, including bone and pottery, is usually quite good but the deposits are often thin. Historical archaeologists have made great progress in locating sites with the use of documents, maps, informants, and ground surveys. It is important to note that colonial period sites can be found over or adjacent to Late Postclassic settlements. Still, many historic sites are found by accident after road cuts, agricultural activities, or excavations in ancient ruins have exposed them. In Mesoamerica, there are fewer historical archaeology projects when compared to North America. Additionally, some archaeologists are reluctant to call their work historical, even if they work with colonial period documents or artifacts. The combination of history and archaeology is not well accepted by some North â Springer</page><page sequence="5">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 301 American processual archaeologists (Funari 1998; Orser 1996). Investigations of indigenous contexts and culture process also have been infrequent until recently. Subsequently, little research in Mesoamerican historical archaeology found its way into edited volumes on Mesoamerican archaeology or world historical archaeology (but see Orser and Fagan 1995, p. 225). Scholars proclaim, however, that historical archaeology is a way of the future, particularly in Mesoamerica with its rich archaeological, historical, and ethno- graphic records (Brumfiel 2003; Jones 2005; Restall 2005). Importantly, archae- ologists view historical archaeology as historical anthropology where history, archaeology, and anthropology meet to effectively study past societies and culture change (Deagan 1998; Gaseo et al. 1997; Hall and Silliman 2006; Kepecs 1997a; Kepecs and Alexander 2005; Orser 1996). Mesoamerica is an ideal venue for studying ethnicity, impacts of disease, agency in culture contact, and ethnogenesis, where different perspectives can be gained. Mesoamerican archaeologists actively pursue these research topics in addition to the study of long-term indigenous culture change and continuity from the Spanish conquest to the present. Historical archaeology can be defined in many ways. Some scholars consider historical archaeology to be exclusively the study of European expansionism and its effects on cultures across the globe. Others state that it is text-aided archaeology, or the study of the material culture of societies with written records. Yet historical archaeology has been undertaken with societies that had no written records but who were coeval with literate peoples (Funari 2006; Funari et al. 1998; Orser 1996; Schmidt and Patterson 1995). Additionally, the term historical archaeology traditionally has been applied to research in the New World (Funari 1998). Historical archaeology is not the "handmaiden of history," and its utility is not the filling of gaps in the written record (Deagan 1991 ; Funari et al. 1998, p. 2; Hicks and Beaudry 2006; Orser 1996). Documents contain misleading and limited information. Importantly, historical archaeologists of indigenous cultures often examine culture process and reconstruct past lifeways in a more anthropological rather than historical perspective. They focus on material culture and documents in dealing with the interconnectedness of societies and historical or social processes (Funari et al. 1998, pp. 10-15). Historical archaeology also closely examines the everyday lives of all members of society, including "invisible" persons in documents, and how they interacted with one another (Funari 1998, p. 57). Archaeology, therefore, is an effective means of gathering information about rural indigenous people and changes in their lives in the colonial period because of the lack of documentary data. Orser (1996) cogently treats the debate of historical versus nonhistorical archaeology and succinctly outlines the philosophies and methodologies of historical archaeology followed by North American and European scholars. He argues that historical archaeology examines the modern world and changes in it since the expansion of Europeans around A.D. 1500. The colonization of every continent, global economic organization, Eurocentrism, and modernity after this time can be seen as main concerns of this discipline. Hence, historical archaeology studies colonialism, domination and resistance, capitalism, and their relevance to culture change. These issues, however, are not always prevalent in non-European societies. For example, cross-cultural interaction may not involve capitalism, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">302 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 Eurocentrism, or colonial domination in all parts of the world (Funari 1998; Funari et al. 1998, pp. 4-5; Schmidt and Patterson 1995). Archaeology in Latin America, particularly historical archaeology, links the past with the present and enters modern sociopolitical realms (Benavides 2001; Funari et al. 1998). Latin American scholars within the "social archaeology" paradigm argue for fewer intellectual divisions between prehistoric and historical archaeology, since the indigenous past is an integral part of the development of modern society in Latin America (Vargas Arenas 1995, pp. 62-63; see also Lightfoot 1995). Additionally, history in Latin American archaeology is not seen as being less relevant for the study of culture change as it is sometimes viewed in processual North American archaeology (Funari et al. 1 998). A "world perspective" in historical archaeology also is advocated by Latin American colleagues, where research is multidisciplinary and does not necessarily revolve around European expansion (Funari 1998, 2003). Instead, historical archaeology is viewed as the study of literate societies, socioeconomic divisions, and interaction in historically documented periods. Many Latin American archaeologists have research experience on historic sites. Many Mexican colleagues, for instance, have worked on colonial period, industrial, and 19th century urban sites. Additionally, historical archaeologists in Mexico have made contributions to the field by undertaking projects on a regional scale, involving multidisciplinary teams, infusing Marxist theory, and interpreting the archaeological evidence in terms of social change, economic transformation, ethnic interaction, and patterns of consumption (Fournier Garcia 1990, 1997; Fournier Garcia and Miranda Flores 1992; Patterson 1994; Politis 1999, 2003). Archaeol- ogists also have recognized important indigenous inputs to ceramics, architecture, diet, and acculturation in historic Mexico (Fournier Garcia 1990). For our purposes, historical archaeology relates to written documents or the study of cultures from times of widespread literacy following the Spanish conquest. Archaeology of cultures associated with pre-Columbian writing is not considered in this article. Classic Maya archaeology can be historical archaeology, for example, but ancient sociocultural contexts, material culture, and cultural transformations differ from the post-conquest era. Historical archaeologists have considerable information on how societies were organized, where settlements were located, what certain artifacts were used for, and when cultures changed based on texts. They also are multidisciplinary since they delve into ethnohistory and sometimes ethnography. For the purpose of this article, I follow a standard definition of historical archaeology in Mesoamerica: the study of past societies and the development of the modern world from the time of European contact to the present. We can view the long period of colonialism and its effects on indigenous societies in general stages (conquest, colonization, and independence) in different areas, including rural towns and small hamlets. Conquest, subjugation, and indigenous cultural transformations The Spanish conquest and initial cross-cultural interaction led to drastic social and economic changes in Mesoamerica. This section examines the immediate effects of £l Springer</page><page sequence="7">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 303 conquest on indigenous populations in addition to the elucidation of native survivalisms. These are significant issues investigated by historical archaeologists researching the Spanish conquest, the initial encounter between two worlds, and the first few decades of Spanish occupation. The indigenous reactions to conquest often differed from those of the subsequent colonial period. For the conquest period, investigators study early historic indigenous sites, the immediate impacts of violence and political subjugation of indigenous peoples, and initial native responses to culture contact. Research in historical archaeology in Mesoamerica also has helped scholars rethink traditional views of Spanish colonial policies and indigenous adaptations. These projects highlight the problem with the dating of contact period sites, since preconquest indigenous material culture often continues into the colonial period. Settlements and congregación in Antigua Valley, Guatemala The Spanish targeted the Antigua Valley in southern Guatemala early in the conquest, and the area became an important holding of the Spanish crown. The large Maya populations and optimal natural conditions in the valley were ideal for producing sugar, corn, wheat, dyes, soap, fish, reed mats, and later coffee for the growing colonial economy (Aparicio 1997). In this valley, archaeological inves- tigations have examined Kakchiquel Maya settlement patterns from the Late Postclassic (or protohistoric) to colonial times. Surveys have identified protohistoric to colonial period Kakchiquel sites based on a regional ceramic chronology. Colonial towns and industries in the area were well known historically, but archaeologists had little information on the demography and settlement patterns of the conquest-era Maya throughout the valley (Robinson 1997). Investigators discovered unique Late Postclassic to historic Maya rock art (Robinson 1997, p. 68; Fig. 2), which has received less attention compared to prehistoric examples (Palka 2005c; Stone 1995, p. 77, 1997). Research in the Antigua Valley of highland Guatemala demonstrates that the initial Spanish congregación program did not gather the conquered Kakchiquel Maya populations in towns as generally believed (Robinson 1997). Large numbers of Maya actually remained dispersed throughout the valley. Additionally, the surveys encountered protohistoric settlements at colonial towns, suggesting that indigenous people moved only short distances during early Spanish relocation programs. Scholars previously assumed that indigenous people moved over long distances in congregación programs. The findings also show that indigenous populations in the valley were larger than previously believed. The abandonment of hilltop sites for valley floor settlements demonstrates one disjunction in the Maya settlement pattern in the colonial period favorable to Spanish conquerors. Indigenous people from other parts of Meso- america, such as Nahuas from central Mexico, relocated to the valley following the conquest, but their houses and artifacts were not securely identified. Archaeologists working in the Antigua Valley have noted that indigenous ceramic types continued from the Late Postclassic into the colonial period, as in other parts of Mesoamerica. Nine of 11 pottery types survived, which obscures the dating of historic sites Ö Springer</page><page sequence="8">304 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 B C &lt;£ Fig. 2 Protohistoric-historic rock art.

Furthermore, the results indicate that the Spanish conquest immediately transformed Maya settlement patterns and demography, but indigenous people preserved their domestic lifeways and household production. Rural indigenous societies in central Mexico In the archaeology of conquest-era central Mexico, the material indicators of Spanish intrusion on indigenous lives were more apparent in the capital of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) than in the hinterlands, like Otumba (Charlton et al. 2005). The Spanish razed Aztec structures for the building of new edifices, and they introduced European material culture, mostly ceramics, figurines, metal, and glass, earlier in the capital. In both rural and urban areas, the conquest eliminated or reduced the number of indigenous elites (Charlton and Fournier Garcia 1993, p. 208). Indigenous people typically lived apart from the Spanish, and economic changes, religious conversion, and the introduction of foreign material culture transformed their lives. Aztec pottery and stone tools continued for utilitarian and religious purposes, particularly in rural central Mexico. Indigenous people did not have access to Spanish goods, and they opted for native technologies such as obsidian implements in rural Xaltocan, north of Tenochtitlan. Stone tools were practical, inexpensive, and important for the maintenance of local indigenous £j Springer</page><page sequence="9">Ô Springer J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 305 economic production and identity (Rodríguez-Alegría 2008a, b). Yet influences and changes imposed by the Spanish resulted in foreign influence. Indigenous sites throughout the Basin of Mexico in general indicate a reduction of indigenous cultural elements and the construction of a colonial society (Charlton and Fournier Garcia 1993, p. 214). Moreover, economic and social transformations of Spanish colonization were felt later and less intensely in rural areas. In the rural eastern Teotihuacan Valley near Otumba, archaeological investiga- tions of the indigenous Otumba polity have documented population decline from disease and displacement, the introduction of foreign material culture, economic change, and the introduction of Catholicism during the early colonial period (A.D. 1521-1620). Drastic economic and social changes occurred there during the early 17th century. Furthermore, site surveys and demographic estimates indicate that population loss was much greater in rural zones when compared to colonial towns. Diseases took their toll, people moved to urban areas or other regions, and rural areas did not attract immigrants (Charlton et al. 2005, p. 52). Investigators also have excavated an early colonial period (c. 1550-1600) cemetery associated with a rural church in the eastern Teotihuacan Valley (Charlton et al. 2005, pp. 57-58). The excavations encountered 71 human burials in part of the cemetery. The burials were generally not well preserved, but many individuals were assigned an age and sex. Specific skeletal features, including specific tooth wear and cranial shaping, indicate the presence of indigenous people in the cemetery. Christian customs dictated the way people were buried; the dead were placed on their backs with their feet to the east with their hands on the chest or pelvis. The excavators did not find many grave offerings, but some burials contained copper bells and domestic debris. The inhabitants moved partially decomposed bodies to accommodate additional burials. Further evidence suggests that colonial period epidemics caused the deaths. For instance, there are no telltale signs of trauma or chronic illnesses on the skeletons. Furthermore, the highest death rates were seen in children up to 10 years of age in addition to young adults (one group from 18- 25 years and another from 26-35 years), who made up the reproductive population. The data support comparative population declines seen in virgin soil epidemics elsewhere. Aztec archaeological sites of the Otumba polity dating to the early colonial period indicate a mix of pre-Columbian and postconquest material culture (Charlton et al. 2005, pp. 56-59). The continuation of artifact types, including Aztec ceramic serving wares and salt production vessels, hinders secure identifications of historic contexts in many instances. However, the colonial period at Otumba can be marked by the disappearance of certain native ceramics, such as long-distance trade wares and incense burners related to Aztec ritual, and the appearance of new surface decorations (orange slips and glazing) and more crudely formed pottery vessels (Charlton et al. 2005, pp. 58-59). Olive jars, European and Mexican majolica, and Chinese porcelains remained scarce in the area. Indigenous elites still existed at Otumba in the colonial period, but they did not obtain many foreign goods, including glass or metal (Charlton and Nichols 1992, pp. 256-257). Ceramic figurines also continued into the colonial period, but with less Aztec religious elements and artistic detail; manufacturing techniques survived, but many</page><page sequence="10">306 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 figurine forms did not (Charlton and Otis Charlton 1998; Charlton et al. 2005, pp. 59-60). Additionally, some historic human figurines depict European clothing and stylistic attributes (see also Evans 1998, pp. 345-348). Animal and flower forms continued and horse figurines appeared. Importantly, local Pachuca obsidian continued to be mined, exported, and used as cutting implements, including new scraper forms possibly utilized to process cattle hides (Charlton et al. 2005, p. 60). Franciscans built a chapel at Sierra de las Navajas, the site of obsidian mining, for the evangelization of indigenous miners (Pastrana and Fournier Garcia 1998), attesting to the importance of this industry. Similar population dynamics and artifact assemblages seen in Otumba occurred in historic Otomi sites in the Mezquital Valley, north of the Basin of Mexico (Charlton and Fournier Garcia 1993). The shallow colonial period deposits were often mixed with earlier artifacts or they contained eroded materials. Church and cemetery complexes replaced indigenous ritual structures. Archaeologists located Spanish-controlled mining settlements used by the Otomi to extract metals in the Mezquital Valley. Surprisingly, they recovered very few Spanish artifacts, including common Mexican majolica, in this region. Thus, their use of and importance to indigenous people in rural areas were negligible. Native wares utilized in processing agave sap for pulque made up the majority of the ceramics (Charlton and Fournier Garcia 1993, p. 212). Late conquest of central Peten, Guatemala Indigenous people, but few Spaniards, occupied most historic sites in central Peten, which contrasts with other areas. This region also is significant because the Spanish conquest did not begin there until 1697, which is late compared to other parts of Mesoamerica. This region represented a "zone of refuge" for Maya escaping the conquest, and it contained the last independent Maya kingdoms. The Maya resisted Spanish conquest, expanded militarily along the edges of their territory, and influenced surrounding conquered Maya populations (Jones 1998). Research in this region has examined Late Postclassic to historic Maya political organization, ethnicity, economic structure, and Spanish colonialism (Cecil 2001; Palka et al. 2007; Pugh 2001; P. Rice and D. Rice 2005). Ceramic analysis indicates that some types such as Chilo unslipped pottery (Rice 1987, pp. 180-181), red slipped wares (Cecil 2001), and modeled incense burner types (S. Kepecs and R. Alexander, personal communication 2008) continued into the historic period. The study of ceramic and architectural types assists archaeologists in the identification of historic Maya ethnic groups, their material culture, and political boundaries (Cecil 2001; Pugh 2001, 2003; D. Rice and P. Rice 2005; P. Rice and D. Rice 2005). Yet purely historic deposits have been hard to identify in the area because of indigenous cultural and material continuities. Spanish conquistadors destroyed the Itzaj Maya capital of Noh Peten, located on an island in Lake Petén Itzá, during the conquest of central Peten and constructed the town of Flores (Remedios) there. A contemporary Itzaj settlement may have been identified at the nearby peninsular site of Nixtun Ch'ich' (D. Rice and P. Rice 2005, p. 145). A large ball court and associated sculpture are similar to those found £} Springer</page><page sequence="11">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 307 at Chichén Itzá, adding to the evidence of an Itzaj Maya presence there (D. Rice and P. Rice 2005, pp. 143-147). The Spanish probably visited this site repeatedly during the conquest. Investigators found historic period artifacts on the surface of this site, which was probably known as Ch'ich' (Cecil 2001, p. 24). Postclassic (or historic?) structures are located in the eastern part of the peninsula near defensive ditches and walls that effectively protected this settlement. The Kowoj Maya, rivals of the Itzaj, lived just to the east of Noh Peten/Flores at Lakes Salpetén and Yaxha, based on documentary and artifactual evidence. The site of Topoxte, an island center in Lake Yaxha, contains abundant Late Postclassic Maya deposits. Additional research is needed to learn if some of the material culture, particularly pottery, dates to the colonial period. Archaeologists recovered Late Postclassic (A.D. 1250-1525) to contact period (A.D. 1525-1697) artifacts at nearby Zacpetén (Pugh 2001, 2003). Zacpetén is located on a peninsula protected from the mainland by a ditch and wall (Pugh 2003, p. 418), which made the site a prime location for Maya settlement during times of conflict. The Kowoj Maya utilized one building cluster at Zacpetén, Group C, in the contact period. Excavations recovered a lead musket ball in a ceremonial context near a temple (Pugh 2003, p. 421), and Group A at the site yielded iron artifact fragments and a diagnostic clay pipe stem (Pugh 2003, p. 422). The evidence indicates that the Maya continuously occupied or built on Postclassic architecture during the conquest period. Frontiers and ethnogenesis as social processes have been addressed through ethnohistory and archaeology in central Peten (P. Rice and D. Rice 2005). Instead of the "frontier as a place," investigators have examined political organization, zones of confrontation, and the creation of new indigenous societies (P. Rice and D. Rice 2005, pp. 150, 167). Prehistoric and historic Maya migrations to central Peten and the subsequent establishment of separate Maya ethnic and political identities, which are seen in differences in language, settlement patterns, burial practices, and material culture, resulted in ethnogenesis, competition, and differing reactions to the Spanish conquest. This region became an arena of social interaction and political conflict between Maya groups, including the Itzaj, Kowoj, and adjacent Maya refugees fleeing the conquest. The dominant Itzaj Maya pushed to economically and politically control the boundaries with other Maya while resisting Spanish colonialism. At the same time, the newly arrived Kowoj Maya contested the Itzaj for political power and controlled the eastern Peten by the end of the 16th century (P. Rice and D. Rice 2005, p. 168). World systems at Chikinchel, Yucatán Archaeological research in the Chikinchel region in northeast Yucatán has examined economic and political changes from the Late Postclassic to the 16th century transition to Spanish rule (Kepecs 1997b, 2005). The local Yucatec Maya populations and extensive salt production areas were important for pre-Columbian and Spanish governments. The region is well suited for historical archaeology because of the wealth of Spanish documents regarding local populations, salt production, and sociopolitical structure in early colonial times.

Research at Chikinchel has investigated continuity and change in Maya political and economic organization, world systems theory, and the effects of Spanish coloni- zation on Maya demography, salt production, and economics. In a regional survey, 29 settlements of various sizes from the total of 75 Late Postclassic sites contained colonial period occupations (Fig. 3). Loche, Ake, and Emal were the largest centers with historic finds. Diagnostic indigenous pottery on the surface, a few fragments of olive jars and Columbia Plain majolica, and the remains of two visita churches and historic wall constructions marked the settlements (Kepecs 2005, pp. 132-133). Traits of historic Maya pottery include localized paste types (sand and shell inclusions near the coast, for instance) and fewer slipped wares compared to the Postclassic. The data indicate that the regional market exchange of pottery and other goods was on the wane. The post-conquest occupations also lack fine trade pottery and high-quality craft items due to the Spanish truncation of indigenous economic networks. Importantly, the Maya economy in the region and the native world system, including the exchange of surpluses and high-quality salt for consumption and profit, survived the Spanish conquest. The Maya economy continued because of the underdeveloped Spanish occupation and political control of the region. Moreover, substantial Maya populations remained, including the sites producing salt in large quantities for local consumption and exchange between Maya settlements. The Spanish, however, transformed the regional exchange system by exacting tribute, particularly in salt, ultimately connecting Maya to the global European economic system. Ciudad Vieja, an early colonial town in El Salvador La Villa de San Salvador, now called Ciudad Vieja, was the first permanent Spanish capital in El Salvador (Fowler 2006b). Jorge de Alvarado founded the town in a sparsely inhabited area in the Valle de la Bermuda in the indigenous Pipil province of Cuscatlan in 1528. He may have placed this town on the settlement created by the £l Springer</page><page sequence="13">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 309 conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1525 or a Postclassic Pipil site, which may have led to artifact mixing. They placed the town there to avoid large indigenous populations who could resist the Spanish. Indigenous people were relocated there from other areas, including Tlaxcalan auxiliaries from central Mexico who were brought in to help the Spanish conquer El Salvador. The settlement pattern in this area differs from other areas, especially in the early colonial period, since the Spanish typically lived in areas with a large native labor force. The population abandoned the town and moved to the present capital, San Salvador, in 1545. Recent surveys and excavations at Ciudad Vieja examined the occupation of the site, identified different ethnic groups in the archaeological record, and studied culture change following the conquest of El Salvador (Fowler 2006b; Fowler and Gallardo 2002). While historic documents provide information on the Spanish inhabitants of Ciudad Vieja, the daily lives of the indigenous people can only be examined archaeologically. The goals of the Ciudad Vieja project included the examination of the layout of the settlement, the daily life and economic organization of the occupants, and identity formation during cross-cultural interaction in the early colonial period. The study explored cultural landscapes: culture determined the creation and organization of space, which was used differently during intensive culture contact (Fowler 2002, p. 18). In Spanish colonial towns, European and indigenous ideals of constructed space became intertwined. Archaeological investigations at the early colonial town of Caluco, El Salvador, addressed similar issues (Fowler 1995). Ciudad Vieja has not been obscured by modern agriculture or construction like other early European settlements in the New World. The town center measures almost 1 km square, but there were probably more outlying residences. The mapped portion of the site is 45 ha, making it one of the largest early European settlements in the New World (Fowler 2002, p. 23). The conquerors organized the town on a grid, which facilitated the control of the population and the growth of the settlement. The site core contains the main plaza and residential plots were set up on parallel streets surrounding it. Features discernible on the surface include terraces, house platforms, yard enclosures, and guard structures at the edges of the town. Defensive features such as walls and guard posts bear witness to episodes of violence or the threat of Pipil attack. Objects collected from the surface include ceramic roof tiles (rare at that time in the New World), ceramic sherds, grinding stones, and obsidian blades. Architectural remains and recovered artifacts indicate that indigenous people resided in the northeast and southeast portions of the site. The Spanish were concentrated at the site core near the central plaza. Excavations in the interior of one house platform revealed earlier constructions suggesting that rebuilding occurred rapidly over a short period. An oven feature and a dense midden containing animal bone and ceramic sherds were recovered near one residential structure. This deposit and others at the site contained Old World species, such as pig, cow, and chicken, and the remains of New World animals, such as turkey, jute snail shells, and fish. Some bones may have been from native birds and wild peccaries. The trash deposit also contained dog or coyote bones. The wild fauna indicates indigenous influence in the diet at Ciudad Vieja. One small building Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">310 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 at the outskirts of the site functioned as a guard post with a panoramic view. This structure contained obsidian projectile points and blades, possibly indicating the presence of trusted Tlaxcalan guards. The artifacts recovered in the excavations attest to the presence of many Spaniards at the city (probably fluctuating between 50 to 70 male household heads over time). European objects include iron tools, Spanish majolica, earthenware pitchers, and religious items such as a metal cross and glass rosary beads. The significant indigenous presence at Ciudad Vieja is signaled by the abundance of native pottery resembling precontact forms, spindle whorls for making cotton thread, and obsidian blades, some from Pachuca in central Mexico. Conquest-era highland Chiapas, Mexico Archaeologists have mapped and excavated Los Cimientos, a contact-period Maya site near Comitan, Chiapas (Lowe and Alvarez Asomoza 2007). Located on an island in a shallow lake, it may be a settlement that is mentioned in historic documents. Possibly Coxoh or Tojolabal Maya occupied Los Cimientos, and the Spanish may not have visited the site. The site is important for the archaeology of these little-studied past Maya groups and significant for research on culture contact in eastern Chiapas. The settlement contains a few low public buildings and residential compounds; the majority of the residences rested on platforms built on the hill that formed the island (Lowe and Alvarez Asomoza 2007, p. 326). Additionally, investigators encountered extant wooden poles that once supported a bridge connecting the settlement to another small island. Excavators identified post holes in the residential excavations, as well as the remains of stone platforms, wattle and daub walls, stuccoed walls, and plaster floors (Lowe and Alvarez Asomoza 2007, pp. 327-331). They also encountered an oval sweat bath with a plaster floor and separate kitchen structures. Utilitarian pottery, charcoal, animal bones, and a large number of jute shells were recovered in one kitchen (Lowe and Alvarez Asomoza 2007, pp. 332-334). Indigenous ceramics include burial urns, cooking vessels, comales, incense burners, strainers, water jars, zoomorphic whistles, spindle whorls, and flat seals. One jar with handles is decorated with a modeled anthropomorphic figure similar to historic Lacandon Maya vessels in lowland Chiapas (Palka 2005a, pp. 251-266). Lithic artifacts consist of grinding stones in addition to chert spearheads, knives, and arrowheads. The past inhabitants worked obsidian from Guatemala and central Mexico into scrapers, blades, and ear flares. Other trade items include amber beads and lip plugs, greenstone beads, marine shell beads, copper and bronze artifacts (needles, rings, bells, chisels, and an axe), and an olive jar fragment. The findings at Los Cimientos show that the Spanish conquest of Chiapas in the first part of the 16th century greatly impacted rural protohistoric Maya communities. The Spanish conquest may have eliminated long-distance trade, for instance, which cut off highland Maya access to indigenous and Spanish goods. The indigenous population more than likely abandoned the site in the early colonial period. Although the Spanish probably did not occupy the site, it is possible that disease decimated the population or they relocated the natives elsewhere. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="15">J Archaeol Res (2009) 1 7:297-346 3 1 1 Uncolonized lowland Chiapas, Mexico At the time of the Spanish conquest of central Mexico and Guatemala, a significant number of remote Maya settlements were situated on islands in lakes in northern Chiapas. The Ch'olti-speaking Lacandon Maya inhabited small islands and a large center on the biggest island in Lake Miramar called Lakam tun (from which the Spanish "Lacandon" is derived) meaning "wide stone" (Palka 2005a; Rivero Torres 1992). Spanish conquistadors attacked Lacamtun in 1529, 1559, and 1586 to expel the Maya habitants, who escaped into the bush. The conquerors razed the island, destroyed cornfields, and killed Maya combatants. The Spanish documents mention the large number of well-built houses painted white on the island and numerous settlements in the vicinity (Rivero Torres 1992, p. 24). Archaeological findings from reconnaissance, mapping, and test pitting (Rivero Torres 1992) at remote Lake Miramar indicate that Spanish influence was minimal, that the Maya fled to unconquered territory, and that "Postclassic" Maya culture continued into historic times. Although Maya inhabited the island from Late Formative to historic times, much of the visible architecture is similar to Postclassic buildings in the Maya area (Rivero Torres 1992, p. 177). Historic Lacandon Maya pottery found at the site has not been precisely dated (Rivero Torres 1992, p. 179). Many masonry structures, along with the ceramics, lithics, burials, rock art, and three-dimensional sculpture encountered in the investigations, are difficult to date because historic Maya artifact and architectural types resemble Postclassic examples. Furthermore, there are few studies that compare Postclassic to historic Maya material culture in northern Chiapas, making for difficult recognition of diagnostic historic Maya artifacts. Artifacts dating to the historic period include unpainted indigenous ceramics such as comales (griddles) and effigy incense burners, a fragment of a Spanish vessel, several distinctive bowl types, and small projectile points made from obsidian and chert. Recently, investigators have carried out surveys on the shores of Lake Mensabak, located north of Lake Miramar, in search of unconquered Maya and historic Lacandon Maya sites (Palka et al. 2008). The Spanish briefly visited this area during the colonial period, but they never conquered these remote Maya. Spanish colonial records mention Ch'olti and Yucatec Maya settlements on lakeshores in this region (Palka 2005a). The project identified masonry platforms along the lakeshore and mapped six habitation sites. Lacandon informants state that more sites are located around the lake. The exposed dry-laid stone masonry at the sites appears recently abandoned, and the layout of the buildings and sites suggest a Late Postclassic to historic date. Furthermore, over a long period the Lacandon Maya and their historic predecessors settled at Lake Mensabak and visited local cave shrines to perform rituals. Several historic Lacandon cave shrines exhibit multicolored designs on their exterior rock faces (Palka et al. 2008). Many cliff paintings resemble historic Lacandon paintings on clothing and incised gourd designs (Fig. 2). Maya rock art continued into the colonial period (Stone 1997); Lake Mensabak cliff paintings appear to date to historic times as well. This rock art represents the enduring ritual importance of Maya sacred landscapes (Palka 2005c). The heaped cultural deposits at the shrines at the cliff bases include hundreds of Postclassic and historic ceramic Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">312 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 incense burners, Lacandon god pots, multiple human burials with skulls exhibiting artificial shaping, rotting boards for holding incense, and turtle carapace drums. Mexican colleagues recently radiocarbon dated one human skull to A.D. 1650. This finding indicates that Maya Postclassic skull shaping continued in the area in historic times. The Maya residing in this remote territory preserved their lifeways and religious practices, including rituals at cave shrines, in the absence of Spanish subjugation. Environmental change in Patzcuaro Basin, Michoacan, Mexico The Tarascan (Purépecha) empire, centered in the Patzcuaro Basin in Michoacan, Mexico, was one of the largest Mesoamerican states conquered by the Spanish in 1522 (Pollard 2005). At that time, the Spanish reorganized the local economy around silver mining, which resulted in the loss of native elite power, the erosion of indigenous political organization, and the decimation of the supporting population. Settlements and populations declined precipitously in the first century following the conquest of the Tarascans due to epidemics and population removal. Recent archaeological and ecological research provides additional insights into past demography, agricultural practices, and environmental change in the Patzcuaro Basin (Fisher 2005; Pollard 1993, 1997). Sediment coring in Lake Patzcuaro tracked upland and field erosion from pre-Columbian times to the present (Fisher et al. 2003). Studies of settlement patterns, population densities, agricultural practices, and soil erosion and how they changed over time indicate that European colonization of the Patzcuaro Basin, beginning in the 16th century, had tremendous demographic and environmental impacts. Land degradation in the basin resulted from human modifications and sociopolitical processes from the Classic to colonial periods. Tarascan populations grew in the basin until they reached their maximum in the Late Postclassic Tariacuri phase (c. 1350-1520). Soil erosion remained low at that time due to the heavily terraced and managed agricultural landscape (Fisher 2005, p. 90). Some of the highest erosion rates in the cultural sequence in the basin began in the early colonial period, when soils were stripped from the surface and deposited in the lake, making it shallower and smaller. Heavy erosion occurred despite the fact that only about 1,500 to 3,000 people remained by 1650. The findings challenge previous models of high population densities and increased land use for agriculture leading to erosion. The results also show that land degradation can be linked to other variables besides environmental change. The erosion was precipitated by the abandonment of settlements, the neglect of agricultural fields, European farming techniques, and increased rainfall (Fisher 2005, p. 92). The erosion was due to the neglect and destruction of deserted terraces and fields following demographic decline in the colonial period and was not the result of land clearance for agriculture, overcropping, or increased rainfall. Interaction at San Román, Tabasco, Mexico San Román, one of the largest centers of the Postclassic and historic Chontal Maya (Chavez 2007), is located near historic Potonchan in Tabasco. The Chontal Maya £l Springer</page><page sequence="17">ö Springer J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 313 from this area were well-known merchants and warriors who interacted in the early colonial period with Spanish conquistadores and missionaries. The Spanish contacted the Chontal in the early 1500s, arrived at Potonchan in 1519, and established settlements in the area around 1525. Investigators have obtained a large ceramic sample from San Román to set up a regional chronology (Chavez 2007). This collection contains large quantities of Old World pottery, pointing to early colonial Spanish occupation and trade. The results of the excavations and pottery analysis at San Román are important for examining ceramic dating and cross-cultural interaction in the colonial period. The project highlights the difficulty in separating Postclassic indigenous pottery from historic counterparts. The early colonial period occupation (Santa Maria ceramic complex, 1521-1650) is framed by the date of the conquest of Mexico and the presence of time-sensitive olive jars, vitrified ceramics, Chinese porcelain, and majolica from Spain, Mexico City, and the Dominican Republic (Chavez 2007, pp. 1 167, 1 173). However, the excavators found Old World pottery with Maya ceramic types from the Late Postclassic period (Chavez 2007, pp. 1173-1174). The association of ceramics used by the Spanish and indigenous wares indicates that the Spanish resided with the Chontal Maya and consumed local foods from indigenous plates. At the same time, the Maya acquired pottery imported by the Spanish, indicating their participation in colonial politics and economics at an interregional level. Importantly, the presence of Spanish pottery marks the early colonial period, as does certain indigenous pottery, some of which shows influence from central Mexico. Interestingly, Maya Fine Orange pottery manufactured in this region since the Classic period was still present in historic times. Colonization, cross-cultural interaction, and culture change A large number of projects have investigated colonial period sites with occupations that postdate the conquest by a few centuries. These sites are numerous and often easy to locate since they represent the last occupations of an area. They are more visible archaeologically due to their large size, exposed Spanish-influenced architecture, and long occupational history. The literature pertaining to these sites discusses cross-cultural interaction and social, political, economic, material, and religious changes over a long period. In addition to information on native adaptations, indigenous domestic life, and rural populations in the colonial period, historical archaeology has obtained new information on indigenous acculturation and resistance, the introduction of capitalism, and impacts of disease on native populations. The Maya frontier at Chanlacan, Lamanai, and Tipu, Belize Recent research at Chanlacan at Progresso Lagoon, Belize, a remote Maya settlement and Spanish encomienda (c. 1547-1 600s), has examined historic Maya settlement patterns, chronology, structure functions, local economic organization, resistance, and interaction with unconquered Maya (Oland 2003, 2005, 2008). The</page><page sequence="18">314 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 Maya at Chanlacan initially resisted Spanish rule in the early colonial period. Then they submitted to the Spanish and paid tribute to them in the mid- 1600s. Foci of research at Progresso Lagoon are a historic Maya residential zone and plant remains recovered from the site, both of which are not common in Mesoamerican historical archaeology. Test excavations identified a historic site of about 1 1 ha near low mounds on the southwest shore of Progresso Lagoon (Oland 2003, p. 7). Artifact scatters dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries have been recorded at the site (Oland 2003, pp. 14-23). A dense midden contained sherds from Maya utilitarian pottery similar to early colonial period Yglesias wares at Lamanai (Graham 1987, p. 93), a large quantity of chert projectile points, animal bone, a glass bead fragment, conch shell ornaments, and Spanish olive jar sherds. The investigators recovered small quantities of obsidian, as well as copper axes, nails, and a piece of sheet copper dating to the colonial period, which may have been made at Lamanai. Charred plant remains were found in two fire pits indicating food preparation in those features. A structure in the site core (Str. 1) is possibly the residence of high-status Maya and dates from the Early Classic to the colonial period. The structure's surface and adjacent areas had high concentrations of Spanish artifacts and exotic Maya goods (Oland 2003, pp. 8-9), including one hematite and several glass beads (one dating before 1550), ceramic beads, olive jar fragments, iron tool fragments, an iron axe, several copper axes, chert projectile points, human teeth, and pieces of polished greenstone. Incense burner fragments near the surface indicate ritual activity. The remains of domestic activities and feasting include stone manos and metates and large quantities of animal bone. A nearby small mound served a ritual function in the colonial period (Oland 2003, p. 7); there were numerous scattered incense burner fragments, Maya ceramics, and Spanish olive jar fragments associated with this structure but few domestic artifacts and faunal remains. There was a substantial Late Postclassic to colonial period settlement around the site core (Oland 2005). A high frequency of historic artifacts in this area, particularly Maya ceramics, helped pinpoint residences, three of which were excavated along with a small shrine (Oland 2005, pp. 21-32). Ancient mounds in the habitation zone also exhibited historic deposits near the surface. A rare copper fishhook was found near one mound (Oland 2005, p. 9). Specific finds in the residences include ground stone, a shark eccentric flint, crystals, ceramic beads, copper bell fragments, worked shell, chert bifaces, and worked obsidian. The shrine contained censer fragments, faunal remains, and a burial. The interment, associated with a box construction and a smashed incense burner overhead, consisted of a middle aged male with cranial molding seated in flexed position (Oland 2005, p. 29). The grave contained a fish, a drilled ceramic disk, marine shells, obsidian blades, and a string of human and animal teeth (dog and peccary), shell beads, and a coral pendant. Another seated, flexed burial of a young adult, probably a male, was found under a stone surface in a historic platform (Oland 2005, pp. 25-26). Analysis of archaeobotanical remains recovered from excavations and flotation (Morehart 2003; Oland 2003, p. 3) identified surprisingly low quantities of pine £} Springer</page><page sequence="19">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 315 charcoal (28% of the sample), which was used for lighting fires, torches, and burning incense. This differs from ancient Maya sites in Belize where pine is common. Therefore, the ecology may have changed, the historic Maya did not extensively use this wood, or pine did not preserve well (Morehart 2003, p. 130). The excavations recovered hardwood in higher frequencies (39%), some possibly from mangroves. These samples include the copal incense tree (Morehart 2003, p. 128). The remains of several fruit trees, including hog plum and mamey (zapote; Morehart 2003, p. 129), indicate that arboriculture was practiced in the colonial period. Palm shell pieces were abundant. The Maya cultivated palms for fruit, food ("palm hearts"), drink, cooking oil, and thatch. The investigators noted cotton, maize, squash, and calabash remains as well. The analyzed faunal remains (Ferguson et al. 2003, pp. 163-168) include such aquatic specimens as edible fresh water apple snails (Pomacea) and jutes, in addition to marine scallop, conch, oyster, bivalves, and corrals. Animal remains include deer, turtle, peccary, fish (fresh and saltwater), armadillo, crocodile, agouti, and unidentifiable bird, mammal, and reptile bones. The absence of Old World plants and animals at the site is noteworthy since Spanish documents mention their presence in the Maya lowlands. This research has contributed to the creation of a colonial period ceramic sequence of indigenous and European pottery in the Maya lowlands. It also has documented large Maya settlements in the Spanish frontier of southern Yucatán. The Maya interacted with the Spanish, but they largely remained politically and economically autonomous, indicated by the paucity of foreign objects and foods, the continuance of native settlement patterns and architecture, and the preservation of Maya ritual and burial practices in this rural area. Maya elites rather than commoners interacted with the Spanish. Indigenous material culture prevailed and the inhabitants more than likely participated in extensive interactions with unconquered Maya to the west, particularly the Itzaj and Kowoj of central Peten. Archaeologists investigated Postclassic Maya settlements, colonial period churches, and historic residences at Lamanai in the 1980s and analysis continues on the excavated materials (Graham et al. 1989; Pendergast 1991; Wiewall and Stanchly 2006). Lamanai is located on a lake connected to the New River in Belize. In 1637, 72 people occupied Lamanai (Jones 1989, p. 117), but we know little about the population before and after that date. The small population points to the ephemeral presence of the Spanish at the site in the colonial period. The conquerors attempted to Christianize the Maya, acquire taxes, and control native labor rather than relocate or assimilate the population. Interaction with the Spanish dates from 1544 to 1641. The contact had little impact on indigenous material culture (Pendergast 1991). However, investigators found Spanish olive jar fragments near an early church and recovered a small amount of painted European wares, glass beads, and some metal such as nails, knives, metal straps, locking mechanisms for chests, an axe, and hinges for a book at the site (Pendergast 1991, pp. 347-351). These objects were used by a small number of Spanish inhabitants, perhaps were gifts to a few Maya, or they reflect that trade in foreign goods was not well established. The main historic residence contained the majority of the glass beads, many of the Nueva Cadiz type. Copper artifact Ö Springer</page><page sequence="20">316 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 manufacturing and working was important at the site during the contact period (Pendergast 1990). The inhabitants melted earlier metal artifacts in the casting of large celts (Pendergast 1991, p. 340), some of which may have been traded to Chanlacan (Oland 2003, p. 9). Importantly, Terminal Postclassic Yglesias phase ceramic vessels and figurines continued to be produced in the early colonial period (Pendergast 1991, pp. 343, 348). Archaeologists also found Yglesias pottery in structures and middens associated with Spanish artifacts (Graham 1987, pp. 91-95) and the historic chronology is anchored by radiocarbon dates. The evidence indicates that Maya economic and religious practices, in addition to household ceramic production, continued into historic times. The first permanent Spanish church with a stone foundation at the site, similar to the church at Tipu, Belize, was built in the 16th century over a destroyed Late Postclassic Maya temple (Pendergast 1991, pp. 341-342). The Maya cached a historic bat effigy ceramic figurine in the temple as an offering during indigenous rites during the construction of the church (Pendergast 1991, p. 343). Residents built a larger church with a masonry chancel several feet high in the 17th century. The masonry of the church closely resembles that of European constructions. The newer church, which exhibits walls with a cemented core and thick plaster facing, indicates stronger Spanish influence during the 1600s. This church was burned in a Maya revolt around 1638-1641. Maya living around this abandoned church practiced indigenous and Christian beliefs. They placed a stela, altar, and figurine caches within the ruined church after the revolt (Pendergast 1991, p. 347). The caching of objects in church constructions also continued into the 19th century in other parts of the Maya region (Lemus Toledo 1998, pp. 33, 68-70). Investigators analyzed a large sample of faunal remains from historic period deposits at Lamanai (Emery 1999). Although there were some changes in animal use at Lamanai in historic times, the transformations, such as the decrease in species heterogeneity and the rise of fish and avian resources, began during the Postclassic period. Hence, dietary changes were not entirely due to Spanish occupation (Emery 1999, pp. 62, 72-73). The acquisition of more birds may be related to the adoption of the bow and arrow; the increase in fish can be traced to a maritime focus in the Maya diet at that time. The Maya procured fewer large mammals, such as deer and wild pig, and reptiles at historic Lamanai. Furthermore, evidence suggests the elevated importance of aquatic and agricultural resources following the conquest. Turkeys were abundant during the historic period; their numbers actually began to increase in the preceding Postclassic period. The presence of these birds also may reflect interaction with and migrations of Yucatec Maya as seen in the material and historic records (Emery 1999, pp. 74-75). A large number of burials at Laminai date to the Postclassic and historic periods. A Maya noble's and possible ruler's burial dating to the contact period contained ceramics, metals, and other goods (Pendergast 1991, p. 340). Overall human health decreased at Lamanai during the colonial period, which is believed to be related to disease rather than dietary stresses (White et al. 1994). The stresses include anemia- induced lesions on the skull and tooth enamel defects of people who survived introduced diseases. Increased poor health indicators were particularly evident in historic burials of children (White et al. 1992). What is fascinating about the £i Springer</page><page sequence="21">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 317 isotopie analysis of the historic period populations is that they depended on maize instead of acquiring nearby aquatic resources. These findings contradict the large number of turtle bones found in historic middens (Pendergast 1991, p. 345), which may indicate differential access to food according to social status. Researchers investigated a Spanish visita mission (a settlement visited by itinerant priests) at Macal Tipu, Belize, in the 1980s. Recent work has focused on the artifacts and human remains from the site. Archaeologists mapped Tipu, dating to about 1544-1707, and excavated in and around the colonial period church (Graham 1990; Graham et al. 1989; Pendergast et al. 1993). Tipu was one of the few missions discovered in the southern Maya lowlands. Mainly Maya occupied the site, but two buildings may have housed visiting Spanish clergy (Emery 1999, p. 63). The site was important for the local cacao trade, Maya fleeing colonial rule sought refuge there, and the indigenous residents were socially and economically tied to unconquered Maya in Peten, Guatemala (Cohen et al. 1994, p. 121). In 1618 Tipu had about 350 inhabitants; by the 1640s it probably had more than 1,000 due to the influx of refugee Maya. The population decreased to around 400 by 1697 when the Spanish returned after 50 years of Maya rule (Cohen et al. 1994, p. 121 ; Jones 1989, p. 116). Tipu was a small site with several mounds scattered around a church. Historic buildings were not readily visible on the surface. Small rises in the terrain marked the presence of pavements of unshaped stones, which made up the foundations and floors of buildings (Pendergast et al. 1993, p. 65). After excavation, archaeologists noted a possible Spanish plaza arrangement (Pendergast 1991, p. 343). There was a large cemetery within the church. They also encountered buildings and artifacts dating from precontact times to the Spanish colonial period. Postclassic Maya material culture, including indigenous pottery, continued into the historic period. Spanish artifacts were minimal (Graham et al. 1989; Pendergast et al. 1993, pp. 66-67). Stone tools of the historic period Maya consisted of reused obsidian blades and small (less than 4 cm) side-notched arrowheads made from prismatic chert blades with a large flake scar on one side (Simmons 1995). Excavations recovered a few Spanish olive jar fragments and majolica sherds in addition to some glass beads. The artifacts indicate that Tipu remained in the Spanish colonial frontier and that less acculturated Maya resided at the site. Spanish goods must have been acquired from visiting priests and Maya subjugated by the Spanish. Studies of faunal remains from Tipu indicate that the precontact species diversity continued in the historic period, but investigators confirmed an increased reliance on turkeys, turtles, and armadillos (Emery 1 999, pp. 72-73). The inhabitants preferred small animals, reptiles, and fish for their diet, reflecting earlier patterns from the Postclassic Only slight changes in the frequencies of species and the different ecosystems exploited occurred through time. A slight emphasis on coastal and possibly trade species such as fish and turkeys may reflect the maintenance of Maya culture during their autonomy and isolation in historic times (Emery 1999, p. 78). The cemetery at Tipu provided information on the demography and health of the resident colonial period Maya population. The cemetery contained a large number of human skeletons from historic Mesoamerica (Cohen et al. 1994; Jacobi 2000). The church and nearby grounds held more than 580 historic Maya burials, including Ö Springer</page><page sequence="22">3 1 8 J Archaeol Res (2009) 1 7:297-346 176 males, 119 females, 41 indeterminate adults, and 249 juveniles (Jacobi 2000, pp. 15, 86). Burials inside the church accounted for nearly half the interments, consisting mainly of men and juveniles (Jacobi 2000, p. 106). The burials were extended with heads placed to the west and arms crossed over the chest in Christian fashion. There were few signs of offerings or cranial and dental modification, as seen in historic burials elsewhere in Mesoamerica (Tiesler and Zabala in press). Artifacts, glass or rosary beads (many with children), and other jewelry accom- panied some burials. For example, excavators discovered beads of jet and amber from Old World sources (Lambert et al. 1994). The investigators noted differences in health, in addition to burial treatment and location, between males and females (Jacobi 2000). The results may point to social differentiation based on gender, diet, status, and burial practices. Burial clusters and tooth morphology suggest the presence of local Maya family clusters (Cohen et al. 1994; Jacobi 2000, p. 185). Infants and old adults were underrepresented in the sample, which may mean that the inhabitants did not bury unbaptized babies at this location and that epidemics may have occurred. There are few signs of violent trauma and overall health indicators were generally good, which support disease as the cause of relatively quick deaths. However, there were no mass burials at the site to indicate epidemics. Colonial Maya towns in highland Chiapas, Mexico A long-term project in the eastern highlands of Chiapas studied colonial settlements along the camino real (Lee and Bryant 1988; Lee Whiting 2001). The research examined the lives of the Spanish and their Maya subjects from the conquest of the area in 1524 to the early 19th century. The investigators analyzed Maya survivalisms in the colonial towns, indigenous culture change, and the organization of the royal road, which was the principal Spanish transportation, lodging, trade, and communication route connecting the governed towns in the region. Archaeologists focused on indigenous continuities and change in domestic life and material culture. Investigators recently published information from excavations at Coapa and Coneta (Gaseo 2005, p. 89; Lee and Bryant 1988; Lee Whiting 2001) and placed reports on the New World Archaeological Foundation website. The Maya used Spanish painted pottery in low quantities in their houses. Small Old World animals such as pigs and chickens were important in the Maya diet earlier than cattle (Lee Whiting 2001, p. 54). Important sources of protein for both the Spanish and Maya include fresh water jute snails. Indigenous pottery of preconquest forms continued to be widely manufactured and also used in Spanish residences. Furthermore, incense burners found in the church at Coapa mimic Postclassic types. Contem- porary Tzeltal Maya in the area continue to create colonial period candleholder styles. The Maya potters also copied Spanish jar, pitcher, and plate forms. Gold and copper objects continued in historic times, but the introduction of silver objects and iron tools occurred slowly. Iron artifacts were encountered in all Maya houses, including nails and digging stick tips (Lee and Bryant 1988, p. 15). Investigators studied the layout and functions of structures at Coapa (c. 1530- 1660) and described domestic architectural types and associated Maya social Ö Springer</page><page sequence="23">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 319 statuses from elites to commoners (Lee and Bryant 1988, pp. 10-12). Elite constructions clustered near the main plaza and exhibited Old World architectural features. The project identified four barrios oriented to the cardinal points, possibly reflecting Maya influence. Maya kitchens and domed sweat baths were common at Coapa. The artifacts recovered include manos and metates of pre-Hispanic form, chert tools, obsidian flakes, blades, and small arrow points, and numerous iron artifacts, including nails, faucets, axes, lances, horse shoes, keys, latches, machetes, and digging stick tips (Lee and Bryant 1988, pp. 15-18). The historic Maya may have found obsidian artifacts at nearby Postclassic sites and reused them rather than trade for them. Other objects include silver artifacts such as medallions, chains, crosses, urns, milagro offerings, crown fragments, and threads for burial clothing, and such copper artifacts as organ tubes, rings, kettles, and buckets. The large quantities of spindle whorls that were found reflect the documented importance of cotton and textiles in historic Coxoh communities. Excavations at the colonial center of Osumacinta, Chiapas, are important since the Zoque, who congregated at the mission, have not received much attention by archaeologists (Beristáin Bravo 1996). The Zoque built and maintained the colonial architecture and provided the Spanish priests and officials with food and household items. The project, which mapped the town and excavated the church and the separate monastery, found relatively little Spanish influence and material culture associated with the local Zoque. Excavated materials include large quantities of historic indigenous wares - unslipped colanders, comales, plates, bowls, tecomates, handled jars, and polychrome water jars - which continued from preconquest times (Beristáin Bravo 1996, pp. 95-128). Only a small percentage of the material consisted of majolica, glazed pottery, and porcelain. Twelve Christian graves, probably of indigenous people, were found under the interior floor of the church (Beristáin Bravo 1996, pp. 67-82). Burial artifacts included Spanish coins, jewelry, and evidence of clothing, such as buttons. Regional settlements and economics at Izalco, El Salvador In the colonial period, the Spanish conquered and occupied cacao-producing areas with substantial Pipil populations in western El Salvador. Europeans took over control of the local economy, large tribute-paying settlements, and agricultural land. Ethnohistoric and archaeological research there is significant for the study of European-indigenous interaction and the transformations in native economic and political life. Recent research has explored indigenous sites, Spanish churches, and urban and rural residences (Fowler 2006a). Regional surveys, settlement excava- tions, and a diachronic approach examine the Spanish conquest and the long-term effects of the growing global economy in western El Salvador (Sampeck 2007). At the settlement of Caluco, where masonry walls, towers, and decorated facades of an early colonial church (c. 1568) still stand (Fowler 1995; Verhagen 1997), archaeologists have identified colonial period residential foundations on the surface, such as wall lines containing cobbles and large stones. The gridded town's population grew around the church in the 17th century. The Spanish established the town with indigenous migrants during the congregación program, since the Ö Springer</page><page sequence="24">320 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 Postclassic population was small (Sampeck 2007, p. 274). The population relocations significantly impacted indigenous society, settlement patterns, and household organization. European ceramics, including olive jars and majolica, Chinese porcelain, and New World majolica were common at the site. A regional survey and excavation project in the Río Cenizas Valley in the Izalco region examined the effects of Spanish colonization, particularly local demographic shifts, material culture transformations, and the changing economy of the growing world system (Sampeck 2007). The importance of cacao production, large indigenous populations, and access to land led to the accelerated conquest of the region and its introduction to the global economy. The project investigated several Late Postclassic settlements in addition to historic sites dating from the colonial period to the 19th century and encountered large quantities of architecture and material culture. Colonial period archaeological contexts document the continuation of indigenous ceramic types with some modifications, the reduction of the numbers and kinds of pottery and stone tool types, the maintenance of the obsidian trade (but in lesser quantities), the wide availability of majolica and Ming porcelain related to high wealth and status, and elite native participation in the burgeoning capitalist economy. Written documents and diagnostic material culture contributed to the creation of four historic periods in the region: the conquest era (López phase, 1500-1580), early colonial period (Marroquin phase, 1580-1650), late colonial period (Shupan phase, 1650-1825), and the early Republican period (Tensun phase, 1825-1900). Specific indigenous, European, and Chinese pottery types marked these phases (Sampeck 2007, pp. 343-345). Each cultural phase was associated with a specific settlement pattern (Sampeck 2007, pp. 751-761). The once-dispersed indigenous populations clustered due to conflict and declining populations during the conquest. During the subsequent Spanish colonization period, the conquerors created towns and some native populations dispersed. Rural isolated settlements reflecting private land ownership and dispersed mestizo residences were apparent in the later part of the colonial period. The proliferation of haciendas and scattered industrial sites signaled economic and settlement changes in the 19th century. Colonialism in southern Mexico: Ocelocalco and Rancho Santa Cruz (Chihuitan) The small town of Ocelocalco is located in the Soconusco region of coastal Chiapas in southeastern Mexico (Gaseo 1989, 1997a) (Fig. 4). The area was well known for its cacao production in Postclassic to colonial times. The historic populations paid tribute in high-quality cacao and foreign merchants traveled to the area. The majority of the initial inhabitants of the town were indigenous people from local settlements, including a Late Postclassic site found several meters to the west. The Spanish conquered Soconusco in 1524. Soon after, native populations declined precipitously from Old World diseases (Gaseo 1992, p. 67). Ocelocalco' s maximum population was about 300 people around the end of the 17th century when it was the seat of a Catholic parish. Research at colonial period Ocelocalco (c. 1572-1767) generated a large number of publications on material culture, research methodology, £i Springer</page><page sequence="25">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 321 Fig. 4 Plan of Ocelocalco, Chiapas, Mexico (excavated structures in black; after Gaseo 1997b, Fig. 5.8, p. 47) II 4 -*° I &gt;&gt; 4%¿s. l' Ocelocalcao '' 0 50 m I' Nx economic organization, ethnicity, household structure, and social changes (Gaseo 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997a, 2005). Surprisingly, the economy of this historic town actually grew in the 17th century, increasing the socioeconomic status of the residents. The conquerors organized the town according to Spanish norms: they placed the church at the town center and aligned buildings to the cardinal directions. A grid plan may have been used, but no clearly defined streets were visible (Gaseo 1992, p. 68). A few Spaniards resided at Ocelocalco and indigenous people occupied most of the residences. Surveys located at least 56 structures at the site. Archaeologists excavated eight residential structures, the church, and a structure of unknown function. They also test pitted several other buildings (Gaseo 1991, p. 313, 1997a, p. 61). Most buildings had a single room, a stone foundation, and a perishable superstructure but no daub or ceramic roof tiles were recovered (Gaseo 1992, p. 69). Residences were not built in groups around patios as in the preceding Postclassic period. The building foundations were well preserved and associated artifact deposits were intact.

Investigators found carved stones from the church façade nearby and observed other sculpted pieces at a modern ranch in the vicinity. The residents probably constructed the church mainly from adobe, wood, and thatch. Enigmatic piles of stones associated with abundant refuse among the residences (Gaseo 1 992, p. 69) may represent tree or crop-growing areas. Hearth features were found in the interior and exterior of the houses (Gaseo 1992, p. 69). Some hearths contained whole pots with burned interiors. Residents probably used these cooking vessels to make crisp tortillas by heating them on the outside of pots filled with coals, as seen today in coastal Oaxaca. Indigenous artifacts such as ceramics resembling prehistoric pottery, in addition to select ground and chipped stone tools, continued to be made. Stone bifaces and arrowheads did not continue beyond the Late Postclassic period, however. All but one structure contained manos and metates. The coarse indigenous ceramics include cooking pots (ollas), water jars (tinajas), and tortilla griddles (comales) (Gaseo 1992, p. 70). Fabric-impressed comales are the most common ceramic type at Ocelocalco. The quantities of comales increased from Postclassic to historic times, and their higher frequencies are probably related to extensive seed drying for cacao production in the colonial period. Indigenous trade wares, such as fine gray paste ceramics, possibly from Oaxaca, and volcanic ash-tempered pottery, perhaps from highland Guatemala, attest to the continued importance of interregional interaction. Additionally, polychrome plates or shallow bowls with hallow supports continued from the Postclassic period, albeit in smaller frequencies. The inhabitants continuously produced ceramic net weights to acquire fish. Fish from local rivers was another important product from Soconusco. Investigators found ceramic spindle whorls for processing cotton thread only in earlier deposits, indicating that their residents imported textiles in historic times. Large quantities of Spanish goods from the excavations indicate widespread consumption of foreign material culture and local economic growth. Because of their success in cacao production and interregional trade ties, residents obtained these goods (Gaseo 1992), including majolica, glazed pottery from central Mexico, Guatemala, and Spain (including olive jars), Chinese porcelain, metal objects, and shards of glass (Gaseo 1992, p. 67, 1997a, p. 61). The inhabitants generally used the trade wares for serving food and not for cooking or storage. Chipped stone tools, found in low quantities, were largely replaced by metal tools. Marked differences in the consumption of Spanish goods separated households in the early colonial period (Gaseo 1997a, p. 62). This finding indicates the creation of socioeconomic differences after the town was established. It is possible that the differences in the consumption of European items were due to changes in the organization of cacao production, transformations in the colonial economy, or indigenous acculturation. Compared to indigenous residences excavated elsewhere in Mesoamerica, the people at Ocelocalco acquired larger amounts of Spanish-introduced goods (Gaseo 1991, p. 313). The Spanish items were important for traditional native household consumption such as serving vessels and cutting tools. The continuities in indigenous artifact types from Postclassic to colonial times also were related to the preservation of household activities and indigenous lifeways. At that time, the £l Springer</page><page sequence="27">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 323 only artifacts with no antecedents in Postclassic society were related to horses, including horse shoes and shoe nails. While acculturation of the native population did occur in the colonial period, their assimilation was not apparent until the 19th century. Zapotee people inhabited a small colonial period ranching and agricultural hamlet called Rancho Santa Cruz, a satellite village of Santo Domingo Chihuitan in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca (Zeitlin 2005; Zeitlin and Thomas 1997). The hamlet represented a colonial congregation of a few hundred individuals from small households scattered throughout the area (Zeitlin 2005, p. 154). The site is marked by the ruins of a late colonial period sugar refinery, low mounds, glazed pottery, brick fragments, and pieces of roof tile. Investigators examined the habitation zone and refuse deposits at the site, which rests on a high river terrace overlooking the Río de los Perros (Zeitlin and Thomas 1997, pp. 9-11). They excavated a house foundation comprising stones, postholes, and large quantities of artifacts. The evidence suggests that indigenous families, who subsisted by farming and hunting, lived in wattle and daub houses with tile roofs. Indigenous artifacts include pottery and stone tools made of chert, obsidian (although fewer in number in the colonial period), and quartzite. Spanish items include iron nails, a fishhook, and painted pottery. Archaeologists found copper sheet metal, which may have been of indigenous or European origin. The excavations encountered large amounts of animal bone from wild species such as deer, rabbit, armadillo, and iguana and from domesticated animals (Zeitlin and Thomas 1997, pp. 10-11). The colonial period Spanish ceramics at the site point to an occupation from the late 16th to the mid- 18th century. Documents from 1801 indicate that the site was abandoned by that time. More than 20 varieties of Spanish glazed earthen wares comprise 2% of the ceramic inventory (191 sherds), which was not expected for a rural hamlet of comparatively low-status residents (Zeitlin and Thomas 1997, pp. 11-12). Apparently, the native inhabitants actively sought imported Spanish majolica. There were substantial quantities of wheel-made glazed pottery and porcelain on the surface. About 80% of the glazed wares were common majolica that imitate finer ceramics produced in Mexico City. This poorer-quality majolica had less opaque glazes that exposed the ceramic paste, carelessly painted patterns, and colors that were copper green and brown rather than cobalt blue. Most of the colonial pottery at Rancho Santa Cruz, however, consisted of locally made indigenous wares that preserved vessel forms, decorations, and manufacturing techniques from the Postclassic period (Zeitlin and Thomas 1997, p. 12). These include indigenous fine white and unpainted fine gray wares, tripod supports with Postclassic-style motifs, including serpent heads, and white kaolin wares that were sometimes painted or slipped brown, although some were painted red as in the Postclassic. A new fine orange paste pottery, Tablón Orange ware, that appeared in the colonial period mimics Postclassic pottery decorations and forms (Fig. 5). This pottery, which could easily be mistaken for precontact types, was manufactured locally for indigenous use and trade (Zeitlin 2005, pp. 159-160; Zeitlin and Thomas 1997, pp. 12-13). The findings at Rancho Santa Cruz indicate an acculturated indigenous population.

Their economic success was probably due to their continued access to prime agricultural land (Zeitlin 2005, pp. 158-159). Nonetheless, the inhabitants relied on native foods, stone tools, and maintained local pottery. The acquisition of trade goods transformed native economic structures and social status. The natives acquired metal tools because of their usefulness, durability, and prestige. Similarly, people obtained painted majolica because they desired fine pottery to indicate high status. They obtained foreign goods through regional markets, as in the past, or they distributed goods through local economic networks (Zeitlin and Thomas 1997, pp. 14-16). Intercommunity redistribution may have continued and acquisitions from native merchants possibly increased. The missions of Tencoa, Honduras Surveys and excavations of historic Lenca sites in the colonial province of Tencoa, located in the Ulua River Valley in western Honduras (Fig. 6), have focused on the chronology and culture change of the lesser known Lenca people from protohistoric to historic times (c. 1400-1800; Weeks 1997; Weeks et al. 1987). Protohistoric Lenca chiefdoms were dispersed throughout the region. The settlement pattern consisted of large centers surrounded by smaller peripheral settlements and their agricultural fields.

Archaeologists focused on settlement patterns and Spanish missions in the historic period and studied site hierarchies, population movements, the establish- ment of churches, and hill fortresses. Protohistoric pottery continued in the colonial period, leading to problems of dating indigenous habitations. Documents provide information on both Lenca political and economic structures, which were of great interest to the Spanish, but they lack details of indigenous social organization, religion, and native adaptations to the conquest (Weeks et al. 1987, pp. 67-69). Documents on Lenca warfare, elite interaction, and settlement patterns also exist. Preliminary archaeological research examined nine sites. Tencoa was the most important early colonial period settlement with a large church, convent for Mercedarian friars, and a large population of La^nos by 1800, but only the remains of the church were found (Weeks et al. 1987, pp. 83-87). This historic site along the camino real was abandoned during severe flooding; thus, it is possible that inundations destroyed archaeological deposits and architecture. The investigators discovered a poorly preserved burial with blue and black glass beads in the church. The site of Viejo Celilac, which had a tributary population of 30 people in 1582, had 671 souls in 1801 before being abandoned (Weeks et al. 1987, p. 73). The site's</page><page sequence="30">326 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 poorly preserved rectangular visita church, made of adobe and stone rubble and surrounded by ancient mounds, dates primarily to the Late Classic and protohistoric periods. The small size and simple construction of the church reflect its peripheral location, its impermanent nature as a visita church, and the austerity of Mercedarian friars (Weeks 1997, pp. 95-96). The small site of Viejo Jalapa had approximately 30 individuals in 1582 (Weeks et al. 1987, p. 76). It was a pueblo de indios, or an indigenous occupied town, with 196 inhabitants in 1632. This site has the largest precontact architectural remains located in the survey, which date to the Early Classic and Late Postclassic periods. Viejo Jalapa had a circular settlement aggregation (Weeks et al. 1987, p. 77), perhaps for defense inside a palisade. Excavators found the probable remains of an early church and encountered adobe constructions (possibly precontact) in addition to protohistoric Lenca ceramics and colonial period glazed wares (Weeks et al. 1987, pp. 77-79). Yamala was situated in the floodplain of the Ulua Valley, near a hill fort destroyed in 1539 (Weeks et al. 1987, p. 79). The site, on the camino real had 30 tributaries in 1582 and 279 inhabitants in 1801. Archaeologists reported remnants of the masonry church façade near Late Postclassic mounds. Excavations revealed rubble footings for adobe walls and the remains of a ceramic tile floor. Ancient mounds surround the church and four areas have significant protohistoric occupations (Weeks et al. 1987, p. 80). One site is located on a high alluvial terrace, possibly a fortified Lenca site visited by conquistadors. Also, a "sun" design in red and black paint on a rock face, which has not been dated, is found about 6 km from the church (Weeks et al. 1987, pp. 80, 82). The results of the project point out the difficulties in establishing a chronology based on native material culture. Indigenous pottery and architecture (residential types and possibly adobe) continued in historic times, along with indigenous settlement patterns. Furthermore, the effects of Spanish colonialism are more evident in the later part of the colonial period when Spanish priests congregate the native populations in towns to control their labor and convert them to Christianity. Colonial economics at Tiquibalón (Ek Balam), Yucatán, Mexico Excavations of a Franciscan chapel and several historic structures at Tiquibalón, located outside the Maya ruins of Ek Balam, Yucatán (Hanson 2002), have recovered artifacts and architectural evidence of an elite Maya corporate group that controlled the use of space and resources. Buildings clustered near water sources and the church, and the inhabitants may have produced salt, añil dye, lime, pottery, or other commodities. Construction of the Spanish buildings began about 1545, and the inhabitants abandoned the site around 1605. The project found a large number of structures (approximately 75) with colonial period occupations (Hanson 2002, p. 377). Surveys located residences, watchtowers, kilns, cists, and other constructions (de France and Hanson 2008). Archaeologists mapped a simple ramada church, a friary, walkways, and a wall enclosing the church compound (Hanson 1995, p. 19). £i Springer</page><page sequence="31">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 327 The site is located near several sinkholes where inhabitants obtained water. The residents leveled natural outcrops of limestone to provide bases for structures (Hanson 2002, p. 378). Investigators found low apsidal platforms of uncut stone in the leveled areas that supported residences of perishable materials. Some residences located near the church housed Maya elites (Hanson 2002, p. 379). Many artifacts were found in structure interiors, including Maya ceramics, olive jar fragments, majolica, porcelain, human and animal bone, stone tools (such as arrowheads), copper bells, axes, rings, iron tools and hardware, four Mexican silver coins, and ornaments of shell and greenstone (Hanson 2002, p. 377). The use of Postclassic Maya pottery continued in the colonial period (Bey et al. 1998, pp. 116-118). Animal remains included deer, peccary, dog, turkey, pig, and chicken bones (de France and Hanson 2008). The artifacts indicate that the Yucatec Maya at Ek Balam participated in the Mesoamerican world system and in the developing capitalist world economy (de France and Hanson 2008; Hanson 2002). The paucity of wild animals, including reptiles and fish, and the increase in Old World domestic species replacing them in the Maya diet indicate that hunting and fishing became less important or more restricted in the colonial period. Spanish social, religious, and economic changes imposed on the local Maya decreased their traditional mobility and focused their labor toward the growing colonial economy. Conquest and death at Yucundaa (Teposcolula), Oaxaca, Mexico An archaeological project at Yucundaa-Pueblo Viejo de Teposcolula, a well- preserved Postclassic (1000-1521, Natividad phase) to colonial period (1521-1600, early Convento phase) settlement in Oaxaca, Mexico, uncovered architecture, refuse deposits, and burials. The findings provide important information on indigenous cultural continuities and changes following the conquest (Spores and Robles García 2007). The project examined the city's architectural organization and the impacts of the Spanish colonial period on the local population, including disease. Historical archaeology is important at Teposcolula due to the dearth of records on the Spanish conquest and colonization of the area. The site is located near the town of Teposcolula and covers a hill (290-450 ha) overlooking the Teposcolula River valley. At the time of the conquest, Yucundaa housed about 8,000 people and was a major polity ruling over sites within a 20-km radius (Spores and Robles García 2007, pp. 333-334; Stiver 2001). The city functioned as a Spanish regional capital until survivors from several epidemics moved to the valley floor by 1552. The central zone on the hilltop at Yucundaa contained a precontact Mixtee royal palace complex, a Great Plaza with associated buildings of Postclassic date, and historic church buildings (Spores and Robles García 2007, p. 336). Commoner residences were scattered on the hillslopes. The Great Plaza and associated elite structures continued to be occupied in the colonial period. Interestingly, the residents placed a large colonial period cemetery in this important Mixtee ceremonial plaza and not in the Spanish church. The Mixtee continuously occupied a royal residence into the colonial period. Although this compound contained numerous sherds of historic Mixtee pottery, the investigators found few fragments Ö Springer</page><page sequence="32">328 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 of Spanish pottery. Additionally, archaeologists did not find glass, metal, or European plant or animal remains in this building (Spores and Robles García 2007, p. 340). A commoner residence contained a cache of greenstone figurines placed under a hearth, probably to hide it from Dominican friars (Spores and Robles García 2007, p. 344). Investigators found the earliest Dominican church and monastery in the Mixtee region (Spores and Robles García 2007, pp. 347-349). Surprisingly, there are no known records pertaining to these constructions. In the church the main altar faces north and the main entrance is to the south, which contrasts with the east-west orientation of 16th century Dominican churches. The church walls and roof were made of stone and stamped earth and pebbles. Hundreds of black stone wedges may have decorated the upper friezes of the church. Archaeologists uncovered columnar support pedestals, altars, and the painted base of the baptismal font, together with its drain system, in the church. Wall paintings and carved stone medallions with Dominican symbols adorned the monastery. Only historic indigenous pottery was associated with the monastery, which points to its early colonial period date (c. 1538). The excavations at the site demonstrate that although indigenous customs continued to be practiced after the conquest, Spanish rule and influence transformed their material culture and behavior. Mixtee polychrome ceramics continued in great quantities in the colonial period, but flowery designs and geometric motifs replaced indigenous religious icons. The Mixtee modified pre-Columbian architecture with arched doorways, European-style doors, and Old World decorative elements, such as crosses, flowers, and vegetation. The archaeologists discovered an early colonial period burial ground with hundreds of skeletons at Yucundaa (Spores and Robles García 2007, pp. 339, 347). The cemetery was near the west compound of the Great Plaza and covers an area of about 1350 m2. The inhabitants dug the burials through the plaster floors of the Great Plaza. This area was connected to Mixtee elites, the ancestors, and ceremonial space, which differs from Christian burial in churches. Furthermore, skeletons were very well preserved. The individuals buried may have been victims of epidemics in Oaxaca from 1530 to 1545. Two to five individuals were placed in the same pit side by side or on top of one another. They also placed individuals in the graves before the onset of rigor mortis. Also, no burial offerings were found, possibly reflecting hasty interment. The burials indicate Christian practices and Spanish influence since the dead were laid facing east or west with their arms crossing the abdomen. Late colonial times, independence, and renewed conquest Recent archaeological research in Mesoamerica has focused on indigenous societies and culture change from the end of the colonial period to the 19th century. Far from being understood through documents alone, the ethnic groups, cross-cultural interaction, and indigenous social transformations of the late colonial and Republican periods are being illuminated by historical archaeology.

The findings provide new insights on social inequality, the causes and effects of the Caste War of Yucatán, and cross-cultural interaction and culture change of remote unconquered Maya. Research on these periods and peoples is important for the understanding of some of the greatest transformations of indigenous cultures in Mesoamerican history. Maya survival in Yucatán: Hacienda Tabi and Yaxcabá Archaeological investigations at the abandoned sugar plantation of Hacienda Tabi in Yucatán examine the material and spatial correlates of Mestizo elite control over rural Maya laborers before the Mexican Revolution (Meyers 2005) (Fig. 3). Written and oral histories do not provide adequate information on Maya socioeconomic differences and how these asymmetries affected Maya social structure, labor organization, and residential patterns (Meyers 2005, pp. 112-113). Estate owners invested in machinery and large stone buildings. The resident Maya and Mestizo laborers had different occupations, house types, and socioeconomic statuses (Meyers 2005, pp. 116-117). Inhabitants rapidly abandoned Hacienda Tabi during the Mexican Revolution, and they did not reoccupy the site nor destroy it by later construction. Thus, the well-preserved residences and intact artifact deposits provide a prime opportunity to examine the material correlates of social rank. Architecture and artifacts in houses of different sizes, structural complexity, and location reflect socioeconomic status and power. For instance, the elites lived in masonry buildings and low-status workers resided in thatch huts (Meyers and Carlson 2002). Archaeologists compared the distribution of architectural types at the hacienda to associated ceramics to learn about the control of Maya labor. Despite elite control over their labor, the Maya alternately fled the settlement, employed everyday forms of resistance, and joined rebellions (Meyers and Carlson 2002). Tabi was a cattle ranch and sugar mill beginning in the late colonial period. In 1848, the Caste War of Yucatán halted its economic importance (Meyers and Carlson 2002, p. 231). The principal habitation of Hacienda Tabi, however, dates from 1860 to 1914. Indentured Maya laborers at that time lived at the sugar plantation to work and acquire shelter and land, or they were forced to reside at the hacienda for debt peonage (Meyers 2005). A masonry wall enclosed the central part of the hacienda, which consisted of a large house, a church, stables, a sugar mill, a well that provided water for the community, and a "great yard" (Meyers 2005, p. 122). The hacienda layout and its efficacy for social control were patterned after colonial period towns. Elites designed the size, layouts, and ornamentation of their buildings to impress and control the movements of the workers (Meyers and Carlson 2002). Additionally, property walls were low and the entrances to Maya houses faced the streets to allow surveillance by the overseers (Meyers and Carlson 2002, p. 240). Four main streets were laid out on the cardinal points in the workers' village, and 14 rectangular blocks contained at least 124 Maya houses placed near the streets. Investigators identified four different house types: Type A houses were the largest â Springer</page><page sequence="34">£} Springer 330 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 and had rrjasonry walls and floors of stone and plaster; Type B dwellings were constructed of low masonry facades, rubble rear walls, and lime mortar floors; Type C houses were on plastered masonry platforms and had lime mortar floors; and Type D structures were constructed on a ring base of dry rubble. The large, well- constructed Type A houses were typically located near the main streets and plazas surrounding the center of the hacienda. Hence, the largest houses at Tabi were conspicuous to everyone using the roads leading to the hacienda center. Different ceramic types correlated with house construction (Meyers 2005, pp. 126-128). All Maya households utilized coarse red or white-slipped pottery made by adjacent Maya communities. Type A residences contained larger quantities of imported ceramics, including white earthenware pottery from England and the U.S. The investigators believe that Type A and perhaps Type B structures housed salaried workers; the other house types sheltered Maya wage earners (jornaleros) or indebted laborers (Meyers 2005, p. 129). Salaried workers had a fixed income and more privileges than wage earners because of their increased status and greater responsibility in organizing hacienda labor. Salaried workers included men in charge of running the hacienda while the owner was absent. Apparently, the salaried workers used more ornate, permanent homes and fine pottery to reflect their higher socioeconomic status. At the same time, these material symbols provided incentives and hope for lower-status workers to remain at the hacienda to gain a better life (Meyers 2005, pp. 129-132). Settlement pattern studies and surface collections at historic Maya sites near Yaxcabá, Yucatán, combined with documentary information, shed light on Maya regional political and economic changes from the colonial period to the 20th century (Fig. 3). This research has assessed the causes and effects of the 19th century Caste War of Yucatán with archaeological data (Alexander 1997, 1998, 2004). The archaeological record of the Yaxcabá parish yielded important information on Maya long-term agrarian strategies, rural Maya resistance and accommodation to changing socioeconomic conditions brought on by Creole elites, and indigenous household survival strategies, all of which were poorly understood historically. Documents, local inhabitants, and intensive survey helped identify settlement sizes and locations, including towns (Category I) to residential clusters (Category IV; Alexander 2004, p. 72). The settlements were plotted on a regional map, following a regional chronology, also based on local history, that consisted of seven phases from c. 1547 to 1900. The chronology helped sort out demographic shifts in relation to politics, economic changes, and epidemics in the area. Evidence for variations in political and economic organization and communities, including towns, haciendas, and agricultural households, was more evident in the archaeo- logical rather than the documentary record (Alexander 2004, p. 1 15). In the first half of the 19th century, elaborate masonry buildings belonged to both Maya and Creole elites, Maya agricultural communities increased in number, and the economy diversified with the addition of cattle ranches. As settlements and agriculture took up more land at this time, population dispersal occurred. Additionally, house lots became more intensively utilized for cultivation, animal husbandry, and household activities (Alexander 2004, pp. 148-149).</page><page sequence="35">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 331 The project investigated three sites from different settlement categories. The first settlement, Mopilá, was a large Category II site consisting of an extensive town with house platforms surrounding a church. The town was constructed on a Spanish colonial grid system (Alexander 2004, pp. 124-125). A Category III site, Cetelac, consisted of a hacienda with a main house, church, walled house plots, house platforms, and pre-Columbian mounds and walls. Cacalchén was a Category IV site with a central shrine, walled enclosures, house platforms, and perhaps a ramada church. Architectural features identified at these sites include masonry houses, stone house foundations, animal pens, rock piles, and wells (Alexander 2004, pp. 124- 137). Artifacts collected from the surface of a series of houses included chert tools, obsidian, shell, metal (nails, latches, hinges), bone, grinding stones, ceramics (indigenous and imported), and glass (Alexander 2004, pp. 137-147). The findings provide insights on the Caste War and the political and economic changes at Yaxcabá from the colonial period to the late 19th century. Access to agricultural land in a burgeoning capitalist economy under Spanish rule was a significant variable in Maya resistance over time (Alexander 2004, pp. 152-160). The Maya dispersed their agricultural plots to resist colonial rule by hiding their fields and maintaining land ownership. Settlements were nucleated or dispersed, depending on the local demography and political organization. The increase in haciendas, masonry buildings, and land ownership in the 19th century signaled the growth of socioeconomic inequalities in the region. These factors, in addition to population growth, led to variations in land use, subsistence practices, loss of local indigenous political power, and indigenous resistance. Maya resistance in Yaxcabá likely developed early in settlements where indigenous subsistence needs and land ownership collided with the growth of Creole cattle haciendas and political expansion. Unconquered Maya along the Pasión River, Peten, Guatemala A project in southwestern Peten, Guatemala, recently examined culture contact and Lacandon Maya social transformations in the remote rainforest (Palka 1997, 1998, 2005a, b; Palka and López Olivares 1992). In the 19th century, the nascent Guatemalan and Mexican republics undertook a renewed conquest of the Maya lowlands. Increased interaction with outsiders impacted the lives of the Lacandon Maya, who remained comparatively isolated. At that time, the Lacandon experi- enced the effects of colonization witnessed earlier in Mesoamerica, including conflict, displacement, disease, economic change, and social transformations. Many Lacandon remained autonomous, however, and they controlled foreign contact and trade for their benefit. The Lacandon maintained indigenous lifeways while accepting foreign trade goods and influences. Surveys discovered several 19th century Lacandon Maya sites in the Pasión River region with the help of local informants. The sites consist of small, single- family residential clearings in the rainforest. Informants knew the site locations, and they were easily identified by clusters of large fruit trees and historic artifacts just under the surface. Excavations uncovered one house floor and concentrations of domestic artifacts at a site called El Caobal located near the Maya ruins of Dos Pilas ö Springer</page><page sequence="36">332 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 Fig. 7 Historic Lacandon Maya ceramic incense burner, Peten, Guatemala (rim height 15 cm; drawing by Jack Scott) (Palka 2005a). No structures were found, which would be difficult to identify since they were made from perishable materials, but buried metal knives, machetes, and Lacandon pottery were recovered. Diagnostic indigenous ceramics (flat-rimmed utilitarian bowls), lithics (chert blades and side-notched arrowheads), and distinctive incense burners with anthropomorphic heads (Fig. 7) similar to ethnographic types allowed for the secure identification of the Lacandon inhabitants. Metal and glass also were worked into tools of native form, such as glass arrowheads. The excavations also recovered small medicine bottles and wine bottles. Historic Lacandon incense burners and ceramics, as well as material culture from other post-conquest Maya, have been excavated from the upper layers at ancient Maya sites (Masson 1997, p. 310; Morales 2000, pp. 924, 941, 944; Palka 2005a). The historic artifacts are sometimes mistakenly dated to the Postclassic period. Traditional Maya lifeways and ritual, including the burning of incense in sacred Maya ruins, continued in unconquered territories well into the historic period. The archaeological findings indicate that the 19th-century Lacandon Maya retained cultural, economic, and political autonomy in their wilderness settlements. The Lacandon, however, were not "holdovers" from the past as often believed. Their society changed considerably due to contact with foreigners in the 19th century. The increased acceptance of Old World plants and metal tools transformed Lacandon plant cultivation and diet. Mangos and bananas became important foods and the Lacandon created more extensive fields and orchards. From their remote, autonomous settlements the Lacandon managed outside contact and acquired trade goods according to indigenous norms. For instance, they desired metal cutting tools such as machetes, axes, and knives to supplement indigenous stone £} Springer</page><page sequence="37">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 333 implements. They also traded for medicines and painted European serving vessels. Guns, metal containers, Christian artifacts, such as rosary beads and crosses, and European clothing were of lesser importance. Hence, the Lacandon did not want these items at this time and they relied on native material culture and technology. Maya Caste War refugees: San Pedro, Belize, and Tikal, Peten, Guatemala During the Caste War of Yucatán, Maya "pacíficos" migrated to neutral territory in northern Belize and Peten, Guatemala, around 1850 (Dornan 2004; Yaeger et al. 2004). Archaeologists discovered one 19th-century Yucatec Maya village called San Pedro Siris in western Belize. A diverse project examined the demography, settlement pattern, and social organization of the San Pedro Maya. Investigators focused on ethnicity and how the Yucatec Maya migrants were slowly incorporated into the political and economic networks of colonial British Honduras through both indigenous agency and colonial policy (Dornan 2004). According to documents, the village was one of the main Maya settlements in the region, with 300-400 inhabitants. The settlement had public buildings such as a church, jailhouse, a large fiesta house, and barracks. It is possible that San Pedro was home to mestizos, creóles, and Africans as well (Dornan 2004, p. 5). The British welcomed Maya immigrants into western and northern Belize because of labor shortages. The government also wanted to provide a buffer zone between settlements in Belize and the bellicose Maya in Yucatán (Yaeger et al. 2004, pp. 104-105). The British authorities granted requests for arms by the Maya for protection in the remote communities. However, colonists saw the Maya communities as well as their Caste War neighbors to the north as threats to their safety. The first military incursion to subdue the San Pedro Maya failed, but eventually a reinforced British army sacked this and other Maya settlements. The Maya eventually returned to their burned villages and an uneasy peace was maintained through intermittent contact and trade. The Maya settlements became more connected to British towns in the 1920s as the British constructed railways and logging roads into the interior. However, the San Pedro Maya fled their village following increasing conflicts with outsiders at this time. Locating these historic Maya villages has been difficult for archaeologists since the Maya built their residences of perishable materials and dispersed their settlements in the forest (Yaeger et al. 2004, p. 106). Moreover, the forest quickly reclaims settlements and leaf cover obscures the thin historic artifact deposits. Luckily, local informants had information regarding the whereabouts of the villages and lifeways of the San Pedro Maya, leading to the discovery of 19th-century sites. The inhabitants also knew of surface concentrations of bottles, pottery, and metal tools that marked the locations of historic sites. Archaeologists carried out surface collections and shovel tests at San Pedro (Yaeger et al. 2004, pp. 106-107). These operations recovered thousands of well- preserved historic artifacts. One excavation encountered a possible wall line of stones and artifacts probably associated with exterior versus interior domestic activities. Excavating long, narrow trenches through the thin soil yielded buried features, including lines of cobbles, shallow hearth pits, sheet middens, and activity Ô Springer</page><page sequence="38">334 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 areas. Horizontal excavations encountered concentrations of artifacts and cobbles that marked possible residences or occupational refuse. Two burial pits excavated into bedrock may be part of a cemetery. The artifacts recovered at San Pedro include gun parts, machetes, kerosene lamp fragments, scissors, alcohol bottles, refined white earthenware with blue transfer print designs, china, cast iron bake ovens, local coarse ceramics with an orange slip or a gray wash, basin-shaped grinding stones, religious medallions, and tools made from worked glass (Dornan 2004, pp. 101-102; Yaeger et al. 2004, p. 1 1 1). Much of the material culture pertains to 19th-century Maya domestic activities. However, the presence of guns and machetes illustrates Maya resistance to colonialism and their need for protection. Interestingly, bowls formed the majority of the local and imported ceramics, which is interpreted as an ethnic Maya preference for the consumption of stews. The artifacts indicate Maya economic autonomy and native choices in the acquisition of European goods. The Maya maintained their traditional culture, but they accepted outside materials and foreign influences to better their lives. One of the earliest historical archaeology projects in Mesoamerica examined indigenous lifeways, ethnic identity, and culture change at a 19th-century Maya village within the ruins of Tikal, Peten, Guatemala (Moholy-Nagy in press). Archaeologists noted several clusters of historic artifacts, such as whole coarse earthenware vessels, metates, bottles, and metal tools, and stone hearth features during site reconnaissance. Historic finds include the remnants of old chiclero and explorer camps. À high concentration of historic domestic objects and stone hearths near non-native fruit and palm trees adjacent to the Tikal Aguada probably marks the location of the 19th-century Maya village of "Tical" mentioned by explorers. Refugees from the Caste War of Yucatán and people with social ties to San Pedro more than likely resided at Tikal. After completing surface surveys at the Maya village, investigators excavated a historic structure discovered near the western edge of the village. This platform consisted of low walls made of roughly shaped stones and chunks of limestone (Moholy-Nagy in press). Excavations recovered 19th-century artifacts such as fragments of indigenous ceramic bowls and water jars, metal tools, and glass bottles. Archaeologists found a three-stone hearth along with a thin plaster floor inside the building platform. It is possible that this structure functioned as a communal building or a small church. Workers found a brass church bell during the construction of the airstrip nearby, which may originally have belonged to this structure. Three decades later, archaeologists studying Lacandon Maya culture change investigated residences in the historic village (Palka 2005a, p. 150). Reports from the 19th century indicate that Lacandon Maya resided near the ruins of Tikal, which was near the eastern geographical extension of this ethnic group. Seven Yucatec Maya and three Lacandon Maya families supposedly made up the village, according to one explorer's account. The excavation of the village and the separation of Yucatec and Lacandon Maya material culture could lead to insights on Maya cross- cultural interaction and the delineation of material remains of different ethnic groups. During the surface survey with metal detectors, several clusters of historic artifacts around hearthstones signaled the presence of 19th-century houses. £} Springer</page><page sequence="39">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 335 Archaeologists placed test pits adjacent to the hearthstones of each residence and in scattered trash deposits outside the houses (Palka 2005a, pp. 154-162) and discovered large numbers of artifacts on house floors and in thin trash deposits around them. The sherds from indigenous pottery represent water jars, pitchers, small bowls, and large pots; some pottery fragments exhibit eroded red paint and modeled designs such as rope straps. Metal tools consist of machete fragments, knives, axe heads, pots, gun parts, and projectile points. Like at historic sites elsewhere, metal artifacts were transformed into useful objects such as a piece of an iron pot made into a scraper and a machete tip fashioned into a spear point. Surprisingly, the excavations encountered a large quantity of stone tools. Archaeologists recovered chert scrapers, flakes, and hammer stones in addition to reused ancient Maya grinding stones, chert bifaces, and obsidian blades. The material for these tools was readily acquired, and the stone tools were easy to make and use. Trade items include sherds of imported white earthenware with painted designs, stoneware pottery, medicine bottles, and metal jewelry. One medicine bottle was originally from New York and white earthenware pottery appear to be from the United States, England, and Mexico. The investigations at the village did not find conclusive evidence of Lacandon Maya occupation. Documents mention Lacandon in the area in the 19th century, and archaeologists recently recovered historic Lacandon-type incense burners in rubble inside temples at the neighboring site of El Zotz (S. Houston, personal communication, 2008). It is possible that Lacandon residences were not discovered or the material culture of the Lacandon at Tikal differed from the artifacts found elsewhere (Palka 2005a). The indigenous ceramics indicate close ties with the Yucatec Maya of Belize and Yucatán and with the Itzaj Maya of San José, Peten. The metal tools, guns, medicine bottles, and white earthenware with painted designs may have been obtained largely through contacts with Maya in Belize. The large amounts of de facto artifact deposits in the historic houses indicate that the structures may have been abandoned rapidly with no one returning. These deposits may attest to violence in the frontier and Maya fleeing their homes. Alternatively, the historic Maya may have left behind items of little value to them, or these goods were readily available at their new settlements. Conclusion: Contributions of Mesoamerican historical archaeology The archaeology of indigenous historic sites in Mesoamerica has contributed significantly to the study of indigenous culture change, especially where written sources lack information on native societies. In many cases, archaeology provides the only data on historic sites and indigenous peoples or it nicely complements historical and ethnographic information. Furthermore, when documentary sources are available, archaeologists have combined ethnohistory and archaeology to create nuanced reconstructions of past human behavior in different regions, including household economies, interregional trade, and diet. The results indicate that different types of interaction and effects on indigenous societies occurred in the stages of conquest, colonization, and independence from Spain. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="40">336 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 The Spanish conquest brought demographic and settlement changes to indige- nous populations at different times and places in Mesoamerica. In conquered regions like central Mexico in the 1500s, large numbers of people died from conflict and disease. The Spanish relocated indigenous populations to colonial towns, but these resettlement plans were not always successful and people remained in the peripheries. The demographic changes also reflect the great political and economic changes introduced by the Spanish, particularly indigenous labor control, tribute demands, and evangelization. The conquerors also truncated long-distance indig- enous trade systems, and they quickly incorporated economically important indigenous goods such as salt and cacao into the colonial economy. Depopulation and early economic transformations led to environmental change such as erosion in the Patzcuaro region. The introduction of Old World goods and foods, mainly pottery and metal tools, transformed local native economies throughout Mesoamer- ica. However, the presence of European goods was negligible in many rural areas. Native items, particularly ceramics and stone implements, survived or were little transformed in form, manufacture, or function. The effects of the conquest were less apparent socially and materially as the distance from colonial towns increased. In other rural zones, including Peten, Guatemala, indigenous cultural autonomy prevailed and the impacts of European colonization were felt later. Subsequently, the colonial period brought dramatic economic and social adjustments to indigenous societies. At the same time, indigenous cultural elements, including domestic life and local economies, continued with fewer changes. The number of colonial sites across Mesoamerica increased at that time, bringing in larger numbers of indigenous people to Spanish colonial economic and political networks. The Spanish created towns and churches, like in Yucatán, reducing indigenous mobility. However, indigenous people moved back to or remained in rural areas in other instances, such as El Salvador. Spanish artifacts, including ceramics, metal, and glass beads, became more common, even at peripheral sites. Spanish architecture and settlement plans became more evident, but the construc- tions often reflect indigenous culture and materials, particularly in rural areas. Indigenous people throughout Mesoamerica entered regional exchange spheres to acquire the then widely available foreign goods. Natives were economically successful when they had access to agricultural land, like Tehuantepec, and important products such as cacao in colonial Soconusco. Transculturation occurred across Mesoamerica at that time as indigenous people accepted foreign items and cultural elements, but they retained various aspects of indigenous lifeways. Indigenous survivalisms included household production, material culture, and local exchange economies. Natives in the peripheries, especially in the Maya lowlands, resisted Spanish economic and political domination by trading with unconquered peoples, preserving domestic production and social organization, maintaining native religious practices, moving into unconquered areas, or by rebelling. Republican-era Mesoamerica heralded extensive native culture transformation, particularly with regard to land use and sociopolitical organization, as modern economies and governments formed. The new nations attempted to exercise greater* control over productive lands and indigenous labor, including rural areas. The proliferation of post-independence haciendas and cattle ranches, in addition to £} Springer</page><page sequence="41">J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 337 expanding governments, conflicted with indigenous land-use patterns and owner- ship, contributing to legal conflicts, rebellion, and the Caste War of Yucatán. Mestizo elites also forced natives to work on the private estates. Material divisions regarding status and power became more widely apparent, even in peripheries. Elites marked their wealth and access to labor by constructing large, permanent buildings and acquiring exotic goods such as painted pottery. Republican governments and growing industries, including logging, cattle ranching, and plantations, drew rural indigenous populations into the burgeoning global economy and post-colonial rule. Rural populations had direct access to foreign goods through trade with the growing numbers of settlements, explorers, and missionaries. Native Mesoamerican people in the peripheries, like in Peten and Belize, experienced increased violence, displacement, disease, evangelization, and economic subjuga- tion in this period of "new conquest." They responded by flight, accommodation, and resistance. With regard to method and theory, Mesoamerican historical archaeology has contributed to the study of colonialism, ethnogenesis, world systems, cultural ecology, and political economy. Extensive archaeological research on Spanish architecture, European society in the New World, and indigenous culture in colonial cities continues, but there has been a shift in the discipline with the increasing number of investigations of indigenous sites, cross-cultural interaction, and culture process. Several projects developed long-term, regional perspectives in the study of indigenous cultural stability and change, with a clear advantage in using the combination of archaeology, history, and ethnography. The identification of sites has benefited from the use of maps, documents, informants, surface collecting, and metal detectors. Additionally, the results of several research projects indicate that "Postclassic" or "protohistoric" indigenous behaviors and material culture continue in historic times, necessitating a reconsideration of chronologies and the timing of Spanish colonization and its effects on native societies. Future archaeological research will refine regional chronologies, as well as achieve a greater understand- ing of native religion, diet, demography, and impacts on the environment in the historic period as the field grows. Perhaps these projects will further subdivide processes of culture contact and indigenous culture change in the stages discussed in this article. Large gaps remain in our knowledge of colonialism and its impacts on native Mesoamerican societies over extensive periods in large regions. Without historical archaeology in Mesoamerica, we would know less about the regional impacts of conquest, the organization of rural indigenous populations, everyday life in colonial settlements, or the development of contemporary indigenous cultures. In particular, new information on European colonialism in the New World, the effects of conquest and cross-cultural interaction on indigenous societies, the impacts of capitalism and the growing global economy, rural indigenous lifeways, native accommodation to colonial rule, and indigenous cultural survivalisms in different social and temporal contexts came to light from historical archaeology. Additionally, the variability in colonial policies and indigenous reactions to colonialism through time and space become more visible from archaeological data. The dispersal of indigenous settlements, post-colonial ecolog- ical changes, continuation of native lifeways in extensive unconquered territories, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="42">£l Springer 338 J Archaeol Res (2009) 17:297-346 and successful native economic adaptations, for example, are particularly intriguing findings that challenge models of colonial indigenous societies based on documen- tary data. Clearly, historical archaeology is essential for comprehending past indigenous lifeways, regional histories, the creation of contemporary native societies, and the development of the modern world.
