<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY. By the late EUGENIO RIGNANO. ARISTOTLE'S definition of purpose is well known. The purpose is that towards which action is directed; it must therefore exist as a notion before action begins. This definition which is evidently limited to the conscious acts of man, in other words to a very restricted category of the purposive manifestations of life, has been and still is the principal reason why many biologists are unwilling to admit any kind of teleology in vital processes in general. It seems to them that to accept it would be to fall into the most out-of-date anthropomorphism; to compare artificially and violently facts so fundamentally diflerent as are, in their opinion, biological and physiological processes on the one hand, and conscious psychical facts on the other. It is now at last possible to define Finalism in such a way as to remove from the definition every suspicion of anthropomorphism and at the same time to include in it all living processes; which may be consequently called finalist without there being any fear of our arriving at a false, anthropomorphic view, or at any artificial comparison of facts which are essentially diflerent from one another. The main point is that this definition should include, as a particular case, the conscious acts of man, which alone fall under Aristotle's restricted definition. With the object of discovering this more extended definition, let us consider a few of the most fundamental manifestations of life which are commonly called finalist; for example the ontogenetic process, viz., the development of the embryo. What do we see ? This fact of very great importance; that, even if the external cir- cumstances under which the development of the fertilised ovum begins, are profoundly and essentially modified (for example, by the reversal of the position of the ovum or the compression between two plates of the first blastomeres into which it divides, so that they all spread out into a flat layer, but when the plate is taken away, collect together again in another arrangement; or even when we kill or remove some of these blastomeres, or isolate some from others) -even when this is done, we always obtain, with many species, -exactly the same form of the developed organism, as if these pro- found changes in the circumstances of development had not been made. In the. course of development, particularly in the early stage, we can remove the limbs just beginning to form, we can take away certain organs in process of formation, we can even cut away the</page><page sequence="2">336 EUGENIO RIGNANO: first beginnings of the head: in spite of all this, the fully developed organism will be just as complete as if it had developed under normal conditions. But we may also consider the phenomena of regeneration in the adult organism. A change in external conditions so drastic as to result in the amputation or the loss of a certain member or organ, causes in many cases reactive processes to take place of such a kind as fully to restore the organism to its original form. In many cases, the processes serving to re-form the amputated organ (for example, the eye lens of the Triton or the anterior part of the alimentary canal of Tubifex rivolorum) are completely different from the processes which brought about the first formation of the organ, and even proceed from tissues of different embrvological origin: organs or tissues of eqtodermic origin regenerate themselves from tissues of endo- or mesodermic origin, and vice versa. In cases of regeneration by " regression " (Riickbildung) or "renewal by differentiation", (Umdifferenzierung), the part remaining after the amputation of an important part of the organism loses the histological differentiation which it already has, 'falls back again into the state of a mass of undifferentiated cells, and once more takes up the process of forming the new organism, reproducing it in a form identical with the original. In all these cases, therefore, we see that, when external circumstances change for an organismri, the reaction processes pro- duced by the change of circumstances also change, but that the final result of these processes, however daifferent they may be as compared with one another, always remains the same. When we pass from the biological processes of generation and regeneration to physiological processes properly so-called, we see that the adult organism remains unaltered for months and years, even under the continual action of constantly changing physico- chemical environmental conditions, which, on the other hand, con- tinually- alter inorganic bodies exposed to the same conditions. When, for example, the man from the plains is transferred to a high mountain climate, or when a man accustomed to fresh air is forced to remain for many holirs in a closed space heavily charged with. carbonic acid, we find that the neuro-muscular processes of respira- tion are changed, but the final result of these processes remains that to which the original processes led, namely, the maintenance in the blood of the same quantity of oxygen as before. If any organism is infected at one time with one bacillus, at another time with another, each of which secretes a different specific toxin, the organism produces in the one case a certain anti-toxin, in the other a different anti-toxin: but the result of the two different series of phenomena by which the organism reacts to each of the infections by neutralis- ing the respective toxins, is identical in the two cases, 'and is the re-establishment of the normal physiological condition of the healthy organism as it was before either infection. In all these cases, we find that the final result of the functioning of a certain organ or of all</page><page sequence="3">THE CONCEPT OF PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY. 337 the organs together-functioning which changes with external circumstances-is unique and always the same: that is to say, the unvaried conservation of the organism itself, which, without such functioning, would be profoundly altered, as is seen in the decom- position of the dead body after the lapse of a few hours. If an infusorium be irritated with carmine, an experiment due to Jennings, the animal executes first a certain series of movements, then a second series of different movemnents, then a third and a fourth series; nevertheless'all the series, although different from one another, lead always to the same result, namely, to withdraw the infusorium from the action of the new factor which has come into the environ- ment in which it is destined to live. The same response is found in the case of every animal, whether higher or lower, to every physico- chemical alteration modifying its accustomed environment; the response may be various, the motion that of avoidance or approach, according to the nature of the alteration, but all these series of re- active movements, however different among themselves, lead to the same uanique final result, namely, to bring the animal back to its habitual environment. And so on, and so forth. What do these few examples, which could easily be multiplied, teach us ? The following most important fact, namely, that when the conditions under which these life-processes take place are altered, the processes themselves change, but only in such a manner as to keep their result the same. This is not the case with natural inorganic processes. The rusting of an iron mineral, the metamorphic transformation of a rock, the melting of a glacier, the condensation of rain, the outburst of a thunderstorm, the fall of an avalanche, the beginning and development of a volcanic eruption, all these are physico-chemical processes, and when the external' circumstances under which they take place are changed, they themselves change, but the final result which they produce is also changed. We therefore have here a general distinctive characteristic, en- tirely oUjective, and in no respect subjective or anthropomorphic, which enables us to divide the whole of the processes of the external world ,into two great categories-the teleological and the ateleological. If when a change occurs in 'the circumstances under which a process takes place, the process itself changes, and also the final result of it, the process is ateleological: if with a change of circumstances the process changes, but in such a way that the final result of it remains the same, it will fall into the category of teleological processes. The finalist natture of these processes is determined, in other words, simplv and solelv bv the invariance of the final result to which they normally lead by their reacting, with self-modification, to changed circumstances. It appears to us difficult to imagine a criterion wore objective and 'more impersonal than this. We are nlow able to give, in place of the Aristotelian, the following 23</page><page sequence="4">338 EUGENIO RIGNANO: definition of purpose: purpose is the final and invariable result to which certain processes normally lead, by reacting, with self-modification, to changed circumstances. This definition includes also, as is easily seen, the conscious acts of man for which alone Aristotle made his definition. If during a cold winter man covers his body with wool and warms his house, while during the hot summer he wears light clothing and takes refuge in the mountains, he evidentlv acts, according to Aristotle's definition, with a purpose in view which exists in the state of a notion before action commences; but according to the more com- prehensive definition of purpose which we have given, there is allow- ance for two different kinds of reaction to the changed environment, two kinds of reaction which, although altogether different, have both the same single result of maintaining the organism at about the same temperature in both cases. In the same way, a man of business acts with a view to profit, of which he has already a clear notion when embarking on any undertaking; but his behaviour mav be called finalist, according to our definition, inasmuch as we see that a whole series of his actions in dealing with his colleagues, however much these actions may differ in accordance with the circumstances, nevertheless normally lead (apart from certain exceptional cases, then called failures) to the same single result, an increase in his income. The case we are bere discussing of a purely psychological concept which, once suitably enlarged, mav be also applied to truly biological and physiological processes, is not the only one which, in recent times, has enlarged and ihore exactly formulated our conception of life. Another case, for instance, is that of the concept we have of memory. It is well known that certain eminent biologists have boldly advanced the notion that ontogen0tic development, with its fundamental biogenetic law of the ontogenetic re&amp;'apitulation of phylogenesis, is none other than a mnemonic process, bv virtuie of which the developing organism simply recollects the various phylo- genetic stages through which the interminable series of its ancestors passed in the whole course of biological evolution. Without touch- ing upon the brilliant, if somewhat vague, intuitions of Butler, Haeckel, Orr, and Cope, we may refer here to the famous paper of the. great physiologist, Ewald Hering: " Ueber das Gediichtnis als eine allgemeine Funktion der organisierten Materie ", and the much- discussed work of tI4e late biologist, Richard Semon: " Die Mnemne als erhaltendes Prinzip im Wechsel des organischen Geschebens ". But we well know the lively opposition wbich this bold comparison found in the case of the majority of biologists, who, not without justice, if the truth be told, ascribed to the comparison no other importance than that of a harmless metaphor. For conscious memory, e.q., of the.view of tbe Gulf of Naples, is, at first sight, a very different phenomenon from the development of the tissues and organs of a vertebrate from a minute initial cell, the fertilised ovum. This arose from the fact that the mnemonic phenomenon was</page><page sequence="5">THE CONCEPT OF PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY. 339 taken only in the restricted sense of a conscious recollection of a given perception in the past. We mav, however, define the mne- monic property as follows: it consists in the reproduction, from internal causes, of physiological and biological processes in general, for the first production of which the activity of the external world was necessary. This definition includes not only, and quite obviously, the case of purely psychical memory, but also the most various and fundamental biological and physiological phenomena. Ontological development, for example, would simply reproduce, through internal causes potentially present in the fertilised ovum (or " specific accumulations " proportionately and gradually deposited in the germ substance),' the phylogenetic transformations which originally needed the modifying influence of the external en- vironment. Thus, if we accustom an herbivorous animal little by little to a carnivorous diet, it adapts itself by secreting an appropri- ate gastric juice; but this secretion, which needed, for its original production, the action of the external factor represented by the animal food, is afterwards produced spontaneously and in anticipa- tion, from internal causes, when the animal food fails to appear at the usual meal time, and the animal merely perceives the odour of it from afar. As every one knows who has followed my studies of biological synthesis, summed up and stated in final form in my book, The Nature of Life,2 it is this mnemonic property, conceived in the widest sense in the above definition, that has allowed us to include in it, and thus explain as particular cases of a general property, all the finalist manifestations of life, from the one extreme, the development of the embryo, to the other, the highest and most complicated psychical activity of human genius. It is not surprising that this method of wider and wider extension of given psychical concepts, to the point of making them include biological and physiological processes properly so-called, yields fertile results: the ancient, irreconcilable dualism between mind and body has been gradually replaced, in science, by the truer view of the fundamental substantial unity of the two categories of vital! phenomena. It follows that all the most particular and character- istic properties of the mind, of the psyche, can only be intensifications, specific variations, or complex modalities of very general and more simple properties exhibited by life in all its manifestations. It is thus a matter of, rising to the widest possible conception which, while comprehending the psychical facts as particular cases, at the same time includes biological and physiological phenomena in general, which manifest this property in its most general and simplest form. 1 E.

Once particular and complex properties have been thus reduced to more general and simple ones, we also proceed more easily to form 'new hypotheses for their explanation, as was the case with my hypo- thesis of " Specific accumulation ", which may serve to explain the fundamental mnemonic property of living substance. It is this research, striving, by purely intuitive means, to discover the most general and simple form which the most characteristic psychical properties, when reduced to their simplest expression, take on in biol6gical processes in general; it is the investigation of the latter with close attention to discover, in each one of their pulsations, -the feeble and simplified echo of the corresponding more intense and complex psychical activities, finally reducing both to purely energetic manifestations of a new form of energy, with properties peculiar to itself and situated at the basis of life: it is this method of psycho- biological synthesis which leads to a conception of life much more complete and adequate than the mechanist view now dominant, according to which all living beings are nothing but a series of purely physico-chemical processes, without any sense or purpose; a con- ception as cold as death, while life, quivering and palpitating, is its most complete and absolute antithesis.</page></plain_text>
