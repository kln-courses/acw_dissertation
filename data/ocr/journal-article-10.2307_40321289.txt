<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reclaiming the Peircean Cosmology: Existential Abduction and the Growth of the Self1 Michael Ventimiglia Abstract The cosmology of Charles Peirce has tradi- tionally been amongst the least celebrated aspects of his thought. It is typically con- sidered far too anthropomorphic to be a serious contribution to our understanding of the evolution of reality. While this anthropomorphism may or may not dis- qualify the cosmology from serious scien- tific consideration, it is possible that the cosmology does offer philosophical insights about the very human experience that inspired it. In this paper I offer a "reclaim- ing" of the Peircean cosmology. My intent is to look to the Peircean cosmology not for insights about the growth of the cosmos as such, but for insights about the growing self. Specifically, the paper attempts to apply Peirces thoughts about abduction and the growth of cosmic ideas to the growth of the self. Taking cue from Peirce s three-fold distinction between models of evolutionary growth in "Evolutionary Love," I contrast authentic growth of the self with two models of degenerate growth. Keywords: Peirce, Cosmology, Self Evolution, Anthropomorphism, Abduction "Evolutionary Love, " "Existential Abduction" It looks to me as though the investi- gation we are undertaking is no ordi- nary thing, but one for a man who sees sharply. Since we're not clever men ... we should make this kind of investigation of it: if someone had, for example, ordered men who don't see very sharply to read little letters from afar and then someone had the thought that the same letters are somewhere else also, but bigger and in a bigger place, I suppose it would look like a godsend to be able to con- TRANSACTIONS OF THE CHARLES S.

The ^ inference from the one to the other is justified by the reality of the Idea qj of justice, by that which makes justice justice in both the city and the S soul. And so Socrates goes on to construct the perfectly just polis by -3 which he infers, analogously, the structure of the perfectly just soul. £&gt; This strategy yields a compelling account of the harmonious soul and the benefits of virtue. Socrates looks to the macrocosm and learns about h-^ the human. \1 In the Peircean cosmology we have a macrocosm of significantly ^ larger scope. The cosmology was intended by Peirce to be a unified the- r_, ory of all reality - mental and physical, possible, actual and general - rj with implications for every branch of human learning. Indeed, it ^ would, Peirce hoped, be in its book-long formulation "one of the births oo of time." 3 It has, in fact, turned out be perhaps the least celebrated JZ¡ aspect of his thought, famously referred to as the "black sheep or white &lt;J elephant" of Peirce s philosophy by W.B. Gallie in 1966.4 The consid- CÚ ered, though not unanimous, verdict on Peirce's cosmology is that it is f-H far too anthropomorphic a description of reality to be thought of as a serious scientific hypothesis.5 But while Peirce s infusion of final causal- ity, feeling and consciousness into the physical world has alienated many scholars seeking a scientifically satisfactory cosmology per se, these features of Peirce s cosmology can only be an occasion for intrigue for those of us who may be interested in the human as such. The phe- nomenon that is writ large across the growing Peircean cosmos is, after all, human growth. And so, with a strategy similar to that of Socrates, I suggest that we consider looking to the Peircean macrocosm for wis- dom about the microcosm. In this article I offer a "reclaiming" of the anthropomorphic Peircean cosmology. I attempt, in some small fash- ion, to take back what is ours. Specifically, I intend to apply a number of Peirce s suggestions about cosmic growth to our understanding of the growth of the Peircean self. I would like to begin by briefly addressing Peirces anthropomor- phism, justifying our inference from the Peircean cosmology to a model of the growing self (Part I). I will then provide a brief account of the Peircean growing cosmos (Part II). This, in turn, will be used to struc- ture a discussion of the growing self (Part III). Parti: Peirce's Anthropomorphic Cosmology At times Peirce spoke of anthropomorphism as something like a condi- tion of all human thought. Rather than denying the imprint of the human intellect on human inquiry, Peirce insisted that the basic 662</page><page sequence="3">notions of science must be, at bottom, inspired by fundamental ele- &amp; ments of human experience (cf. EP II, 193; 1903). "The very concep- 2- tion of causality," Peirce noted, "has its origin in our tendency to seek g' relations in nature analogous to intellectual relations" (MS 963, c. 3 1893).6 All human artifacts, ideal or actual, bear the stamp of their r* author, and so " '[anthropomorphic' is what pretty much all concep- ° tions are at bottom" (EP II, 152, 1903). Human ideas are inevitably 2. shaped by the human experience. fj While Peirce insisted on this anthropomorphic condition of 3 thought, however, he did not accept the conclusion that this placed a Q veil between the world in itself and the human inquirer. Rather than g supposing that our logic was tragically foreign to the nature of things, 2- Peirce thought we should assume, as a regulative ideal of inquiry, that ^ human ideas and inferences were analogues of real cosmic ideas and ¿, inferences, that our logic and our concepts were derivative of an objec- S. tive cosmic logic. From our own experience of the logic and growth of g ideas, then, we would infer what the macrocosmic growth of generali- ci- ties would analogously be like. This inference from microcosmic logical ^ growth to macrocosmic logical growth is explicitly referenced in Peirce s §[ speculations about the origin of the cosmos: n o' Every attempt to understand anything - every research - supposes or at least hopes y that the very objects of study themselves are subject to g^ a logic more or less identical with that which we employ .... [The * hypothesis] we ought to try is ... the hypothesis that the logic of the n universe is one to which our own aspires, rather than attains. [CP Q 6.189, 1898] | We ought to hypothesize, in other words, that there is a cosmic logic not S^ foreign to our human logic. Although Peirce speculates that our human 3- logic may "aspire" to - and therefore not be perfectly isomorphic with - on this cosmic logic, in practice what Peirce has done is to present a hypoth- t% esis about the nature of the cosmos which involves a generalization and » ontologization of our own human logic as he understood it.7 Peirce g therefore assumes that the cosmos is, in its most general features, "sub- £ ject to a logic" similar to our own, and goes on to create a metaphysics ^ which is a reflection of this logic, a metaphysics which "consists in the r results of the absolute acceptance of logical principles not merely as reg- &lt; datively valid, but as truths of being" (CP 1 .487, c. 1 896). z Far from anthropomorphism being a limit on human inquiry, then, g Peirce makes a virtue of necessity and declares anthropomorphism to be £ a regulative ideal of inquiry. Anthropomorphism actually becomes a ~ recommending factor in hypothesis formation: But as to its being unscientific because anthropomorphic, that is an objection of a very shallow kind .... [I] n regard to any preference for ^3</page><page sequence="4">^ one kind of theory over another, it is well to remember that every sin- &lt;[¡ gle truth of science is due to the affinity of the human soul to the soul ~9 of the universe, imperfect as that affinity no doubt is .... I have after § long years of the severest examination become fully satisfied that, ^ other things being equal, an anthropomorphic conception, whether it xjn makes the best nucleus for a scientific working hypothesis or not, is ^ far more likely to be approximately true than one that is not anthro- | pomorphic. [EP II, 152, 1903] ^O As Christopher Hookway and others have pointed out, Peirce s strategy here places him squarely in the tradition of philosophers who have oo sought to explain how reality must be if we are to explain the possibil- *Z ity of human knowledge. 8 O Our interest, however, is less in whether Peirce was scientifically jus- HH tified in creating an anthropomorphic cosmology than in the fact that É""1 he did create such a cosmology. The Peircean cosmology is indeed ^ anthropomorphic at every turn, here reflecting the patterns of human ^ inquiry, there taking on features such as feeling and final causality that ^ we would typically associate only with animate beings. And yet, even if, ^ despite Peirces protestations, the cosmology were to be considered ^¡ overly anthropomorphic - an excessive rendering unto the cosmos of r characters typically predicated of the human - this is hardly cause for despair for those of us interested in understanding features of the human experience as such. As Thomas Goudge noted some years ago, Peirces evolutionary theory - when applied to processes less compre- hensive than cosmic evolution but more purposeful than organic evo- lution - has an acute explanatory power.9 Given that the cosmology is already the result of an analogy from the microcosm to the macrocosm, an inference back from the macrocosm to the microcosm would simply be a reclaiming of the Peircean cosmology. Part II: The Lope of Cosmic Growth This development of Reason consists, you will observe, in embodi- ment, that is, in manifestation. The creation of the universe, which did not take place during a certain busy week, in the year 4004 B.C., but is going on today and never will be done, is the very development of Reason. [EP II, 255, 1903] The growth of the Peircean cosmos is one with the growth of reason- ableness. It is the unfolding of an argument. Although Peirce under- stood his model of evolution to have something of an analogue in Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's theory of organic evolution, Peirce did not ontologize the principles of this or any other theory of biological evolu- tion. Peirce ontologized the principles of logical evolution, the growth of ,,, ideas, as he understood them. To speak of Peirces evolutionism is to 664 ,,,</page><page sequence="5">speak of the growth of mind, and it is of course modeled upon human *j&amp; logic. The growth of the cosmos is the growth of ideas. Indeed, accord- Cl- ing to Peirce, the "Universe [is] precisely an argument" (EP II, 194, g' 1903), the laws of nature being "ideas or resolutions in the mind of 5' some vast consciousness (CP 5.107, 1903). With all due respect to r* Peirces gestures towards empirical confirmation for his metaphysical a hypotheses, in order to understand Peirces cosmos it is essential to 2. understand that it is, first and foremost, the cosmos of a logician.10 fj In a passage where Peirce makes explicit reference to the analogy § from human to cosmic logic, he writes: Q Looking upon the course of logic as a whole we see that it proceeds £L from the question to the answer - from the vague to the definite. And oq so likewise all the evolution we know of proceeds from the vague to the definite . . . the undifferentiated differentiates itself. The homogo- x nous puts on heterogeneity. However it may be in special cases, then, £ we must suppose that as a rule the continuum has been derived from g a more general continuum, a continuum of higher generality. [CP £L 6.191, 1898] &gt; d- If we follow this logic back to its theoretical limit point, we come to the g state of Absolute Potentiality, that initial state of cosmic growth which g is the most general continuum: "the utter vagueness of completely g undetermined and dimensionless potentiality" (CP6. 193, 1898). Like- °- wise, as we look forward to the infinite future we must suppose a state gf in which all vagueness has been eliminated, all potentiality has been o exhausted, a state of complete instantiation that Peirce refers to as a | crystallized mind (EP I, 297, 1891). These somewhat bizarre features of g- the hyperbolic Peircean cosmology are intelligible only when we recall o^ its anthropomorphic origins in human reasoning.11 As human logic g- proceeds from the vague to the definite, so too, we must assume, does ^ cosmic logic. The cosmic limit points are theoretical, asymptotic exten- fu- sions of "the course of logic" (CP 6.191, 1898), the growth of human # ideas. g. Much like a vague feeling in an author works its way into specific ~ concrete words on a page through general ideas, the Peircean cosmos K evolves from vague feeling to concrete actuality through general ideas [2 or cosmic habits. Indeed, as we will see below, feeling plays an essential &lt;; role in guiding the evolution of the cosmic ideas or habits. The initial z state of Absolute Potentiality is characterized as "a chaos of unpersonal- ~ ized feeling . . ." (EP I, 297, 1891). 12 Elsewhere, Peirce writes, "Feeling | [is] assumed as the starting point; but feeling uncoordinated having its E manifoldness implicit" (CP 6.585, 1905). This initial state, which can be thought of as a boundless pool of sentient quality - utterly undeter- mined but of magnificent intensity - is the theoretical beginning point from which all growth proceeds.13 It is utterly vague, immeasurably 665</page><page sequence="6">^ rich, and full of incomprehensible potential. Through the course of &lt;l! evolution this vague felt potentiality is made actual. At the opposite g limit point, then, we asymptotically approach a state in which all feel- 3 ing has been extinguished, all felt potentiality has been made actual, the Z heat death of Absolute Actuality. ^ Between these Absolute Limit points of Potentiality (Firstness) and &lt;u Actuality (Secondness) general ideas or cosmic habits function as 6 Thirds, mediating between potentiality and actuality. Cosmic generali- -g ties - ideas or habits - translate the vague, felt cosmic potential into the í&gt; actual through cosmic law. Ideas or habits are for Peirce general laws ^ which influence evolution by bringing about certain general types of ^ results, (cf. CP 1.342). As the cosmos evolves these habits become p. greater in number and they shade from general cosmic tendencies M which allow for chance aberrations into nearly perfect and determinate f-H laws, their mode of causation shading from final cause into efficient QJ cause as we will see below. Peter Turley puts this in a way which is for- &lt;J túnate for our project: ^ The evolution of the laws of nature, Peirce contends, has its point of &lt;^ departure in an utterly lawless state, but it will culminate in a state q£ characterized by the complete triumph of law. The world is thus like £_, the human individual who grows from a state in which he is but a tabula rasa (as far as acquired habits are concerned) to a state of in which the power of habit is all inclusive and irresistible.14 But this brings us to the essence of Peircean growth - the process by which cosmic potentiality is actualized - habit-taking. Habit-taking is the fundamental characteristic of the evolving Peircean cosmos and it is one with the growth of ideas. Much like Peirce equated beliefs with habits of action in his early writings, cosmic laws become habits of action in his cosmology. At the heart of habit-taking, or the growth of ideas, is the abductive inference. While the logic of cosmic growth properly involves all three logical inferences - abduction, deduction and induction - our primary interest is in the abductive inference. The abductive inference, most commonly and easily understood as a hypothetic inference from a number of surprising facts to an explana- tion of those facts, is the essence of the growth of Peircean ideas at all cosmic levels, from scientific hypotheses to personal growth to the evo- lution of cosmic law. A discussion of abduction in the context of inquiry will help clarify abduction at the cosmic level. It is first necessary to point out that Peirce s theory of abduction, perhaps the most important and original part of his understanding of logical growth, underwent a transformation during the final decade of the nineteenth century, precisely the years in which Peirce gave the most serious attention to his cosmology.15 K.T. Fann describes these 666</page><page sequence="7">years as a "transitional period" between Peirce's early and later view of ff abduction.16 It is not until the 1901 text "The Logic of Drawing His- g- tory from Ancient Documents" that Peirce seems to clearly state his §' more mature view of abduction.17 As Peirce himself notes, "in almost 5' everything I printed before the beginning of the century I more or less * mixed up Hypothesis and Induction (CP 8.227, c.1910). Although a n full treatment of this topic is beyond the scope of this paper, a case can 2. be made that elements of both Peirce s early and later understanding of fj abduction find their way into Peirce's evolutionary cosmology. Also, I s think it is important for our purposes to point out that the early and Q later theories share important continuities. g Peirce s early view of abduction is best illustrated by his well-known 2- contrast of the deductive and abductive syllogisms: ^ Rule - All the beans from this bag are white b. Case - These beans are from this bag n&gt; [Therefore] Result - These beans are white 2 Then its corresponding abduction would be: Er Rule - All the beans from this bag are white E . Result - These beans are white 3 [Therefore] Case -These beans are from this bag [EP 188, 1878] g P- His later view is perhaps best illustrated by the 1903 passage: fif O The surprising fact, C, is observed; o But if A were true, C would be a matter of course. g^ Hence there is reason to suspect that A is true. [EP II, 231, 1903] o r-t- The important differences, as Douglas Anderson notes, are that in the a early view Peirce "as yet makes no distinction between the evidencing £L nature of the abduction and its function as a source of the hypothesis itself. Moreover, we must notice the narrowness of the syllogistic con- _ text; for while Peirce's later view of abduction will encompass such ? hypotheses as finding cases from rules and results, it must also account x for abductions which present entirely new classes of things into scien- w tifie theory."18 Without minimizing these differences it is important to ^ acknowledge the continuity between these two understandings of EjJ abduction. Anderson implicitly acknowledges this continuity by sug- 3 gesting that the later theory encompasses an important element of the § earlier one. Anderson then also points out that while abduction and r induction both share the function of providing evidence for hypotheses &gt; in Peirce s early writing "even at [the] early stage Peirce acknowledged the other aspect of abduction: its function as a source of new hypothe- ses. Therefore, the shift is not simply from evidencing process to source ^7</page><page sequence="8">^ of new ideas, but a shift from a conflation of these two ideas to a par- tì ticular emphasis on the latter."19 Perhaps it is fair to say that while g induction and abduction may have been conflated in Peirce's earlier 3 work, the claim that abductions create a new general relationship by Z putting prior ideas into a new relationship is consistent with both his 3J early and later view. Abduction is the creation of new generality. &lt;u This fundamental aspect of Peircean abduction appears in Peirce s £ ontologization of the abductive inference. Referring to the very begin- - ning of the cosmos, Peirce writes: &gt; Thus the zero of bare possibility, by evolutionary logic, leapt into the ^ unit of some quality. This was hypothetic inference. Its form was: U Something is possible, í~^ Red is something; ^ Therefore, Red is possible. [CP 6.220, 1898] ^ The initial qualities abduced in the earliest stages of cosmic develop- H-r ment were the Platonic Ideas from which any possible universe could ^ have evolved (CP 6.192, 1898). The first abductions created the first ^ possibilities, and subsequent evolution was dependent upon further r cosmic abduction, deduction and induction. Peirces well-known blackboard example illustrates further cosmic abduction well: Once the line will stay a little while after it is marked, another line may be drawn beside it. Very soon our eye persuades us there is a new line, the envelope of those others. This rather prettily illustrates the logical process which we may suppose takes place in things, in which the generalizing tendency builds up new habits from chance occur- rences. [CP 6.206, 1898] These two illustrations of cosmic abduction seem to reflect various elements of Peirces early and later theories of abduction. The hypo- thetical syllogism from the first passage above seems consistent with Peirce s early sense that abduction is limited to the terms established in the first two lines of a syllogism. Both passages about the very begin- ning of the cosmos, however, remind us that there is a logical priority to abduction, a sentiment that is most prominent in Peirces later the- ory in which the three inferences of abduction, deduction and induc- tion become three stages of inquiry. In any case, what seems consistent with both theories is that abduction establishes a new possible general- ity, a new generality which may or may not persist and evolve into a general tendency. Abduction is thus the creation of a new possible idea, the inauguration of habit- taking. It is worth mentioning, I think, that this role of abduction is espe- cially clear in Peirce's examples of physiological habit-taking: 668</page><page sequence="9">If a person who has never tried such a thing before undertakes to £3 stand on one foot and to move the other round a horizontal circle ... CL and at the same time to move the fist of the same side as the moving g" foot round a horizontal circle in the opposite direction ... he will, at g- first, find he cannot do it. The difficulty is that he lacks a unitary con- ^ cept of the series of efforts that success requires. By practicing the dif- ¿f ferent parts of the movement, while attentively observing the kind of »-d effort requisite in each part, he will, in a few minutes, catch the idea, 5' and will then be able to perform the movements with perfect facility. g [CP 5.479] » n o Elsewhere Peirce gives a similar example and notes that: "a general con- 3 ception of the action springs up and it becomes perfectly easy" (EP I, §- 328, 1892). The general idea "unites" less general habits into a new ^ habit. As Peirce notes, "The same mental process is many times tn employed whenever we are learning to speak a language or are acquir- sl- ing any sort of skill" {EP I, 329, 1892). Remembering that what we g consider actual or existent always retains an element of generality, gr abduction at any level in the Peircean cosmos can be understood as the &gt; creation of a new possible generality which connects prior generali- pl ties.20 n Recalling that the Peircean cosmos is evolving from vague, felt g potentiality to actuality, we are now in position to understand what is p truly distinctive (and, indeed, controversial) about Peirce s understand- g- ing of abduction.21 The uniqueness of the Peircean abductive inference 5* is captured in the paradoxical confluence of freedom and constraint at CD its spontaneous beginnings. On the one hand, abduction is not deter- 3 mined by prior force. As a logical inference this is seen in the difference g- between abduction and deduction. Unlike the deductive inference the o abductive inference is not necessary. There is an element of chance g- involved in its creation. In "The Doctrine of Necessity Examined" and n "Reply to the Necessitarians," Peirce stressed the importance of free- 2- dom on the cosmic scale, outlining what he thought were the logical and empirical difficulties involved with denying the role of spontaneity ^ in growth. Where there is growth and complexity "we may fairly infer ~ . . . that there is probably in nature some agency by which the com- X plexity and diversity of things can be increased; and that consequently w the rule of mechanical necessity meets in some way with interference" &lt;; (EP I, 308, 1 892). Elsewhere he notes that growth is diversification and § "wherever diversity is increasing, there chance must be operative" (EP I, ~ 349, 1892). Just as logical abduction is not reducible to antecedent ~ ideas, cosmic abduction depends upon cosmic spontaneity, moments £ of freedom from the sway of prior habits or ideas. &gt; On the other hand, however, newly abduced ideas are influenced by their teleological context. In the Peircean cosmos, prior general ideas influence abduction and growth through the power of final cause. ggo</page><page sequence="10">^ Peircean spontaneity is constrained by teleology. Otherwise put, the &lt;u absolute chance at work in Peircean habit-taking is not, as we might p expect of "absolute chance," independent. Unlike the flip of a coin or d the roll of the roulette wheel, the results of prior acts of chance - i.e. the Z habits which have grown from them - will affect consequent acts of ^ chance. Specifically, cosmic ideas, in their capacity as final causes, will &lt;u affect spontaneity and will therefore compromise its independence. S When we remind ourselves of the deeply anthropocentric character of -^ the Peircean cosmos, we can see how Peirce's understanding of the role í&gt; of il lume natural (the guessing instinct) in human logic is amplified in ^ his cosmology. Abduction at the level of human logic depends upon the ^ felt ideological guidance provided by its context. Recall that there is a ^ sensual aspect to human abduction, as Peirce noted even early in his ^ career (EP I, 199, 1878), and the searching for the proper abduction £-h depends to some extent on a felt sense of appropriateness. We see this QJ at work in the guidance of il lume natural in science or in sentiment in &lt;J practical matters. At the cosmic level, this implies that new cosmic pos- oo sibilities will be guided, though not determined, by their ideological JZj context. At their most pervasive and gentle, cosmic habits exert their &lt;3 influence primarily through the lure of final causation. In their more P^ habit-ridden manifestations these general ideas shade into matter itself, H so habit-ridden that their mode of causality approaches, but does not reach, the limit point of efficient causality. Recalling once again that "[t]he existence of things consists in their regular behavior" {EP I, 278, c.1890), we see that even the least mind-like levels of the Peircean cos- mos can be understood to be ideas or habits of action infused with feel- ing and operating though some level of final causality. Even in matter, the limit point of actuality, cosmic feeling is not perfectly extinguished (cf. EP\, 349, 1892). Thus general ideas, for Peirce, remain living feel- ings or, as Robert Corrington puts it, "concresced moments within the life of feeling."22 Again, if we take our human experience of the growth of ideas as a model, Peirce's explanation of the growth of cosmic ideas becomes understandable. Much as vague feelings guide the inquirer towards ideas which may capture those feelings, cosmic ideas guide cos- mic behavior and the creation of new cosmic habits through their felt influence on cosmic creation. As the cosmos evolves potentialities become realized through cosmic generalities - habits or ideas - and the creation of Peircean evolution is affected, though not determined, by the power of final cause. Peirce's threefold distinction between models of growth in "Evolu- tionary Love" is useful for providing both a final opportunity for clari- fication of Peircean evolution and a rubric for our discussion of personal growth in Part III. In "Evolutionary Love" Peirce presents his model of cosmic growth, which he there refers to as agapasm, as an ( alternative to two competing models, tychasm and anancasm.</page><page sequence="11">Tychastic evolution is a model of growth Peirce created to accom- ^ modate what he thought was the general logic of Darwin's evolutionary £- theory:23 g" 5' Natural selection, as conceived by Darwin, is a mode of evolution in rt which the only positive element of change in the whole passage from n&gt; moner to man is fortuitous variation. To secure advance in a definite Jj* direction chance has to be seconded by some action that shall hinder £ the propagation of some varieties or stimulate that of others. In natu- p ral selection, strictly so called, it is the crowding out of the weak. In ^ sexual selection, it is the attraction of beauty, mainly. [EP I, 358, o 1893] 3 cT Tychasm represents a generalized version of Darwinian evolution. The ^ reason that Peirce equates Darwinian evolution with tychasm lies in the w nature of Darwinian variation, or what we would now refer to as ran- g* dom mutation: It is completely unaffected by ideological influence, by 3 the purposes of the organism. What is essential to tychastic evolution ^ generally is that new possibilities are not affected by any teleological &gt; influence. So in Darwinian evolution any tendency towards fitness over a- time will have to be the result of chance plus some selection. In tychas- 2 tic evolution generally, directionality of any sort will be the result some g second orienting factor that lends the directionality to the process. g A second model of growth Peirce addressed was anancasm. Anan- &amp;- casm is evolution in which spontaneity has been extinguished. It is evo- ¿f lution without the "living freedom" of spontaneity (cf. EP I, 363, O 1893). It is evolution by force. Under the heading of anancasm fall a 9 number of theories of evolution - biological, philosophical and cosmo- g- logical - which understand the evolutionary process to be the result of o^ either an inner or outer necessity. Peirce specifically mentions cata- g- strophism as an example of external anancasm and he implies that ^ orthogenesis would be an example of internal anancasm. g- Both tychasm and anancasm turn out to be doctrines which are not # satisfactorily teleological for Peirce. In tychasm the teleology is too ^ weak. In anancastic evolution the telos, if it exists at all, is so fixed that ~ it seems indistinguishable from the inevitable product of brute force. It E is a teleology that does not evolve. Agapasm, which captures the con- w fluence of constraint and freedom at the heart of the abductive infer- &lt;; enee, is Peirce's preferred model of cosmic evolution, a developmental z teleology. We are now in the position to offer a reclaiming of the ~ anthropomorphic Peircean cosmology. ~ Part III: The Growth of the Self &gt; Keeping in mind that the self is, according to Peirce, an idea,24 a gener- ality that is in essentials of the same nature as the cosmos which inhab- its it, we can apply Peirce's insights about the cosmos back to the self, (¿]\</page><page sequence="12">^ back to the source of the inspiration for the anthropomorphic cosmos. &lt;u Thus we can speak of the self as an idea that possesses its own poten- g tiality. We can speak of the development of the self as the incomplete 3 and undetermined realization of this potentiality. We can speak of the Z self as vagueness made determinate over time. Finally, we can speak of ^ the inference which is at the heart of Peircean growth, abduction, and &lt;u how it is affected by the felt influence of final cause in personal growth. S Whereas the cosmos springs from pure nothingness, the self finds - itself immersed in cosmic ideas and potentialities. Thus growth for the £&gt; self will involve not only the realization of whatever potential the idea ^ of the self may possess. Growth for the self will also involve existential ^ "leaps" in potential that are the product of surrendering to wider cos- ^ mie ends. This most fundamental movement of the self towards more _ general cosmic ends might be thought of as "existential abduction."25 f-H This term can be used to refer to the growth of the self's ends towards QJ the asymptotic limit point of the full instantiation of cosmic ends. Thus &lt;J when we speak of the potential of the self, we are speaking not merely c/D to what is possible for the persons we are, but also to what it is possible Z for us to become. &lt;í In this section I will offer three models of personal growth derived P^ from the three models of cosmic growth outlined above. Two of these H models, tychasm and anancasm, are what Peirce referred to as "degen- erate" modes of growth. Of course just as Peirce thought that "[i]n the very nature of things, the line of demarcation between the three modes of evolution is not perfectly sharp," (UP I, 363, 1893) it is also likely the case that personal growth cannot be neatly packaged into three models. Still, I think, we can make intelligible distinctions between models of growth in which one or another element is, in Peirce s words, "of prin- cipal importance" (UP I, 362, 1893). Also, following Peirce, it is impor- tant to note that the degenerate models of growth are likely at work in smaller, less general, processes of growth within the larger self (cf. EPl, 363-371, 1893). Tychastic Evolution of the Self: Disowning One's Self To allow ourselves to experience our potentiality is to allow ourselves to feel both the potential of the person we are and the cosmic lure of per- sons we may be. But the mere acknowledgement of such possibility is often painful. With the admission of potentiality comes the pain and anxiety associated with the possibility of failing to truly realize this potential. An awareness of one's potential, in other words, comes with a commensurate responsibility to one's potential. And so the self may simply refuse to feel its potential. The motive for such a disowning of the self is a freedom from responsibility to oneself. Psychologist N. Branden, in his reported dialogue with a patient, describes this phe- ^_- nomenon as follows: 672 ^_-</page><page sequence="13">If you never really commit yourself to struggling for a career and a 5*3 real life for yourself, you'll never have to find out just what your CL potentiality is. ... So, to protect your self-esteem, to avoid finding g* out what you can or cannot accomplish, you do nothing, you just g* drift - and then loathe yourself for your passivity.26 ^ n&gt; The result of such an evasion of ones potentiality is the tychastic evolu- $ tion of the self. Tychastic evolution occurs when the self has no sense of ^ purpose grounded in felt potentiality. The result, as Branden puts it, is g a disowning of the self: "When a person represses certain of his desires, ^ because he cannot tolerate the anxiety of wondering whether or not he 2 will attain them, an anxiety that makes him feel helpless and ineffec- © tual, he disowns a part of himself . . . ,"27 &lt;g In genuine Peircean growth the self's unactualized potential, along ^ with the lure of cosmic ends, guides the evolution of the self. In tychas- £? tic growth new ends are not selected with the benefit of this teleologi- £ cal guidance. The result is the adoption of random ends, ends with no 2 special relation to the self's potential or cosmic ends. This is the philo- £- sophical basis of the "drifting" that Branden describes above. Tychastic ^ evolution in the person is growth without purpose. And so this type of &amp;* growth is characterized by negative freedom, by a sense of being com- g. pletely unconstrained. This freedom is bought at the price of a disown- 3 ing ones potential. It is a denial of the gentle constraint of personal and S cosmic potentiality. r* We have seen that in cosmic tychastic evolution, any "growth" is the n product of chance combined with some second orienting factor. As in £? Darwinian evolution, the possible habits that arise in tychastic evolu- ^ tion are random. For tychastic growth to take on directionality, some 5=r second element, some external pressure, is therefore necessary. Likewise -»-&gt; in the tychastic evolution of the self, directionality, if it occurs, must be jr the result of some second orienting factor. The self will grow only to the &lt;g extent that failed ends are weeded out or abandoned, resulting in a ^ growth - by default - of the whole self. Since the tychastic self does * not allow itself to feel or acknowledge its potentiality, the adoption of ^ new ends is random and the appearance of directionality will need to be ñ the result of some second orienting factor, something analogous to nat- &gt; ural selection in the Darwinian model. f What then is the algorithm for such an orienting factor? Tychastic £? evolution suggests that ends are weeded out only when they fail to serve ^ an essential purpose, such as survival at the organic level. One sugges- g tion for how this might operate at the level of human growth is that o ends are weeded out when they bring the self to a certain threshold of &gt; psychological or physical pain, a point at which the ends threaten the psychological or physical well-being of the self. There is a point at which the pain of not altering ones ends may outweigh the pain of 673</page><page sequence="14">^ abandoning them. At this point, the self may choose to replace present &lt;u habits with less painful ends. "Growth" would then occur when ends g are so painful that the self abandons them. The self is so far improved 3 when the painful ends are destroyed. Thus the fear or experience of Z pain can cause us to abandon ends and can then be an orienting factor 3¡ in this type of human evolution. It is, ironically, therefore possible to &lt;u grow, in this truncated sense, because of fear rather than in spite of fear. £ There is of course no formula for how we each weigh the advantages - and disadvantages of our habits. The only suggested formula here is í&gt; that habits are adopted randomly and are not replaced until they ^ become more painful than their abandonment. y^ Tychastic evolution, despite the fact that it seeks to avoid the pain ^ and anxiety of genuine growth, turns out to be a very painful and inef- HH ficient method of growth. Our potentialities lie dormant as we drift £-h from one end to the next, developing some possibility only so long as it (J does not cause us discomfort. Since there is little reason to the ends that &lt;J we choose, there is little chance that our actual potential will ever be oo developed. If there is hope for the tychastic self, it may lie in the fact Z that the pain of tychastic evolution itself, the pain of purposelessness, &lt;3 may be enough to persuade the self to abandon it. We learn, perhaps, P¿ that the pain of purposelessness is too great, and we abandon the very H habit of tychastic evolution. Anancastic Evolution of the Self: The Escape from Freedom In the pop-psychology phenomenon The Road Less Traveled M. Scott Peck writes: In attempting to avoid the pain of responsibility, millions and even billions daily attempt to escape from freedom . . . Dr. Hilde Bruch, in the preface to her book Learning Psychotherapy, states that basically all patients come to psychiatrists with "one common problem: the sense of helplessness, the fear and inner conviction of being unable to 'cope' and to change things." One of the roots of this "sense of impotence" in the majority of patients is some desire to partially or totally escape the pain of freedom, and therefore, some failure, partial or total, to escape responsibility for the problems of their lives.28 Anancastic evolution is the self's flight from freedom. Whereas in tychastic evolution the self evades its felt potentiality by granting itself a complete freedom to adopt random ends, in anancastic evolution the self evades its felt potentiality by attaching itself to one particular end, thereby eliminating the possibility of the emergence of new ends. Anancastic evolution makes genuine growth impossible by extinguish- ing the condition of growth - freedom. This escape from freedom is once again an escape from responsibil- 674 ity to the self's potentiality. By choosing not to choose we avoid the</page><page sequence="15">pain of responsibility involved in deliberate growth. The degenerate ^ "growth" that occurs here is merely the product of the continued pur- Je- suit of some one end. The end that is developed is itself, however, fixed. g" The self does not risk abandoning this end and so no growth beyond it 3' is possible. Interestingly, because anancasm may involve an extraordi- rt nary amount of development in the name of a fixed end, it may seem n like genuine growth to both the self and others. The self appears to be 2. developing because habits are indeed being refined as means to a pre- £ determined end. But this growth is relative only to the predetermined cj end, an end which may or may not be part of the self's felt potentiality. Q This appearance of maturity will therefore cover over the fact that it is g not the self in its genuine potentiality that is growing. 2- Following Peirce we might distinguish between two forms of anan- era castic growth of the self: In its external variety, anancastic growth will "^ be the result of an external force imposing an end on the self. External £. anancasm would seem to occur when the self either finds itself in or g willingly submits itself to an overly disciplined, authoritarian environ- g- ment. In its internal variety, evolution will be the result of an "inward ^ necessity principle." Internal anancasm of the self may occur when the g] self is subject to some internal fixed end. Perhaps a common result of o external anancasm in childhood is the phenomenon of internal anan- 5' casm in adulthood as specific ends demanded by external sources p become internalized. Peirce himself suggested that the growth of most jL human beings followed this model: "If the evolution of history is in 3- considerable part of the nature of internal anancasm, it resembles the ^ development of individual men" CEP I, 368, 1893). o Perhaps, extrapolating from Peirce, we might speculate that the % anancastic self's greatest hope might be "cataclysmic evolution." Under o the heading of external anancasm, recall, falls cataclysmic evolution (EP ^P I, 360, 1 893). Cataclysmic evolution is growth that results from sudden n&gt; changes in the external environment (CP 1.104, 1896). Just as scien- d. tifie evolution may take a great leap because of new observational tools "^ (CP 1.109, 1896) or new evidence, it seems that personal evolution might occur for similar reasons. It is common for habits to be broken S up as the result of severe environmental changes: the death of a loved £ one, a near death experience, a national catastrophe. It may be possible w that a significant external shock can forcefully disrupt the self's ends. ^ w Agapastic Evolution of the Self: Existential Abduction 3 In tychastic growth the self evolves only when the pain of failed habits § outweighs the pain of growth. In the anancastic growth, the self sub- r mits to the pursuit of some one fixed end in the avoidance of genuine &gt; growth. The agapastic growth of the self is the one model of evolution in which the self undertakes the challenges associated with growth as it attempts to actualize its potentiality. Genuine growth will require the , -</page><page sequence="16">^ spontaneous appearance and development of new possible ends which v are harmonious with the self's potentiality and the lure of cosmic ends. g Our potential begins to be realized in moments of existential abduc- 3 tion. While Peircean growth requires a freedom from the potential Z tyranny of habit, the existential abduction of new ends is not unrelated 3^ to or discontinuous with the self's potential. Likewise, the spontaneous &lt;u appearance of new ends is not determined by force, but it is still in sym- 6 pathy with wider final causes. - Existential abduction is influenced by final causality through feeling. £&gt; In inquiry abduction is the inference based most on the felt guidance of ^ instinct. The Peircean model of personal evolution suggests that senti- ^ ment plays an essential role in the evolution of the self. In existential ^ abduction the self feels new possible habits of action that are in sympa- _ thy with wider ends.29 It is the "interior dimension" of ideas, by which £-h ideas can be felt even when they cannot be articulated, which explains {J how the growth of the self can be ideologically influenced by feeling. In &lt;^ existential abduction we feel new possibilities as more or less appropriate c/3 to our own developments. Practically what this means is that sentiment JZ| should be a useful, though not infallible, guide in the growth of the ends &lt;3 of the self. This does not necessarily mean the self must actualize every QÚ felt end that arises. Possible ends can be deemed likely failures before H they are actualized. This does, however, seem to suggest that the self, if it is to grow, must at least experience and emotionally acknowledge ends that do arise. This is consistent with the claim of Nathaniel Branden, that "every emotion need not be acted on .... What the organism does require for its well being, however - especially in the case of emotions that are more than superficial and momentary - is that they be experi- enced and acknowledged."30 Branden goes so far as to suggest that the frustration of the experience of emotion actually causes much of the destructive behavior humans engage in: "Few of the irrationalities peo- ple commit - the destructive behavior they unleash against themselves and against others - would be possible to them if they did not first cut themselves off from their own deepest feelings."31 For a clarification of the role of the growth of ends in the growth of the self we need look no further than Peirce s own discussion of per- sonal growth in his theory of self-control.32 Insightfully, Peirce notes that it is primarily in the choice of our ideals that we exercise control over our conduct. Our actions, our concrete dealings with the world, will follow more or less according to our general account of ideal con- duct. In choosing general ends we are influencing the character of the more specific ends and concrete actions in our future. Our choice of ends is understood by Peirce to be "the only freedom of which man has any reason to be proud" (EPl, 72fn., 1869). Peirce s mature understanding of self-control addresses the process ,_ , by which the self comes to the capacity to deliberate about possible</page><page sequence="17">habits of action, resolving, ideally, to adopt more and more general cos- mic ends. As Vincent Colapietro notes, authentic selfhood is something to be achieved through the continual surrender of the egos ends to wider ends: "Peirce maintained that the realization of the self demanded a series of acts by which the self surrenders itself to ever more inclusive ideals."33 These acts are what I have called existential abduc- tions. The process of genuine evolution is the process of coming to embody more general ends. As Colapietro notes, "self-transcendence alone leads to self-possession."34 It is through the transcendence of the desire to satisfy only the ego that selfhood is achieved. Through the process of self-control the self comes to desire to itself play a part in the work of creation. The self grows into a love for "what is good for all on the whole" {EP 1, 72fn., 1869). The self's ends ideally become so general that they are one with her community and, finally, for Peirce, one with cosmic mind itself. Conclusion W.B. Gallies verdict on the cosmology of Charles Peirce some forty years ago colorfully captures an embarrassment many Peirce scholars share for this portion of Peirce's work. I am not in position to comment on the actual scientific merit of the Peircean cosmology, but I do believe that the anthropomorphic nature of the Peircean cosmology can, from one intellectual perspective, be considered a virtue. It is my hope that this "reclaiming of the Peircean cosmology" - this Socratic appeal to the macrocosm for wisdom about the microcosm - has been both just and profitable.

This said, what might distinguish Peirce from other philosophers in this tradition is that this regulative hope of inquiry is not, in Hookway s words, a "blind hope" (p. 116). For Peirce this hope is justified both by the successes of past inquiry and by corroborating scientific and philosophical conclusions. An example is Peirces conviction that the history of progress in scientific inquiry could not be explained without supposing that humans had a natural faculty for formulating nearly cor- rect hypotheses. 9. Thomas Goudge, "Peirce's Evolutionism - After Haifa Century" in Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce. Edward C. Moore and Richard S. Robin, eds. (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1964). Goudge offers the example of social evolution: "Final causation overshadows efficient causation at the state of societal evolution. This gives the process a "Lamarckian" character, as Peirce contended. A continuity of minds thus becomes possible. In short, human societal evolution has taken a form quite different from that of biological evolution." Helmut Pape also explores agapasm in social evolution in "Love's Power and the Causality of Mind: C.S. Peirce on the Place of Mind and Culture in Evolution." Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society (1997) 32: 59-90. 10. As Turley notes it appears that Peirce never engages in a serious attempt to pragmatically clarify and empirically confirm his cosmological hypotheses. While the favor Lamarck's theory of evolution enjoyed at the end of century helped pro- vide a viable theory of empirical evolution that was at least potentially consistent with Peirce's general theory of growth, it does not seem to be the case that the "remarkable predictions" (CP 7.517) Peirce promised were ever empirically con- firmed. See Turley, Ibid. p. 88. This is not to suggest that Peirce minimized the importance of empirical confirmation in general, but only to stress that Peirce's evolutionism is primarily the product of his logic, not a metaphysical amplifica- tion of a theory of organic evolution.

Of course abduced ideas may or may not persist. In other words, they are merely possible generalities which may or may not survive deduction and induc- tion (in both human logic and the cosmos). Peirce sees a role for both cosmic deduction and induction in his cosmology. Peirce speaks directly to the deductive element in cosmic law: "We usually conceive nature to be perpetually making deductions in Barbara. This is our natural and anthropomorphic metaphysics. We conceive that there are Laws of Nature, which are her rules or major premises. We conceive that cases arise under these laws; these cases consist in the predication, or occurrence, of causes, which are the middle terms of the syllogisms. And finally we conceive that the occurrence of these causes, by virtue of the laws of Nature, results in effects which are the conclusions of the syllogisms" (CP 2.712). Or, more succinctly: "By deduction, the habit fulfills its function of calling out certain reactions on certain occasions" (CP 6.146). He is less clear about cosmic induc- tion. I address this more thoroughly in Evolutionary Love in Theory and Practice, Ph.D. Dissertation, Pennsylvania State University, 2000. 21.
