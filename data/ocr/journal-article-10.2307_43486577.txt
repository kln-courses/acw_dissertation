Map by Pierre Pichard. Fig. 2 View from Phanigiri hill. I. Phanigiri: the site The last decades of archaeological dis- coveries have significantly transformed the map of Buddhist sites of ancient India. Important new stupa complexes have been excavated throughout the country1. Existing literature has yet to catch up with the new data, which, when it has been published at all, is scattered in archaeological reports and in special- ized articles. Our trusty reference works, such as Lamotte's Histoire du bouddhisme indien , first published in 1958, or Débala Mitra's Buddhist Monuments , published in 1971, are now very much out of date2. This article introduces the stupa complex of Phanigiri in Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh, a centre of Buddhist activity from the third century BCE to at least the third century CE, boasts a large number of archaeological sites, along the coast and along the valleys and deltas of the great Krishna and Godavari riv- ers, which flow eastward into the Bay of Bengal (fig. I)3. Phanigiri has been exca- vated in recent years by the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Andhra Pradesh, but a compre- hensive report is yet to be published4. 1. A stupa or caitya is a solid structure built to enshrine a casket or chamber containing the ashes and bones of a Buddha or, in some cases, of his dis- ciples or other revered figures. A stupa does not usually stand alone; it is part of a complex that can include shrine-halls, image-halls, congregation- halls, refectories, and residences. 2. One important stupa site is Kanaganahalli in Karnataka, for which a report has not yet been published. See Das 2004, Dehejia 2007, and Indian Archœology 1994-95 - A Review. 37-39, Indian Archaeology 1996-97 - A Review. 53-55, and Indian Archœology 1998-99 - A Review. 66. 3. See Mitra 1971, Chapter 10. 4. The most recent document consulted for this paper is the useful "Excavation Report on Buddhist Site at Phanigiri in Tirumalagiri (M) of Nalgonda Dist., A.P. for the year 2001-2002" and ditto "for the year 2002-3003", http://museums.ap.nic.in/ Phanigiri.htmal.

The art of Phanigiri reveals a new and vigorous plastic idiom within the Andhra style. It is closest to the later phases of sites like Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda, and Goli, although the intricacies of the stylistic relations remain to be worked out. What is clear is that Phanigiri is an impor- tant discovery that enriches our under- standing of Andhra art in the Sātavāhana and Iksvāku if not other periods. The stupa complex is located on a low hill, about 200 feet high, adjacent to Phanigiri vil- lage. It lies to the east of the Musi River, which flows south from the highlands of central Andhra Pradesh to join the Krishna River5. During the colonial period many impor- tant Buddhist sites were identified along the Krishna River, including Amaravati (ancient Dhanyakataka), Nagarjunakonda, Jaggayyapeta, Bhattiprolu, and Ghantasala, but as far as I know the inland site of Phanigiri was not noted. Phanigiri's inter- actions with the surrounding landscape, with settlements and centres of power, with long-distance trade routes, and with downstream and deltaic sites remain to be determined. One may assume that the river valley would have been a natural route since pre-historic times. At the foot of the hillock on the north-eastern side is a cluster of megalithic burials6. The Phanigiri site is a large monastic complex which stretches across the flat top of "Serpent Hill" (to follow the popular ety- mology, phanin + giri). From the top there is a commanding view of the surround- ing countryside with its low conical hills (fig. 2). Subrahmanyam (2005: 11) reports "a cluster of Buddhist sites in the vicinity namely, Gazulabanda, Vardhamanukota, Thirumalagiri and Aravapallť'. The latter is a hillock with a "huge brick-built stupa with an ayaka platform", contemporary with the Phanigiri site (Subrahmanyam and Reddy 2004: 367). The Phanigiri com- plex consists - at least - of a large stupa and two apsidal halls. The great stupa (fig. 3), has a diameter of about 18 m, with four projecting ayaka platforms at the cardinal points, each measuring 4 x 1.25 m. Broken stumps of five limestone pillars on the western platform indi- cate that, like other Andhra stupas, the platform originally had ayaka pillars. The two apsidal halls stand side by side. Apsidal hall 1 contains the foundations of a brick caitya. Apsidal hall 2 contains the remains of a caitya encased by limestone slabs, with pilasters carved with lotus medallions and addorsed animals in low relief (fig. 4)7. The apsidal halls stand along one side of what might be called a sacred com- plex, one component of which is a brick platform with two gigantic pairs of foot- prints of the Buddha, carved with auspi- cious signs8. A large area of the hill was apparently reserved for monastic build- ings. Three vihāra (monastic residences) were exposed, each with nine cells9. An octagonal pillar inscription was recovered in a near perfect state of pres- ervation (fig. 5). The inscription records, in large and ornate letters, donations made in year 16 of the reign of King Rudrapurusadatta of the Iksvāku dynasty. The first eight and a half lines are in Sanskrit, the last two and a half in Prakrit. At the time of my visit several inscribed fragments remained on the hilltop where they had just been excavated. One of them bore the formula "homage to the Blessed cultural materials datable to the first century A.D." (Subrahmanyam 2005: 11-15). One of the earliest notices of the current excavations was published in Indian Archaeology 2000-01 - A Review. The research presented here - necessarily preliminary - is based on a single visit to Phanigiri on 3 March, 2005. At that time the major pieces shown here were kept in Phanigiri village at the field headquarters of the State Archaeology team; other recently excavated artefacts, including inscribed fragments, were collected on the hill-top. Some artefacts had already been moved to the State Museum in Hyderabad. According to The Hindu "online edition of India's National Newspaper", March 30, 2007, a museum will be built at the site. 5. The name is spelt in various ways, including Pangiri and Panagiri. The village, which appears only on detailed road maps, is 35 km from Surayapet on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada National Highway. It is 4 kms from Tirumalagiri, a mandai headquar- ters in Nalgonda district. There are plans to develop the site for tourism. 6. Indian Archaeology 2000-01- A Review. 1.

One" ( riamo bhagavato ) in lettering almost identical to that of an inscription of Vijaya- Šātakarņi from Nagarjunakonda10. Other fragmentary inscriptions found in earlier excavations date from the first to third centuries CE. One mentions the founder of the Iksvāku dynasty Siri Cāmtamūla11. Lead and copper coins of the Sātavāhana, Mahātalavāra, and Iksvāku dynasties, along with pots and other artefacts, found at the site suggest a date from the first century BCE to the third century CE (Subrahmanyam and Reddy 2004: 367)12. Given its size, the site must have been developed over a long period. At the time of my visit, I did not see any images later than the Iksvāku period; this suggests that the site may have been abandoned at any early date13. II. Iconography: buddhapāda and buddhapratimā The cult objects found at Phanigiri include footprints of the Buddha (i buddhapāda ) and Buddha images ( bud- dhapratimā). In the earliest phase of Buddhist cultic and narrative art, images of the Buddha were not produced - the Blessed One' presence was often invoked by a throne, a bodhi- tree, or a royal para- sol. The representation of the Buddha in this manner has been called "aniconic", a classification which has given rise to much debate. I find the classification unsatis- factory for several reasons - because of the shifting and multiple connotations of the term "icon", especially in twentieth century discourse, and because as focal points for worship and commemoration the footprints themselves functioned as icons in the extended sense. The point is rather that the representation was "non- figural" and "non-anthropomorphic" - it did not attempt to depict the Buddha as a human figure14. 10. Soundararajan 2006, PI. CC. 11.

This statement may need to be revised since the "Excavation Report" for 2002-2003 (see above n. 4) mentions renovation to the stupa in Visņukuņdin times (fourth-fifth centuries). 14. On this controversial subject see e.g. Karlsson 1999, van Kooij 1999, and Seckel 2004. Here I can- not venture even into the peripheries of the pro- jected, intricate, and often polemical debate. 98 Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 5 Octagonal pillar inscription, reign of the Iksvāku king Rudrapurusadatta. In art historical writing, this earli- est period of Buddhist art in India is often described as an "aniconic period". Even if we accept the conventional term "aniconic", we cannot accept that there was an aniconic period which was superseded by "iconic" art or by an "iconic period". The "aniconic" is a mode of reference which has continued to be used up to the present day. Bodhi- tree shrines or footprint pavilions as cult objects are widespread in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. In narrative the "aniconic" and the "iconic" are modes of reference than can exist side by side, without competition or confusion. This is seen at Phanigiri itself. The infant Bodhisattva is depicted non-fig- urally by a pair of footprints in the scenes of his birth and of his presentation to the fam- ily deity, but as a young prince he is depicted figurally in the episodes of the "three sights" (see below), the meditation, and the last night in the palace. These scenes are all on the same architrave - there is no doubt that they are contemporary or that they are products of a single and unified conception. We have already noted that two large pairs of footprints were placed at the level of the apsidal halls (fig. 6). In front of the caitya within Apsidal hall 2 (fig. 4) was a raised platform for a footprint slab. The limestone slab carved with a pair of buddhapāda bearing auspicious signs was recovered in perfect condition. A short brāhmī inscription dated to circa the first to second centuries CE is inscribed near the toes. In addition, several small buddhapāda fragments were recovered. They all have a many-spoked wheel in the centre; on one of the better-preserved fragments (fig. 7) a nandyãvarta and pair of fish 0 matsya - yugala) are placed on the heel, below the wheel {cakra), while above the wheel are an elephant goad (ańkuśa) and an auspicious seat (bhadrapītha). The toes have svastika on their tips. On other fragments the toes are marked with the nandyãvarta 15 . Two large images of the standing Buddha were excavated, both in classical 15. For early footprints with auspicious signs, many of them from Andhra, see Quagliotti 1998 and Rao 2005: pls. 1-6 (from Andhra); for the buddhapāda in the British Museum see Knox 1992: 211-214. Andhra style, with the robe draped over the left shoulder and the right shoulder bare. One image (fig. 8) is partly intact, but the head, right arm, and feet are broken off. The second image (fig. 9) is in large fragments, but can be seen to be similar in style. In addition, a fine sculpture of a standing royal figure (fig. 10), also headless, was retrieved. The virile figure, masterfully carved in the round, stands with his right arm at his waist. He wears necklaces and brace- lets. On the little finger of his right hand is a ring. III. Narrative: the life of the Buddha Two architraves from a stone toraņa of the stupa (neither, unfortunately, intact) were kept in the field headquar- ters, while several architrave fragments were in the headquarters and on the Fig. 6 Pairs of buddhapāda, Phanigiri hill.

Actual toraņa are rare in the south, though they are depicted in narrative reliefs, for example at Amaravati16. The Phanigiri architraves differ in many respects from their counterparts at Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh or from those depicted in the Begram ivories from Afghanistan. "Architrave 1" is carved with episodes from the life of the Buddha, most of which are identifiable. "Architrave 2" is devoted to post-Nirvana scenes, featuring monks, reliquaries, and snakes. These scenes remain unidentified. 16. Several reliefs from Amaravati in the British Museum collection show toraņa-. see Knox 1992: figs. 37, 83, 85, 86, 103. The biography of the Buddha "Buddha" means "Awakened One". Awakening - an ultimate insight into reality that frees an individual from the round of rebirth - is a state to be achieved with great difficulty after a long quest, over countless lifetimes. The man we call "the Buddha" was not born as an awakened one, and in the period prior to his Awakening he is called a Bodhisattva: freely, one devoted to or destined for Awakening. "Bodhisattva" is used both for his previous births and for his last life up to the moment of awakening (although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably). There is no "standard" or "official" biography of the Buddha. Episodes from the Master's life, including "autobiograph- ical" recollections, are scattered here and there in the early sutra and vinaya collections of the different schools. After the Buddha's death, these episodes were woven into longer narratives, originally oral and sometimes in verse, and in due course a number of "biographies" were compiled and eventually written down. The aim of the compilers was to glorify the Buddha, and to inspire and instruct - to fashion and transmit an image of an ideal Teacher rather than to preserve historical memories of a human life. The biographies, composed in different places and different periods, were transmitted 100 Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008</page><page sequence="6">in Indian languages and later translated into Chinese, Tibetan, and other lan- guages. Since many of the early Indian texts are lost, we often have to rely on the surviving translations, especially the early Chinese translations. To study the life of the Buddha we must examine these different accounts, and compare them with the archaeological and art- historical record, always remembering that the written texts are often younger than the early stone reliefs. Although the biographies agree on the main events of the life, there are many differences in detail, including in the sequence of events. Some of the episodes are "floating'' - that is, in dif- ferent texts and traditions they occur at different points in the Buddha's life. A precious feature of the unbroken sections of the Phanigiri architraves is that episodes are preserved on the architraves themselves in their original sequences; as a result we can determine how the biography was envisaged at Phanigiri. In contrast, the Gandharan panels on the life of the Buddha, origi- nally set around the drums of stupas, are for the most past scattered in dif- ferent collections, with the result that the original sequence is incomplete and disturbed. Our concern here is not the so-called "historical Buddha", whose demytholo- gized biography was constructed start- ing from the mid-nineteenth century in Europe, but rather the "integral" Buddha - the Buddha as described in Fig. 8 Statue of standing Buddha (1). Fig. 9 Statue of standing Buddha (2).

This was the Buddha who inspired people across India and across Asia. The birth of the Buddha Tradition states - unanimously, I believe - that the Bodhisattva was born from his mother's right side as she stood beneath a tree. The Phanigiri birth scene (fig. 11) orig- inally began a series of architrave reliefs, as can be seen from the fact that it is carved on a die issuing from the mouth of a water- monster 0 makara :), a characteristic of the known Phanigiri architraves (see below). The die has been broken off, and its original position or relation to the surviving archi- trave fragments remains to be determined. The Bodhisattva's mother stands holding a branch, while four deities - most probably the Four Great Kings, guardians of the four quarters of the universe - stand ready to receive the infant on a cloth (or, if we follow texts which may be later than the carving, an antelope skin). This is the common way to depict the birth in Andhra art, for exam- ple at Amaravati and Kanaganahalli17. 17. For Amaravati see Knox 1992: figs. 41 (mid- dle), 61 (bottom right); for a broken panel from Kanaganahalli see Das 2004 pl. XIII. Architrave i, Face i Presentation of the infant Bodhisattva to the tutelary deity Four scenes from the life of the Bodhisattva can be read, from the view- er's right to left, on Face 1 of Architrave 1. The first scene is in the die at the beginning of the architrave (fig. 12). The infant Bodhisattva, represented by a pair of footprints on a cloth, is car- ried in procession to receive blessings from the tutelary deity of the Śakya clan. But the deity turns within his shrine and raises his hands to pay homage to the Bodhisattva. The roles have been Fig. 10 Statue of standing royal figure. 102 Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008</page><page sequence="8">reversed: instead of offering homage to the deity, the Bodhisattva receives hom- age from the deity. The depiction of the event is close to those at Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda18. Three encounters In the second scene (fig. 13), the prince emerges from his charmed life in the pal- ace in a chariot drawn by four horses. He encounters three aspects of the human condition that he had not met with before: illness, old age, and death. In the fore- ground is a sick man, lying propped up by his arm on the ground. Just above is a vieillard, his hands raised as he pleads for charity or succour. In the background lamenting relatives bear a shrouded corpse to the burial or cremation ground. These three encounters with reality prompt the Bodhisattva to realize that life is imperma- nent and suffering - that all beings must get sick, grow old, and eventually die. The experience generates a mental revolu- tion - the Bodhisattva decides to seek the way beyond suffering, to seek release from illness, old age and death19. The chariot- Fig. 11 The birth of the Buddha: architrave fragment. eer plays a key role in this drama. It is the charioteer who explains the encounters to the Bodhisattva, and it is the charioteer who brings the Bodhisattva to realize that all beings, himself included, are subject to disease, ageing, and death. In indication of this, the relief portrays the charioteer and the Bodhisattva engaged in conversation. It has become common to expect "four sights" - the three depicted at Phanigiri plus an ascetic {sramaņa), the sight of whom leads the Bodhisattva to the path of renun- ciation and liberation. The present relief, however, shows only three encounters - the renunciant is nowhere to be seen. In fact, the textual traditions are not unanimous on the details of this episode20. In some texts the prince leaves the palace and sees all four sights on a single day. In others, he leaves the palace four times, each time meeting one of the sights. But in other texts the Bodhisattva sees three sights and then goes to meditate under a tree (a jambu tree, according to most texts). One of the oldest extant biog- raphies is the Sanskrit Buddhacarita, com- posed by the master-poet Ašvaghosa in the first or second century CE. In Chapter 3 of the Buddhacarita (as well as in its Chinese translation), the Bodhisattva-Prince takes three excursions from the palace in a char- iot drawn by four horses. He meets in suc- cession an old man, a sick man, and a corpse carried by four men on a bier21. The fourth vision, that of the renunciant or sramaņa does not come until Chapter 5, when the Bodhisattva is seated beneath the jambu - tree22. The narrative sequence is similar in the Liudu ji jing , a compendium of jātaka and narratives translated by Kang Senghui in the first half of the third century23. Meditation beneath the jambu tree I identify the next scene as the Bodhisattva seated in meditation beneath a jambu tree (fig. 14). If this is correct, the figure to the Bodhisattva's right is his father, who is accompanied by members of his harem24. The meditation under the jambu Fig. 12 The infant Bodhisattva, represented by a pair of footprints on a cloth, is presented to the tutelary deity of the Śakya clan. 18.

Fig. 14 The Bodhisattva-Prince seated beneath the jambu tree. tree is another "floating event", placed at dif- ferent points in different traditions. In sev- eral early texts, including the Buddhacarita and the Liudu fi fing , the meditation occurs after the three encounters and before the departure from the palace - just as at Phanigiri25. In other well-known texts, how- ever, the meditation takes place when the Bodhisattva is a young boy, before his mar- riage and before the encounters26. In at least one biography, preserved in Chinese, the meditation follows the Great Departure27. The different versions of the epi- sode diverge considerably on several key points28. According to the Buddhacarita , one day the prince rode forth to enjoy the forest. On the way he observed newly ploughed fields; he saw the creatures killed by the ploughs and witnessed the suffering of the farmers and draught oxen as they toiled in the hot sun. This gave rise to com- passion and to an awareness of the unsat- isfactory nature of existence. The prince stopped beneath a tree and entered medi- tation. Later his father became anxious and went in search of him, rejoicing when he found him safely seated in the shade. Ašvaghosa says nothing about the mir- acle that is normally taken as character- istic of the episode. In other versions, the prince sits motionless in profound medita- tion beneath the tree; as the day passes, the shade moves with the sun, but an umbrella of shadow continues to shelter the medi- tating Bodhisattva. When the king comes 25. Buddhacarita V, 8-22; Xiuxing benqi jing (Taishõ 184) in Zürcher 1978: 78-79 and Karetzky 1992: 52; Sanghabhedavastu in Gnoli 1977: 76-77. 26.

The variations and intertextu- alities of the different accounts - which include early sutra passages and internal cross-references - are far too complex to summarize here. Note that Jnānagupta also translated the RāDtrapālaparipDcchā. 104 Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 15 Eve of the great departure: the Bodhisattva-Prince in the palace. back he is astonished by the miracle, and pays homage to his own son. The Liudu ji jing states that the Bodhisattva went out one day and saw the suffering caused by the ploughing. He sat beneath a tree (the name is not given) and entered meditation. The brief account is close to that of Aávaghosa, but it continues with the miracle of the umbrella of shadow. Chapter 11 of the Lalitavistara gives two versions of the event, one in mixed prose and verse and another in the form of a verse recapitulation. Both tellings introduce fur- ther narrative elements, but they broadly resemble the Buddhacarita said Liudu ji jing versions. The accounts of the Mahāvastu and the Fo ben xing ji jing (translated by *Jñanagupta at the end of the sixth cen- tury during the Sui dynasty) are intimately related to the Lalitavistara account29. The Pali Jātakanidāna, the youngest Indie version of the life of the Buddha to be con- sulted here, is radically different. The young Bodhisattva is taken along by his father King Śuddhodana when he goes to the fields to lead a "ploughing festival" (vappamaňgala). The king leaves the prince in the shade of a jambu tree at the edge of the fields. But the prince does not observe the ploughing; rather, he enters meditation. This event takes place before what the Pali text calls "the four omens" (cattāri pubbanimittāni ). The different versions serve contrasting ends. The Buddhacarita , the Liudu ji jing , and the Lalitavistara emphasize the Bodhisattava's inner world - his compassion, insight, and meditation. This is reflected in an icon which apparently began in Gandhara and became popular in China and Japan, known as the "reflecting" or "pondering" image30. The Jātakanidāna emphasizes royal pomp and ceremony, the miracle of the shade of the jambu tree, and the meditation. The last night in the palace The last preserved scene on Face 1 of Architrave 1 depicts the Bodhisattva- Prince in the palace (fig. 15). The prince contemplates his consort (to his left with her right arm raised) and the women of the harem as they sleep in disarray. He is overcome by revulsion - in the deep of 29.

Sitapati and Sastry identify an unusual sculp- tured slab from the Sri Amareswara Swamy temple as "Siddhartha's last glance of Yasodhara and Rahula" (1980: pl. 3 and pp. 8-12). I remain to be convinced. the night the harem has lost its glamour. The scene is depicted in similar fashion at Amaravati. In neither case is there any sign of the Bodhisattva's baby son Rāhula. There are several narrative traditions regarding when Rāhula was born. According to one, he was born before the Bodhisattva set out in quest of liberation. This tradition is presented, for example, in Ašvaghosa's Buddhacarita 31 . According to another tra- dition, the Bodhisattva leaves the palace just after Rāhula's conception, and the baby remains in his mother's womb for six years, to be born at the same moment that the Bodhisattva, several hundred kilometres away, achieves Awakening32. The absence of Rāhula may indicate that Phanigiri and Amaravati follow the latter tradition33. The great departure An architrave fragment shows the Bodhisattva departing on horseback (fig. 16); the figure of the Bodhisattva is broken off but the front legs of the horse are pre- served, supported by turbaned deities who rise up from the earth. In front of them two more figures emerge from the earth with raised and cupped hands - are they paying homage, or waiting to receive the next step of the horse? The first sports a head-dress, the second is a nāga. The scene is broken off, but at the head of the procession one can see two figures, one nearly intact. He car- ries a sheathed sword over his left shoulder, and wears a short tunic. The extraordinary feature of this relief is a figure who stands dramatically directly in front of the depart- ing Bodhisattva. His left arm rests at his waist, with fist clenched, while he raises his right arm as if to forbid the Bodhisattva from proceeding. Who is this figure? Can it be Māra, the Tempter, the powerful lord of the gods of Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 16 Architrave fragment: The great departure. one of the sensual realms? In the depar- ture narratives of two texts that survive only in Chinese translation, Māra inter- cepts the Bodhisattva as he sets forth. In one he carries a bow and arrows, and ques- tions the prince, but does not, apparently, try to obstruct him. In a second text Māra attempts to frighten away the Bodhisattva by conjuring up loud noises, a torrent, and a fiercely burning conflagration, all without success34. The relief and the Chinese ver- sions do not fit very closely. In the majority of texts and visual repre- sentations, Māra does not play any role in the 34. Beai 1875: 137.

A notable exception is the Jātakanidāna , in which Māra appears in the air in front of the Bodhisattva and unsuc- cessfully tries to convince him to return to the palace and enjoy sovereignty36. Up to the present Southeast Asian traditions - for example Thai and Khmer painting and nar- ratives - follow the Jātakanidāna version, or more precisely, its descendents such as the Pathamasambodhi. But the Jātakanidāna is later than the Phanigiri reliefs, and there are no parallels to the Phanigiri relief in Andhra art. At Amaravati a figure dances in front of the departing Bodhisattva; the figure is damaged, but his posture does not seem obstructive or aggressive. The lack of narrative or visual evidence leaves the iden- tity of the Phanigiri figure unresolved, but the question is worth pursuing. Architrave i, Face 2 The surviving section of Face 2 of Architrave 1 continues the narrative from the previous side, depicting the assault of Māra and the events that follow (fig. 17)37. Several scenes leading up to the victory over Māra are missing due to the breakage; one possible candidate is Sujātā's offering. I read four scenes, from right to left: the assault of Māra, the offering of bowls by the Four Great Kings, the first offering of food by the merchants Trapusa and Bhallika, and the first sermon given by the Buddha38. The first three events progress seamlessly from one to the other. The fourth event is framed separately in a die. 35.

One scene that follows the Great Departure was apparently not depcited on an architrave but on a slab: the scene in which the gods lift the Bodhisattva's turban up to heaven. 38. We do not know how the names of the two mer- chants would have been spelt in the texts used at Phanigiri or in Andhra. I adopt for convenience the spelling of the Mahāvastu.

The Four Great Kings offer bowls The next two scenes belong together. Two passing merchants, Trapusa and Bhallika by name, prepare to offer food to the newly awakened Buddha.

Unidentified scenes. - realize that the Buddha needs a bowl with which to receive the food, and they appear together before him, each with a bowl to offer. The Buddha accepts all four vessels and merges them into a sin- gle bowl. After the donation of the food, the Buddha rejoices in the merchant's offering by reciting some verses. The episode became prominent in the ideology of offering (dāna) and is among the texts that would have inspired mer- chants to support the Buddhist order. The merchants Trapusa and Bhallika were "canonized" as foremost among the lay-followers of the Buddha who first took refuge in the Buddha. The merchant community was of key importance in the early diffusion of Buddhism. The verses circulated independently to be recited as blessings, often in expanded form. As for the bowl, it became an important relic and took on a life of its own39. The merchants' offering In this scene, the merchants Trapusa and Bhallika offer food to the newly awakened one. One of them stands to the fore, and pours water onto the hands of the Buddha who, seated on a low stool, is shown from the side. The side view of the Buddha in this posture is, as far as I know, distinctive to Andhra sculpture. In a slab from Nagarjunakonda, to the left the Buddha sits in the same posture on a lion- throne beneath the bodhi-tree , receiving the bowls from the Four Kings. To the right one of the two merchants pours water onto the Buddha's right hand40. The costume and hair-style of the traders is very close to that of the Phanigiri relief. In a frieze from Goli, the Blessed One sits on a square seat, again in side view, as he receives an offering from Sujātā before the awakening41. She pours water over his outstretched hands. All of these sculpted panels follow a very similar idiom. The first sermon The final scene in this series, set within its own rectangular frame in a die at the 39.

The Buddha is seated on a square throne, in half crossed-leg posture. His left hand lies in his lap; his right hand is raised with thumb and index finger touch- ing42. Below the throne is a pair of gazelles, similar to those at Goli and other Andhra sites43. To the Buddha's left are five ador- ing ascetics with tapering beards and with their hair tied into topknots. These are the Buddha's five former companions in rig- orous asceticim and self-mortification, to whom the Blessed One gives his first ser- mon. On the Buddha's right are adoring deities. Above his halo rises a blazing radi- ance, within which is a wheel - presumably a reference to the "wheel of the dharma". Similar radiances are seen in non-fig- ural representations of the Buddha from Amaravati, where the Buddha is depicted as a blazing pillar44. Architrave 2, Face A I have not found any texts or parallel visual representations that can explain the narratives on Architrave 2, and I cannot determine their order or sequence with any certainty. The Buddha is not shown; rather, there are reliquaries, monks, and royal figures. This leads me to interpret the scenes as taking place after the Buddha's death. But where does the narrative begin? Where does it end? I provisionally read Face A of Architrave 2 (fig. 19) from right to left, and divide it into three main scenes, 42. I eschew the use of the Sanskrit " mudrā vocab- ulary" which is de rigueur in art-historical writing. In its developed form this vocabulary belongs to North India of the Pāla period or later. It is inap- propriate to use it for the earlier art of any period in India or elsewhere, including Southeast Asia. The use of the vocabulary as a specialized argot of art historians has created an ahistorical system of reference which obscures the fact that we do not know what the gestures were called or what they meant at the time and place in question. A study of the evolution of the terms for gestures and postures is a desideratum. 43. Ramachandran 1929, pl. XI, No. 8. 44. See Barrett 1954: fig.

In the first scene two monks cross-leg- ged in a rocky landscape. The one on the right is seated beneath a tree. Perched on a crag just behind the tree, to the viewer's left, is a peacock. Below the monk's seat are a water-vessel and a crouching gazelle. The monk's face is turned towards a royal couple, who kneel to the right with hands raised. Two damaged figures with hands raised stand behind them; originally there were three, but the third has been broken off. The monk on the viewer's left has one hand raised in a gesture of teaching. Below his seat is a water-vessel. His face is turned towards two royally attired figures, both males, whose hands are raised in homage. They both have haloes: can they be gods (i deva )? Behind the two males are four ladies, seated with hands raised in hom- age. Above the scene are two more monks. One holds up his hand to restrain two ser- pents ( naga ), one of them five-headed, who approach through the air for the left. The next scene shows two royal fig- ures riding towards the left on elephant back; seated behind them is an umbrella- bearer. A standard bearer follows behind on foot. To the proper right of the ele- phant is a horse rider. Two foot-soldiers, one bearing a sheathed sword over his left shoulder, are alongside the elephant. In front of the elephant are two shield- bearers, another standard-bearer, and several others, including a drummer. In the final scene, in the framed die, twelve monks, six on each side, stand by a caitya pillar, eight of them holding lotuses in their right hands (fig. 20). Their robes are draped over their left shoul- ders, leaving their right shoulders bare. In the background is a pair of trees. Architrave 2, Face B On Face B of Architrave 2 I read five scenes from right to left, following the right to left sequence of Architrave 1 (fig. 21). The first scene, in the die, shows monks, some holding lotuses in their hands, paying homage to a caitya pillar. As in the previous scene, their robes are draped over their left shoulders, leav- ing their right shoulders bare. The sec- ond scene shows a couple, a male and a Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008 '''</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 24 Medallion depicting jātaka. female, seated beside a lotus pond. The man raises his hands in homage; the woman holds something - an incense burner? - in her right hands. Behind the pond to the left are two trees; behind the woman a five-headed serpent raises his hoods. Can this be a scene of serpent worship? The third scene shows eight monks, their right shoulders bare, paying homage to a caitya pillar. The four on the viewer's left raise their hands, palms held together in homage. Of the four on the viewer's right, one of the two at the back raises Fig. 25 Auspicious symbols on stone disc. 112 Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008</page><page sequence="18">his palms, while the hands of the second monk cannot be seen. The two monks in the foreground raise their right arms above their heads while holding their left arms close to the chest. This I interpret as a gesture of salutation or homage. Scene four depicts caitya worship. The caitya stands within a low enclosure, the gate of which is flanked by dwarves car- rying trays of garlands on their heads. The caitya itself is topped by a parasol {chátrá) and a pair of streamers {patáka); the main dome is garlanded. The worship of caitya is a common theme in early Buddhist art, for example at Amaravati. The celebration of relics is frequently conducted by deities or lay followers - to have three scenes with monks as at Phanigiri is unusual. The fifth and final scene on the surviv- ing section of the architrave is the most baffling. Two monks face each other at the centre, with lively gestures as if they are in debate; their postures suggest that they are about to spring into the air45. Below the monks' feet two figures rise from the earth with hands raised. They appear to be hooded - are they serpent deities ( nāga )? Other monks surround the two monks, showing intense interest in their actions. IV Architecture and style I have noted that the Phanigiri archi- traves are unique in style. It is not yet clear how many architraves there were or how they were placed. Apart from the two main architraves there are several smaller architrave fragments that preserve single narratives, some of which I cannot iden- tify. These fragments do not belong to the two large architraves, but the identi- fiable scenes seem to belong to the life of Fig. 26 Figures and patterns: top of pillar underneath stone disc. the Buddha. This shows that there must have been at least one more architrave devoted to early episodes - perhaps the Bodhisattva's sojourn in Tusita Heaven, his descent from Tusita,46 Queen Maya's dream, and the interpretation of the dream, all of which are depicted elsewhere in Andhra art47. The two relatively intact architraves are extraordinary pieces. The end-piece of each architrave has two distinct sections, 45. Cf. the "flying scenes" of Andhra art, for exam- ple at Stone 1994: fig. 179. 46. One fragment is a possible candidate for this episode. 47. For Amaravati see Stern and Bénisti 1961: pl.

Arts Asiatiques Tome 63 - 2008 113</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 27 "Amorous couple." made up of a pair of addorsed creatures separated by a band in the middle. In the extant pieces a dramatic sea-monster 0 makara ) faces the architraves proper, and holds the rectangular die in its widely stretched jaws while an addorsed animal faces outward. Architrave 1 ends in an elephant with two riders; Architrave 2 terminates with a lion with a single rider, as does the fragment with the birth of the Buddha. The architraves count among the masterpieces of Phanigiri art. The clos- est parallel to the ends that I know of is a single broken piece kept in the museum at Hyderabad: a water-lion with a single rider addorsed with a makara 48. Similar also are the carvings at the two ends of long narrative reliefs at Nagarjunakonda; here a voluptuous maiden perches on the addorsed animals49. Many of the motifs used at Phanigiri are found at other sites in Andhra. Examples include running animals and owls, the latter in repeated series sup- porting an upper range of sculpture. The same convention is used at Amaravati and at Goli50. Another shared convention is the use of city walls as dividers or frames, again seen at Amaravati and at Goli51. Stone slabs are decorated with jātaka and lotus medallions, with vertical carv- ings of smaller medallions and adoring figures. The function of the slabs is not yet clear to me - some may be drum casings or projections of an entrance to the circu- mambulatory. They resemble the gates or stupa enclosures depicted in relief at Amaravati52. At Phanigiri, Amaravati, and throughout India the lotus medallion is a popular motif. In the vertical sections at Phanigiri, the devotees, here in groups of three, are lively and graceful; one of the figures has wings (fig. 22), and may be a garuda. Does this suggest that the other figures are divine? One of the medallions depicts a cakra- vartin king or "Wheel-turning Emperor" (fig. 23). He is surrounded by his seven ratna or "precious jewels": from top right clockwise are the gem (on a pillar at the centre), the elephant, the wheel, the horse, the queen, the treasurer and the com- mander in chief. At the top to the viewer's left is a "conch-treasure" ( śańkha-nidhi ); to the right is a lotus-treasure ( padma - nidhi ). The theme of the cakravartin is prominent in Andhra art, often in the Mandhātā-jātaka 53. In another roundel a royal couple sits at ease on a spacious seat. The male dangles a flower in front of a sheep, held up by a boy in his arms (fig. 24). The scene, presumably a jātaka , has not been identified54. A stone disc near the top of a detached pillar is carved with exceptional figures (fig. 25). The band at the top has aus- picious symbols - including a garuda , a wheel on a pillar, and a bodhi-tree - alternating with lotus flowers. Below the disks are bands of lively figures (fig. 26), 55 including what in the litera- ture is often called an "amorous couple" (fig. 27). Two pillar bases have complex patterns of linked flowers (fig. 28)56. Concluding questions What can Phanigiri teach us? Can it tell us anything about the spread of the Vinaya schools or monastic orders in ancient Andhra Pradesh? So far, it cannot. No inscriptions mentioning the Buddhist orders have been discov- ered (or at least published). The mate- rial remains - stupas, Buddha images, narratives of jātakas and the life of the Buddha - are shared by all schools. Can we identify the text used for the life of the Buddha? We cannot - while parallels can be seen in some texts, such as the Buddhacarita , there are differ- ences in the details. The Buddhacarita is a North Indian text, and we do not know whether it circulated in South India at the time the Phanigiri complex was con- structed. In any case, from the variations in the narrative we can conclude that the Buddhacarita was not the source of the Phanigiri version of the life. Nor was the Pali Jātakanidāna , which is later than the Phanigiri reliefs and which is not known to have circulated in Andhra. The life appears to follow a tradition that has not survived in literature57. 48. Stone 1994: fig. 173 and pp. 65-66.

What happened to Phanigiri? It seems to have been abandoned by the fourth century, not much after the later phase of construction. Did it fall victim to the shifting fortunes of trade and power, and lose its patrons and support system? Why are the images and artefacts bro- ken, as if in violent attack? Many ques- tions remain to be answered.
