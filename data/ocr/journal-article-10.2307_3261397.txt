<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Precisely what this would mean in detail for the outline and organization of the material is something which will have to be experimented with, and no one can ever assume that his outline is really satisfactory. Yet while agreeing with Dentan in his objections to Eichrodt's outline, it is nevertheless difficult not to agree with Eichrodt over against Dentan that any outline adopted must be attuned, not to the rubrics of systematic theology, but more in line with the characteristic biblical point of view toward the God who acts his- torically and who is known in the first instance as "the God of Israel." The above remarks should in no way detract from the importance of Dentan's work. It deserves wide and thoughtful reading. Disagreements, and probably misunderstandings, are inevitable because the subject is one in which there is today almost a complete chaos in point of view. G. ERNEST WRIGHT The Theology of the Old Testament, by Otto J. Baab. New York and Nashville: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1949. Pp. 287. $3.50. This is a very sincere attempt to provide a usable theology of the OT for Protestant students and clergy. As such it is a very welcome addition to a field in which current books in English are by no means numerous. Dr. Baab is a professor of OT at Garrett Biblical Institute in Evanston, and his book is the outgrowth of his teaching. He believes that there is such a thing as a biblical faith by which biblical men lived; it is a faith which is capable of being studied as an objective entity in and for itself. Every historical and exegetical tool must be used, but such tools have not been used properly unless they are brought to bear on the central and controlling experience of the men of Israel, the experience of God, and are able "to identify the major concepts of religious experience to the extent that these are amenable to formulation and systemati- zation." Actual inductive study of the material in its historical context proves not only that there was great development and individual variation in belief, but that lying beneath the evolution and the variety are certain major themes which can be analyzed and discussed and which form a theology of the OT, rather than a series of theologies. The author thus seems to feel that the basic unity of the OT is to be found in the religious experience of a continuing community. Actually, however, he is uninterested in the analysis of this experience in and for itself (in the sense, for example, that Paul Minear does in Eyes of Faith). Instead, he con- 397</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE fines his attention to basic religious concepts under the headings: The Meaning of God (Ch. 2), The Nature of Man (Ch. 3), The Idea of Sin (Ch. 4), Salvation (Ch. 5), The Kingdom of God (Ch. 6), Death and the Hereafter (Ch. 7), and The Problem of Evil (Ch. 8). (A final chapter deals with the validity of OT theology.) If the basic unity is to be found in the religious experience of a continuing community, what is the relation of these central concepts to the experience? Are they derived from the experience, and thus constitute in themselves a secondary unity? Or are they more fundamental than that, providing the basis in which the experience was achieved? To this reviewer the author is a bit confusing at this point, and I am still not clear just how the unity of the OT is conceived. What the author seems to be saying in the major portion of the volume is that Israel possessed a certain group of beliefs which one can systematize to a certain extent and which constitute a unity of faith, even though they undergo many individual and historical variations. From the above it will be noted that Baab's approach to his task is along the lines of the older theologies like that of Davidson, in which one attempts to isolate, rearrange, and translate the materials which may be used to describe the faith into as abstract, general, and universal terms as is convenient and possible (thus God, man, sin, salvation, kingdom, etc.). It is inevitable that this be done, and precisely for this reason no theology of the OT will ever be completely satisfactory. For one thing, faith, while including within its scope generalized abstractions and dogma, is greater than these and defies complete systematization and the translation of its concrete language into abstract uni- versals. For another thing, the interests, insight, background and training of the modern writer play a major role in the selection and presentation. It was stated at the outset that this book is primarily directed to Protestants, though it is improbable that the author meant it so. Yet any work on the OT satis- factory to the Jews must deal more concretely than this one does with the meaning, substance and setting of the Law. Indeed, it is a question whether even a Protestant can really be satisfied, since the whole question of law and gospel has been of central concern in Protestant theology. Furthermore, those of the Catholic persuasion within Christianity would desire a serious attempt to understand the meaning and forms of Israelite worship, a subject which the book avoids to an even greater extent than it does the Law. A major question in the mind of this reviewer is whether the above seemingly inevitable limitations might be overcome, not entirely but at least partially, by abandoning the older classification derived from dogmatic theology in favor of a different classification derived from the OT itself. For example, 398</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS G. van Rad has shown (Das formgeschichtliche Problem des Hexateuchs, 1938, and Das erste Buck Mose: Genesis Kapitel 1-12:9, 1949) that the framework of the Hexateuch is a kerygmatic proclamation derived and expanded from old cultic confessions and centering in a Heilsgeschichte. After the introduction in Gen. 1-11, the central events are God's call to the fathers (the election of Israel), the deliverance at the Exodus (to which the Sinai covenant has been joined, so that the two together present the two basic elements of all biblical proclamation, the Gospel and the Law of God), and the gift of the land or the inheritance. These elements contain the kerygmatic core of the OT to which the later writers appeal as the normative constituents of the faith (cf. also the apostolic preaching in Acts). Would it not be possible, therefore, for the OT theologian to begin with this kerygma and to conceive of his task as primarily concerned with the exposition of its meaning, its constituent elements, its implications, and its historical ramifications? If this were done, then something of the static character of the older approach might be avoided. One must agree with Baab that the place to begin is with the doctrine of God. Yet the apprehension of God in Israel was not by means of abstract generalizations, but through the interpretation of historical acts. And chief among these acts was the election of Israel. Consequently, it would appear that the point of beginning should be not simply with God, but with the phrase "the God of Israel;" and this immediately involves a consideration of election, how the conception arose, what it meant for Israel's life, what Israel inferred about the nature of God from it, etc. (Baab accords this topic 1h pages only in his chapter on the Kingdom.) Similarly, one might deal with the Exodus deliverance and with the covenant. The latter is certainly of crucial importance, since it provided not only the context in which the Divine require- ment was understood, but also the basic conceptual language in which the meaning and implications of the election for the national life were compre- hended. Fundamental to any faith are the particular language and metaphors used, the meaning and implications of which must be examined together with the soil from which they are derived and the reasons for the derivation. While Baab mentions the covenant frequently, it is subjected to explicit treatment on two pages only in the chapter on Salvation. The above is certainly not the only approach which might be made, yet something along this line might avoid the limitations of the older methodol- ogy derived from dogmatic theology. It would lend itself to a more complete treatment of the faith, while at the same time it would keep in the foreground the central, kerygmatic nature of the faith together with the historical basis 399</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE on which it rested, which after all are perhaps the primary points of differentia- tion between the faith of the Bible and those of other religions. Any reader of such a volume would undoubtedly desire to register many points in detail at which he would differ. To this reviwer, for example, the treatment of Baalism was far from satisfactory, involving what seemed to be an unclear conception of the structure of polytheistic faith. Perhaps it is the individualistic opinion of this reviewer, but the whole section on "The Spiritual God" (pp. 39 f.) seems somewhat problematical. Unless one were to except John 4 24 (which I should hesitate to do), it seems to me most doubtful that the Bible contains any data which might be said to constitute a doctrine of God's spirituality, in any modern sense at least. Throughout, the language is personal and anthropomorphic, and the passages dealing with God's spirit surely cannot be used as evidence to the contrary. The spirit is a non- anthropomorphized entity created and sent by God to perform his work within human life; it can scarcely be used to define God's being. It is an extension of that being perhaps, but is nevertheless as separate from God as are his angel and the Wisdom of Prov. 8. More disturbing to the reviewer was the lack of clarity, definition, and penetration in dealing with theological issues. The result is that the book is difficult to review, since the impact that it has on the reader is blunted. From the biblical point of view statements such as the following seem somewhat problematical: "Salvation signifies the help that men receive from their religion" (p. 114); a significant point about the conception of God is that "he seeks to save men from their sins and to help them to live a new life" (p. 121). God seeking to save men is certainly at the core of the Bible; but the coupling of this conception with that of helping them to live a new life seems a bit incongruous, perhaps more derived from modern utilitarian Protestantism than from the Bible. The above remarks are certainly inadequate as a review of the book; its contents cover too wide a span of material to summarize here. The dominant impression which the volume gives is that of the earnestness, steady patience, and evangelical interest of the author. No matter how much one may differ in approach or in detail, he cannot but express his appreciation to Baab both for what he has here done and for what he himself is. In this book he has accomplished something which very few American scholars have ever done; indeed, full-dress American volumes on OT theology are not quite but almost non-existent. G.
