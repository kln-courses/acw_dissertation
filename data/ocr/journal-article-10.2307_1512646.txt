<plain_text><page sequence="1">Manet's Woman with a Parrot of 1866 MONA HADLER IN THE Woman with a Parrot of I866 (Figure i), Manet's model, Victorine Meurend, emerges from the background holding the cord of a monocle in her left hand and a bunch of violets in her right.' She stares straight ahead with a fixed gaze matched in intensity by that of the parrot at her side. Manet unites the com- position through careful use of color; the gray of the background reappears both in the folds of the pink dressing gown and, subtly modulated, in the bird's plumage. According to Emile Zola: "Manet would not know how to sing or to philosophize. He has the gift to cap- ture dominant tones in their delicacy."2 Although Zola had the perspicacity to appreciate Manet's excellence as a so-called pure painter-so clearly revealed in the handling of this work-he dismissed the importance of subject matter in Manet's oeuvre. Zola's approach was adopted by the art critics of the i86os, who, even while critical of the painting, focused on its formal qualities. Gautier wrote in i868: "but when in a painting there is neither composition, nor drama, nor poetry, the technique must be perfect. And here this is not the case.... The head he shows us is certainly not flattering. Over commonplace and poorly drawn features he spreads an earthy color which does not represent the flesh tint of a young woman's fair complexion."3 Manet's art, leaving aside the question I. I thank Professor Theodore Reff for specific references as well as for general guidance on this study. 2. Emile Zola, Salons (Paris, 1959) p. 92. 3.

This is the case with several paintings of the i86os. It is well known, for example, that Manet's Dejeuner sur l'Herbe was inspired both by Raphael's Judgment of Paris and Giorgione's Fete Champetre, his Old Musician alludes to the Drinkers by Velazquez, and the Olympia is based on Titian's Venus of Urbino. Manet combines this knowledge of older art with an interest in specifically contemporary themes. The Olympia is one example of this (Figure 2). Theodore Reff points out that in spite of her dependence on Titian's Venus she is without doubt a Parisian of the i86os.4 By carefully altering aspects of the painting, Manet changes Titian's languid Venus into a haughty, self-assured courtesan of the mid-nineteenth century. He replaces the dog, a traditional symbol of fidelity, with an alley cat--in Manet's circle, an animal associ- ated with promiscuity. In fact, Manet illustrated the chapter on cats' sexual habits in Champfleury's mono- graph on cats. In the Olympia Victorine stares straight ahead proudly as her maid brings in a large bouquet, both a gift from an admirer and a tribute to her power. It was, in fact, during the Second Empire that the cour- tesan attained a greater position of wealth and influence in Parisian society.5 Hence, in the Olympia, Manet has subtly woven together aspects of older art and contem- 4.

The Woman with a Parrot was completed only a year after Manet exhibited the Olympia and has cer- tain similarities in content and approach. In both, his model Victorine is associated with flowers and a pet animal. Although in the Woman with a Parrot Victor- ine is not a courtesan, but a lady wearing a dressing gown, and her pet is not a cat, but a parrot, there is in this painting, as in the Olympia, a broader significance based on both traditional and mid-nineteenth-century concepts. Of foremost importance in this painting is the rela- tionship of the woman and the parrot. Manet empha- sizes the connection between Victorine and her pet through their physiognomic similarity. He tilts her head to the side to show the full view of her left eye. The shadow under this eye is darkened and extended to meet the elongated eyebrow, creating a pictorial shape analogous to the eye of the bird. This formal similarity immediately suggests a relationship between the two on a fundamental level. This is not a unique occurrence in Manet's oeuvre. One year later in his Portrait of Zola, Manet included a photograph of FIGURE 2 Olympia, by Edouard Manet. Oil on canvas.

As a tribute to the critic Manet turns Olympia's eyes toward Zola, thereby con- necting the author with the subject of his writings.6 During the nineteenth century parrots were esteemed for their intelligence and anthropomorphic qualities. In France they were common pets, prized above all, according to the Larousse-a basic source on nineteenth- century customs and ideas-for their ability to imitate the human voice.7 Rather than using the traditional green bird here, Manet has specifically depicted the ash-colored, red-tailed parrot called the Jaco. This type, indigenous to Africa, was most appreciated by Europeans because it had, "to the highest degree the qualities that characterize parrots."8 In a scientific study of parrots published in 1836, theJaco is described as "remarkable for its docility and mimicry, the faculty it possesses of imitating the human voice.... it sur- passes the rest of its species, on which account it has always been held in high estimation by the bird fan- cier. . . "9 An article from the I834 volume of Le Magasin Pittoresque, a popular French periodical, not only mentions the Jaco as the parrot who speaks most fluently,'1 but considers parrots to be the most intelli- gent of birds and consequently the most suitable com- panions for people." Some believed so strongly in the mental facility of parrots that they consulted parrots on their affairs, even having them select lottery num- bers. The article goes on to state, "The reputation of parrots is so well established that it is not even necessary 6. Reff, "Olympia," p. 112. 7.

In the time of Augustus Caesar parrots were taught to chant together "Ave Caesar." In the Middle Ages this became associated with "Ave Maria," and ulti- mately the parrot became a symbol of the perpetual virginity of the Virgin. Beginning in the sixteenth century, however, and increasing in the seventeenth century with the growing number of for them to speak in order for us to suppose that they have ideas and feelings analogous to ours."I2 The ver- bal ability of parrots has long been recognized. In fact, they have been traditionally considered a symbol of eloquence. 3 As for the specific relationship between women and parrots, examples in literature and art can be traced back for centuries. The relationship between the two is intimate and borders on the erotic. In the sixteenth century the parrot was associated with courtly love.I4 Many prominent members of the French nobility, in- cluding Marguerite de Valois, Marguerite d'Autriche, and Jeanne d'Albret had pet parrots.'5 It was for Marguerite d'Autriche, the wife of Philibert le Beau, that Jean Lemaire de Belges wrote the poem Les Epitres de l'Amant Vert, in which the parrot is Marguerite's constant companion. The parrot describes her beauti- ful body, whether dressed or half-dressed, which he was privileged to behold. He talks of his growing love for Marguerite and is jealous of her lovers, whose activities he must watch.16 Similar representations depicting the parrot as the intimate companion of the woman, seeing her in a state of partial dress, and sharing knowledge of her personal life, recur over the centuries. They are found frequently in seventeenth century Dutch and Flemish paintings. The Woman with a Parrot by Frans van Mieris (Figure 3) is illustrated in Charles Blanc's Histoire des Peintres-a book consulted frequently by Manet in the I86os.'7 The painting is a genre scene of parrots in Europe due to the explorations of America, the meaning of the parrot became secularized. This secular tradition appears to have continued into the nineteenth century. In fact, whereas the Larousse mentions the "Ave Caesar" (p. 657), there is no discussion of its religious correlate in the Middle Ages. 14.

In Charles Blanc's Histoire des Peintres de Toutes les Ecoles, l'ecole hollandaise, II, p. 2I a woman, dressed in a morning coat, feeding her par- rot. Her affected feminine gestures are similar to Vic- torine's in Manet's work. In Manet's own time there was a resurgence of these ideas about the relationship between women and par- rots. According to the Larousse, it was believed that parrots spoke more readily in the presence of women and children.18 Flaubert's story "A Simple Heart," written in I876, yields another example of the theme. F'licite, a servant woman, becomes deeply attached to her pet: They had conversations with each other, he repeating ad nauseam the three phrases in his repertory, she replying with words which were just as disconnected but which came from the heart. In her isolation Loulou was almost a son or a lover to her. He used to climb up on her fingers, peck at her lips, and hang onto her shawl; and as she bent over him, wagging her head from side to side as nurses do, the great wings of her bonnet and the wings of the bird quivered in unison.I9 Flaubert's last image connects Felicite and Loulou by stressing a point of physical resemblance in much the same way as Manet connects Victorine and her pet by rendering their gazes so similarly. Remarkably, within several years of Manet's paint- ing, at least two more renditions of this theme were produced in his circle. One was a drawing by his close friend Degas.20 Here, as in the case of Victorine, the model wears a dressing gown that is open at the neck. She also gestures with her left hand. Although Degas's drawing is a straightforward rendition of the subject, Degas twenty years later wrote a sonnet about the inti- macy between women and parrots.

The parrot is also referred to as a prophetic bird in Flaubert's Salammb6 (trans. E.

With the tip of his wing, quickly remove A piece of his tongue so that he is silent ... and green.21 The parrot is Mary Cassatt's confidant and shares the secrets of her love life as did the parrot in Lemaire's 20.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art, bequest of Mrs. H. 0. Havemeyer, the H. 0. Havemeyer Collection, 29.100.57 poem. The other rendition of this theme was by Cour- bet in Woman with a Parrot of i866 (Figure 4). This striking reiteration of subject matter did not go un- noticed at the time. Chaumelin wrote in La Presse: "Manet has borrowed the parrot from his friend Cour- bet and has placed it on a perch next to a young woman in a pink dressing gown. These realists are capable of anything!"22 Recently the relationship between Cour- bet and Manet has been a subject for speculation. George Heard Hamilton has suggested that Courbet's fully modeled female of 1866 was in one sense an answer to Manet's Olympia exhibited in the Salon of 865. He notes that the public saw Manet's Woman with a Par- rot, exhibited in the I868 Salon, as a final rebuttal to Courbet.23 It is tempting to speculate on the possibility of closer ties between the two versions of the Woman with a Parrot, but when Courbet's painting was being exhibited in the salon, Manet's was already being shown privately to his friends.24 Since Manet and Courbet knew each other, it is not impossible that Manet was aware of Courbet's painting while it was in process, but the clear systematic order of events is not necessarily valid. Although Courbet's painting is thematically similar 22. A. Tabarant, Manet et Ses Oeuvres (Paris, 1947) p. 149. 23. Hamilton, Manet, p. I I5. 24. Tabarant, Manet, p. 124. I20</page><page sequence="7">to Manet's, there are nevertheless major differences, of which the most important is the sexual. Courbet's work is considerably more overtly erotic.25 Sexual analogies between women and birds occur repeatedly in the his- tory of art. In the seventeenth century birds and women were often so intimately related that the Dutch word vogelen, literally "to sell birds," also meant "to copulate."26 For Manet the subject is not explicitly erotic. In I866 he painted another work of the same theme, treating it as a purely genre subject. In this painting, entitled The Guitar Player,27 Victorine wears a bohe- mian dress, plays a guitar, and is accompanied by a parrot. The meaning of Manet's Woman with a Parrot is also not specifically sexual. The artist chose the gray parrot-known to be the most intelligent and talkative of parrots. He emphasized its relationship to the woman through physiognomic similarities. It would seem that Manet-like Lemaire, Flaubert, and Degas-is plac- ing the parrot in the traditional role of close confidant. The woman's clothes and the objects surrounding her provide clues to the contents of these secrets. The orange at the base of the perch is not a clue but is simply the bird's food. It is not cut but torn open. This is natural, for, in fact, the parrot's beak is particu- larly well suited for breaking the skins and seeds of different kinds of fruit.28 Victorine wears a dressing gown or peignoir.29 Black ribbons with brooches similar to Victorine's were fre- quently illustrated in the fashion magazines of the I86os.30 The women who wore them, however, were either in street clothes or dressed for the theater or a ball (Figure 5).3' Victorine appears to be part of this fashionable world, as evidenced not only by her brooch but by her exaggerated ladylike gestures. However, she seems to be only half elegantly dressed, as if she were dressing for, or coming home from, a ball. 25. Delacroix's Woman with a Parrot of 1827 falls into this aspect of the tradition. It is illustrated in Eugene Delacroix, Gabriel Maurey, ed. (Paris, 1927) pl. 3. 26. E. de Jongh, "Erotica in Vogelperspectief," Simiolus 3 (1969) p. 72, treats this subject in detail with many illustrations. 27.

Manet himself con- nects violets with balls in his painting The Bouquet of Violets of I872.32 Here the violets are juxtaposed with a fan and a dance card with Berthe Morisot's name inscribed on it. In the nineteenth century violets were proverbially associated with modesty.33 Perhaps this accounts for the exaggeratedly dainty gesture. Victor- pink peignoir smelling a bouquet of violets.

The monocle is an unusual-if not shocking-detail, as testified to by a contemporary caricature (Figure 6). Here the monocle, disproportionately large, becomes an object of ridicule. Richard Corson writes that in the FIGURE 6 Caricature by Gil of Manet's Woman with a Parrot, i868. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift of Albert TenEyck Gardner, 64.693 nineteenth century only the lorgnette was considered truly elegant for women.34 As for monocles, they were originally used largely by older men, but later were adopted by younger men to conform to the fashion.35 Although Corson refers to a passing phase in the i82os when women wore monocles, it seems that by the mid- century fashionable women carried lorgnettes and fash- ionable men wore monocles. Consequently one can speculate that Victorine's monocle is actually a man's monocle. Accordingly, the flowers could also be a gift from a man as they were in the Olympia. Victorine in the Woman with a Parrot is not, how- ever, a courtesan, as she is in the Olympia, but appears to be a fashionable Parisian of the I86os. She wears a peignoir open at the top and jewelry around her neck as if she is in the process of dressing, perhaps getting ready for a ball. As in the Olympia she stares sugges- tively at us. At the same time Victorine smells her corsage and holds the cord of the monocle. If the flowers are related to the ball-most likely a gift from a gentleman-and the monocle is a man's monocle, then we are provided with the ambience and the clues to the romantic nature of the shared secrets behind the knowing stare of Victorine and her gray confidant. In accordance with the traditional iconography Victor- ine's parrot is her intimate companion, sees her in the process of dressing, and appears to share the secrets of her personal life. 34.
