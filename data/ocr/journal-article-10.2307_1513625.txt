By the time he made the Lehman Madonna, Andrea had for some years been _ i chiefly responsible for the output of the family shop in Vial ' Guelfa. Though he was a faithful follower of his uncle's style, his own personality emerged distinctly in works such as this, with its exceptionally high relief, in which he achieved monu- mental forms without sacrificing any of that sweetness and harmony of expression for which Luca is so admired. The Lehman Madonna is of approximately the same period as the Museum's St. Michael lunette from Faenza (60.127.2), datable about 1475. Three early Madonnas closely similar in size and shape are in Florence: one is in the church of S. Gaetano, another is in S. Egidio, and the Madonna of the Architects (1475) is in the Bargello.

During this apprenticeship he executed a number of marble sculptures, although he was still legally ineligible to receive commissions or payments on his own; it is only recently that his hand has been identified in these works, officially recorded in his father's name. The present group, unknown and undocumented, passed through several public sales before it was recognized by scholars who had become familiar with other of Bernini's early pieces that have come to light in the past few years. Ours is the most ambitious of these and provides exciting insights into the crucial shift in style that took place in Rome during the first quarter of the seventeenth century. The subject is a somewhat mysterious one, having its ori- gins, but no precise analogue, in the Bacchic revels of classical and Renaissance iconography. A beatifically inebriated faun grasps at and attempts to mount a fig tree twisted with grape- vines. Higher up in the tree, two children teasingly fend off his efforts, but so precarious are their perches that they seem not to fly but to leap through the air in miraculous defiance of gravity. Another, less cheerful, child, his spread-legged pose echoing the faun's, sprawls in alarm across the back of a lioness who stretches up to nibble at a bunch of grapes. Some have seen in this tangle a struggle between the forces of heavenly love (the putti-like children) and earthly love (the faun), but this view fails to do justice to the complex- ity of Bernini's characterizations-the mischievous animation of the children and the blissful yearning of the faun; the latter's contorted form parallels so closely that of the serpen- tine tree that the two appear to hover on the verge of an ecstatic union, anticipating the glorious transfiguration of Daphne in Bernini's work of five years later (Galleria Borghese, Rome). In his portrayal of the faun, Bernini already revealed what would become a lifelong interest in the rendering of emotional or spiritual exaltation. He infused the twisting curve that had become a compositional convention of late Mannerist sculptors with an earthy vitality and surging emotion and enriched the basic composition (which may have been his father's) with a sense of physical energy that reveals a fresh study of nature and antiquity. The virtuoso carving, which endows the surface of the sculpture with its sense of trembling life, was also learned by Bernini from his father (and from antique sculpture as well), but again he elevated it from bravura to genius-from ornament to a means of projecting the radiant spirit and pulsating life that infuse his finest works. The original perception that this unattributed sculpture was a youthful work of Bernini was inspired by its resemblance to his other early works. The identification has recently been confirmed by eighteenth-century documents placing it in the sculptor's own house at 11, Via della Mercede in Rome. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Raggio, Olga.

The bronze was created almost twenty years after this restoration- well into the Baroque period. But late Mannerist impulses continued to animate its creator, Francesco Susini, not only in his production of the Giambologna models inherited from his uncle Antonio (Giambologna's master assistant) but also in his choice of this particular figure to reproduce. The antique's contorted pose, which mandates a second point of view for a full appreciation, can in some ways be seen as a prefiguration of Giambologna's Mannerist concerns. The separately cast base, with anthropomorphic bats crouched beneath the crushing weight of the upper story, is a beautifully original creation, in its turn continuing the Giam- bologna workshop's ornament style, as do the squashed car- touches. These bear texts that provide a gloss of sentiment on the curious sexual theme. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Arts Council of Great Britain. Giambologna, Sculptor to the Medici.

Sachs in memory of Miss Edith L. Sachs, 1978.516.6 The composition of this bronze corresponds (except for its missing spear) to that of a statuette known from an engraving made about 1709 of the collection of the French sculptor Girardon. An odd beveling of the engraved statuette's base, precisely like that of the self-base of our piece, suggests that ours may be the very bronze from Girardon's collection. The presence of Cerberus in this composition confirms the identification as Pluto of another bronze already owned by the Museum (25.142.10). In that version, formerly in the French royal collections, the contemplative standing figure ap- pears without his three-headed canine companion. That ex- ample, probably dating from the late sixteenth century, is cast with a four-square base, establishing a viewpoint that compels one to perceive the figure as an abruptly contorted spiral; the pose is apparently derived from a composition of about 1526 by Rosso Fiorentino (Musee Historique des Tissus, Lyons). The later dating of the newly acquired bronze is sup- ported not only by its facture, but by the manner in which the entire composition has been altered by the changed configura- tion of its base. The bevel creates a subtly different point of view, and the counterpoising of Cerberus on the right and a rock formation on the left establishes a strongly open frontal plane. All collaborate to unwind the Mannerist pose of the solitary Pluto and give the later composition an unmistakable resemblance to the gravely ponderous Farnese Hercules (Mu- 31</page><page sequence="3">chardon: P.

Purchase, C. Michael Paul Gift, 1978.3 This bust of an Englishman, carved in Rome by Verschaffelt, a Flemish pupil of the French sculptor Edme Bouchardon, ex- emplifies not only the confluence of nationalities that marked mid-eighteenth-century Rome (Mecca of the Grand Tour), but also the intellectual ferment and melange of stylistic elements that characterized the period. The melting brilliance with which the coiffure is carved is thoroughly Rococo, but its asymmetry (echoing that of the casually rumpled open collar and identifying the sitter's hair as his own rather than a peruke) anticipates the Romanticism of a later era. At the same time, the sculptor's concern with expres- sion and the naturalistic rendering of personality and the sitter's wary intelligence, expressed in the grave and piercing gaze that emerges from his heavy features, are accurate reflections of Enlightenment Rationalism. Finally, the chaste containment of these bravura effects within simply outlined and broadly massed forms foreshadows the thoroughly classicizing work of Verschaffelt's later career and holds the disparate elements of the present piece together in a single, stunningly successful work of art.

A log of his busts, begun by George Vertue in 1732 and continued until 1744, lists a bust of "Dr. Bernard, Bp Rapho," as well as a "Son of Mr. Bernard." The fate of the former bust is not known, but our bust is securely identifiable with the latter. William Barnard was consecrated Bishop of Raphoe in Northern Ireland in 1744, succeeded to the bishop- ric of Derry in 1746-47, and died in 1768. The names of two sons, both clergymen, are recorded, but that of John Barnard is not. The boy is fashionably outfitted in Hussar costume, but there is a grave and wasted aspect to his intelligent features. Conceivably Rysbrack was asked to perpetuate the memory of a beloved child who died at about the age of eight. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Vertue, George. Vertue Note Books III.

One of several eighteenth-century French terracottas the Museum has acquired in recent years, this bust is presumably a model for a marble. The medium responds particularly well to Julien's in- terest in textural contrasts, especially occasioned here by the girl's picturesque coiffure with plaited hair that loops up from under a softly draped veil, twists around the floral crown, and then unravels delicately over the cloth. The subject recollects the sculptor's period of study in Rome, that requisite apprenticeship for French artists of the time, meant to inculcate in them the lessons of antiquity. How- ever, the particular lesson Julien has chosen to absorb reflects less the spirit of ancient Rome than it does French taste of the Louis XVI period, with its elevation of the sweetly natural and its espousal of a gentle, sentimental eroticism, clothed in the garments of chaste modesty.

From detailed records kept by the officials of Napoleon and Louis XVIII, we are able to reconstruct its vicissitudes rather exactly. The wave of adulatory responses to Napoleon's victory at Austerlitz included a much-praised terracotta model by Boizot. It was cast in bronze by the great founder Thomire. First exhibited in 1806, it ultimately became imperial property. The subject was an allegory of Napoleon at Austerlitz, "guided by Minerva and hymned by the goddess of a hundred voices." One of the inscriptions indicates that the bewigged hero in our bronze is meant to be the Marechal de Villars, who won the battle of Denain for Louis XIV in 1712. He is guided by a girlish figure who could easily enough be Minerva and trum- peted by Fame. Further descriptions of the Austerlitz group ("The Emperor raised on a hillock, having at his feet flags captured from the enemy at Austerlitz") led inescapably to the conclusion that Boizot's basic composition had been reused. In fact, there is a loose fit and evidence of rechasing along the diagonal line where the torso joins the hero's tunic. The Boizot-Thomire Napoleon had held an olive branch and a 33</page><page sequence="5">figure of Victory, whereas our field marshal holds in his left hand a baton decorated with Bourbon fleurs-de-lis. This arm too may be moved. The physical suggestions of changes wrought within the group are confirmed by the Louis XVIII documentation. Louis XVIII took over the imperial possessions upon his re- turn to the throne. An essential part of his artistic policy was to commission alterations to the works he found, suppressing Napoleonic imagery whenever possible. There was even a spe- cial budget for the purpose. Thomire himself was paid a minor sum in 1818 for the "restoration of a three-figure group in bronze representing Mr. le Marechal de Villars. Allegorical subject." The bronze thus illustrates the Bourbon Restoration operating at its most literal level. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Draper, James David.

About 1864-66. Signed. H. 15 in. (38.1 cm.). Purchase, Charles Ulrich and Josephine Bay Foundation, Inc., Gift, 1975.312.7 The model for this winsome terracotta is recognizable as Rodin's mistress and lifelong companion, Rose Beuret. The terracotta comes from the collection of Alessandro Zoubaloff, but the date of its origin is unrecorded. The youthful appear- ance of the model, however, and her guise as a follower of Bacchus, the god of the vine, suggest that this work is related to a lost Bacchante that occupied the young sculptor for more than two years and for which Rose Beuret posed. The life-size figure was broken during a move from one studio to another about 1866, and Rodin later referred to its loss with regret. Rodin was repeatedly refused entrance to the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts, thus escaping the rigid training in Neo- classicism that still dominated its curriculum in the mid-1850s. It is, therefore, not surprising that this terracotta should ap- pear so strikingly reminiscent of French eighteenth-century sculpture. In fact, it faithfully reflects the sculptor's early train- ing, first at the "Petite Ecole," where he received a thorough grounding in the traditions of French eighteenth-century art, and later in the studio of the sculptor Carrier Belleuse, where Rodin perfected the facility and deftness that characterize the modeling of the terracotta Bacchante.

Purchase, Mr. and Mrs. Claus von Biilow Gift, 1977.338 The Schoolgirl (L' Ecoliere) is among the best-documented and most thoroughly studied of Degas's sculptures. One of the few for which preparatory drawings exist (Paris, Bibliotheque Na- tionale Dc 327d reserve, Carnet 2, published by Theodore Reff, The Art Quarterly, p. 284, figs. 13-15), the original wax statuette is known to have been modeled about 1881. This bronze is the eleventh of a series of twenty that was cast in 1956 after the original wax by the Paris founder A. A. Hebrard. According to John Rewald (Degas: Sculpture), in the 1920s five bronzes were cast from the same model for Degas's heirs. The figure is a deceptively straightforward representation of a girl who displays the awkward charm of early adolescence. But the Schoolgirl also reveals Degas's lifelong concern with representing the effects of certain motions and tensions on the feminine anatomy and with exploring their expressive quali- ties. Here he has captured admirably the half-shy, half-saucy gait of a young French schoolgirl of the period. 34</page><page sequence="6">The figure augments the Museum's extensive collection of Degas bronzes, which now lacks only two of the subjects that were cast from wax and plaster sculptures found in the artist's studio at the time of his death.

Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, 1976.115.14 Charles Lebrun (1619-1690), premier peintre of Louis XIV, was not only the most renowned painter of his day, but the virtual dictator of all his master's artistic projects. Extraordinarily ver- satile, he could turn his hand to designing sculpture, architec- tural elements, garden schemes, and a wide range of decora- tive objects from tapestries to lock plates. In 1663 he was ap- pointed to supervise the Savonnerie manufactory, a carpet- weaving works established under Henri IV, named for an abandoned soap factory on the western outskirts of Paris that was used as a workshop. The original objective in founding the manufactory was to promote a favorable balance of trade, ex- cluding the import of carpets from Turkey, Persia, and Egypt, and encouraging a native industry to turn out a comparable product. The venture benefited largely from royal patronage in the early years of Louis XIV's reign. Shortly after Lebrun was put in charge of the manufactory, thirteen Savonnerie carpets were ordered for the Galerie d'Apollon of the Louvre, their ornament repeating the decoration of the room's ceiling, also designed by Lebrun. This was followed by a much larger order for the Grande Galerie du Bord de l'Eau, which joined the Louvre and the Tuileries (the Louvre Museum's French School paintings are presently exhibited in this gallery, which is over 480 yards long). Altogether ninety-three carpets were ordered (only ninety-two of which were woven) to cover this vast space; they were described in a 1681 inventory of Louis XIV's possessions. Lebrun started work on the designs in 1665, and the first carpets were put on the looms in 1668. All the carpets are roughly thirty feet in length; the widths vary between ten and sixteen feet. The present carpet, one of the finest ones surviving from the series, belongs among the narrow examples. It was delivered for the king's use on Octo- ber 23, 1680, and was the seventy-third of the ninety-two carpets in the series to be woven. Louis XIV abandoned the Louvre for Versailles in 1678, so it is unlikely that all the car- pets were ever laid out on the floor of the Grande Galerie. The decoration of all these carpets was organized in three main divisions, a large central compartment and two smaller reserves at the ends, which might be filled with landscapes (as in the case of this carpet) or simulated bas-reliefs often repre- senting allegorical figures. Within this rather rigid form, great variety was introduced into the decoration of the individual carpets or pairs of carpets (for the same pattern was frequently woven twice). The present example, resplendent in its fresh colors, centers on a blue-and-gold rosette flanked by plumed helmets and heads of Mercury. The three fleurs-de-lis of France set into blue orbs surmounted by royal crowns occur at the two ends of the central cartouche, flanked by floral gar- lands and rinceaux on a dark brown (fond brun) ground. The carpet is now shown on the floor of the room from the Hotel de Varengeville in the Wrightsman Galleries. An- other carpet from the same series (58. 75. 129), the gift of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, is shown in the adjoining Palais Paar Room, and altogether well over half of the original ninety-two carpets recorded in the inventory of 1681 have been identified (some in fragmentary condition), mainly in public collections in France and in the United States.

The baron in- corporated the boiserie, with other disparate elements, in the first floor of his Paris residence, the H6tel Lauzun, no. 17, C: '^ Quai d'Anjou on the north bank of the Ile St. Louis. A notable example of French mid-seventeenth-century architecture, the .: H6tel Lauzun was built for the entrepreneur Charles Gruyn tI'~ ~ des Bordes from plans of the architect Louis Le Vau, between ~.P ~ 1650 and 1657. The Louis XVI-style boiserie, which dates about 1770, was introduced into the decor of the library about 1860 as part of Baron Pichon's interior remodeling of the h6tel. Following a stricter aesthetic, the baron's grandson, Baron Louis Pichon, who acquired the h6tel in 1905, dis- mantled and sold the library's paneling in an attempt to re- store the original seventeenth-century appearance of the room. The ten panels that form the principal ornament of the room are carved at the top with swags, flower baskets, foliate motifs, and cartouches, and at their lower extremities with vases, cornucopias, arabesques, and a variety of fruit and vr into pieces of flower forms. Similar carvings occur on each pair of panels, so ize mounts. For that five distinct motifs appear in the carved ornament of the to the Chinese room (the slight variations in the carving of each pair of panels s because it was are due to the carver's free interpretation of an unknown !r with its gold architect's design; only nine of the panels are original; the f the mounts. tenth, to the left of the entrance, is a modern copy of the panel d wood, carved on the right).

The flooring consists of eighteenth-century parquet de Versailles; the plaster corer and ceiling rosettes are, as might be expected, modern. The three grisaille overdoor paintings on canvas, which depict groups of children emblematic of Spring, Summer, and ',: ~ Winter, come from another source and were not originally set *-_. :' above the three double doors. They are in the style of the artist Piat-Joseph Sauvage (1744-1818), who painted three similar subjects of the Seasons (complemented by a fourth painting symbolic of Autumn) for Marie-Antoinette's laiterie at Ram- bouillet about 1787. When Baron Pichon acquired the woodwork elements for ^: v; . his library, he had them stripped of their original paint down ;:.: i to the bare oak, which was then darkly stained, in keeping with r ;jl J. l1. tthe nineteenth-century penchant for somber colors. Since the original scheme was lost, it was decided to paint the carved relief in a variety of naturalistic colors in polychrome against a warm gray ground, the moldings and pilasters picked out in a shade of burnt sienna. This restoration was carried out in Paris in 1976. The colors used reflect those found in watercolor drawings by Pierre Ranson (1736-1786) for Louis XV- and Louis XVI-style wall decoration, as well as hand-colored orna- mental etchings of the mid-1770s. The use of a range of ?\ _^ l ~ naturalistic color for carved boiseries was far from common in the eighteenth century, and only a few such Louis XV and Louis XVI period rooms are known to exist. -~RIS ~ The Museum's collection of French furniture inlaid with cm.), W. 26 ft.

Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, 1977.102.5, 6 Attributes of hunting, usually associated with masculine pas- times, decorate this splendid pair of andirons; apart from the figures of the boar and stag, dead birds and animals are de- picted in the bas-reliefs set into each plinth; other three- dimensional examples of dead game are piled on top of both outstretched arms. Surprisingly enough, the earliest and best- known casting of this model was made for a woman, Louis XV's last mistress, Madame du Barry. The pair that belonged to the king's mistress, now in the Louvre, Paris, was delivered for her apartment at the Chateau de Fontainebleau in October 1772 by Quentin-Claude Pitoin, the principal supplier of such decorative objects for the royal household. The figure of the boar on the left-hand andiron derives from a life-size Roman marble copy of a third-century Greek original in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The andiron figure was probably closely modeled after an early seventeenth- century Italian reduction of this marble copy. In addition to the present example, another pair of gilt- bronze andirons from the same model, also attributed to Pitoin, is in the Palais de Compiegne, a third is in the Rijks- museum, Amsterdam, and a number of nineteenth-century reproductions are known.

Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, 1977.1.13 This subdued but opulent late Louis XVI-style desk is signed above the right rear leg by Adam Weisweiler, a cabinetmaker born in Neuwied on the Rhine, near Koblenz. Approximately a third of the cabinetmakers working in Paris in the late eigh- teenth century were born in Germany (where the technique of cabinetmaking was more highly developed than in France) or in the Netherlands. The gilt-bronze stiles on the front corners of this desk take the form of female term figures supporting baskets of flowers. Similar gilt-bronze supports occur on a table, also signed by Weisweiler, supplied by the marchand-mercier Dominique Da- guerre in 1784 for Marie-Antoinette, now in the Louvre, Paris. *lI It may have been Daguerre who provided Weisweiler with Japanese black lacquer panels when he commissioned this desk and its companion pieces. At the same time he might have ordered gilt-bronze mounts for the set from the well-known bronze chaser and gilder Pierre Gouthiere. By coordinating the activities of the various skilled workmen contributing to the creation of such decorative objects, he was carrying out the functions of an eighteenth-century marchand-mercier.

JP SILVER AND CERAMICS Attributed to BERNARD PALISSY French. 1510-1590 DISH: DIANA AND THE STAG Paris. Last third of 18th century. Earthenware decorated with tinted lead glazes. Diam. 19 3/4 in. (50.2 cm.). Bequest of R. Thornton Wilson, in memory of his wife, Florence Ellsworth Wilson, 1977.216.4 Before he moved to Paris from Saintes sometime between 1564 and 1566, Bernard Palissy had not only discovered by trial and error the formula for white tin glaze, already long 37</page><page sequence="9">known in Italy and south Germany, but had made a significant original contribution to the progress of ceramic art. This was the ability to produce, at a single firing, a wider range of col- ored lead glazes than was then known in France and in subtler, more painterly hues than those used by the contemporary German Hafner. The "rustic" pieces-large dishes and basins decorated in relief with leaves and plants and water and ripar- ian creatures modeled from life, and for which Palissy was already quite celebrated-no doubt continued after he set up a workshop in Paris. The large dishes modeled in relief with figure subjects cannot be connected with him by any documen- tary evidence, but the use of a molding technique by which duplicates could be made and a similar range of colors suggest at least they were made in his atelier or with his collaboration. They show a strong affinity with the decorative motifs and mythological subject matter of the Fontainebleau School and surely are to be dated from after his arrival in Paris. Only two other examples of this design are known. It was inspired by the "Diana of Anet," a marble fountain sculpture made about 1559 for the courtyard of the Chateau d'Anet, possibly by Jean Goujon.

JMcND SIDEBOARD DISH: THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS Dutch or German, for the English market. About 1660-80. Silver. W. 41 in. (104.1 cm.). Purchase, Mr. and Mrs. Claus von Bulow Gift, 1979.98 This is a rare survivor from the period of extravagant use of silver among royalty and the nobility for furnishings and other articles intended purely for display. Until 1921 this dish was in the strong room at Clumber, seat of the Dukes of Newcastle- under-Lyne, descended from Henry, second duke, whose arms appear on the plaque in the upper border. He inherited the title in 1768. He and his wife were each sole heir to prop- erty that had belonged to forebears prominent at the time of the Restoration and during the reign of William III. The arms no doubt replace those of the original owner, so that it is not possible to know which of the second duke's illustrious (and lucky) forebears first owned the dish, or whether it was even a royal gift. The dish is unmarked, as much work of the period made by immigrant embossers is. Despite protests from the goldsmiths' company, which refused to mark this work, foreign goldsmiths with special skills flourished under the protection of the king, Charles II. The decoration is based on an engraving by Sadeler, 1589, after a painting by Hans Von Aachen, EX COLL.: The Dukes of Newcastle; Lord Gort, V. C. Model by JOHANN FRIEDRICH EBERLEIN, 1735 OWL WITH DEAD PIGEON German (Meissen). About 1735. Hard-paste porcelain. H. 20 7/16 in. (52 cm.). Bequest of R. Thornton Wilson, in memory of his wife, Florence Ellsworth Wilson, 1977.216.9 When Eberlein came to Meissen in 1735, the factory was still actively engaged in producing bird and animal sculptures. Not on the same scale as the huge white figures made in the early 1730s, these pieces were smaller, naturalistically colored, and more sympathetic to the medium. Eberlein, who was thirty- nine at the time and clearly experienced, completed several models in his first year, including this one, of which the only other known example is in the state art collections of Dresden. Eberlein's compatibility with J. J. Kaendler, to whom he was assistant, is apparent in models they both contributed a few years later to the Swan Service, made for Count Briihl. Al- though Eberlein's work is often considered to be scarcely dif- ferent from Kaendler's, his models are distinguishable by a certain softness, a less aggressive character than those of Kaendler. CLC PAIR OF TUREENS Chinese, made for the continental market. 1750-60. Hard- paste porcelain. L. 11 11/16 in. (29.8 cm.), H. 9 3/4 in. (24.7 cm.). Purchase, Winfield Foundation Gift Fund, 1976.90.1,2 A number of influences are implied in the appearance of these tureens (one illustrated). Their shape evokes the Baroque sculptural tablewares (themselves often derived from exam- ples in silver) produced at Meissen in the late 1730s. The deco- ration, a highly organized arrangement of strapwork, scrolls, and leafy ornament, recalls the formal stylized laub- und ban- delwerk of Viennese porcelain of the Du Paquier period (1718- 44) and its freer modifications by independent porcelain deco- rators (hausmaler). The tureens are part of a larger group of export porcelains that have in common the same palette of bright clear colors, the same unusual mixed silver and ceramic forms, and similar but nonrepeating decoration. Included in 38 Raphael 1588. JMcND</page><page sequence="10">the group are a tureen and stand, the tureen with handles of the same design as on the Museum's pair; a tazza; a beaker; and a covered jar or caddy. There are in addition several ornamental pieces from a table service-including two wine coolers, again with handles of the same design-all painted with a bishop's coat of arms. Perhaps because of the massive silver- oriented forms and the early style of decoration, the service has traditionally been attributed to the short-lived Vezzi fac- tory in Venice (1720-27). Founded with the technical assis- tance of C. C. Hunger, who had defected from Vienna, Vezzi's stylistic compatibility with the Du Paquier factory is intelligi- ble; but whether Vezzi did indeed ever produce this armorial service is unclear, as all the pieces appear to be of Chinese manufacture, ranging in date from the mid-eighteenth cen- tury to about 1810. If the entire group of export porcelains exemplified by our tureens is in fact homogeneous as to origin, a clue to that origin may be sought in the coat of arms. Although not cer- tainly identified, it incorporates shields of the Portuguese fam- ilies of Lima, Fonseca, and (possibly) Tavares. Thus another element is added to the already diverse character of these pieces. Bearing in mind that every example of China trade porcelain must have been copied exactly from a model (whether drawn or three-dimensional), one must assume the existence of one for these tureens. Where in Europe would such a model have originated? Embodying stylistic overtones from Meissen and Vienna of the 1730s, a tentative link with Vezzi of still earlier date, a certain one with export porcelains of the second half of the eighteenth century, and a Portuguese connection implied by the armorial, such a model is, not sur- prisingly, elusive. Other factors must also be considered: each model appears to be unique in shape and decoration, an ex- ceptional occurrence in China trade porcelain, which was predicated on repetition. Further, the palette is entirely unre- lated to that commonly seen in conjunction with laub- und bandelwerk ornament, but is consistent with that occurring on export porcelains made for the Portuguese market after about 1760. A tentative explanation of these pieces is that they are the result of a specific, probably Portuguese, commission, and that their idiosyncrasies are due to an idiomatic interpretation of styles at a time and place rather removed from their first flowering. Such a suggestion still leaves unresolved many com- plexities of trade, provenance, and diffusion of style that make these tureens among the most interesting examples of China trade porcelain. CLC TUREEN French (Niderviller). 1770-74. Faience (tin-glazed earthenware). H. 9 7/8 in. (25.1 cm.), W. 15 in. (38.1 cm.), D. 8 1/2 in. (21.6 cm.). Charles E. Sampson Memorial Fund, 1977.378ab It is rare to find an accomplished expression of Neoclassicism in faience, a medium that lent itself to the flowing forms of Rococo. It is more than unusual to find a royal portrait on a piece of earthenware in the late eighteenth century, when por- celain was considered the prestige ceramic. Yet here we have medallion portraits of Louis XV on a faience vessel composed of a selection of forms and ornaments from the classical vocab- ulary. Miniaturist painting in pink accented with green and a fine gray clay identify this unmarked piece as a product of Niderviller. The factory was bought in 1770 by the Comte de Custine, a politically powerful general who was to serve in the American Revolution and distinguish himself at Yorktown. The tureen can be precisely dated, as Custine introduced the new classical style but soon devoted his attentions to develop- ing a porcelain branch to his enterprise. Furthermore, Louis XV died in 1774, and no astute promoter would emblazon the image of the previous ruler on so important a showpiece. PH-S PUNCH BOWL French (Sevres). About 1772. Soft-paste porcelain. Diam. 13 1/4 in. (33.7 cm.). Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, 1976.155.162 In September 1772 Louis-Edouard-Rene, Prince de Rohan, purchased from the Sevres manufactory a 368-piece dessert 39</page><page sequence="11">service. Made during 1771 and 1772 and painted with his monogram, LPR, in two shades of gold on a ground color of brilliant turquoise blue (bleu celeste), the Rohan service is one of the dozen and more large table services produced at Sevres in the eighteenth century. The principal decoration, vignettes of exotic birds, was the work of several factory artists, chiefly Francois-Joseph Aloncle (working 1758-81) and Etienne Evans (working 1752-1806). The vignettes have been painted with a liveliness of color and setting that was characteristic of the Sevres decorators and that was quite independent of the ornithological correctness inspired by the contemporary publi- cation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle. CLC JEAN-BAPTISTE-CLAUDE ODIOT French. 1763-1850. Master 1785 CRUET Paris. About 1817. Silver gilt and glass. H. 15 1/16 in. (38.2 cm.). Gift of Audrey Love in memory of C. Ruxton Love, Jr., 1978.524.2a-e This cruet, one of a pair from a service purchased from Odiot in 1817 by "Mr [presumably Count Nicolas] de Demidoff," exemplifies the silversmith's move away from the current, somewhat static, decorative style to one that was boldly sculp- tural. Throughout the First Empire, Odiot made use of the accepted classical subjects and motifs, generally conceived as plaques or friezes applied to unadorned surfaces. A profusion of these appliques, combined with minor sculptural details in the modeling of spouts, handles, or finials, defines the work of the Empire silversmiths; the presence of such ornamentation was in large part due to the influence of Napoleon's designers Charles Percier and P. F. L. Fontaine. This in itself may be said to have been the end growth of Neoclassicism in which plain surfaces, moldings, and decorative details were rhythmically and harmoniously ordered and disposed: at its most academic, a piece of Empire silver became simply a vehicle for the ap- plied catch phrases of the prevailing decorative vocabulary. In the Demidov service this essentially two-dimensional approach yielded to one in which small-scale sculpture played a dominant role. The use of figures in the round in the design of silver tablewares was hardly new: in 1750-51 Antoine- Sebastien Durand executed a charming mustard pot modeled as a barrel pushed along by a cherub; Brazilian infants dis- ported themselves around saltcellars by Francois-Thomas Ger- main (1757-58); and tureens by Germain and by Edme-Pierre Balzac (1756-58) were surmounted by elaborate naturalistic stag hunts. Such groups and figures were, however, subordi- nate to the overall design of the objects; with Odiot the sculp- tural figure becomes the focus of the design, as commanding by itself as it is a dramatic element in the composition of cruets, salts, and tureens. The independent character of Odiot's figures is empha- sized by his innovative method of constructing his pieces, a method that eliminated the soldering of attached elements and substituted threaded screws and nuts fitted through holes pierced in the body. His figures thus exist as self-contained and convincing sculptures. It is a measure of Odiot's skill that they are also convincing as component parts in his designs for useful tablewares.

Gift of John M. Schiff, 1977.437.1-5 When the first archaeological excavators broke into the buried lower stories of classical Roman palaces in the late fifteenth century, they found interior walls decorated in a strange and fantastic way. Because the rooms so decorated were then un- derground, they were thought of as caves (grotte), and the decorations were called grotesques. Raphael used the style for some interiors in the Vatican. Ever since, time and again, there 40 / A[ , . wes3</page><page sequence="12">have been revivals; this was certainly at least partly because nothing could be more augustly sanctioned than a style fa- vored both by the ancients and by the most admired of painters. One such revival was in France in the late seventeenth century. At that time, Jean Berain (1640-1711) was designer to the king, and gaiety and lightness in the decorative arts were beginning to take the place of the solemn magnificence typical of the earlier years of Louis XIV's reign. Berain perfected a grotesque style all his own, designing many prints filled with insubstantial architecture, dangling trophies, and lively little figures of men, beasts, and birds, mostly engaged in light- hearted or theatrical activities. The set of Beauvais tapestries given by John M. Schiff comes from a series known for the last hundred years as the "Berain Grotesques," but they were actu- ally designed by the flower painter Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer (1634-1699); there are, indeed, far more flowers on the arbors and in the vases of the tapestries than are usual in the Berain prints. The name of the head of the manufactory, BEHAGLE, seen in the lower right corner of the Musicians, shows that the set was woven while Philippe Behagle held the position (1684-1705) or during the directorship of his widow and son (1705-11). Grotesque designs, already used for tapestries in the six- teenth century, are thoroughly appropriate for this purpose; it is much simpler to make such designs larger or smaller to fit given wall spaces than it is to adapt compositions with life-size, story-telling figures. All tapestries of this series have the same yellow ground, known in France as "Spanish tobacco," but the most frequently found borders show somewhat monotonous curling leaves and flowers. On the Schiff set, the borders are an added attraction; their brilliant colors on sparkling white grounds and very classical grotesques surrounding medallions with chinoiserie figures are markedly well drawn and imagina- tive. The Grotesques, first woven in the 1680s, were very popu- lar; some 150 individual examples exist today. The original sets were usually of six pieces; an Offering to Pan in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris may be from the same set as the five Schiff hangings. Another set of six, with the same border, is in Schloss Bruchsal, owned by the Badisches Landes- museum, Karlsruhe. The Museum has an Offering to Pan given by Mrs. Guy Fairfax Cary in 1950 (50.205); it is taller and has a more usual border, with the signature P.BE (Philippe Behagle). There are also two chairs, bequeathed by Benjamin Altman in 1913 (14.40.779,780), with tapestry upholstery woven to har- monize with wall hangings of this series. They have the initials cP, of the Swedish chancellor Carl Piper, who commissioned them in 1695. Piper's wall hangings, which had a different border, have not been identified with certainty, but the furni- ture covers to match are the earliest known examples of a manufacturing practice that was to be a mainstay of the Beauvais works for the next two hundred years.

He was not only ". . . the first to know how to arrange a garland of flowers on fabric .. ." (in the words of a contemporary, quoted by Daryl Hafter, Philippe de Lasalle: From Mise-en-carte to Industrial Design. Winterthur Portfolio 12. University Press of Virginia, 1977, p. 137), he was also an ingenious inventor who was awarded the cordon of St. Michel for "his useful discoveries ... the fruit of zeal and application," one of which enlarged the capacities of the drawloom so that six-foot-high repeats were possible. The small number of doc- umented examples surviving today from his hand include the woven portrait of Catherine the Great and a handsome design for wall paneling called Les Perdrix, both in the Museum's collections (41.78, 50.8a-c). The noble silk illustrated here, with its tasseled swags and rich bouquets, is said to have been designed by Philippe de la Salle for Stanislas Leszczynski (1677-1766), king of Poland and father-in-law of Louis XV, for his palace at Nancy. It is certainly typical of la Salle's spa- cious, sumptuous designs realized, with well-disguised econ- omy, in brocaded silks and chenille on a cannele ground rather than in the expensive compound weaves heavy with silver and gold yarns theretofore the status silks of the age.

Purchase, Mr. and Mrs. Claus von Billow Gift, 1978.404.1-18 The Four Continents was a favorite subject for the arts from 41</page><page sequence="13">the discovery of America until the end of the eighteenth cen- tury, by which time it was clear that Australia was a fifth. The continents were usually represented as women with attributes that became standardized: among other characteristics, America wore feathers, Asia had the trappings of enormous wealth, Africa was black, and Europe was accompanied by a horse, the noblest of animals, and by symbols of the arts and sciences. The tapestries recently given to the Museum preserve enough of the earlier ideas to identify the personifications, but the iconography is extraordinarily original. America (illustrated) wears her feathers and carries her bow, but she is supported by Liberty, whose well-known cap tops the staff of the Stars and Stripes. On her behalf, France, brandishing a thunderbolt and with the Bourbon fleurs-de-lis on her shield, swoops down upon a cowering Britannia; over- thrown cannon lie useless on the ground, and two leopards (the predecessors of the British lion) writhe in impotent fury. A winged Victory, or perhaps Fame, fastens a medallion with a bust of George Washington to a Tuscan column; the simplicity of the order indicates the unsophisticated virtues of the young republic and its hero. Peace and Plenty recline on the clouds. The other continents also illustrate original ideas. Asia has Chinese and Turkish treasures among her gold and jewels. A scene in the background of Africa shows Minerva helping Time to uncover a sphinx; that is to say, learning has begun in time to reveal the secrets of ancient Egypt. The countries of Europe that had recognized the United States are represented by coats of arms on the fourth tapestry. The sofa covers, two continents to each piece, stress the benefits of trade across the oceans, with human figures on the backs and suitable animals on the seats. Every panel is different on the chairs, with three backs and three seats allotted to each continent. The designs of the hangings are found, somewhat re- duced, on a set at Osterley Park, near London. But there is only one recorded weaving of the wall panels and the furni- ture covers, made for the king of France from 1790 to 1791. It has been suggested that Louis XVI intended to give that set to George Washington, but was prevented from so doing by the development of the French Revolution. It was soon used by the new government as partial payment of a debt. Many sets of wall hangings and matching upholstery were made at Beauvais, but none as rich and complete as this one has survived undivided. Beauvais, though called "royal," was a commercial enterprise; its products had to sell. They were thus intended primarily to please the buyers and are frequently as well made and more agreeable than the prestigious weavings of the Gobelins. The Museum has a wide range of Beauvais tapestries, both hangings and furniture covers, from the seventeenth century to this set, the last of the really great series, the swan song of the manufactory in its golden days.
