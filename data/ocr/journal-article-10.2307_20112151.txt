<plain_text><page sequence="1">29 RITES OF PASSAGE: NEW ZEALAND POETRY IN TRANSITION 1985-1987 PART I: JANUARY 1985 - JUNE 1986 Peter Alcock The title assumes these three years can be seen as a time of major transition in New Zealand poetry. The three-part scenario of Van Gennep's rites-de-passage (before, during and after some social transformation) can be not so loosely related to major anthologies at the beginning and end of the triennium, also to the publication of poets and of periodical material. That intervening arbitrary time-slash at eighteen months can, relevantly, demonstrate the nervous tensionAuspense' technique so representative of con temporary writing, and may promote that diff?rence that 'extends the domain and the play of signification' at least until the next issue of JNZL. Which is to allege that through January 1985 to June 1986 the outstanding events in New Zealand poetry were the appearance of the long-awaited new Penguin Book of New Zealand Verse, edited by Ian Wedde and Harvey McQueen, of the latest slim immaculate volume from Allen Curnow, The Loop in Lone Kauri Road, and (in October 1985) of the fourth and final issue of the little magazine And (1983-85). In these events may be seen writ plain a changing of the guard in local poetry. This Penguin Book's eminent precursor (1960) had the same title, was edited solo by Allen Curnow, included his major 50-page critical 'Introduction' plus, with anthropologist Roger Oppenheim, 10 pages on 'the Maori tradition' and, partly from the same pair, 9 further pages of traditional Maori chant and other waiata. Also included were notes on 'Some New Zealand Words and Names' (largely Maori) and 19 pages of extremely useful 'Notes on the Poets', being extensive compact bio- and bibliographies. It was a typical Penguin, of 340 pages, 18 by 11 by almost 2 centimetres. Both content and 'Introduction' rapidly assumed canonical status. The new book has 575 pages, is almost 20 by 13 by 3 centimetres, in weight increased fourfold to almost 800 grams. It has a 29 page 'Introduction' (by Wedde solo), 8 pages on 'The Maori tradition' by Margaret Orbell, 'Notes' (16 pages) on the Maori language content, and a 12 page 'Select Bibliography' of the authors. That the old cost five bob and the new NZ$15.95 reflects the times. The old had a matt olive cover-pattern rumoured to show fern spores ? doubtless awaiting 'a mar vellous year'. The new has a gleaming colour shot of a dull day at coastal</page><page sequence="2">30 railway sidings (captioned 'Railway, Kaikoura'), with a wintry sea and cloud, the foreground stony, railway tracks, half a shabby red wooden guards van. The back cover adds a vignette of 'a rusting manual points lever with some red tinged stones at the base. It's a cover which delivers plenty of information: the departure of the old guards van, a main line replaced by a diversity of tracks, the disclosure of a new uneasy landscape . . .'.1 In his 'Introduction' Wedde writes: 'What we have done here ... is to condense and redefine the period dealt with by Allen Curnow, and to give as generous a selection as possible of the poetry written since then'.2 It's hardly that simple. Back in September 1984 Wedde, speaking both for himself and co-editor McQueen, had said of the project: 'We both felt it was time to see if we couldn't broaden the scope imposed by Allen Curnow's very rigorous selections .... We agreed that a core tradition needed to be respected, but that there was no m?tropole text . . ., that a separate post-sixties anthology would soon be necessary' [see JNZL 6]; they agreed also on the importance of the perceived rights of women and Maori. He writes of a fifties debate between 'universal' and 'local' (elaborated as, between 'prescriptive/text-centric' and 'descriptive/contextual'), that in his anthology 'Curnow had very cleverly switched the tracks' (hence the back cover?) ? the Introduction strenuously promotes the second alternatives.3 In the year of publication Wedde writes of such arguments: 'These result in the book opening with about thirty pages in Maori, with translations, of nga moteatea, traditional song-poetry. The stertorous mimicry of most nineteenth century colonial poetry has largely been replaced by a few less self-conscious "popular" pieces ? such samples continue throughout. Also continued up to the present are compositions in Maori (about twenty per cent of the book, including translations) whose oral and "folk" qualities are admitted on their own terms. Maori poets who write in English are read in contexts that seem, suddenly, "right".'4 Taking a statistical approach one New Zealand reviewer writes: 'Curnow in 1960 included 36 poets plus translations of seven poems in Maori, making 226 pages of poems in a book of 340 pages (about a third of the book consisted of editorial apparatus) .... Wedde and McQueen include the work of 107 poets and 462 pages of poems in a book of 575 pages. The Wedde/McQueen collection thus has more poets, more poems, and more pages than any previous anthology, but the really egregious figure is the number of poets included, more than twice that of previous anthologies.5 One further aspect of Wedde and McQueen's approach involves the contrast 'hieratic'/'demotic': 'We need the hieratic depths, which need the demotic inputs of newer cultures' and 'What is called "New Zealand poetry" is thus a process, not a national condition'.6 Also 'such a book must be concerned . . . not only with its usefulness now, but in the future. It must look forward across a generation, at any rate ?</page><page sequence="3">31 across 15 years, say, to its replacement.'7 All this serves to document the range, thought, controversial nature, innovation and boldness of Wedde/McQueen's achievement. New Zealand critics Pakeha and Maori have praised and damned the book. C K Stead con cludes that 'This Penguin is in fact a perfect expression of New Zealand intel lectual life as it strikes me at the moment. There is so much that is fresh and free and lively and well-intentioned. . . . But along with that freshness there goes ... a lack of toughness or intellectual daring. . . .' Which is to put Wedde/McQueen in the liberal-cliche-mongering business. He can't accept the validity of the Maori content: 'Theirs, Wedde claims, "is the first Penguin anthology anywhere in the 'post-colonial' world to include quantities of poetry in an indigenous language." I.predict it will be the only one in which the editors offer poetry in a language they don't know!'8 Of the partial inclusion of Blanche Baughan's 'Maui's Fish' (unpublished since 1906), Peter Simpson writes: '. . . something of the impulse embodied in this poem ? bold, experimental, generous, idealistically bicultural ? also animates this new anthology. It attempts to deliver New Zealand poetry alive.' On the dialectical approach expressed in Wedde's Introduction this critic affirms: 'Wedde and McQueen have wrestled their complex and intractable material into an impressive effect of unity; by the balancing of forces in ten sion, the centre holds'.9 Among Maori, Keri Hulme rhapsodises: '. . . this book has so much rich ness, fatness, sheer power in it, that, beside it, all the former anthologies look narrow-gutted and mean'.10 Contrariwise Maori Professor S M Mead objects to Pakeha over-involvement in things Maori: 'In actual fact I have no quarrel with Margaret Orbell's choices .... What I do have trouble with is the tradi tion among some liberal minded Pakeha academics that they should know and therefore they should decide . . . .'n What Wedde and McQueen have actually done may be thought almost exactly to correspond to Les Murray's editing of the following year's New Oxford Book of Australian Verse (1986). Murray, also, has traditional abori ginal chants and contemporary ethnic pieces, and has given generous space to Australia's much richer 'non-literary' colloquial tradition. He, likewise, has a large haul of poets rather than a select (hieratic, prescriptive/textcentric?) assembly. But Murray's Introduction is four and a half pages to Wedde's twenty-nine ? and these are written with a fluidity and ease alien to Wedde's rigorous argument. Wedde's introductory rationale for the Penguin, line by line and page by page, is intellectually embattled ? perhaps to an unnecessary degree? Allen Curnow's The Loop in Lone Kauri Road: Poems 1983-1985 (Auckland/Oxford U P, 1986) is an elegant slim grey volume (10 poems, 38</page><page sequence="4">32 pages, with a Len Lye photo on the cover), a successor to the grimly titled You Will Know When You Get There (1982), but in its title-poem relating back to the memorable first and penultimate poems of Trees, Effigies, Moving Objects (1972). That latter sequence came after a baker's dozen of years of silence. It was notable for Curnow's style moving definitively, for those days, into what Roger Horrocks for a subsequent generation has christened 'the fast lanes' (see note 19 below), also for its magnetic eddying around opposing poles of art/life, mind/matter, only semantically reconciled in the pun of the title's third term. This, of course, is a dichotomy deep in the Curnovian psyche ? 'To Forget Self and AH', 'The Eye is More or Less Satisfied with Seeing' ? to go no further back. In the 1972 book the two poems entitled 'Lone Kauri Road' both resonated sunset and the valley of the shadow: 'Everything was backing away' recurs, 'An engine fell mute into the shadow of the valley/ where the shadow had been'. 1986's title-poem presents the same polarities ? art/ nature, internal/external ? 'in the same two minds' as thought of the sea/the sight of a leaf, 'Fine crystal'/'a healthy turd' (canine), the 'raw red' road/a nuclear movie, etc, and fellow joggers 'programmed/ for the once round trip . . . double/ back, pacing [themjselves' (Curnow's insistence on the actual is known, it seems there is a 'loop' in Lone Kauri Road).12 All these late Curnow poems interact. From 'On the Road to Erewhon': '. . . If it were just one of those dreams// when running gets you nowhere! This is/ the mirrored map, the Erewhon road,/ where you came from is where you're going .... You can shiver/ suddenly, for no reason at all.' All the same, loopy as it may seem, there's always in circles ineluctably a hint of eternity, not at all necessarily of frustrate recurrence. Even if the final and Keatsian phrase of the whole book is: '. . . much nearer, even pain fully, to one's sole self (part of a prose annotation), note that 'even'! There can be in the recognition of that state a sobering, comforting certainty, and that 'sole' self paradoxically unites us Pakeha all in a collectivity (others too have ancestors?). The second poem, 'Moules ? la Marini?re' relates directly to the title and concluding poem of the previous book. 'You Will Know When You Get There' was set at the end of the day; its ominous couplets processed to a man late, 'at dead low water' (the 1949 title), picking mussels off the rocks: ... A door slams, a heavy wave, a door, the sea-floor shudders. Down you go alone, so late, into the surge-black fissure. Quite absent in the new book is the fatality of that conclusion (echoing also all his deaths ? lately of fish and fishers ? since 'Spectacular Blossom'</page><page sequence="5">33 though the recurrent A big one! A big one!' of An Incorrigible Music [1979]). Now again a man picks mussels at low tide but, in the exposed rocks, '. . . this orifice entices/ wide open, gargling, warm at the lips'. Shorter-lined tercets move nimbly and at more leisure. The 'drowning' in the poem's last half is hypothetical, even jocular, a warning only. The poem delights in Curnow's marvellous gift for an exact adjustment of language and actuality: the slack of the swell drools, fills, empties, refills, your jeans are sodden to the crotch, that's wet enough, the bag's heavy enough: do you really want more mussels, old swimmer, do you need more drowning lessons? There are two wry poems of North Canterbury childhood. One, 'A Raised Voice', on his father in the pulpit, concludes: '. . . The scent my mother wears is/vera violetta. That can't be it'. The other, 'A Sight for Sore Eyes', on child hood illness, ends equally cryptically: 'My mother grows it all from seed'. We have also the Mediterranean coast (reporting from his Katherine Mansfield Fellowship time at Menton), 'Do Not Touch the Exhibits', and 'Gare SNCF Garavan'. We have again North Canterbury in 'On the Road to Erewhon', a rather more dour reference to that chapter V of Butler's Erewhon already famously cited in the Introduction to Curnow's Penguin Book, 1960. Three poems remain. 'Blind Man's Holiday' ironically considers, it seems, 'imagination' versus 'reality' in the spheres of sex, war, an emergency rush in the night to a hospital casualty department. 'Lo These Are Parts of His Ways' uses scrambled unpunctuated discontinuities of hysteria (also con spicuous in the preceding volume) dourly to consider the justice of God: '. . . playing for keeps/my playmate's one unbelievably small/particle'. 'Canto of Signs Without Wonders' is a waltz (in the mind?) in Auckland suburbia. Curnow's own words come to mind (concluding 'An Incorrigible Music', the book and the poem): There's only one book in the world, and that's the one everyone accurately misquotes. A big one! A big one!. Curnow seems to misquote more deftly than most. 'A big one! A big one!9 repeats, as always 'with somewhat of a sad perplexity9, that concern with sex, death and dual/divorced/self-reflexive 'reality' that is the arena in which he so spectacularly performs. In the first issue of this journal K O Arvidson wrote excellently of You Will Know When You Get There:</page><page sequence="6">34 The poetry, . . . while essentially hieratic, works in and through a pervasively demotic medium; its eschatology accordingly reflects something of the predominantly lapsarian scepticism of the national temper, at least so far as that has been revealed through literary sensibilities in the past sixty years or so: the poetry of Allen Curnow, the stories of Frank Sargeson, and the letters of A R D Fairburn are tonally almost homogeneous in this respect. One acknowledges the accuracy of the tone while feeling at the same time its exclusive ness. . . .13 Curnow's art, incidentally, has been always extremely visual, that being (or not) 'the real', but this most recent volume alludes noticeably to failing vision and blindness. Arvidson's perceptive comment may lead us to the third of the alleged 'outstanding events' of this survey's first eighteen months. From And (3) here is Leigh Davis, co-editor, poet, 'merchant banker', enfant terrible (b 1955) of 'the new poetry': Curnow's writing assumes or relies on the hegemony of the 'high' in its audience ? on literature as a literary hierarchy .... He main tains several key modernist tropes: the myth of the pure mind and eye and of radical perception; and the pursuit of the 'real', . . . also the particular anxiety that would expose anthropomorphism and projection, ... a concern with the act of imposing taxonomies, and with literature distrust, and its assumed existence in an ironic frame ... the necessary seriousness of these things. ... To the extent that the hegemony of this structure slips downstream so too does Curnow, he begins to look like a 1957 Chrysler.14 This last phrase has already passed into literary history (a picture captioned 'New Zealand landscape with 1957 Chrysler' features on the cover of a major new anthology, to be discussed at the very end of this two-part survey). In Landfall, March 1985, at the very start of this survey's period, Acting Editor Hugh Lauder editorialized: New Zealand poetry, in particular, is as strong and as interesting as any being written in the English speaking world. Part of the reason for our vigorous poetic culture (as Roger Garfitt described it in a recent issue of the TLS) is the continuing no-holds-barred debate about the nature of poetry and its place in the social world .... The most recent round of this debate has been sparked by the contributors to And. . . . And members have the avowed in tention of trying to create a wholesale change in our writing and critical habits .... They are the local literary representatives of a general intellectual movement in philosophy, the sciences and the arts, which seeks to re-evaluate the relationship of knowledge to theory and practice. There is much in the movement to be welcomed and within New Zealand And have injected vitality into literary studies. . . . And have attacked entrenched ways of understanding</page><page sequence="7">35 literature and the arts by means of a thoroughgoing relativism coupled with vigorous flag waving for their own point of view.15 [The And phenomenon, and its predecessors, are discussed in more detail, and from a different perspective, in Mark Williams' article 'On the Margins?', below ? Editor.] And, 98 pages, photocopied in A4 format, Auckland, began in August 1983, and Avas edited by University of Auckland English lecturer Alex Calder and Leigh Davis: 'The magazine will always be incipient. We want it to move right along. As considered now this is a finite project with four parts only' (title-page). Leigh Davis's opening editorial 'Set Up' ends with: Two aspects of change are perhaps determining. First, the readership of New Zealand literature is increasingly plural and disparate. . . . The poetry readership, in particular, is perhaps the rowdiest and speaks the most languages. . . . Reference above is made only to hegemonic essays and figures in New Zealand literature, when the act of this reference is beginning to be made to a literary scene that does not recognise these, or for whom the co-ordinates of past New Zealand literature discussion are being deleted or are already no longer in the memory .... Second (and related) ? it is now not realistic to expect the emergence of new pivotal commentators on the literature. The development of a pluralist readership probably removes this pos sibility .... Literary scenes would seem increasingly to have their best work in smaller, more rapid figures, provisional theories, maga zines, and debates .... The pyramidal or hierarchical model of the literature may still be useful, it's not clear, but what is clear is that the base of any such pyramid is becoming increasingly dis persed .... And so we bring disaster to the tired New Zealand literature that we know, releasing an endless stream of invective and battles. We withdraw from and interrupt the Unitary readership such literature requires. Last-wordism will consume the letters to the Listener. . . . We deconstruct, we grin in the dark, strewing one historical year with glowering and strange sponsorship. Islands, local, distance, orchestrating, maps, Agathis australis, cloud, I, Jerusalem, double-margin, open, big one and AUP we have for gotten how to spell.16 (Back in February 1933 Transition 22, p.128, 'herewith announces that in future the following words will be abolished from its pages: NOVEL POETRY VERSE POEM BALLAD SONNET SHORT STORY ESSAY ANTHOLOGY' [all in bold type in a single pyramidal column]; this was the magazine of Eugene Jolas, from the Hague, who was then publishing Joyce's 'Work in Progress', i.e. Finnegans Wake.) Simply, And was a particularly lively and witty post-structuralist literary free-for-all, mainly theoretical, starring, besides the editors, Wystan Curnow</page><page sequence="8">36 (English lecturer/New York-influenced avant garde art critic) and Roger Horrocks (English lecturer/ film critic, later co-editor). And (1) includes 'The Invention of New Zealand' (Horrocks on Curnow's 1960 Penguin), Alex Calder's 'Bracken's Virgin' (Poor Tom ? 'Not Understood'), Simon During's 'Towards a revision of local critical habits', John Geraets' 'The New Zealand Anthology ? initiating an archaeology'; And (2) has 'No Theory Permitted on These Premises' (Horrocks on local criticism) plus extracts from Leigh Davis' ground-breaking poem sequence Willy's Gazette; No 3 includes Davis' 'Solo Curnow' (cited above), also 'To Postulate a Ready and Understanding Reader' (Horrocks: '. . . methods developed in analysing popular culture are today being turned against high culture'); the final issue includes "Natural as only you can be": Some Readings of Contemporary NZ Poetry' (Horrocks). And didn't of course arrive ex nihilo. New beginnings can be seen clearly with an important early (also Auckland-published) magazine, primarily poetry, The Word is Freed (more simply, Freed), five issues 1969-72 (the final one being Freed at Last), edited by Alan Brunton, Murray Edmond and Russell Haley; and later with Alan Loney's ambitiously produced Parallax' a Journal of Post-modern Literature, three issues, 1982-3. Parallax (1) included Horrocks' 'An Essay About Experimental Films That Ended Up As An Essay About New Zealand': ' . . . a change [is] taking place in our thinking about art. . . . the change has been taking place at a deep level and is just starting to crack the surface.'17 C K Stead suggested 'the advent of Freed might come to be seen 'as an event of [major] symbolic significance'; and he linked with it a list of Auckland students, including Wedde, Edmond, Brunton, Kemp, Haley, who 'in the late 1960s-early 1970s' all attended the American Poetry classes of Roger Horrocks (who 'in fact contributed an article to Freed, 4').18 Stead's notable paper containing this was 'From Wystan to Carlos ? Modern and Modernism in Recent New Zealand Poetry'. It has a simple theme (Curnow's son was Wystan, from W H Auden; Wedde's Carlos, from W C Williams): the transition from 'closed' to 'open', or to 'Modernism' as 'open form' and the influence of William Carlos Williams and other, post-war, Americans on younger NZ poetry. Parallax (3) has Horrocks' criticism of this, polite but uncompromising: '. . . It is time that Stead's "open form" ceased to be'thought of as an advanced position .... [It] is smack in the middle of the road, and it's taking up so much room it blocks the fast lanes'.19 In an account of eighteen months' poetry in New Zealand, why all this space on what seems purely general literary criticism! The passing of an 'old guard' is perennial? Barthes, Foucault, Derrida were bound to lurch to the Antipodes? First, such 'professional' activity is altogether an original pheno menon here. For all the approving rumbles in TLS cited earlier by Hugh Lauder, literary discussion in Penguin Islands (apologies Anatole France)</page><page sequence="9">37 always has been amateurish, underpowered. Secondly, an immediate relation ? involving often the same people ? exists with the poets. For instance both Davis and Wedde (themselves poet?) perceive 'hierarchy' as an offence (Wedde's Penguin Introduction, Davis' 'Set Up' for And, 1). Furthermore, since Freed, the main thrust of literary innovation, for critics and writers alike, has been through poetry (Frame's 'poetic' prose, Hulme's 'fantasy' stories being possible exceptions. ? these writers are also poets). Further, it will become more apparent in the survey article for July '86-December '87 that these develop ments profoundly engage ethnic Maori and feminist poets. The whole package is such as deeply and permanently to change our poetry scene. I would say And confirmed, in a manner quite ?^predictable, the processes of decentrali sation/decolonisation perhaps initiated two decades earlier in Freed. It is now not merely Davis, in 'Set Up' (And, 1) who perceives as innovation this 'pluralist readership'. We will find also in Vincent O'Sullivan's Introduction to the new third edition of his (canonical, 'hieratic/textcentric'?) Oxford Anthology of Twentieth Century New Zealand Poetry (1987 ? see JNZL 6), approval and acceptance of: '. . . a plurality of views and styles, an unconfined possibility of voices .... What I value most about New Zealand poetry in 1986 is that its diversity quite undercuts any ground for the prescriptive'.20 Some primarily creative side-shoots of Andar? Splash (Auckland, edited by Wystan Curnow, Tony Green, Roger Horrocks, Judi Stout) in identical format (begun July '84) and the excellent Untold (begun Autumn '84), same size, more elegant and conventional typography, edited by Simon Garrett, sub sequently with Shona Smith, from Christchurch. Not since the great Caxton days of the thirties and forties, or Landfall's inception in the late forties, has any great literary thing (after those mountains!) emerged from Christchurch. Untold's deep subversion, covert/overt, is to overturn a false balance, re-affirm that North is 'down', South is 'up' (as in Maori thinking), therefore Christ church may be properly the true focus of our islands. Untold has mostly creative work, though also some substantial criticism. May 1986 saw in Auckland the first of five issues (deliberately limited, as for And) of Rambling Jack, featuring 'new poems &amp; drawings', also 'short fiction'. Many 'new poets' appear here ? Iain Sharp, Gregory O'Brien, Mich?le Leggott, John Newton, David Eggleton ? besides Stead, Smithyman, Wedde, Manhire, Smither, Murray Edmond, Cilla McQueen, etc. From small presses and publishers, also, poets 'outside the received tradi tion' are making their entrance; relatively major has been Warwick Jordan's Hard Echo Press. Conspicuously uncompromising (first titles, poetry, in 1984 were Jordan's own Razors on the Slide, and Mike Johnson's From a Woman in Mt Eden Prison), quite a number of less 'socially acceptable', seemingly more 'bloody-minded' writers are coming from this press (see below).</page><page sequence="10">38 In such space as now remains after these major concerns it may be easiest to scan some individual volumes of January '85-June '86 in very approximate seniority. Thus first comes the new Collected Poems of Ursula Bethell (1874 1945), devotedly edited and introduced by Vincent O'Sullivan for Oxford (1985). (An earlier Caxton Collected Poems, published in 1950, lacked textual editing, also important material now first published.) A Christchurch woman poet of the 1920s and '30s, a devout Anglican and spinster, Bethell is known for metaphysical and 'garden' poems, often of surprising depth and power. D'Arcy Cresswell once commented that 'New Zealand wasn't truly discovered, in fact, until Ursula Bethell, "very earnestly digging", raised her head to look at the mountains'.21 The book fills a serious gap. Perhaps for similar 'canonical' reasons should be here mentioned the Penguin anthology Celebration: an Anthology of New Zealand Writing from the Penguin New Writing Series, edited by Anthony Stones (1985). It's a round-up of our first entry (apart from KM's) on the world's great ('Commonwealth') stage, in John Lehmann's wartime series. This involved poems from Glover, Curnow, Brasch, etc, plus prose. From older contemporaries, other than Curnow, it is Kendrick Smithyman's Stories About Wooden Keyboards (AUP/OUP, 1985) that stars. In this book, 'Rereading the Maps. An Academic Exercise' seems to have pride of place. It links interestingly with the winds of change (epigraph: 'All grid co-ordinates on this sheet are in terms of false origin'); Simon Garrett's Untold 4 review of the new Penguin Anthology borrows the title 'Rereading the Maps'; and curiously there has been a small spate of actual maps literal/metaphorical on the pages of And, and Untold. Historical anecdote ? Continental or Kiwi ? and locality are still Smithyman's materials; syntactic intricacies enact the intricacies of his intellectual play with these. A difficult poet offering lasting pleasures cerebral and semantic, Smithyman, here as ever, 'improves with the years'. In rather a different category the much slimmer volume from another senior poet, Alistair Campbell, Soul Traps (Te Kotare Press, 1985), develops Campbell's regained Polynesian (Cook Islands) identity, resurgent since his involvement with Te Rauparaha's Kapiti ('Sanctuary of Spirits', 1963) but con firmed with The Dark Lord of Savaiki (1981). 'Soul traps', nooses ?n trees, stopped the newly dead from harming the living. Here twenty terse lyrics in a limited edition dedicated to his grandparents present ancestral gods and goddesses in all-too-human situations, traditional and contemporary. Sam Hunt's Approaches to Paremata (Penguin, '85) seems thin, possibly needs its numerous photographs of Sam at play. From Michael Jackson comes Going On (Mclndoe, 1985), austere lyrics from a scatter of locations ? Europe, Africa, Australia, NZ ? relating to his Katherine Mansfield Fellow ship at Menton but centering around the tragically early death of his wife.</page><page sequence="11">39 The title is from Beckett; there is a fine concluding sequence, 'Stone', 'a poem we finished together'. Brian Turner's fourth book Bones (Mclndoe, '85) is hardly as bleak as its title. He continues a faithful concern with elemental relationships, personal and especially with the natural world. Michael Harlow's Vlaminck's Tie (Auckland University Press, '85) takes its stand on Jung: 'The psyche consists essentially of images'. The book seems rather the showcase of a dandiacal fantast than one that echoes archetypal resonance. Part Two, 'Printed Matter, Doctors Freud and Jung, for Elizabeth Smither', includes prose pieces to 'Dearest E'. There are also 'Texts for Composition' with 'Graphic Scores' by local composer Kit Powell, influenced by Stockhausen. Peter Bland's The Crusoe Factor (London Magazine Editions, '85) has four historical NZ poems (the migrants' view) in Part Two. Perhaps the most limber writing of all those in this paragraph is from prolific Elizabeth Smither in what seems at least her seventh poetry volume since 1975, Professor Musgrove's Canary (Auckland UP, 1986). Brief, intellectually quirky, provocatively titled considerations of life and death are here, leavened by a sequence on the loss of her father, and a 600-line 'dare' provoked by and for Hugh Lauder, about to fly to London. She approximates a 17th Century religio-metaphysical wit; there's often an edge of contemporary eroticism, almost always the frame of a very traditional Christianity. Here she sustains admirably the achievement anticipated. Still with the not-so-much 'older' poets should be mentioned Peter Olds, a 'younger' Dunedin friend of Baxter. After Looking for Broadway (One-Eyed Press, 1985) sustains with sprightliness an almost idyllic sordor of drop-out digs and types. He has zest, cascades of imagery, responses tender and sensitive to nature, and to particular women. Theoretically a contemporary is Bob Orr but he scores also a modest profile with the 'new' poets ? to whom Olds is some kind of Dunedin 'swaggie'? Red Trees (AUP/OUP with Silverfish, '85) is very disappointing. Excellent artist Rodney Fumpston's vividly coloured pages have upon them the merest printerly ghosts at times ? like skeletons of autumn leaves ? purporting to be Orr's 'minimalist' poems. When legible the poems still seem thin. Quiet, Katherine Raine-ish, older poet Helen Shaw (b. 1913) left our scene poorer by her death in 1985. 'Her first love' (writes Riemke Ensing22) was actually stories (three volumes, one to come), and she compiled also a vital early collection of essays on Sargeson (The Puritan and the Waif, 1959), and the Letters (1971) of D'Arcy Cresswell and his Sonnets (1976) as well as Dear Lady Ginger (OUP/AUP, '83), his correspondence with Lady Ottoline Morrell. Of her eleven small books of poetry the two last appeared in 1985, both slender, fastidious, impeccably printed, Leda's Daughter (Griffin) and Time Told from a Tower (Nag's Head).</page><page sequence="12">40 Now here come some of 'the new crowd' ? the main body is still en route (JNZL 6). Perhaps first should come Hugh Lauder, an experienced English poet only here since 1978. He has become Poetry Editor for Landfall and his Over the White Wall (Caxton, 1985) not only is the first of a 'Caxton New Poetry' series but also, allegedly for the first time locally, introduces a sophis ticated, self-conscious poetry of 'political and cultural dislocations, and their impact in personal relationships'. This is 'history' quite other than that of Curnow's or Smithyman's concerns. Second in this same series (edited by Michael Harlow) is The Singing Ground (Caxton, '86) from Tony Beyer, who has had four earlier volumes issued by Trevor Reeves' Caveman Press in the 1960s but for some years has been in Canada. His is poetry that in the book's earlier section overlaps to a degree the concerns of Lauder but is more direct, more personal. There's a strong theme of life outdoors and through the whole book, despite contraries, an undeniable serenity and warm celebration of family domesticity. Beyer seems someone to watch. From Untold (Christchurch of course!) comes altogether new poet John Newton with Tales of the Angler's Eldorado (1985). The ironic title refers to a tourist's account of big-game fishing here by ? watch out! ? Zane Grey ('A big one!9). Newton's spare prosaic actualities of rural life have gritty unpretentious bite, lyric, comic, sardonic in turn ? and always a feeling for an almost 'prosaic' landscape. From the already mentioned Hard Echo Press come two volumes from another of the new names, Iain Sharp (he has one earlier, 1980, title): She is Trying to Kidnap the Blind Person and The Pierrot Variations (both 1985). Sharp's 'blind person' is, of course, himself, and 'She' his muse 'out of key with his time'. This theme runs through that book. In the next, besides 'The Iain Sharp poem', we have also his prose encounter with Epictetus in an Auckland pub, 'Jiving with Charles Brasch', and generally a sharpness (pardon!) and wit con firming one aspect of the 'new poetry' ? its decided refusal to take itself too seriously. With Laforgue, Corbi?re, such antics have 'modern' precedent. Also from Hard Echo comes Mike Johnson (his first of two earlier books, Palanquin Ropes, 1981, won an award), with Standing Wave. It is an extremely uncompromising indictment of the corruption/hypocrisy in 'normal' society, as well as fittingly minimalist lyric on the minimal life style. At times it's almost 'concrete poetry', and always stripped to the bone, monosyllabic: 'the less you want / the more you have // it's a bloody good deal'; or 'we're part of a new culture/we can't quite grasp that yet//there's nothing to hold on to'; there's also a Lawrentian lyricism. Alistair Campbell's Soul Traps is reported above. What was not there done was to align it with New Zealand's growing 'ethnic' (not merely Maori) writing. Pakeha Barry Mitcalfe (born in 1930) has been a long time maverick in Maori studies. His Look to the Land (Coromandel, 1986), attractively illustrated,</page><page sequence="13">41 contrasts briefly Maori/Pakeha immigrations, then presents the passive resistance of Te Whiti-o-Rongomai, and the sack of his Parihaka settlement in 1881. Here also must be sadly recorded Barry's death (1986). His has been a vigorous, individual, extrovert career, well ahead of most in his far-seeing commitment to matters Maori including the introduction into schools of Maori Studies, anticipating our contemporary versions. His many publications ? poetry, fiction, prose ? include his scholarly survey of Maori poetry, The Singing Word (Price Milburn for Victoria University Press, 1974). From young Maori Rosemary Kohu comes Screaming Moko/ Hinewirangi (Tauranga: Moana Press, 1986). More important, although inaccessible to Europeans for she composed only in Maori, is Tuini (Gisborne: Te Rau, 1986), Ngoi Pewhairangi's biography and collection of the extremely important waiata of Tuini Ngawai (1910-1965) of Tokomaru Bay. The unlikely presence in New Zealand of L E Scott, a Southern US negro and Vietnam draftee who ended up here after Vietnam, adds another dimension. He has in earlier publishing combined with Pakehas and Maori. He edited in 1985 King's Cross Pub Poets (Hutt Valley Community Arts Council) ? deriving not from Oz but from a Wellington outer suburbs hotel. The selection of pub readers, besides several of our 'significant' poets, includes Yugoslavs, Vietnamese and Samoans. Two points here: 'ethnic' in New Zealand is not monoculturally Maori, as opposed to white Anglo-Saxon pakeha; we already have writing in English from Polish, Yugoslav, Greek, Chinese and Italian authors. The PEN Best First Book of Poetry Award for 1985 went to Marina Makarova's For Memory (University of Hawaii, 1985). Almost no NZ relevance at all is here! But the grace both of her global nostalgias and of her technical ease make the volume 'a charmer'. Lamentably she's almost unknown locally and the book is in no local shops. The second point is that regular pub performances by locals must now be added to the glittering one-night stands of Sam Hunt. The minor King's Cross phenomenon had been preceded back in Auckland in 1980, when regular 'Poetry Live' Tuesday evenings began at the Globe Tavern; later they moved to Ponsonby's Glue Pot. From indefatigable Hard Echo Press came in 1985 select recordings, The Globe Tapes, 2 volumes (i.e. texts with cassettes), edited by Rosemary Menzies (latterly principal organiser), Mike Johnson and Michael Morrissey. Forty-two were selected from the throng of locals and visitors, including Stead, Wedde, Tuwhare, Alistair and Meg Campbell, Jan Kemp, Barry Mitcalfe and all ('. . . and the long time Mayor of Auckland, Sir Dove Myer Robinson'). Apart from traditionally in accessible broadcasting archives, recordings of poets reading have been negligible here. Back in 1974 Jan Kemp, Alan Smythe and Jonathan Lamb using the label 'Waiata Recordings, Auckland' collected thirty-nine voices (including Mason, Fairburn, Brasch) on 'New Zealand Poets Read their Work'</page><page sequence="14">42 (two twelve-inch LPs). There have been sporadic forays from Baxter, Hunt, Glover, and two Kiwi LPs of Tuwhare. [And see Notes on the Stout Centre's Oral Archive, below ? Editor.] The anthology scene also (apart from those already mentioned) has been characterised by community groups, often regional (Hawkes Bay, Rotorua, Dannevirke, North Shore and so on) besides Auckland's annual Titirangi Poets (5th/6th volumes). A Northland collection, When Women Write in Northland (Whangarei Community Arts Council, 1985), may serve properly to stress the continuing involvement in publishing by feminist groups such as Spiral Collective. One anthology demands particular attention. Countless Signs: the New Zealand Landscape in Literature (Reed Methuen, 1986) has been edited by Trudie NcNaughton. This is a large and handsome gathering of verse and prose from all over New Zealand publishing since that began. The book is imaginatively organised, thoroughly indexed by place and author, includes excellent biographical Notes with a relevant bibliography, and has a modest but perceptive, very knowledgeable Introduction. And the theme itself is, self evidently, fundamental to all our art, Maori and European alike. Now, at long last, comes Talking About Ourselves: Twelve New Zealand Poets in Conversation (Mallinson Rendel, 1986), most capably edited by Harry Ricketts. This is not, perhaps, everybody's twelve ? should it have been ten, thirteen, twenty? But although he must stay with 'proven' names there's enough to provide a really provocative bran-tub/ lucky dip of comments of every kind on their own, and on general aspects of our, poetry from major participants speaking pithily, directly, freely. That such a compilation of obviously durable material should be patently a viable commercial venture is an immense tribute to the publisher, to the editor, and to ourselves, as yet another benchmark in that unending process of continuing maturing and achievement in a society still so small and young.
