<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RECENT JOURNEY INTO THE ZONE OF ZERO: THE EXAMPLE OF BECKETT AND HIS DESPAIR OF LITERATURE Nathan A. Scott, Jr. In a brief passage that has since become one of the famous lessons on modern literature, the French critic and early editor of the Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, Jacques Riviére, many years ago remarked: If, in the seventeenth century, it had occurred to anyone to ask Moliere or Racine why he wrote, neither would probably have found any other answer than this: "To entertain cultured peo ple." Only with Romanticism did the literary act begin to be thought of as a sort of attempt to reach the absolute, and the literary product as a revelation. At that moment literature garnered the heritage of religion and organized itself upon the model of what it replaced: the writer became a priest; all his gestures tended toward one thing only—the introduction of the "divine presence" into that eucharistic host which the work of art became. All the literature of the nineteenth century is a vast incantation toward the miracle. Now is was undoubtedly the French tradition of the nine teenth century that was at the center of Riviére's attention when he made this statement, and it may at first strike us as strange that this should have been so. For it is the German intelligence that is commonly supposed to have a kind of racial monopoly on the headier forms of metaphysical ad venturism; whereas, it is the qualities of clarity and lucidity and logicality that it is our habit to regard as characteristically French. But these are clichés that are quickly crumbled by the recollection of the impulses that were released in the French nineteenth century by the writers whom Riviere very probably had in mind, by such men as Baudelaire and Rim 144</page><page sequence="2">ZONE ZERO baud and Lautréamont, the great poetes maudtits of the period. French Romanticism had, it is true, in the generation of Chateaubriand and Lamartine and Musset an elegiac phase that was comparable to the English movement represented by Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley. But by the time a later generation had awakened to the barren emptiness that ap peared to be at the center of the world, as it was represented to them by the great secularizing movements on the Conti nent of Comte and Darwin—by this time, the quiet melan choly of Lamartine and the lachrymose sentimentality of Müsset had to give way before some desperate and blasphemous stratagem of "metaphysical revolution" or "sabotage." It is in the career that produced Les Fleurs du Mal that we have the great type and example of this disaffection, for, though Baudelaire does not represent its extremest forms, it was he who gave to the new sensibility its vocabulary and its defining style. The atmosphere in which he lived was, of course, one that was very largely formed by the influences of Comte and Bernard and Renan and Taine and Herbert Spencer: which is to say that Baudelaire's was, as T. S. Eliot characterized it, "... an age of bustle, [of] programmes, plat forms, scientific progress, humanitarianism and revolutions which improved nothing, an age of progressive degradation." It was, in other words, a time in which all the complex multidimensionality of existence was being scaled down to the univocal simplicities with which positive science could deal. And in such a time as this a man in whom there re mained so large a residue of theological preoccupation as Baudelaire retained was bound to assert that human reality is something immensely more rich and complicated than was implied to be the case by the Cours de Philosophie Positive. Baudelaire's way of making this insistence was to declare that the world is a "forest of symbols." This is the central phrase in "Les Correspondances," which is one of the cen tral poems of his career, and the phrase was, I take it, for him a way of asserting that our deepest and intensest experi 145</page><page sequence="3">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW enees of our world-environment are always suffused by a sense of encounter with dimensions of reality transcendent to the immediate data presented by the world itself. The most interesting phenomena in our experience, that is, are distinguished by a kind of inexhaustibility—which is not simply a matter of their having a structural complexity that we generally have not sufficient time in our lives fully to examine: no, their inexhaustibility strikes us rather as a consequence of their pointing to depths within themselves that are essentially and radically mysterious. I encounter this person or this expression of the natural universe in the full ness of his or its essential being, and in the moment of this encounter I am conscious, in the words of T. M. Greene, of this particular finite reality: ". . . half-revealing a transfinite dimension within itself, a tap root which seems to connect it, vertically as it were, with what Paul Tillich has called the ultimate Source, Ground, and Abyss of all finite reality, i.e., with the 'really real' from which the merely phenom enally or finitely real derives its being and its vitality." This is, I think, something of what Baudelaire intended to be the real meaning of "Les Correspondances." The world is a "forest of symbols," and so the task of poetry is that of de ciphering the obscure revelations of "infinite things" that are offered by the vast field of existential reality. It is, indeed, just when we understand in this way the mes sage of "Les Correspondances" that we can see the relation between this central concept in Baudelaire's poetics (of the world, that is, as a "forest of symbols") and the idea of the gouffre which gains its definitive expression in the great poem "Le Voyage," whose closing lines advise us to: Plonger au fond du gouffre, Enfer ou Ciel, qu'importe? Au fond de l'lnconnu pour trouver du nouveau! We must plunge into the gouffre, into the Abyss, for, if the world is resonant of "infinite things," then we cannot be satisfied with the forest of symbols, since it is but a point of departure and a way of moving into the unplumbed depths of Being-itself. But, though the poet's function is to locate 146</page><page sequence="4">ZONE ZERO "les splendeurs situées derriére le tombeau," he must never cease to be on guard against the treacherous uncertainties of life: he is le dandy who forges a mask of feigned indifference and hauteur wherewith to defend himself against the taciturn indifference of the world. And it is in the theory of corre spondence, the idea of the gouffre, and the theory of dandy ism that we have the basic premises of Baudelaire's under standing of the poetic enterprise. Now Baudelairean dandyism moves into an even more strident and high-pitched key in the Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse), whose Les Chants de Maldoror is perhaps one of the half-dozen most important poetic texts of the nine teenth century. And what is decisive about this dandy who is the hero of Lautréamont's poem is that i I voudrait égaler Dieu. In one of the great scenes of the poem, for example, Maldoror is seated at the seashore, when a sudden storm batters a ship against a reef, scattering the sailors amidst the wreckage in the water. And, as the men are attacked by sharks, Maldoror assists the sharks with his gun in finishing them off, so that the men might enjoy the benediction of returning to their piscatory ancestors of the deep. Then, when the ship has sunk and the water is crimson with the sailors' blood, a monstrously fierce female shark turns on the other sharks to destroy them—whereupon Maldoror comes to her assistance with his gun and his knife. And when they have all been slain, he then, alone now in the water with the female shark, embraces her with the ardor of a lover. Thus it is that he seeks to recreate himself, to give himself a new form of being, and, in doing so, to assert his equality with the great Enemy: his stratagem, in plunging into the sea, is to forsake the earth and to wage an open war against creation; and his "frightful copulation" with the shark is but the sign of his desire to descend into the gouffre and, by an act of rape and sabotage, to take possession of the prehistoric mysteries of existence. Like the dogs whom he sees howling, as though they were raging against life itself, Maldoror tells us that he too feels "le besoin de l'infini," and, in his quest of it, he does not 147</page><page sequence="5">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW propose to be hindered by anything at all, not even by reason itself: indeed, if reason is inhibiting, then it must be syste matically unhinged. For the great thing is "le réve sur naturel," and, for this, the poet must be prepared to convert himself into a monster: this is Lautréamont's terrible and insolent lesson: reason must be prepared to become unrea son, man must be prepared to become a beast, poetry must be prepared to become non-poetry for the sake of "le réve surnaturel." But for all of the dark and horrible audacity of Lautréa mont, this French drama of baptism in the gouffre finds its great theoretician in the nineteenth century in the boy-poet of Charleville, Arthur Rimbaud, who assisted Baudelaire, says Jacques Maritain, in making "modern art pass the frontiers of the spirit." And the key to both his masterpieces, Les Illuminations and Une Saison en En]er, is to be found in his Lettre du 15 mai i8yr to his friend Paul Demeny, written at the age of seventeen. Here is the crucial passage; he says: The first study for a man who wants to be a poet is the knowledge of himself, entire. He looks for his soul, inspects it, learns it. As soon as he knows it, he cultivates it: it seems sim ple: in every brain a natural development is accomplished: so many egoists proclaim themselves authors; others attribute their intellectual progress to themselves! But the soul has to be made monstrous, that's the point:—like comprachicos, if you like! Imagine a man planting and cultivating warts on his face. One must, I say, be a seer, make oneself a seer. The poet makes himself a seer through a long, a prodigious and rational disordering of all the senses. Every form of love, of suffering, of madness; he searches himself, he consumes all the poisons in him, keeping only their quintessences. Ineffable torture in which he will need all his faith and superhuman strength, the great criminal, the great sickman, the utterly damned, and the supreme Savant! For he arrives at the un known! Since he has cultivated his soul—richer to begin with than any other! He arrives at the unknown: and even if, half crazed, in the end, he loses the understanding of his visions, he has seen them! Let him croak in his leap into those unutterable and innumerable things: there will come other horrible work ers: they will begin at the horizons where he has succumbed. 148</page><page sequence="6">ZONE ZERO Now here we have a most candid expression of a kind of radicalism in French tradition of the nineteenth century of which Rimbaud is perhaps the extreme instance. And, in this present context, what is chiefly significant is that he, like Lautreamont, in defining the poet's task as that of mapping out the gouffre, converts him into a priest whose work becomes an "incantation toward the miracle." The poet, he says, must make himself a seer, even if this means that reason is capsized utterly: and if reason is deranged, then surely language itself will begin to disintegrate also. But these are consequences which Rimbaud faced with com plete fearlessness and lack of regret, for he was bent on turn ing poetry into a technique of science, a technique whereby the whole fabric of things might be somehow conquered and made accessible to poetic cognition. As Marcel Raymond puts it: . . he lived for the sake of those exceptional adventures in which the universe, finally given back to itself, is experi enced from the inside like an imponderable blazing mass whence flaming forms gush forth, to fall endlessly." Which is to say that this demon-ridden sorcerer was gambling on a kind of divine omniscience that would finally make poetry unnecessary. So it is no wonder, despite the occasional con tact that they make with the world of familiar experience, that his poems are so elusive, so baffling, so strange. "Resting on precarious foundations and always uncertain of their own identity,..." Raymond summarizes, "things escape from them selves and burst the framework in which we enclose them; despite their relief, their density in each of the situations in which the poet places them, they glide from one form to another like the ephemeral images in a kaleidoscope." This was, of course, Rimbaud's way into "the voluptuousness of nirvana," into the Zone of Zero, into a state of mystical clairvoyance in which poetic discourse would be superfluous —and the point is that the gymnastics of this way involved such an overstraining of language till it had finally to be come simply an object of exasperation. So we are not sur prised that this choreographer of the word should have gone on to exhaust not only "every form of love, of suffering, of 149</page><page sequence="7">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW madness," but should have gone on to exhaust even his medium itself and should have lapsed into silence at the age of nineteen, spending the remaining eighteen years of his unhappy life in an aimless vagabondage over the European and African continents. II Baudelaire, then, Lautréamont, Rimbaud—these are the three main sources of a tradition in modern literature which, in various ways since their time, has been extended by Mallarmé and Valéry and the Surrealists. And despite the enormous diversity of aim and method that is contained within this tradition, its unitary principle is a result of the fact that it is a tradition which always manages to accede to the demurrer which Jean Cocteau entered many years ago when he said: "Literature is impossible. We must get out of it. No use trying to get out through more literature." These three Frenchmen of the nineteenth century were among the first of the great pioneering visionaries of their period (Dostoievski, Van Gogh, Nietzsche, Melville) to face the precariousness of human existence and the remoteness of Meaning in the time of the absent God. And, being un able to accept the self-evident certitudes of the complacent positivism of their age, they turned to poetry itself as the "sacred action" best calculated to break the silence of the gouffre, to guarantee, as Raymond says: ". . . the blessed emergence of the exceptional moment in which all the en ergies of life are polarized around a single focus, and nothing in the world exists except its luminous radiance." They con ceived the poet's mission to be one of subverting, of sabotag ing, the banal immediacies of nature and human society, of transcending all the conventional possibilities of experience, in order that access might be won to that "really real" which lies beyond what Coleridge called "the world of familiarity and selfish solicitude." Like Hölderlin, they defined the office of the poet in terms at once priestly and prophetic, agreeing with their German progenitor that poetry's business is with the "naming" of the gods and that its primary func 15°</page><page sequence="8">ZONE ZERO tion is not mimesis, not expression, but revelation, the bring ing forth of creation, as it were, all over again, as if God had never acted, or as if His original action now required repetition. The tradition, in other words, that extends from the great poetes maudits of the mid-nineteenth century through Mal larmé and Valéry to Pierre Reverdy and the Surrealists André Breton and Louis Aragon is a tradition in our literature whose aim it has been to liberate the mind from the frag mentation and illusoriness of finite reality, in order that it might somehow gain an entry into the dark and primitive depths of Being-itself: the goal is that cosmic point where all the scattered leaves of life are into one Volume bound, where substance and accidents, and their modes, are all fused together into one blazing flame. "Poetry," said Valéry, "is an attempt to represent or to restore, by articulate language, those things or that thing, which tears, cries, caresses, kisses, sighs, etc. try obscurely to express." And, in his Second Mani feste, André Breton declared: Everything suggests the belief that there is a certain point of the mind where life and death, the real and the imaginary, the past and the future, the communicable and the incommunica ble, the high and the low are no longer perceived as contradic tions. It would be vain to look for any motive in surrealist activity other than the hope of determining that point. Or, as this ultimate goal was classically put by Rimbaud in Une Saison en Enfer: "I wrote of silences, of nights, I noted down the inexpressible. I pinned down fits of giddiness." Now, having converted poetry into a species of magic, this is a line of writers who have had to practice a most radical kind of chemistry on their inherited language. Whether we turn to Rimbaud or to Mallarmé or to Valéry or to Breton, we are in the presence of artists who believe that what the new Oxford philosophers call "ordinary language" is a lan guage too wooden and fossilized to serve as anything other than a kind of rough tool of the marketplace. For the hazardous adventure of poetry a very much finer medium is needed: words must be divested of their conventional sig 151</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW nifications, in order that their original innocence may be restored. Standing, as he does, at a point of intersection be tween the plane of the familiar banalities of normal experi ence and the plane of "le réve surnaturel," the poet must derange not only his senses perhaps, as Rimbaud advised, but also his language, if he is to do justice to his vision. For words cannot be vehicles of supernature, if they are used by the poet as they are used by the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick-maker: they must be liberated from the tyranny of reason and allowed to chase one another into the kinds of subtle modulations and ensembles whereby we may win the ultimate transverberation by the Divine Dark. And this is, indeed, the perilous experiment that was fostered by this tradition. "Real life," said Rimbaud, "is elsewhere," and, in the line of modern writers running from Baudelaire and Lautréamont through Mallarmé and Valéry to André Breton and Paul Eluard, the work of art was conceived to be a kind of demiurgic passport to this uncharted and distant region. But, of course, language, even at its volatile best, is a most frail and imperfect instrument of the miraculous. And how ever relentlessly the artist seeks to make it the servant of some sacral grammar and logic of his own creation, it does persist, with its clumsy inflexibility, in performing its cus tomarily mundane and ostensive functions. So it was in evitable that the kind of radicalism we have been canvassing should issue in a profound despair of language and of litera ture, for what had been sought was an ineffable ultimacy of Being that had necessarily to be betrayed by the concretions of verbal discourse. The difficult paradox in which these writers had become enmeshed was a result of the fact that, through poetic forms, they were seeking to transcend all forms: through language, they were seeking to liberate them selves from all the distortions of reality that inhere in lan guage as such: and this, however exhilarating the attempt might be, was something which, in the nature of the case, could never be quite managed. So, after completing Une Saison en Enfer in the summer of 1873, Rimbaud abdicated from poetry altogether. And, after finally facing his own 152</page><page sequence="10">ZONE ZERO ultimate inability to bully language into conquering the primordial Mystery, Mallarmé had to confess his disen chantment with "the literary game." And Paul Valéry came to speak of the work of art as a "forgery." And the distin guished critic Marcel Arland, in an early essay which ap peared in the Nouvelle Revue Frangaise in 1924, noticed the fact that . . literature ... no longer charms us very much." And one could fill up several pages with the indictments and denials and rejections of literature with which the modern French tradition is bestrewn: the very word littérature has, in fact, become a pejorative for the avant-garde, and it is one of the great ironies in the literary life of our time, that a tradition which expected more of literature than any other had ever done has, over the last fifty years, been developing a most profound and deep-seated aversion to it, the feeling, as Cocteau says, that it "is impossible," that "we must get out of it. No use trying to get out through more literature." It is, indeed, this despair of "the literary game" that con stitutes what is undoubtedly the basic premise of many of those writers of the present time in France who, in the years since the close of the Second War, have emerged into promi nence as the chief creators of what Claude Mauriac calls the new alittérature. And I do not think that we can hope to "place" novelists like Alain Robbe-Grillet and Nathalie Sar raute or dramatists like Arthur Adamov and Eugene Ionesco except in terms of the kind of distrust of the literary enter prise that is bequeathed to them by the classic generations of modern France: this is what they take for granted, and this is the essential clue to all the new projects that they are at tempting to devise. In the theatre of Ionesco, it is drama it self that is under attack; in the fiction of Michel Butor and Nathalie Sarraute, the novel itself is something that, in effect, we are asked to regard as questionable and problematic; and their contemporaries are, most of them, "anti-dramatists" and "anti-novelists." So it is not surprising that for many of the strategists of "the new literature" that strange book Le Theatre et son double should have attained a kind of keryg matic status, for the mad genius from whose pen it came, *53</page><page sequence="11">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Antonin Artaud, was a theorist who, with his characteristic perversity, insisted on placing at the center of his poetics the notions of the emptiness and futility of literature. But though this disenchantment with literature that char acterizes the new heroes of the avant-garde in France is, as a habit of mind, a bequest which they receive from their classic modern tradition, it is something that, in them, has not the same roots that it had in a Rimbaud or a Mallarmé. For, in the great innovating pioneers, it was a result of a thwarted nostalgia: they were writers who, having heard a disastrous retreat in the heavens above, experienced the world as "a desert of loss," and they hoped to find in the rich re sources of poetic art a means of satisfying their ontological hunger, a way of bridging the Abyss or of invoking into it a good and gratifying Presence: and the inadequacy of poiesis to the burden which they imposed upon it was the cause of their despairing of literature. But the generation of Ionesco and Robbe-Grillet is a generation that takes the death of God for granted as casually as it does the fact that Tuesday follows Monday, and its lack of confidence in the literary project, far from being a result of a frustrated Promethean ism, is simply a consequence of its assumption of the funda mental meaninglessness of human existence. The dourness of the new temper does not, in other words, follow so much upon the frustration of a Promethean effort as it does upon a sense of the futility of all Prometheanism which has meta physical ambitions. It is, indeed, this strict astringency of their vision that im pels these writers to practice a most ruthless kind of askésis upon their art. For, given the essentially incoherent char acter of existence, they feel that, in so far as the novelist, for example, imposes such order upon experience as traditional structures of plot and character involve, he does to that ex tent falsify reality and is guilty of dishonesty: he produces mere "literature." Of all this—the old eloquence, the old psychological analysis, the old "stories"—the novel must be purified. And, similarly, in the drama, neither the tradition, say, of Ibsen nor of Chekhov can any longer avail, for the 154</page><page sequence="12">ZONE ZERO theatre must be stripped of every representational pretension, if it is to be, in Giraudoux's phrase, "an evening school for adults;" indeed, Eugene Ionesco speaks of his play La Canta trice chauve (The Bald Soprano) as an "anti-play," and the whole new avant-garde theatre in France might be said to be an anti-theatre, a theatre deliberately disdaining subject matter and "anthropomorphism" and intent upon exposing the veritable nothingness that is at the center of human life. Roland Barthes is one of the recognized spokesmen for the new program, and he is eager for his colleagues to bring us ". . . to the doors of a world without literature about which, however, it will be up to the writers to testify"—and to testify by way of what he calls Le degré zero d'écriture ("the zero degree of writing"): only thus can the writer be an honest man—by expunging from his books every last iota of message, of significant action, and of "style." For writing, says M. Barthes, ". . . is in no way a means of communica tion;" he agrees with the novelist Jean Cayrol that ours is a "desolate world of absence," and he also agrees with the Sartre who sometimes seems to feel that the writer's sole business today is to be a kind of laconic witness to the death of man. Ill Perhaps the chief theorist of this new attitude is the young writer Alain Robbe-Grillet, whose drastic conclusions ex emplify a complete fearlessness of their own rigorous and insolent logic. His chief concern has been with the novel, this being the field of his own creative practice; and the basic presupposition on which his own literary career is based is that "... the art of the novel. . . has achieved such a degree of stagnation . . . that it is scarcely imaginable that it can survive for long without radical changes." What it must be liberated from is the tradition of "psychological analysis," for this is a tradition whose assumptions about the unity of per sonality have long since lost any genuine relevance to the modern experience: the tradition, in other words, of Madame de la Fayette, of Stendhal, of Flaubert, of Proust, has reached 155</page><page sequence="13">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW a point of utter exhaustion, and what is required now is "... a revolution more total [even] than those from which such movements as romanticism and naturalism were born." M. Robbe-Grillet's prescription for the present malaise in volves what is, for him, the most radical request that can be made—namely, the request that le nouveau roman be done in such a way as to discard the old "sacrosanct psychological analysis" and to invite the reader ". . . to look at the world which surrounds him with entirely unprejudiced eyes." For surely, he contends, the most remarkable thing about the world is simply that it is. "Around us, defying the mob of our animistic or protective adjectives, things are there. Their surfaces are clear and smooth, intact, neither dubiously glit tering, nor transparent. All our literature has not yet suc ceeded in penetrating their smallest corner, in softening their slightest curve." Now it is in the cinema that M. Robbe-Grillet finds the best clues to the direction that the novel of the future must take. It too is an heir of the psychological tradition, and very often it ". . . has as its sole purpose the transposition of a story into images." But ". . . the very conventions of the photographic medium" have a way of drawing us out of our comfortable interiorities—so that, however much, in the literary text that forms the basis of the scenario, the empty chair may have been a sign of absence or the hand placed on a shoulder a sign of friendliness or the bars on a window a sign of the impossibility of leaving: ... in the cinema, one sees the chair too, the movement of the hand, the shape of the bars. What they signify remains obvious, but, instead of monopolizing our attention, it becomes some thing added, even something in excess, because what touches us, what persists in our memory, what appears as essential and irreducible to vague intellectual concepts, are the gestures themselves, the objects, the movements, and the contours, to which the image has suddenly (and unintentionally) restored their reality. It is, in other words, in its tendency to move away from a "universe of 'signification' (psychological, social, functional)" 156</page><page sequence="14">ZONE ZERO that the cinema suggests a method of renewal for the novel, and a method whereby the novel may attain to greater truth to the actualities of man's being-in-the-world. For the movie camera, in vivifying the sheer thereness of familiar gestures and objects and in making them appear, through their very vividness, somehow alien and strange, has the effect of mak ing us look at the actual world that surrounds us, as it were for the first time, so that we become aware of its strangeness and of its imperviousness to every system of meaning. And this, M. Robbe-Grillet believes, must be the purpose of the novel of the future: it must become le roman objectif, ex hibiting the world in its brute hecceity and in its unyielding resistance to all our characteristic habits of apprehension and order. So, in his own novelistic practice, and notably in Le Voyeur and La Jalousie, M. Robbe-Grillet does not, as he insists, "set out to create characters or tell stories." He wants instead to focus our attention upon the external world, and what we are struck by in his fictions is the virtual disappearance of the human protagonist: the world of his novels is a world, it seems, in which there is no room for man, all the available room being taken up by the hard, resistant materialities with which the ghostly remnants of men collide. Indeed, in La Jalousie, though the angle of narration is that of the "first" person, there is not a single reference in the entire novel to "I" or "me," so that Bruce Morrissette speaks of the book's narrative point of view as that of the "absent I." Or Le Voyeur, for example, opens with the docking at a pier of a ship which carries the central personage of the novel, Mathias, and here is a passage dwelling on details of the sort to which the novelist devotes himself, with an absolutely in credible singlemindedness, for page after page after page: The pier, now quite close, towered several yards above the deck. The tide must have been out. The landing slip from which the ship would be boarded revealed the smoother surface of its lower section, darkened by the water and half-covered with greenish moss. On closer inspection, the stone rim drew almost imperceptibly closer. 157</page><page sequence="15">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The stone rim—an oblique, sharp edge formed by two inter secting perpendicular planes: the vertical embankment per pendicular to the quay and the ramp leading to the top of the pier—was continued along its upper side at the top of the pier by a horizontal line extending straight toward the quay. The pier, which seemed longer than it actually was as an effect of perspective, extended from both sides of this base line in a cluster of parallels describing, with a precision accentuated even more sharply by the morning light, a series of elongated planes alternately horizontal and vertical: the crest of the mas sive parapet that protected the tidal basin from the open sea, the inner wall of the parapet, the jetty along the top of the pier, and the vertical embankment that plunged straight into the water of the harbor. The two vertical surfaces were in shadow, the other two brilliantly lit by the sun—the whole breadth of the parapet and all of the jetty save for one dark narrow strip: the shadow cast by the parapet. Theoretically, the reversed image of the entire group could be seen reflected in the harbor water, and, on the surface, still within the same play of parallels, the shadow cast by the vertical embankment extending straight toward the quay. At the end of the jetty the structure grew more elaborate; the pier divided into two parts; on the parapet side, a narrow passageway leading to a beacon light, and on the left the land ing slip sloping down into the water. It was this latter inclined rectangle, seen obliquely, that attracted notice; slashed diag noally by the shadow of the embankment it skirted, it showed up as one dark triangle and one bright. All other surfaces were blurred. The water in the harbor was not calm enough for the reflection of the pier to be distinguished. Similarly the shadow of the pier appeared only as a vague strip. . . . Here, indeed, is a refusal of "psychological analysis"—and with a vengeance. But M. Robbe-Grillet is nothing if not consistent; and, since he has no interest in the feelings, in the thoughts, in the inwardness, of his characters, he proceeds, with a most astonishing relentlessness, to describe simply the strange opaqueness and density of the world's surfaces, and this is done with a thoroughness that is surely without paral lel in the history of the novel. He . . intends," says the French critic Bernard Dort, "to stick to zero," and his "ob jectal" catalogues are designed to undo what he calls "the old myth of 'depth,' " by converting human reality into a 158</page><page sequence="16">ZONE ZERO kind of frozen "still life" in which there is not the merest trace of I'humaine presence, but only angles and planes and streets and houses and skies—and objects and gestures. It is, we might say, an art which mimes the act of suicide: the novelist opts for things and against man. Now, among the writers on the French scene today who are commonly regarded as the chief practitioners of le nouveau roman (Nathalie Sarraute, Jean Cayrol, Claude Simon, and Michel Butor being perhaps the chief figures), Alain Robbe-Grillet has been highly publicized. And the more scrupulous critics are often at pains, and rightly so, to remind us that this is a group which contains within itself a very great degree of diversity and that all its members can not, therefore, be subsumed under the program of any single figure. This is, of course, a salutary caution, and one which we ought by no means to disregard, but it ought not to in timidate us into disregarding the significant affinities that these writers have with one another. It is true that, in lan guage and composition and structure, Nathalie Sarraute's procedures differ sharply from Michel Butor's, as do Claude Simon's from Marguerite Duras'. But, careful as we must be about discriminations of this sort, it would, at the same time, be foolish for us to ignore the fact that all these writers live out of and evoke essentially the same general ethos, and it is of this that M. Robbe-Grillet is a representative, though perhaps by no means the most impressive, instance. As I think of this whole effort that is being undertaken today in France, I am at times put in mind of the somewhat parallel effort in modern painting that began with Cézanne and that culminated in the great adventure of Cubism. And, admittedly, the "objectivism" of M. Robbe-Grillet makes the parallel much more exact in his case than in that of certain of the other writers with whom he is associated. But, in them all, we feel that the literary project is being directed by the need to dismantle the world and put it back together again— perhaps in order that it might be discovered where we are, and possibly who we are. They are all bent upon recon structing either the raw materiality of the external world (as 159</page><page sequence="17">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW in the case of Alain Robbe-Grillet) or the elementary forms of consciousness itself (as in the case of Nathalie Sarraute); and, in this way, they are all, in one degree or another, sys tematicians. But, at the same time, though they all have a certain passion for reconstruction, they are eager to dispense with what Claude Simon disapprovingly calls "la merveil leuse illusion." They do not want, by means of the conven tional "verisimilitudes" of prose narrative, to impose order and structure upon a world in which, as they experience it, there actually is no order or structure. This is why so often they deliberately refuse to look at anything other than the surfaces of the world: and this is also why, deliberately re fusing "the myth of 'depth' " (with its fictions of "character" and "story"), their novels are often like a sentence which, despite its complex and ingeniously woven texture, remains suspended in mid-air. Indeed, in a universe which is absurd and in which therefore we cannot escape from despairing of literature, finally, they do all do what Bernard Dort describes Alain Robbe-Grillet as doing: "they stick to zero." And the emphasis, as M. Dort reminds us, is to be placed on the stick ing. For the generation of Joyce and Kafka and Musil did not, as he says: . . . banish meanings. Anything but. They piled one meaning on the other so that in the end these might exterminate each other. They did not repudiate the idea of a totality. Anything but. But their totality had a minus sign. It was indeed an addi tion of the greatest possible number of meanings, but the total always tended to zero. But, as he says of M. Robbe-Grillet, and as we might also say of many of the other new heroes of the French avant-garde— they stick to zero, and this it is which defines their literary and spiritual position in the cultural life of our time. IV Now it is one of the oddities of modern literature that the most impressive representative of this radical French contem porary tradition is the man from Ireland, Samuel Beckett, who has lived in France off and on for more than thirty 160</page><page sequence="18">ZONE ZERO years and whose most important works have been written in the French language (many of which, however, he has him self translated into English, which is his native tongue). In him the dark, seedy, claustral universe of the new nihilism has its most ingenious and resourceful cartographer. There is perhaps no single point at which it is necessary to begin either the reading or the analysis of Mr. Beckett's books. For, though the author of the trilogy Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable (written in the years since the Second World War) has won a kind of rhetorical brilliance and expertise that the author of Murphy (1938) had not yet achieved, the entire body of his work is characterized by a singularly unchanging mood and orientation. His novels and his plays, from beginning to end, evoke a world in which the despair and the defeat of man are so absolute as to be almost beyond the possibility of dramatization: it is a world in which the individual lives, in his own description, in those ". . . perilous zones . . . dangerous, precarious, painful . . . [where] the boredom of living is replaced by the suffering of being." And it is a world of utter destitution, of utter in digence; his protagonists are old men—half-blind, stinking, lame and physically broken, bedridden or dependent on crutches or even at times reduced to crawling about over the surface of the earth. And not only are they cripples who fart incessantly and who cannot control their bladders: they are also paupers whose nakedness is barely covered by castoff rags and whose residence is under a withered tree or in garbage cans or insane asylums or on some cold and forsaken patch of ground under a vacant, unconsoling sky. They are impotent and ignorant, uncertain who they are or where they are and unable to hold the present moment in any kind of coherent relation to the past. They are lonely and without connections, and, even when they do stumble across another derelict in their wilderness, having lost the knack of com munication, their stutterings and stammerings cannot be an instrument of communion. So the dominating image that is formed by Murphy and Watt, by Molloy and Malone, by Vladimir and Estragon, is an image of denudation, of divest 161</page><page sequence="19">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ment, of abortion and loss. And a by no means uncharac teristic scene is that formed by the "mime for one player" called "Act Without Words," which is appended to the American edition of Endgame: its single actor is situated on a stage which is described as a desert of dazzling light. And, time and again, he hears whistles first from the right and then from the left wing. But, each time he goes out into either wing, he is flung back onto the stage—though, each time, he gets up, dusts himself, and, after reflecting, goes off to respond to the whistle from whichever direction it comes. Finally, however, he thinks better of this and ignores a whistle that comes from the left wing. Then, to the accom paniment of whistles from above, various objects begin to be lowered—which are snatched upwards, however, each time he reaches for them. So, at the last, he simply . . remains lying on his side, his face towards auditorium, staring before him," and, though a carafe continues to be lowered and dangled before his face, he disregards it now: "he does not move" and simply "looks at his hands," his position being rather like that of Moran (Molloy's pursuer) in Molloy, who, as his leg begins to stiffen with paralysis, thinks to himself: Such are the advantages of a local and painless paralysis. . . . To be literally incapable of motion at last, that must be some thing! My mind swoons when I think of it. And mute into the bargain! And perhaps as deaf as a post! And who knows as blind as a bat! And as likely as not your memory a blank! And just enough brain intact to allow you to exult! And to dread death like a regeneration. This is, indeed, the position of the poor isolatoes whom we meet in Beckett's plays and fiction: they are bereft of every imaginable security, and, in their cheerless, hopeless world of Zero, they have only enough vitality remaining to sum mon a dry and feeble gesture of irony, the suggestion that, maimed though they are, they can still perhaps exult in Nothingness. Murphy, the book of 1938, which was Beckett's first ven ture into the novel (his previously published work having consisted of the essay on Proust, the poem of 1930, Whoro 162</page><page sequence="20">ZONE ZERO scope, the volume of stories More Pricks Than Kicks, and the collection of verse Echo's Bones), gives a statement of the world's absurdity which is uncharacteristic of the later novels only in the relatively greater lucidity of its plot and char acters; but, in the disenchantment of its vision, it is of a piece with the entire body of his work. Murphy is a Dubliner living in London on hand-outs, a "seedy solipsist" who be lieves his mind to be "a large hollow sphere, hermetically closed to the universe without." And he wants to shut out the world because its irrationality and disorder leave him no hope at all of coming to terms with it successfully: the only kingdom, he feels, in which he has any kind of chance is the kingdom of his own mind, and this it is, therefore, that he seeks to withdraw into. He wants to be "but a mote in the dark of absolute freedom," and his way of inducing this nirvana-like euphoria in himself is to strap himself naked into a rocking chair, and then to rock and rock and rock and rock until he "comes alive in his mind." His progress, however, away from the insecurities of the world of "extension" and into the dark, inner room of the self is complicated by his love for the prostitute Celia, a voluptuous creature who, in her locomotions, is "accom panied delightedly by her hips, etc." And she, loving Murphy but also wanting respectability and an assured place in so ciety, insists upon his getting a job—which, when at last it is secured, turns out to be a post as orderly in an insane asylum. "What more vigorous fillip could be given to the wallows of one bogged in the big world than the example of life to all appearance inalienably realized in the little?" And, indeed, Murphy does "call sanctuary what the psychiatrists called exile," finding a strange sort of happiness amongst the mad and the deranged, since they have already entered the zone which he attempts to reach by means of his rocking chair. But this happiness is short-lived, for, one day, while tied to his rocker in one of his self-induced trances, he burns to death. In his will he had left the following directions regarding the disposal of his remains: 163</page><page sequence="21">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW I desire that they be burnt and placed in a paper bag and brought to the Abbey Theatre, Lr. Abbey Street, Dublin, and without pause into what the great and good Lord Chesterfield calls the necessary house, where their happiest hours have been spent, on the right as one goes down into the pit, and I desire that the chain be there pulled upon them, if possible during the performance of a piece, the whole to be executed without ceremony or show of grief. But, unfortunately, Cooper, to whom the ashes are entrusted, before he can flush them down the toilet in the Abbey Theatre, becomes involved in a barroom brawl, and, in a moment of anger, takes the packet of ash from his pocket, "where earlier in the evening he had put it for greater se curity," and throws it at the man who had offended him: It bounced, burst, off the wall on to the floor, where at once it became the object of much dribbling, passing, trapping, shoot ing, punching, heading and even some recognition from the gentleman's code. By closing time the body, mind and soul of Murphy were freely distributed over the floor of the saloon; and before another dayspring greyened the earth had been swept away with the sand, the beer, the butts, the glass, the matches, the spits, the vomit. Now this is the kind of ghastly concatenation of events that the logic of Beckett's fiction persuades us to regard as natural and expectable in a universe that is utterly absurd and prob ably even maleficent. It is the world of the "underground man," the best of all possible worlds perhaps, but a world blanketed by irrationality and gratuitousness and grotes querie. And had Murphy been asked to define his idea of eternity, one imagines that he might well have agreed with Dostoievski's Svidrigailov, that the other world in all prob ability is "peopled with spiders," a sort of "dark recess . . . [or] bathroom crammed with spiders in all the corners." So it is no wonder, then, that the protagonist of Watt (written in the Vaucluse during the German occupation of France, and published in 1953) is a man who is continually shuffling and reshuffling the most elementary percepts of his experience, in an effort to descry some merest vestige of a pattern beneath the disarray and fracture of existence. Watt 164</page><page sequence="22">ZONE ZERO is a seedy little cypher with a "big red nose and no fixed address" whom we suddenly see one evening disembarking from a tram and making his way on to the railway-station, where he takes a train and begins a journey. Then, with no explanation of where it is that he gets off the train, we find him continuing his journey by hiking across a countryside. Like all of Beckett's heroes, he is physically maimed and crippled—so that his: . . . way of advancing due east, for example, was to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north and at the same time to fling out his right leg as far as possible towards the south, and then to turn his bust as far as possible towards the south and at the same time to fling out his left leg as far as possible towards the north, and then again to turn his bust as far as possible towards the north. . . . The knees . . . did not bend. . .. The arms were content to dangle, in perfect equipendency. In the course of this trip by foot—which he interrupts to rest in a ditch—he is assaulted by a Lady McCann, who throws a stone at him, "... with all her might, which, when she was roused, was not negligible. . . . And it is to be sup posed that God, always favourable to the McCanns of ? , guided her hand." But Watt, "faithful to his rule . . . [takes] no more notice of this aggression than if it had been an accident. ... For it was an attitude become, with frequent repetition, so part of his being, that there was no more room in his mind for resentment." Then, at last, he arrives at nightfall at the house of a Mr. Knott, and it appears that in this establishment there is a job waiting for him. He at first finds both the back and the front doors locked, but, on returning to the rear en trance, discovers, to his astonishment, that, though lately locked, it is now open: how this happened he never learns. After managing to get in, he takes a seat in a parlor, ap parently intending to sit there through the silent gloom of the night, "picking his nose, waiting for the dawn to break." But his vigil is soon interrupted by the appearance of a loquacious fellow named Arsene, who is being replaced in Mr. Knott's house, it seems, by Watt. And the remainder of 165</page><page sequence="23">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Part I of the novel is devoted to a long monologue in which, presumably, it is Arsene's intention to orient his successor to his new situation. But his tips are fringed with irony, for, as he says, he once knew a Mr. Ash, whom he met one evening on Westminster Bridge and who announced the time to him as "seventeen minutes past five exactly," whereupon Big Ben then immediately struck the hour of six o'clock—and that, says Arsene, is "the type of all information whatsoever, be it voluntary or solicited." With the beginning of Part II, Watt is already an estab lished retainer in Mr. Knott's household, and from this point on he is involved in an unending struggle to understand the logic or the illogic that forms the basis of all the various ar rangements of life in this strange house. He is, for example, baffled by what seems to be the very incommensurateness of language itself with the realities of existence in the world of Mr. Knott: he finds himself "in the midst of things which, if they consented to be named, did so as it were with reluc tance:" Looking at a pot, for example, or thinking of a pot, at one of Mr. Knott's pots, of one of Mr. Knott's pots, it was in vain that Watt said, Pot, pot. Well, perhaps not quite in vain, but very nearly. For it was not a pot, the more he looked, the more he reflected, the more he felt sure of that, that it was not a pot at all. It resembled a pot, it was almost a pot, but it was not a pot of which one could say, Pot, pot, and be comforted. It was in vain that it answered, with unexceptionable adequacy, all the purposes, and performed all the offices, of a pot, it was not a pot. And it was just this hairbreadth departure from the nature of a true pot that so excruciated Watt. Indeed, now that he is a denizen of Mr. Knott's establish ment, he even makes ". . . the distressing discovery that of himself too he could no longer affirm anything that did not seem as false as if he had affirmed it of a stone." This helpless bafflement of Watt before the irrationality of life in Mr. Knott's house is most especially instanced by his response to the visit of the Galls, the father and son who come to tune the piano. The senior Gall is blind: so it is his son who tunes the piano, while his father simply stands 166</page><page sequence="24">ZONE ZERO in the center of the music-room. Then, when the work is done, the son speaks of the mice having returned and of the piano being doomed—and, these cryptic remarks being con cluded, they leave. And the incident strikes Watt as being like so many other happenings in Mr. Knott's house—in that "it was not ended, when it was past, but continued to un fold, in . . . [his] head, from beginning to end, over and over again." It was not simply a matter of two piano-tuners having come to the house and tuned the piano, exchanged a few words, and then left: no, this was simply the outer image of how something else had happened—but he can never de termine what this something else is. Yet the mere fact of his being unable to determine the meaning of this and similar occurrences does not distress him so much as does his hunch that in incidents such as this: ... a thing that was nothing had happened, with the utmost formal distinctness, and that it continued to happen, in his mind. . . . Yes, Watt could not accept . . . that nothing had happened, with all the clarity and solidity of something, and that it revisited him in such a way that he was forced to sub mit to it all over again. . . . [Italics provided.] But most baffling of all in this odd, eerie house is the master, Mr. Knott himself. He is an absolute enigma whom Watt rarely even glimpses, and when he is occasionally seen for a brief moment, we are reminded of the castle-bureau crat Klamm in Kafka's The Castle, for, like the strange per sonage with whom K. has to deal, it seems impossible ever to be certain under what aspect Mr. Knott will present him self: sometimes he is fat and sometimes he is thin, on some occasions tall and at other times short. His face forever re mains indefinite; and we do not hear him speak. His gestures are awkward and erratic, and, for Watt, he is simply a tan talizing and not altogether unsinister question-mark. Indeed, Beckett's unheroic little hero exhausts every last ratiocina tive resource in an effort to figure things out. There is, for example, the bell which he hears in the night summoning Erskine, the other servant, to Mr. Knott's room. But is it Mr. Knott who presses the bell, and, if so, is it with his 167</page><page sequence="25">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW finger or his thumb or his nose or his toe or his elbow? It is with investigations into such questions as these that we are occupied through several pages—only for Watt finally to discover, after breaking into Erskine's room, that, though there is a bell in the room, it is broken. Or, again, there is the tantalizing mystery of how it is that the establishment manages to arrange for a famished dog to eat the remains of Mr. Knott's supper. Mr. Knott's meals al ways and unvaryingly consist of a single dish, a kind of soup which is prepared by numerous ingredients being mixed to gether and boiled in a pot: . . . fish, eggs, game, poultry, meat, cheese, fruit, all of various kinds, and of course bread and butter, and . . . the more usual beverages, such as absinthe, mineral water, tea, coffee, milk, stout, beer, whiskey, brandy, wine and water, and . . . many things... for the good of the health, such as insulin, digitalin, calomel, iodine, laudanum, mercury, coal, iron, camomille and worm-powder, and of course salt and mustard, pepper and sugar, and of course a little salicylic acid, to delay fermentation. We are told that "... Mr. Knott was never heard to complain of his food, though he did not always eat it." And, on those occasions when he left some portion of this brew in his bowl, Watt's instructions were to give the remains to a hungry dog. But, since there was no dog in the house, it was necessary, therefore, ". . . that a dog from outside should call at the house at least once every day, on the off chance of its being given part, or all, of Mr. Knott's lunch, or dinner, or both to eat." And in his effort to find a hypothesis that would ex plain the means whereby it could be guaranteed that a dog would always appear at the appropriate times, Watt is finally led to conceive of a family named Lynch, whose fantastically degenerate members are maintained by Mr. Knott through generation after generation, solely in order that they might provide the necessary dogs. It takes almost thirty pages for Watt to win some small measure of comprehension as to how it is that "the dog and the food . . . [are] brought together," and this is a statistic that is significant of the incredible lengths of tedium to which Beckett is willing to risk sub 168</page><page sequence="26">ZONE ZERO mitting his reader, in order fully to document the diligence with which his hero attempts to come to terms with the bizarre and extraordinary world of Mr. Knott. So it is no wonder that, faced as he is on all sides by what is ambiguous and undecipherable, Watt has to teach himself to live merely "among face values:" nor is it any wonder also that, under the pressure of the knotty ravelment of his situation, even his speech at last becomes shapeless and dis ordered: Most of day, part of night, now with Knott. Up till now, oh so little seen, or so little heard. From morning till night. This I heard, this I saw then what. Thing, dim, quiet. Now also failing, Ears, eyes. In hush, in mist, moved I so. ... Abandoned my little to find him. My little to learn him forgot. My little rejected to have. To love him my little reviled. This body homeless. This mind ignoring. These emptied hands. This emptied heart. To him I brought. To the temple. To the teacher. To the source. Of nought. Though he is aware of these "cracks" in his speech, he is "too tired to repair [them]," and the scene of his final collapse ap pears to be, as in the case of so many of Beckett's other heroes, an asylum for the insane. V At the end of the material which Beckett has appended to Watt—addenda whose incorporation into the novel was pre vented, he says, by "fatigue and disgust"—he wryly remarks, "no symbols where none intended." Which may indeed be his characteristically sardonic way of underlining the sym bolic intention. But though the tenuities of Murphy and Watt may make this kind of cryptic footnote necessary, it could perform no essential function in the novels that form the trilogy—Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable (written between 1951 and 1953). For the central characters in these books—and most especially Molloy—employ in their speech a kind of rhetoric which obviously wants to bear the full freight of "the human condition." This is not to say that Beckett's precise meanings are any more accessible here than in the earlier writings, for they are not: indeed, these 169</page><page sequence="27">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW books move towards an impatience with "literature" that is so severe as finally to make the art of fiction, as in The Un namable, an art of unintelligibly orchestrating the ultimate Silence. But, for all of the extravagant funambulism, these books are drenched in the imagery and language of contem porary existentialist nihilism. And though, as we inch our way along from page to page, their incredible tediousness converts the aesthetic transaction into a grim struggle on the part of the author to hang on to the reader's attention, they yet haunt us in memory, and their characters speak to us with a pathos, and at times an eloquence, rarely equalled in the A ng.V-ridden literature of modern alienation. When Molloy listens, "the voice is of a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky." "And," he says, "I hear it murmur that all wilts and yields, as if loaded down. . . . For what possible end to these wastes where true light never was, nor any upright thing, nor any true founda tion, but only these leaning things, forever lapsing and crumbling away, beneath a sky without memory of morning or hope of night." And when morning does come, he knows what he must do, for, as he says, "Morning is the time to hide." The entire trilogy might well have been called, by way of a general title, Portrait of the Artist in a World Collapsing, for this, we gradually discover, is what it is Beckett's inten tion to give us through the characters of Molloy and Moran and Malone and the Unnamable. Molloy, in his decrepitude and destitution, bears upon himself the hallmarks of the Beckett hero: he is old and crippled and bedridden and nearly blind. And we first meet him in his mother's room, where he is writing in bed. "There's this man who comes every week. Perhaps I got here thanks to him. He says not. He gives me money and takes away the pages. So many pages, so much money. . . . Yet I don't work for money. For what then? I don't know. The truth is I don't know much." But, in one of his essays on Beckett, Hugh Kenner has suggested that, given the fundamental logic of his fictional universe, the explanation of Molloy's literary activity may be regarded as 170</page><page sequence="28">ZONE ZERO gaining a kind of adumbration at least in a passage in Watt, where, in connection with the mystery of the dogs, we are told that: Not . . . for a moment [did] Watt . . . [suppose] that he had penetrated the forces at play, in this particular instance, or even perceived the forms that they upheaved, or obtained the least useful information concerning himself, or Mr. Knott, for he did not. But he had turned, little by little, a disturbance into words, he had made a pillow of old words, for a head. And this is, indeed, what the heroes of the trilogy are bent on doing—on turning, little by little, a deep and irremedi able disturbance into words. The narrative that Molloy is writing is by him intended to be an account of how, by bicycle and on foot, he came to this room: it had been, it appears, a grim and desperate jour ney in the course of which one leg became stiff, the toes of the foot of the other leg then falling off—so that, finally, he had to turn from the bicycle to his crutches, and then to crawling, being mysteriously rescued from complete im mobility in a ditch at the last. This harrowing Odyssey is paralleled in the second part of Molloy by a similar journey undertaken in search of Molloy by one Moran, who also starts out with a bicycle; but, after a time, his knees grow stiff, and then his legs become paralyzed—so that, in the end, he too must crawl or simply roll along inch by inch. And, when we meet him, Moran also has a pencil in his hand and is writing the story of his journey. Now we begin to get these two figures straight when we discover that the one is but the alter ego of the other. Like the hero of Kafka's The Trial, before his arrest, Moran too, before he is bidden by the mysterious Youdi to set out in search of Molloy, lives a meticulously ordered and self-con tained life, in a neat little cottage with his son and house keeper. He insists upon having his meals served on the clock's exact stroke of the appointed hour. And, after dinner, he enjoys a quiet nap in his bed. He most carefully tends the little garden behind his house. And he is scrupulous in per forming the religious observances ordained by his church. 171</page><page sequence="29">ZONE ZERO He is a man "patiently turned towards the outer world as towards the lesser evil, creature of his house, of his garden, of his few poor possessions." But amidst the tidiness and triviality of his little world, he has, from time to time, un easy intimations of a life within himself that is deeper and darker and less rational than that of the simple diurnal self with whom he customarily has dealings: indeed, sometimes he hears echoing within himself "a first syllable, Mol, very clear, followed almost at once by a second, very thick, as though gobbled by the first, and which might have been oy as it might have been ose, or one, or even oc." And, as Edith Kern has pointed out in her perceptive essay, it is significant that . . as Moran advances upon his road into the Molloy country, he slowly changes into that other self and comes to resemble Molloy." But what is perhaps most significant of all about Moran is that he is a writer: the record of his adventures which we read is a record of his own composition—which permits us then to regard him as Beckett's exemplum of the artist, of the man who turns a deep disturbance into words. And what is most significant about Molloy (that dimension of Moran's own selfhood for which he is searching) is that his is a life given over to searching for his mother's room—or, as Pro fessor Kern so acutely suggests, for those Mothers of Being who, according to Nietzsche, preside over "the innermost heart of things." So, then, in a time when the world is frozen and "all wilts and yields," the artist's turning (Molloy-Moran) must be to wards Mother's room, towards the dark and original source of Being: the journey there is difficult and dangerous, and, in his wanderings over and through the Mountains and Val leys of Primal Pain, he may be stripped of every security and racked by infinitely excruciating hurts and humiliations. But he smarts under none of this, for, as Heidegger says in his essay on Hölderlin: It is the time of the gods that have fled and of the god that is coming. It is the time of need, because it lies under a double 172</page><page sequence="30">ZONE ZERO lack and a double Not: the No-more of the gods that have fled and the Not-yet of the god that is coming. And in this time of breakdown and recrimination, journey ing and risk are the portion appointed him by his vocation. "Zero" is the terse reply that is spoken by Clov to Hamm in Endgame, when Hamm asks if there is anything on the hori zon. And when this is all that can be seen, the artist must seek to return into proximity to the Mothers of Being, there to await, with patience and cunning, some brave new world —and the book that he writes will be, like the jottings of Molloy and Moran, a record of how he did finally manage to arrive within the precincts of that original Room. The Malone of Malone Dies is but another phase or aspect of Molloy-Moran. In the first book of the trilogy we are shown the artist journeying back through the Wasteland into those primal precincts wherein alone he stands a chance of grasping the dilapidation and turning it into words; and, in the second book, we see him actually engaged in the creative process. Malone is somewhat nearer even to extinction than Molloy, and, as he lies paralyzed in his bed waiting for death, he writes in a notebook with the stub of a pencil sharpened at both ends, resolved to be "neither hot nor cold any more" —"I shall be tepid, I shall die tepid." He intends to tell three stories—one about a man and a woman, another "about an animal, a bird probably," and the third about a thing, "a stone probably." Then, having got through these, he will prepare an inventory of the few wretched possessions—an old hat, a crooked stick, one boot, etc.—that he has in his hos pital room; and, having done this, he will be finished. One suspects, though, that there could never be world enough and time for the completion of this project, and Malone does not live to finish even the first of the three stories which concerns a certain gentleman named Saposcat (generally referred to as Sapo [which is perhaps, as Hugh Kenner suggests, a diminutive form of homo sapiens]) and his wife who are anxious about the outcome of an examina tion which their son faces. In the course of the narrative, Sapo's name becomes Macmann (Son of man), and his *73</page><page sequence="31">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW picaresque adventures reenact the earlier misfortunes of Molloy and Moran. Like Watt, he ends his days in an in stitution for the insane: he is picked up one day, rolling in the rain, and taken to the asylum at Stillorgan, County Dub lin, where, in his old age, he senescently fumbles at sexual fun-games with Moll and is watched over by his keeper, Lemuel. But the main focus of the book is to be found far less in Sapo-Macmann than in Malone himself, his interest in Macmann's story being so intermittent as to permit him to leave out whole portions of it for the sake of making periodic notations on the steadily advancing deterioration of his own body—whose final expiration leaves the tale sus pended in mid-sentence. But till the emission of that last breath, agonized though he is both physically and spiritually, this insane and absolutely lucid genius never ceases to in vestigate and to chart the limitless void against whose sheer emptiness his life has been irremediably wrecked. Or at least he does not do so until a penultimate moment in which, imagining himself dealt a terrible blow by an unidentified presence, in a kind of raging fury against the universal dearth, he plunges the whole narrative into a blood bath, with Lemuel, the madhouse-keeper, hacking up some of the internes and shoving the rest out to sea. In The Unnamable we are hermetically sealed up within the absolute and self-contained world of the artist's imagina tion; and, whereas the hegemony of this world was to some extent broken in upon and invaded by the larger human universe in Molloy and Malone Dies, in the final novel of the trilogy it is utterly shut up and impermeable: so it is no wonder that of this book Beckett himself has said that it has brought him into "a situation that I can't extricate myself from." Of all the difficult and abstruse books that this Gallic Celt has written, this is perhaps the most difficult and the most exasperating, for all that we encounter is the discarnate imagination of the artist churning away, over the Void. "I am obliged to speak," says the Unnamable: "I shall never be silent. Never." And through almost two hundred pointless pages in which the last pretense at the invention of sustained 174</page><page sequence="32">ZONE ZERO narrative has been dropped this disembodied intelligence, dreaming its dream of absolute freedom and of absolute nothingness, speaks. "What was I going to say? Never mind, I'll say something else, it's all the same." Sometimes he won ders how it is that he goes on writing and what there is to write about. But, though he never achieves any clarity about these basic questions, he keeps on going, for about at least one thing he is in no doubt at all, and that is that he . . must go on . . . must say words, as long as there are any," for they, the words, may bring "me to the threshold of my story." So the voice is kept launched, and the authorial pen is kept moving, telling "the story of the silence" that is within the Unnamable and without: .. . the silence, full of murmurs, distant cries, the usual silence, spent listening, spent waiting, waiting for the voice, the cries abate, like all cries, that is to say they stop, the murmurs cease, they give up, the voice begins again, it begins trying again, quick now before there is none left, no voice left, nothing left but the core of murmurs, distant cries, quick now and try again, with the words that remain, try what, I don't know, I've forgotten, it doesn't matter, I never knew, to have them carry me into my story, the words that remain, my old story, which I've forgotten, far from here, through the noise, through the door, into the silence. . . . Indeed, says M. Mauriac: "We fall here . . . into absolute silence. ... By means of a literature that, by negating all literature, annihilates itself in the catastrophe it has created, Samuel Beckett, an exemplary alittérateur, opens a door in us which, even after Joyce and Kafka, might perhaps have re mained closed. . . . One cannot deny, at any rate, the ex traordinary impression, I dare not say of enrichment, since it concerns awareness of an absolute poverty, that Samuel Beckett creates. Poverty that is our only wealth. Inexhausti ble, fascinating poverty." VI Here, then, we have the major design of Beckett's fiction. And, briefly schematized, it might be said to entail a defini tion in Murphy and in Watt of his sense of the objective 175</page><page sequence="33">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW human situation, in all its hopelessness and abandonment and absurdity. Then, in the trilogy, as Kenner says: . . spiralling inward to the centre of . . . [his own] solitary world," the artist, in contemplating the processes of his own creativity, reaches the conclusion that, given the chaotic ab surdity of human existence, he is himself, as artist, his sole reliable datum: as the Unnamable puts it: All these Murphys, Molloys and Malones do not fool me. They have made me waste my time, suffer for nothing, speak of them when, in order to stop speaking, I should have spoken of me, am speaking of me. I don't care a curse what I just said. It is now I shall speak of me, for the first time. I thought I was right in enlisting these sufferers of my pains. I was wrong. They never suffered my pains, their pains are nothing, com pared to mine, a mere tittle of mine, the tittle I thought I could put from me, in order to witness it. Let them be gone now, them and all the others, those I have used and those I have not used, give me back the pains I lent them and vanish, from my life, my memory, my terrors and shames. There, now there is no one here but me, no one wheels about me, no one comes towards me, no one has ever met anyone before my eyes, these creatures have never been, only I and this black void have ever been. And the sounds? No, all is silent. The day, in other words, that is disclosed in these fictions is (as Hamm puts it in Endgame) "... an extra-ordinarily bitter day . . . zero by the thermometer." And this is the sense of existence that is exteriorized in Beckett's stage-pieces—in such works as Waiting for Godot (1952) and Endgame (1957) and the sketch for radio All That Fall (1957). They are all suffused with the purest nihilism and are appalling metaphors of what human life is like in the Zone of Zero, in the time of the absent God. They are bereft of the merest vestige of plot and action, and when, in Waiting for Godot, Estragon remarks: "Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!" he summarizes the whole of Beckett's theatre. In Waiting for Godot, for ex ample, two Chaplinesque hobos simply wait under a tree on an untravelled heath for someone called Godot, who never arrives. And though the prefix of this name has en couraged some of Beckett's critics to interpret the play 176</page><page sequence="34">ZONE ZERO theistically, we ought perhaps to remember the passage in Molloy—in which the protagonist tells us that he called his mother Mag because, he says, "the letter 'g' abolished the syllable ma"—and, similarly, the suffix ot (with its heavy aural implications of naughting scepticism) may be intended to negate God, as the actual content of the play would cer tainly lead us to suppose. Or, again, in Endgame, we are in an unfurnished room suffused with a gray light, with two small windows too high up to be seen through; and in this room there are four grotesques. Magg and Nell are two leg less ancients who occasionally poke up their heads from the ashcans in which they are confined to ask for their pap and sugar plums. Hamm, their blind son, is an invalid whose station is a wheel chair, and there he remains throughout the play, stanching his wounds with a bloody handkerchief and, from time to time, irascibly demanding his dose of "pain-killer" from Clov, his adopted son and attendant, who, despite his game legs, is the sole member of the quartet who is able to hobble about the room. When Clov climbs up his ladder to peer out one of the windows through his telescope, he reports to Hamm that "All is Zero." And when Hamm petulantly asks, as he often does: "What's happening, what's happening?" Clov's unvarying answer is: "Something is tak ing its course." But Hamm has no illusions about the provi dential beneficence of this unfoldment, whatever it is of, for, as to God, he says: "The bastard doesn't exist." So they sim ply sit there in the "infinite emptiness," watching their "light dying," abusing each other, telling their bitter jokes (about the tailor, for example, who, when asked by an irate customer why he couldn't make a pair of trousers in three months when God made the world in six days, replied: "But my dear Sir, my dear Sir, look—at the world—and look—at my TROU SERS!"), and reminding themselves of the hopelessness of their condition. "Outside of here," says Hamm, "it's death," and we are reminded of Vladimir's word to Estragon in Godot: "There's no way out. . . ."—as we are also reminded of that claustral Second Empire living-room in Sartre's No Exit which is Hell. 177</page><page sequence="35">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW I have already referred to that passage in Watt in which the protagonist worries over the meaning of the visit paid to Mr. Knott's house by the Galls, the piano-tuners, and I am put in mind of it again, as our circle begins now to be com pleted. For, among the many reverberations in us that Mr. Beckett's writings release, there is a certain particular reson ance that this passage has which makes us feel that here perhaps is a clue to the primary intention that executively controls the entire oeuvre. Watt, it will be recalled, as he contemplates the fact that the piano-tuners simply came and then left, is troubled by "the utmost formal distinctness" with which "nothing had happenedhe is not yet an adept, says Beckett, in the art of eliciting "something from noth ing." But this, he goes on to imply, is precisely the challenge that faces the human intelligence, of learning how to elicit something from le Néant. And is not this, we may now wonder, precisely the end to which his whole effort as an artist is de voted—the elicitation, that is, with "the utmost formal dis tinctness," of some little something from the great environing Nothingness that perpetually threatens to smother us out? Beckett reminds us, of course, that: . . . the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way one can speak of God is to speak of him as though he were a man, which to be sure he was, in a sense, for a time, and as the only way one can speak of man, even our anthropologists have realised that, is to speak of him as though he were a termite. And this is, indeed, just what he seems to have tried to do in book after book, to speak of man, yes, but to speak of him in such a way that we shall know, through all the images and metaphors of illness and senescence and decay, that Man is nothing, and that Man is nothing because there is Nothing either in or beyond existence that sanctions or gives any kind of warrant or dignity to the human enterprise. Indeed, the nihilism of this writer is not only present in the images and situations which he selects as the vehicles of his mean ing but is operative even in the nervous rhythms of his sen tences. In one of the most acute observations that any of his 178</page><page sequence="36">ZONE ZERO readers have made, Miss Christine Brooke-Rose has noticed how frequently the word not is to be heard throughout his work, "like a constant echo:" "Not that Watt was ever to have any direct dealings with Mr. Knott, for he was not" or "Not that many things remain to be said, on the subject of the Galls father and son, for they do not" or "Not that the garden was so little, for it was not," etc. This is the language, as Miss Brooke-Rose puts it, of one who is "the poet of le Néant" and, his spiritual residence being in that cheerless and unpromising Zone of Zero, it is the language of one who distrusts and despairs of literature, since to work within any form is always to run the risk of coming to believe in some thing rather than nothing, at least in something sufficient enough to give a kind of existential accreditation to literary form itself. But not even intending to relax his nihilism to this minimal extent, Beckett's is, therefore, she says, a poetry determinedly formless and stammering, full of ". . . slightly surrealistic tricks, [of] the things which are and are not, [of] the detailed and serious treatment of pointless incidents, [of] the introduction of characters in a familiar tone, whom we are supposed to know, and who never reappear." It is, in other words, a literature uninformed by any faith in litera ture itself, and Mr. Beckett's profound scepticism about the Word and about Mythos is, at bottom, rooted in a profound despair of Logos, of the possibility of any system of meaning being able to introduce any kind of ultimately valid and satisfactory order into a universe in which "the bastard doesn't exist." One is also struck by the remarkable absence of any kind of piety in Beckett's books. Amidst all the broken furniture of the world and amidst all the maimed and stunted grotesques who masquerade as men, there is nothing that commends itself as deserving of reverence, of honor, or even of respect: the human scene, like that in the novels of Céline (with whom Stephen Spender is right in thinking Beckett deserves more to be compared than with Kafka or Joyce), is always nasty and brutish and hateful and absurd. The light is always dying, and the temperature is always Zero. 179</page><page sequence="37">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW So one wonders how appropriate it is, in this particular ambiance, to contemplate the possibility of "grace at zero point." A good deal has been said (outside the contexts of literary criticism) by Christian writers in recent years, par ticularly on the European scene, about "grace at zero point." And this is a kind of witness which it is by no means im proper to recall in this present context, since, given the ac tualities of our culture, it is impossible for agnosticism to go as deep as Beckett's without its becoming involved in polemic against Christian premises. But, now, when Christian the ologians like Karl Barth or the late Dietrich Bonhoeffer speak of "grace at zero point," they have in mind the possibilities for radically new beginnings that come into existence when, by some extreme and thoroughgoing crisis, the life of men is so stripped of every proximate and spurious security as to compel them to submit to the cleansing processes of judg ment and to rebuild their life on some fresh and new struc ture of meaning that is given of God. And, unquestionably, the austere tragic vision in much of the great literature of our period has had the effect, as Amos Wilder has remarked, of saying to men: You must change your life! Such art represents a demand, even a rebuke. It sees through us.... There is an interesting analogy between the surgical acerbity of much modern art and the in exorable sobriety of neo-orthodox theology. In any case, the modern writer challenges men to revise their mood and atti tude. He says that cherished decorums are misconceived, and that cherished securities are not enough. And thus it is that, despite the various ways in which the au thors of The Castle, The Sound and the Fury, The Old Man and the Sea, and The Plague bring us to a kind of "zero point," it is, nevertheless, a point at which new beginnings are in view and a point to which, therefore, those who live in traditional communities of religious faith had better make a journey, if their certitudes are not to lapse into irrelevant banality. In the writings of his last years, Dietrich Bonhoeffer liked to tell us that "... now that it has come of age, the world is 180</page><page sequence="38">ZONE ZERO more godless, and perhaps it is for that very reason nearer to God than ever before." But, as one of his recent interpreters has reminded us, he was not himself intending to sponsor or to promote the world's godlessness but was, rather, attempt ing only to elicit from us the recognition that the godlessness of contemporary agnosticism is very often a profoundly "hopeful godlessness" and therefore points beyond itself to fresh redintegration. And it is indeed just here that we may see the tremendous difference between a Camus, say, and a Beckett. For, though both are situated within the perspec tives of modern secular existentialism, the godlessness of a Camus is a profoundly hopeful godlessness, whereas that of Beckett is soured and bitter and utterly hopeless. Erich Heller says of Kafka that ". . . he knows two things at once, and both with equal assurance: that there is no God, and that there must be God." But Samuel Beckett is in that line of contemporary writers—Nathanael West, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Eugene Ionesco—who not only begin at Zero but who stick to Zero. And at this point—no grace, but only the sound of "... a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky. . . . And ... all wilts and yields." l8l</page></plain_text>
