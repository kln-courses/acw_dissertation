<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophical Problems of Space and Time, second, enlarged edi- tion. ADOLPH GRUNBAUM. Dordrecht: Reidel, 1973. xxiii, 884 p. Cloth $46.00, paper $17.90. This immense volume, published as volume XII of the Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, stands as the culmination of Grtinbaum's decades-long work, binding together a number of ele- ments most of which have appeared, either in their present form but sometimes in abbreviated versions, elsewhere. Chapters 1-15 are a reprint (with some typographical correc- tions) of the first edition of this work. Chapter 16 (reprinted from Philosophy of Science) is a response to critical examinations of Griinbaum's notions of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics and of the notion of alternative metrizability. Chapter 17 (reprinted from Mandelbaum's Observation and Theory in Science) discusses the falsifiability of scientific hypotheses. Chapter 18 (British Journal for the Philosophy of Science) considers the question of whether or not an infinitude of operations can be performed in a finite time. Chapter 19 (written for a Festschrift for Henry Margenau edited by Laszlo and Sellon but not yet in print) examines the question of the physical objectivity of the notion of entropy. Chap- ter 20 (Philosophy in Science) is on slow clock transport and simul- taneity in relativity. Chapter 21 (appearing in somewhat different form in Science) discusses the interrelations between history and philosophy of science. Chapter 22 (which appeared in abbreviated form in this JOURNAL) is on geometrodynamics. Finally capping all is a long appendix commenting section by section on the first edition and designed to compensate for the fact that the reproduction process required publication of that section of this book with only minor changes. Since the core of this book, the first edition of Philosophical Problems of Space and Time, has received as much attention in the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 495 journals as any work of a living philosopher, I will devote the brief space of this review to surveying and commenting on some of the major aspects of three of the chapters that constitute the present enlargement of the original text. CHAPTER i6 This is the central section of this new edition. In it Grtinbaum elaborates at very great length and with an enormous wealth of technical detail the notion that the metric features of a space-time are "extrinsic" to the space-time and, hence, "conventional." The essay is intended both to expound in full detail the various notions of intrinsicness and extrinsicness, ontological dependency, conven- tionality and nonconventionality, etc. crucial to Griinbaum's well- known thesis about metric aspects of space-time and, in passing, to reply to many of the critics who have challenged Griinbaum's doc- trines both on general philosophical grounds and in matters of detail. The claim is, as before, that certain features of a space-time are "intrinsic" to its very nature. The existence of these features de- pends only upon the existence of the space-time and its elements themselves. The topological features of a space-time are among its intrinsic features. Were we able to construe the metric on a space- time in terms of these intrinsic features, as Griinbaum alleges we are able to do in a discrete space in terms of the cardinality of a set of points (taken to be an intrinsic feature), or by some other means (Griinbaum's favorite example being a metric on the reals as the numerical difference in the value of each real, this, surely, being an intrinsic feature of the real number), then the metric would be intrinsic to the space-time and hence nonconventional. But, Griinbaum argues, in a continuum we can't topologically define the metric, and, it appears to him, no other intrinsic feature will do to fix the metric aspects either. He says he has no deductive proof that such an intrinsic characterization is impossible, but that it seems to him inductively well established. So, to invoke a metric we must introduce some new elements whose being goes beyond the being of the space-time and its elements themselves, say rigid rods and clocks. The metric features of space-time are then "onto- logically dependent" on such entities, are extrinsic to the space- time itself, and are, hence, merely matters of convention. While many details of the Griinbaumian thesis are indeed clari- fied by this elaborate and careful self-exigesis, this reviewer still finds himself puzzled by the asymmetrical attribution of topologi-</page><page sequence="3">496 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY cal aspects of space-time to the space-time itself combined with the refusal to take metric aspects as themselves primitive aspects of the appropriate space-time entities. There are, of course, familiar epis- temologically based arguments for taking space-time itself as a "fiction," holding only material objects as real, and viewing spatio- temporal relations among them as exhausting the ontology of spacetime. And there are the further epistemologically based argu- ments which take coincidence or, at most, local spatiotemporal re- lations among material objects as real and all other relationships as stipulative. These arguments are controversial, to say the least. But they are arguments and of a familiar philosophical sort. Yet I am still at a loss to grasp the fundamental rationale behind the Riemann-Weyl-Griinbaum intuition which for some other reason (Griinbaum continually distinguishes his position from the more familiar one based on epistemological considerations) takes topol- ogy as part of the space-time itself but refuses to so take metric features. It does seem to this reviewer that at crucial points the epistemological argument is invoked. What grounds do we have for invoking the necessity of rigid rods et al. in comparing the lengths of separated intervals other than the familiar view that without them we have no epistemic access to the comparison? Otherwise why not simply say that some separated intervals are congruent and others not, and that is just the fact of the matter, no matter how we may or may not find it out? And why should the dependence of the metric in its existence on non- spatiotemporal entities, if such dependence there be, be taken as a mark of conventionality were it not for the familiar arguments con- cerning alternative ways of saving the epistemically directly acces- sible phenomena? CHAPTER I9 Grtinbaum is concerned with the claim that entropy and entropic changes are relative to human "ignorance" of the micro details of a system or human "decisions" about how to view or describe the system. Wigner and Jaynes have called entropy "anthropomorphic" -an unfortunate locution but one whose import is fairly clear. Wigner and Jaynes had meant this in the sense that the entropy of a system is relative to our level of description of it in terms of thermodynamic "degrees of freedom." This is not fundamentally a statistical relativization. Griinbaum, rather, is concerned with the allegation that the (Boltzmann) coarse-grained entropy is relative to the choice of coarse-graining of the molecular phase-space and,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 497 hence, that whether or not entropy increases in a system as time goes on is so relative and not an "objective" fact about the system in the world. Griinbaum believes this objectivity essential, for an "anthropomorphic" entropy would be "incapable of a role in phys- ically undergirding time's arrow." Griinbaum argues that, although it is clear that for a given sys- tem in a given initial micro-state there will be coarse-graining parti- tions relative to which its coarse-grained entropy respectively in- creases, decreases, and remains the same, this is not inconsistent with the following "fundamental presumed fact" about a finite ensemble of systems U: "For any and every partition, the common initial entropy of all the systems in U will have either increased in a vast majority M of the systems by the time t + At, or it will have remained the same. The substitution of one partition for another affects only the membership of M while leaving the specified parti- tion-invariance of the entropy statistics intact." But the "fundamental fact" is not a fact at all. For any finite ensemble U we can, surely, by following the detailed microscopic motion of the phases, construct at least one coarse-graining of the molecular phase-space relative to which the entropy of a majority (indeed all) the members of U decreases. The "presumed funda- mental fact" is indeed consistent with the relativization of entropy change for a given system to the partition chosen, but it is still not a fact. More fundamentally, a whole host of questions needs to be asked: What is the right phenomenological notion of entropy to introduce when offering an entropic theory of the "direction of time"? What is the right statistical notion of entropy to invoke? Surely not the Boltzmann entropy here discussed, for it doesn't even give the correct phenomenological entropy except for ideal gases. Should we use the Gibbs fine-grained entropy, and restrict our attention to initial and final equilibrium states, as Jaynes maintains? Should we use a Gibbs coarse-grained entropy? If so how should we partition the system phase-space? Is the relativiza- tion to partitioning which then results in any way undesirable? Why shouldn't entropy be so relativized? Or, instead, is there a notion of entropy applicable to nonequilibrium states which re- quires no coarse-graining, as Prigogine's school seems to suggest? The entropic theory of the direction of time, hinted at by Boltz- mann, developed in great detail by Reichenbach, and reflected on in important ways by Griinbaum, Costa de Beauregard, and others</page><page sequence="5">498 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is certainly one of the most fascinating developments of the philos- ophy of physics. We need, however, to know a great deal more about the foundations of statistical mechanics and, perhaps more importantly, about the structure of the entropic theory as a philo- sophical theory before we can soundly evaluate the plausibility of this philosophical account of the "direction of time." For example, given the aims of the theory, is it at all clear that an "entropy" that was specifiable relative only to human knowledge and human descriptions of the system would be inappropriate for playing the crucial role in a theory of the direction of time? Given one of the aims of that theory, finding the source in the world of our human "intuition" that time is asymmetrical, might not such an "anthro- pomorphic" entropy serve us perfectly well? CHAPTER 22 The bulk of this section is devoted to the philosophical aspects of Wheelerian geometrodynamics in which one takes space-time itself as the "super-substance" out of which all ordinary substances are "constructed." First Grfinbaum discussed various methods that have been pro- posed (rods and clocks, Synge's chronometric method, the methods of null- and time-like geodesics as represented by paths of light rays and free particles) for mapping out the metric of space-time. Grun- baum correctly claims that the third method is as infected with "conventionalism" as the first. Next he argues with some plausibility that geometrodynamics seems incompatible with the view that the metric structures of space-time are conventional. I think that here we have just a spe- cial instance of the general thesis that, whereas relationism hardly implies conventionalism, the view that a structure is merely a matter of convention seems to eliminate the possibility of our treat- ing it realistically. The bulk of the section, however, is taken up with an attempt to refute Glymour's claim that one could hold to a realistic theory of space-time curvature without being realistic about the metric aspects of space-time since curvature is fixed by the affine structure, which is, as is well known, independent of even the existence of a metric aspect to the space-time. Given Griinbaum's earlier dis- cussion of the conventionality of the geodesic method, in this sec- tion one might think that he could be easily satisfied in reply to this claim with the remark that the projective and conformal struc- tures "imposed" on space-time are as "conventional" as the metric</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 499 structures. Instead Griinbaum proceeds to argue at great length that some aspects of what one might call curvature (sectional curva- tures, covariant Riemann tensor) imply a metric structure even if other things one might call aspects of curvature (geodesic structure, mixed Riemann tensor) don't. He is also much concerned to show that Clifford certainly and Wheeler probably (if Grtinbaum's inter- pretation of some of his remarks is correct) seem to hold incon- sistently the view that space-time is the fundamental stuff of the world, with "real" metric aspects, and yet that the metric of space- time is (conventionally) imposed upon it by us. As usual Griinbaum interprets this last to mean an "ontological" dependence of the metric on the existence of nonspatiotemporal entities (rods, clocks, et al.). Though a number of quite interesting points are made here, one has the feeling that, perhaps, the trees have got more attention than the forest. Why, again, does Grfinbaum continually single out the metric structure of space-time as conventional-in his sense mean- ing "ontologically dependent?" Why should we take topology (and, perhaps, conformal and projective structure as well?) as "intrinsic?' to space-time but maintain that the metric is "imposed" by us and somehow not a feature of the space-time itself? Does anything sup- port this asymmetrical attitude other than the "intuitions" of Riemann and Weyl? There are, once again, epistemologically moti- vated arguments for taking all space-time features as "conventional" (as opposed to features of ordinary material objects). These are the most persuasive arguments behind Leibnizian relationism. And, once again, there are similar arguments which would place all nonlocal aspects in the realm of the conventional, reserving for locally determinable features the sole status as elements of reality. These are the intuitions behind Poincarean conventionalism and its Eddington-Schlick-Reichenbach transformation to a reductionist account of space-time. But why try to draw a line either between topological and all other aspects, or between all other aspects and metric, as a line dividing the real from the conventional? Though I am quite sympathetic to Griinbaum's claim that one can't be conventionalist about an aspect of space-time and yet take that aspect to be a fundamental ontological reality, is it so clear that one can't be a "conventionalist" and yet espouse something like a geometrodynamic theory? What about a position like the following: Suppose one takes all statements about physical objects to be a con-</page><page sequence="7">500 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ventional superstructure imposed over a reality of immediately sensed perceptual contents. Then one might be a geometrodynam- icist still, in the sense that one thinks that one need only talk "as if" one such "theoretical" element-space-time itself-and its struc- tures were real, identifying all ordinary matter with such structured space-time. Of course "space-time itself" is then no more real than rods and clocks would be. I don't think this is or was Wheeler's view, but it would be a position that reconciled conventionalism with regard to all space-time structures with geometrodynamics as believed fundamental physical theory. Over-all, the new additions to the basic text reveal once more Griinbaum's intense dedication to the fundamental problems of the philosophy of space and time, his careful and thorough pursuit of each and every detail essential to his over-all program, and his astonishing breadth of learning in the literature both of philosophy and physics. Those who are sympathetic with Grtinbaum's over-all approach will find the new contributions notable additions to the heroic defense of the fundamental thesis about space and time Griinbaum espouses and to his over-all methodological stance that various philosophical doctrines, like that of the conventionality of the metric, are part and parcel of the empirical science of space-time. Those who are dubious of the over-all approach will still find the material stimulating and informative throughout and a close read- ing of it essential in getting their own alternative positions clarified.
