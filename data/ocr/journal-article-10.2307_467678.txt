<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard Wright's Unpublished Haiku: A World Elsewhere Floyd Ogburn, Jr. University of Cincinnati Approximately fourteen months before his death in Paris, France, in November 1960, Richard Wright completed 4,000 haiku. After painstakingly reworking the poems, he produced an 82-page manu- script entitled This Other World: Projections in the Haiku Manner and sent it to William Targ of World Publishing. Adeptly balancing the manuscript's merits and faults in a letter to Wright on July 6, 1960, Targ discourages publication, maintaining that "a fine little book could be produced from a careful selection; but frankly, I don't have the courage to undertake such a publication, publishable though it be. Commercially speaking it simply would not get off the ground. In a limited, deluxe edition, it would perhaps reach the aficionado and the truly dedicated reader-buyer of poetry. But this is not enough for our needs."1 Unfortunately and surprisingly, This Other World remains unpub- lished, even though it demonstrates an extraordinary endeavor by Wright to fulfill himself and his world as a writer and contains many masterfully conceived haiku. Equally surprising, only four scholars have written serious studies of the haiku, although 23 poems have been published since 1978, and all 4,000 have been available at the Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library since 1976.2 Of these four studies, only two have examined the unpublished manuscripts. Yet the unpublished poems, it seems to me, invite a re- evaluation of the shape of Wright's corpus. Not only do they provide graphic and mature illustrations of Wright's early work on poetics, they also depart dramatically from the poetics of his mid-career. Published in 1937, "Blueprint for Negro Writing" offers an early description of Wright's poetics, particularly his sense of the perspec- tive and theme of the African American writer, his understanding of the basis and meaning of nationalism in African American writing, and his belief in the role of the writer as creator.

This essay argues, therefore, that the critical theory evident in these three texts becomes derailed in Wright's mid-career and is not fully realized until This Other World. Indeed, it is only after Wright en- counters certain tenets of haiku and Zen Buddhism that he can return to and fully realize his early poetics; Zen and haiku give him the cru- cial formulations that had escaped his early efforts. In addition, this essay will devote especial attention to Wright's composing process in This Other World, for it is through observing Wright's meticulous composing process that one begins to understand his attempts to re- fine his poetics and his new world-to step beyond the naturalism and existentialism of mid-career. To the best of my knowledge, no other study has examined these unpublished manuscripts as carefully. Having some reference to the season, the haiku's primary purpose is to express the poet's union with nature, the "flash of intuition con- cerning the objects which his senses perceive" (Giroux 23). In brief, a haiku-a poem of meaningful touch, taste, sound, sight, and smell- is a moment of vision, derived, as R. H. Blyth instructs us, through the senses (History of Haiku 1: 28).3 One of the great haiku masters, Masaoka Shiki, is credited with in- venting the term "haiku" in an essay entitled "Haikai and Haiku," written in 1889, and with the development of the haiku as an inde- pendent poetic form (Yasuda 111-12). Regarding the genesis of haiku, there is some dispute. Joan Giroux, for instance, suggests that the haiku poem is derived from the first three lines of two fairly conven- tional Japanese verse forms: waka (five lines arranged in sequence of 5-7-5-7-7) and renga (a poetic dialogue or linked "waka in which the first three lines of 5-7-5 syllables are composed by one person, the two lines of 7-7 by another person, the following three lines 5-7-5 by a third person, and so on," (15-16). Kenneth Yasuda concludes how- ever that haiku poetry embodies some of the "most fundamental mo- tivations" of Japanese poetry and therefore predates renga (112). He traces haiku to the greetings exchanged by the deities Izanagi and Izanami in the Nihonshoki, an early 8th century Japanese imperial an- thology. The greetings-each one consisting of an exclamatory ques- tion and an answer-comprise the basis of katauta, a poetic form which may have origins in the spring festivals and fertility rites of primitive cultures. The syllabic pattern of katauta-5-7-7 or 5-7-5- presages that of haiku. After undergoing several metamorphoses, the katuata form eventuates in the haiku. Katauta and haiku therefore constitute the basic poetic unit in Japanese poetry (109-12). Although students of haiku disagree regarding its genesis, they concur that Matsuo Basho (1644-1694), Taniguchi Buson (1715-1783), and 58</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU Kobayashi Issa (1763-1827) join Shiki as the undisputed developers and masters of the form (Blyth, Haiku 1: 328-50). Zen Buddhism "illuminates" the thoughts of the haiku masters and other haiku poets and "provides the essential key to the meaning of many haiku" (Giroux 44). Central to Zen is the notion that "through meditation one could attain satori (enlightenment), intu- itive insight into what transcends logical distinctions" (Giroux 36). Satori provides a new perspective on the ordinary things of life: it finds meaning hidden in our daily concrete experiences (Suzuki 30). It is moral, spiritual, and intellectual emancipation (Suzuki 31). Re- vealing a new world hitherto unperceived, satori is "'intuitive look- ing-into, in contra-distinction to intellectual and logical understand- ing"' (Giroux 43). Meditating on koan paradoxes facilitates achieving satori, but the koan can be solved only by dispelling logic and the dis- tractions found in books (Giroux 36). In haiku poetry, the haiku moment, as Yasuda has called it, draws heavily upon the satori of Zen. The haiku moment is an aesthetic mo- ment-one in which the words which create the experience and the experience itself are one. Anti-temporal and eternal, the haiku mo- ment culminates "in a new insight or vision which the poet must ren- der as an organic whole" (Yasuda 24-25). Both satori and the haiku moment conjoin the similar and disparate in unorthodox ways in or- der to reveal that which is significant. Thus, directness (an aversion to symbol and metaphor) is linked with paradox (the seemingly ab- surd, yet true), austerity (detachment, simplicity in life and language) with joy (the sensation engendered by austerity), and love of nature (an intense but unsentimental feeling) with love of the ordinary (in- sects or daily duties such as eating and sleeping) (Giroux 45-67). As the haiku poets express newly perceived sensations or sudden awarenesses of the meaning of some common human experience of nature, they must exclude intellectual and moral elements. The Japanese reader, comments Blyth, rejects intellectual components as "not haiku" instinctively and moral elements as being generalities (History of Haiku 1: 11-12). However, if it ornaments pure sensation- the meaning and essence of haiku-religion, philosophy, morality, romance, or superstition is permissible (History of Haiku 2: xxxi). As Margaret Walker tells us, Wright loved and read modern poet- ry with a passion. Ezra Pound-whose Imagist movement early in this century was influenced by haiku-was one of the many mod- ernist poets whom Wright read frequently (313). Yet Wright's interest in and study of haiku came not from the American Imagists. In fact, Michel Fabre's study of Wright's library and readings reveals that Wright did not own any of the works of Ezra Pound, Carl Sandburg, 59</page><page sequence="4">FLOYD OGBURN William Carlos Williams, Amy Lowell, Wallace Stevens, Arthur Davison Ficke, John Gould Fletcher, Hilda Doolittle, or Yvor Winters, all of whom at one time or another experimented with imagistic po- etry (Richard Wright: Books and Writers). It appears that Wright's study of haiku began in 1959 on the advice of a young South African friend who loved haiku and described it to Wright.4 Fascinated by what he had learned from his friend, Wright borrowed and studied R. H. Blyth's Haiku, a work of four volumes. Just how carefully Wright imitated the Japanese masters as they are depicted in Blyth is debated by critics. While it is clear that Wright carefully tried to respect "the exact form of haiku-three unrhymed lines composed respectively" of 5, 7, 5 syllables, to "condense the essence of the poem in the first two lines," and to "include an implic- it or explicit reference to the chosen season of the year," his adherence to other central tenets of seventeenth and eighteenth century Japan- ese haiku is perhaps not so clear (Fabre, Unfinished Quest 505-06). Ar- guing that Wright departed significantly from the traditions of seven- teenth and eighteenth century Japanese haiku poets and consequent- ly did not achieve the "serene mastery" of the form, Robert Tener, for instance, concludes that most of Wright's published haiku fail be- cause they are too symbolic and metaphorical, too anthropomorphic, too sentimental and nostalgic. Tener also suggests that the poems fail to accept life with the loss of personal identity and contain intrusive poet-speakers (289-93). Tener's conclusion, it appears to me, is rather strange for a couple of reasons. In several instances the problems with black-white sym- bolism-and even anthropomorphism-may lie with the way he is reading the poems, not with Wright's intent and craft: "Standing in the field / I hear the whispering of / Snowflake to snowflake" or "In the falling snow / A laughing boy holds out his palms / Until they are white" (Wright, "Haikus" 252-53). Tener implies that both poems are concerned primarily with race. Yet in the second working draft of This Other World, Wright assigns "Standing in the field" the classifica- tion of "religion," suggesting that his aim is far more complex than black-white race relations. And while "In the falling snow" is not classified in the second working draft, one does not have to conclude that the "laughing boy" is black. Also, Tener's conclusion is puzzling because discussions about mastery of form grounded in the examina- tion of only 23 of 4,000 poems seem premature. As early as 1926 in Memphis, Tennessee, Wright showed signs of his lifelong tendency to extract from authors their perspectives or points of view while rejecting their "plots and stories." In fact, he dis- carded a writer as soon as he had grasped the writer's point of view. 60</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU When he read a work, he gave himself over to it "without reserve, without trying to criticize it; it was enough for me to see and feel something different" (Black Boy 294-97). Given Wright's tendency to focus on point of view rather than technique, it makes little sense to expect him to "master" the poetic form and features of Japanese haiku. In all probability, his goal when reading Blyth was to compre- hend the perspective of Zen Buddhism and of Japanese haiku, to take from them ideas to help him "see and feel something different." Thus, his "haiku should be analyzed in the light of his own poetics, rather than be compared to the Japanese poems he used as models" (Miller 246). Originally appearing in New Challenge (Fall 1937) five years before his break with the Communist Party, "Blueprint for Negro Writing" in one sense "represents Wright's attempt, as a Black Communist, to explore the relationship between literature and politics as well as that between class perspective and ethnic culture" (Wright and Fabre In- troduction. Richard Wright Reader 36). In another, perhaps more pro- found sense, "Blueprint" represents Wright's efforts to step beyond the limited vision of communism in order to define for African Amer- ican writers their role in society, the perspective they should culti- vate, and the themes they should pursue. And it is in the latter sense that Wright begins to sow the seeds of haiku. Wright begins "Blueprint" by lamenting African American writers' failure "as creative writers" to take advantage of their "unique mi- nority position," lagging far behind the initiatives of their people for freedom. The "hiatus" between African American writers and their people, argues Wright, can only be bridged when African American writers reclaim their role as creators/builders, viewing "society as something becoming rather than as something fixed and admired" (39). With the dissolution of the "Negro church" and the "increasing irresolution" of the "Negro middle class leadership," the African American writer "is being called upon to do no less than create val- ues by which his race " is to live and die (43). As creators, "Negro writers" have the ability "to fuse and make articulate" disparate ex- periences, to "create the myths and symbols that inspire a faith in life" (43). As creators, "Negro writers" must "create a meaningful picture of the world" from the "materials and experiences" of their own lives in ways hitherto unperceived (44). Wright realizes that the role of creator is inexorably connected to perspective or vision: What vision must Negro writers have before their eyes in order to feel the impelling necessity for an about face? What angle of vision can 61</page><page sequence="6">FLOYD OGBURN show them all the forces of modern society in process, all the lines of economic development converging toward a distant point of hope? Must they believe in some 'ism'? ("Blueprint" 45) While Marxism can restore to "Negro writers" their lost heritage- their role as creators of the world in which they live and creators of themselves-it "is but the starting point": "After Marxism has laid bare the skeleton of society, there remains the task of the writer to plant flesh upon those bones out of his will to live" (44). Though the presentation of the lives of their people should be simple, the "Negro Writers"' vision should not be simple. It should present "all the com- plexity, the strangeness, the magic wonder of life that plays like a bright sheen over the most sordid existence"; it should have a complex simplicity, perceiving new significance/connections among the ordi- nary and disparate: Perspective for Negro writers will come when they have looked and brooded so hard and long upon the harsh lot of their race and com- pared it with the hopes and struggles of minority peoples everywhere that the cold facts have begun to tell them something. (46) Acknowledging that perspective is elusive, Wright proffers the fol- lowing definition: Perspective is that part of a poem, novel, or play which a writer never puts directly upon paper. It is that fixed point in intellectual space where a writer stands to view the struggles, hopes, and sufferings of his people. There are times when he may stand too close and the result is a blurred vision. Or he may stand too far away and the result is a ne- glect of important things. (45) At its best, perspective, Wright adds, is a pre-conscious assumption, something taken for granted, or something won through living. Sig- nificantly, he concludes this point in the essay by employing an exam- ple to illustrate that above all perspective is the ability to divine con- nections among things that on the surface appear totally dissimilar: It [perspective] means that a Negro writer must create in his readers' minds a relationship between a Negro woman hoeing cotton in the South and the men who loll in swivel chairs in Wall Street and take the fruits of her toil. (46) To a large extent, "Negro nationalism" at this point in his artistic career provides Wright a perspective that he finds palatable. He con- tends that the nationalistic character of "Negro people" is unmistak- 62</page><page sequence="7">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU ably evident in the whole of their culture, particularly in folklore, which is derived from "a unified sense of a common life and a com- mon fate" (41). And it is the tendency of nationalism to stress unity, a "consciousness of the interdependence of people in modern society," and self-possession that so intrigues Wright. He makes clear that by adopting a nationalistic perspective, he is not propagating "a spe- cious and blatant nationalism" or "'black chauvinism."' Prefiguring his later interest in haiku, Wright retreats to nature and to botanical metaphors to pinpoint the origin of nationalism, to clarify some of its weaknesses, and to state its promise. He says that nationalism em- anates from "the reflex expression of a life whose roots are embedded deeply in Southern soil" (42). He contends later that a few "stunted plants of Negro nationalism grow" from the "stony soil of aggran- dizement," but that "Negro writers can help to weed out these chok- ing growths of reactionary nationalism and replace them with hardier and sturdier types" (49). Acknowledging that nationalism has "limitations" and inherent dangers, Wright finally perceives it as a kind of interim-perspective, one that African American writers should possess and understand, then transcend-one that empowers them to realize within their own personal experiences those impulses which connect to the experiences of others (43). Given this perspective, the African American writer's theme should do more than render the social scene. It should embrace and make meaning of the "whole" of African American culture. Wright believes that "Sense of theme will emerge in Negro writing when Ne- gro writers try to fix this story [of African American life] about some pole of meaning, remembering as they do so that in the creative process meaning proceeds equally as much from the contemplation of the subject matter as from the hopes and apprehensions that rage in the heart of the writer" (47). Put another way, "Theme for Negro writ- ers will emerge when they have begun to feel the meaning of the his- tory of their race as though they in one life time had lived it them- selves throughout all the long centuries" (47). Theme should also em- brace and make meaning of the "whole" of superficially different world cultures: "Every iota of gain in human thought and sensibility should be ready grist for his [the African American writer's] mill, no matter how far-fetched they may seem in their immediate implica- tions" (45). "Blueprint," therefore, offers a critical theory that defines the role of writers as creators of themselves and their world from their own meaningful materials and experiences. It posits writers who pursue moments of vision, who find new connections among the dissimilar, who search for the meaning of some common human experience of 63</page><page sequence="8">FLOYD OGBURN nature and man, who seek to provide profound insights into the or- dinary, who value "contemplation of the subject matter" as being central to the creative process. "Blueprint" also implies-through botanical metaphors-that the writer's perspective is enriched when connected in some way to nature. The manner in which Wright im- plores writers to view their world and fashion meaning represents "projections in the haiku manner" that precede This Other World by two decades. That features of haiku and Zen are explicit in Wright's earliest lit- erary pieces is certainly not a novel idea. Fabre, for instance, states that Wright "did not have to twist his inspiration into the haiku form; all the necessary elements were already there: word paintings, scenes rapidly sketched, and universal emotions" ("The Poetry of Richard Wright" 270). Similarly, Tener has remarked that the "haiku moment" has always been strongly prevalent in Wright ("The Where, the When, the What: A Study of Richard Wright's Haiku" 280). And in an unpublished letter of July 6, 1960, William Targ (Wright's friend and editor at World Publishing Company) after having examined This Other World reminds Wright of his "poetic gift" and his "virtues as a stylist" to construct "concrete imagery." What is novel, however, is the notion that haiku is far more central to the meaning and style of Wright's early works than has previously been observed, especially in 12 Million Black Voices and Black Boy. Geoffrey Leech and M. H. Short have noted that some writers de- viate from linguistic norms established in their works or employ lan- guage in a manner that is aberrant or uncommon (Leech 68; Short 97). They term this uncommon use of language "foregrounding." Accord- ing to Richard Poirier this tendency to foreground or draw attention to discrete passages in a work through style is especially true of American authors: Thinking of environment in American books as comparative units of space and time, a reader makes an obvious and very poignant discovery. What we remember about a book or a writer-and this is notably true in American literature-is often the smallest, momentary revelations that nonetheless carry...an'enormous sense of inner authority.' (14) Poirer considers these ephemeral revelations "moments of greatest il- lumination"-moments during which writers expend their genius most authentically (14). In short, foregrounded passages contain the essence of a work and direct attention to themselves through stylistic aberration, becoming, as it were, rhetorical centers. Thus, what is piv- otal to meaning and style in 12 Million Black Voices and Black Boy is sit- 64</page><page sequence="9">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU uated in foregrounded passages-in brief but powerful revelations that nevertheless comprise the inner authority of the works. In all in- stances, the foregrounded passages in Wright are those in which haiku elements are pronounced. Told primarily from a Marxist perspective, 12 Million Black Voices recounts through graphic photographs and a poetic prose style the arduous struggles of African Americans in slavery, the post-Recon- struction South, and the urban areas of the North. The picture that Wright paints, for the most part, is one of desolation. Yet, in this bleak world there is one significant moment or source of relief: Our southern springs are filled with quiet noises and scenes of growth. Apple buds laugh into blossom. Honeysuckles creep up the sides of houses. Sunflowers nod in the hot fields. From mossy tree-oak, elm, willow, aspen, sycamore, dogwood, cedar, walnut, ash, and hickory- bright green leaves jut from a million branches to form an awning that tries to shield and shade the earth. Blue and pink kites of small boys sail in the windy air. In summer the magnolia trees fill the countryside with sweet scent for long miles. Days are slumberous, and the skies are high and thronged with clouds that ride fast.... Nights are covered with canopies some- times blue and sometimes black, canopies that sag low with ripe and nervous stars. The throaty boast of frogs momentarily drowns out the call and counter-call of crickets. In autumn the land is afire with color. Red and brown leaves lift and flutter dryly, becoming entangled in the stiff grass and cornstalks.... At twilight the sky is full of wild geese winging ever southward, and bats jerk through the air. At night the winds blow free. In the winter the forests resound with the bite of steel axes eating into tall trees as men gather wood from the leaden days of cold. The guns of hunters snap and crack.... Occasionally the rivers leap their banks and leave new thick layers of silt to enrich the earth, and then the look of the land is garish, bleak, suffused with a first-day stillness, strange- ness, and awe. (162-64) The attention devoted to nature here is stylistically unlike any other moment in the history. A paean to the seasons, these passages assign nature enormous authority and emotional power within the history. While nature does evoke negative images in the history-most of the lynchings occur in autumn at harvest time-these passages elevate nature to the central position it holds in haiku and Zen Buddhism. They exhibit an unabashed love for nature, which, as R. H. Blyth has 65</page><page sequence="10">FLOYD OGBURN noted, is "the unspoken creed of haiku poets" (Haiku 1: 28). In addition to the exaltation of nature, Black Boy goes one step fur- ther. At key moments within the autobiography, Wright dispels logi- cal distinctions and looks intuitively at his experiences through lens- es provided by nature. Only after he is able to free himself morally, spiritually, and intellectually is Wright able to comprehend the "cryp- tic tongue" of nature. Indeed, "the moments of living slowly revealed their coded meanings" to Wright when he looked into nature intu- itively, providing him newly perceived sensations and the meaning hidden in his daily concrete experiences (8). There are two key moments in Black Boy when Wright examines nature without logical and intellectual understanding. In both cases, he realizes discrete moments of vision derived through the senses- through, as Blyth has said of haiku poetry, meaningful touch, taste, sound, sight, and smell. Because the language employed in them is stylistically different from other places in the autobiography, these passages become foregrounded-rhetorical centers of authority. The first moment occurs early in the autobiography, after Wright has been severely punished for having set his grandparents' house afire: Each event spoke with a cryptic tongue. And the moments of living re- vealed their coded meanings. There was the wonder I felt when I first saw a brace of mountain-like, spotted, black-and-white-horses clop- ping down a dusty road through clouds of powdered clay. There was the delight I caught in seeing long straight rows of red and green vegetables stretching away in the sun to the bright horizon. There was the faint, cool kiss of sensuality when dew came onto my cheeks and shins as I ran down the wet green garden paths in early morning. There was the vague sense of the infinite as I looked down upon the yellow, dreaming waters of the Mississippi River from the verdant bluffs of Natchez. There were the echoes of nostalgia I heard in the crying strings of wild geese winging south against a bleak, autumn sky. There was the tantalizing melancholy in the tingling scent of burning hickory wood.... There was the incomprehensible secret embodied in a whitish toad- stool hiding in the dark shade of a rotting log.... 66</page><page sequence="11">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU There was the hot panic that welled up in my throat and swept through my blood when I first saw the lazy, limp coils of a blue- skinned snake sleeping in the sun. There was the love I had for the mute regality of tall, moss-clad oaks.... And there was the quiet terror that suffused my senses when vast hazes of gold washed earthward from star-heavy skies on silent nights.... (8-10) The second moment occurs also after Wright has received a severe beating, this time for blithely instructing his grandmother "to kiss back there": The days and hours began to speak now with a clearer tongue. Each experience had a sharp meaning of its own. There was the breathless anxious fun of chasing and catching flitting fireflies on drowsy summer nights. There was the drenching hospitality in the pervading smell of sweet magnolias. There was the aura of limitless freedom distilled from the rolling sweep of tall green grass swaying and glinting in the wind and sun.... There was the suspense I felt when I heard the taut, sharp song of a yellow-black bee hovering nervously but patiently above a white rose.... There was the puckery taste that almost made me cry when I ate my first half-ripe persimmon.... And there were the long, slow, drowsy days and nights of drizzling rain.... (52-54) Although appearing briefly, these haiku moments exert tremen- dous influence within the autobiography because they are fore- grounded-stylistically different from other passages within the text. These foregrounded passages represent Wright's greatest moments of illumination in Black Boy. Taken together, 12 Million Black Voices and Black Boy demonstrate through stylistic deviation how Wright was profoundly attracted to ideas similar to the basic tenets of Zen and haiku long before he read R. H. Blyth. Wright recounts in Black Boy of devoting "hours and days pound- ing out disconnected sentences for the sheer love of words" in imita- 67</page><page sequence="12">FLOYD OGBURN tion of Gertrude Stein's Three Lives: "' The old man huddled in the dark doorway, his bony face lit by the burning yellow in the win- dows of distant skyscrapers"' (330). In a remark that prefigures Blyth's belief that haiku emphasizes the physical and sensational (Haiku 1: 247-55), Wright adds that his "purpose was to capture a physical state or movement that carried a strong subjective impres- sion." The "single aim of my living," he concludes, was to "drench the reader with a sense of a new world" (330). This Other World repre- sents Wright's most sustained and successful effort at achieving the single aim of his life. To reduce 4,000 haiku to 811 (the number of haiku in the final draft of This Other World) was agonizing to Wright.5 But by April 8, 1960, he had employed rather unorthodox organizing strategies to settle upon 1,500 haiku: "He...glued them all onto huge pieces of cardboard and later onto loose pages hung on iron rods" (Unfinished 508). By mid- April, he was finally able to bring the total down to 811 (82 pages), but he "spent almost another month changing their order within the sequence of seasons" (508). Wright sent the 82-page manuscript to the typist around the last of May 1960 and the final draft to William Targ June 8, 1960 (508). There are three working drafts of This Other World, although it is difficult to tell when Wright generated them. Perhaps he wrote them during mid-April. At any rate, these three drafts provide clear insight into how he struggled to shape perspec- tive and meaning in the final draft-his "new world."6 The first working draft (Typescript, File 162) contains 889 haiku arranged by season: 213 in winter, 358 in spring, 205 in summer, and 113 in autumn. Several pages are missing from the winter section. At the end of this draft are 72 additional haiku arranged without sea- sonal divisions. While Wright seems interested in maintaining the seasonal refer- ence and divisions in this draft, he appears more concerned about re- vising individual poems, making them convey more clearly and con- cisely his intent. For example, he changes "Cool winds are blowing, / Rearranging fallen leaves / In the setting sun" to "A fitful autumn wind, / Rearranging fallen leaves / In the setting sun" (Spring 9). And "The crow flew so fast / That he left a lonely caw / Behind in the streets" becomes "The crow flew so fast / That he left his lonely caw / Behind in the fields" (Spring 9). The second working draft (Typescript, File 161) contains 803 haiku arranged according to season: 252 in spring, 196 in summer, 168 in autumn, and 187 in winter. While this draft does not include all of the poems from the previous working draft, it does maintain all of the re- visions made to individual poems. No other working draft illustrates 68</page><page sequence="13">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU Wright's struggle to impose order upon his poems better than this draft. In a letter to Margrit de Sabloniere, Wright laments the difficul- ty that he is having with the haiku: "The problem of selecting them is agonizing. I'm trying to figure out a scheme" (qtd. in Fabre, "Poetry of Richard Wright" 270). And no other draft documents more clearly Wright's dependence upon the traditions of haiku poetry and Zen Buddhism, as they are explained in R. H. Blyth, to locate and define his "sense of a new world." No editing of individual lines occurs in draft two. Wright seems solely concerned with finding a method to group his haiku that su- persedes the seasonal divisions of traditional Japanese haiku. Thus, he classifies the poems accordingly: "Projection," "Personification," "F," "Q," "Other World," "Relation," "Contrast," "Time," "Agree- ment," "Sensation," "Illusion," "Cryptic," "Absence," "Death," "An- imal Humor," "Timelessness," "Pathos," "Delicate," "Silence," and "Religion." However, some poems remain unclassified. That several of these categories are not mutually exclusive under- scores the difficulty Wright has "trying to figure out a scheme" that assigns meaning and order to the poems. Yet, as his meticulous anno- tations suggest, he persists because these categories define the funda- mental characteristics of his new world, particularly its central mys- teries, sensations, relationships, and secular and religious tenets. For those categories that do overlap, it seems to make more sense to view them as interdependent rather than as independent, individ- ual categories. "Relation," for instance, overlaps more categories than any other single category. That is, Wright felt that some of the haiku in "Relation" could also have been placed in "Agreement," Contrast," "Illusion," "Cryptic," "Absence," or "Time." In effect, these categories appear to function as subcategories of "Relation," each one unveiling a discrete aspect of what Wright intends by "Relation." Several of the subcategories clearly reveal strong influence by Blyth's study. "Agreement," the largest subcategory, seems to draw upon what Blyth perceives to be one of the Zen states of mind "which the creation and appreciation of haiku demand"-grateful accep- tance (Haiku 1: 162). Blyth remarks: "It is a statue [sic] of grateful ac- ceptance of all that is inside us and outside us, our own shortcomings as well as those of others" (1: 180). "Agreement" provides graphic images of the grateful acceptance of varied aspects of life, from phys- ical disability to servants to the repulsive to prostitution.

(Summer 30) Interestingly, the preponderance of poems in "Agreement" (and in "Relation" in general) explore loneliness and invite its acceptance: I am nobody- A red sinking autumn sun Took my name away. (Autumn 35)7 From across the lake, Past the black winter trees, Faint sounds of a flute. (Winter 52) Settling on the screen Of the crowded movie house, A white butterfly. (Summer 29) Blyth contends that loneliness is the second state of mind necessary for the creation and appreciation of haiku. He adds that in all true Zen language and conversation when two minds are truly in communion, "any given word connotes its logical opposite." He suggests, there- fore, that loneliness "is also a state of interpenetration with all other things" (1: 172). The fact that Wright devotes so many haiku in "Agreement" to loneliness would suggest that he is viewing loneli- ness in this light-as a necessary precondition to agreement or inter- penetration with all things. For example, the poet in "I am nobody-" begins by declaring a state of absolute loneliness and selflessness. The poet gives the finite self to nature in order to realize the infinite selful- ness evident in the universe. Like the true Zen disciple, the poet un- derstands that loneliness is a condition of profound spiritual poverty. And in achieving spiritual poverty, the poet possesses all. 70</page><page sequence="15">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU Blyth observes that the loneliness of haiku emanates not from the seclusion of the poet, desolate places, or forgotten men, but from the absence of things that never were, from the pleasant things that hap- pen when one is sad, and from the nameless realm where the human and non-human meet and are one (Haiku 1: 172). Wright seems guid- ed by these notions of loneliness in the "Absence" subcategory: From the dark still pines, Not a breath of autumn wind To ripple the lake. (Autumn 42) The Calliope fades, But the autumn wind still echoes Its tune in the streets. (Autumn 36) This autumn evening Is full of an empty sky And one empty road. (Autumn 42) In "From the dark still pines," the autumn wind disappoints the pine trees, the lake, and the poet on this particular day. This natural force on which all three have come to depend does not appear. While the absence of the wind provides the impetus for and tone of the poem, it does not lessen the poet's sudden awareness of the universal life- the connection among the poet, the pines, the absent wind, and the lake. However, in "The Calliope fades," the feelings of loneliness and absence are replaced by the poet's recognition that nature-the au- tumn wind-has sustained the joys which departed with the circus. And in "This autumn evening," the poet, the evening sky, and the road converge in a nebulous realm to become "empty" and, in doing so, achieve its logical opposite. Two additional subcategories of "Relation" imply Blyth's influ- ence: "Contrast" and "Illusion." Both examine again and again "con- tradictoriness," which Blyth offers as the sixth state of mind neces- sary for the creation and appreciation of haiku: "Zen is often con- veyed by some intellectual contradiction, explicit or implicit, expressed in the form of paradox or dilemma, that is somehow re- solved by a living experience" (1: 206). Thus, paradox is central in "Contrast": A spring mountain holds The foundations of a house Long since tumbled down. (Spring 2) Coming from the woods, 71</page><page sequence="16">FLOYD OGBURN The bull has a lilac sprig Dangling from a horn. (Spring 13)8 Paradox is also primary in "Illusion": For seven seconds The steam from the train whistle Blew out the spring moon. (Spring 17) Summer mountains move To let the sinking sun pass To the other side. (Summer 19) In "For seven seconds," the poet divines truth and unity in the seem- ingly absurd. On one level, the poem simply recounts an illusion: the steam from the train whistle momentarily obstructs the poet's view of the spring moon, implying that the artificial has the power to eclipse the natural. In fact, the artificial seems in opposition to the natural. On a deeper level-revealed primarily through alliteration- the poem celebrates the unity between the artificial and natural: "sev- en," "seconds," "steam," "spring." The artificial-"seven," "sec- onds," and "steam"-succumbs to and culminates in "spring." Thus, in the illusory and ephemeral artificial eclipse, the poet discerns and joins with the more powerful and enduring lunar or solar eclipse of nature. Like "Contrast" and "Illusion," the "Cryptic" subcategory ex- plores and seeks to resolve the paradoxical. With this subcategory, Wright returns to the "cryptic tongue" and "coded meanings" in Black Boy: "There were the echoes of nostalgia I heard in the crying strings of wild geese winging south against a bleak autumn sky.... There was the love I had for the mute regality of tall, moss-clad oaks" (8-9). These passages foreshadow two haiku in "Cryptic": Calling and calling, Long strings of wild geese Passing a graveyard. (Autumn 43) On a clapboard house, An old oak tree's shadow fades In the autumn sun. (Autumn 42) "Calling and calling" and "On a clapboard house" demonstrate the extent to which the study of Zen and haiku had influenced Wright's view of the craft of writing nature poetry. In Black Boy Wright per- ceives nature through stock descriptions and logical reasoning. 72</page><page sequence="17">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU Drawing upon personification-one of the manifestations of logical reasoning-he tells the reader what the nature passages mean: The "crying strings of wild geese" and the "bleak autumn sky" create "echoes of nostalgia." And "oaks have a "mute regality." In "Calling and calling" and "On a clapboard house" however, Wright abandons intellectual conceits, stock descriptions, and intrusive commentary. Instead, he presents concrete things or objects-"wild geese," "grave- yard," "clapboard house," "old oak tree"-without describing them or explaining what they mean. These objects and things carry the emotional power of the scenes. As the haiku poet should, Wright uses the objects to present experiences simply and succinctly, leaving the reader to intuit or imagine the details necessary to make meaning. "Time," the final subcategory of "Relation," examines time calmly and dispassionately. Time is accepted as a fact of life: Each ebbing sea wave Makes pebbles glare at the moon, Then fall back to sleep. (Spring 4) Gone are the fear and dread of time that controlled the lives of Jake Johnson, Big Boy, Dave Sanders, Bigger Thomas, Johnny Gibbs, Cross Damon, or Fishbelly. Thus, "Relation" strongly endorses the Zen notion of grateful ac- ceptance. Consonance, dissonance, illusion, mystery, loneliness, self- lessness, and the inevitability of time are acknowledged and em- braced. Indeed, they provide for the poet moments of vision, oppor- tunities to discover, even in the paradoxical, profound new truths about himself and his connection to mankind and to nature. Few categories, however, articulate the newness and excitement of Wright's "other world" better than "Projection" and the categories with which it is thematically connected. The tone of this category is strongly optimistic and emanates from a world that is playful and peaceful: Little boys tossing Stones at a guilty scarecrow In a snowy field. (Winter 51 ) The night must be long, The cold sea cow sleeps deeply On a bed of stars. (Winter 54) In addition, most of the images are related to fertility and creativity: 73</page><page sequence="18">FLOYD OGBURN Holding too much rain, The tulip stoops and spills it, Then straightens again. (Spring 12) A silent spring wood: A crow opens its sharp beak And creates a sky. (Spring 16) Finally, there is in "Projection" a strong sense of freedom, especially the freedom to believe in the impossible: A fleeing white fence Is ripping the moon away From the April clouds. (Spring 11) "Freedom from what men ordinarily consider possible and impos- sible" is what Blyth believes is the eighth state of mind which the cre- ation and appreciation of haiku demand (Haiku 1: 225). Initiated in "Projection," this conception of freedom (Blyth offers several) is the one most prevalent and most explored in several related categories: "F," "Q," "Personification," and "Other World."9 The haiku in "F" reveal a world of fantasy and fairy tale: Would not green peppers Make strangely lovely insects If they sprouted legs? (Spring 1) Creamy plum blossoms, Once upon a time there was A pretty princess... (Spring 16) The haiku in "F" also ponder a world that goes unnoticed by ordi- nary people: Only the horses Really know the exact hour When the snow fell last night. (Winter 51) Apparently, the unperceived or unnoticed world is part of what Wright means by "Other World," as the only two poems in this cate- gory indicate: The plow-split anthill Reveals scurrying black cities Under the horse's tail. (Spring 1) 74</page><page sequence="19">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU From under the house My cat comes with dusty fur And cobwebbed whiskers. (Spring 2) The haiku in "Personification" sustain the theme of the fantastic pri- marily by assigning human characteristics to a number of inanimate things:?1 A flood of spring rain Searching into drying grasses Finds a lost doll. (Spring 4) Finally, the haiku in "Q" are all questions about the mysterious or puzzling: O dark green melons, Who shines your slick skins so smooth, Making them mirrors? (Summer 21) Taken together then, the haiku in "Projection" and related categories present a prediction or plan for a new world. The plan requires opti- mism, joy, and a sense of peace. It is also built upon a willingness or freedom to explore and believe in the unseen and impossible. The theme of freedom also gives unity to the "Timelessness" cate- gory, this time "freedom from the bounds of time and place" (Blyth, Haiku 1: 227): And also tonight, The same evening star above The same apple tree. (Summer 22) In "Delicate," Wright shows the influence of the haiku master Issa by paying homage to the minute and powerless: A snail hesitates, Contracting one of its horns In a gust of wind. (Spring 1) In the remaining haiku in this category, Wright acknowledges a dew- drop, a tiny whirlwind, a falling petal, beads of quicksilver, a feather, a grasshopper, a bee, a caterpillar, a butterfly, etc. The "Delicate" category, as with other categories, is successful be- cause Wright is able to elicit the senses of taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound effectively. Thus, it should not be surprising that he de- votes a whole category to "Sensation,"11 which Blyth sees as directly connected to "meaning" in haiku (History of Haiku 1: 8). In "Sensa- 75</page><page sequence="20">FLOYD OGBURN tion," as in "Delicate" and "Silence," Wright seems bent upon coerc- ing the reader to examine this new world closely and carefully, to ex- perience it through the senses: The sound of a snake Slithering over dry leaves Is as hot as fire. (Summer 25) Perhaps the most ambiguous category is "Religion." Clearly, Wright is not using religion in the conventional sense of the word. As Eugene Miller says, "The essence of these poems that makes them ap- pear to him [Wright] as 'religion,' whatever it means to him, is not se- mantic but rather a 'mood' that can take on religious configuration. Looked at from such a perspective, the poems become a nondiscur- sive expression of the name Wright gave to an apparently recurring form of feeling that he distinguishes as 'religion,' like and yet unlike the traditional understanding of that word" (249). The overriding "mood" in this category seems related to the Zen belief that religion is the grateful acceptance of "life in perfect accord with reality" (Blyth, Haiku 1: 199). The haiku in this category evoke a variety of im- ages, but all construct life in perfect harmony with reality: As a big cloud melts, Smaller and cooler clouds appear Deep in the spring sky. (Spring 13) Whatever Wright intends by the word religion, one thing is clear; his religion, like Zen, is non-moral: "Zen is concerned neither with sin nor with virtuous action. Loving, responsive, free acceptance makes the poet good without being either moral or immoral" (Giroux 67). Of the three remaining categories-"Pathos," "Animal Humor," and "Death"-"Death" perhaps is the most interesting and most clearly connected to Wright's vision of his new world, ironically by its absence. Indeed, death plays a minor role in this new world. In fact, there are few poems throughout this draft that explore death. Also minor is "Animal Humor," which seems based upon Zen scato- logical humor or Zen humor that drops from the sublime to the ridiculous (Blyth, Haiku 1: 221-22): A tolling church bell: A rat rears in the moon light And stares at the steeple. (Spring 3) The poems in "Pathos," like those in "Absence," are concerned prin- cipally with loneliness: 76</page><page sequence="21">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU A slow autumn rain: The sad eyes of my mother Fill a lonely night. (Autumn 40) Of the four drafts of This Other World, draft 2 (File 161) provides the greatest insight into Wright's composing process and intent, and offers the clearest evidence of his unique use of haiku. Wright works out moods, attitudes, and concepts that will inform his new world. At the same time that he borrows from the traditions of Japanese haiku and Zen to construct his world, he adapts those traditions to his own perspective and purpose. To be sure, Wright intends This Other World to be organized by specific concepts, not by the seasonal divisions of traditional Japanese haiku. Draft 4-Typescript, File 163-is the draft that Wright submitted to William Targ for publication. This draft does not have a table of con- tents, although the one for working draft 3 fits it fairly well.12 In addi- tion, draft 4 does not divide the poems into four separate seasons, as is characteristic of traditional Japanese haiku. More importantly, the haiku are subtly arranged in clusters around the key concepts, moods, and attitudes worked out in draft 2. For the most part, the clusters proceed accordingly: "Contrast," "Delicate," "Cryptic," "Re- lation," "Illusion," "Projection," "Sensation," "Agreement," "Reli- gion," "F," "Q," "Pathos," "Timelessness,"13 "Personification," "Time," "Absence," "Animal Humor," "Other World," and "Death."14 As has been demonstrated previously, these are the con- cepts that give meaning and form to This Other World. This Other World is not an anomaly or detour taken by Wright near the end of his career. Nor does it represent a new direction. If any- thing, This Other World is an old direction rediscovered and revisited. It is an attempt to reclaim early personal theories of creativity, which require the writer "to fuse and make articulate the experiences of men," to "create the myths and symbols that inspire a faith in life, to "wonder out of what materials can a human world be built" ("Blue- print" 43, 49). It is also an attempt to redevelop the brief, yet stylisti- cally powerful, visions and to renew the love of nature evident in Black Boy and 12 Million Black Voices. In some ways, the works con- ventionally studied by Wright scholars-Uncle Tom's Children, Eight Men, Lawd Today, Native Son, The Outsider, and The Long Dream-rep- resent unsuccessful attempts at building a new world. They fail be- cause they are profoundly anti-Zen: they sacrifice intuition to the in- tellectual, philosophical, and moral; they do not perceive unity and achieve enlightenment among the paradoxical and disparate. In some of these works, the perspectives they foster suggest a Wright 77</page><page sequence="22">FLOYD OGBURN who at times stands "too close" to his works, resulting in "blurred vi- sion." In others, the perspectives imply a Wright who stands "too far away," resulting in " neglect of important things" (Blueprint" 45). In This Other World, Wright finally demonstrates that meaning pro- ceeds equally as much from contemplation of subject matter as from the things that rage in the heart of the writer ("Blueprint" 47). He is also able to locate "that fixed point in intellectual space" for which he has been searching. In doing so, he achieves, perhaps for the first time in his life, moral, spiritual, and intellectual emancipation. Notes 1.

For a review of past scholarship, see Fabre, "The Poetry of Richard Wright" 252-72; Tener 273-98; Kodama, "Japanese Influence on Richard Wright in His Last Years" 63-73; and Miller 245-53. Only Kodama and Miller examine the un- published haiku. Tener provides the following publication history in a foot- note: Eight first appeared in Ollie Harrington, "The Last Days of Richard Wright," Ebony, No. 16 (Feb. 1961), pp. 93-94; four more appeared in Constance Webb, Richard Wright (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1968), pp. 393-94; four- teen were published in Richard Wright, "Fourteen Haikus," Studies in Black Lit- erature, 1 (Autumn 1970) 1, of these three being from Webb; ten were published in the Wright Issue of New Letters, 38 (Winter 1971), 100-01, of these two being from Webb and nine from Studies in Black Literature; four, three from Ebony, one from Webb, in Michel Fabre, The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright, trans. Is- abel Barzun (New York: William Morrow &amp; Co., 1973), pp. 506, 513; and final- ly, all twenty-three in the Richard Wright Reader, ed. Ellen Wright and Michel Fabre (New York: Harper and Row, 1978), pp. 251-54. 3. The discussion of haiku and Zen Buddhism in this section belies their rich his- tory and complexity. For additional reading, see: R.H. Blyth, Haiku, 4 vols. (Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1949-52) and History of Haiku, 2 vols.

Tuttle, 1974), Nancy Wilson Ross, ed., The World of Zen (New York: Random House, 1960), and Kenneth Yasuda, The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English (1957; Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle, 1965). 4. Fabre says in The Unfinished Quest that Wright had been attempting haiku since August 1959 (505). However, I think Wright may have begun experi- menting with haiku as early as February 1959. On the back of a letter from William Targ dated 23 Feb. 1959, Wright wrote the following haiku: "Every de- tail flares / On still, clear, sunset light, / Then dies in darkness." Quoted by permission of Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. 5. Regarding his progress on the haiku, Wright wrote to Margrit de Sabloniere May 29, 1960: "I'm now through with the haikus.... There are 811 in all and they will make a ms. of some 80 pages" (Fabre, "The Poetry of Richard Wright" 270). Actually, the final draft contains 817 haiku. 6. There are four drafts of This Other World at Beinecke, numbered sequentially from 161-64. However, Beinecke's numbering system is somewhat confusing. I 78</page><page sequence="23">RICHARD WRIGHT'S UNPUBLISHED HAIKU believe that Typescript, File 162 is the first draft. It divides the haiku by season and contains numerous annotations in Wright's handwriting. Typescript, File 161 is the second draft; it incorporates the handwritten annotations of File 162. In addition, File 161 classifies the haiku by season and by special concepts in- vented by Wright. The third draft is Typescript, File 164. It includes all the changes in text made previously and several haiku not contained in any of the previous working drafts. Also, File 164 meticulously classifies the poems by season. It begins with a table of contents, one page for each season. On each page of the table of contents, Wright gives in Arabic numerals the page num- ber of the haiku followed by the number of poems to be found on the page in Roman numerals: 4 - X. In several instances however, pages within the text do not contain the number of poems indicated in the table of contents. The fourth and final draft is Typescript, File 163. It is the draft that Wright sent to William Targ at World Publishing. Neither does it contain a table of contents (though the one for File 164 fits it fairly well), nor does it divide the haiku into discrete seasonal sections. All quotations from these typescripts appear by permission of Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. 7. This poem has been published in the Richard Wright Reader by Ellen Wright and Michel Fabre. Curiously, however they not only omit the punctuation marks in this haiku, they also omit them in most of the other haiku. 8. This poem has been published in the Richard Wright Reader. 9. Although I have discussed "Illusion" and "Cryptic" as subcategories of "Rela- tion," both also illustrate freedom from what most consider possible and im- possible. 10. In Haiku, vol. 1, Blyth makes clear that personification is carefully avoided in Japanese haiku. Thus, Wright's use of personification in so many haiku is clearly intentional and provides additional evidence that he is not seeking to imitate traditional Japanese haiku in This Other World. 11. Wright also uses "S" as a category heading, which I take to be an abbreviation for "Sensation." 12. Given the emphasis placed upon organizing by concepts in draft 2, the atten- tion granted to seasonal divisions in draft 3-Typescript, File 164-comes as a surprise. Yet a close examination of the table of contents reveals that Wright is using seasonal divisions in a manner that even differs from traditional Japan- ese haiku. Wright intermixes his seasons rather than keep them separate. The table of contents page for "Winter" provides a good example: WINTER I II 4- X 19- VII 49- X 77- IV 76- III 16- III 66- X 39-I 53- VII 42- VI 53- VI 33- VI 50- VI 16- II 55- X 68- X 53- LX 58- X 79</page><page sequence="24">FLOYD OGBURN Like the remaining pages in the table of contents, "Winter" gives page num- bers in Arabic numerals and the number of haiku per page in Roman numer- als. For example, on page 4 of this draft should be found 10 haiku connected to winter. Although the page numbers are accurate, draft 3 rarely contains the number of haiku per page specified in the table of contents. In fact, there are only 284 haiku in this draft. 13. Constance Webb in her biography on Wright implies that Wright's daughter Julia wrote the following haiku at his death: "Burning out its time, / And tim- ing its own burning, / One lonely candle." This haiku however was written by Wright and appears in the "Timelessness" cluster. 14. "Death," like several categories, recurs briefly throughout this draft. In fact, the table of contents for draft 3 indicates that Wright at one point had consid- ered placing all of the haiku that deal with death in an epilogue. Works Cited Blyth, R. H. Haiku. Vol. 1.
