He has published extensively on human ecological design, design theory, environmental aesthetics, and Oriental architecture and gardens. A graduate of Seoul University in Korea, he earned his MLA and a Ph.D. in Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. Abstract: An ecological theory of design, built on current theories of conscious and unconscious creativity, provides an inclusive , descriptive foundation for a new theory of aesthetics, one that is useful for explaining both artistic beauty and natural beauty, a theory relevant to both architecture and landscape architecture. In the construction of this ecological aesthetic, central concepts that link design principles and aesthetic theory are identified and differentiated. This paper expands tradi- tional principles of formal aesthetics - unity and balance - and proposes a third principle, complementarity. It presents these three principles - inclusive unity, dynamic balance, and compie - mentarity - as an ecological paradigm of aesthetics and demonstrates their power to explain aesthetic experience and aesthetic quality of designs and other creative products. An judgment appreciation of aesthetic for and value the judgment of aesthetic value are integral parts of creative life. Environmental designers are dis- tinguished by their professional con- cern for and their role in enhancing aesthetic quality of the built environ- ment. For this reason, architecture, in its broad sense, is frequently classified as art and often distinguished from the act of building. Though designers deal with aesthetic matters professionally, ordinary people are also influenced in their choices by aesthetic considera- tions. Yet today, although many designers talk about aesthetic values and make aesthetic judgments, few can articulate the nature of aesthetics and beauty objectively. The term aesthetic has become too vague to be useful. Design students and professionals, when asked about seemingly whimsical designs, often answer, "it is just aes- thetics," while non-designers and lay persons (perhaps aestheticians as well) in similar circumstances would respond, "it is just design." Aesthetics and design, in this case, mean some- thing that has very little to do with functional and economic concerns. Discussion thus reaches a deadlock, The manuscript for this article was accepted for the Spring 1987 issue of Landscape Journal. Publication was delayed so it could be included with this special theme issue. and so will the advancement of design disciplines should this state continue. This paper proposes an ecologi- cal aesthetic and advances the following three theses: (1) there is an undesirable gap between aesthetic theory and environmental design; (2) an inclusive and dynamic theory of aesthetics is necessary for the design of an inclusive and adaptable environment; and (3) such a theory can be developed on the basis of a dynamic theory of cre- ativity, as opposed to the static concept of beauty. The Gap between Aesthetics and Environmental Design The attention of the aesthetician has shifted in the last twenty years from a traditional positivistic look at art objects (or the "appearance" of form) and from the reflective discussion of the idea of beauty to the current concern for subjective or experiential interac- tions with environment (Berleant 1970, Dewey 1934). The disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, and interior design have now, for about two decades, been known collectively as "environmental design," reflecting a shift of focus from "form" to "environ- ment." A parallel is the emerging "en- vironmental aesthetic, " which indicates a shift from the aesthetics of form to the aesthetics of environment. 1 Today, many "basic design" books and much environmental design literature still desìi with such principles as unity and balance as primary "form- ing" principles. Phenomenological aestheticians correctly regard such an approach as object- centered, appear- ance-oriented aesthetics and claim that the very nature of aesthetic quality lies not in the object itself but in the totality of human experience of the object. Once attention is shifted from object to experience, all kinds of environments that provoke aesthetic experience can be included in the discussion, and vari- ations in the responses of individuals can then be recognized. Yet, many designers continue to employ formal, object-centered principles because they find them useful. (Table I summarizes the differences between formal and phenomenological aesthetics, and the ecological aesthetics proposed here). The core of the questions raised by the current gap between aesthetics and design are twofold. First, how can environmental designs and design the- ories become holistic when their domi- nant theoretical and aesthetic founda- tions still remain reductionistic and positivistic? Second, if reigning aes- thetic theories do not offer a basis for prescriptive principles of inclusive, dynamic design, to whom can environ- mental designers turn for sound aes- thetic principles to guide their design process?2 The first question must be addressed by the environmental design disciplines. The second question, how- ever, requires collaboration between designers and aestheticians at both the- oretical and empirical levels, because Koh 177</page><page sequence="2">TABLE I Comparison of Formal, Phenomenological and Ecological Aesthetics Formal Phenomenological Ecological Criterion aesthetics aesthetics aesthetics Philosophical Base Dualistic, scientific, Holistic, phenomenological, Holistic, ecological, positivistic, objective humanistic, subjective evolutionary, both subjective and objective Focus Aesthetics of appearance Aesthetics of experience Aesthetics of creativity in nature and art Raw Data Aesthetic concepts Aesthetic facts Creative facts Method of Inquiry Relies on reflection Examines aesthetic Empirical research on natural experience of artistic beauty and artistic creativity Nature of View Exclusive, normative, static Inclusive, descriptive, Inclusive, descriptive, dynamic evolutionary Relationship to Design Relevant to ordering Not necessarily relevant to Relevant to ordering principles ordering principles principles Relationship between Artwork to be observed from Artwork to be experienced Artwork to be appreciated Perceivers and the art work a distance through participation and produced through participation and adaptation Museum art syndrome Living or action art Art for people and place Increased distance between Decreased distance in Decreased distance in art and public "aesthetic field" human-environment system Artist's Approach to Art Work Designer/artist tends to Designer/artist tends to Designer/artist tends to produce object- centered art produce experience-centered produce experience/ (i.e., creation of form and art (i.e., creation of environment-centered art object) experience) (i.e., creation of evolving environment) Relation to Mass Media Easy to attract media Less easy to attract media Less easy to attract media attention (e.g., photographs) attention due to process attention due to process and due to object orientation orientation system orientation Image of Artist Artist/designer as hero, Perceiver/performer as co- Perceiver/performer as genius, and aloof master participants in the creation participants in the creative and appreciation of process of design and "Master/Mastery Syndrome" experiences appreciation Breadth of Focus Emphasis on visual/audio Emphasis on active Emphasis on total conscious/ sensations perception and experience unconscious experience and creativity the gap between current aesthetic theo- ries and the practice and theories of design is probably a result of the insularity of both disciplines. Such a failure of interdisciplinary communica- tion may also be, at least partly, attrib- utable to the difference between the verbal and theoretical tradition of phi- losophy and the visual and pragmatic tradition of design disciplines, and per- haps partly to the focus of these dis- ciplines on internal disagreements instead of on the broader social rele- vance.3 Bridging the Gap A theoretical synthesis between aesthetics and design disciplines yields substantial benefits: 1 . Aesthetic theories can be applied and tested for their usefulness in design. 2. Aesthetic issues central to arch- itecture and other environmental design disciplines can be evaluated empirically and their debate made more productive, thus helping to advance the rationaliza- tion of the designers' decisions based on aesthetic grounds. 3 . The disciplines of aesthetics, art, and architecture can become more inclusive (i.e., transcending the duality of high art vs. craft) and more interac- tive in collective inquiry through common languages and foci. 4. Experience-based aesthetics can help discourage the object- cen- tered, star- worshipping tradition of architecture. 5. The discipline of aesthetics can become more relevant to social issues concerning aesthetic-related matters in ordinary life. Because aesthetics is not 1 78 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="3">presently useful as a prescriptive basis for design, its contribution is limited and its validity suspect.4 Theoretical synthesis requires one to find either a unifying concept (a common ground for both disciplines)5 or general theories of the respective dis- ciplines that are unifiable. In this regard, the theories of creativity offer us not only a useful but also a scientific basis. Creativity6 is a concept that links aesthetics with design, art with science, product with process, perception with cognition and experience, and aesthet- ics of art works with aesthetics of natu- ral beauty. The link is clearly evi- denced in the following observations derived from current thought in biol- ogy, psychology, neurophysiology, and artificial intelligence. 1 . Design and aesthetic experi- ence aire creative processes of ordering in cognitive as well as perceptual realms. 2. Perception and cognition are indivisible from each other and com- plementary. Both are creative adaptive processes: creative in that perceptual and conceptual structuring occurs and adaptive in that our mentad schema must be accommodated to a new type of information that does not assimilate into the schema (Rock 1983, Piaget 1971). 3. Design and the creative prob- lem* solving process (artistic as well as scientific creativity) involve visual thinking and aesthetic judgment. Both creative designer and scientist seek not just an original solution but an elegant solution (Taylor and Getzel 1975, Tor- rance 1975). 4. Playfulness, humor, and hedonism, frequently associated with a sense of beauty, are also closely related to the four major aspects of psychologi- cal research on creativity: the creative process, product, person, and environ- ment (Taylor and Getzel 1975). 5. Creative products, both in nature and in human works of art, tend to provoke an aesthetic response. 6. Creative scientists, artists, and architects tend to place higher value on "aesthetic" and "theoretical" matters than on "pragmatic" and "eth- ical" matters (MacKinnon 1978) 7. The principles guiding cre- ative processes tend to be manifested in creative products, because product and process are two different but interre- lated aspects of one and the same thing/ event. Focusing on creativity thus pro- vides a firm empirical/ scientific foundation upon which to develop rational arguments for otherwise sub- jective discourse. Thus, aesthetic discussions can bypass elitist or nor- mative criteria of beauty that have plagued many aesthetic discussions to date and have tended to limit aesthetic theory to particular modes of aesthetic experiences or artistic disciplines such as visual arts and music. More specifi- cally, using creativity as a unifying concept, one can, for example, relate Berleanťs (1970) concept of "aesthetic field" as a "general" theory of phe- nomenological aesthetics to a "general" theory of environmental design which can be referred to as "ecological design, " in order to formulate an aes- thetic that can be useful for design (Koh 1978, 1982, 1983a). Toward a General Theory of Creativity During the last quarter century, psychologists have accumulated an extensive literature on creativity. Begin- ning with the pioneering work of Koestler, authors like E. de Bono (1970), W. J. Gordon (1961), J. P. Guilford (1977), D. MacKinnon (1978), A. F. Osborne (1983), S. J. Parnés et ad. (1977), J. L. Singer and E. Switzer (1980), and E. P. Torrance (1975) have all contributed substantiadly to the liter- ature and to our present understanding of creativity through their extensive empiricad research. The ideas in this lit- erature have contributed greatly in four areas: defining creativity, differentiating the understanding of the nature of four aspects of creativity (creative process, creative person, creative product, and creative environment), relating creativ- ity to intelligence, and developing techniques for nurturing creative be- havior and experiences. These scientists and authors adso collectively reveal that creativity is not just divine, not the monopoly of genius or artist, but can be nurtured among almost every headthy person, and that living itself is essen- tially a creative process. Yet these works have been limited generally to human creativity in its mentad and, to a lesser degree, spiritual aspects, excluding the creative pro- cesses in naturad processes or cultural evolutionary processes. For the purpose of our discussion, one needs a generad theory or definition of creativity to be used as a basis for relating it to a gen- eral theory of aesthetics. As long as we seek an aesthetic theory that can ex- plain both artistic and natural beauty, and high art and popular arts, its con- cept of creativity adso must be inclusive of both human and natural, artistic and cultural, creativity. Such a general theory of creativity must account for inclusively diverse kinds of creative processes: an individuals creative imagination at a particular time as well as cognitive and perceptuad develop- ment over time, mental development as well as biological and physiologicad development, the ontogeny as well as the phylogeny; organic as well as inor- ganic evolution, ecosystem develop- ment as well as landscape evolution, and individuad creativity as well as sys- tem creativity. In this regard, Jean Piaget's (1971) theory of cognitive development in children, Carl Jung's (1964) idea of individuation archetype and collective unconscious, Ernst Mayr's (1976) tele- onomic theory of biologicad evolution, Illya Prigogine 's (1976) concept of "order through fluctuation" (explain- ing inorganic evolution), Eugene Odum's (197 1) theory of ecosystem development process, and Luna Leopold's (1964) hydrological inter- pretation of laindscape evolution, and even the emerging theories of cosmic evolution provide collectively useful bases for formulating a generad theory of creativity. As these ideas have been discussed elsewhere (Koh 1978, 1983a, 1983b), a detailed discussion of them is not included here. Based upon these theories, one can perhaps form very generad, broad definitions of the cre- ative process as "raising the level of order" or as "the process leading to higher levels of diversity, complexity, consciousness, stability, or resilience," or as "the process of development lead- ing to a higher level of structural/ functional integration and formal dif- ferentiation, conceptual articulation, and aesthetic awareness" (Blatt 1984, Burton 1974, Koestler 1964). The creative process, it is now known, includes chance happenings Koh 179</page><page sequence="4">and accident. Its process seems to be open ended: not only is it open to envi- ronment, it also does not have an apriori defined goal. Likewise, the cre- ative problem-solving process does not begin with a priori defined problems in a linear mode, but the solution itself defines the problems. The openness thus seems to be one of the most impor- tant attributes of creativity: openness to environment, to feeling, to chance inspiration. This is open-mindedness without premature judgment and prejudice. In the following sections, three general principles of creativity are dis- cussed on the basis of the author's general understanding of this literature on creativity and without citing specific sources. Ecological Theory of Design and Creativity as a Basis of Ecological Aesthetics An ecological theory of environ- mental design must be based on order- ing principles in nature and on human perception and cognition. Such a theory would view architecture broadly as a means for adaptation in a physical and perceptual environment and would be useful in explaining the aesthetic quality of diverse architecture, from East to West, and from high to the vernacular. It also would provide a useful basis for formulating prescriptive principles for the design environments that are responsive to the human ecological con- text and evolutionary purpose. The theory formulated has three principles: inclusive unity, dynamic balance, and complementarity. The advantage of using these principles for a new aesthetic theory is twofold. First, they are linked to tradi- tional aesthetics and design principles of unity, balance and contrast. Second, they relate to contemporary scientific theories of the forming principles of nature. Ecological theory also stands on an inclusive and evolutionary concep- tion of architecture as an "environ- ment," mediating microcosm and mac- rocosm in energy- and information- sys- tem processes. The attention of ecologi- cal designers is not as much on the form and structure of objects or environments per se as on their interrelation, the design of human-environment systems. These three principles can also be used as descriptive principles of the aes- Figure 1 . Piazza San Marco, Venice.

The following sections will there- fore demonstrate how the three princi- ples can be employed to account for not only the nature of the creative process in general and the nature of aesthetic expe- rience in particular, but also the aesthetic quality apparent in design works of special significance. (Support- ing work can be found in Koh 1978, 1983a, 1984a, 1984b). Inclusive Unity Inclusive Unity as a Principle of the Creative Process Unity in classical formal aesthetics refers to a state or an appearance of har- mony, wholeness, and integrity, in which no part can be added or taken away without destroying the whole. Considered virtually the essence of beauty by such Renaissance architects as Alberti and Palladio, unity refers to the exclusive integrity of internal order- ing, having little to do with changing context or diversity of purpose. It was a reflection of the belief in the presence of absolute, universal beauty. That static, "subjective" world view led to and was reinforced by a mode of representation called "perspective" and has been well discussed by Blatt (1984). It was static in that perspective is constructed on fixed points, subjective in that the world was depicted only as seen from a particular human point. Such a view leads to, and is reflected in, the notion of ideal form; divine creativity; the utopia; the deter- ministic, linear, normative approach to design; and even to a heroic image of the designer as genius or inventor, yet many environmental designers still use the perspectives that Cubists broke more than a half-century ago. Inclusive unity, on the other hand, refers to the integrity of form, form as a system interacting with purpose and context, in addition to the internal unity of the form itself. This state of inclusive unity, or "unity with," is a necessary condition of creative processes in nature and in the human mind. The First Law of Thermodynamics (also called the Law of Conservation) dictates that a system be in unity with its environment in the forming process. The unity of human consciousness with the uncon- Koh 181</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5. Le Corbusier's Switzerland Pavillion, Paris University. The windows, by virtue of being responsive to the user's needs, realize variety and expressiveness. Building and people become one system. Such variety is more meaningful and dynamic than the variety in the texture and lines of the building's end walls: it is meaningful because activity is expressed, and dynamic because the variety changes.

The source of variation and creative adaptation in biological systems is the organism's contact with, and need to accommodate to, the changes and diversity of the habitat. The organism and biological system is an open system, open in that it exchanges energy, infor- mation, and matter with its environ- ment. A self-organizing, creative, evolv- ing system is considered to be open to the environment, from which it absorbs as negentropy and to which it discharges entropy (Bertalanffy 1968, Odum 1971, Jantsch 1975). In terms of human creativity, many psychological researchers reveal that highly creative persons are open- minded and are more sensitive to and aware of the processes within and with- out themselves than are less creative persons (Maslow 1954, Rogers 1962, Taylor and Getzel 1975, Torrance 1975). That such open-mindedness is essential to aesthetic experience reveals the interrelationship between the cre- ative process and the aesthetic experience: highly creative persons tend to show higher emphasis on aesthetic concerns, and aesthetic experience itself tends to be creative. Creative persons and organisms also demonstrate this higher adaptability (i.e., resiliency with stability) to a changing environment. Unity with self, being one with one's inner self, seems to enhance creativity by allowing spontaneity, free imagina- tion, self-accepting, sensual, and existential experiences. All creative systems, biological and psychological, are self-organized and self-organizing (i.e., developmental and evolutionary). Lack of internal self- organization can be expressed in terms of lower levels of both health and sta- bility of the biological system. In the case of human beings, it is said that cre- ative persons are secure and healthy and that secure, healthy persons tend to be more creative and willing to take chances than are insecure persons (Maslow 1954, Rogers 1962). Internal integrity of cognitive and affective sys- tems can be expressed as unity of self as well as intergrity among cognitive, affective, and aesthetic values. This inclusive concept of unity leads to a relative and evolutionary view of beauty: beauty as relative to context and purpose and to people and place, and beauty as a reflection of fitness to purpose and context; aesthetic awareness evolves through forming and development. Also, such a view calls for an interactive, experiential approach to design, an anti-heroic, self- actualizing, ego-transcending image of designers, as well as a non- anthropomorphic empa- thy, and a coevolutionary symbiosis with nature. Ecological aesthetics in this regard goes beyond the subjective legacy (or emphasis on personal experi- ence) of phenomenological aesthetics: it recognizes a human's instinctive, un- conscious desire to be in unity with, and establish an umbilical cord with, environment and nature. It explains aesthetic quality in relation not only to 1 82 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="7">the people but to the place, not only to the subject but to the object. Systems that are open to and inte- grated with the larger environment tend to be creative; that is, they are more likely to encounter and respond to changes and stimuli in the environment. Likewise, secure persons who are exposed to rich and stimulating cultural and sensory environments tend to become more creative (Burton 1974). Conversely, it requires an internally secure personality to take challenges and risks. Our built environment, if one of its roles as a mediating environment is to foster further creativity by offering security and challenge, must be enhanced by such inclusive unity. Inclusive Unity as an Aesthetic Principle Just as the ecological theory of environmental design examines the built environment in terms of two-way interactions with its users and context, so the "general" theory of phenomen- ological aesthetics as proposed by Berleant (1970) recognizes the interac- tive relationship between the perceiver and the work of art, suggesting what one might call "participatory aesthetics." Likewise, many psychologists today regard perception and cognition not as a deterministic one-way process of stim- ulus-response, but as an active and interactive creative process balancing what Piaget (1971) called "assimilation" and "accommodation." Furthermore, perception is even likened to the prob- lem-solving process (Rock 1983). Possession of a cognitive scheme is known to facilitate pattern recognition, and yet this scheme must be adjusted to accommodate new patterns to ensure cognitive development and learning. Also, both Berleant 's (1970) idea of "aesthetic field" and Barker's (1968) idea of "behavioral setting" seem to reflect an ecological approach toward the study of perception and behavior in connection with their context as did Gibson (1979). How can the principle of inclusive unity explain aesthetic experience and aesthetic quality? Gan such a general, prescriptive ecological design principle as "unity with people and place" be employed effectively as an inclusive, descriptive aesthetic principle? The answer is yes. This principle implies not only that "aesthetic experience" is evoked when an environment is in "unity with people," but that the aesthetic quality is also produced when an environment is in unity with its context. The aesthetic quality derived from unity with place is the quality that people-centered, experi- ence-based phenomenological aesthetics alone does not explain. The inclusive "unity with people" of an environment means being integrated with, responsive to, and expressive of, the users in their psychological, perceptual, and cognitive aspects: it invites aesthetic participation. Rather than being an object to be observed visually from a distance, inclusive unity as an aesthetic principle means the environment is an interactive state involving all of the human senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. A built environment must be open to peo- ple to produce intense aesthetic experience. The delight we derive from the scene of Halprin's Portland Fountain and the Piazza San Marco (Figures 1 and 2) can be attributed to the openness of the place to people. In fact, like a traditional Japanese residence, it is presence of people that completes and defines the place: it is the people's use that shapes a space into a room with a particular function. That such multi- sensory interaction intensifies the aes- thetic experience is perhaps the crux of both environmental aesthetics and recent phenomenological theories of environmental perception. An environ- ment of high aesthetic quality thus supports the physiological, perceptual, and cognitive needs for the senses of comfort, belonging, security, and conve- nience. It also involves, engages, and invites people, raising their sensitivity and awareness, and in doing so makes the environment humane and allows the participants to be fully human and mas- ters of their space. We must go beyond such visual criteria as human scale, human mor- phology, signs, and symbols. "Unity with people" also points to a holistic, dynamic interaction, involving "total sensory experience" as Rasmussen (1962) discussed and the "existential sixth sense" that Norberg- Schulz (1979) spoke of in his discussion of " sense of place" and phenomenology of architec- Figure 7.

It also means the involvement of the "unconscious," symbolizing ten- dency of humans that Jungian psychiatrists deal with (Koh 1983b). The built environment designed for all these modes, perceptual and somatic experience, produces intense and rich aesthetic experiences. The frequent sep- aration of beauty and meaning (e.g., formal aesthetics vs. symbolic aesthet- ics) in aesthetic discussion and environmental design theories is pri- marily for conceptual, operational convenience. The air, light, tempera- ture, aroma of plants, steepness of slope, archetypical imagery, actual and perceived openness of the environment to human control (e.g., windows that open; inviting path, entrance, and stair; movable furniture; localized environ- mental control systems), void, and even ambiguity, invite people to participate and give them a sense of control and belonging, which, in turn, seems to give users and observers a sense of freedom and a greater sense of security, comfort and pleasure. The charm of a kaleidoscope is partly due to the fact that the viewer produces the variation. The Parthenon and Villa Rotunda are in unity with their context in terms of a cognitive model of the universe via geometry and number. The unity in this case is essential and abstract. The Kat- sura in Japan, Falling Water in Pennsylvania, and Sea Ranch in Cal- ifornia, like ordinary indigenous architecture of many cultures, show unity with landscape in ways that are ecological, existential, and concrete. In the Rotunda, the aesthetic unity with landscape was cognitive and abstract; in the Katsura it remains perceptual and experimential. Both in the Katsura and Falling Water, walls become integrating as well as isolating elements. The domi- nance of voids (volume), rather than the architecture of solids (form), also tends to enhance the integrity and continuity between building and garden, the indoor/outdoor interpénétration. The buildings at Katsura and Falling Water are incomplete without their landscapes. Inclusive unity with place gener- ates such qualities as a sense of harmony with landscape; enhancement of iden- tity with its site, and richness and imageability of place; openness to the garden, landscape, and universe beyond; fitness to the quality and the carrying capacity of each ecological zone; and responsiveness to the street and community. The interface between indoor and outdoor becomes an impor- tant aesthetic experience and design focus more than either "indoor" or "out- door." The "Engawa," the veranda area of Japanese houses, and the porch and forecourt in American houses articulate the transition between "here" and "there." An articulated transition helps to ameliorate the stress people uncon- sciously experience as they move from the familiar and secure "here" to the strange and challenging "there." In Jap- anese houses, the horizontal continuity is counterbalanced by the articulated change of materials and floor levels. Spadai integration with territorial artic- ulation and differentiation thus seems to produce pleasant transition and thus a pleasing aesthetic experience. When buildings, gardens, and landscapes are in unity with place, as when they are in unity with people, they become alive: they change with climate and produce a dynamic event of total perceptual experience instead of remaining static visual "things" of dis- tant observation. The sound, aroma, heat and coolness, breeze, as well as the sight of changing landscape and weather conditions, make buildings alive and livable and the human experi- ence of them aesthetic. As the garden changes through the seasons, the build- ing integrated with it changes, too. The air-conditioned, windowless (or fixed- window) room is both static and unheal- thy. It eliminates the full experience of change and changeability and limits relatedness to the larger and more per- manent natural order that gives meaning and value to human life. Indif- ferent to the occupants of the room, it also tends to be alienating and inhu- mane. The building that permits adjustability by its inhabitants often results in the expressive variations of closing and opening of windows and blinds. Likewise, urban open space with movable chairs invites people to create their place and, as such, the place becomes alive and human. One important principle of basic design that supports inclusive unity with context is that of figure/ground : figure characteristics are affected by their interaction with ground, and one cannot perceive figure without ground. Seeing means seeing in context, and experienc- ing is then experiencing in field. Inclusive unity denies the distance and duality between the subject and the object, between humans and nature, between order and disorder. Exclusive unity has been a useful design principle to create such qualities of form and structure as proportion, symmetry, viv- idness, organic wholeness, intent without purpose, and pervasiveness, as well as theme and variation. Inclusive unity of built structure with people and place explains these same qualities and, furthermore, reflects contextual har- mony and empathy. Dynamic Balance Dynamic Balance as a Principle of the Creative Process The principle of balance in tradi- tional aesthetics refers to the state of quantitative equilibrium between opposing forces, quantities, masses, and weights. It is a balance in the appearance of form, or what Arnheim (1954) has called "psychological force" that one experiences in the perception of form in works of art. As a basic design princi- ple, "balance" in the traditional sense refers to the static balance of form, to equilibrium in the development of a sys- tem; it is static in that it implies the desirability of maintaining an existing state. But there is a different kind of balance: adynamic, qualitative, bal- ance between opposing principles and qualities. This differs from the static, asymmetric balance of form in that it is a dynamic asymmetry of process. This principle works in many self-organizing systems, in processes of nature and human development, and has been extensively discussed (Jantsch 1975, Prigogine 1976, Koh 1983a). In both artistic and scientific creativity, spon- taneous ideation and inspiration must be balanced by orderly, disciplined aes- thetic and intellectual judgment to produce innovative ideas and works. When the irrational unconscious meets the rational conscious, one becomes more likely to produce creative solu- tions, solutions that are not only "original," but "workable," not only aesthetic, but economic (Koh 1981 , 1983b). Such evolutionary principles of creativity suggest that we must reject the dualistic notion of creativity (between imagination and reasoning, feeling and 184 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="9">Figure 8. Stepping Stones in the Garden of the Heian Shrine, Kyoto. The stepping stones, by being in unity with people, invite their functional and aesthetic participation and thus help to form a place that produces a dynamic aesthetic experience. The stepping stones are also "completed" by the people. Source: Photograph by Jusuck Koh, 1979. Figure 9. Interior of the Shokin-tei Tea Room, Katsura Imperial Villa, Kyoto. The irregular post at the center symbolizes imperfection and changeability as the essence of life. The balance between this irregularity and the regularity of the room surface and space is dynamic and quali- tative.

Most of all, this evolutionary approach offers a dynamic view of reality and an understanding of creativity in terms of qualitative balance in process . The principle of dynamic balance requires a shift in the focus of designers away from the traditional ordering of "form" following positivistic aesthetics, toward an ordering of "process." This is a more useful principle for today's designers who must deal with rapid change, who must make decisions under uncertain circumstances, and who must create designs that c^n adapt to future needs. This principle also reflects the newly emerging holistic view of the world; order and disorder, control and freedom are seen not as mutually antag- onistic and separate but as complementary and indivisible. Order and disorder are relative not only to each other but to purpose and context. Dynamic Balance as an Aesthetic Principle Dynamic balance (of process and quality) explains many aesthetic experi- ences and qualities that static balance (of form and quantity) cannot. By deal- ing with the process of creation, dynamic balance accounts for the very processes of perception, cognition, and aesthetic experience, all of which are creative processes. Seeing and knowing are pro- cesses of recognizing and organizing patterns; so is cognitive development. Cognitive development thus usually leads to a balance between subjective, ego-centered views and objective, ego- transcending views of the environment. The juxtaposition of organic and inorganic lines and forms in the works of Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, and the Japanese mannerist designs of houses and gardens also can be explained better by this principle of dynamic, qualitative balance. To call such a state "contradiction," as Robert Venturi has, reflects a dualistic view of the world. The creative mind, like the creative process itself, has always sought the resolution of apparent contradictions in images and ideas. Such a search seems to be a driving force for creative endeavor in both art and science. Counterpoint in Bach's music comes closest to such a dynamic balance in Western art, or "Hacho" (breaking harmony to make it even more apparent) in Japanese aesthetics. Proving why dynamic balance intensifies aesthetic experience is not easy. One can speculate, however, that the apparent sense of disorder gives a sense of freedom and spontaneity, whereas order produces a sense of con- trol and economy. As such, aesthetic theory, built upon dynamic balance as a principle, may account for responses by humans both in their natural and cultural, unconscious and conscious, sensuous and intellectual, irrational and rational, romantic and classical aspects. It expresses and perhaps Koh 185</page><page sequence="10">Figure 10. Entrance to Alvar Aalto's Museum, Jyväskylä, Finland. The irregular line between the marble and the bronze gate is for aesthetic, not functional, effect. This balance of order and disorder reduces the formality and thus the distancing effect.

Much vernacular architecture reveals such balance between local (or partial) symmetry and overall assyme- try (or vice versa). Such buildings express the gradual evolutionary growth and adaptation over the life of the structure. Expansion of farmhouses and barns express such a quality. Jap- anese houses often show through their additions a balance between order in a part (i.e., the tatami grass mat) and disorder in a whole, between local symmetry and overall asymmetry. Dynamic balance points to both qualitative asymmetry derived from the process of creation and the formal asymmetry embodied in the aesthetic form. Thus, this principle integrates the static, formal balance of Western aes- thetics with the dynamic, qualitative balance of Eastern aesthetics. And this is why ecological aesthetics may be symbolized by the overlapping of da Vinci's ideal man with a yin-yang symbol. Complementarity Complementarity as a Principle of the Creative Process The principle of complementarity refers as much to the nature of order as to the order of nature; it reflects not only the complementarity within natu- ral systems, but also a new concept or order between our subjective "selves" and the objective world. As a third principle in this ecological theory of design, it reflects both the holistic view of the world and the integrative nature of creativity. It is a world view that reflects modern physics (Einstein's the- ories of relativity, Heisenberg^ principle of uncertainty, Bohr's theory of complementarity), which has the fundamental epistemological signifi- cance relating to the indivisibility and complementarity between subject and object, time and space, void and solid (Capra 1975), and many other forms of dualism such as form and content, matter and mind, energy and informa- tion, romanticism and classicism, feeling and thought, unconscious and conscious. In the creative processes of bio- logical systems, the male and female usually must complement to repro- duce. The human brain, in its creative process, integrates the left brain func- tion with that of the right brain and the conscious with the unconscious. Like- wise, complementarity exists between thought and feeling, idea and image, body and mind, logic and intuition, and unity and balance. Creative per- sons are often characterized by their ability to see things of seeming contra- diction in harmonious relationship and by their tolerance of tentative disorder and ambiguity. Likewise, the creative process is an integration of seeming dualistic elements in a complementary manner. Art is indeed a biological phe- nomenon as Read (1958) once noted. This principle points to interrelated- ness between the aesthetics of art works and the aesthetics of natural form. Both cultural evolution and indi- vidual human development reveal the complementarity between physical/per- ceptual adaptation and symbolic/ cognitive adaptation. In cultures where material goods, resources, and space are limited, physiological discomfort is often compensated by assigning greater emphasis to spiritual values and aes- thetic appreciation. Similarly, old persons may compensate for lack of physical strength with wisdom. An organism's ecological "niche," which is its place in time and space of the bio- logical community, is at least partially the result of a creative evolution involv- ing interchange of time and space for efficient resource utilization. Likewise, spatial thinking complements sequen- tial thinking in the human creative process. Creative solutions in architecture and landscape architecture usually work with nature rather than against it, letting nature and landscape comple- ment humans and building. Garden and landscape thus complement and complete the building in the Japanese house as well as in Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water and Alvar Aalto's buildings. This accomplishes more with less, a secret of many cre- ative solutions. Likewise, many crea- tive environmental designs demon- strate the complementary between form and content and between conscious and unconscious experience of them. So much of our language and concepts are the products of, and are colored by, Western dualism. Whereas our idea of space has no connection with time, the Japanese word "Ma," 1 86 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="11">the English "room," and the German "raum," refer both to space and time. Yet it is difficult to explain the comple- mentarity principle without inventing new terms or hyphenating two words. And then one realizes an inherent problem with our language: it tends to separate and differentiate. How much our dualistic thinking is the result of such a dichotomized language, or vice versa, is therefore difficult to assess.9 There is evidence that the language we learn affects the physical operation of our brain (Sibatani 1980). Complementarity as an Aesthetic Principle The interaction of positive and negative forms as an ordering principle is now a well-known and widely-used forming principle of basic design, but one not easily explained by the princi- ples of unity or balance or any aesthetic theory of positivistic, formalistic orien- tation. This may be because positivistic formal aesthetics by nature focuses its attention on forms rather than the space in or between forms. This, how- ever, can be explained by the principle of complementarity. Beauty too can be defined as a complementary fusion between what Arnheim (1954) called "clarity of expression" in formal order and "richness and meaning" (relevant content). When the beautiful and the meaningful - form and content - are integrated, aesthetic experience is likely to be more intense, perhaps because human perception and cogni- tion are mutually complementary and indivisible, and because humans have an instinctive tendency to simplify and symbolize. Formal aesthetics and sym- bolic aesthetics are thus neither mutually exclusive nor separable, par- ticularly when the meaning is derived from "archetypical" symbols commu- nicating to our unconscious natural selves (e.g., water, rock, etc.). Eros and beauty, for example, are indivisibly integrated in the classical image Venus and in the Virgin Mary and in Kwan Yin of Buddhism. In a built environment, the indoor/outdoor continuity, building and garden, complement each other in enhancing aesthetic experience as well as increasing a sense of orientation, rootedness, and "placeness." Likewise, the interpénétration of the solid and the void make an aesthetic quality per- vasive, as the integration of the whold the articulation of the detail comple- ment each other. The Kat sura Villa, Falling Water, Aalto's buildings, Kevin Roche's designs, Kahn's Kimbell Museum, and even Portman's hotels take their charm principally from the complementarity between building and garden, from void and negative form working as a unifying element. The plan of the Ohara House of Japan shows how a garden reaches into the building and the building into the gar- den. The aesthetic quality produced by the harmony of building with land- scape, as noted earlier, is not explained by phenomenological theory. This qual- ity may be better explained by the Figure 1 1 . Design Based on Positive and Negative Forms. The positive and negative complement each other to create a whole and bring about total perceptual par- ticipation. It is people who complete the incomplete forms within a whole. It is people who decide what to look at between the positive and the negative. Source: Photograph by Jusuck Koh, 1984. Figure 12. Stone Arrangement in the Moss Garden of Tofuku-ji Temple, Kyoto. The interaction between the positive and negative form and the balance between the order of stone shape and the disorder or broken diagonals of stone arrangement enhance the aesthetic quality. The ambiguity of dominance between stone and moss invites the viewer's participation, thus heightening the aesthetic experience. Source: Photograph by Jusuck Koh, 1982.

The aesthetic experience one gains from traditional Japanese houses and their rituals (tea ceremony and Noh drama) seems to come from the complementarity between formal ele- gance and spiritual significance, par- ticularly the rich natural/psychic sym- bolism that communicates with the col- lective unconscious. Presence of mean- ing in an event or thing establishes a relationship between people and environment, allowing symbol-making Homo sapiens to function and partici- pate fully. Likewise, using natural material in building is more than an ecological/economical means for mate- rial and energy savings: it creates the richness and expressiveness of natural form and projects its natural sym- bolism into human consciousness or evolutionary consciousness (Koh 1983b). Most of all, the meaning gives significance to our lives and existence, and relates us to our territories and habitats. Design must not only delight our senses and body to generate intense aesthetic experience - it must also enlighten our soul and mind and raise the awareness and sensitivity of self and environment instead of just prompting easy gratification. Most of all, it must help integrate Eros and Logos in ourselves. Design and art can produce such integrating experiences, raising the awareness of our own aes- thetic sensitivity and the spiritual value of life. The complementarity view also brings together Western formal aesthet- ics (which focus on the objective, external world and on the clarity of expression and the ordering of complex environments) and Oriental nega- tivistic aesthetics (which focus on the subjective, internal world; on sensual expressiveness; and the symbolic, exis- tential experience of nature). It also brings together architecture and land- scape architecture, and most of all the energy/material realm and informa- tion/spiritual aspects of ecological design as a holistic design. Many posi- tivistic Western aesthetic theories of art works simply cannot explain natural landscape beauty or Oriental garden art (Callicott 1983). Although classical, formal, positivistic aesthetics of the Renais- sance contributed much, as Berleant (1970) notes, toward an object-cen- tered view of art and a hero-worship view of the artist and architect, it also created distance between the viewer and the work of art, between landscape and architecture. This distance can now be overcome by design and art that are guided by complementarity as an aesthetic principle. Conclusion: Value of Ecological Aesthetics The set of three interrelated, descriptive principles (inclusive unity, dynamic balance, and complemen- tarity) yield a general, descriptive theory that can help us to understand aspects of both fine and practical art, Western and Oriental art, architecture, and landscape architecture. It also serves as a useful basis for prescriptive design principles, expanding the classi- cal ordering principles so as to render them relevant to the design of the evolving, adaptive human-environ- ment system, or environmental structure. Ecological aesthetics also relates the theory of beauty to the theory of architecture and landscape architec- ture on one hand and the principles of design on the other. But aesthetic response is not a monoply of artists and designers. The prevalent tendency of portraying architecture and garden without people or context seems insep- arably related to the tradition of eval- uating and awarding designs without the evaluations of users; they are sim- ply different but interrelated manifes- tations of positivistic aesthetics and design. Just as participatory design has been advocated for ethical reasons, intellectual reasons, and operational expediency, so the participatory aspect of ecological aesthetics provides an aes- thetic vindication of both participatory design and ecological design. Ecologi- cal aesthetics thus points to a new inclusive aesthetics, which has three important defining characteristics: par- ticipatory, phenomenological, and environmental. Each of these aspects is related to specific problems that mod- ern designers must address. Ecological aesthetics constitute an inclusive para- digm that deals with the total percep- tual experience (rather than the exclusively visual); it sees humans and environment as a system. It is an evo- lutionary paradigm because its focus is as much on the ordering of the non-</page><page sequence="13">Figure 14. Plan of the Ohara House. The architecture and garden interpenetrate. The absence of solid walls between them strengthens the unity and complementarity between them. The transition between indoor and outdoor is articulated by veranda space, change of level, and floor materials. Thus, articulation of the parts and integration of the whole are realized. The architecture also shows balance between local order and overall disorder.

Many criticisms of modern envi- ronmental design and designers have been aimed at the elitist attitude of designers and the alienating effect of modern buildings. It is now clear that many of these shortcomings are at least partly attributable to reductionistic, formal aesthetics built upon a dualistic view of humans and environment. Designers of the environment now need an integrative aesthetic that is compati- ble with holistic design for humane, contextual, and participatory environ- ments. Ecological aesthetics meets this challenge. Notes 1 . Environmental design, however, can mean more than the design of the environment. It can also mean a holistic and dynamic approach to design, or the design of the human-environment system encompassing both ecological and human, or contextual as well as phenomenol- ogical concerns. This holistic approach to design can be called "ecological design." Environmental aesthetics, too, seems to have two significances: (1) aesthetics of the environment, a quantitative extension of positivistic aesthetics of form as applied to the aesthetics of large environment or of its appearance, and (2) ecological aesthetics, a holistic, evolutionary aesthetics of the environ- ment, as has been effectively articulated by Berleant in his concept of "aesthetic field" applied to works of art as well as to the built environment (Berleant 1970, 1983). 2. The first problem is directly related to the problem of modern art and environmental design, to their alienating effect, and to the per- vasive and socially disintegrating split between high art and popular art, between form and con- tent and between thought and feeling. Geometry, being both conceptual and perceptual, offered a useful basis for design in the past, linking science and art. However, formalism built upon geome- try has lost meaning, just as geometry itself, like numbers, has lost its qualitative, symbolic mean- ing in contemporary culture. 3. Aestheticians have never claimed "major" sta- tus within philosophy, and aesthetics frequently has been treated as a stepchild of both philoso- phy and psychology (Dickie and Schlafani 1979). This is perhaps partly because aestheticians address qualitative, experiential issues that tend to be neglected by the positivistic-minded philos- opher and scientist. Architecture or environ- mental design, on the other hand, has tradi- tionally been a skill-oriented profession. Even when the formal education of architects was established with the Ecoles des Beaux Arts, its knowledge bases were borrowed and surrogate, in that analogical thinking dominated their dis- course and theories. This tradition, emphasizing skill over theory, lasted through the Bauhaus and appears to linger even today, with negative attitudes toward "academics" and "theoreti- cians." The design disciplines as a whole may be said still to remain atheoretical and to suffer from a lack of disciplined theoretical inquiry and from a dualistic view of theory and design. Environ- mental designers still seem to rely too heavily upon history and metaphor as a source of knowl- edge and to remain suspicious of theoretical inquiry. The science (or theory) of architecture and design and environmental aesthetics may even be regarded only as a nascent one. This situation is compounded by the ongoing change from an industrial culture to a post-industrial culture and from a reductionistic world view to a holistic world view. Yet these have radical implications for the theory and practice of both aesthetic and design disciplines. Both architec- ture and aesthetic disciplines are now beginning to reject positivistic paradigms (formalistic aes- thetics in philosophy, functionalistic design in architecture), yet both remain in a transitional phase, without the core body of a new knowledge system formulated and shared widely by mem- bers of the disciplines. Another important reason why modern aesthetics has become so incomprehensible to designers is perhaps due to the fact that most aesthetic debates among philosophers have been characterized by infighting, arguing reflectively (using "concepts") against each other's ideas and interpretation of art works, rather than dealing with the empirical aesthetic events, precepts, and "aesthetic experience" of art works as facts (Berleant 1970). Even today, the Journal of Aesthet- ics and Art Criticism of the American Society of Aesthetics seems to have an editorial policy not to include pictures and illustrations in its journal. Environmental designers may be equally vul- nerable to such criticisms in that many of their design issues and theories have so little to do with the pressing social problems (such as human alienation and social disintegration) and signifi- cant philosophical issues (reductionism vs. holism, determinism vs. evolutionism, mate- rialism vs. humanism) of today's world. In fact, there are still too many designers who bypass discussion of social reality in the name of time- lessness and the universal or out of their despairing recognition of the limitation of the roles designers play in improving our built environmment. 4. In addition, it is said that to understand a theory, one must understand the problems that the theoretician saw and intended to address. Human alienation and environmental insen- sitivity in modern art and design are regarded as major problems, and find their cause in its aes- thetic basis. Having understood the cause and significance of such a gap, one must find a way to bridge the gap through a theoretical synthesis. Such theoretical synthesis now seems to be both viable and necessary. 5. For an aesthetic theory to be a general and inclusive theory of aesthetic experience, as opposed to "aesthetics" of a special mode of experience, it must be able to account for the following: (a) Western as well as oriental art works (Munro 1965); Western positivistic aesthetics as well as oriental negati vistic aesthetics; (b) The aesthetics of fine arts, as well as primitive, indigenous arts, or modern vernacular design; Koh 189</page><page sequence="14">(c) Artistic as well as natural beauty; creativity of nature/matter as well as of human nature/mind. This is particularly important for the aesthetics to be useful for landscape architec- ture because our experience of environment does not stop at the building (Callicott 1983); (d) Visual/audio experience as well as total mode perceptions including somatic, body- sense experience, and conscious as well as uncon- scious perceptions (Berleant 1970); (e) Formal as well as symbolic beauty; perception of the object as well as of the environ- ment in general; (f) Art appreciation as well as artistic creativity; the creative/artistic process as well as the creative artistic product, aesthetic awareness as well as self-awareness (Blatt 1984). Classical and most modern aesthetic theo- ries do not satisfy all of these requirements (Callicott 1983). Moreover, an aesthetic focused on "the aesthetics of appearance" relies on reflec- tive discussion with analytic ideas and concepts to discuss essentially synaesthetic images, per- ceptions, and experiences: the gap between concept and precepts is apparent. Attention has been focused more often on attributes, elements (color, line, texture, etc.), and products rather than on variables (purpose, context, perceiver, etc.), wholes, and processes. These tendencies may be attributed to a static, mechanistic view of the world, which was acceptable when design purpose and context were not diverse and the social value system was relatively homogeneous. 6. Creativity refers to "the quality of being cre- ative" and to "the ability to create," which predicates the definition of "to create." To create in ordinary English means "to make one out of nothing for the first time, " (e.g., Genesis), "to produce (as a work of art or dramatic interpreta- tion) along new and unconventional lines," or "to make or bring into existence something new; invent" (Webster's Third International Dictionary). Creativity, according to architects Koberg and Bagnali (1972, p. 8) is "both the art and the science of thinking and behaving with both sub- jectivity and objectivity." Or creativity can be simply "an integration or transcendent of polar- ities, " or "free play of imagination of logical structure of form" (Florisha 1978). These definitions tend to relate to human creativity as well as emphasizing newness, invention , and originality. In this paper, I adopt an inclusive definition of creativity. I include invention as well as adaptation, human as well as natural, developmental as well as evolutionary, self-conscious as well as unself-conscious system processes. Thus, creativity is defined here as an ability and quality leading to an increased level of order, and thus in the level of interrelationship, complexity, effi- ciency, diversity, stability, adaptability , meaning, value, awareness, and spirituality of a system. This assump- tion toward a heightened level of organization may sound positivistic, progressive, and linear in thinking. However, as evidenced from later dis- cussion of dynamic balance of order and disorder, creative process is recognized to involve temporary disintegration and regression. I, how- ever, admit being "positive" in my belief that creative process by its definition must lead to an increased level of organization until the system reaches a climax and equalibrium state, which in turn can be perturbed or discontinued abruptly. 7. The essence of Einstein's profundity was its sheer simplicity and his sense of beauty. Einstein spoke "unabashedly of aesthetic appeal, of beauty and harmony in certain concepts of classi- cal physics" (Curtis 1982, p. 241). 8. The term evolution, used here, is differenti- ated from Darwinian or historical evolutionism and Marxist materialistic dialectic. The Prigoginian evolution, stretching Mayr's Neo- Darwinian evolution, recognizes the place of dis- order and chance and thus discontinuity, unpredictability, indeterminacy. However, in my search for a general theory of aesthetics I share Einstein's positive faith in the presence of order in the universe and his belief that God did not throw dice to create this universe - a belief that sustained his search for a unified field theory (Curtis 1982, p. 241). After all, the belief in the presence of order in nature, and our instinctual desire and survival need for ordering (be they in our mind or in the external world) provide a fun- damentad reason for the existence of science, art, religion, design, and for my own search. Yet this search for order should not be confused as a "dualistic" attitude that negates the role of disor- der and irrationality in the creative process. 9. The Chinese language is more visual and con- textual; ideas are related to images, and the meaning of a word changes as its relationship to the syntax changes. It also tends to focus more on process and quality than does English. The vari- ations in adjectives and adverbs also seem to be much greater than in abstract concepts as com- pared to English (Glahn 1973). References Arnheim, Rudolf. 1954.
