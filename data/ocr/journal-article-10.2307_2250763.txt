<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. General Biology and Philosophy of Organism. By RALPH STAYNER LILLIE. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; London: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1945. Pp. 215. The Directiveness of Organic Activities. By E. S. RUSSELL. London Cambridge University Press, 1945. Pp. viii + 196. 8s. 6d. THE first of these books is a full, careful but rather difficult philosophical discussion of the conception of the living organism by a leading American biologist. The second contains less discussion and is chiefly valuable for making accessible a number of the queer, almost incredible, facts which biological observers are constantly reporting and which theorists with ready-made explanations prefer to ignore. One specially intriguing example given by Dr. Russell is the behaviour of a small freshwater flat-worm, Microstoma. It attacks the (for it) formidable coelenterate Hydra, not so much for its flesh as for the ne-ma- tocysts, or stinging cells, Hydra possesses in its skin. Although the function of the nematocysts is to explode on. contact and discharge their contents, Microstoma manages to swallow them intact. They are not digested, but absorbed whole and carried to the skin, where they are planted in an orderly way. These borrowed weapons then serve to protect Microstoma from its enemies. When Microstoma has obtained a normal complement of nematocysts it loses interest in Hydra, but, if very hungry, will eat one, digesting the rest of the flesh but spitting out the nematocysts. The American observers who studied Microstoma kept some out of contact with Hydra for several generations and then fed them with a special type (Chlorohydra viridissima) possessing four different kinds of nematocyst. Microstoma digested those wbich protrude adhesive threads and which would have been useless, keeping for use the two more ordinary kinds with poisoned darts. Microstoma possesses nothing that can be called a brain, and only the most rudimentary sense organs. Two further points should be mentioned in connection with this story. There are plenty of other species of freshwater flat-worm which do not borrow nematocysts and yet survive. There are quite unrelated marine organisms which have a similar habit of borrowing nematocysts for protection. As Dr. Russell says (p. 25) to interpret these facts we require the concepts of need, normal end-state or goal, and directive activity towards attainment of goal. In the acccunt just given I have used, for sake of brevity, more anthropomorphic language which could have been avoided; but those three notions could not be dispensed with. The value of queer and unfamiliar examples like that of Microstoma is merely to shock one into seeing the factors involved. The very familiarity of familiar examples tends to conceal them. Professor Lillie tries to make these factors clearer. His account is not easy to summarize, so that my attempt is stated in my terms not his, and I have also introduced what seems to me a slight improvement which he might reject. As will be immediately obvious, his theory owes much to the philosophy of Whitehead.</page><page sequence="2">358 NEW BOOKS. The natural world everywhere presents two aspects, constancy and change. Thus the constant velocity of light is a type of primordial or underived constancy; the constant reaction velocities of chemical com- pounds are types of consequent or derivative constancy, a residue remaining from previous change, which produced the compounds. In this second case, it is easy to see there is constancy of 'stuff ' as well as constancy of relation. Older thinkers tended to take constancy of 'stuff ' as primary and that of relation as secondary, for no very good reason. There is no ' stuff ' at all in the more fundamental constant, the velocity of light, unless Space-Time is ' stuff '. Whatever may be thought of the notion of' stuff' or of 'substance ', the notion of 'structure ' cannot be dispensed with; that is to say, the framework of constant relations within which occurs change or process, or function in the biological sense; and without which we should not find order in change. Most process is routine process, but, potentially at least, it is novelty, freedom, creativity. The physical sciences are concerned with discovering and determining constancy, whether of structure or of routine in process. When incon- stancy is found the physicist puts it aside as chance, randomness or en- tropy. Because of the nature of his purpose and method he does not take account of a third possibility, namely, directed, non-random inconstancy. Professor Lillie suggests (pp. 22, 80, 132) that the kind of inconstancy found at the sub-atomic level may be significant for biological processes. (Schroedinger does so too in What Is Life ? 1944. But against the view, see I. Manton, " Comments on Chromosome Structure," Nature, Vol. 155, p. 471, 1945.) It is perhaps more likely that the smallest unit processes and structures of living things are too large for randomness at the level of the electron to be significant. If the smallest living unit involves a million electrons, their randomness or indeterminacy averages out. What almost certainly is significant is randomness at the molecular level, the random heat motion of atoms and molecules. For this reason, the analogy of human contrivances, like machines, seems to me even more valuable than it does to Professor Lillie. The analogy must not be pressed too far, however, because biological units are small relative to man-made structures, and show discontinuities of a kind not seen on the larger scale. Consider a simple contrivance whose function is that of controlling or directing, an ordinary gas-tap. It consists of barrel and key, both rigid bodies; that is to say, within limits they are constant and determined in character. They wear out by friction in course of time; slow chemical changes may occur; the atoms composing the metal are in random heat motion; but all these things are negligible from the point of view of the tap's function over a reasonable period. Thus, each of the two metal parts may be taken as rigid and determined. In contrast, the relation between key and barrel is loose, inconstant, undetermined; from the point of view of strict physical theory, random. If the key fits so tight that it cannot be turned, the tap is useless; if it is so loose as to wobble, the tap is also useless; the looseness must be within limits. The looseness is quite clearly associated with random heat motions of atoms or molecules. The metal is rigid because heat motion is confined to oscillation about a centre. In the matter between the metal surfaces (air, moisture, grease and what-not) heat motion is not so confined; there is fluidity. There is some slight inter-atomic locking (static friction), so that a finite pressure is required to move the tap. When that pressure is exceeded and the tap moves, the molecular picture of the heat motions of the matter between</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 359 the metal surfaces changes from the purelv random to flow in one direction or the other. After the tap is turned it becomes purely random again. All mechanically operating controlling devices depend upon the same principle, that a small imposed force temporarily turns random molecular heat motion into directional flow within a system otherwise rigid. The principle includes electro-magnetic contrivances controlled by switches, keys, microphones, photo-electric or chemical processes, as well as the more obvious levers, pistons, valves, ratchets, hammers, triggers, and so on. The central nervous system of the higher animals is not entirely unlike man-made controlling devices. It contains one " rigid " part, the white matter, where nervous processes are insulated from one another and each follows a predetermined path. In the " loose " or " fluid " part, the grey matter, nervous processes are not insulated and the path probably not always predetermined. It may be guessed, however, that the controlling factor of directional flow is superimposed, not on purely random motion, but on some kind of 'fluid' order. To return to the tap; there is nothing in its structure to determine if it is shut or open; it can be either. The physicist in devising his theoretical constructions may concern himself with what happens when the tap is open or when it is closed, but need not be interested in the opening or closing as such, nor why these acts are performed. The act of control can always be excluded from physical theory and must be excluded if theory is concerned with constancy. Inconstancy can always be treated as random process. The biologist has no need to submit himself to such limitations. It is part of his task to discover the constant conditions and routine processes of living organisms; and while he uses the experimental method it is bound to be these he sees most prominently. But if there is evidence of controlling factors at work he should acknowledge them. The acknow- ledgment, if properly made, does not contradict anything said about constant conditions; any more than the physicist contradicts his own physical theories when he turns on a gas tap in his laboratory. The trouble is, not to acknowledge the directive process, but how to deal with it when acknowledged. The old notions of ' animal spirits ' and ' vital force ' were obscurantist, if not self-contradictory, because they supposed a kind of matter not quite material or a kind of force not quite physical. Professor Lillie adopts the simplest course of using the analogy of human purpose and initiative. It has the advantage that we are acquainted to some extent with the working of our own purposes. It has the disadvantage that it may lead to our reading into the processes of lower organisms characters quite alien to them, belonging solely to our own mental life; in short, it may lead to the vicious sort of anthropomorphism. Before condemning it for this, it is well to consider the alternatives. First, there is the theory that living organisms are no more than complex mechanical systems, and that chance and natural selection have brought them to their present condition. As against this theory: if everything anthropomorphic is to be condemned the notion of chance will hardly bear scrutiny, unless it just stands for ignorance. In that case, the theory is not really a theory. As to natural selection: it explains very well how unsuitable types have perished but hardly explains how the survivors have come to be as they are. In the case of Microstoma, just quoted, only a completed co-ordinated process confers an advantage; single parts of it are no help. It is no use Microstoma swallowing nematocysts unless they are conveyed to the right place. Unless they are being swallowed, how can arrangements for</page><page sequence="4">360 NEW BOOKS. conveying them develop ? Of course, the supporter of chance and natural selection gets over the difficulties by inventing ad hoc hypotheses to explain what happens at each stage; a method that will save the worst possible theory. Another alternative which seems more promising uses the Aristotelian notion of a hierarchy of forms. The lowest stage is the inorganic realm where chance and mechanical causes operate alone. Above that is the vegetative realm where a certain order is imposed on what would otherwise be chaotic, namely, the minimum required for growth and reproduction of the lower organisms. The order is teleological, because growth and reproduction are processes directed towards ends, but it is limited or mini- mum teleology. Above the vegetative realm are higher ones where the vegetative order still operates but where there are superimposed higher orders required for higher animal functions. Finally, there is the highest known order, that required for intelligence. This kind of theory is not to be dismissed lightly. It suffers, however, from a conspicuous weakness, probably shared by any alternative theory not purely mechanical. When we ask what in fact constitutes the order or form of the vegetative realm or any below the highest one, the answer is given in terms derived from human experience and purpose. Or else it is a worse answer in pseudo- mechanical, pseudo-psychological terms, like 'vital fcrce '; or else it falls back on mechanics, chance and natural selection. In short, Aristotelian theory is not so much an alternative theory as a special, more complicated version of Professor Lillie's. Perhaps then, we have just to treat the formative, ordering or directive factor as if it were psychic and take the analogy of human contrivances seriously. There is an interesting paradox here. Men most conspicuously exercise their freedom of choice in designing, making and using machines. Every experiment, measurement or controlled observation in science is both an act of choice and the use of a machine. Yet it is from contemplat- ing machines and the consequences of scientific observation that men have arrived at the notion of mechanical causation and have developed deter- ministic theories denying human freedom. This shows that, as Kant put it, mechanism and teleology are incompatible if taken as constitutive principles; while they are complementary if taken (as they should be) as regulative merely. This still leaves the last and most difficult question, as to which Professor Lillie, following Whitehead, does no more than provide a useful hint (pp. 107, 191, 205-207). Physical science is cognisant of a temporal order of past events which is taken to be permanent, but is not cognisant of the transient present of consciousness. This transient factor is one element of human consciousness, which contains also an element of the permanent ; so that the mind may be said to be the cross-section of the two. Let us suppose that every living thing is at a similar cross-section. The special human privilege is to have a sort of double view. In action the transient is experienced as such-, and as present, but it is contemplated as though past. The permanent in conscious recollection is taken as though present; it also forms the habitual basis of action. At lower levels there may be a single view only and yet a cross-section. This account does not solve the problem, but may help to avoid the fallacy of reading into lower life-pro- cesses factors which are not there, while admitting directiveness and dealing with it in terms borrowed from psychology.

A COMPLETE theory of knowledge, according to Father Hawkins, com- prises two groups of questions. First, the strictly philosophical part of logic, that is, the nature of thinking and of judgment, the validity of uni- versals, the scope of implication and of reasoning. For this, a foundation of formal logic is required and could with advantage be learned in school. The second group of questions is about what sort of things we are able to know and how we come to know them. Here we test the credentials of the kind of knowledge which common sense takes for granted-we try to make a systematic criticism of experience. Father Hawkins' book deals with this second group of questions and is intended as a text-book for Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. It is, of course, clear that the author believes that philosophy can do much more than criticise experience: he holds that such a criticism is a foundation for the rest- We have then an enquiry about how we can know material objects and other minds and what we can know about ourselves. And these familiar questions are tackled along the familiar lines. The author first decides that there is nothing in the nature of knowing to confine us to the knowledge of the self: knowing is, " of its nature, a way of escape from subjectivity, from the fatality by which you are merely what you yourself are. You cannot be more than you are, but you can know things other than yourself " (p. 12). Nevertheless, reflection shows us that in mere sensation we do not in fact transcend the self: sense-data are (of course) unequivocally real, but they are subjective- states of the self and no more. They are not given as copies of anything else, and if they were the only objects of direct acquaintance, we should at best only be able to infer causally the existence of other things in the world beside the self. It is true that a world could be constructed out of the sense-data themselves, but it would be a subjective world. Now the causal inference to an objective world could not make sense if there were nothing of which we had direct non-inferential knowledge: for there would then be nothing against which our inferences could be tested. " Much, doubtless, of our knowledge of the external world is inferential, but it can scarcely all be inferential " (93). The author therefore argues that We can and do have direct acquaintance with objects other than the self, and that this knowledge is non-sensuous. By a careful examination of the " conditions of perception " it is shown that we are aware of external things as agencies which (together with the rnind itself) produce sensations in us. Hence we a-re directly aware (1) of the states of our own mind (which include sense-data); (2) of independent external objects; and (3) of a causal connexion between these two. The general plan of the argument used to establish these conclusions, is to exhibit the limitations of mere sensation, one by one. We are asked to recognise that sensation alone cannot explain our notion of three- dimensional space, our notion of duration, our notion of the unity of the self, our knowledge of past time, and our knowledge of other extended bodies and of other minds. It must not be inferred that the book is written round a negative thesis: on the contrary, the point of the book is that on all these subjects we do have genuine knowledge; that, although some of our judgments on these subjects are dubious, they cannot all be dubious and they cannot all be inferential.</page><page sequence="6">362 NEW BOOKS. With regard to space, Father Hawkins rejects the view that our notion is derived from the data of sight and touch. Sight gives us only two dimensions: the data of touch are seen, on reflection, not to be extensive at all. We have, however, accompanying inner organic sensations, an intuition of the mass and volume of different parts of the body-an ex- tension in three dimensions whose parts and limits cannot be precisely known without the aid of symbols from the properties of things seen. The differences between this primitive consciousness and the visual symbolism of two-dimensional space, has somehow to account for mistakes in localisa- tion (55). In the last chapter of the book it is seen that this intuitive knowledge of our own body is continuous with a direct awareness of other bodies. For it is when there is contact between my body and others- when the mass of another body is compressing the mass of my own body- that I have direct acquaintance with external things. In such a situation I know that there is a real and independently existing thing there, and that it is acting on me to produce (in co-operation with the agency of the self) the sensation of pressure of which I am aware. In a parallel way, it is argued that in mere sensation we have knowledge only of what is present, but that where we have sensations continuing unchanged and realise that there might have been a change, there we have an intuition of duration. This is somehow the origin of our complex notion of time: presumably the " symbols " used are motion and the measure- ment of distances in two-dimensional space. Again, a later chapter shows that this intuition is continuous with an intuition of past time: it is, the author argues, impossible that all instances of memory should be inferential; we must, therefore, know directly both that there was a past, to which our memories (true or false) relate, and that in certain cases that past was the primary agent in producing the present memory. There must be direct memory-knowledge if only to provide a test for memory-inferences. The argument for the direct awareness of the self as substance follows a somewhat different line. First of all, if anything at all is real, sense-data are real; but since (it has been argued) these must be subjective, we can at least say that we have direct awareness of the successive states of the self. But does introspection discover nothing but the thinking itself ? Father Hawkins treats this question historically, showing how the merely logical subject gets confused with a merely linguistic device and gradually evaporates before the criticisms of Hume and others. For Hume, then, the whole world is composed of impressions and ideas, " objects which are very like universals in so far as they do not seem to contain any factor incapable of description in universal terms " (81). What is lacking is a principle of individual existence, and Father Hawkins shows that the original Aristotelian doctrine of substance is one which has real content: substance is a power, an appetite, a principle of agency. " It remains to be seen whether this notion of substance can be justified by experience and reflection ". Reflection shows that it can. I know myself as an active individual, not only in voluntary effort but in every sort of experience. Moreover, it is not the mind, but the embodied self, that is the substance. This awareness of the self as substance is of course closely connected with an awareness of other bodies as real and active individuals: both are in- tuited at once in perception: " The way in which one thing may in a certain sense be present in another is by causal determination. Awareness, being of its nature capable of transcending the subject, finds the possibility</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 363 of intuition in the causal presence of other things " ( 110). Here the notion of causality is brought in to help us through the difficulties of the notion of knowing. The author also holds (but does not argue in detail) that we oan cometimes have direct, non-inferential knowledge of other embodied selves. It might seem at first reading, as though these arguments made an extraordinary discrimination in favour of certain internal bodily sensations, as against the sensations of sight, hearing, etc. It might seem that the author was prepared to trust unreservedly in the stresses and strains of his muscles but to dismiss the data of the five senses as never anything but subjective. But this is not what Father Hawkins really says. There are, he says, certain bodily feelings of strain, effort, resistance, interplay and involvement of the several parts, and these feelings are invariably accompanied by an intuitive knowledge. And it is important to notice that he holds (with Whitehead and others) that the bodily feelings of strain and effort, are themselves invariably conjoined with sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. For they occur when the body is doing or suffering in any way whatever: though presumably they are usually too faint to be introspected without very special attention. So that the intuition is closely connected both with internal feelings of the body, and with the activity of the peripheral senses : but it is not itself a sensation or feeling of any kind. What we intuit, is the existence of things occupying neutral space and time, things having force, mass, "intrinsic motion ", things acting upon the embodied self, either now or in the past. There is, I believe, another important distinction to be made if the main thesis of the book is not to be misunderstood. The intuition is not sup- posed to be a mere knowledge that-as, for instance, I might have a direct intuition that q follows from p. I do indeed also have the knowledge that there is an external object acting upon me; and it is just because (in the author's view) nothing that I see, or touch, or hear, enables me to have this " knowledge that ", that he claims that I must have some kind of aware- ness that does not come to me through the senses. While it arises vividly along with certain bodily sensations, it is not itself sensational at all. But these distinctions are not made in the book, except by implication. Obviously they raise the whole question as to the exact sense in which we can say that acquaintance (through the senses or otherwise) is knowledge. And this in turn draws attention at once to the part played by language- to the questions and answers that do in fact occur in real intercourse, about " I see " and " I know ". I suspect that if one began in this way, the central problems of the book would soon take on a very different aspect. The test-problem for a theory of this kind, must be to explain the parts played by intuition and by inference, in our knowledge of the external world. For our direct intuitive knowledge of extended things must be of very modest dimensions. As I sit here, for instance, I know that some- thing is acting on my eyes to produce the mosaic of colours which makes the two-dimensional whole of my present visual-field; and I recollect something of the way in which I have been at various times in contact with objects in the room. But (as Father Hawkins writes): "I have a genuinely intuitive perception of the chair in which I am sitting "-which suggests that justice has not been done to the cognitive powers of that part of the anatomy which occupies the seats of chairs! Father Hawkins does not attempt to explain in detail how we come to make inferences by the use of sense-data. The relation of " pressure- data " to the data of the five senses is obscure. In particular, it is hard to</page><page sequence="8">364 NEW BOOKS. see how, on this theory, I can ever know that an external agent is concerned with this or that particular datum of one or other of the remote senses. Granted I may know, when I press my hand on the table, that the object is the cause of the feeling of constriction in my hand: how can I know that it also causes the shape and the colour that I now see ? The author speaks of using sense-data as signs or symbols: this suggests Whitehead's principle, " the intersection of the two modes of perception": but though Father Hawkins quotes from Symbolism with approval, he makes no attempt to introduce the more subtle notions of Whitehead's analysis. This account should make clear to the reader, whether or not this little book will bring grist to his mill. It should be mentioned that the argument moves briskly forward along a wide front and that the impression is given that every one of the problems in the field is somehow brought to a satis- factory conclusion. This, of course, cannot be: in fact, many of the dis- cussions are much too brief and superficial. Nevertheless, something well worth while is accomplished. Inside the trim boundaries of the familiar themes, the author inserts an acute discussion of two fundamental weaknesses of British Empiricism: first, it seems to oblige us to say that all our judgments about the external world are doubtful; second, it seems to oblige us to try to describe a world of individuals in terms that are all universal or general. At least Father Hawkins makes the reader see the importance and the difficulty of these two problems, and enables the reader to watch somebody trying very hard to do an important job. It is partly for this reason that the book could be recommended for use in an elementary class. There is another good reason for recommending its use in institutions of higher education (whether Catholic or otherwise). The discussion of the various topics, though not attempting to give their long history, makes excellent use of the history of philosophy and provides an intro- duction to important controversies of the past. The author has some talent for the broad history of ideas, and moves easily from the Greeks to the British Empiricists, and from Descartes back to Suarez and S. Thomas. His professional studies no doubt gave him a particular in- terest in the scholastics. While he makes it clear that it was Descartes who founded the criticism of experience as an independent and (would-be) rigorous branch of philosophy, he insists rightly, that the less deliberate and less systematic views of earlier philosophers also have great val-ue. His account of the Representationalist controversy, from Democritus to Hume, is one example of good broad exposition. Amongst the moderns, the author gives a special place to Reid and Hamilton. KARL BRITTON. A Preface to Logic. By MORRIS R. COHEN. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1944. Pp. xi + 209. $ 2.50. IN this collection of studies, the late Professor Cohen examines some of the border-line problems of logic and philosophy. He explains in his Foreword that the book is not intended to be another treatise on logic but an ex- ploration of such peripheral problems as 'the relation of logic to the rest of the universe, the philosophical pre-suppositions which give logic its meaning and the applications which give it importance' (p. xi). The work contains nine studies of such problems which include the subject matter</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 365 ,of logic, the nature of propositions and the relation between logic and language, probability, statistics and scientific method, and, finally, the contribution of logic to the study of values and the elucidation of general world order. An appendix contains reviews of F. H. Bradley's Principles of Logic and John Dewey's Essays in Experimental Logic written in 1927 and 1916 respectively, in which Professor Cohen gives his estimate of these logicians and their contributions to the subject. It is impossible for a reviewer to chase all the lively hares started by these discussions. Professor Cohen is stimulating on all the perennial logical puzzles, and those interested in them can be confidentlyrecommended to his pages. Throughout, however, he defends a realistic or ontologic view of logic. He is slightly contemptuous of certain recent doctrines of the meaningless or verbal character of logically necessary propositions. For, ' I cannot see ', he says, ' how logical and mathematical statements, if they are characterised as devoid of sense or meaning, can also be true or false' (p. 48). And that the propositions of logic are true is indisputable. He is not, perhaps, quite fair to the logical positivists who use' meaningless' in a special sense. To say that logical propositions are 'meaningless', in this sense, signifies only that they are analytic or tautologous and, particularly, that no empirical facts are relevant to their truth or falsity. And Professor Cohen himself would agree that logically necessary pro- positions are not verified or disproved by observable situations. Nor do Carnap and his followers deny that they are true in some sense. By interpreting them as tautologies, rules of grammar or conventions, they strive to determine the particular sense in which they are true. As Professor Cohen rightly points out, however, logic is not what is ordinarily meant by the 'grammar' of English, French, German or any other par- ticular language, but is common to6 all methods of general communication. Even if the positivists were right, therefore, the problem would still remain of determining the special language of which logic is the grammar. I find Profesor Cohen's own alternative solution, however, somewhat befogged by the blessed word possibility. The propositions of logic (with which Professor Cohen identifies mathematics) are necessarily true. What makes them so ? he asks. Not feelings of certainty, linguistic rules, or empirical facts. But facts of some sort. ' The existence of the logical or relational structure of Euclid's geometry is as much a fact as the com- position of albumen, the structure of rocks, or the construction of the solar system, all of which depend on geometric relations ' (p. 15). But the laws of the composition of physical bodies or systems state facts about the observable constituents of those complex objects. What are the objects connected by geometrical or logical relations ? Professor Cohen tries, as follows, to explain the difference. The empirical sciences assert laws the contraries of which are abstractly possible. Logical laws, however, are those whose contraries are devoid of meaning or application to any possible determinate objects (p. 16). They are, therefore, those which express ' the most generally or abstractly possible relations between all 1 objects' (p. 44) and this field of possibilities explored by logic represents 'the ways in which the elements of the actual world can be arranged and transformed' (p. 56). Later on, possibility is distinguished as abstract and concrete (p. 180). Concrete possibilities are expressed by those hypothetical propositions 1 My italics.</page><page sequence="10">366 NEW BOOKS. which state what will occur to an existing object under given empirical conditions. 'If this is butter, it will melt in the sun'. Bare or abstract possibility is the class of all possible objects and their transformations (p. 180). Hence, logic 'is an exploration of the field of possibility just as truly as astronomy is an exploration of the field of stellar motions ' (p. 181). So that, according to Professor Cohen, to say that the laws of logic are necessarily true is to say that they apply to all possible objects and not only to those which happen to exist, But this is, surely, fallacious ? It is true that 'if p is included in r and r is included in q then p is included in q', applies to any class of objects which does or might exist. To say that this proposition is logically necessary, however, is to say that the conclusion is entailed by the premisses and that its contradictory is self-contradictory. The application of the proposition to any suitably defined set of objects is an independent logical operation. It cannot, therefore, be the ground or reference of the logical necessity of the original inference. There is no magic in imaginary facts (and what more are possible facts or possibilities ?) which makes propositions about them necessarily true while those about actual facts are contingent. Moreover, the law of contradiction is logically necessary and, in one sense, its application is thereby impossible. For there could be no proposition which was at once both true and false. That logical propositions apply to possible objects cannot, therefore, give an explanation of their distinguishing characteristic of being necessarily true. Nor, in my opinion, is the search for such explanation a genuine investiga- tion. There is nothing more fundamental or better known by which logical necessity can be explained or interpreted. On probability, Professor Cohen defends, in general, the frequency theory, maintaining that most judgments of probability are either founded upon, or correlated with, statistical evidence. (p. 120). In a brief paragraph on p. 121, however, he does admit that other tests of reliability may be admitted into the establishment of scientific conclusions. He does not, however, enlarge on these and one is left wvith the impression that they are relatively unimportant. But this seems doubtful. The probability of a scientific theory, for example, is surely, not derived from the number of times that theories based on evidence obtained by similar methods have been established. In estimating the evidence for the probability of Freud's Theory of the Interpretation of Dreams, an investigator does not count the Electronic Theory of Matter, the Mendelian Theory of Inheritance, Keynes' Theory of Money and every other established scientific theory as evidence of its probability, but only the particular propositions which Freud himself adduces as evidence for his conclusions. Relative frequency is most clearly applied to the interpretation of the probability attaching to propositions about further occurrences of a class of relatively homo- geneous, repeatable events, such as the yearly number of suicides, the proportion of passes and failures in next year's matriculation examinations, etc. Only by an unwarranted stretching of the meaning of the word 'frequency' can it be applied to the partial confirmation of all empirical conclusions. But there is no point in thus misusing a perfectly good word instead of recognising different senses of 'probable' appropriate to the types of evidence accepted by qualified investigators for the establishment of conclusions in various branches of empirical knowledge. Nor can a theory of probability be adequate which makes nonsense of such a state- ment as 'I shall probably go to London to-morrow' except by reference to previous journeys entirely irrelevant to to-morrow's mission.</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 367 In a study of 'Values, Norms and Science', Professor Cohen ascribes to ethics the task of clarifying and systematizing the reasons for human preferences which, when formulated, are ' norms '. Nevertheless, ' norms ' are also good reasons for preferences and not merely any by which a pre- ference happens to be supported. Unfortunately, Professor Cohen is not very enlightening on the criteria of good reasons or 'norms'. He rejects the positivist or relativist view that since moral values vary in different societies you may 'pay your money and take your choice '. And he is right. Some choices are better than others. But not, he thinks, by refer- ence to any absolute standards of moral worth. He contents himself with the somewhat vague assertion that reasonable choices are possible if moral principles are treated as incomplete symbols to be completed by the par- ticular circumstances of their application. 'Lying is wrong' and the fact that Spartan boys and Hitler youth were taught to lie does not make it right, as the relativist view sometimes suggests. But neither is 'Thou shalt not lie' an absolute law to be observed in all circumstances. If a greater good would be achieved by lying it would be right to lie. But beyond reminding us to use our wits in moral conduct, this is not very helpful. The book is completed with an index. There are misprints on pages 68 and 97. M. MACDONALD. The Development of Mathematical Logic and of Logical Positivism in Poland Between the Two Wars. By Z. JORDAN. (Polish Science and Learning, No. 6, April 1945.) Oxford University Press. Pp. 7-39. Biblio- graphy and Annotations, pp. 40-47. This issue of Polish Science and Learning, as contrasted with those previously published, is devoted to a single essay. In it Dr. Jordan gives a survey of the contributions of Polish writers in mathematical logic and an account of logical positivism as developed in Poland. Written under most difficult conditions, while the author served in the Polish armed forces, it nevertheless contains an amount of detail surprising in light of the writer's lack of access to Polish books and articles referred to, and a most useful and extensive bibliography. The names of Lukasiewicz, Lesniewski, and Tarski, who led the Lwow- Warsaw School, and of Chwistek at Cracow, are familiar to English-speaking readers. Rather than summarise the monograph's ten sections, the reviewer will try to group around these figures and a few others the chief contributions. Principia Mathematica was the starting point for two main directions of work: I., attempts to use logic as a means to solving founda- tion problems of mathematics; II., stu4y of the construction and pro- perties of formalised deductive systems. I (a) Chwistek's discovery that on the basis of Russell's theory of types Richard's antinomy could be reinstated by use of the axiom of reducibility led him to his " theory of constructive types " which dispenses with this axiom. To meet the criticism that a great deal of mnathematics was thereby sacrificed, since his theory made it impossible to prove the existence of the continuum and thus curtailed the Cantorean theory of sets, he showed that analysis could be reconstructed on the basis of his system. Dr. Jordan's exposition of Chwistek's system is the least clear of the dis- cussions in the survey. He characterises it as motivated by opposition</page><page sequence="12">368 NEW BOOKS. -to " verbal " philosophy, which in the context suggests opposition to the assumption of non-constructible objects; but his account of Chwistek's -conception of semantics as " the set of rules and formuloe by means of -which expressions in logic and mathematics can be constructed mechani- cally " (26) leaves both this opposition and the conception of semantics -unclear. (b) The attempt to provide a foundation for mathematics in logic led Lesniewski to formulate a system consisting of " Protothetic" (the propositional calculus), " Ontology " (roughly, the theory of classes and relations), and " Mereology " (which is formally similar to the Boolean algebra except for the exclusion of the null class). The aim of the latter was to establish a theory of sets free from the paradoxes. In it " semantical categories " are to replace logical types. (c) Kuratowski reduced relation theory to class theory (cf. the Wiener-Kuratowski definition of ordered couples in terms of classes). And he used the logical notation in solving the mathematical problem of evaluating a projective class of a set of points and in proving theorems found by more complicated means. (d) On applying a logical procedure to defining a mathematical notion (e.g., " the definability of a set of real numbers ") Tarski was able to use " structural properties of the definition to draw inferences about the properties of the defined notion ". (20) II. Study of formalised deductive systems issued in (a) new develop- ments in connexion with propositional calculi and (b) metalogic. Among -the contributions falling under (a) Dr. Jordan mentions the discovery by Lukasiewicz (simultaneously with P. Bernays) that the Principia primi- tives are not independent, and his construction of a complete set of three primitives, using the CN symbolism which he devised to dispense with dots and brackets; several alternative reductions of the primitives for the propositional calculus to one primitive only (Lukasiewicz, Wajsberg, Lesniewski, Tarski); discovery of formuhe equivalent to the Nicod- Sheffer axiom, and simplification of it (Lukasiewicz, Tarski, Wajsberg, Sobocinski); introduction (1920) of truth-tables by Lukasiewicz1; formu- lation of the necessary and sufficient conditions which a function " f " with a propositional argument must satisfy in order to be a truth-function in Whitehead-Russell's sense (Tarski); Wajsberg's proof that the system of Strict Implication is not reducible to that of Material Implication; and finally, Lukasiewicz's discovery of many-valued systems of logic,2 ,which is judged by Dr. Jordan to eclipse everything done in the field of logical research in Poland. His three-valued system, which is motivated by the idea that statements about the future are neither true nor false, contains functions partially coinciding with modal functions. n-valued systems beyond n = 3 are interpreted with difficulty if at all. (b) It was natural that there should develop a wide study of general features of formalised deductive theories, and that the distinction between logic and metalogic, between expressions of a system and the language we use in speaking about these, should arise. Accordiug to Tarski it is im- perative that this distinction be observed since ordinary speech, which blurs it, gives rise to antinomies. The conviction that ordinary language, which provides the metalogical, or syntactical, terms of a system, is an 'The idea of truth-tables was developed at least as early as 1902 by Peirce.-Reviewer's Note. 2Lukasiewicz's three-valued system appeared in 1920, his n-valued system not until 1930.

Post's n-valued system appeared in 1921. -Reviewer's Note.</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 369 inadequate tool, resulted in careful scrutiny of such terms as " axiom ", "conclusion ", " rule of transformation ", " proof ", " primitive term ", "definition ". According to Lesniewski the use of definitions (which he contends are not mere convenient abbreviations) requires special formative rules, and the rules of transformation a series of " terminological explana- tions " (forty-nine such are given). Tarski showed that the terms " deduc- tive system ", " set of axioms ", " independence ", " completeness ", " consistency " could all be defined in terms of the notions of a meaningful statement and of the consequence relation. (E.g., a set of propositions is consistent if it is not equivalent to the class of meaningful statements.) These two notions were taken as primitive in Tarski's Calculus of Systems, in which the variables represent deductive systems. This calculus con- stitutes a partial interpretation of Boolean algebra. It is formally similar to Heyting's propositional calculus, inasmuch as only a weakened form of the law of excluded middle holds. (X = X is a theorem, but X = X is not.) Finally, metalogic itself was axiomatised by Tarski and in it the notion of proof made precise. The reviewer found this account of Tarski's metalogical system not as clear as could be desired. Following the sections on mathematical logic and a short section on work in the history of logic are three sections on logical positivism in Poland, the development and representatives of which are largely unfamiliar to English-speaking readers. One had hoped that the section on its distinctive features, which the author insists it has, would have marked it off more clearly from the work of the Viennese Circle. These features are set out as follows: " ordinary speech is an inadequate tool in philo- sophical research; so far as philosophy is concerned, language and not introspection and intuition is the main source of evidence; the proper subject matter of philosophy . . . is the fundamental notions and pro- positions as well as the methods of particular sciences . . . only verifiable propositions are scientifically valid ". (32) The outstanding figures of logical positivism in Poland are Kotarbinski and Ajdukiewicz. Although amongst Polish positivists " there is no pronounced tendency to form a system " (32), Kotarbinski did construct a system, called "Reism ", whose main theses are stated to be: the category of things (physical objects) is " the only ontological category " (34), names for these alone being proper subjects of subject-predicate sentences; there are no sensory qualities (cf. New Realism) ; psychological statements describe objects of the external world; psychological and physiological processes are identical. The affinity of this view with Physicalism is clear, although Kotarbinski did not go so far as to attempt an " Einheitswissen- schaft ", or " system comprehending all scientific statements formulated in a constructed homogeneous language ". (34) Opposition to logical positivism in Poland took much the same form as elsewhere. Ajdukiewicz's work consists mainly in the investigation of language (but not, according to Dr. Jordan, of any of the " natural " languages). The meaning of an expression in a language is, roughly speaking, defined in terms of rules for its usage. Ajdukiewicz's view is that any language consists not only of vocabulary and rules of syntax but also of rules of meaning (" rules establishing the correspondence between a word or an expression and a meaning. . . ." (35) ). Such rules are of three kinds: axiomatic rules (e.g., 1 + 1 = 2); deductive rules, requiring the accept- ance of conclusion from premises; empirical rules (to quote the unclear illustration given (35): " if John understands ' P ' and ' P '-' John 24</page><page sequence="14">370 NEW BOOKS. experiences so-and-so', then John cannot deny 'P' when he experiences so-and-so "). Various languages exist, i.e., various systems of meanings, which are equally valid. (Cf. Poincar6's conventionalism.) The monograph closes with a personal postscript giving the historical setting of adversity and disruption in which the work of the generations between the two wars was carried on. ALICE AMBROSE. The Rediscovery of Belief. By Louis Arnaud Reid, D. Litt. London: The Lindsey Press. Pp. 203. 6s. THiE aim of this book is to bring out the limitations of humanism and to show how a person of enlightenment should view religious questions. Beginning with a shrewd diagnosis of the main ills of our time, it proceeds to a number of important topics ranging from education and social questions to the authority of the scriptures (a timely plea is made for greater dis- semination of the established facts about the historicity of the gospels), the use of the creeds in worship (by entering imaginatively into the ex- periences they embody while " keeping our hardly-won freedom and integrity "-p. 178), the 'person of Jesus' and the doctrine of the Atone- ment. The discussion does not always carry conviction but it is informative, suggestive, and concise. Professor Reid has packed a great deal of philo- sophical wisdom into his book without making it difficult for the layman or tedious for the expert-even when discussing the well-worn theme of Hedonism. The book deserves to be widely read. It is the author's account of humanism that most invites comment here. It is contended that the humanist fails especially to deal mith moral evil. This is for two reasons, not always very clearly distinguished by the author. (a) Even if the humanist does not seek " to explain evil away, in terms of psychology or history or social environment or lack of education " (p. 66), he cannot in consistency acknowledge " the radical nature of moral evil " (p. 67), for he is bound to be " measuring evil by a human standard which he himself has provided " (p. 69). Standards which " transcend man and are given to him and not made by him " must have " an implicitly religious basis " (p. 68). But there the reviewer must confess to much difficulty. Is there not a third view which Professor Reid does not discuss ? May we not avoid relativism (" the shallowest of doctrines " p. 44) in terms of objective ethical standards intuitively discerned and not derived at all from the nature of man himself, without raising any distinctively religious questions ? The case for moral objectivity has in fact, been most per- suasively presented without recourse to religious matters, and Professor Reid himself fully admits that " genuine morality exists quite independently of any religious beliefs " (p. 99), that there is " a genuine intrinsically authoritative morality " (p. 91). But he holds that the moral standard, none-the-less " depends upon what (one sort of) religion affirms " (p. 92), " human good would not command were it not for God, because it would not exist " (p. 103). But is this dependence peculiar to ethics ? Is more affirmed than that, for a religious view, everything stands in some dependence upon God ? If not, we can answer the relativist without recourse to religion. But the suggestion seems to be that we cannot. If so, we need to be told very carefully why-as we are not told by the author. His procedure seems to be to present the case for religion in general, it being assumed that this carries with it his own view of the</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 371 dependence of ethics on religion. But it may well be argued that we need to answer the relativist as a step in the process of building up a religious view: that, among other regrettable consequences, too direct an absorption of ethics in religion is very harmful to the cause of religion (it Would still be true that religious views would amplify the content of our moral ideals in important ways). (b) Man cannot of himself conform to transcendent standards-he needs the help of God. This again is very perplexing, and not less so because very familiar in religious thought. To say that the standard " is not concocted or set up by man himself " (p. 64) is one thing, to set it beyond his reach is another. Transcendence in the first of these senses could be ensured by ordinary objectivist ethics; how is the second obtained, and how can an ideal be an ideal for us and a measure of our evil if man cannot fulfil it ' by his unaided effort' ? Professor Reid follows the orthodox doctrine in denying that " evil is eliminable by man" (p. 67), but he does so with some hesitation, for he declares also, that "there is no absolute inevitability about sin " (p. 174) although sin " is almost infinitely likely to happen " (a hard statement) and that, on the other hand, Jesus was sinless but not bound to be so-our estimate of him being " em- pirical " (pp. 172-174). But in the main, he seems assured that there is " a corrupting element in all men's actions ", that " all love of man for man is ultimately the gift of God " (p. 102), that the unaided effort of man to be rid of his sin " in itself implies separation from God, a form of egoism, and therefore sin " (p. 157). He also describes sin as " subjective blindness " (p. 96) to be cured by a new vision of God, but the blindness betokens moral evil and guilt, man is wicked because of it. For " the will is free " and " the choice is finally man's " although " the victory . . . is of God " (p. 123). But this appears hardly consistent. Nor will it help to ascribe 'the sin of unbelief ' to the fact that " man will not see the truth " (p. 122), for this ambiguous statement is acceptable, if at all, only in a highly elliptical sense. We can only will to do (or not do) what will make us see. It does not seem, therefore, that Professor Reid has suc- ceeded in making the traditional doctrine more coherent, and we simply cannot make a virtue of sheer contradiction by calling it a paradox. It seems plain that sin, moral evil, and guilt, can only refer to what is avoid- able by the individual. If the 'sense of sin' has significance beyond this, and it may well refer to something important in religious experience, it cannot be to sin that it really points. Is anything to be gained by con- tinuing to deny this in the face of elementary ethical principles ? Is not the idea of original sin irretrievably barbarous, and would it not be the better part of valour to seek a new conception of the relation of ethics to religion ? The problem at least cries out for discussion, especially in view of the present state of theology, and it would have been helpful if Professor Reid had attacked it more boldly. This bears on two other main contentions of Professor Reid-firstly, the view that the wicked put themselves " outside the pale of ordinary human consideration " (p. 81) because the ' charity of humanism' is limited to ' selfless affection ' based on ' lovable qualities ' of character, and, secondly, the advocacy of the ' double standard ' and the ' special vocation ' of a few to live by an ' impossible ' ' perfectionist ' ethic which is also an ideal for the majority in so far as it is directed " not to actions at all, but to the very disposition of the soul itself " (p. 140). (It is held, not, I think, on very solid grounds, that Jesus himself did not expect his injunctions to be generally followed but was " as far as this world is concerned a real</page><page sequence="16">372 NEW BOOKS. defeatist in his teaching "-p. 140). The position as a whole would be improved if it were presented frankly as a Socratic ethic (much derided as advanced by the humanists-cf. p. 58) without infusion into it of in- compatible ideas of guilt and responsibility. Its difficulties point to a completer revision of accepted religious doctrines than the author is pre- pared to undertake. H. D. LEWIS. Berkeley's Immaterialism. By A. A. LUCE, M.C., D.D., Litt.D. London: Thos. Nelson &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1945. Pp. xii + 163. 6s. THIS is a captivating book. Written in a manner which recalls the fresh and racy idiom of the Principles, and presenting its case with something of the same disarming directness, terseness and naivete, it bids fair to become a popular text-book with those who desire a more sympathetic and less disparaging treatment of Berkeley than is usually accorded to him. It is by its charm, however, rather than by the weight or cogency of its arguments, that it must hope to make converts to the immaterialist faith. The book is divided into twelve short chapters, with an Introduction, in the form of a brief biography, and an Appendix, in which the discussion of immaterialism is brought up-to-date. In chapters III to VI the first seven sections of the Principles, which " contain the essence of Berkeley's case ", are expounded seriatim with considerable clarity and felicity of expression but with little critical appreciation of the difficulties involved. Berkeley's famous doctrine of the Divine Cause is discussed in chapter IX and his replies to Thirteen Objections in chapter XI. I have, regrettably, no space, in a short review, i-n which to summarize the contents of these chapters. I can only indicate briefly my main reason for feeling dis- satisfied with the book as a whole. It seems to me, that Dr. Luce sets out to do what simply cannot be done, which is to convince the critical reader that " Berkeley's immaterialism is sound common-sense " (p. vi). He builds his case on the claim that the denial of matter in Berkeley does not imply a theory of 'private worlds '. "Objectivity is the key-note of the Principles. He [Berkeley] is no solip- sist, nor subjectivist, nor subjective idealist " (p. 46). Notwithstanding his insistence on the intra-mentality of objects, he keeps " what is in the mind ' intirely distinct' from the mind itself " (p. 51), and "is always loyal to the subject-object relation" (p. 28). He even " affirms external things in the ordinary sense of . . . things other than ourselves, things of external origin ". (p. 136). The crux comes, however, when the question arises as to the objectivity of what lies outside the range of actual per- ception at any moment. Dr. Luce is at pains to show that Berkeley " has room for the perceivable as well as the perceived " (p. 46). He explains that, so far as human perception is concerned, his formula for the existence of the perceivable is " conditional perception by myself or actual per- ception by someone else " (p. 64). But this formula, Dr. Luce has no difficulty in showing, is not ultimately self-explanatory. It pre-supposes the ' divine factor ' in the human perceptual situation. " God is the home of the perceivable when it is unperceived by man ". (p. 75). Now Dr. Broad takes Berkeley's teaching here to mean that God produces ideas 'telepathically' in our minds and is not so much, therefore, the 'home of the perceivable' as the permanent source of possible future perceptions. (Proc. Brit. Ac., 1942, p. 122). Dr. Luce, on the other hand, fastens on</page><page sequence="17">NEW BOOKS. 373 Berkeley's doctrine of God as a guarantee of the objectivity of the perceiv- able in a sense which makes Berkeley a realist without jeopardy to his immaterialism. 'Seeing all things in God' implies the existence of an order of appearances which, though subject to the New Principle (esse est percipi) and, therefore, wholly intra-mental, are nevertheless always there in the mind of God waiting to be perceived by this or that finite mind. Dr. Luce makes it plain that this is how he understands the doctrine of the divine participation. God not only 'produces' ideas, but 'offers' them to us. The world consists of " ideas perceived and ideas waiting to be perceived " (p. 45 ital. mine). For God's " action is action in depth, and we must not think of it as a passing, superficial impression on the milnd " (p. 105). His " continuous creative action makes and sustains a vast system of significant things and exhibits them to Us " (Ibid. italics mine). And, as intra-mental entities, these objects are 'sustained' by the fact that God perceives them. " When neither you, nor 1, nor any other created spirit, perceives the object, it is still there, still luminous, stilt significant, still perceived, still in the mind of God" (p. 124). There is; accordingly, in Berkeley no 'intermittency' and no shutting up of per- cipients within their own private worlds. " You can perceive my ideas of sense, and I yours; for neither of us makes what we both see" (ibid.). You may see what I see and I see what you see because we are both seeing what God sees. Berkeley's intra-mental world is at the same time "a public world, a world in which we all may share " (p. 136). How is Dr. Luce able to justify this paradox ? By skilfully arguing as if the implication of the New Principle were that ' to be 'is to be generally 'significant ' or, in other words, that the dependence of sensible existence is upon perception in general. Time and again, while recognizing that mind for Berkeley means a mind, Dr. Luce himself uses the term in a sense which obscures the numerical distinction between the Infinite Mind and finite minds and between one finite mind and another. Thus in both my world and God's " the object is not absolute but relative to mind " (p. 71, italics mine) and there is " no great difference in principle between seeing all things in God and seeing all things in the mind " (p. 74). Again, it is because there is such a thing as " a spiritual Substance of the universe Lthat] . . . the object of sense can be handed on from man to man " (p. 124). Now the question I should like to ask, is whether this interpretation of the New Principle is consistent with Berkeley's attack on abstract general ideas. Can Berkeley, of all people, admit the existence of 'mentality' or consciousness or perception in general or, therefore, equate ' being ' with the fact of being perceived in general ? On Dr. Luce's own showing, he is not a pantheist. God,'s mind, though infinite, is no less individual than men's minds. But if only individual percipients exist and all per- ceiving is particular, esse est percipi must imply that the ' being' of whatever a given percipient at any moment perceives is 'to be perceived ' in that particular perceiving and, therefore, only by that particular percipient. The New Principle, in other words, is inescapably subjectivist. Does not Berkeley himslf say: " the table . . . exists, that is, I see and feel it " ? (Princ. III, italics mine). It follows, therefore, that since ideas exist in the mind of God only in so far as they are perceived by God, those ideas are internal to God's mind in a sense which must surely preclude the possibility of their constituting at the same time an order of intra-mental existence which is always there 'waiting to be perceived' by the other denizens of the world of 'mind'.</page><page sequence="18">374 NEW BOOKS. It seems to me that the only role God can have on Berkeley's pre- suppositions is that of generating pr ivate 'ideas' telepathically, and, therefore, necessarily intermittently, in the minds of finite percipients. The private worlds thus generated will be independent of our volitions and, therefore, objective in point of origin, but not objective in point of sensible content. All sensible content is subject to the New Principle. It can exist only in the particular mind which perceives it. What Berkeley's immaterialism must imply, in other words, is not that 'things' are in some sense always there, waiting to be perceived by us, but that God is always there waiting to 'excite' in us ideas which, before this happens are just nowhere. But is this common-sense ? J. R. JONES. The Case for Pacifism and Conscientious Objection. By Rev. E. L. ALLEN, M.A., PHD.; F. E. POLLARD, M.A., J.P.; and G. A. SUTHERLAND, M.A. London, Central Board for Conscientious Objectors, 1946. Pp. 24, 24, 24. 3s. 6d. THIs work is published as a reply to Prof. Field's recent booklet on Pacifism and Conscientious Objection, where the author had examined the arguments brought before him in the course of his experience as member of a tribunal (reviewed by me in the Januiary number of MIND). Those who were shocked by the low standard of the objectors' arguments there will find the present statement to rise far above such a level; but in justice to Prof. Field we must remember that he was giving an account of what was actually said by the ordinary applicants, not by a select few of a considerably higher intellectual calibre such as have written this book, It may be contended that the pacifist case should be judged by its best, not by its worst, advocates; but at least, since the crude fallacies men- tioned by Field have obviously exercised an influence, it is well that they should be exposed, and it seems to me that the writers of the articles now under discussion go too far in whitewashing the intelligence of conscientious objectors against such damaging imputations, though I (and, no doubt, Field) would agree with the point made in reply that a person may be a quite genuine objector even if he uses only silly arguments and that these may not represent the real basis of his conviction. Turning to the actual statements of their case by the three writers whose articles make up the pamphlet under discussion, they certainly command respect, and in my case a considerable degree of sympathy and, I think, understanding, though it does not seem to me that they altogether face the most vital issues raised by Field or altogether escape the fallacies which he has pointed out. In the case for the objector as stated here we can distinguish three main contentions. (1) In war all the ordinary moral principles which every decent man respects in peace are reversed in our conduct towards the enemy, thus putting war in a quite different position from any other line of action commonly sanctioned. (2) Whatever view one may hold as to the person of Christ, it is difficult to resist the conviction that the way of love and sacrifice which he expounded and exemplified is essentially a better way of dealing with wrong than that of force. (3) It is felt that, if war is ever to be abolished at all, some individuals must start by setting the example of repudiating it in toto, while the majority still accept it as a legitimate means of settling certain disputes.</page><page sequence="19">NEW BOOKS. 375 No one who realises the gravity of the first charge will lightly reject pacifism, but in the case of the late war is it not also true that the domin- ance of the world by Hitler would have in practice resulted in a general repudiation and corruption of moral principles even greater, not for six years but for an indefinitely long period ? This raises the question of the legitimacy of making exceptions to a good general moral principle for the sake of consequences. The first writer at least admits the possibility of exceptions, but, if exceptions are admitted at all, it is difficult to imagine a stronger case for an exception than the late war. He, however, makes a good point when he draws a distinction between a man who acts on the assumption that a given good moral principle is universal till he feels absolutely forced, much against the grain, to make an exception, and the man who always has an eye on possible exceptions and prepares system- atically in advance to make them efficiently if the need arises. " I know of no moral philosopher who would argue that, because, in his opinion, it is sometimes not merely permissible but a duty to lie, therefore all men of eighteen and upwards must be trained in the art of lying so as to ensure that, should need arise, they will be able to do it efficiently and un- blushingly." 1 But suppose the training of a nation for war were in the circumstances just what was needed to prevent war ? Field would not himself claim that we could prove pacifism to be wrong, and unless we claim to know a priori that it is never justifiable to wage war, it must be a question of balancing the evil effects of not fighting in the particular case against the evils of war. As long as we are talking of national armies and not either of an international force representing an organisation like the United Nations or of ordinary police measures, the pacifist argument is, I think, extremely strong except in the most unusual cases, but I think that the case of 1939 was one of these unusual ones. No doubt most of what is said about the need and advantage of systematically pursuing a policy which really aims at peace and fair dealing long before war breaks out could be accepted by non-pacifists. As regards the second point, the example of Christ, even if we grant that, if we were all like Christ, we should have found a better way of dealing with Hitler than war, it does not follow that, being what we are, in the situation of 1939, we could have stopped him without fighting or that we ought not to have fought. As regards the third point, I person- ally, though not a pacifist myself, feel very glad that there were some pacifists to give their uncompromising witness against war, but think it quite wrong to talk as if the example set by the total repudiation of it by some individuals could be the chief factor in stopping wars once for all. Nothing but a miracle could make any of the Great Powers pacifist as a whole, in time to end wars before they destroyed civilisation; but there is a rational hope that, without being completely pacifist, in the sense of making up their minds not to fight whatever happened, they might be sensible enough not to let their future disputes lead to war, just as most individuals avoid committing homicide, though few would be pre- pared to say that they would not fight another in self-defence if they were attacked and it was a question of " his life or mine." None of the articles really face Field's point that, even if it were wrong for a state ever to fight, it might still be right for individual pacifists to join in the war once it had begun, since refusal to do so would not stop the war and might prevent the better cause winning or prolong the slaughter. ip. 13.</page><page sequence="20">376 NEW BOOKS. I have not left myself space to deal with the main topic discussed in the third article, i.e. the question of the defensibility of the position of those who sought unconditional exemption. I can only say that, while the author of the article has made such a position appear somewhat less unplausible than it does to Field, he still appears to me to have fallen into the fallacy of arguing as if the fact that a course of action was legally compulsory implied that anybody who acted in this way was so acting because it was legally compulsory (p. 9).
