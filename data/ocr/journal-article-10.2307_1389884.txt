<plain_text><page sequence="1">REGINALD RAY Response: Death of the Buddha REGINALD RAY Naropa Institute In his paper, Don Mitchell summarizes some theological perspectives underpin- ning the Christian Church's being and activity in the world, particularly as he understands these in the light of Vatican II and of the Focolare movement. Mit- chell sets the general context of his remarks by contrasting the death of Jesus with that of the Buddha, remarking on the very different ways in which these two figures died. Mitchell tells us, "The Buddha's life has a sense of comple- tion about it while that ofJesus does not. The Buddha taught the Dharma and established a large Sangha for nearly fifty years after his enlightenment before peacefully entering Parinirvana. On the other hand, Jesus lived only a few years of public life, a life that was ended by crucifixion. While the life of the Buddha has a sense of wholeness about it, the life ofJesus seems fragmentary, somehow incomplete" (p. 151 above). Mitchell elaborates on this comparison: The Buddha, as the Tathagata, has 'thus come' into the world, did 'what had to be done,' and has 'thus gone.' He renounced the world, sought and attained the most perfect enlightenment, offered to all people the Three Refuges, established a large and extremely vital community, and after this full life passed peacefully into complete Nirvana. Jesus, on the other hand, seems to have been violently torn out of this life, humiliated and crucified in the middle of his mission. He even seems to have been abandoned in the end by God and was certainly abandoned by his rather small and unimpressive group of followers. (P. 151 above) Mitchell then moves to his key point: he suggests that each of these deaths has a close connection with the ways in which Christianity and Buddhism are respectively "in the world." In reference to Christianity, he says, "I think that this sense of incompleteness about the life of Jesus is important to understand- ing the Christian mode of being-in-the-world" (p. 151 above). The theme of the integral connection between the manner of Jesus' death and the Christian way of being-in-the-world is central to Mitchell's paper and in fact is, he tells us, the thesis that he wants to explore in his paper. Reflecting on Mitchell's pro- vocative hypothesis, it seemed clear that he was also at least implying that the same thing was true of Buddhism: that the sense in the death of the Buddha of completeness, tranquillity, and peace is somehow important to understanding the Buddhist way of being-in-the-world. However, in the course of his paper, Mitchell does not apply his insight explicitly to Buddhism. I was puzzled by this and called Don, asking him whether he would in fact hold that the mode and manner of the Buddha's death is also indicative of the way in which Bud- dhism and Buddhists are in the world.' He said that he did feel that way. I 168</page><page sequence="2">RESPONSE TO MITCHELL asked him why he did not say this. He replied that he did not want to offend the Buddhists. He continued that the image of the Buddha living tranquilly, and dying tranquilly having completed his task, might indeed suggest to some just the kind of unconcern for the world's ills and impassivity in the face of suf- fering for which Buddhism is not infrequently criticized in the West. In his discussion of the deaths of Jesus and the Buddha, Mitchell raises three important and interrelated issues: the image of the death of the founder; the theological implications of that image for the way in which the subsequent reli- gion is in the world; and the particular character of the actual historical pres- ence of that religion in history. In this response, I wish to deal particularly with the first two of these three issues in Buddhism, the image of the Buddha and its theological implications for the presence of Buddhism in the world. The third issue of Buddhism's actual historical presence is a very large topic and one to which I can refer only briefly here. Specifically, I will agree with Mitchell that the image of the death of the Buddha has implications for the tradition's theo- logical stance vis-a-vis the world and that this, in turn, has an impact on Bud- dhism's actual historical presence. However, I will suggest that the matter is more complex than Mitchell's characterization indicates. For one thing, while the image of the death of the Buddha put forward by Mitchell is certainly the one best known in the West, it is complemented by some other, quite different images of the Buddha's passing. In addition, the implications of these other images for Buddhism's way of being-in-the-world, both theoretical and actual, are demonstrably different from those brought forward by Mitchell. The Death of the Buddha: Peace and Completion The image. -Mitchell says, again, "The Buddha's life has a sense of comple- tion about it," "a sense of wholeness about it." "The Buddha taught the Dharma and established a large Sangha for nearly fifty years after his enlighten- ment before peacefully entering Parinirvana." In this reading, the Buddha's teachings have been fully transmitted, and his work has been done. Mitchell's understanding of the Buddha's death ultimately derives from the well-known account of this event in the early tradition in the Mahaparinirvdna Sutra, an account of the final days and passing of the Buddha, which survives in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan versions. In this text, the Buddha is depicted as having come peacefully and naturally to the end of his life. In the Pali recen- sion, he tells Ananda, his beloved attendant, "I am now grown old and full of years and my journey is drawing to its close. I have reached my sum of days." In this account, the Buddha says that, after his death, he will no longer be with his disciples. His death is to be real, and it is to be final. He then wants to guide them toward peace of mind about this fact. "How could it be otherwise," he asks, "since all conditioned things, which have by their nature come into being, must likewise pass away."2 In effect, his death and disappearance from the scene will be his final teaching. 169</page><page sequence="3">REGINALD RAY The Buddha further indicates that the samgha need have no regrets about his passing since he has given them everything that they will need to continue on without him. In particular, he has given them the dharma, the teachings, and the vinaya, the various rules, structures, and conventions that order their monastic life. This is no inconsequential gift for, as the Mahaparinirvzna Sztra sees it, in a very real sense, the dharma and vinaya embody the Buddha's very essence. This is seen in the curious redefinition that the text gives to the term satthar (in Pali, or sastr in Sanskrit), "teacher." Formerly, the Buddha had been known as satthar, and it is the loss of their satthar that might cause grief. How- ever, the Buddha tells the assembled gathering that, although he is about to die, the satthar will still be with them for now the role of satthar will be taken over by the dharma and vinaya that he has left behind: "The Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda, and said, 'It may be, Ananda, that in some of you the thought may arise, "The word of the Master is ended, we have no teacher [satthar] more!" But it is not thus, Ananda, that you should regard it. The truths [dhamma] and the rules of the order [vinaya] which I have set forth and laid down for you all, let them, after I am gone, be the Teacher [satthar] to you."3 The sense of completion in the Buddha's death is clearly seen in another pas- sage in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra where the Buddha agrees that his bhiksu (monks) and his lay followers have become true disciples (savaka), "wise and well-trained, ready and learned, versed in the Scriptures, fulfilling all the greater and the lesser duties, correct in life, walking according to the precepts." Moreover, these have "learned the doctrine, [are] able to tell others of it, preach it, make it known, establish it, open it, minutely explain it and make it clear. . . . When others start vain doctrine, [they] shall be able by the truth to vanquish and refute it."4 The sense of fullness and of completion of the Bud- dha's life, and of the timeliness of his death, is very strong in the Mahaparinir- vana Satra. In this account, we find the Buddha in his death aloof and distant from the world: he does not share the death agony of common humanity; unlike the rest of us, he is not prematurely torn away (is not every other human death to some extent premature?); and, unlike all other humans, he does not die with work uncompleted. Jesus, on the other hand, fully shares our human- ity in all these ways. So far, Mitchell's contrast is apt and his point well taken. Presence in the world. -Mitchell is also right in connecting this image of the death of the Buddha with certain Buddhist attitudes toward worldly involve- ment. In order to get at these implications, it is necessary to consider again the locus classicus of the image of the Buddha summarized by Mitchell, the Maha- parinirvana Sztra. As Bareau, Frauwallner, and others have pointed out,5 like other accounts of the Buddha in what is conventionally known as "the early canon," this text in its several recensions is not an objective description of the master's life and death but rather the production of a certain group of people who want to project a certain theological message. In a penetrating analysis of 170</page><page sequence="4">RESPONSE TO MITCHELL early Buddhist literature, Frauwallner has convincingly argued that the Mahd- parinirvana Sutra originally formed part of a longer document, the Old Skan- dhaka in Frauwallner's terminology, that was a history of the establishment of Buddhism that included the life of the Buddha, the foundation of settled monasticism, and other events following the Buddha's death. As Frauwallner sees it-if I may epitomize a long and complex argument-the Old Skandhaka was produced by the early monastic church in order to articulate and establish the legitimacy of settled monasticism as the locus, par excellence, of normative Buddhism. The view articulated in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra is essentially a conserva- tive one. By "conservative," I mean the view that the past provides an essen- tially adequate set of beliefs, guidelines, practices, and institutions for the reli- gious life. In Buddhism, conservatism tends to reflect the belief in and primary sensitivity to the sacredness of the past as the primary locus of the Buddha's actions. The Mahdparinirvzna Sutra wants to say that established Buddhism, as understood by the text, provides what is needed for ongoing Buddhist tradi- tion. This view is reflected in the primary portrait of the Buddha in the Mahd parinirvana Sutra as one who, even in death, is satisfied and peaceful, having established everything that needs to be established, indefinitely into the future, for the correct Buddhist life.6 The Buddha has done what needs to be done, not only personally, but institutionally. In subsequent Buddhist history, the monastic church has in fact functioned within the larger Buddhist world as a relatively conservative force, stabilizing and preserving the tradition. For example, it has been established monasticism that has preserved Buddhist textual tradition, first in an oral and later in a writ- ten form, through study, reflection, discussion, and teaching. This function has also meant that it is the arbiter and guardian of "right doctrine" in Buddhism. In addition, through its reliance on the classical vinaya, monastic Buddhism has maintained its own institutional integrity and continuity and, thereby, also the institutional continuity of the tradition, which has provided an ongoing focus for the laity and a training ground for those wishing to renounce the world. The interest in institutional survival has meant that monasteries and their inhabi- tants have traditionally found it important to develop close ties to the forces of wealth and power in their regions. Understandably, in Buddhism as in other religions, this tendency has sometimes led to an acceptance and affirmation of the status quo. The Death of the Buddha: Agony andIncompletion Every religion, Buddhism included, possesses conservative trends, institution- ally and theologically. However, to identify Buddhism with an essentially con- servative demeanor makes as little sense as allowing the more conservative Christian forces to define our understanding of Christianity as a whole. In fact, like Christianity, Buddhism also possesses more liberal trends. By "liberal" in 171</page><page sequence="5">REGINALD RAY this context, I mean a looser identification with the forms of received tradition and a greater willingness to modify them in response to perceived exigencies of the present. In Buddhism, liberal trends tend to reflect a greater awareness of the sacredness of the present and the future as loci of the Buddha's action. The awareness of the present involves a particular sensitivity to its imperfect aspects and to its needs. Awareness of the future implies recognition of the essential openness of time (the future is bound by the past only as much as we want it to be) and its ability to accommodate new religious possibilities. This particular responsiveness to the needs of the present and to the possibilities of the future is given a specific theological designation in Buddhism, karuna, or "compas- sion." It is indicative of the theology of the more conservative trends in early Buddhism, such as those reflected in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, that compas- sion is not particularly set out as a central value. For the more liberal trends in Buddhism, such as those reflected in certain Mahayana strains, on the other hand, compassion stands much more at the center of the religious life. These more liberal trends are reflected in a series of images of the death of the Bud- dha that stand in some contrast with those in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra. The Buddha's vow. -In ancient India, there were many meditators like the Buddha, and some of these were understood to have attained the utmost height of realization and were given the epithet "buddha." Realization led many of these saints to withdraw permanently from the world into the solitude and silence of the forest.7 What seems to have set Sakyamuni Buddha apart was that his realization led him to return to the world in order to save others. In his biography, we are told that, sitting beneath the tree of his enlightenment for some days after his realization, great compassion for suffering humanity arose in him, leading him to undertake his forty-five-year teaching career. This was, so we are told, in fulfillment of his vow, articulated lifetimes before and repeat- edly reaffirmed in his final life, to achieve realization for the sake of the world. Further, in fulfillment of this vow, on his journey to buddhahood Sakyamuni underwent countless rebirths, during which he worked selflessly for the weal of others. The Buddha's death, then, must be seen in the light of his motivation of great compassion and his vow to liberate sentient beings. This vow is, of course, particularly emphasized in Mahayana Buddhism, and all Mahayanists are called on to take the same vow and emulate the Buddha's compassion. The sacrzficial lamb.-As Buddhism understands it, Sakyamuni's death (and more about this presently) is only one of countless deaths in his experience.8 Sakyamuni's personal story, his "biography" in the Buddhist sense, includes, not only the story of the final life in which be became Buddha, but also all the countless lifetimes preceding this final one, during which he was in prepara- tion. When we speak of the Buddha's death, we cannot speak only of this life; we must also include his experiences of death in these other lives, deaths that he is held to have vividly remembered as part of his enlightenment and that are described in texts called the Jatakas (stories of previous lives). These other 172</page><page sequence="6">RESPONSE TO MITCHELL deaths are often agonized and self-sacrificing.9 When we add these countless former deaths to the death described in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra and include them in Sakyamuni's biography, we have a much greater sense of the Buddha's full participation in the suffering and the anguish of the human condition. In the final moment of the millions of years of his spiritual journey, he experi- enced peace and fruition, but, through all the other moments, he lived our experience. Indeed, the Jdtakas clearly tell us, Sakyamuni could become the Buddha only because he had experienced every corner, every shadow, and every agony of our afflicted human condition. The Buddha and his teaching under attack.-It is often assumed, on the basis of the well-known image from the Mahaparinirvana Sztra epitomized by Don Mitchell, that the Buddha had a long, peaceful, and successful ministry. However, there is another series of images that convey a different picture. These reveal that the Buddha was also a besieged individual, sometimes rejected, sometimes hated by others. For example, a central figure throughout the hagio- graphic tradition of Sakyamuni Buddha is his jealous cousin Devadatta. This individual dogs the Buddha through most of his days, attempting to call into question the Buddha's integrity and wisdom, undermine his disciples, bring his teaching to ruin, and even bring him bodily harm and death.10 In the vari- ous images of the ruthless and relentless Devadatta, we find Buddhism ac- knowledging the constant and sometimes vicious pressures against the Buddha and his samgha in its early days. At least taking Devadatta as a reference point, the Buddha does not come off quite so nearly as the regal spiritual master whose power and ascendency are unchallenged and complete. A similar point is made in the stories that circulate around the demon Mara, the malevolent embodiment of evil who, parallel to Devadatta but in more hidden and insidious ways, seeks to destroy the Buddha, his disciples, and the dharma. The story of Mara's attack on Buddha prior to the enlightenment is well known, but equally important to the Buddha's hagiography are the stories of the threats posed by Mara after the Buddha's realization, particularly to his disciples and his teaching. Mara even outlives the Buddha for, after the Master dies, the demon continues his depredations, and it is only with the sixth patri- arch of Northern Buddhism, Upagupta, that we find Mara being decisively and, so it seems, finally converted. " On another front, the apparent confidence of the Mahaparinirvana Sutra regarding the full establishment of Buddhism by the time of the Buddha's passing is countered by other images that show the Buddha well aware that, after his death, the dharma will continue in mortal danger. In fact, in his hagiography, the Buddha predicts that evil will gradually overtake the teach- ings and the community and that they will finally disappear from the world. 12 The teaching of the disappearance of the dharma counterbalances the image of a solid and well-established tradition in the Mahaparinirvana Satra and, at the least, suggests that the Buddha's death occurs in a situation of incompletion 173</page><page sequence="7">REGINALD RAY and ambiguity, with the survival and flourishing of the dharma in serious ques- tion. Indeed, the widespread cult of Maitreya, the future Buddha who will one day come to set all wrongs right and turn this imperfect world into a pure land, makes sense only in the light of Buddhism's struggle for survival in the world. While the image of the Buddha in the Mahdparinirvana Sutra is aligned with the relatively conservative force of settled monasticism, the images just summa- rized reflect a diversity of contexts. The Mahayana trends placing particular emphasis on the Buddha's vow and compassion originated in predominantly nonmonastic contexts. The Jataka images of the Buddha's self-sacrificing lives and deaths seem particularly aligned with lay contexts. And, at least in some traditions, millenarian interest in Maitreya reflects the context of forest saints.13 Significantly, these images also reflect a more liberal theological attitude for they implicitly acknowledge, if in different ways, that received tradition is insufficient for the present. The world is in a sorry state, and received forms are not necessarily adequate to mend it. This means that we Buddhists must respond intelligently to the present in order to transform received tradition where needed. Ambiguities in the Buddha's death. -The Buddha is held to have lived to be eighty, but, interestingly enough, his death is nonetheless accounted prema- ture. In the Mahaparinirva.na Sutra, shortly before the Buddha dies, he says, if I may paraphrase, "You know, Ananda, not everyone has to die like an ordinary mortal. In fact, those who have attained the highest spiritual realization are not bound by death but can live as long as they wish. A Buddha is such a person." The only catch is that someone must ask a Buddha to do so, and this Ananda, although on this occasion sorely prompted by the Buddha, fails utterly to do. Why did Ananda fail to request the Blessed One to live longer? Because his heart was taken over by Mara, the Evil One. Ananda leaves the scene, and Mara facilitates the Buddha's passing.'4 When the Buddha dies, gods, laypeople, and monastics respond with untold grief:15 "They were grieved, and sad, and afflicted at heart. And some of them wept, dishevelling their hair, and some stretched forth their arms and wept, and some fell prostrate on the ground, and some reeled to and fro in anguish at the thought: 'Too soon has the Blessed One died! Too soon has the Happy One passed away! Too soon has the Light gone out in the world!' "16 In this portion of the Mahaparinirvazna Sutra, we find several themes with which we are familiar from the accounts of the death of Christ: the Buddha dies in an untimely fashion; his death is the result of evil, here Mara's possession of Ananda's heart; the Buddha's disciples, here personified by Ananda, do not give a very good account of themselves; and they subsequently feel intense anguish. Thus, even in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra itself, the Buddha's death does not stand free from confusion, human failing, cause for regret, and anguish. Although the Mahaparinirvdna Sutra tries to explain these themes away,17 it does not completely succeed in doing so and acknowledges the sense of a deeply flawed world, the Buddha's own participation in human limitation 174</page><page sequence="8">RESPONSE TO MITCHELL (he cannot live unless Ananda asks him to do so), and the incomplete nature of his work. The Buddha in the world. -In his paper, Mitchell mentions another element ofJesus' death that is central to the Christian understanding: Jesus died, but he rose from the dead, and his living presence continued in a concrete and tangi- ble way among his followers-in the empty tomb; in the stranger met by the apostles on the road to Damascus, whom they later recognize as Jesus; in the descent of the Holy Spirit on the apostles at Pentacost and his presence among them thereafter; in the indwelling of Christ in the believer, as when Saint Paul says, "Not I, but Christ within me," of the presence of Christ in the liturgy of Eucharist and in the Church. This presence, Mitchell implies, lies behind the dynamic presence of Christianity in the world. Indeed, without Jesus' resurrection and ongoing presence, one cannot understand the subsequent vitality of Christianity in the world. Jesus' resurrec- tion is a necessity in Christianity, not just theologically, but logically, for the ambiguity inJesus' final days-the treachery of the pharisees, Jesus' betrayal by one of his own disciples, Pilot's condemnation, Jesus' own mental agony, his torture and death, the premature (so it must have seemed) closure to his minis- try-would hardly have provided a foundation for an ongoing religion. The resurrection, however, yields the answer to the riddle posed by the crucifixion and provides the indwelling power that manifests itself in the dynamic Chris- tian presence in the world. The uncertainties and ambiguities connected with the death of the Buddha similarly call for a resurrection. Such a "resurrection" did occur in Buddhism; in fact, it stands at the very heart of the ongoing tradition. One may of course speak of such a resurrection of the Buddha's presence in the dharma and vinaya, but these are typologically removed from the kinds of noninstitutional images brought forward by Mitchell.18 However, there are other images in which the Buddha, although passed beyond, is mysteriously present in certain liturgically empowered structures and symbols and in certain people.'9 One kind of resurrection occurs in the stapa, the funerary mound enshrining the Buddha's postcremation relics. Through rituals connected with the stupa, the Buddha can become alive and tangibly present.20 Other kinds of resurrection occur through the means of images such as the anthropomorphic buddha image2l and the mandala22 and in living saints.23 A final kind of resurrection occurs in the very being of the practitioner, who, containing within himself or herself the Buddha's enlightened essence (tathagatagarbha) or buddha nature (buddhagotra), "resurrects" that essence, so to speak, through the Buddhist spiritual disciplines.24 Conclusion Images connected with the death of the Buddha such as those just discussed have different implications for the presence of Buddhism in the world from the 175</page><page sequence="9">REGINALD RAY one summarized by Don Mitchell. These different implications would include the following. (1) The world is admitted to be sorely afflicted with evil and suf- fering. (2) The Buddha has himself clearly shared and participated in the limi- tation, suffering, and death that mark the human condition. (3) The starkness with which the negativity of the world is etched in Buddhism clearly calls for response. (4) In the Buddhist context, response to this is understood as compas- sion, which becomes an imperative, being the guiding principle of the Bud- dha's own life and his primary injunction to his followers. (5) The Buddha's life and work are, in some important respects, incomplete. (6) The Buddha contin- ues to carry on his compassionate activity through his ongoing presence in sym- bols and in people. (7) The practitioner is enjoined to bring the Buddha's wis- dom and compassion to birth in himself or herself, to emulate the Buddha's self-sacrificing activity, and to work for the salvation of all beings. The historical record shows-and I am sorry that I cannot develop this point here-that more compassionate, active, and engaged images of the Buddha have been important in Buddhist traditions in all known Buddhist cultures, that these have been aligned with a socially involved theological posture, and that this in turn has been bound up with compassionate activity "in the world," so to speak. This is not, obviously, to say that Christianity and Buddhism are necessarily alike in their handling of the themes discussed above. When we compare Bud- dhism and Christianity on the matter of the deaths of their founders, we do find important differences-although both traditions acknowledge ambiguity, turmoil, and incompletion, the primary image of the Buddha still remains one of tranquillity, while that of Jesus is one of agony. But the Buddhists would emphatically insist that the Buddha's equanimity should not be taken to reflect an unawareness of suffering or indifference to it. That equanimity makes clear, rather, that, before one can truly help others, one must first fully understand one's own suffering and that this understanding can be attained only through fully experiencing and coming to terms with that suffering. The Buddha's tran- quillity further represents the stillness that, in Thomas Merton's words, "[is] filled with every possibility," the most important thing being, of course, the saving of the world.25 This is, after all, the vivid testimony of the Buddha's life: it was only after his enlightenment that he was able to set out to save all senti- ent beings. It may further be added that, in their experience of death, Sakyamuni and Jesus share not only the experience of agony but perhaps also that of peace. I refer here to the moment, as Jesus was dying, when he seems to have experienced the Buddha's transcendence. It is that moment on the cross when he was no longer struggling with his suffering, the moment when he cried out, "It is finished!" This was a moment, so we are told, of final accept- ance and victory. On the matter of their founders' deaths, then, Buddhism and Christianity share more than might at first be suspected. Yet they retain important differ- ences of perspective, emphasis, and method. To view differences such as these 176</page><page sequence="10">RESPONSE TO MITCHELL within a kind of competitive framework, as if it is a question of which is better or more appropriate within the current world situation, is completely to miss the unprecedented opportunity presented by contemporary Christian-Buddhist dialogue. We engage in dialogue not to disagree, even less to agree, but to see and to allow ourselves to be seen, to allow ourselves to be challenged and to challenge. This is, of course, the ground of all authentic communication. If we insist on holding rigidly to our personal and collective identities as Buddhists or Christians, we will succeed only in perpetuating the world's confusion and suf- fering. If, on the other hand, we are willing to enter into genuine dialogue with one another, we may hope to experience the outcome of all real communica- tion, including not only the pain of the death of the past but also, beyond that, the joy of resurrection into a new and transformed life.

For example, as mentioned, the text replaces the Buddha as teacher with the dharma and vinaya, suggesting that, henceforth, these are sufficient as the primary ref- erence point for the church. Moreover, the body of monastic regulations (vinaya) has evi- dently reached a point of considerable development, and we find reference to rules that may not be changed. In addition, the text makes reference to a canon (contents uncer- tain) and says that any further texts that may turn up can be accepted only if they accord with those already considered normative. 7. For example, those saints designated in Buddhism pratyekabuddha, or, in Jeffrey Hopkins' evocative translation, "solitary realizers." Jeffrey Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness (London: Wisdom Publications, 1983), pp. 106-108 and passim. 8. We in the West have a particular conception of life and death, deeply rooted in our Judeo-Christian heritage, that colors the way we understand those phenomena in other religions. Simply put, we assume-although we may no longer consciously believe- that each person has one life and dies only once. We further assume that the "story" of a given individual begins with her birth and ends with her death. We, including both the informed public and scholars, shape our understanding of Buddhism according to this mechanism, although conceptually we know that Buddhism does not conceive things in this way. 9. Let me give one of many possible examples. On one occasion, the Buddha tells the following story to his disciple Ananda. Once there were three princes wandering together in a wood. They came on a tigress lying half dead with starvation on the ground. Struggling at her belly were seven tiny cubs that had recently been born, trying to suckle. It was clear that the poor mother along with her little ones would soon be dead for she could not stand up, let alone search out prey. Nor was there any nourishment in 177</page><page sequence="11">REGINALD RAY the area that the princes could provide. Two of the princes shrank back from this sad scene, but the third, whose name was Mahasattva, felt great compassion for the mother and her kits. Seeing that only the sacrifice of his own person could save them, he asked his brothers to leave him alone for a while. He then threw himself down on the ground, but the tigress was too weak to take notice. Then he cut his own throat, and, at the scent of blood, the tigress woke from her stupor "and in no time ate up all the flesh and blood, leaving only the bones." The Buddha then concludes the story, remarking, "It was I, Ananda, who at that time and on that occasion was that prince Mahasattva." (Edward Conze, Buddhist Scriptures [Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1959], p. 26.) Because we in the West assume (although, again, we may not consciously believe) that the lives of animals have little significant value, we might seek to criticize the sacrifice of a human life for that of an animal. What is important here, however, and in the other similar Jataka stories of the self-sacrificing death of the Buddha, is the virtue of selfless love for another suffering being and a willingness to forgo one's own well-being in ser- vice of the other. 10. For example, Devadatta feels that the Buddha has allowed his disciples to com- promise their spiritual discipline to the point where it is no longer efficacious and pro- poses that a more rigorous code be imposed on them. On another occasion, when the Buddha is advanced in years, Devadatta tries to manipulate the Buddha into abdicating his position and letting him take over. On other occasions, Devadatta tries to kill the Buddha by putting poison under his fingernails and trying to scratch his master, by inducing assassins to murder him, by rolling a huge boulder down on him, and by let- ting loose a mad elephant on him. On Devadatta, see Biswadeb Mukherjee, Die Uber- lieferung von Devadatta, dem Widersacher des Buddha, in den kanonischen Schriften (Munich: In Commision BeiJ. Kitzinger, 1966). 11. SeeJohn Strong, Legendand Cult of Upagupta (Princeton, NewJersey: Princeton University Press, 1991). 12. This decline is usually said to occur by stages. In one version (the Mahdsamnipdta Sutra), the decline of the dharma is divided into five five-hundred-year periods, with each period marked by particular characteristics: the faithful are strong (1) in direct real- ization of the truth (satydbhisamaya), (2) in meditation (samadhi, dhyana), (3) in tex- tual learning (sruta), (4) in building monasteries, and (5) in quarrels and blame, after which time the pure dharma becomes invisible (Etienne Lamotte, Histoire du Boud- dhisme Indien [Louvain: Institut Orientaliste, 1958]: 214-215). 13.

Underlying the various forms is the notion that the Buddha's innermost essence is not unique to him but has been actualized in other buddhas in other times and places. Moreover, it is present, if hidden, in the very nature of reality itself, the dharma, in the Buddha's dharmakaya (body of ultimate reality), consubstantial with reality itself. This affirms his ongoing presence in the world and his ability to reveal himself in it. (See Frank E. Reynolds and Charles Hallisey, "Buddha," in The Encyclopedia of Religion [hereinafter ER], ed. Mircea Eliade [New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1987], 2: 319-333.) 20. In life, the Buddha's body was understood as imbued with his enlightenment. 178</page><page sequence="12">RESPONSE TO MITCHELL When that body was cremated, its remains (bones and ashes) were believed to continue to embody the Buddha's realization and to be imbued with his enlightened essence. From an early time, structures called stupa were built to contain these remains. Once rit- ually empowered, the stupa was considered to be a real and literal body of the Buddha no less than his body of flesh and blood. For at least some traditions, the stupa was and is understood, not primarily as a memorial, but as the living body of the Buddha, albeit in a different kind of body from his physical one. Through the liturgy connected with the stupa cult, suppliants were and are enabled to meet the Buddha face to face, in his ultimate body. What is the rationale of this transcendent, liturgical presence of the Bud- dha? In the Lotus Stutra, the Buddha says, in effect, "After my mortal body has gone, I incarnate in the stupa so that beings can come to see me and receive the benefits of my ongoing compassion." The stupa is a font of the compassionate activity of the Buddha in the world. At the stupa, through its symbolism and liturgies, people may continue to have contact with the departed master. (See Hirakawa Akira, "Stupa Worship," in ER, 14:92-96.) 21. About the time of the beginning of the common era, anthropomorphic images of the Buddha, sometimes containing relics, began to come into currency, and these, once empowered, functioned analogously to the stupa in rendering the Buddha present and alive (see Reynolds and Hallisey, "Buddha"). 22. In the context of tantric liturgies. 23. Certain realized saints who, owing to the fullness of their enlightenment and the identity of their realization with that of Sakyamuni Buddha, were seen as identical in essence with him. To cite just one example, in the Asokavaddna, King Asoka remarks to the saint Upagupta on the essential identity of Upagupta and the Buddha, "[Although I conquered the earth], my joy was not then what it is now that I have seen you, O elder. . . . Looking at you today I see in you the incomparable Self-existent Pure One, even though he is gone beyond" (John Strong, Legend of King Asoka [Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985], p. 242). 24. The Ratnagotravibh2ga remarks that, in a real sense, the very essence of the Bud- dha, his dharmakaya or "truth body," as well as his great compassion and other enlight- ened qualities are within each of us (see Jikido Takasaki, A Study on the Ratnago- travibhaga [Uttara Tantra]: Being a Treatise on the Tathagatagarbha Theory of Mahdydna Buddhism [Rome: Istituto Italiano Per II Medio Ed Estremo Oriente, 1966]). The only difference between us and the Buddha-and this is both a big difference and a very little one-is that he has realized this nature and we have not. How does one bring to maturation the buddha essence? Through meditation and the practice of compassion. In reference to this latter, in the Mahayana tradition, the practitioner takes the bodhi- sattva vow and accepts the injunction to imitate the Buddha's love for all beings: A Bodhisattva resolves: I take upon myself the burden of all suffering, I am resolved to do so, I will endure it. I do not turn or run away, do not tremble, am not terrified, nor afraid, do not turn back or despond. And why? At all costs I must bear the burdens of all beings. In that I do not follow my own inclinations. I have made the vow to save all beings. All beings must I set free. The whole world of living beings I must rescue, from the terrors of birth, of old age, of sickness, of death and rebirth, of all kinds of moral offence, of all states of woe, of the whole cycle of birth-and-death, of the jungle of false views, of the loss of wholesome dharmas, of the concomitants of ignorance,-from all these terrors I must rescue all beings.
