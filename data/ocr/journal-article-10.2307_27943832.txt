(Reviewed by Charles Milligan, Professor Emeritus, lliff School of Theology) The issues in Matters of Life and Death are animal rights, the right to die, suicide, abortion, pre-marital sex, and homosexuality. The introduction sets</page><page sequence="2">222 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy out "the perspective from which the language of rights is used." In John Cobb's version of an ethic of rights, norms are not merely matters of personal preference or emotive states, but inherent characteristics of human judgment. This is grounded in his process theism. . .. God's grace is God's own presence in the world, and God is genuinely empathetic with the world, rejoicing with those who rejoice and suffering with those who suffer. I find this message in Jesus, and it deeply informs my understanding of Christian faith and its ethical expresston. (13) This renders some later passages more understandable than they otherwise would be. He rejects insulated individualism and absolutism, as well as "the anthropocentrism that has dominated our ethics." That does not absolve us from the onus of making judgments with respect to life's forced options. The creation myth in Genesis "focuses on the goodness of the whole creation," and Cobb argues that the dominion given humans over "lesser" creatures means exercising a caring and responsible co-existence with them. He is not engaged in simplistic proof-texting and repeatedly states that responsible Christianity requires reinterpretation of some themes of the Bible, and, in some cases, rejection of time-honored texts and views. This is accomplished by shifting the discussion from law to rights. Animals have varying degrees of rights according to their mental and emotional capacity. Above all, "they have the right to be relatively free from suffering." To inflict suffering on a calf to produce veal "is to inflict suffering on God as well." This view contains a serious indictment of western traditions of unrestrained torture and killing and also of the church, which "has stood silently by and even actively supported cruelty." Cobb's argument is not based on either romanticism or anthropomorphic projection, but on the theological claim that God is the fellow-sufferer who understands, to borrow WIYrtehead's phrase. This view commends, but does not require, vegetarianism. Brief attention is given to the profligate destruction of species?especially of insect and plant forms?currently taking place. The test of suffering cannot apply there, but the holistic claim does. "The whole [biosphere] is not merely the sum of the parts but also a unity that includes those parts in their diversity and in all the patterns of relationship that are enriched by diversity" (42). In the chapter on the right to die, major attention is devoted to the opposition's argument that since human life is sacred, it is sinful to permit withdrawal of life support systems from dying patients. That objection is mistaken, he claims, because only God is sacred. The real issue is whether</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 13, No. 3, September 1992 223 others "have the right to force one to live when one wants to die." This leads?quite consistently, I believe?to affirming that suicide be accepted as a basic right to be opposed only when it can be shown that the legitimate needs of others, or the deeper interests of the person contemplating it, outweigh the right. (58) It follows that there needs to be the right for assisted suicide where the person wanting desperately to die has neither access nor capacity to accomplish the final exit. Of course, Cobb spells out safeguards which must be present to prevent abuse of the right in circumstances that are not extreme. The chapter on abortton rights is cogent and persuasive. Perhaps the central point is that the fertilized ovum, embryo, or fetus is not a human being, is not a baby, is not a child. The value of these forms of life lies in their potentiality for humanity. An important observation is that "as long as many people believe and teach that feticide is a terrible sin, grief is compounded with guilt." Recognizing the impact of the sexual revolution, the liberation of women, and the advent of reliable contraception, it is now widely accepted that sex and its pleasures are not evil and dirty, but "gifts of God," to be used responsibly and in ways "faithful to Jesus Christ." This makes pre-marital sexual activity permissible under conditions of responsible commitment, a view similar to Judge Ben Lindsay's recommendation for "compantonate marriage" seventy years ago. This proposal is far more acceptable today because "Christian parents have accepted sexual practices on the part of their children along the lines of commitment described." The argument advanced with regard to homosexuality is that the cruel tradition of homophobia is morally insupportable and misconstrues the so called biblical basis. Although I agree substantially with the stands that Cobb takes, I have disagreements along the paths he takes to get there. A major one is his biblicism: "it is a good rule for Christians to consider the biblical contribution to the discussion first." That compounds the problem. Christians who opposed slavery did not do so because they consulted the Bible first, but by using sensitive moral judgment as they looked at the facts of the peculiar institution. The defenders of slavery found their authority in the Bible insofar as it is accepted there. They were right about the Bible, wrong about the morality. Ditto women's rights. The Good Samaritan did not first look into a book; he looked at a human being and the actual circumstances. On such issues as those dealt with here, I think Christians (or anybody else) better took at the facts first. The problem with the biblical approach to</page><page sequence="4">224 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy contemporary ethics is that it winds up in arguments about the Bible rather than about life and its values. The ethical problem is not to save face for the Bible, it is to save and elicit creative values for the living environment and for humans. I believe John Cobb would agree with that, but he seems to impute a type of moral authority to the Bible which simply will not stand up. Minor differences are, for example, that the narrow definition of euthanasia (47) confuses the issues. Assisted suicide is one form of "good death" or euthanasia. The semantic quarrel over the term sacred is, I believe, far less at issue than the ancient and persistent superstition of fatalism. Also, I do not believe dominion over nature in the Bible has the laudable ecological meaning that Cobb finds. This is ironic since there is a minority strand running through the Hebrew scriptures which is far more ecologically sensitive than the priestly document or the few nature references in the New Testament. Again, "the fertilized ovum certainly has a right to live." Certainly? That there are "always negative consequences" in the decision to abort does not square with my counseling experience or that of female counselors whose judgment I trust. But these are small objections. I must add that there are fine insights, such as, that "brutality to others brutalizes its perpetrators," and "The human quest for the good life will continue to degrade the environment unless the understanding of the good life changes." The burden of the Daly and Cobb volume, For the Common Good, is that an economic system ought to operate in ways that serve the interests of human beings and their communities, including the community of biodiversity. This requires an approximation of justice, long-range practicality, responsibility toward future generations, and sustainable effects upon nature and its re-sources. In short, an economic system should be practical, intelligent, and responsible. That is asking a great deal. For an economic system to operate in such fashion there must be a theoretical basis geared to such purposes as well as policies and programs that are demonstrably effective toward those ends. In both theory and practice, the conventional establishment?whether communist or capitalist has been a massive disaster. The major theoretic flaw has been a stubborn insistence on attending to a closed system of abstractions, taking care to avoid being in touch with the actualities of living (and dying) persons and communities. To use a simple example, the mean average household increase in income in the United States during the 1980s was 40.95 percent. That sounds good. If, however, you draw closer to actual people by comparing characteristic groups, the "mean" is exposed as meaningless. For the wealthiest one percent saw their incomes increase by 87.1 percent, while the poorest twenty percent of the population saw their household incomes fall by 5.2 percent. So much for the trickle-down theory. This simple</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 13, No. 3, September 1992 225 example is an attempt to convey how far removed from reality academic economics can get when it excludes from attention actual people in their actual circumstances. As Simonde de Sismondi put it in 1827, Humanity should be on guard against all generalization of ideas that causes us to lose sight of the facts, and above all against the error of identifying the public good with wealth, abstracted from the sufferings of the human beings who create it. (36) The book pursues this in relentless detail. Particularly important is the use of the Gross National Product (GNP) index to indicate the health of a society. It is not only a "poor measure of welfare, it is also a poor measure of income." The most important abstraction in establishment economics is "that of Homo economicusirom real flesh-and-blood human beings." The abstraction portrays humans as selfish, atomistic individuals. When a case of altruism or community realities occurs, there is a strong tendency by economists to explain it away as being due either to ignorance or shrewd self-interest (90). This reductionist view of human motivation and neglect of the importance of communal ties leads to systematic distortion when applied to the broad range of social interpretation and policy. It is not that working with abstractions is illicit, but that failing to perceive that your theoretic constructs are abstrac tions results in facile and erroneous applications. Economists enter "the arena of explanation of aspects of what transpires in the real world" and offer "recommendations for policymakers and business" people, too often with results damaging to public well-being (95). This is highly unfortunate in relation to nature, its health and resources. In conventional economics nature is "land," and land is taken to mean the forces of nature so far as they have economic significance. Just as policies derived from a discipline that knows nothing of human community are destructive of that community, so policies derived from a discipline that knows nothing of the physical world are destructive of that world. (100) Such a concept of land, value determined by market price, has no grasp of the limited quantity of non-renewable resources, the absolute necessity for sustainable use of renewable resources, or the moral obligation toward future generations, let alone toward other living creatures. This spells ecological disaster and, in fact, does not work well in the marketplace. For example, bankruptcies rose twenty-one percent in 1991 over 1990, which was the seventh consecutive yearly increase. Of the 944,000 bankruptcies, 868,480</page><page sequence="6">226 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy were of individuals (AP Feb. 3, 1992). Daly and Cobb provide a wide range of citations marking the difference between economics confined to the world of the manipulation of profit and wealth (chrematistics) and economics as having to do with human well-being, including the household, community, institutions, and environment (oikonomia). The authors were particularly critical of economics as a quantitative discipline and the departmental structure of higher education. Departments vie for recognition and financial support; individuals for advancement and status. This invites some convenient form of quantitative measurement. Like the dentist evaluated on number of teeth pulled, the university professor is evaluated by articles published. Miraculously, the number of publications has soared. Is it because professors now work harder? Certainly they work harder at publishing, but less hard at teaching in many cases. They also work harder at creative adaptations: ways to serve the index directly while totally bypassing the reality which the index was supposed to reflect. (149) This calls to mind Whitehead's observations, written in 1928: It must not be supposed that the output of a university in the form of original ideas is solely to be measured by printed papers and books labeled with the names of their authors.... Thus it would be the greatest mistake to estimate the value of each member of a faculty by the printed work signed in his name. (The Aims of Education, chap. 7) The criticism is well taken, although if some of the ideas expounded are as foolish as our authors claim-and I believe they are-it is probably beneficial to keep such writers at their word processors and out of the classroom. Daly and Cobb focus their criticism on the departmental structure. Although I agree with most of their criticisms, it does not seem to me that structural reorganization is a solution to the extent claimed. Centers which cross departmental boundaries have no more immunity from empire building and turf protection than departments do. As for their criticism of conventional contemporary economics-also well taken-there are many economists who do their work in the style of oikonomia, as, indeed, the wealth of quotations from them attests in this book. The discussion of energy provides an excellent supplement to The Liberation of Life (1981) by Charles Birch and John Cobb. For economic policies and theories constitute a major obstacle to ecological responsibility.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 13, No. 3, September 1992 227 The shift proposed here is from thinking in terms of matter and rent to energy and biosphere. The biosphere is "a society of societies." "To view human relations with other living things in the context of a community of communities is to move into a btocentric vision" (203). This presents a challenge to conventional theology as a variety of versions of biotic vision makes clear (370-94). The concluding chapter presents the case for an ecological theism among these types. At times this approaches pantheism: "whatever else God is, God is also the inclusive whole" (387). Each event is a response to its world; it is not an inert product. "However it is named, it [the Whiteheadian lure] points to a pervasive feature of the totality within which all events occur. ... We believe this to be universal throughout the cosmos.... We call it God" (394). However, the major emphasis of his theocentrism is in terms of a personalista naturalism and is expressed in conventional theological language of God's purposes, caring, suffering, and human idolatry, even the hope that a future generation "will learn to forgive this generation its blind commitment to ever greater consumption" (400). I can't see any reason why they should, since we can no tenger plead ignorance. I understand what is meant by idolatry and agree with what is meant, but I do not find such terminology illuminating in relation to these problems. I should at least mention some of the positions taken in this important book. There is opposition to free trade, the goal of economic growth, urban industrial development, open immigration, the ever expanding arms trade, the centralized nation-state. They favor not only community building, but something akin to states-rights in a national confederation, limited inequality, users' tax, an environmental tax such that environmental costs would be charged at the source of development and environmental damage be paid for by those who inflict it. The most interesting thing about these?and other?positions taken is the arguments presented in their support. Unfortunately, that nation-states are in disarray everywhere does not support the conclusion that states or ethnic enclaves would do any better. The record of state legislatures is not encouraging, and the fierce ethnic wars taking place raise questions about the desirability of transposing the community model to larger entities. What we need in our cities is to be sure of a greater sense of civic responsibility and spirit of cooperation, but, even more critically, efficient management and effective flow of goods and services, which presuppose full employment and doors of opportunity. I hasten to add that the authors have forced me to re-think many of these matters and have contributed to my better understanding at many points. In conclusion, I want to indicate some ways in which this book, mainly on economics, is related to certain strands of American philosophy and religion. As such it is an example of the way that philosophical ideas and</page><page sequence="8">228 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy religious vitality enter into academic discourse and public debate, although that relationship may not be the theme dealt with at all. First of all, there is the processive way of thinking. The criticism of conventional economics is not merely that it is confined to abstractions, but also that these abstractions are static and fixed, whereas the authors think in terms of events, loyalties, values, commitments in a living world. Secondly, there is the presupposition of the reality of relations as impenetrating and constitutive, akin to James's radical empiricism. Or as Whitehead said, "how an actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual entity is." The emphasis on community and interacting communities would be meaningless apart from a functional or relational mode of understanding. Thirdly, there is this further theme of empiricism that theories are justified or to be rejected according to whether they prove effective in actual experience. I hesitate to call this pragmatism, because the term is often equated with a simplistic sort of crass expediency, but in its developed philosophical sense that is what I mean. Not only is it found in James and Dewey, but it is a strand that runs persistently through American thought, that the proof is in the pudding, that theory must pan out in practice, and that religion ought to make a difference in life, contributing to one's quality of selfhood and strength of character. The book's theme that an economic system ought to contribute to the lives of people and their communities, enriching appreciative and fulfilling relationships with all life, is precisely a contemporary form of this deeply rooted American intellectual trait. The authors say at the outset that they have both been influenced by Whitehead's philosophy-which is evident in many places. I would add-and regard this as a high compliment-that the book is in the spirit of Henry George's 1879 classic Progress and Poverty.</page></plain_text>
