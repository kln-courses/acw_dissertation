<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KARAIM OF LITHUANIA: A CASE OF ETHNIC SURVIVAL Aleksandras Gedmintas, State University of New York at Delhi One of the more intriguing instances of ethnic group survival is the case of the Karaim of Lithuania. This small group has retained a separate identity in a diverse cultural milieu for well over 600 years. It has done so by maintaining its language, its traditions, and especially its religion. Even so, because of its size, this group is now in danger of melding into the larger culture in which it finds itself. It is at risk of social extinction. Yet little is known about the group. What is available is written in either Karaim itself, or in the languages of the local people among whom the Karaim find themselves. Few English sources exist, and what is available tends to focus on their religious uniqueness. This paper, then, is an attempt to address some of the deficiencies in knowledge about the Karaim. The Karaim are one of the officially recognized minority groups of Lithuania. By almost any standards, it is a tiny group. The Lithuanian State Nationalities Research Center puts the number of Karaim at 269.' While this small number by itself does not differentiate it from other groups (the same source lists thirteen ethnic groups having fewer numbers than the Karaim), what makes it unique is that Lithuania is the largest remaining center of activity for the Karaim. There are no other homelands, no other places of refuge, no other places of ethnic identity reaffirmation. If this center dissipates, so will the Karaim. There is a sense of finality about the future for both the Karaim and for others interested in them. Their 600-year-long existence as a separate group may indeed be coming to an end. Hence it is important that their emergence and evolution be documented, that there be a record attesting to their tenacious existence, and that their experiences be disseminated to a larger audience. The present center of Karaim activity in Lithuania is in the town of Trakai, about 20 kilometers to the southwest of the capital Vilnius. Indeed, Trakai has been the traditional center for the Karaim for most of their 600 years of existence. There are other communities in Lithuania, notably a small number of families in Panevéžys and in Vilnius. Two other small communities have had historical ties to the Lithuanian Karaim, one at Lutsk, and the other in Halich, formerly in Poland and now in Ukraine. JBS, Vol. XXVIII No 3 (Fall 1997) 235</page><page sequence="2">236 Aleksandras Gedmintas Social science literatuře is rich with analyses of ethnic identity maintenance, ethnic conflict and other issues related to ethnicity. Examples of ethnogenesis, on the other hand, are relatively scarce.2 Most documented cases of ethnogenesis, written as they are by social scientists, focus on the dynamics of the present. Attempts at historical analysis of ethnogenesis are limited simply because of lack of documentation. The Karaim pose an entirely different situation. Because they have always maintained a certain uniqueness in their political, social and religious affairs, substantial historical documentation can be drawn upon to exhibit their processes of ethnogenesis. However, because of their small numbers, the dispersed nature of their communities, and because of the difficulty of conducting any kind of ethnically-based social science research in the former Soviet Union, almost nothing is known from direct observation about present-day Karaim organization, social structure, or ethnicity. The Origins of the Karaim The origins of the Karaim are to be found in Khazaria, a medieval state spanning the steppe regions between the Caspian Sea, the rivers Don and Volga, and the Caucasus Mountains. It was a confederation of Turkic tribes that controlled the important trade routes between the East and the West. By the sixth century A.D. Khazaria had acquired enough power to warrant defensive postures from the Persian Empire to its south. The Emperor Khosro I Anoshervan (53 1-578) fortified the border between the two powers with the fortress of Darband and with a wall barring the passage to the Transcaucasus at the Caspian coast.3 In developing this relationship of enmity with its southern neighbors, Khazaria sought to establish closer ties with the emergent power to its west, Byzantium. In the year 626 an alliance was made between the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius and the Khazar kaghan, providing arms and supplies for the ruler's expedition against Persia. This relationship of relative amity even led to dynastic union, with Justinian II marrying the kaghan'' s sister, later to be known as Theodora, and with the marriage of Constantine V and Irene, a Khazarian princess, whose son Leo IV has been labeled as "the Khazar."4 These alliances with Byzantium were not enough to hold off the double threats to Khazaria in the 10th century. In the south the Persian Empire had succumbed to the power of a militant new religion, Islam, which kept continuous pressure on its northern neighbor. But it was Khazaria' s northern flank which proved to be its downfall. In 965 Kievan Russian forces under the leadership of Sviatoslav dealt Khazaria a blow from which</page><page sequence="3">The Karaim of Lithuania 237 it could not recover. By the middle of the 11th century, Khazaria disappeared as an independent state. At the height of its power, Khazaria became the springboard for the spread of a new religion based on Mosaic law: Karaism. (As used here, the term "Karaism" will refer to the religion, "Karaite" to the follower of the religion, and "Karaim" to the Turkic ethnic group practicing this religion.) This sect originated among Jews in Mesopotamia in the eighth century, and spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean area in the centuries immediately afterward. It seems to have been a reaction to the growing reliance of mainstream Judaism on Talmudic teachings and to the growing power of the rabbis, the teachers of the oral laws. Karaites rejected this reliance on the Talmud and made the literal teaching of the Bible the only infallible source and test of religious truth and observance.5 Khazarian contact with Byzantium allowed Karaite missionaries to reach the Crimean peninsula at the turn of the ninth century. There, the sect found hospitable conditions. Perhaps because of Khazaria's strategic position for trade, its precarious position between two great superpowers of the time, and its political composition as a confederation of Turkic tribes, the kaghans, or leaders of the state, fostered an atmosphere of religious tolerance. The neither imposed their shamanistic beliefs on foreigners, nor rejected outside religious influences outright. Indeed, religious conversions were common. Thus it is stated in Karaim tradition that the kaghan Bulan actually converted to Karaism, along with his family and his court.6 Apparently this conversion to a Mosaic based religion also had a political effect, since it defused any possible slight to Christian Byzantium or to Muslim Persia.7 It should be noted that some scholars of Jewish history dispute this interpretation of the Khazar-Karaite link. They claim that it is based on questionable assumptions and assertions made by the Karaim Abraham Firkovich from Lutsk in the nineteenth century. Nathan Shur, for example, calls it "the most exotic" of interpretations.* Karaim scholars, however, greatly value Firkovich's work, crediting him not only with the development of the Khazar-Karaite link, but also with historical justifications for the return to the Karaim of privileges which were abrogated during the Russian Empire's occupation of Poland and Lithuania.9 Whether the question of the Khazar-Karaite link will be ever fully resolved is, of course, a matter of conjecture. What can be said, however, is that this interpretation provides the present-day Karaim with an historical sense of separateness, a means by which they can differentiate themselves not only from the larger cultural milieu, but also from Jews, with whom they have been in close association through their history.</page><page sequence="4">238 Aleksandras Gedmintas The disintegration of the Khazarian Empire did not end Turkic influence in the area. In the eleventh century the Polovtsi, or Komans (Cumans, Kumani) occupied the southern steppes on the Dnieper River, and extended their influence into Crimea. It is here that Karaim scholars see their direct origins,10 for it is in Crimea that the unique blend of Mosaic religion melds with Turkic culture and language to form the basis of Karaim ethnicity, and separates the Karaim from other Karaites. Karaim tradition indicates that they arrived in Lithuania during the campaigns of the Grand Duke Vytautas against the Golden Horde at the end of the fourteenth century. It was his policy to open the Grand Duchy to outside influences, to lead Lithuania into the modern world of the time. As Talko-Hryncevich states, Vytautas was "an administrator eagerly devoted to the task of economic improvement of his vast desert areas; he settled in colonies of foreigners, captives taken at war, or attracted them with privileges not only for the defense of the country but first of all having in view the development of agriculture, industry and commerce.'"1 Indeed, not only were the Karaim affected by this policy, but likewise Tartars and Jews, who, like the Karaim, maintained separate identities even to the present. Whether Vytautas brought the Karaim to Lithuania directly from the Crimea, as most sources seem to indicate, or whether he persuaded a number of them to leave Lutsk to settle in Trakai, as Baliulis and others claim,12 is not definitively known. What is known is that at the end of the fourteenth century Trakai already had a substantial Karaim population. Most sources do agree that Vytautas granted special privileges to the Karaim community in Trakai.13 Although nothing official has survived, later documents attest to such privileges. It seems possible that in addition to Vytautas' desire to open his country to outside influences, he also brought the Karaim to Lithuania to act as palace guards for his stronghold at Trakai, as was often the custom in the Middle Ages, as, for example, the bringing of the Varangians to Byzantium; thus, the privileges may have been the price for their military support. In 1441 Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, granted the Karaim the so-called Magdeburg rights. These rights allowed the Karaim of Trakai the same legal status as other cities in the kingdom. In effect the Karaim community became a town within a town. It had its own elected leader, the vaitas (Polish wójt), although he was nominated by the vaivadas, or district head, with the consent of the Grand Duke. It had its own legal jurisdiction, at least as far as intra-Karaim relations were concerned, and it had its own administrative capabilities, including the collection of taxes to support the town. In return the community had to pay the Grand Duke a yearly tax, just as in all cities having the Magdeburg privileges.14 Conflicts involving</page><page sequence="5">The Karaim of Lithuania 239 non-Karaim were to be judged by the vaivadas or his representative. It was the granting of these privileges to the Karaim that provided the pattern of separateness in Karaim inter-community relations, deflecting, to a substantial degree, assimilative pressures. The fifteenth century was a period of relative growth and prosperity for the Karaim of Lithuania, as exemplified by the Trakai community. There, the Karaim engaged in their traditional military occupations, and some of them were able to achieve positions of leadership. It is also possible that there was a separate Karaim unit within the military.15 The majority of the Karaim population were civilians, however, engaged in agriculture, where they specialized in growing "oriental" vegetables such as cucumbers, in the trades, and in small business ownership. Karaim also served as interpreters and intermediaries in the Grand Duchy's relations with the Golden Horde.16 The end of the fifteenth century, however, brought the first of many subsequent hardships for the Karaim. In 1495 Grand Duke Alexander expelled all Jews from Lithuanian territory. The ostensible reason was to purify the religious state of the Grand Duchy. According to Baliulis and others, more probably it was to seize Jewish wealth and allay some of the Grand Duchy's debt.17 The Karaim were included in this edict of expulsion, and they had to abandon their communities. Although the edict was rescinded in 1503, those who returned found their properties sold and had to purchase them anew. Wars likewise had devastating effects on Karaim communities. Trakai and its Karaims suffered severely during the wars of Poland-Lithuania with Muscovy and the Cossacks in the mid-seventeenth century. Sparse records indicate that there were only 36 people left in the town after the war, with the number of Karaim unknown.18 By 1657 some Karaim were present, since a meeting was held in which the participants are described as "spared from the sword, the remnants of the refugees, who are afflicted by constant troubles. As the misfortunes increased, the hands became slack, and the souls weary.'"9 Karaim communities outside of Lithuania also had their share of tragedies. The community in Lutsk is a good example. Throughout the sixteenth century the number of families averaged in the low twenties, with a probable total population of about a hundred. In 1650 there were only three families recorded in the local archives, the severe decline most probably due to the effects of Bohdan Khmelnitsky's (Pol. Chmielnicki) Cossack uprising in 1648. The community rebounded quickly, however, for by 1663 their numbers returned to 21 families.20 These catastrophic events, in addition to the devastation of sporadic epidemics such as the plague of 1710, had an overall depressing effect on the total number of Karaim in Lithuania and Poland. Sulimowicz states</page><page sequence="6">240 Aleksandras Gedmintas that in the seventeenth century there were 32 Karaim settlements in the Polish-Lithuanian republic, although the population was numbered in the hundreds rather than in the thousands.21 By the early twentieth century, only five settlements remained: Trakai, Vilnius, Panevéžys in Lithuania, Lutsk and Halich in Ukraine. After the partition of Poland and Lithuania in the late eighteenth century, the Karaim strove to reestablish their traditional rights and their separateness against the generally anti-Semitic views and policies of the Tsarist regimes. The effort was rewarded in 1863, when the Russian authorities granted partial rights and privileges to the Karaim of the Western provinces, that is, those of Poland and Lithuania. These were essentially the same as those granted by them earlier to the Crimean Karaim. The western Karaim were allowed to have their own religious leader, they were absolved of military service, and were granted the same rights as other subjects of the empire.22 They also were able to officially disassociate themselves from the Jews of the empire, being labeled solely as Karaim, rather than Jews-Karaim.23 This last was significant, since it was this official distancing from the Jews which allowed the major portion of the small Karaim population to survive the Holocaust during the Second World War.24 It also had the concurrent effect of creating the conditions necessary for the development of an ethnic identity separate from the Karaims' religious base. Karaim scholars and others began to explore language and cultural ties to their Turkic ancestry. The restoration Poland's independence helped to continue this cultural florescence. The Trakai and the Vilnius communities remained the center of Karaim activity. It was here, for instance, that ajournai of Karaimica, Myâ Karaimska, was published. Since Vilnius and Trakai were then under Polish rule, the language of publication was Polish, although tracts in the native language also appeared. Plenary meetings of all Karaim were also held in Trakai. The end of World War II saw the return of the Vilnius territory to Lithuania, then under Soviet domination. The Karaim of Lithuania, much as other ethnic and religious groups, were significantly affected during this fifty-year period. Official Soviet policy discouraged religious manifestations and encouraged ethnic assimilation. Karaim community rights were abrogated, kenessas, or places of worship, were confiscated, and religious and cultural activity slowed significantly. Restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1991 has allowed the Karaim a measure of hope. The kenessa at Trakai has been returned and restored. A small museum offers the community and others a glimpse of their cultural past. In 1993 the kenessa in Vilnius was restored and reopened. Plenary meetings of all Karaim have resumed. The meeting</page><page sequence="7">The Karaim of Lithuania 24 1 held in November of 1992 in Trakai drew participants from all remaining Eastern European Karaim communities, including those in Lutsk and Halich. Study of the Karaim language has been reinstituted. Of interest is that the meeting of 1991 had presentations in Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, and in Karaim, reflecting the diverse circumstances of Karaim communities, as well as the problems that the Karaim face in maintaining their ethnic identity. The Emergence of Karaim Identity The question of Karaim identity is a complex one. There are at least three components to their identity - religious, territorial, and cultural. What follows is a brief examination of these components, and the interactions among them in maintaining Karaim identity. Foremost of these components is their religion, Karaism. It is this component which has sustained their corporateness under adverse circumstances, and which has allowed them to maintain a separate identity over their six hundred years of existence in Lithuania. Without their strong religious ties, they would surely have assimilated into the larger society. The development of Karaism has been covered in another section of this paper. Here we shall give an overview of some of the characteristics of the religion which have a direct impact on the process of identity maintenance. Karaism differs from other religions based on Mosaic doctrines in that it accepts only one authority, that of the literal reading of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament.25 All that is necessary for the achievement of spiritual truth is the literal reading of the Bible. Readers may thus reach the truth without referring to others for religious interpretations. In this they differentiate themselves from rabbinical Judaism. It is this characteristic which gave birth to the religion in the middle of the eighth century, apparently as a reaction to the growing influence of rabbis and to the growing reliance on the Talmud for the delineation of religious law in Jewish communities.26 In its period of growth, Karaism also incorporated a number of traits characteristic of another growing religious force, Islam. The principle of analogy, the acceptance of both Christ and Mohammed as prophets sent by God to their respective people, and the avoidance of anthropomorphic expressions relating to God all seem to have entered Karaite thought via contact with Islam.27 This association with both Judaism and Islam would have a profound effect on identity maintenance of later Karaim in the predominantly Christian milieu of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia. Karaism's insistence on the reading of the Pentateuch for guidance in religious law led to a strong interest in linguistic studies among later</page><page sequence="8">242 Aleksandras Gedmintas Karaim. Existing Karaite communities in Khazaria spoke the Turkic-based languages of the local populations. A. Samoylovitch claims that the Karaim wrote and spoke in the Turkic dialect of Komans-Kipchak before the arrival of the Mongols in the Crimean region in the thirteenth century.28 Their adoption of Karaism necessitated a fairly literal translation of the Hebrew Bible into the native tongue. Such linguistic enterprises broadened to include literature and poetry. Thus it was the requirement of knowing the religion through reading the Bible that created the conditions through which ethnic separateness could be maintained over the centuries. Hebrew continued to be used in parts of the Karaim liturgy, and it seems to have been common in non-ritualistic contexts also, specifically in Karaim relations with the Jews. This was especially true from the sixteenth century, when the secular authorities in Lithuania, Poland and Russia tended to treat both communities alike, and the Karaim were forced into dealing with the larger Jewish community. Jacob Mann's impressive overview of extant Karaim documents details some of these communications. Through their history, the Karaim have also been adept at acquiring the language of the larger cultural milieu, be it Russian, or Polish, or Lithuanian. It is this characteristic which aided them in maintaining generally amicable relationships outside their communities. Karaim readily accepted, for example, translations of Polish literature into their language, and by the twentieth century Karaim were contributing works of literature in the lingua franca of the larger communities. Of course, this was a double edged sword for the Karaim, for while it did help them to adapt to the large community, and thus to avoid some potential ethnic conflict, it did expose them to assimilative pressures that stress their communities even today. Territory is also a major component in defining Karaim identity. As a religion Karaism has survived in widely dispersed and small communities throughout the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. Even though the religion is believed to have been founded in Iraq, the spiritual center of Karaism has always been Jerusalem, where its most ancient temple, or kenessa, is located. One of the greatest honors for a Karaite even today is to make a holy pilgrimage to the city to visit the site. Interestingly, Karaim label those who have made the journey as hadj, borrowing the term from their Muslim counterparts.29 Thus, the disparate communities maintained a web of communication, using religion as the primary bond. Socially, however, the situation was more difficult. The basic needs of daily existence had to be met. Goods had to be produced and traded, marriages had to be arranged. Communities had to rely on local non-Karaite populations for normal social intercourse.</page><page sequence="9">The Karaim of Lithuania 243 The Karaim of Lithuania Today The Karaim of Lithuania were fortunate in that they were able to establish basic territorial and economic rights early in their communal existence. Although there are no extant documents, later records refer to such rights granted to the Karaim by the Grand Duke Vytautas in the fourteenth century.30 These rights allowed the Karaim a relatively free and peaceful mode of interaction with the local populations. The interactions created a sense of territorial identity, a sense of uniqueness. A result of this was an increasing social distance among Karaim communities specifically, and among Karaite communities more generally, with increasing physical distance. An example of this is the arrangement of marriage, a very real problem especially for modern Karaim, according to the present spiritual head of the Karaim.31 Karaim tend to be endogamous. Because of the relatively small size of the Lithuanian community, suitable mates are not readily available for those ready for marriage. Brethren Karaim communities in Lutsk and Halich can provide acceptable marriage partners. But these communities are even smaller than the one in Lithuania, and thus a third alternative is the Crimean Karaim population. The language of communication among these communities, especially for the young, tends to be Russian, due to its familiarity during the Soviet period. (The Turkic Karaim language is a less reliable lingua franca, since some of the young know it, some do not, a situation somewhat analogous to the use of the Lithuanian language in the interactions among young Lithuanian- Americans.) A last alternative is, of course, marriage to a non-Karaim Karaite. The latter two pose significant difficulties of arrangement due to distances and political boundaries. Effectively, then, there is a limited marriage pool, based on social and physical distance. A Lithuanian Karaim marriage partner is preferable to a Polish one (that is, from Lutsk), which is still more preferable to a Ukrainian one, which, in turn, is better than the Crimean alternative, while all of the preceding would be preferable to a non-Karaim Karaite. Thus, for a Karaim being a Lithuanian does matter. So does being a Pole or a Ukrainian. Each Karaim feels rights and responsibilities to whatever sovereign power rules their territory. Lithuanian Karaim participate fully in national economic, political and social structures. In 1992, for example, Helena Kobeckaite, a prominent Karaim, was the Minister of Minorities in the Lithuanian government, and as such was instrumental in formulating minority strategies in the newly emergent Lithuanian state. Karaim from the past likewise achieved significant positions in their respective territorial administrations. In the</page><page sequence="10">244 Aleksandras Gedmintas seventeenth century Elias Karaimovich, the leader of the Kazaks, and the flag-bearer Menash, both participated in Sigismund Ill's expedition to Moscow.32 Zarach Natanovich and Abraham ben Josijahu were court physicians to John Sobieski III, while Ezra ha-Rofe was the court physician to the Radziwill (Lith. Radvilas) family.33 Nathan Shur somewhat dispara- gingly calls the ability of the Karaim to adapt to local circumstances as "taking on the color of their background,"34 akin to a chameleon. But in terms of survival, this process has served them well. Finally, it should be mentioned that marriage outside of the group, while frowned upon, does indeed occur. Because the Karaim do not proselytize, they do not accept "neophytes" into the group,35 and hence spouses are not eligible to join. This has the effect of pulling the Karaim spouse away from the community, a very real source of loss which the group can ill afford. The cultural aspect of Karaim identity also poses some interesting questions. Throughout their six hundred years of existence in Eastern Europe, they have had to adapt to local cultural customs and adopt local cultural traits. Only a few of their Turkic-based cultural traits remain to act as boundary maintenance mechanisms, serving to identify them and differentiate them from the larger population.36 Outsiders generally focus on two factors which they consider distinct Karaim characteristics. In tours through Trakai, the traditional center of the Karaim in Eastern Europe, attention is always brought to the "typical" Karaim house. The defining characteristic of this house is a three-windowed, street-facing wall. This style does indeed identify the Karaim quarter of Trakai. Whether the Karaim accept this characterization them-selves is not apparent. Even Zajqckowski, who specifically discusses cultural retentions, does not mention this. However, the fact that the outside community does associate this style with the Karaim serves to separate group, and gives it a uniqueness which it otherwise might not have. A culinary trait which serves in the same fashion is the kibin, an oval bun stuffed with meat and baked on a fire. Restaurants in Trakai will serve this as an example of Karaim fare and tourists are encouraged to experience it. There is stronger reason to believe that this food item is indeed a cultural retention. Whereas the three-windowed house in Trakai may be a local trait, not characteristic of all of the Karaim communities, the kibin seems to be ubiquitous in all Karaim groups. Zajqckowski identifies it, as well as a number of other foods, as evidence of Karaim Turkish connections. Further, he mentions articles of attire, myths, proverbs, soothsayings, and medicinal remedies as cultural remnants from Karaim Turkic roots.37 But despite these, the number of distinct Karaim cultural traits is limited. In part, this may be the result of a sparse ethnographic</page><page sequence="11">The Karaim of Lithuania 245 record. As Zajackowski himself says, "Karaim ethnography is awaiting its scholarly explorer."38 A more likely explanation, however, is that their Turkish base is gradually eroding under the forces of assimilation, thus leaving the bonds of religion, language and territoriality as primary group identifiers. Whether these are enough for the Karaim to retain their unique identity remains to be studied.39 Notes 1.
