In particular, at a time when a large-scale project such as building or repairing a Main Hall required sizable funding, many temples often turned to holding kaich6 events, during which lay Buddhists evinced a spectacular enthusiasm for the secret Buddhas that were on display. Through the example of Zenk6ji, this article reveals that the popularity of kaich6, which was unique to Japanese Buddhist culture, was fostered as well as manipulated within traditional Japanese ideas regarding yorishiro (lodging place), saijitsu (ritual date), and marebito (visitor- deity). The aura of secrecy and mystery surrounding, and inseparable from, kaich6 deities was used not only for the benefit of kaich6 temples but also for the benefit of kaich6 visitors.

The magni- tude of the building is imposing: its T-shaped wooden bell hammer (shumoku 4 7) measures 24 meters long, 54 meters deep, and 30 meters high. In construct- ing this building, Zenk6ji spent 24,577 koban gold ryo (KOBAYASHI 1979, 41-42).1 Given that it only held a land grant of 1,ooo koku in 1707, which would yield no more than 500 koban gold ryo a year as a regular source of income, how was Zenkoji able to raise the huge amount required for building expenses? The answer lies in the kaicho 1 R (lit. "opening of a curtain"), which was conducted for five and a half years between 1701 and 1706. These kaicho exhibitions, which were known as "all-around-the-country" (kaikoku [NI) kaich&amp;, enabled the Zenk6ji administration to generate an income of more than 23,000 koban gold ry6 during this time (KOBAYASHI 1979, 39-40). With this money, Zenk6ji was able to rebuild its Main Hall, which had been lost to a fire in 1642 and replaced with a temporary structure in 1650 and again in 1666. Throughout the late seventeenth century, Zenk6ji made vigorous efforts to erect a new Main Hall. Prior to the major endeavor launched in 1701, in 1692- 1694 ZenkOji officials had thrown themselves into a Santo kaich6 -E-I M (a tri-city kaicho held at Ek6in 1[01J in Edo for 55 days, at Shinnyodo AU&amp; in Kyoto for 66 days, and at Tennoji 7S~I in Osaka for 54 days). The Santo kaicho of 1692-1694 turned out to be quite successful, netting more than 25,000 koban gold ryb. However, despite this, the attempt to build a new Main Hall failed mis- erably. In 1694, Zenkbji officials secured a site for the new hall north of the exist- ing temporary hall, and three years later they began building it. In 1700, during construction, a massive fire broke out in the front district of the temple. It con- sumed almost all of the temple buildings as well as the piles of lumber that were to be used for the construction of a new Main Hall (MCCALLUM 1994,171). Luckily, in 1700, the newly installed leaders (Keiun 1- of Daikanjin kQ A and Chizen of Daihongan cMi.) of Zenk6ji were related to Yanagi- sawa Yoshiyasu ORI- - i (1658-1714), Sh6gun Tsunayoshi's right-hand man in the bakufu (Keiun was his nephew and Chizen was his daughter). Thus, they were able to secure a permit from the bakufu and to launch an all-around-the- 1. One koban gold ryd was worth about 1 koku of rice (1 koku = 180.39 liters). 46</page><page sequence="3">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 47 country kaich6 in 1701.2 During this nationwide fundraising campaign, Keiun exercised strong leadership, and this eventually led to the successful construc- tion of Zenk6ji's towering Main Hall. Kaich6 events, which, in theory, were designed to provide people with spe- cial opportunities for worship in the context of Buddhist merit-making, were used mainly for fundraising purposes. Whenever possible, the Zenk6ji admin- istration made good use of kaicho events to raise funds for building and other major projects. The bakufu and local domains, which were finding it increas- ingly difficult to provide funding to temples, began to allow the latter to collect "clean monies" from their lay followers. This system was known as kange ftL (exhortation of Buddha's teachings), and it enabled Buddhist temples to solicit donations directly from the populace by holding a kaich6 or even by demanding specific donations from a given area or region. This type of fundraising, which posed an extra burden upon the public, was subject to the approval of the gov- ernment. For example, when a temple wanted to hold a kaich6 in Edo, Osaka, or Kyoto, it had to appeal to the bakufu's Magistrate of Temples and Shrines, who, through permission-granting procedures, would try to regulate the frequency and duration of a kaich6. Bakufu officials tried to ensure that temples did not depend too heavily on these events for their finances. In Edo, the government tried to grant only five permits per season and to limit exhibitions to sixty days per permit. Furthermore, the bakufu stipulated that an institution could hold a regular kaich6 only at thirty-three-year intervals. In practice, however, these policies did not mean much. It was not uncommon for a kaich6 to last sixty to eighty days, and there were often five to ten simultaneous "exhibitions" occur- ring at any given time.3 It seemed to be quite easy to persuade bakufu officials to grant "special" permission to prominent temples to hold special kaich6 events.4 As a matter of fact, the bakufu's leniency toward special kaich6 events was not entirely incompatible with its own interests. As Hiruma Hisashi points out, the bakufu's policy toward kaich6 was related to its attempts to deal with its own financial woes. Due to fiscal constraints, the bakufu found it increasingly difficult 2. Since Zenk6ji had successfully completed a special kaicho only six years previously, it was not easy for it to obtain permission for another special kaich6 so soon. Permission for a special kaich6 involving multiple domains and jurisdictions was especially hard to get because the final decision had to come from the Shogun through the mediation of state elders. And this was far beyond the level of the Magistrate of Temples and Shrines. The lobby of Daikanjin and Daihon- gan, who had blood connections with Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, was a decisive factor in Zenkoji's ability to secure permission from the bakufu.

Instead, it allowed them to raise funds through kaicho events or other forms of direct, albeit decorous, public solicitation (HIRUMA 1973, 24-26). The Zenk6ji administration was quite successful in persuading the bakufu to permit it to hold special kaicho events in the Santo and along Japan's major travel routes. Among Zenk6ji's special kaicho events, the most successful was the all-around-the-country kaicho of 1701 to 1706, which eventually enabled it to rebuild its Main Hall. Lay Buddhists who responded to this special kaicho event transformed Zenk6ji into one of the most prominent religious fundraisers in early modern Japan. What led to people's religious interests and the kaichd enter- prise being so seamlessly fused? The cultural context of kaicho poses a puzzle. By exploring some specific examples of Zenkoji's kaicho events, this article reveals that the religious worship and economic enterprise that merged so spectacularly during these events were grounded in Japan's distinctive religious culture. The Kaichi of Zenk-ji Kaich6, or"opening of a curtain"' refers to the special public exhibition of a hibutsu tML (secret Buddha) which is otherwise enshrined in a sealed receptacle and kept "secret" behind its "curtain." A kaich6 is therefore a special religious event that provides an opportunity for worshippers to come face to face with a secret Bud- dha and to appeal directly to its compassion. A kaich6 could be held either at the home temple (ikaich6 ku R ) or at an outside temple (degaich6o 1 0). If it were held at the latter, this entailed moving the sealed receptacle from its home temple. The kaich6 held at the home temple of Zenk6ji was called goek6 *P 0 [A (trans- ference of Buddhist merit). During the Edo period, Zenkoji conducted sixteen goek6 events: the first was held in 1730 and the last was held in 1865. The intervals between these events did not follow any particular schedule. There were three basic reasons (sometimes occurring separately, sometimes in combination) for holding them: (1) the completion of continuous major multi-year devotional rituals involving diurnal and nocturnal nenbutsu-chanting (1730, 1762,1773,1785, 1799, 1811, 1821, 1832, 1847, 1865); (2) the completion of a major degaich6 (1742, 1799, 1804, 1811); and (3) the completion of major construction or repair projects involving the Main Hall, entrance gates, roofs, or the canon storage area (1745, 1759, 1791, 1832, 1840, 1865) (KOBAYASHI 1973, 153-55). There were two categories of degaichi: (1) Santo (tri-city) kaich6 and (2) kai- koku (all-around-the-country) kaich6. In the case of the former, the format was fixed: it was first held in Edo and then moved to Kyoto and Osaka in the follow- ing year or the year after. Altogether, there were three Santo kaichi during the Edo period (1692-1694, 1740-1741, and 1778-1780), and the levels of income from these events reflected the changing economic strengths of the three</page><page sequence="5">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 49 cities.5 The kaikoku kaich6, which were held four times during the Edo period (1701-1706, 1745-1748, 1780-1782, and 1794-1798), required a large amount of preparatory work, and were very expensive, proved to be quite lucrative.6 In the kaikoku kaich6, the duration of hibutsu exhibitions in a given place did not usu- ally exceed five days. What is Kaich6 for? In 1829, the subtemple (jinai #'IJ) and residents (monzen P9Hif) who lived in front of it petitioned the Zenk6ji administration, which, at that time, was plan- ning to hold a kaikoku kaicho. Over the past few years, the economy has been in bad shape. All merchant fam- ilies are hard pressed for money and their businesses have not prospered. Due to this, some families in trouble even sell their wives and children as prostitutes or abandon their old parents and run away to Edo.... We earnestly ask that a goek6 of the Nyorai be held next year. If so, money will pour in from other provinces, and the residents will naturally be stabilized and people's minds will calm down. (KOBAYASHI 1973,156) Daikanjin K6d6 A , the top administrator of Zenk6ji, accepted the petition, and he soon abandoned his plan to hold a degaich6. In its stead, a kaich6 at the home temple was held in 1832, and the "bad" economic situation of the Zenk6ji community was considerably improved. In 1835, however, K6jun 5',Ui was newly installed as Daikanjin and announced another plan to conduct a massive kaikoku kaich6, the aim being to kick-start his tenure with considerable fanfare. The residents of subtemples immediately appealed to Kojun. Here, again, we see clearly how kaich6 events were intricately entwined with the Zenkoji economy. The people of subtemples (jichfi #4P) are very poorly paid. In ordinary times, they run inns for the visitors' guides, and conduct, through the mediation of those guides, merit-making rituals for the ancestors and parents [of lay wor- shippers] through the mediation of these guides, or offer rites of Buddhist lin- eage connection (kechimyaku Ift) [for lay worshippers]. They make a living by conducting services like these, which generate income. If a kaikoku kaich6 is conducted, all those merit-making rituals, rites of Buddhist karmic connec- tion, goinmon fPa~[IZ (stamping the seal), and so forth will be moved away 5. In 1803 and 1820, respectively, a Santo kaich6 was planned, but it was limited to Edo due to the need to shorten the time the hibutsu was away from home. 6.

For which items were carried, displayed, and transacted at a degaich6, see AMBROS 2004,10-17.</page><page sequence="6">50 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 36/1 (2009) from the home temple. If that happens, the people of subtemples will not be able to survive. (KOBAYASHI 1973,156-57) The "front-district" residents delivered a similar petition to the head monk, asking that the Nyorai not be taken away from the Main Hall for a degaicho event. The petitioners even threatened to use force to ensure that this did not happen. Clearly, tensions ran high. The Zenk6ji front-district residents, who depended upon the temple economy, argued that even the temporary absence of its central object of worship-the Nyorai-would increase their economic woes. They insisted that their best shot at reviving the distressed economy would be to hold a kaichO at home as that would get "monies pouring in from other provinces." For them, the kaichO was simply a means of attracting customers. Similarly, the subtemple residents-that is, the managers of and workers at subtemple lodges and religious halls-argued that their livelihood, too, was dependent upon external worshippers who visited the Zenk6ji Nyorai and, in particular, upon their guides, who channeled Zenkoji followers to Zenkoji rituals and worship activities (KOBAYASHI 1973, 120-21). As far as those who made a living in the Zenk6ji community (including monks, workers, merchants, and temple personnel) were concerned, more than anything else, the kaicho meant an opportunity for financial gain or loss. In 1835, under mounting pressure from all sides, a group of temple officials submitted the following letter to Daikanjin Kojun: If you proceed to go ahead with your plan of kaikoku [kaich6] at a time like this, it would certainly invite a great disturbance. In such a case, some 4,000 or 5,000 people in the temple land would start a riot and it would be beyond what the temple monks could possibly handle. There are so many people who rely for a living upon outside visitors of worship for a living, along the entering routes leading to Zenk6ji. So nobody knows what kind of trouble is going to happen [if you insist on the kaikoku kaich6]. (KOBAYASHI 1973,157) The threat was real. In distress, Kojun gave up his plan, using the excuse that the disease in his leg would not allow him to travel. Three years later, he resigned from his position. For Zenk6ji worshippers, however, kaichO was primarily a reli- gious event. When a kaich6 was held, laypeople visited the temple to worship and view the secret Buddha, which was normally hidden from the public gaze. When visitors attended a kaich6, they would customarily pay an admission fee at the entrance and toss an offering, usually consisting of coins, into the offertory box set up at the display site. But the core of their activity involved face-to-face worship of the kaicho deity.7 After having engaged in worship and prayer activi- 7. For the temple holding the kaich6, numerous small donations in the form of entrance fees and offertory coins usually proved to be far more lucrative than did the few large donations that</page><page sequence="7">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 51 ties, visitors usually proceed to enjoy the kaicho as a recreational opportunity, a diversion from their daily routines. Not surprisingly, when a kaicho was held, its temple site was quickly transformed into a bustling market and place of enter- tainment, where all kinds of sellers and street performers catered to visitors. Questions about Kaicho The kaichb exhibition, which prospered from the early modern period, is an idiosyncratic Buddhist cultural event most commonly found in Japan. Kaich5 is certainly inseparable from Buddhism; however, interestingly, it betrays the very spirit of Buddhism. We cannot find any Buddhist scripture that suggests that the image of a Buddhist deity can be locked up in a feretory and kept from pub- lic view. It appears even more antithetical to Buddhist teachings to suggest that the doors of that feretory can occasionally be opened and that the iconic image within can be put on display for the purpose of financial gains.8 In other words, the kaich6 is premised on the notion that a special type of Buddhist compassion, exercised by the kaicho deity on special occasions, is extendable only to those worshippers who can afford entrance fees or who can make financial contribu- tions to the deity's home temple. In the kaich6 setting, Buddhist compassion is turned into an object of financial transaction. So far, with regard to kaicho events, scholars of Tokugawa religion have looked at administrative procedures, preparations, advertisements, the setting up of facilities, the collection of entrance fees and offerings, the functions of temple personnel and confraternity members, and markets and entertainment activities. Much attention has also been paid to the social infrastructure of kaich6 events as they relate to travel, transportation, and the economy.9 Questions that remain less explored are: What is the origin of the idea of secrecy attached to the kaich6 Buddha? How was the secrecy surrounding a Buddhist image nurtured and manipulated? How was the divinity of a secret Buddha associated with and represented by its iconic image? We also need to pay attention to the fact that a kaicho was held only on scheduled dates and that visitors attached special meaning to their face-to-face worship of kaich6 deities. it collected at other times. For their part, kaich6 visitors found this type of offering, which could be made without their being hampered by formality, time constraints, or congestion, to be the simplest and most convenient. 8.

The most commonly known version goes like this: In ancient India there was a wealthy man named Gakkai A), who had a beautiful daughter named Nyoze MA. Nyoze died sud- denly but was resurrected thanks to the intercession of Amida Buddha. Out of gratitude, Gakkai sculpted an image representing the Amida Triad and vener- ated it. Nearly one thousand years later, the story evolved into a scene in Paekche, an ancient kingdom on the Korean peninsula, where Gakkai was reincarnated as King S6ngmy6ng 59H and the Amida Triad flew to preach to him the way of compassion. Another time, the Amida Triad traveled to Japan, where Gakkai and King S6ngmy6ng were now reincarnated as Honda Yoshimitsu 4:BZl (his first name is read as "Zenk6"), who would bring the Triad to Shinano, enshrine it in a newly built temple, and venerate it. But Yoshimitsu soon encountered a tragedy. His son Honda Yoshisuke ZBFHI and his wife Yayoi 3i suddenly died and fell to the other world, where they suffered agonies. Through the com- passionate power of the Triad, they were saved from hell and ensured rebirth in paradise. Upon hearing this, Empress K6gyoku (r. 642-645) awarded father and son with governorships and provided them with funds to build a grand temple named Zenkoji to house the Triad. Here we see the constant themes of the Zenkoji engi 4 (Zenk6ji chronology)--death, the other world, and rebirth-all of which find expression in the salvific power of the Zenk6ji Amida. As Gakkai, Nyoze, King S6ngmy6ng, and the Honda family all experienced, the Zenk6ji Amida was able to rescue the dead from hell and to ensure their rebirth in paradise. Over time, due to its miraculous compassion, which transcended both time and space, the ZenkOji Amida came to be seen as a living Buddha who could maintain the warmth of the body, speak, write, and sing hymns (YAMANOI 1987, 238). People believed that, as the saviour of dead spirits who were suffering in hell, the Zenkoji Amida could reach anyone at any time and in any place. But the Zenkoji Amida was soon made into a "secret Buddha" (hibutsu), and worshippers were expected to use the occasion of kaich6 to gain direct access to its compassion. Legend has it that, in 645, Emperor KOtoku (r. 645-654) ordered the Zenkoji Triad images to be kept away from public view. The following year, Honda Yoshimitsu sculpted and erected a "front-standing" replica of the original Triad images and sealed the originals away in a locked feretory (YAMANOI 1995, 114). As far as history goes, it is known that, at least from the thirteenth century to the present, only one person has seen the original Zenkbji Triad. This occurred</page><page sequence="9">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 53 in 1702, when the rumor that the Zenk6ji Triad had been stolen shook the foun- dation of Zenk6ji worship. Deeply concerned, and in an attempt to quash the damaging gossip, the Rinn6ji monzeki w (who oversaw the Zenk6ji institution) dispatched a deputy monk, Genryfiin Keitan M&amp;E~WA, to Zenk6ji to inspect the secret Triad images. Keitan ascertained, with his own eyes, that the Zenk6ji Triad was indeed well preserved in the sealed receptacle (KOBAYASHI 1973, 33-36). The original Zenkoji Triad was never shown, even on the occasion of a kaicho, which was supposed to "open up the curtain." As was the case at many other kaicho temples, so it was at Zenkoji: the kaich6 event never actually featured the exhibition of the original Triad images. Instead, a replica of them-a set of bronze-gilt images known as Maedachi Sanzon l5_ti -0 (the Triad that Stands in Front)--was put out for display and served as the locus of worship. The original Triad, which permanently vanished from public sight, still dwells in secrecy behind the curtain. Nevertheless, the Maedachi Sanzon of Zenk6ji provided viewers with an awe- inspiring presence. The central figure is the Amida Buddha. It stands on a pedes- tal, is approximately forty-three centimetres tall, and is the focal point of popular worship and prayer. The worshippers have neither doubted the authenticity of this replica nor questioned the veracity of its genesis. The mysterious aura of the original Triad, explicated in a variety of Zenk6ji chronicles, has been somehow transplanted into the Maedachi Sanzon. The latter has, without fail, fulfilled the function of the former on the occasions of kaicho, even though it is not clear how the replica could be equated with the original.10 Kami in the Kaich6 Buddha What made lay Buddhists uphold the secrecy of kaicho Buddhas? Why did kaicho visitors believe that the secret Buddhas released special salvific grace on the occasion of public display? How did this secret Zenk6ji Triad become so popular throughout the country? Stories about the miraculous power of kaicho Buddhas were abundant, and they caught people's attention and attracted visitors to the kaicho sites. For exam- ple, the widely circulated Zenk6ji chronicles, boasting more than eighty-five ver- sions from the Nara period (710-784) to the Taisho era (1912-1926), promoted the extraordinary compassion of the Zenk6ji Triad to a nationwide audience (YAMANOI 1995, 115-16). In addition, one-page paintings featuring the Zenkoji Triad in various sizes and colors catered to the religious curiosity of laypeople 10. On the question of how the copies succeeded in functioning as the original, McCAL- LUM (1998, 213-14) suggests that "there is some ambiguity in the conceptualization of the prime object/replication relationship, a vagueness that was perhaps purposely designed to direct atten- tion away from the somewhat problematic status of the copies."</page><page sequence="10">54 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 36/1 (2009) throughout the country. These paintings, which were available at an affordable price during a kaich6, were particularly popular. In 1799, when a kaich6 was held at ZenkAji, more than 200,ooo copies of this sort of single-piece painting were sold at the Main Hall alone (KOBAYASHI 1973,155). The Zenkoji Triad, which was better known as the Zenkoji Amida, generated a fever of worship throughout the country in the early modern period, thanks particularly to peripatetic proselytizers known as ZenkOji hijiri %t-r0, who carried a replica of the Zenkoji Amida on their backs. The proselytizing activi- ties of the traveling Zenk6ji hijiri, who were associated with subtemples or lodg- ing facilities in the Zenk6ji complex, were critical in elevating the sacred aura of the secret Zenkoji Amida. Furthermore, the Zenk6ji hijiri were instrumental in establishing branch temples of Zenkoji; they made copies of the Zenk6ji Triad and established or helped to build temples for enshrining them, all of which were to be named Shin Zenkoji or, simply, Zenk6ji. Currently, there are over one hun- dred branch temples carrying the name of Zenkoji or Shin Zenk6ji, and these function as the local hubs of a nationwide Zenk6ji cult.11 In addition, unlike other temples, Zenkoji did not have danna *[M (temple patrons) who were exclusively associated with it. In other words, Zenkoji dif- fered from other temples, which were primarily devoted to serving their local patrons. The Zenk6ji hijiri only loosely maintained their "territories of right" (known as kasumi ~i) for local Zenkoji believers. As a matter of fact, during the Edo period, Zenk6ji maintained the system of kasumi territories (which were also called mochig6ri ~I5 [possession of counties]), in which the country's counties were divided into thirty-nine groups that corresponded to its thirty- nine subtemples. Each of these subtemples had its own accommodations and was associated with its own sendatsu 'ic (guides) and proselytizers. As these religious affiliates of Zenk6ji subtemples also worked for other local temples and religious halls, it follows that the local patrons of Zenk6ji subtemples were free to pursue religious activities not related to Zenk6ji. Without maintaining any exclusive claim to patronage, the Zenkoji Amida was open to anyone, regardless of sectarian affiliation, gender, or age. Indeed, the popularity of Zenkoji kaich6 spread across the country. In par- ticular, the degaicho, which provided local people with a rare opportunity for a face-to-face encounter with the renowned Zenk6ji Amida, delivered a power- ful message of universal salvation. The degaich6 booth, which was set up along the kaicho route, was a miniature of Zenkoji's Main Hall. The multiple curtains that enveloped its secret Buddha were open, facing the worshippers; the spatial ii. According to MCCALLUM'S (1994, 89) study, the distribution of Zenk6ji, or Shin ZenkOji, is nationwide, with only K6chi, Nagasaki, Saga, and Okinawa Prefectures lacking traces of Zenk6ji establishments.</page><page sequence="11">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 55 arrangements of the altar replicated the sacred geography of Zenk6ji; and all necessary offertory boxes and entrance gates were in place. The degaich6 booth, with the Amida Triad at its center, was a mobile entrance to the other world, or the Western Paradise, transplanted from Shinano (NAGANOKEN 1982, 715). At this sacred entrance, which was guarded by the Amida Buddha, worshippers were able to pray directly to the Living Buddha of Zenk6ji Amida for rebirth in Paradise-as long as they could pay an entrance fee, of course. Needless to say, for the Zenk6ji administration, the Zenkoji Amida, which was enormously popular and carefully moved along the heavily populated routes of the country, offered tremendous opportunities for public fundraising. But no matter how popular or how appealing it might be, the original Zenk6ji Amida remained strictly out of the public view. Its ultimate mystery was commu- nicated only by proxy, through the Maedachi image. For their part, worshippers paid attention to the compassion of the Zenkoji Amida when it was on "display," despite the fact that the motivating force behind kaich6 ran counter to Buddhist teachings. They believed that the original Zenkoji Amida's "secret" divinity was present in the image on exhibition, thus enabling them to connect with it directly through an act of worship or prayer. In fact, the structure of worship at a kaich6 resembled that at a Shinto shrine, in which visitors stood in front of the ritual hall (haiden IT ) and prayed toward the deity that was present in the Main Hall (honden 44R) or the inner hall (okumiya -A ). Traditionally, when a ritual of worship or prayer was conducted on a scheduled date, the Japanese believed that the deity in question came down from its unknown residence and manifested itself in the Main Hall. The secrecy of a kaich6 Buddha is grounded in the psychic structure of worship, which itself is steeped in indigenous religious ideas and practices. Yamaori Tet- suo has examined the Shunie fII_ ritual (also known as the Omizudori 3A.KIU B ritual) held at T6daiji Nigatsud6o -R and featuring the procession of the two secret Kannon images (the hibutsu of T6daiji) enshrined in the Naijin (inner hall) to the Reidi (worship hall) and then back to the Naijin. He suggests that the whole structure of the ritual for the Kannon hibutsu resembles the procession format of a portable shrine (mikoshi *W..) in the matsuri (1J, Shinto festivals), which moves from the Main Hall (honden *MR) to a temporary lodge (otabisho -nfi)T) and then back to the Main Hall (YAMAORI 1987, 169-72). The matsuri is premised on the belief that the deity is invited to the lodging place (yorishiro W&amp;,t) of a portable shrine and that the latter is then carried and temporarily installed in the gotabisho, where local parishioners can pay homage to their tutelary deity. As the Todaiji's Shunie ritual indicates, the divinity of a kaichd Buddha is kami-like: it is invisible, divisible, and amorphous, dwelling behind a veil of secrecy, yet it is associated with a specific hidden Buddhist image of which it is the temporary manifestation. Thus, while being a supernatural being, the kaicho</page><page sequence="12">56 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 36/1 (2009) Buddha is also endowed with a certain physicality. When the hidden Buddhist image is temporarily incarnated in its iconic representation--that is, on the occasion of its kaicho-worshippers are delighted by the prospect of connecting with it directly. The Kaichi Buddha and Yorishiro Despite the kami-like traits of secret Buddhas, it should be noted that worship activities in the kaichd were not directed toward an abstract divinity but, rather, toward a specific Buddhist deity that was incarnated in a specific image. Another famed kaichO deity in early modern Japan, the Asakusa Kannon of Edo's Sens6ji Temple, is exemplary of this phenomenon. The Asakusa Kannon refers to a small golden image of the Bodhisattva Avalokite'vara (Kannon), which was allegedly found by two fishermen in the Sumida River in 628. This tiny Kannon image, enshrined in a house that became the future Sensoji Temple, was later kept out of public sight and made "secret'." Since then, this image has elicited enormous religious veneration throughout the country (HUR 2000, 5-10). However, this particular Kannon image was not the only such image enshrined at Sensoji. In the Edo period, for example, the Sensaji precincts contained five other minor Kannon halls, all of which enshrined Kan- non images of various sizes and shapes. Furthermore, flanking the Asakusa Kannon image in the Main Hall were six additional Kannon images positioned shoulder to shoulder (MATSUDAIRA 1939, 53-63). However, in terms of religious efficacy, none of these was considered comparable to the tiny Asakusa Kannon image. Buddhist doctrine makes no mention of a deity's efficacy or salvific power being dependent upon the size or shape of its image. In fact, it makes no mention of a deity's needing to be represented by an image at all. Nevertheless, images were the primary source of religious veneration and worship. And some of them were given particular prominence, as may be seen in the Zenkoji Amida. The extraordinary power of the Zenkoji Amida image, whose reputation exceeded that of all the other Amida images to be found at Zenk6ji as well as throughout the country, had little to do with Buddhist doctrine. Indeed, its secret nature was contrary to Buddhist teachings pertaining to universal salvation. Throughout its history, Zenkoji has been struck by several disastrous fires; yet it is claimed that its original Amida image somehow mysteriously survived. However, in the late sixteenth century, it was taken from the temple and kept temporarily at different places until finally being returned to Zenkdji (OKUNO 1986, o106). Interestingly, the issue of whether the original image had been lost, or possibly replaced with a new one, did not seem to trouble the believers, who prayed to their "ever-present" icons at Zenkbji. As Donald MCCALLUM (1994,</page><page sequence="13">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 57 166) suggests,"what really traveled around was a concept, the concept of the'Liv- ing Buddha' who could offer salvation to believers." This concept of the "Living Buddha" (shojin nyorai - M), which served as the agent of miracles and sal- vation, was graphically revealed in the secret image of the Amida at Zenkoji. Zenk6ji was the site of a cult whose concern was a specific image of the Zenkoji Amida-an image that was imbued with the power to perform miracles-not the abstract, universal divinity of the Buddha Amitabha. Why did the Japanese people pay so much attention to and venerate these images? The religious icon can be viewed as a representation of the deity, a sym- bol of the deity, or the deity itself, but none of these interpretations fully explains why, with regard to the same deity, certain icons attract such strong religious piety while others do not.12 Needless to say, there were hundreds of thousands of icons representing the Buddha Amida, but they did not all have equal religious efficacy or powers of salvation. Only a few were singled out to enjoy nationwide religious veneration, and the Zenk6ji Amida image topped them all. So from where did the religious power of the Zenkoji Amida come? In order to understand this, we need to pay attention to Japanese ideas regard- ing a deity's manifestation, which requires a specific yorishiro W1, or lodging place. Traditionally, the Japanese people believed that a deity's religious efficacy was most effective when it was invited into a specific lodging place and was wor- shipped there directly. The term yorishiro, also known as tamashiro a-eR, yori- mashi WIA, or kamishiro 4~l, refers to a specific distinctive object into which a deity is invited to enter to receive worship (NISHIMURA 1985, 45-55). The most archaic forms of yorishiro were rocks, trees, plants, or other natu- ral objects, which were usually cordoned off from their surroundings. During religious ceremonies, the deity in question would be invoked and would mani- fest itself in a specific yorishiro object, and then people would worship it. Over time, permanent structures for honoring deities were built, and the yorishiro was placed at the altar of the inner space of those structures. Eventually, the yorishiro 12. The icon as a representation of the Buddha, for example, refers to various anthropomor- phic depictions of it, whether as part or whole. As such, it provides the worshiper with a sense of direct access to the Buddhist deity. The icon is "a symbolic substitute for the deity," which cannot be represented in physical form due to its transcendent nature, and, for the worshipper, "can serve as a direct stimulus and as an aid to meditation." On the other hand, the icon refers to the object in which the deity is incarnated, an idea that suggests that the deity has become the icon. Among these possibilities, MCCALLUM (1994, 181-82) believes that the last interpretation "delineates the situation of the Zenk6ji Amida Triad"-the image as "an exact representation of the deity" as a Living Buddha-even though he admits that "these three categories can and do overlap, and of course, a single icon can be interpreted in terms of different conceptualizations at various times or by diverse individuals." But this interpretation still does not fully explain the intrinsic traits of kaich6 as prescribed by the factors of time and space and that affect the reli- gious faculties of the deity involved.</page><page sequence="14">58 Japanese lournal of Religious Studies 36/1 (2009) took the form of a shintai $1t, or "deity-body," which was often represented by such objects as a sword, a spear, a mirror, or curved jewels. All these deity-bodies, sealed in a container or placed on a stand, were hidden from public sight and kept in the inner hall. Without a yorishiro, or shintai, a deity could neither be invoked nor directly worshipped. For this reason, when a matsuri was held in the community, the parishioners made yorishiro objects such as a pine tree, a bamboo basket, an umbrella, a spear, or a float, and they performedfuiryia JA iE (entertainment) to welcome the entry of their tutelary deity into the yorishiro in question. Under Buddhist influence stemming from the Nara period, some shrines installed anthropomorphic images or portraits (shinz6b T$) of dei- ties, which were also understood as yorishiro (HUR 2000, 5). It was commonly believed that deities that maintained permanent dwellings far away came down to these yorishiro objects when invoked for purposes of worship. It follows that most rituals involved a three-part procedure: (1) inviting a deity to a specific yorishiro, (2) worshipping it, and (3) sending it back to its per- manent residence (SUEKI 1989, 37-38). When anthropomorphic Buddhist statues were introduced, the Japanese understood them less as visual representations of Buddhist deities and more as particular places within which those deities were lodged when called upon. Through stories, symbols, politics, and an appreciation of cosmological wonders, generations of Japanese people created layers of reli- gious meaning around these yorishiro representations (ITO 1983, 175-226). Seen from within this tradition, the Zenkoji Amida may simply have been a special- indeed, probably the most prominent-yorishiro into which the compassionate divinity of the Buddha Amitabha entered and manifested (suijaku MA_) itself. The Zenkoji divinity of the Buddha Amitabha was believed to reveal itself and to offer compassion to its worshippers when they contacted it directly by worship- ping at its yorishiro. Kaicho Dates and Saijitsu For Zenkoji worshippers, the Buddha Amida portrayed in the Buddhist scrip- tures remained an abstract, remote, and amorphous deity. On the occasion of a kaich6, the divinity of the Buddha Amida was transformed into a Living Buddha specific to Zenk6ji, and the revelation of the latter was represented by the clan- destine "lodging place" of the Zenkoji Triad, which was opened to the public. Traditionally, the Japanese believed that a deity would most strongly exercise its divine power if it were worshipped at a designated lodging place and at a designated time. By securing direct contact with a deity at a specific time, the Japanese believed that they could establish a personal salvific connection with it-a karmic connection that would allow them to accumulate special religious merit and thereby be ushered into the world of the deity's miraculous power. In</page><page sequence="15">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 59 doctrinal Buddhism, on the other hand, any day on which one worships a Bud- dhist deity is one's ennichi ~E, or "connection day" In other words, the religious merit gained by worshipping should not vary according to date. Despite this, as we have seen, Buddhist preachers promoted the idea that if one were to wor- ship a Buddhist deity on a special date and in a direct manner, then one would acquire far greater religious merit than would be the case on an ordinary day. In the case of Zenk6ji, temple officials emphasized that, by worshipping the Zenk6ji Amida on the seventh to fifteenth day of the first month for goinmon fa -l 7C (which refers to receiving on one's forehead a vermilion stamp representing the Zenkoji seal) and on the anniversary (Goeshiki 40:A) of the day on which the Zenkoji Triad had been moved to the current site (the fifteenth day of the third month), one could double and even triple the religious merit that could be gained on an ordinary day. The idea of enhancing one's religious merit reached its high- est point at the time of a kaich6: one could attain hundreds or thousands of times more merit with a single act of worship than could be attained on a non-kaich6 day. The idea of special dates for merit-making was compatible with what occurs on a Shinto worship day, which is referred to as saijitsu BH (ritual date)-a day when the deity is invited to its temporary lodging place, worshipped, and then sent back to its permanent residence.13 Preparation for greeting the saijitsu usu- ally began the day before, with an okomori 1L) (confining oneself in a closed space), which involved worshippers being sequestered in a shrine for an entire night."4 This ritual conduct was designed to greet the descent of the deity to its "lodging place" or "deity-body," the premise being that worshipping such a deity required a tangible space, time, and object. All these ideas combined to produce a culture of kaich6, which featured the scheduled public exhibition of a deity who had descended to its closeted yorishiro. The blossoming of kaich6 culture, fostered by Japan's traditional ideas of yori- shiro and saijitsu, had no parallel in the Buddhist world. Some records suggest that the divine body of a deity was kept away from the public gaze and used for a kaich6 in China. Nonetheless, as far as we know, this happened only on a few occa- sions and never developed into a religious fashion of the kind seen in Japan.'5 In contrast, in early modern Japan, which was blessed with hundreds of secret Bud- dhas, kaich6 events were innumerable and lucrative. Any time a famous secret 13. In Shinto, on the occasion of a matsuri, a deity was believed to descend to its shintai (for example, a mirror, a rock, a sword, a bell, or a comma-shaped bead), which was encased in the inner space of the main hall. For more details, see ONO 1963, 209-10. 14. For a detailed discussion of saijitsu, see YANAGITA 1963,"Saijitsu k6." 15. In T'ang China, the term k'ai-chang (J. kaich6) was used to refer to the display of a Bud- dhist relic-allegedly one of the finger bones of SAkyamuni. See FOWLER (1991-1992, 137-38). Some dharani Buddhist texts cite examples of secret images, but their citations are brief and almost meaningless. For details, see FOWLER 1991-1992, 139.</page><page sequence="16">60 Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 36/1 (2009) Buddha was supposed to manifest itself at a kaich6, people eagerly anticipated making face-to-face contact with it and appealing directly to its compassion. Degaicho and Marebito The beginning of a kaicho, which featured the opening of the Amida receptacle curtains, was an occasion for dramatizing the manifestation of the secret Zenk6ji Amida through the notion of descent. In particular, when a degaichd was held at a location removed from the home altar, the descent of the Zenkoji Amida represented the manifestation of the Buddha Amida, who had traveled all the way from the beyond. The path of this secret deity was twofold: (1) from India through the Paekche Kingdom on the Korean peninsula, in what was known as Sangoku denrai -31 fi (Three Kingdom Transmission), and (2) from Shinano. The story of the Zenk6ji Amida's visit from the continent as well as from Shi- nano was compelling, and it moved local worshippers. At the degaicho event, the Sankoku denrai legend, which overlapped with the visit of the Amida from Shinano, reinforced the popular belief that the Zenkoji Amida was a deity from the other world who visited in order to save worshippers from suffering in this world. For local worshippers, the descent of the Zenk6ji Amida from a distant realm resonated with the traditional idea of marebito 71- lE: (visitor-deity). According to folk beliefs, the marebito referred to a deity who visited the village from tokoyo 'tA on a regular basis, usually annually, in order to bring blessings (and warnings) and good harvests to the villagers. Although the tokoyo originally denoted a realm beyond this world, or the other-world of the dead, it gradually came to include the sea, heaven, or a vast mountain where ancestral spirits were believed to dwell.'When a marebito visited the village, often in the guise of an old man with a long white beard or as a young child, the vil- lagers greeted it with a matsuri and prayed for good harvests (ORIKUCHI 1964, 3-5; KOMATSU 1985, 39-43; SUWA 1992, 47-48). For kaicho viewers, the Zenkoji Amida was a very powerful and miraculous marebito. The concept of marebito, then, provided another layer of sacred meaning to the Zenk6ji Amida while the latter was on tour. As the FusO ryakki describes it, the Zenkoji Amida arrived from beyond the sea-a realm of tokoyo. Its transmis- sion from tokoyo over the sea thus corresponds with religious folk beliefs regard- ing visitor-deities (YAMANOI 1987, 245-46).16 In this context, Gorai Shigeru even 16. It6 Yuishin suggests that the ancient Japanese regarded deities from abroad, including Buddhas and bodhisattvas, as marebito. The names of these deities as found in ancient records are various (for example, dait6 no kami IF J* [deities of Great T'ang] in the Fus6 ryakki; ada- shikuni no kami *f4l [barbarian deities] in the Nihon shoki I1HZ: ; takokushin I~1fl* [deities of foreign countries] in the Gang6ji engi jFc EF_,; and marddo no gami K$* [visitor-deities] in the Nihon rydiki El ), but their divine powers were almost identical. See ITo 1983,177-80.</page><page sequence="17">HUR: SECRET BUDDHA OF ZENKOJI 61 suggests that the Zenkoji Amida Triad "returned to Japan" and that, through the event of degaicho, the Triad kept returning to the villages of Japan from Shinano, a remote Japanese holy place (GORAI 1988, 68-69). Conclusion During the Edo period, the kaich3 at Zenkoji was embedded within layers of beliefs and practices rooted in traditional religious culture. The religiosity of the early modern Japanese, which was not necessarily bound to a particular locality or sectarian affiliation, ensured the prosperity of many temples that were blessed with owning unusual secret Buddhas. The nationwide Zenkoji cult, which was most dramatically demonstrated on the occasion of kaicho events, reinforced the belief that the Zenk6ji Amida offered an entrance to the Western Paradise. At the site of Zenkoji, on the occasion of a kaichd, worshippers appealed to the manifestation of the Buddha Amida and secured their salvific connection with the divine compassion of the Living Buddha of Zenk6ji Amida. In doing so, they also ensured salvation for themselves and their loved ones in the other world. In this tradition, many families sent the teeth or hair of the deceased to Zenkoji and enshrined them at its charnel house, honoring the long-held cus- tom of"depositing ashes;" or nokotsu ,LMt'. Those who could not afford to make a trip to Shinano enthusiastically greeted the Zenk6ji Amida on a degaicho tour. The sacred seat of the Zenkoji Amida was mobile, and its mobility catered to the religious customs of local worshippers. For Zenk6ji officials and associates as well as monzen merchants, the kaicho offered an economic opportunity. In particular, given that building mainte- nance was a major financial challenge and that government support for Bud- dhist temples was very limited, Zenk6ji officials realized that kaicho offered a very tempting solution to their financial problems. For most temples, building repairs became a private task to be addressed through recourse to landed prop- erty, danna patrons, public fundraising, and other business operations. As far as Zenk6ji was concerned, kaicho events proved to be the most effective method of fundraising. The upkeep of the magnificent national treasure that is Zenkoji's Main Hall has owed much to the fusion of beliefs and practices intrinsic to tradi- tional Japanese religious belief.
