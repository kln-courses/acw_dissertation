<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 82  BOOK REVIEWS Danto finds renewed urgency for this project in (what was then) the recent news of the Pearl City  massacre, an atrocity committed by teenagers inspired by their reading of Nietzsche. Danto asserts  that Nietzsche must be interpreted in such a way that he comes out defanged, and he outlines the  twofold strategy he used in  Nietzsche as Philosopher “to circle the enemy.” On the one hand,  Danto writes, he sought to bring Nietzsche into conversation with the most traditional questions  and figures of the Western tradition and so re-create him as an armchair philosopher in their mold.  (Presumably, this would make him boring to future potential teenage mass murderers, who will  have to go elsewhere for inspiration.) And on the other hand, Danto sought to turn Nietzsche’s  hypercritical challenges to other forms of meaning-making back on himself, in order then to leave  his views as tattered as he left those of the tradition.  D anto recognizes, now, that a third strategy might do the same trick: treat Nietzsche’s works  as literary. “Poetry,” he cites Auden as saying, “makes nothing happen.” He now recognizes that  Nietzsche’s works do function as literary wholes, not as random collections of aphorisms, and  opines that treating them as literature would allow us to admire their style, structure, etc. without  taking their worrisome prescriptions too seriously. (Again, it sounds as if the overall strategy is  to make these works boring.) Danto does insist, however, that reading them as literature would  not alter the underlying views and that even now, forty years later, he sees no reason to alter his  basic reading of Nietzsche’s philosophy. He closes by justifying the project to Dennett (and us)  as follows: “How often, after all, does a philosopher, acting in the line of duty, actually help save  lives?”   This is a lovely thought, and of course more careful reading of Nietzsche a hundred years ago  might have saved many more lives than the Pearl City murderers took. But better interpretation of  Christianity, of Islam, even of Judaism might have saved lives over the centuries as well (and then  there are the atrocities committed in the name of Marx). It may well be true that Hegel’s analysis of  the organic unity of the state paved the way for fascism, likewise Rousseau’s concept of the general  will and even Plato’s of the Kallipolis. For that matter, atrocities such as My Lai and Haditha were  committed in the name of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson. I have even heard it argued that it was  Descartes’s distinction between mind and body that led to colonial and imperial genocides inflicted  on indigenous peoples by European conquerors. One might well say that we are, as philosophers  acting in the line of duty, engaged constantly in the saving of lives.   But surely there are few who do it in as erudite and urbane a way as Danto. His spare and intel- lectually rich style is a delight to read, still, after forty years. “Students of the wise increase peace  in the world,” says the Talmud; Arthur Danto should take comfort in his role in that process.

This involves Lemm in a wide-ranging treatment  of key motifs in Nietzsche’s corpus, including illuminating his views on culture and civilization,  morality and politics, history, forgetfulness and memory, and truth. For her the human being is part  of the continuum of animal life, and, in part, she takes her inspiration from the pioneering work of  Margot Norris in her book B easts of Modern Imagination.  In Norris the author finds a new approach  to culture that is “biocentric,” that is, it is thought from the perspective of “life.” For Norris there is a  biocentric tradition of thought that includes Nietzsche and in which these thinkers—Kafka is another  example—do not create “like” the animal or in imitation of it but, rather, “as” the animal, with their  “animality” fully alive and speaking. As Lemm acknowledges, this is a contentious approach to  problems of culture and civilization simply because it is contesting the widespread Enlightenment  and humanist view that what makes culture distinctive is the way it separates the human f rom the  animal and sees culture as the task of civilizing the human animal into a moral and rational one.  With this focus, however, on “life,” this privileging of humanity over animality is reversed and the  human is given back its repressed animality.  T he critical question to ask is whether this is indeed an “enlightening” move to make and whether  it accurately captures what is taking place in Nietzsche’s philosophy with respect to questions of  humanity and animality. Lemm is aware of the dangers of her perspective and endeavors to steer  an approach that avoids the main ones, including the “biologism” of a materialist approach and the  anthropomorphism of a spiritualist approach. For her the error of a biologistic approach is that, while  taking into account the intimate relationship of human and animal life, it fails to provide an exegesis  of the meaning and significance of culture except in terms of survival and self-preservation (not core  values in Nietzsche, as is well known). The spiritualist approach cannot do justice to the physiology  of life, and here Lemm contends that Nietzsche’s reliance on physiology does not denote a crude  scientism—the application of mechanical or chemical causality to inert matter—but, rather, requires  a genealogy that is able to capture the “spiritual historicity” expressed in physiology.  T hroughout the work Lemm skillfully negotiates these various antinomies and shows herself  to be an astute and mature reader of Nietzsche. There is an abundance of genuinely fresh insights  running throughout the text, and even when she deals with seemingly all-too-familiar material,  such as the second untimely meditation or the “Truth and Lies” essay, she has novel and arresting  things to say. This also extends to her appreciation of the figure of the “sovereign individual” in  GM ,  which provides one of the best readings of  GM II:1–2 I have come across in the recent literature.  As she notes, the promise of the sovereign individual has traditionally been understood either as  antipolitical or as nonpolitical with the emphasis on individual perfectionism. Contra these readings,  Lemm seeks to show that in the figure of the sovereign individual Nietzsche provides an idea of  freedom (as responsibility) that intimately concerns the political life of human animals. For her the  primary feature of human development is the antagonism and agonism between human and animal  life forces. The restoration of animality to humanity is liberating: “When humankind defines itself  against its animality or denies its animality a productive role, forms of political life emerge based  on domination and exploitation of humans by humans” (5). One of the striking features of the  work is the extent to which it seeks to divorce Nietzsche’s thinking from being an advocate of an  authoritarian politics (of the domination and exploitation of humans). Chapter 4 is a riveting and  remarkable chapter, on giving and forgiving, in which Lemm brings Nietzsche into rapport with  the likes of Hannah Arendt and Jacques Derrida on the gift-giving virtue. Here she is at her best,  showing the extent to which Nietzsche’s politics is one of generosity and hospitality in which the  “other” is not reduced to being a mere permutation of the self.  L emm does not pursue a chronological approach in her appreciation of Nietzsche, and for me  this is one of the weaknesses of the book. She starts with  GM and culminates with chapters on “On  the Use and Disadvantage of History for Life” and “On Truth and Lies in an Extra-Moral Sense.”  JNS 40_Reviews.indd   83 11/10/10   10:23:39 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 84  BOOK REVIEWS Her approach has a tendency to collapse into one seamless whole the different and disparate parts  of Nietzsche’s corpus in which there are real and serious tensions, as well as reversals and overcom- ings, sometimes within the same block of writings (e.g., the free spirit trilogy I would contend).  Lemm reads as unproblematic, for example, Nietzsche’s position in  Human, All Too Human that  because everything is necessity then all is innocent. However, I would contend, it is possible to  see in this position a certain nihilism that the later Nietzsche was concerned to overcome. In H H  Nietzsche advises us not to judge but to be just (to imitate Christ, in effect); in the 1886 preface  to the text, however, he recognizes that injustice is inseparable from life, and the task of justice  thus becomes that much more difficult and a question of perspectivism. I am also troubled by the  way Lemm divides “civilization” and “culture,” with the latter being concerned with cultivation  and education and the former, with taming and breeding. Where civilization aims to morally and  rationally “improve” the human animal, culture for her aims to bring forth new forms of life, which  are not forms of power over animal life but overflowing with life. This is incisive but neglectful,  it seems to me, of the p ositive role breeding plays in Nietzsche’s late philosophy. Lemm sees in  Nietzsche a “politics” and a philosophy of spontaneous animal energies, vital forgetfulness, and  exuberant life, all of which is seen to work against a politics of control, calculation, prediction,  and engineering. This, however, underestimates one important aspect of Nietzsche’s late thinking  on culture and politics, namely, the need to take control of the future and to engineer it—see, for  example, his remarks on what could be b red in  BGE 203 given the proper masterful conditions of  philosophical hegemony and political legislation.  F inally, what of the plausibility of the reading of Nietzsche’s philosophy as a nimal philosophy?  I have to say I am not convinced ultimately that Nietzsche is as remote from Enlightenment and  humanist traditions as Lemm thinks. Here one could point to the middle-period Nietzsche, where  he clearly thinks that the liberation of the human being requires an emancipation from its animal  ancestry (see, e.g., W S 350). One could also lay stress on what Nietzsche says in “Schopenhauer as  Educator” (of which Lemm is a first-rate reader). On the one hand, the human feeds productively  on its own animality (e.g., animal vigor and the power of forgetting); on the other hand, it enjoys  a supreme advantage over the animal in that it is able to understand its existence metaphysically.  The animal by contrast is the site of “senseless suffering” since it is subject to hunger and desires  without having any insight into the nature of this mode of life: “To cling so blindly and madly to  life, for no higher reward, far from knowing that one is punished or why one is punished in this way,  but instead to thirst with the inanity of a horrible desire for precisely this punishment as though it  were happiness—that is what it means to be an animal” (S E 5). Surely, this is a highly lamentable  and dreadful condition humanity has the evolutionary potential to transcend or overcome. Lemm  is aware of this section in  SE and reads around it (see 52). She tries to ingeniously interpret the  passage not as indicating a removal of humanity from its animal heritage but, rather, as a specific  reference to the animality of the civilized human being or an animal defined by its attachment to  a life of mere self-preservation. I am not convinced by this. This does not deny, of course, her  ensuing insight that Nietzsche also prizes throughout his writings the return of an animality that  is overfull with life.   In conclusion, let me stress the rich and richly instructive character of this book. I have greatly  enjoyed and admired the essays on Nietzsche Lemm has been publishing in recent years. Now with  this book she consolidates her reputation as one of Nietzsche’s most original, attentive, and lively  readers. It is quite simply a superb book and one of the most thought-provoking I have read for some  time. It is both lucid and engaging and can be highly recommended.
