The Man and Wife and Their Grinding-Stone X. The Man and the Wife of His Maternal Uncle and the Birds Over the past thirteen years I have been engaged in the publication of Kaguru folklore (cf. Bibliography). This task is still far from completed; however, even at this point certain motifs are clearly prominent: old women, oppressed younger children, trickster hares, villainous hyenas, cruel step- mothers, unjust elders, all occupy morally negative or questionable posi- tions within the general system of Kaguru ideology and tradition and there- fore constitute important elements in the repertoire of any Kaguru storyteller. One such motif is that of a bird, and in this set of texts I briefly consider this in terms of various Kaguru tales and also within the wider context of certain other aspects of Kaguru thought. The broader aspects of Kaguru society may be discerned from other publications (1967¿; 1968c, 19716) and their contained bibliographies. Leach has rightly criticized those analysts who see symbolic motifs mainly at face value rather than in terms of their structural or modal signif- icance (1966). He damns Eliade and other members of the JuNGian school who construct a kind of intellectual patchwork-quilt out of scattered symbolic artifacts plucked out of the contexts of their respective cosmologies.

In short, there seem no inherent and universal symbolic significances to any object so that the analyst must search for symbolic genotypes rather than thematic phenotypes if he hopes to deal profitably with the structural nature of various myths and legends on a comparative basis. Nonetheless, certain objects do seem to have very widely held (though by no means universal) meanings or attached values, such as those associated with blood, right and left, faeces, water, light, heat. Although it is difficult to generalize, it does seem that those symbols most immediately associated with sensory perception and biological processes have the most widespread cross-cultural regularities of meaning while those sym- bolic motifs involving objects external to men seem to be subject to far greater cross-cultural variations. Even so, within geographical and cultural areas,</page><page sequence="3">164 T. O. Beidelman Anthropos 69. 1974 certain motifs sometimes seem to have wide and comparable currency. Al- though detailed and reliable data are still unavailable, this may well be the case for the bird motif in much of Bantu-speaking Africa. In this paper I consider the bird motif in one East African Bantu lan- guage-speaking society, the Kaguru of east-central Tanzania. I try to show the common attributes of birds in Kaguru folklore and go on to suggest that the bird motif fits within a wider symbolic category. I present ten Kaguru tales in which a bird of unidentified species plays a crucial role. Each tale appears in English translation and in the Kaguru original; the respective paragraphs of the translation and original texts are numbered to facilitate cross-checking. A fuller evaluation of this material and other Kaguru themes will only be possible after all of the Kaguru textual material has been published. I. The Man and His Child and the Bird I. Imunhu ne Mwanagwe ne Didege 1. Long ago there was a man and that man had a son. They cultivated their large garden and then rested there. During that time there (in the garden) a certain large bird was coming to the garden to eat maize, but they didn't know when it was coming. 2. Then one day the father and his son set a trap for the bird. Then it was caught in the father's trap. At dawn the next day the son went to check their trap and then he found that it had caught the bird. Then he untied it from the trap and then he took it to go home with it so that they might kill it and eat it with por- ridge. 3. On the way the bird spoke to the boy saying, "You, child, help me and I shall help you." That boy had thought about it and then as he was reaching home he released it and it went off. The next day that boy again went to the garden. He stayed there a long time and then he got hungry. 4. Then when he felt like that, he climbed to the top of a tall tree which 1 .

Bird, help me! Come, help me! It is I who helped you! Come, help me! It is I who helped you! Come, help me!" x 5. And when the bird heard that, it sang from where it was: "Oh, I was at a lake far away! And I heard your cry!"2 6. After it sang like that from where it came, it reached the boy in the tree and then it gave him porridge and meat and water. The boy ate until he was full. When he had finished eat- ing, the bird took him on its wings and then went oñ with him to its home. There he reached a good land with a fine village and he stayed there happily and did not again recall the place where he had come from. II. The Man and the Bird 1. Long ago there was a man and that man had a wife and four children. That man was a hunter. One day he went to the bush and there he caught a bird in a trap and when he had caught it, he took it and went home with it and on the way the bird told him, "Let me go!" But he had refused to free it. 2. The bird kept on speaking like that until home. When he reached home, he killed it but as he killed it, it sang this song: "Kill me gently, dikwüa mpaka kuchanhya, kämet foyafika uke yeja yetnba Iwimbo Iwakwe: "Idege, mphonye! Idege, mphonye! Wije, umphonye! Si nene na kuhonya! Wije, umphonye !" 5. Didege nadyo fodya hulika uko kodyowa dye ja dyemba: "Aaa neja nowa mwilamba kutali. Na nahulika ichilile chake." 6.

Thus, both important ancestral shrines and rainmaking shrines are usually located on hills or mountains. 2 A lake or pond are often associated with transition into a supernatural lana. Although it is not so stated, there is a possibility that the bird is associated with the ancestral ghosts. Kaguru believe that animals and plants that raid their gardens are sometimes manifestations of the ghosts of their dead ancestors. In such a case, it would, of course, be wrong to kill these pests.</page><page sequence="5">166 T. O. Beidelman Anthropos 69. 1974 gently! Child of the chief!

Then when that bird had been cooked, some of the children, along with their mother, refused to eat its meat because they found something marvelous in the bird speaking. The others, along with their father, ate it. When they had finished eating, at night their bellies were full and then their bellies burst. Then they died and that bird took on its former shape and then it flew off. yejayadikoma, lulo foyakikotnaga dy- eja dyemba Iwimbo Iwakwe dikugam- ba: "Unghomage lugaluga! Mwana mundewa !

The Man and His Two Wives and the Bird 1. Long ago there was a man and that man had two wives. In that land where they lived there was no forest for fetching firewood. The forest was far away. Now the wives of that man were accustomed to go there to the forest to fetch firewood, but they were to take a long time there 3. 2. One day those women went to the forest to cut firewood and then there (they found) a certain bird which was called Nyakumbe and it sang a song like this: "Nyakumbe! He beats them (on account of) this bird! Nya- kumbe ! He beats them (on account of) this bird!" 3. When those women found that, they were late (on account of) the bird III.

Chores such as these take women into the bush, the area of disorder, of wild animals, of anti-culture. Kaguru often speak of such tasks as means by which women may deceive their husbands and parents by committing adultery. What is important here is not that Kaguru women often do this but rather that going into the bush is associated with persons eluding many of the social constraints exerted over them.</page><page sequence="6">The Bird Motif in Kaguru Folklore : Ten Texts (Tanzania) 167 singing. They did that for many days, but their husband was rebuking them because every time they were going for firewood, they were returning at night. 4. Now one day those women told their husband, "We are going for fire- wood/' Then he told them, "You may go." Then they went. Then when they had gone, the husband followed them carefully behind and then he reached them but they didn't see him. 5. Then those women called the bird, "Nyakumbe!" That bird came there where they were and then it sang and then after it had finished those women started to gather firewood. But by then the sun was setting and they returned home in the dark. That hus- band left them there and they didn't see him. 6. When the husband saw that his wives had gone, he then also called that bird, "Nyakumbe!" That bird came there where he was and it sang for him the song it had sung for his women: "Nyakumbe! He beats them (on account of) this bird! Nyakumbe! He beats them (on account of) this bird!" 7. When it sang like that, that man enjoyed it very much but because he recognized that it was on account of it that his wives were returning home late, he killed it. Then he returned home. 8. Those women stayed there for a few days and then again they asked their husband to (let them) go cut firewood. He himself gave them per- mission and so they went. When they reached there, they called "Nyakum- be!" in vain. "Nyakumbe" in vain. Then they went into the forest and fodyembaga.

When they reached their husband, he asked them, "Why did you return quickly today?" Then they told him, "That which we brought (today) we had al- ready cut and hidden in a place." Their husband accepted all that they had said and he stayed nicely always with his wives. IV. The Man and the Bird 1. Long ago there was a man and that man was very poor so that even getting his food was difficult work. Be- cause he didn't have anything and also because there was a famine in the land he went to the river where he was staying and there his food was crabs which he was catching every day. 2. One day a bird came there to the river near the house where he was staying and then it perched in a tree and that bird greeted him and then asked, "What are you doing on the riverbank?" He said, "I'm just staying here because my food is the crabs from the river." 3. When the bird saw him like that, it felt much pity and then it said, "If I give you riches, would you tam- per with them?" He himself said, "I wouldn't". After the bird said that, it went off 4. 4. The second day the bird came there again and it found him sitting eating crabs and then again it said, weja wenanga lowo disedika baho. 9.

He himself said, "I wouldn't!" 5. On the third day the bird came secretly and then it suddenly seized him as he was eating his crabs and went off with him to a distant land and then put him down in its village. Then it gave him a large house to stay in and there were people who were working for him and also he was given a woman. 6. But later that bird showed him a house and all that was inside it, but there was a certain room which was closed. The bird told him, "This room is not to be opened." Then he agreed to that. Resting there for many days he truly got to be a rich man. 7. Now one day as he was staying there he got to thinking, "Now if I opened up this room, what (more) would I get to be?" Then he opened it. When he opened it, he found that bird there inside. The bird asked him saying, "Are you tampering with (your) ri- ches?" That man had nothing to say. 8. The next day the bird came and then it found him there at the house where he had opened the room which he was not supposed to see. Then it told him, "I want to send you to your home." That man had refused but la- ter he had agreed because he saw that that bird was angry because he had tampered with his riches when he had opened the door of that room. 9. Before he knew it, that bird had suddenly picked him up and then the bird returned him just there to the river and then he returned to his life of eating crabs and then he died there at the river. ba, "Ningha kwingha undewa kole- wa?"

One day that father had set his two traps and in the mor- ning he told his children to go to check them and then both those two went to check as they had been told by their father. When they had reached there, they saw that those traps had caught two birds. Then they took those birds and when they had finished taking them, they returned home. 2. When they returned near enter- ing the village, the one boy who was elder freed the bird and then it went away. That bird was freed because it was very beautiful and therefore that boy did not like it to be killed by his father or himself. When he reached there at their home, the younger of the children had told his father that his elder brother had freed the bird. 3. Their father did not say anything and was silent. Now one day that father had called that elder son who had freed the bird; then he told him that they should go to the bush so that they might eat honey and then that boy had agreed. When they had gone there to the bush, the father had told his son, "Take this wooden honey- bowl and climb the tree to fetch honey from the tree above." Then that boy had climbed the tree and then he took all the honey and then he dropped it down in the wooden honeybowl to his father. 4. When the father saw that he had got what he wanted, he cut the wooden bowl full of honey free (from the rope) and then his father cut the rope on V. Imunhu na Wanagwe Weli /.

He finished ea- ting that and the ribs on his side which leaned against the branch of the tree had started to rot 5. 5. Now when he felt close to dying, he sang his song but did not know whether that bird would really come and he sang like this: "Bird, help me! Bird, help me! Come, help me who helped you ! Oh, who helped you, come help me!" 6. Then as the boy sang like that, that bird which he had freed came quickly up to there where he was and told him, "Take hold of my body." Then that boy held it and then when he had taken hold of it, it flew with him up beyond and there when it was at its place it washed out those maggots which were in his rotting ribs and then when it had finished, it put medicine there. 7.

The Man and His Son and the Bird VI. Imunhu ne Mwanagwe ne Didege 1. Long ago there was a man and that man married a wife and then they produced their son. That child grew and then later he became a large boy. One day that man had gone to the bush and then he set his trap and then he returned home. 2. In the morning he told his son, "My child, go check our trap." That /. Baho katali kowa na munhu naye imunhu yuyo yatola muket ka- mei weja weleka mwana wao wa chigosi.

Such persons were killed and then thrown in the bush rather than buried, for a witch is not thought to become a proper ancestral ghost and therefore is not considered fit to be buried. By being thrown into the bush, the corpse is consigned to the wilderness, the area of disorder and anti- social behaviour.</page><page sequence="12">The Bird Motif in Kaguru Folklore : Ten Texts (Tanzania) 173 boy set out to go to the bush. He saw that his father's trap had caught a bird. The boy took that bird and then he started to return home with it. On the way that bird told that boy, "Help me and I shall help you." It went on saying that and then later that boy freed it and went off. 3. When he reached home, his fa- ther asked, "Where is the bird? Wasn't it caught in the trap?" The boy told him, "It caught it, but I let it go!" When his father heard that, he got angry and then he told his son, "You follow my bird and bring it here! Go!" Then that boy set out and went to the bush following the bird. 4. He travelled by night and day and then on the third day he saw a very tall tree far off and that tree had many birds perched on its branches. He went there up to the tree and then he sang his song: "I am going to fetch father's bird! The nice one spotted all over!" 5. After he sang like that, he saw the man who owned the birds who appeared there at the tree. Then he asked that boy, "Why have you come here?" Then that boy told him, "I am going searching for father's bird." When that man heard that he told him, "Your bird is not here." Then the boy left there and continued with his jour- ney. 6. He went on and on and then he again reached a tree full of birds and these had nests with eggs. As he got nearer he saw that there was a house and he went up to it and then stood at its front-ground but that house was quiet. Then later the boy saw a man come imutego wetu."

The nice one spot- ted all over!" 8. When he had finished singing his song, that man approached nearby and then he asked, "Why have you come here?" Then the boy told him, "I have come looking for father's bird." Then the man asked, "What did that bird that you freed do?" The boy told him, "The bird told me, 'Help me and I shall help you next year'." 9. When he told him that, that man said to him, "Your bird is here." Then he caught it and then he also gave him five eggs and then he told him, "Break these eggs at the river near your place and they shall produce (things)." 10. That boy set off and then re- turned home and when he reached the river near his home he broke one egg and then a man came out and he was brownish. Then (the boy) threw away the other eggs. That man who came from the egg told the boy, "Don't throw away the eggs ! They will produce things at home." 11. The boy ignored that man and he even pushed him down because he thought he was speaking nonsense. That man told the boy, "Now why are you pushing me ? Give me the eggs and I'll carry them if you don't want them, because they will produce things at home." 12. After they came from there they took the way home and when they appeared his father was very pleased to see his child.

When they had cut into its stomach, eggs came out. They broke those eggs and then those produced a fine house and many fine things and there were many people inside who were making food and working. When they broke the second, it produced cows and herdsmen. 14. Then they killed one of the cows. When it was dead, they cooked the meat and when it was cooked and ready they cooked porridge and then all their people who came from the eggs ate. The father and mother of that boy had a helping of food with meat of the bird, but the mother of the boy refused to eat the meat of the bird and wanted meat of the cow so they gave her cow (meat). 15. When that woman ate a little of the meat of the cow, she died right there. It was very surprising. When the woman died like that, the horn was blown to tell people and then very many people had come to ask why the horn had sounded. 16. Then they were told everything that had happened there. The hus- band of the woman who died was kil- led. Then those people who were wor- king told those (other) people who kil- led that man that, "Why have you killed your comrade ?"

VII. The Man and His Child and the Bird VII. Imunhu ne Mwanagwe ne Didege 1. Once long ago there was a man and that man had a wife and then they produced a son. The village where they were staying was large so that there were many people. That man was rich with goats and chickens at his house. There nearby the village was a hill and it had many trees. 2. There from time to time a large bird came which was catching the goats and chickens of that elder. At the time that that bird was catching these, their son was chasing it to save their goats and chickens. 3. Now one day that man and wife went to cultivate. Afterwards that bird came and caught a goat. The boy beat it with a stick but it told him, "Let me alone! You have fought the battle !" The boy found it a marvelous thing to hear the bird speak and so he stopped beating it. /. Baho katali kowa na munhu imunhu yuyo yowa na muke kamei weja weleka mwana wao wa chigosi.

One day that bird came again and then it caught a child and went off with it. The people got worried on account of that bird and how it was finishing off (first) goats and then later even catching people. 5. Many days passed after the day when it had caught the child. One day that boy who had beaten the bird was resting in the shade of a tree which was near their house. Suddenly before the boy noticed he had been taken off by the bird which then flew off with him. 6. When it went off with him, it took him to a place where there was a village and then it dropped him down where the village of that bird was. That boy found it marvelous to see that bird was (really) a person, for when it drop- ped him, he saw it shed its wings and then it put them in a tree nearby its house. 7. When the boy had stayed there a short time, he found all their chickens and goats which had been caught at their place. Later he also saw some people from their place who had been caught by the bird. He was given food by that bird, but at that time it was not a bird but instead a person. Later that boy was given by the bird the rule of that village which was large. 8. Many days passed and then that person who was the bird told that boy, "Now I want to send you to your home. I have nothing to give you to go with, but I shall give you wealth in money for when you speak coins shall come from your mouth." Then truly that boy got wealth of money.

There all the people were sur- prised to see him because they had left him (for lost) for many days. But when they greeted him, he did not reply to the greetings which were given by people. The clan kinsmen of that boy took him and then they went with him inside his father's house, but even at that time he still was not speaking to any person. 10. Out of joy for his child, his fa- ther slayed a goat that his child might eat meat. At evening time when people were returning and entertaining at their house, his father and mother tried to speak with him in order that he might tell them where he had been all those years. 11. When the boy saw that only his father and mother remained alone with him, he opened his mouth to speak, but then when he tried to speak he produced coins. Mwaa! His father and mother picked up coins until nightfall because the boy kept on chatting with them. 12. At dawn the next day many people came to greet him and they entered one by one inside his father's house. Each person who entered got much money when he chatted with him and those few he got were his and when all the people saw that, they felt jealous in their hearts. 13. Now one day a certain boy in that village also wanted to beat that bird which gave wealth to his comrade. At that time the bird was again coming to take things as it had been doing before. One day the bird came and then it took a sheep of that second boy pesa. Didege dyamwinula kahi kantet mpaka kuchilunga cho ukwao uko dyeja dyamuhulumusa hakaya yodya- mulala. 9.

Long ago there were three men and they were staying in one village. One day they set out to go to the bush to hunt, and so they travelled and travelled and then one of the three comrades had separated off from them and he went his way alone. 2. On the way which he was passing alone, he got a packet of money. But those comrades of his only got tortoises on their way. Ahead that one who was alone also got three cows; later ahead he got goats and sheep. 3. Then ahead he again met with his two comrades at a certain river having no water but only sand and which was called Mhelule. Then when those people saw all the things that their comrade had got they killed him. 4. There as they were killing him with clubs his blood had spurted so that even their eyes and clothes were stai- ned with blood 7.

Then when those two people saw the bird singing like that they said, "Say, let's kill this bird which is ma- king noises at us!" So then they shot it and it died, and then the blood of the bird also spurted on them. Then when they had left there they returned home. 6. They took those cows and goats and money along with the sheep of their comrade whom they had killed. Then they reached their village. Later they were asked, "Where is your friend with whom you went?" 7. Then they themselves said, "He walked off on his own." Those people asked and then got to doubting so they called the elders and then they came there. Those elders questioned those men saying, "You, when did you leave your comrade?" Then while they were still there speaking they saw that bird which they had killed come there to the village where they were. 8. Then it sang saying, "They killed their friend at Mhelule!" Then as the bird sang like that the elders came. Then those elders summoned many people that day in order that they might tell them (everything). When the people came they told them, "These people have killed their comrade; the bird just now sang this." 9. That day the men didn't say any- thing. They returned home with those elders.

In the evening that bird had gone inside and then it told (the people) saying, "I am their comrade whom they killed at the Mhelule river! I changed myself into a bird!" Then there indoors it again was a human being just as it had been before. Then they kept him there indoors while the case over those men was still continuing to be spoken. 11. Then that day the case was com- pleted. Again in the morning the people met together and then they told those people that, "Truly, you have killed your comrade!" But they kept on denying this. 12. Then the mother of that man who was killed had told the people who were there, "Let me go inside!" Then those who had killed their comrade felt a- shamed when they saw him. 13. Then when that man was ques- tioned by the people, he told them, "These men killed me at the Mhelule river." When (the men) were questioned, they didn't speak anymore. Then those men were taken out (from the village) and then they were killed. IX. The Man and Wife and Their Grinding-Stone 1.

When he went for a walk he con- tinued with a further journey to go to lands far away so that there behind his wife got very worried. But the people failed (to find him). Now one day he decided to return home so then he returned to his homeland. There he got to thinking about his arrival and said (to himself), "If my wife knew that I'd arrive today she'd prepare food with her grinding-stone so that I might eat immediately for I am very hungry." 3. There while he was talking he was overheard by a small bird perched listening in a tree. Then that small bird had flown to that man's house and there sang: "Grinding so, oh ! Grin- ding so, oh ! Food so, oh ! Husband so, oh! Is coming so, oh! Is near so, oh! Cheer him so, oh ! 4. When the wife saw that small bird singing like that she called the people and then that small bird sang to those people who were amazed. Then that woman took her grinding-stone and then ground a great deal of flour to make preparations for her husband. A day passed and the husband arrived. The people greeted him very happily and then a cow was killed and he stayed with his wife for many days. X. The Man and the Wife of His Maternal Uncle and the Birds 8 1.

That sister's son had been working at his maternal uncle's in the hope that his maternal uncle's wife would bear a daughter whom he might marry. There- fore that man was staying at his maternal uncle's home until when his maternal uncle's wife would be preg- nant 9. 2. One day that man went to culti- vate his garden while he left the wife of that maternal uncle of his back there at the village. That man was cultivating and then he got tired and therefore got very troubled with hun- ger. So then that man returned to the village. 3. When he arrived he found that his maternal uncle's wife had gone to cut firewood, so he went into his house and slept there due to hunger. While he was still resting he saw his boy- cousins slimb up to the granary and take bananas to eat. Since he himself was hungry he decided that he'd climb up and take some of the bananas in the granary of his maternal uncle 10. 4. When the boys left he himself also went into the house and climbed up into the granary. While he was still there in the granary his maternal uncle's wife returned with her firewood, dropped her load down and then went into her house. 5.

Sometimes such engagements with cousins were arranged even before the birth of the girl concerned. 10 Granary (ikano) ; in every Kaguru house there is a shelf-like upper story where food is stored. This is the most private part of any Kaguru home and should not be entered by strangers. This is very improper conduct; no one should enter another's house in the owner's absence, much less that owned by the person above one in authority.</page><page sequence="24">The Bird Motif in Kaguru Folklore: Ten Texts (Tanzania) 185 called for the old women n so they came there. That youth was just silent up there since he had no way of getting out. Then the old women tended that woman until she delivered a daughter. That boy stayed there in the granary until midnight and then when all the people in the house were sleeping and the whole village silent the boy deci- ded, "Now I'll come down!" So he stealthily came down, opened the door, went out and went into his own house 12. 6. Before he was asleep he heard birds flying out in the night, flap, flap, flap. There were two large ones and one perched on that house where the child had been born and one perched on his own house. Then that one which perched on the house where the child was born called to its comrade, "Say there!" Then its comrade replied, "Yes!" 7. Then it said, "This house where I am has a baby." Then its comrade said, "What kind of baby?" Then it said, "A girl." Then that one said, yejayenanga wadala chimwande kämet we ja we ja bahadya.

This may well relate to their liminal roles between the born and unborn, parallel to that of old women standing between the living and dead, for the unborn come at their birth out of the land of the dead. 12 The boy has broken several extremely serious prohibitions; such infractions are thought to bring on serious supernatural dangers from ancestral ghosts. However, these dangers need not fall upon the offender, but may fall, as in this tale, upon those who are unknowingly involved. The prohibitions are: à) a sister's son should strictly avoid any informal (especially sexual) relations with the wife of his maternal uncle. At that uncle's death, such a woman may be inherited matrilineally by such a youth but Kaguru say that this is all the more reason why such prohibitions should be observed during the uncle's lifetime. They say that were a youth to enjoy or covet an uncle's wife, he would want to marry her and might therefore bewitch her present husband, b) Kaguru sharply distinguish between the attributes of men and women. Many of the most important life crises defining sexuality involve ritual in which the opposite sex must be excluded. Birth is one such event, c) A son-in-law should scrupulously avoid his wife's mother, especially during the early sages of engagement and marriage. Absolutely no hint of sexuality should ever pass between them - this would include such a situation.</page><page sequence="25">186 T. O.

That child grew up and then was a maiden. Now one day the girl's fa- ther brewed beer for a dance so that his child might be engaged to his neph- ew and then he gave her to him. One day that man (nephew) was in his garden and his wife was tending to hers and then he saw a buffalo come so he shot it with his gun and it died. 9. So they ate up all the meat. Now when the buffalo died that husband took those horns and threw them into the household-garden because he didn't want to throw them away. He put those horns there for dancing cele- brations 13. Now one day the wife went out from their house to go to the house- hold-garden to fetch some stalks of maize and then she stumbled and fell on the buffalo horns and died. Then she was taken by the people and buried in a grave. Kämet dia nadyo dyagamba, "Idifa dyakwe imwanago dije dyuwe choni?"

Eleven other such tales have already been published elsewhere: 2nd tale, 1963/; 4th, 5th, 10th tales, 1964a; 3rd tale, 19646; 3rd, 7th tales, 1965a; 8th tale, 19676; 3rd, 11th tales, 1967c; 1st tale, 1970e. I have restricted my consideration of birds to those flying creatures clearly part of the wilder- ness. I do not consider stories in which birds appear as anthropomorphic protagonists with other anthropomorphized animals, as creatures within the sphere of human social behaviour, cf. 1st tale, 1963¿; 8th tale, 1964a; 1st, 2nd, 6th tales, 1967a; 2nd tale, 1974a. Thus chickens never fall into this category; these are domesticated creatures in no appreciable way figuring in Kaguru oral literature. The Kaguru word for bird is ndege, the same term used for omen. Of course, it is possible that these terms are mere homonyms, but this seems 13 Such horns are blown at many changes and ceremonies. They would be stuck upright into the soil to prevent their damage.</page><page sequence="26">The Bird Motif in Kaguru Folklore : Ten Texts (Tanzania) 187 unlikely. Considering the fact that birds are one of the most important and dramatic of these omens, it seems likely that the terms have a common origin, not only in Kaguru but in Swahili as well (1963A). The material presen- ted here would support this contention in that the ways birds figure in Kaguru tales are parallel in symbolism to the notion of omens, that is, of superna- tural manifestations of the connexions between the sphere of reality as it is comprehended by ordinary men and as it exists in terms of the effects of supernatural, inexplicable forces which Kaguru believe modify that reality. Kaguru both seek and avoid contact between these spheres, for interpéné- tration between them causes disorder but this in turn can be resolved only by recognizing and manipulating this disorder. This intrusion of the super- natural into the sphere of the ordinary is often due to the dead being dis- pleased with the misconduct of the living. Sometimes this is because the dead resent being forgotten and unpropitiation by the living. Kaguru believe that the dead sometimes take the forms of wild animals and birds which are pests. Feeding in this way the dead are both nourished and show their displeasure. In one tale the dead appear as wild pigs (1st tale, 1964&amp;) ; in another a dead ancestress appears as an eagle which abducts a child but which is calmed when that child is later given a name linking her to the dead (3rd tale, 1964Ö). It could be argued that the dead are especially associated with predatory birds. Babies are born from out of the land of the dead and the dead seek to draw them back, especially during the first days of birth. One of the first ceremonies Kaguru enact to fix a child within the land of the living involves the bateleur eagle (ipungu, Terathropius ecaudatus). In a ceremony called kumlafu (driving out) a doctor passes a winnowing tray over a newborn infant on the day it is first brought out of the house where it was born. This is said to protect the child from this eagle and similar birds which otherwise might seize it. Even the shadows of such birds might otherwise harm the infant. Many important Kaguru omens involve some unusual appearance or behaviour of a bird (1963A). This may involve good fortune or bad. In omens it is the extraordinary behaviour or occurrence of a creature (or event) that heralds a future departure from order. These involve the behaviour of ani- mated creatures. Thus, a solar eclipse or a comet would not be considered any kind of omen while a bird perching on a person's body or an antelope entering a livestock enclosure would. In Kaguru tales birds provide important pivotal roles in many plots. They share this function with other liminal, ambiguous characters. Eventually they resolve whatever difficulty was raised in the plot. These liminal dra- matic roles make sense in terms of other ambiguous qualities of disposition or appearance held by these characters. Among human beings such roles are often filled by old women, scabious boys or strangers. Elsewhere I have indicated why old women hold such ambiguous positions in real life in a matri- lineal society such as the Kaguru's (1961); strangers, of course, stand out- side conventional boundaries of control and expectation, and scabious persons are physically disordered, their skin surfaces disturbed and their affliction</page><page sequence="27">188 T. O. BeidelmaN Anthropos 69. 1974 considered contagious. All are thought to be endowed with mysterious powers and this, in turn, may make them useful but also make them resemble wit- ches, for uncontrolled and poorly comprehended power is very dangerous and not moral. In the world of animals, Kaguru themselves tend to juxtapose hares and hyenas, the former clever but good, the latter scheming and witchlike. Elsewhere I discuss these attributes in detail (1974a, 1974Ö). It suffices here to note that intelligence and perception are somehow related to quickness and facility of movement. Snakes and birds also occupy such positions, with snakes being assigned good or bad qualities in different texts, but birds being invariably associated with good or, at the least, attractive qualities. Owls and night hawks are the witches of the bird world, but these are never men- tioned in any of the texts collected. They are associated with several bad omens. Snakes and birds are always endowed with supernatural powers, in contrast to hyenas and hares which rely rather upon their physical and mental abilities to prevail. Whatever magical skills hares and hyenas may possess are not essential to a plot and do not serve to differentiate them per se from the other protagonists, whereas this is always the striking differential feature for snakes and birds. Thus, old women, scabious persons and strangers are liminal but human ; hares and hyenas are caricatures of humans, while snakes and birds, even when they sometimes transform themselves into human form stand furthest from humans in powers and character. It would seem likely that both their shapes and spheres of habitation, along with their facility of movement, separate them from men even more than are other animals. In the tales published, birds are often helpful, especially to the disad- vantaged 14, but they severely punish those who later disobey their instructions or basic morality in general 15. They are valued or seductive 16, and avenge wrongs 17, sometimes through transformation of the victim into a bird 18. They are sometimes associated with old women or scabious youths 19, and with bodies of water 20. Birds are never represented unfavourably in Kaguru folklore. Their supernatural powers are used violently only to punish humans who have failed to behave morally toward other men or to observe the proper relations toward birds themselves. As a rule Kaguru do not eat wild birds other than those resembling domestic fowl, such as guineahens, francolins, wild ducks, though there do not seem to be any formal prohibitions against this. Birds' freedom of movement and their association with height both relate them to the supernatural, since the dead are quick moving and often associated with 14 2, 1963/; 10, 1964a; 3, 1965a; 7, 1965a; 1, 19706; 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, this paper. 15 2, 1964/; 7, 1965a; 4, 6, 7, this paper. 16 4, 1964; 3, this paper. 17 2, 1963/; 5, 1964; 11, 1967c; 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, this paper. 18 3, 1967c; 8, 19676; 8, this paper. 19 4, 10, 1964a; 3, 19646. 20 4, 1964a; 3, 19646; 7, 1965a; 1, 4, this paper.

Curiously, they are also associated with caves and crevices as well.
