<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Article The Ancient Art of Northern Asia. By ANATOLY I. MARTYNOV. Translated and edited by Demitri B. Shimkin and Edith M. Shimkin. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1991. 300 pp., 147 figures. $40.00 ISBN 0-252-01219-4 Reviewed by Esther Jacobson, Department of Art History, University of Oregon The author of this book is the Soviet archaeologist, Anatoly I. Martynov. Early in his career he worked with A. P. Okladnikov; more recently Martynov has done important excavations on Tagar sites in the forest-steppe of the Minusinsk Basin. Martynov's text has been translated by Demitri B. Shimkin, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Geography at University of Illinois. In this task, Shimkin had the assistance of his late wife, Edith M. Shimkin. Shimkin has also contributed two small sections to the text. The book is an attractive publication. Type-set, maps, and line drawings are clear and easy to read. At the time of publication this book was the only source in any language that promised to look at the art of "northern Asia" in terms of its grand sweep, from the Paleolithic down to the end of the first millennium A.D. In fact, the book's title is more inclusive than are the contents. Martynov's focus is the archaeology of the basins of the great Siberian rivers, from the Ob on the west to the Amur on the east; the archaeology of the Altay</page><page sequence="2">66 Mongolian Studies , 1993 Mountains, and to a lesser extent, of the Sayan Mountains; and some finds from the Transbaykal and northern Mongolia. On occasion, the author returns to the Ural region, but without chronological consistency. In addition to an introduction and conclusion, the book is divided into six chapters. Each chapter has been given a title which purports to situate the discussion in terms of interpretative strategies. In general, the division of the chapters is chronological, but that delineation is frequently subordinated to a broader conceptual perspective. Too often the principle of inclusion and exclusion of material is unclear. In light of the book's intention to describe, analyze, and interpret "the basic genres of Siberian archaeological art from the Paleolithic to medieval times" (p. xv), the actual contents are markedly incomplete. Because this book treats a major region of the world and a number of significant artistic traditions, and because it introduces an important area of scholarship to the English language reader, a careful discussion is warranted. Chapter 1, "The Art of the Mammoth Hunters," focuses on the art of the Paleolithic period, with particular attention to specific sites and finds. In considering scattered bone carvings of female figures, birds, and mammoths, the author introduces the concept of the "semantic" content of art. This is a traditional Soviet category, roughly similar to the Western notion of iconography or to semiotic categories. Unfortunately, the author does not clarify what he intends by that term nor does the discussion illuminate it. Chapter 2, "Sacred Animals and Solar Symbols," is concerned with the art of Neolithic North Asia. The author introduces his consideration by referring to Neolithic cultures' "ideational, semantic bases . . . the world outlook of hunters and primitive hunting magic" (p. 15). The primary art forms considered in this chapter include ceramic vessels, petroglyphic representations of moose, goats, and sheep of the forest zone, of the Altay-Sayan region, of the upper Yenisey,</page><page sequence="3">Review Article 67 and of the Transbaykal (in which he apparently includes northern Mongolia); and mask images from the Amur River. Marty nov seems to consider the chronology of petroglyphic images to be without question; in fact, the issue of dating is a major problem in the study of any prehistoric art. While there is considerable agreement that the images of female moose, such as those found on the cliff walls above the Tom', Angara, and Yenisey rivers, are datable to the Neolithic period, there is no such certainty with regard to images of large sheep and goats. The masks from the Amur River are entirely uncertain in dating. Okladnikov has suggested a broad horizon within the Neolithic period (Okladnikov 1981), but the appearance of masks on layers above those referring to moose - at the Angara site of Second Stone Island, on the Shalobolin cliffs on the Yenisey, and on the slabs from Karakol - suggest the possibility of a post- Neolithic dating. In his discussion of Transbaykal petroglyphs, the author refers to the images of frontal birds and "enclosures," both of which can be dated no earlier than the late Bronze Age (see Okladnikov and Zaparozhskaya 1970, and Tivanenko 1981.) In this chapter Martynov establishes a strategy which uses unexamined interpretative traditions (e.g., "primitive magic") and arguments by analogy to infer meaning. For example, without defining his terminology, he refers to the images of bear and moose as "amulets, receptacles of desire" (p. 22). Moose images are indicative of a "moose epic," despite the improbability of a contemporary epic tradition. In order to explain the nature of bird images as "sacred," the author turns to such distant and disconnected sources as Egypt and Longfellow's Song of Hiawatha, creating from superficial analogies a ratatouille of possibilities. One is frustrated, here, by the author's inability to establish a framework by which to consider the relatively limited aspects of style and technology available to the prehistoric artist. Martynov asserts, for example, that</page><page sequence="4">68 Mongolian Studies , 1993 "these artists did not know many other ways [i.e. than the profile view] of representing animals" (p. 29), ignoring the fact that in the case of rock carvings and paintings, the profile view offers the greatest clarity and the best indication of vitality. Here and throughout the book one finds rather too much made of the few recorded representations of animal and human copulation; when this theme is discussed, it lacks conceptual refinement. Thus, for example, in speaking of two scenes from the Tom' and Angara rivers, in which ithyphallic males appear behind and as if approaching a large female moose, the author observes that these scenes show how "Man, attracted by his desires, filled with concern for good fortune, takes part in this process [of copulation] himself - or, more exactly, it is an anthropomorphic being, an ancestor and protector of the clan that does so" (p. 30). He does not address the first and obvious problem: whether these images were done purposely and at the same time; or whether they represent two different chronological layers, with the ithyphallic figures added later and opportunistically to the earlier moose images. Second, there is no way of knowing what these scenes meant to whomever was responsible for the male figures. To speak of "desire," "ancestors," or clan protectors is to read modern content into silent ancient images. No less troubling is Martynov's final discussion of a damaged moose image from the Tom' River complex, seemingly marked with the eyes and mouth of a "mythic ancestor to whom rites were dedicated" (p. 42). In Chapter 3, "Three-eyed Idols and Enigmatic Masks," Martynov focuses on the "paleometallic epoch," by which he means the Eneolithic and Bronze Ages. In appropriately identifying the significance of this age of fundamental cultural transition, the author introduces conceptions of culture and of process which resist clarity, e.g., when he speaks of "different culture-historical and economic ties . . . [which] crossed the steppes. The rivers . . . ceased to have this [which?]</page><page sequence="5">Review Article 69 function in the new epoch" (p. 44). His dating of the Bronze Age as early as the second half of the third millennium is exceedingly problematic; indeed, I know of no site which would allow a dating earlier than the early second millennium B.C. His discussion of the "genres" of art characteristic of this period is perplexing: the three categories to which he refers - "rich, decorative art " on pottery and bronze objects, petroglyphic art, and "religious representations on gravestones and artistic metal castings" (p. 45) - are not mutually distinctive categories. His discussion of pottery does not support his contention that pottery ornament qualifies as a distinctive genre, and he ignores the equally important aspects of body type and technology. Marytnov's discussion of the Andronovo and Karasuk "periods" - by which he presumably means cultures - ignores the issue of their origins and of their merging within the Minusinsk Basin. Indeed, an understanding of the western origins of the Andronovo culture and of the northern forest origins of Karasuk is essential if one is to make sense of the great artistic traditions of the mature Bronze Age in Siberia. Furthermore, cultural interchange must be considered in terms of an evolving cultural ecology; at the least, any discussion of prehistoric art must be referred to a protracted process of clash and gradual accommodation. The reader is regularly bothered by the omission of vital information. For example, the author refers to the Yelovo culture (p. 48; in the index it is referred to as a "site") without indicating where in the huge Siberian forest zone it may be found. He briefly discusses the Seyma-Turbino bronzes of western Siberia without indicating their vital if unclear relationship with the bronzes of the Karasuk culture and with those of the North China Bronze culture (pp. 47-48). His consideration of the so-called Okunev statuary (apparently the "idols" to which he refers in the chapter title) is equally unsatisfactory. There has been considerable and serious disagreement regarding the dating of these stelae -</page><page sequence="6">70 Mongolian Studies , 1993 whether they are Neolithic, Eneolithic, or Bronze Age - and the reader should be made aware of those problems. The stones have also been badly damaged and dislocated by the wear and tear of time, animals, and humans. We are not told that they were part of elaborate ritual sites (see Kyzlasov 1986) and that in their original setting they faced to the east. While Martynov refers to the images as "manlike," many of the stones, including some which he reproduces (e.g., fig. 64), have swelling breasts and wombs and must refer to a female entity. Equally disconcerting are the careless terminology and the opinions reflective of intense subjectivity. For example, what does it mean to say that cultures are based upon "three worldwide [?] dimensions of primitive materialistic philosophy: the cults of the sun, sacred animals, and nature (the Tree of Life, the restoration of life)" (p. 45)? What is "culture-genetic leveling" (p. 45)? The critical reader flounders before the statement that the Okunev stones are "full of fantasy and enigmatic thought," that they are "not truly anthropomorphic but iconographie images related to solar, vegetative, and snake cults" (p. 48). Martynov appears to have based his interpretation of these stones almost entirely upon the dated position of Savenkov (1910) and with no acknowledgment of the more recent contributions of Vadetskaya, Kyzlasov, and other Soviet scholars. Chapter 4, "The Golden Reindeer Flying to the Sun," continues the discussion of artistic traditions into the early Iron Age; it also continues to ignore underlying cultural ecology. Beginning with a sudden shift down to the sixth century B.C. and with a traditional review of basic theories on the origins of the art of the Scytho-Siberians, the author emphasizes that "the dissemination of the . . . Animal Style was promoted by the progressive [in what sense?] evolution of animal husbandry and with it a highly mobile population, and by the development of contacts on a large scale across the breadth of the steppes" (p.</page><page sequence="7">Review Article 71 53). The very term, "Animal Style," has been seriously discredited in recent years; and while a Soviet scholar may not be expected to know that, his Western collaborators and editors should be more aware of such issues. He does not indicate from where that "mobile population" spread out, nor do his remarks indicate that such mobility was limited: there is ample indication that in specific regions, e.g., the Altay, the Minusinsk Basin, and the basin of the Ili River, mobility would best be characterized as transhumant rather than nomadic. Furthermore, in referring to the common Indo-Iranian ethnic origin of the Scytho-Siberian peoples (p. 53), the author continues a tradition of ignoring fundamental considerations: 1) we do not know the languages of most of these peoples; 2) paleoanthropological studies indicate considerable racial intermixing in the regions of the Altay Mountains, northern Mongolia, and even the Minusinsk Basin; and 3) "Indo-Iranian" and "Indo-European" refer to cultthral constructs based on language and not to archaeologically retrieved material cultures. Simply put, if we don't know anything about the language of the culture, then all the so-called sun disks, mirrors, and gold do not make for an Indo-European or Indo-Iranian culture. Martynov's very naming of the so-called "developmental regions" of the Animal Style (sic) is problematic. For example, he refers to the Sarmatians of the Volga-Urals region when he must mean the Sauromatians. He calls the cultures of the Altay and western Siberia "Altayan," a term which seems misplaced with regard to the latter area. Moreover, "Altayan" is not used in sources on the art of these peoples and regions; "Early Nomadic" or "of the Pazyryk culture" are frequent appellations. There is still insufficient data to indicate how the "inner Asiatic" peoples of the Transbaykal and Mongolia contributed to the distinctive art of the Scytho-Siberians. One could make a case for that argument, but the author does not. Finally, the Ordos can hardly be considered to be a</page><page sequence="8">72 Mongolian Studies , 1993 developmental region: those materials which have until recently been called "Ordos" are all chance finds. But in the end the author begs his own question about origins by concluding that the "most correct viewpoint ... [is that] in each of these regions, the Animal Style arose and developed substantially independently, yet was affected by external contacts" (p. 65). Chapter 4 is essentially divided between an examination of Altay art and Tagar art, i.e. between the art of a region (called here Gornyy Altay - instead of the Altay? Gorno-Altayskaya A.O.?) and the art of a culture (Tagar) within the Minusinsk Basin. Despite major omissions - e.g. Tuekta, Bashadar, Ulandryk - Martynov argues for the essentially decorative nature of Altay art (p. 55). The discussion of that tradition is focused on specific objects and images without consideration of the manner in which they were organized on the bodies of horses and human. The resulting approach is haphazard. Thus, for example, in speaking of the huge felt hanging from Pazyryk 5, the author refers to the image of a "phoenix, an anthropomorphic monster, and a goddess sitting on a throne" (p. 57), whereas the "phoenix" and "monster" were found only in fragments from the lower right corner of the hanging and the "goddess," together with an approaching unmentioned horseman, was actually repeated at least eight times across the face of the hanging. (N.B., elsewhere, fig. 132, the female is referred to as a "goddess of fertility.") His discussion of solar cults reflects a proclivity for finding evidence for sun worship in every circular object; but the round objects originally placed on some of the horses' foreheads can no more certainly be explained as solar symbols (p. 57) than can the modern-day button. Wooden pendants are identified by him as "commas," whereas all excavators of Altay burials have correctly understood them to be replicas of boar tusks. According to the author, the phoenixes (actually, pheasants) on the famous Chinese silk from Pazyryk 5 correspond to "courtly communications" (p. 58) - an explanation</page><page sequence="9">Review Article 73 which should leave even the most willing reader thoroughly perplexed. Most frustrating, perhaps, is his assertion that one of the carved faces on the tenth bridle (Rudenko's numbering) from Pazyryk 1 is that of a "European face with animal ears and bushy hair and beard. . . . Such a representation ... is typically early classical Greek" (p. 58). To my knowledge, there is nothing in classical Greek art which would justify such a statement. In introducing the basic "genres" of Tagar art, the author speaks of non- parallel categories, i.e., reindeer images (apparently omitting the obvious Tagar representations of moose), rams and goats, geometric ornaments, and petroglyphs (p. 59). His discussion of the typology of the reindeer images - apparently based upon the typology of Chlenova - is overly complex, dry, and troubled by unclear terminology and processes, e.g., ". . . it may be conjectured that Type 1, with S-shaped (sinuous) antlers, diffused first. . . . Stylization took place, with the infusion of traits of the moose into the reindeer figure" (p. 61). The discussion is all the more confusing because while the text refers to specific images within single plates, on the plates there are no individualized identifications. D. B. Shimkin (N.B., the name given here is different from that given elsewhere to the same contributor) has added a short section on petroglyphs of the Tagar period, among which are included deer stones. Unfortunately, the deer stones cannot be associated with Tagar culture: they did not occur in the Minusinsk Basin and they were almost certainly earlier than the period of Tagar art - perhaps as early as the first half of the first millennium B.C. There were two major traditions of deer stones, one associated with northern Mongolia and the Transbaykal, and the other associated with the Sayan- Altay region. Among the four stones given as examples (fig. 104), one is from Ushkiin-uver, in northern Mongolia; two of the other three come from Tuva (Turan and Sushin); and</page><page sequence="10">74 Mongolian Studies , 1993 although I cannot identify the fourth, its style places it within the Mongolian tradition. It is unfortunate that the treatment of these stelae is so slipshod, for they are a major element in any consideration of the continuity of Siberian monumental sculpture. Associated with them is yet another major tradition which has been ignored in this book: that of the great ritual mounds known as khereksur . Particularly within the region of northern Mongolia and Tuva, the khereksur refer to sculptural and architectural conceptions on a monumental scale, reminiscent of such sites as Stonehenge. The final section from this chapter - that on "Cults of Solar Animals, Vegetative Forces, and the Sacred Fire" - adds confusion to the discussion. A single example of a gold-wrapped bronze image from Tisul' cemetery becomes the basis for arguing that reindeer and gold indicate a solar cult. A stylized treatment of a reindeer's shoulder muscle becomes a wing (an interpretative error first propounded, unfortunately, in Okladnikov and Martynov 1972), and from that the reindeer becomes "winged" and "sky-climbing"; that despite the fact that a number of the "sky-climbing" deer on Mongolian deer stones ended by flying downward into the earth. (See, for example, stones from several sites in Arkhangai, in Volkov 1981: pls. 7/2, 8/3, 10, inter alia.) Mirrors become solar signs which carry the author to a discussion of mirrors in the Mediterranean world, mirrors in Buddhism and shamanism, and the mirror as an attribute of the Great Mother Goddess. Chariots transport us, also, to Egypt and the cult of Ra, and ultimately confront us with the fact that all these elements demonstrate "the deep genetic ties between Tagar bronze disks and world solar symbolization" (p. 71). Unfortunately, there is not a shred of evidence intrinsic to the Tagar culture to allow us to conclude that the mirror referred to the sun and thus indicates a solar cult. Nor can one find anything other than analogies to warrant the chapter's final conclusion, "All this indicates that the basic ideas of</page><page sequence="11">Review Article 75 Zoroastrianism were close to those of south Siberian people in the Scythic [sic] period and were diffused accordingly" (p. 73). Chapter 5, "The Steed Bears the Sun in (sic) its Hooves," deals with the art of the first millennium A.D., i.e. of what are here called the Hunnic and Turkic periods. In the first section, the author refers to something he calls "the Great Migration of Peoples" in northern Asia, but the dates that he gives for this event are various (compare pp. 1 and 74), as are the protagonists. Despite the fact that he had located the development of nomadism in the Bronze Age, the author associates with this Great Migration a changed "pattern of life . . . [i]t became mobile, as lifeways [sic] characterizing nomads unfolded" (p. 74). Curiously, while referring to populations and tribes, the author entirely omits any discussion of the emergence of confederations and states among, e.g., the Xiongnu and Yuezhi. Indeed, the earliest state formation is discussed here with reference to Turkic peoples of the mid-sixth c. A.D. - a period which he strangely refers to as ". . . heroic . . . with all its peculiarities" (p. 75). Martynov persists in using the outmoded term, "Hunnic," where the term, Xiongnu (Hsiung-nu) should be used in a Western translation. ("Hsiung Nu" is used only on p. 74, in referring to pottery from the Ivolga site in Transbaykal.) No clearer is the section devoted to "Art in the Hunnic (Tashtyk) Period . . " (pp. 77 ff.), particularly in relationship to the "Great Migration." At no point does the author indicate why the terms, Hunnic and Tashtyk, are apparently interchangeable (in fact, they are not, at least not in Western terminology). Indeed, the reader who is not familiar with Soviet studies of Tashtyk culture will be mystified by the scattered references to that culture, even in the context of the discussion of burial masks, which is in a separate section. Confusion is increased by the lack of guidance in these pages: in this plethora of "art," there is little attempt to discriminate between that which is craft (e.g., masks, simple pottery),</page><page sequence="12">76 Mongolian Studies , 1993 that which has pretensions to ornamentation but is highly conventionalized (e.g., Kulay and Relka bronze castings - which curiously represent a sudden lunge to Western Siberia for subject matter), and that which must be considered in terms of monumental expression (e.g., stone figures of the Turkic period). The discussion of rectangular belt-plaques makes no attempt to locate this tradition within a more ancient tradition of belt ornaments dating back to the Scytho- Siberians and certainly related to the costuming of horsemen. Nor does the discussion reflect the scholarship in the West and in China which has increasingly connected this tradition with the Xiongnu through provenanced materials rather than through the largely unprovenanced bronzes in Soviet collections (e.g., those from the Kosogol hoard). Throughout this chapter the reader is distracted by highly subjective judgments. For example, in the section on Tashtyk masks, attempts to explain them by analogy with modern ethnographic data lead to a highly questionable conclusion: that the masks functioned to isolate the dead from the living (p. 87). Confusion intrudes, also, into the discussion of the Turkic stone figures, images which occasionally achieve an undeniable expressive power. The term "balbal" refers not, as Martynov would have us believe, to the stone figures themselves but rather to the small stones which accompanied burial tumuli and ritual sites (see p. 97). This section on Turkic stone figures offers ample opportunity to connect the Turkic tradition with its deep-roots: the Okunev stelae (which he refers to only vaguely) and, more importantly, to the deer stones of the late Bronze and early Iron Ages. The author does not take advantage of that opportunity. In the last Chapter 6, "The Tree of Life," the author attempts to pull the material of the preceding pages together into a single all-encompassing theory. This theory appears to hold that a dominant mythological thread running</page><page sequence="13">Review Article Tl throughout the history of northern Asian art is the motif of the Tree of Life - as a tree, as a woman, or as a complex image. I believe that this theory has considerable validity. I must also agree with the author that the North Asian Tree of Life served as a metaphor for the concept of life and death, particularly in reference to a female body. But the demonstration of the manner in which these motifs worked themselves out over time and space is not helped by the kind of hodgepodge miscellanea one finds here. It is neither necessary nor helpful to turn to Egyptian traditions to explain what happened in North Asia. Nor is the discussion of the seated woman on the Pazyryk 5 hanging - one of the most important of the Siberian images - helped by the overblown interpretation one finds here: her simple dress ornament is turned into "boots or footprints . . . [which] reflect the arrival of a new season," and the triangular ornamentation on her headdress becomes "black and jagged like cultivated fields" (p. 102). Strangely, the same figure on unprovenanced gold plaques from the Treasure of Peter the Great is called a "clearly Europoid" male (pp. 102-103). For all the author's concern with female elements in Siberian prehistoric art, it is strange that he fails to refer to the petroglyphic bird-women of Kalbak-Tash (Gorno- Altayskaya AO) and Chuluut Gol (northern Mongolia). The maps included at the end offer a clear location of sites referred to in the text. The exception would be Map 6, the legend of which refers to "Sites Portraying Fertility" - which doesn't mean very much either in English or in terms of the text. The figures are, for the most part, clear and clean, but the problems of inconsistent labeling, mislabeling, or no labeling are too numerous to detail. A few may be mentioned here. The rubbings from the Shalobolin cliffs on the Yenisey River, (figs. 17 - 19, 53) are referred to A. I. Martynov. Yet all were first published in exactly the same manner in the book co-authored with the primary author, B. N. Piatkin (1985); the book itself is not listed in the</page><page sequence="14">78 Mongolian Studies , 1993 bibliography. The author likewise gives himself as source for figure 55 but this image was first published in Okladnikov 1980: pl. 11/4. Figures 62 - 65 of the so- called Okunev stelae include as apparent source "(Vadetskaya et al. 1980)" without indicating the figure numbers in that source. Figure 67 refers to a specific plate in "Vadetskaya 1967," as well as the general citation of "Vadetskaya et al. 1980." But figures 137 - 140, including eight other stones, refer to the source in terms of "(See also Vadetskaya 1967: fig )" when in fact each has been taken directly from drawings in Vadetskaya's (1980) book. The bibliography should be helpful to the non-initiated student of North Asian art, but its omissions are serious. Besides those already noted, one finds no mention of Rudenko's Frozen Tombs of Siberia (1970) or Jettmar's more general, Art of the Steppes (1964), two of the few excellent books written in English on this subject. Missing, also, is Novgorodova's Alte Kunst der Mongolei (1980) and - perhaps understandably - her Drevnyaya Mongoliya (1989). There is no understandable reason for omitting V. D. Kubarev's Drevnie izvayaniya Altaya (1979), on the deer stones of Gorno-Altayskaya AO, or his Drevnetyurkskie izvayaniya Altaya (1984), on the Turkic stones of the same region. Nothing is included of Savinov's serious contributions or of either Gryaznov's or Chlenova's studies of deer stones. Perhaps most astonishing is the omission of V. V. Volkov's fundamental study of Mongolian deerstones, Olennye kamni Mongolii (1981). The treatment of Mongolian material is especially unsatisfactory; e.g., figure 40 - "Ritual group of figures with birdlike hands, Mongolia. Unlocated. Eneolithic" - actually comes from Mt. Tebsh (Khobd Somon) (Okladnikov 1980: p. 37 and pl. 78/1). I have indicated the problems with the deer stones reproduced on figure 104. Figure 142, "The Tree of Life in the form of a ram. . . . penis ready for copulation. . . . Mongolian Scytho-Siberian," gives no provenance,</page><page sequence="15">Review Article 79 but it must have been taken from Okladnikov 1980: pl. 65/5, from Mt. Tebsh. Figure 143, lower right - one of several deer all said to be "Altay, primarily Yelangash. Scytho-Siberian . . . - actually comes from Mt. Tebsh in Gobi Altay (Okladnikov 1980: pl. 15/1.). Eccentricities and inconsistencies in terminology and capitalizations (or lower case letters) and errors in transliteration are too legion to detail. They make one wonder if there was any editorial scrutiny of this text at all. For example, one cannot refer to an "artistic (or stylistic) school" (10-11) in prehistoric art. At best one may speak of a tradition or style. Why "central" and "inner" Asia rather than the preferred Central Asia and Inner Asia? Why Gornyy Altay for the general region or mountains, and why translate "gorno[m] altay ae [sic] as "High Altay" (p. 282)? Why use "Scythic" when the traditional term in scholarly and popular literature would be "Scythian," or "of the Scythian period," or "Scytho-Siberian"? Why translate Zagadka zolotogo kurgana as "The mystery of the Golden Kurgan" (Chernikov 1965) and Naskal'nyye zagadki drevney Chukotki as "Puzzles on cliffs ...."? "Kurgan" in Artamonov's 1966 title is glossed as "remains," while in Devlet's 1964 title it is glossed as "Burial Mounds." Formozov's Ocherki po pervobytnomu iskusstvu would make more sense in English (and in this context) as "Essays on . . ." rather than "Sketches of . . ." (and see also under Iokhel'son). Why "south Siberia" throughout the text and "South Siberian" on p. 285? And so forth. No less unnerving are the stylistic awkwardnesses. "Moose cow" (p. 31) is usually referred to in English as a "cow moose." Why do the author and translator continually put terms in quotation marks, e.g., "ideoplastic," "Bushmen," "calling card," etc.? Small sculptures are "portable," not "mobile" (p. 22), unless, of course, they move under their own steam. Discordant language is</page><page sequence="16">80 Mongolian Studies , 1993 most distracting, unfortunately, when the book speaks of representations of animals and humans in copulation, e.g., pp. 31, 32, 40. For Mongolists, the book is particularly disappointing. Beyond the errors of fact relating to specific objects and sites, the book consistently lumps Mongolian traditions into those of the Transbaykal. It slights the great petroglyphic tradition of northern Mongolia - a tradition which is both distinctive from that of adjoining regions and yet indicative of the flow of cultures east and west, north and south, across the steppes, mountains, and deserts of Mongolia. It slights, also, the fascinating deer stone tradition; it ignores almost completely the extraordinary tradition of surface ritual structures used by both the Scytho-Siberians and by their Turkic successors.
