<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plato had stated that evil could not exist among the immortals, but was a necessary part of our mortal condition. Proclus' own treatment of the problem stands in the tradition that can be traced back from him via Salutios (De Dis et Mundo 12) to Iamblichus (De Mysteriis 4. 6; 10) and Porphyry (Ad Marcellam 24). The last two works display explicit dependence on Republic 617e. In other words they are all happy to attribute something of the cause of evil to the activity of the human will. Such a solution should be thought of as a compromise between the Plutarchian belief in the existence of an evil world soul (Moralia 1014e; 1015e = An. Proc. in Timaeo 6; 7) and on the other side the Plotinian refusal to believe that there could be any evil whatever in the spiritual sphere (cf. Ennead 1. 8. 6 and passim). Not that his view was without difficulties even within his own writing. Sometimes he seems to admit that the soul itself becomes somehow feeble and in so doing causes the existence of the matter which is the primary cause of evil (cf. the strange passage at the end of Ennead 1. 8. 14 with the two causal sequences there described). Proclus is unwilling to admit that there can be evil among either gods or heroes but from sections 20-25 he seems to admit that in some types of souls, which form a sort of midway existence between matter and the spiritual realm, there can be a sort of half-substantial evil, an 'idolum' (s. 25). Again in section 45 he discusses the nature of the 'anima kakergatis' and though he admits that it is not the sole cause of evils, he does assign to the debilitas of soul the partial cause of evil - a move that Plotinus, with his belief in the impassibility of the soul (cf. Ennead 3. 6. 1. 28), was unwilling to make. Proclus' account of evil is a mixture of Platonic and Stoic elements; for while by and large he takes the view of most Platonists that evil has existence, if at all, only in a very defective sense (cf. esp. sections 46-48), he also wants to argue that evil is somehow necessary for the harmony of the whole 'omnia utique ex providentia erunt, et malum habet locum in entibus.' (s. 61) - a Stoic argument. Is it possible to hold these two views consistently? Plotinus certainly does as a comparison of Ennead 1. 8. 3 and 3. 2. 6. shows; but it is not at all clear that such a position is really tenable. In other words a weakness of the book as an edition of what purports to be a philosopher is that it offers no assessment of the philosophical aspect of his writing. The book closes with a 'note additionnelle' by C. Steel, which is a collection of four fragments of Proclus, preserved in a tenth-century Byzantine florilegium under the name of Maximus. Of these four, three come from Proclus' Decem Dubitationes and one from his De Providentia. They provide evidence of the general accuracy of Moerbeka's translation.

(Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil.-hist. KI., 1981: 6.) Pp. 44. Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1981. Paper, DM. 28. This essay is the German original of The Augustine Lecture for 1980, delivered in English at Villanova University, Pennsylvania, and published there in 1981. The Augustine Lecture series, started in 1959, has made a major contribution to Augustinian studies, and the roll of its lecturers includes names like Paul Henry, John O'Meara, Vernon J. Bourke, H.-I. Marrou and Hilary Armstrong. Beierwaltes observes that the nature of happiness, so much discussed in Greek and Roman antiquity, is considered today, if at all, in the practical applications of psychology, sociology and politics. This is in marked contrast to Greek and Roman thought, in which the concept of happiness was a central issue. Accordingly, B. holds that to understand Augustine's thought regarding the beata vita, it is necessary to consider this notion as expressed by certain poets (Pindar, Euripides and Virgil) and, more importantly, by the philosophers. Here he sees two strains influencing Augustine: the Aristotelian, transmitted to Augustine by Cicero, in which happiness is found in contemplation of truth; and the Platonic, represented by Plato himself, Plotinus and Porphyry, in which happiness consists in the vision and comprehension of true Being and the ascent to the One. That this pagan classical tradition influenced Augustine's thought is not to be doubted; the effect of his youthful reading of Cicero's Hortensius, with its famous assertion: Beati certe omnes esse volumus (apud Aug., Trin. 13. 4. 7) and the equally powerful effect of studying the Neoplatonists at Milan in 386 and enjoying Plotinian mystical experiences there (Conf. 7. 10. 16; 17. 23) remained with him all his life. Nevertheless, Augustine radically 138 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">changed the Greco-Roman idea of happiness by defining it in, and confining it to, a Christian context: Deum qui habet beatus est (De Beata Vita 2. 11). Furthermore, man can only 'have' God by grace, through the mediation of Christ. If man, in his fallen condition, still has some sense of and desire for true happiness, it is because of God's initiative (De Trin. 4. 1. 2: ac per hoc egit nobiscum) and not because of any natural divinity in human nature. Furthermore Augustine, in contrast to much ancient thought, insists that true happiness is unobtainable in this life; we are happy in this world only in spe, not in re; and Augustine's definition of happiness in his letter to Proba: Ille igitur beatus est, qui omnia quae vult habet, nec aliquid vult quod non decet (Ep. 130. 5. 11) must be understood in an eschatological sense: Tunc erit vera vita post mortem, verumque solatium post desolationem (ibid., 2. 5). B. lists his conclusion about Augustine's view of happiness under five headings (pp. 23-43): (1) Augustine's idea of the happy life is characterised by its unlikeness to the life of the present world; (2) it consists in having God; (3) it pertains to the future, in the visio beatifica; (4) the manner of 'having' God is by loving: Beata quippe vita si non amatur, non habetur (Civ. Dei 14. 25); (5) the happy life is one of the highest spiritual and emotional intensity, but the emotion is always the result of the action of the Holy Spirit. Thus there can be no reduction of happiness to the level of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World: 'They get what they want, and they never want what they can't get'. Here, the author might have made more of the Augustinian notion of participation in God (briefly noticed on p. 35 in connexion with Trin. 4. 2.4: Illuminatio quippe nostra participatio Verbi est, illius scilicet vitae quae lux est hominum) and his doctrine of Deification (see Victorino Capanaga in Augustinus Magister II [1954], 745-54). This is an interesting essay. The style is, however, not an easy one for the foreign reader and English-speaking scholars may find it helpful to consult the translation in the Augustine Lecture.

London: The Warburg Institute, 1983 (1982 on title page). Paper, ?18. The Secret of Secrets, a Fiirstenspiegel enriched with occult speculation, is genetically connected with the ever productive genre of letters between Aristotle and Alexander. Hence its attribution to Aristotle. In itself it is of none but antiquarian interest. But its immense popularity in the Middle Ages and beyond claims the attention of the historian of literature and culture. The present tightly-packed and well-produced collection of articles on the Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, French, and Russian versions caters for most needs. Some Arabic version is first attested in 941. The work purports to have been translated into Arabic from classical Greek via Byzantine Greek or Syriac. But there is no need to believe in the existence of a Greek or Syriac original. The Arabic evidence is complex and confused. No major breakthrough has been made since Manzalaoui's comprehensive account in Oriens 23-24 (1974), 146-257. Oxford F. W. ZIMMERMANN A. WARDMAN: Religion and Statecraft among the Romans. Pp. vi + 217. London: Granada, 1982. ?12.50. The history of Roman religion used to be straightforward. Primitive Rome was marked by simple piety towards the gods of nature, an idyllic state of innocence which was shattered first by the importation of Hellenic, anthropomorphic deities with their alien mythology and then by the increasing interference of politics in the sphere of religion. By the late Republic religion counted for little; manipulation and scepticism were rife. The restoration by Augustus may have stemmed this melancholy decline temporarily, but state cults had little power under the empire. True religion lay in the personal cults of oriental origin and in Christianity. In the past twenty years a new wave of scholarly work has countered the traditional view at every stage. Notions of primitivism, decline, manipulation, scepticism and personal (as against collective) religion are now rightly viewed with suspicion.
