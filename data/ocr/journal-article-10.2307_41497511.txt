<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETARA, OR SEA DYAK GODS. 13 V The HEY. J. PEllHAM. ETARA, otherwise Betara, is, according to Maksdek, Sanskrit, and adopted into Malay from the Hindu ** &lt; system, and applied to various mythological person- ages; but whatever be its meaning and application in r Malay, in Sea Dyak - a language akin to Malay - it is the one word to denote Deity. Petara is God, and corresponds in idea to the Elohim of the Old Testament. But to elucidate the use of the term, we cannot turn to dictionary and treatises. There is no literature to wliicli we can appeal. The Sea Dyaks never had their language committed to writing before the Missionaries began to work amongst them. For our know- ledge of their belief, we lmve to depend upon what Individuals tell us, and upon what we can gather from various kinds of pen yap - long songs or recitations made at certain semi-sacred services, which are invocations tu supernatural powers. These aro handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth ; but only those who are curious and diligent enough, and have sufficiently capacious memories, are able to learn and repeat them ; and, as may be expected, in course of transmission from age to age, they undergo alteration, but mostly, I believe, in the way of addition. This tendency to change is evident from the fact that, in different tribes or clans, different renderings of the pengap, and different accounts of individual belief may be found. What follows in this Paper is gathered from the Balau and Saribus tribes of Dyaks. A very common statement of Dyaks, and one which may easily mislead those 4vho have only a superficial acquaintance with them and their thought, is that Petara is equivalent to Allah Taala, or</page><page sequence="2">134 PETABA, OB SEA D YAK GOBS. Tubati Allah . "What the Malays call Allah Taala , we call " Petara " is a very common saying. And it is true in so far as both mean Deity; but when we investigate the character repre- sented under these two terms, an immense difference will be found between them, as will appear in the sequel. "What Allah Taala is, we know ; what Petara is, I attempt to show. I have not unfrequently been told by Dyaks that there is only one Petara , but I believe the assertion was always made upon very little thought. The word itself does not help us to determine either for monotheism or for polytheism, because there are no distinct forms for singular and plural in Sea Dyak. To us the word looks like a singular noun, and this appearance may have suggested to some that Dyaks believe in a hierarchy of subordi- nate supernatural beings with one God- Petara - above all. I have been told, indeed, that, among the ancients, Petara Avas repre- sented as : - Patu y nadai ар a i Endang nadai iridai . An orphan, without father, Ever without mother. which would seem to imply an eternal unchangeable being, with- out beginning, without end. And this idea is perhaps slightly favoured by a passage in a pengap. In the song of the Head Feast, (*) tho general object of the recitation is to "fetch," that is, invoke the presence of, Singalang Burong at the feast, and certain messengers are lauded, who carry the invitation from the eartb to his abode in the skies. Now these are represented as passing on their way the house of Petara , who is described as an individual being, and who is requested to come to the feast. There may be here the relic of a belief in one God above all, and distinct from all ; but this belief, notwithstanding what an individual Dyak may occasionally say, must be pronounced to be now no longer really entertained. The general belief is that there are many Petaras; in fact, as many Petaras as men. Each man, they say, has his own peculiar Petara , his own tutelary Deity. "One man has one Petara , (l) Straits Asiatic Journal, No. 2, p. 123.</page><page sequence="3">PETABA, Oil SEA DYAK GODS. 135 " another man another" - Jai orang jai Petara . " A wretched man, a wretched Petara /' is a common expression which pro- fesses to give the reason why any particular Dyak is poor and miserable - " He is a miserable man, because his Petara is misera- ble." The rich and poor are credited with rich and poor Petaras respectively, hence the state of Dyak gods may be inferred from the varying outward circumstances of men below. At the begin- ning of the yearly farming operations, the Dyak will address the unseen powers thus : O hita Petara O hita Ini Inda - " O ye gods, " O ye Ini Inda У Of Ini Inda I have not been able to get any special account ; but from the use of Ini, grandmother, it evidently refers to female deities ; or it may be only another appellation of Kita Petara . Now, little as this is, it is unmis- takeable evidence that polytheism .must be regarded as the foundation of Sea Dyak religion. But the whole subject is one upon which the generality of Dyaks are very hazy, and not one of them, it may be, could give a connected and lucid account of their belief. They are not given to reasoning upon their traditions, and when an European brings the subject before them, they show a very decided unpreparedness. The use of the term Petara is sufficiently elastic to be applied to men. Not unfrequently have I heard them say of us white men : " They are Petara" Our superior knowledge and civilization are so far above their own level, that we appear to them to partake of the supernatural. It is possible, however, that this is merely a bit of flattery to white men. When I have remonstrated with them on this application of the term, they have explained that they only mean that we appear to manifest more of the power of Petara , that to themselves, in what we can do and teach, we are as gods. Mr. Low, in his paper on the Sultans of Bruni, (a) tells us that it was the title of the rulers of the ancient kingdoms of Menjapahit and Sulok. It is not uninteresting to compare with this the appli- cation of the Hebrew JSlohim to judges, as vice-gerents of Q-od. (Psalm LXXXTi. 6.) But some of the pengap will tell us more about Petara than can be got from the conversation of the natives, and the first (*) Straits Asiatic Journal, No. 5, pp. 1-16.</page><page sequence="4">136 PETABA, OH SEA D Y AK GODS. which I lay under contribution is the pengap of the Besant , a ceremony which is performed over children, and less frequently over invalids, for their recover}'. It is much in vogue amongst the Balaus, but seldom resorted to, I think, by the other clans of Sea Dyaks. Like all Dyak lore, it is prolix in the extreme, and deluged with meaningless verbosity. I only refer to such points in it as will illustrate my subject. The object of the Besant is to obtain the presence and assistance of all Petar as on behalf of the child - that he may become strong in body, skilful in work, successful in farming, brave in war, and long in life. This is about the sum total of the essential significa- tion of the ceremony. The performers are manangs, medicine men, who profess to have a special acquaintance with Petaras above, and with the secrets of Hades beneath, and to exercise a magic influence over all spirits and powers which produce disease among their countrymen. The performer then directs his song to the Petaras above, and implores them to look favourably upon the child. Somewhere at the commencement of the function, a sacri- fice is offered, when the Manangs sing as follows : - Raja Petara bla ngemata . Seragendah bla meda , Ngemeran l'a subai: tanah lang. Se ragend i bla Meda . Ngemeran ka ai mesei pul oli дгипонд sanggang. Seleledu bla meda , Удетегап ka jump» mesei jngu bejampong lempa ag. Seleleding bla meda , Ngemeran ha tinting Ivrus mematang.

From the Pleiades (l), like the glistening patterns of the long flowing turbans, looks also Petara Guyah . From the Milky Way (*), like golden rings of the nabau snake, Petara Radau is observing. From the rainbow (3) also, beautiful in dying like the feet of an opened box, Petara Menani is looking and bending. From the moon, like a fasting earring also, Petara Tebaran is looking. From the sun beautiful in setting, like the hanging segundi (*) of the manangs, our Petara is bending down. From the end of heaven, like the binding band of the tanggi , Petara Megit is looking. From the evening star as big as the bud of the red hibiscus. Petara Меди is looking. Odd and ludicrous as this is, in its comparison of great things with small, its teaching is very clear. As men have their personal tutelary deities, so have the different parts of the natural world. The soil, the hills, and the trees have their gods, through whose guardianship they produce their fruits. And the sun, moon, stars, and clouds are peopled with deities, whose favour is invoked, whoso look in itself is supposed to convey a blessing. But these Petaras are very human-like gods ; for they are re- presented as making answer to the supplications of the monangs - " How shall we not look after and guard the child, for next year (®) " you' will make us a grand feast of rice and pork, and fish, and " venison, cakes and drink : " - carnal gods delighting in a good feed, such as the Dyaks themselves keenly appreciate. In this way the attention of these Petaras is supposed to have been aroused, and a promise to undertake the child's welfare obtained. At this point, according to the assertions of the manangs, (x) Literally : " the many stars, " i.e., many in one cluster. (*) Literally : " the high ridges of long drought.

And so they wave the shadow of their magical influence upon the child. But there are still more Petaras to come : - Pupm Petara кеЪопд langit , Niu Petara pucholc Icaiyu. Having finished the Petaras in mid-heavens, We come to the Petaras of the tree-tops. And they sing of the gods inhabiting trees, and among these are monkeys, birds, and insects, or spirits of them. From the trees they come to the land P up us Petara pucholc Icaiyu, Nelah Petara tengali tanah. Having finished the Petaras of the tree-tops, We mention the Petaras in the midst of the earth. In this connection, many more Petaras are recounted. But the Besant tells something more than the number and names of gods. The whole function consists of two celebrations, the second of which takes place at an interval of a year, and sometimes more, after the first. In the first part, the Petaras are " brought " to some point in the firmament, or it may be, to some neighbouring hill, from which they see the child. In the second, they are " brought " to the house where the ceremony is being performed, in order to leave there the magic virtue of their presence. A large part of the incantation is the same in both ; and at a certain part of the second the Petaras are represented as saying : - " Before we have looked down, " Now a company of men are inviting us to the feast." And in compliance with the invitation, they prepare for the jour- ney earthwards. Ilio female Petaras are described, at great</page><page sequence="8">110 PETABA, OU SKA DYAK GOOS. length, as putting on their finest garments and most valuable orna- ments - brass rings round their bodies, necklaces of precious stones, earrings and head decorations, beads and hawkbells, and everything, in short, to delight feminine taste and beauty. Then the male Petara» do the same, and equip themselves with waist- cloth, coat and turban, and brass ornaments on arms and legs. A start is then made with several of the goddesses, renowned for their knowledge of the way as guides, to lead the way ; but these prove to be sadly at fault, for, after going some distance, they find tho road leads to nowhere, and they have to retrace their stops, and go by way of the sun and moon and stars ; and from the stars they get at some peculiar grassy spot, where they iind a trunk of a fallen tree down which they walk to our lower region*». Here they sing how these Petaras from the skies are joined by all the Petaras of the hills and trees and lowlands, and by Salampanäai : and then all together, in one motley company, they wend their way to tho house where the Bcsant is being made. Just as a Dyak would bathe after coming from a long walk, so these gods and goddesses are described as bathing, and their beauty desean ted upon. Their approach to tho house I pass over, but just before going up the ladder into it, the older Petaras think it necessary to give a moral admonition to the whole company : - Ka ahi rnmah anang meda ; Ünggai ka ngnmhai ngiga »trenti jani. Ka galenggang anang nentang ; Ünggai ka ngnmhai ngiga tv gang тапок la П. Ka ruai anang nampai; Ünggai ka ngnmhai ngiga lakL Ka hilik anang ntlik ; Ünggai ka ngnmhai ngiga tajan menyadi. Ka sadan anang ngilau ; Ünggai ka ngumhai ngiga padi . To the space under the house do not look ; Lest they should think you веек a pig's tusk. To the henroost do not sit opposite ; Lest they should think you soek a tail feather of the fighting cock.</page><page sequence="9">ť ET Alt A, Uli SEA DYAK UODS. 141 To the verandah do not cast your eye» ; Lest they should think you are seeking a husband. Into the room do not peep ; Lest they should think you are seeking a jar. To the attic do not look up ; Lest they should think you are seeking rice. After this they are supposed to enter the house, of course an invisible company ; and to partake of the good things of the feast together with the Dyaks, gods and men feeding together in har- mony. After all is over they return to their respective abodes. It is a miserable, low and earthly conception of God and gods ; hardly perhaps to be called belief in gods, but belief in beings just like themselves : yet they are supposed to be such as can bes- tow the highest blessings Dyaks naturally desire. The grosser the nature of a people, the grosser will be their conception of deities or deity. We can hardly expect a high and spiritual conception of deity from Dyaks in tlicir present intellectual condition and low civilization. Their 's is a conception which produces no noble aspi- rations, and has no power to raise the character ; yet it has a touch- ing interest for the Christian student, for it enshrines this great truth, that man needs intercommunion with the Deity in order to live a true life. The Dyak works this out in a way which most effectually appeals to his capacities and sympathies. I turn now to a zampi , an invocation often said at the commence- ment of the yearly rice-farming; in other words, a prayer to those superior powers which are supposed to preside over the growth of rice. First of all, Pulang Gana is invoked ; then the Sun, who is called Bain Patinggi Mata-ari , and his light-giving, heat-giving influence recounted in song. After the Sun comes a bird, the Kajira ; then the padi spirit ( Saniang Padi), then the sacred birds, that is, those whose flight and notes are observed as omens ; all these are prayed to give their presence. Leaving the birds, the performer comes to Petara " whom he also calls, whom he also " invokes." " What Petara it is asked, " do you invoke ? " The answer is : " Petara who cannot be empty-handed, who cannot bo •' barren, who cannot be wrong, who cannot bo unclean ; 99 and thereupon follow their names: - Sauggid Labong, Pinang fyong,</page><page sequence="10">142 PETABA, OU SEA BY AK Ci ODS.

And this call oř the sous of men is heard, and the Petaras make answer : " Be well and happy, ye " sons of men living in the world." " You give us rice, " You give us cakes ; " You give us rice-beer, " You give us spirit ; " You give us an offering, " You give us a spread. " If you farm, all alike shall get padi. " If you go to war, all alike shall get a head. " If you sleep, all alike shall have good dreams. " If you trade, all alike shall be skilful in selling. " In your hands, all alike shall be effective. " In just dealing, all alike shall have the same heart. " In discourse, all alike shall be skilful and connected. Then, leaving this company of Petaras , the sampi proceeds to invoke in a special manner one particular Petara , of whom more is said than of all the proceeding. This is Ini Andan Petara Buhan - Grandmother Andan , the grey-haired Pitara Her qua- lities are complete. " She has a coat for thunder and heat ; she " is strong against the lightning, and endures in the rain, and is " brave in the darkness. To cease working is impossible to lier. " In the house her hands are never idle, in talking her speech is " pure, her heart is full of understanding. And this is why she is " called, why she is beckoned to, why she is offered sacrifice, why " a feast is spread." She can communicate these powers to her servants. Moreover, they would obtain her assistance as being " the chief -keeper of the broad lands and immenses, where they " may farm and fill the padi bins ; the chief -keeper of the long " winding river, where they may beat the strong tuba root ; as " chief-keeper of the great rock, the parent stone, where they may " sharpon the steel-edged weapons ; as chief-keeper of the bee- " trees, where they may shake the sparks of the burning torches."</page><page sequence="11">PETARA, Oil SEA PYAK ÔOJ&gt;8. 14tf But to watch over the farm and guard it from evile is her special province ; and for this her presence is specially desired. " If the mpangau (г) should hover over it, let her shake at them " the sparks of fire. " If the Ъспдав (8) should approach, let her squeeze the juice " of the strong tuba root. " If the ants should come forth, let her rub it (the farm) with " a rag dipped in coal-tar. " If the locusts should run over it, let her douch them with oil " over a bottle full. " If the pigs should come near, let her set traps all day long. " If the deer should get near it, let her kill them with bamboo " spikes. " If the mouse-deer should have a look at it, let her set snares " all the day long. "'If the roe should step over it, let her set bamboo traps. " If the sparrows should peck at it, let her fetch a little gutta " of the tek along tree.; " If the monkeys should injure it, let her fix a rotan snare. " That there may be nothing to hurt it, nothing to interfere " with it." In answer to their entreaty, she replies in a similar way to the Petaras before mentioned, and pronounces upon them her blessings of success, prosperity and wealth, and skill, as a return for the offer- ing made to her. And thus the Dyak thinks to buy his padi crop from the powers above. Ini Andan, as she is preparing to take leave of her worshippers according to the »ampi, bestows some charms and magical medi- cines, mostly in the form of stones, and afterwards gives a part- ing exhortation : - " Hear my teaching, ye sons of men. " When you farm, be industrious in work. " When you sleep, do not be over-much slaves of the eyes. " When people assemble, do not forget to ask the news. Í1) A kind of bug. (2) A peculiar insect destructive to the young padi plants.</page><page sequence="12">144 PETABA, OR SFA DTÀK OODS. " Do not quarrel with others. " Do not give your friends had name». " Corrupt speech do not utter. " Do not be envious of one another. " And you will all alike get padi. " All alike be clean of heart. " All alike bo clever of speech. " I now make haste to return. " I use the wind as my ladder. " I go to the crashing whirlwind. ". I return to my country in the cloudy moon." Traditionary lore and popular thought thus tell the same tale ; the latter imagines the universe peopled with many gods, so that each man has his own guardian deity ; and the former professes to put before us who and what, at least, some of these are. The traces of a belief in the unity of deity referred to at the beginning of this paper, is at most but a faint echo of an ancient and purer faith ; a faith buried long ago in more earthly ideas. Yet even now Dyaks are met with who »ay that thore is only one Petara ; but when they are confronted with the teaching of the рещ/ар, and with unmistakeable assertions of gods many, they explain this unity as implying nothing more than a unity of origin. In the beginning of things there was one Petara just as there was one human being ; and this Petara , was the ancestor of a whole family of Petaras in heaven and earth, just as the first man was the anees- tor of the inhabitants of the world. But this unity of origin does not amount in their minds to a conception of a First Great Cause ; yet it is an echo of a belief which is still a silent witness to the One True God. It has been said that " every form of polytheism is sprung from -nature worship." It is very clear that Dyak gods are begotten of nature's manifold manifestations. Ini Andan seems a concrete expression of her generating producing power. The sun and moon, stars and clouds, the earth with its hills and trees and natural fertility, are all channels of beneficial influences to man, and the Dyak feels his dependence upon them ; he has to conduct his sim- ple farming subject to their operations ; his rice-crop depends</page><page sequence="13">PKTABA, OB SEA DYAK Ü0T&gt;S. 115 upon the weather, and upon freedom from many noxious pesta over which he feels little or no control - rats, locusts and insects innumerable ; he gets gain from the products of the junglo, and loves its fruits : high hills surrounded with floating clouds, and tlio violent thunder storms, are regarded with something of myste- rious awe ; ho must invoke these powers, for ho wants them to be on his side in the weary work of life's toils, and the struggle for existence ; and thus he imagines each phenomenon to be the work- ing of a god, and worships the gods ho has imagined. I must now refer to three beings which have been mentioned before, and which occupy a peculiar position in Dyak belief, as holding definite functions in the working of the world. Those arc Čalampandai , Pul any Gana , and fingala ng fínrong. Salampandai is a female spirit, and the maker of men, some say by her own independent power, some by command of Petara . The latter relate that iu the beginning Petara commanded her to make a man, and she made one of stone, but it could not speak and Petara refused to accept it. She set to work again and fashioned ono of iron, but neither could that speak, and но was rejected. The third time she made one of clay which had the power of speech, and Petara was pleased, and said : " Good is the man you have " made, let him be the ancestor of men." And so Salampandai ever afterwards formed human beings, and is forming them now, at her anvil in the unseen regions. Thero she hammers out children as they are born into tho world, and when each one is formed it is presented to Petara , who asks : " What would you like to handle " and use ?" If it answer : " The parang, the sword and spear," Petara pronounces it a boy ; but if it answer : " Cotton and the " spinning wheel," Petara pronounces it a female. Thus they are determined boys or girls according to their own choice. Another theory makes Petara the immediate creator of men, and of all things : - " Lang it Petara dula mihit, " Mesei dung gul тапок banda. " Tanah Petara diilu ngaga , " Metei huah mhateang hfonja.</page><page sequence="14">14G PKTA.ÎIA, 0« SEA. DTAlv 00|)Я. " Ai Petara dtilti ngiri , " Metei Unti tali betara. " Tanah lang Petara äulu nenchang , " Nyadi mensia . " Petara first stretched out the heavens, " As big as the comb of the red-feathered cock. " The earth Petara first created, " As big as the fruit of the horse mango. " The waters Petara first poured out, " As great as the strands of the rotan rope. " The stiff clay Petara first beat out, " And it became man." But here Petara may be any particular being, and may include a multitude of gods. There are other theories of creation or cos- mogony, but they cannot be examined here. There are no special observances in direct honour of Salampan- dai. In the Besant , she is brought to bo present along with the Petaras. But this great spirit, never, I presume, visible in her own person, is supposed to have a manifestation in the realm of visible things in a creature something like a frog, which is also called Salampandai. Naturally this creature is regarded with reverence, and must not be killed. If it goes up into a Dyak house, they offer it sacrifice, and let it go again, but it is very seldom- seen. It is one with the unseen spirit. The noise it makes is said to bo the sound of the spirit's hammer, as she works at her anvil. So intimate is the connection that what is attributed to the one, is also attributed to the other. The creature is sup- posed to be somewhere near the house, whenever a child is born : if it approaches from behind, they say the child will be girl ; if in front, a boy. In this case wo have an instance of direct nature worship, aud it is not the only one to be found amongst the Dyaks. Pulang Gana is the tutelary deity of the soil, the spirit presid- ing over the whole work of rice-farming. According to a myth handed down in some parts, he is of human parentage. Simpang - impang at her first accouchement bro^ht forth nothing but blood which was thrown away into a hole of the earth. This by some mystical means, became Pulang Gana, who therefore lives in the</page><page sequence="15">l'ETAHA, OU SKA D VAK GOD, S. 1 17 bowels of the carili, and has sovereign rights over it. Other offspring of Simpang-i mpang were ordinary human beings, who in со urso of time began to cut down the old jungle to make farms. On returning to their work of felling trees the second morning, they found that every tree which had been cut down the day before wa*, by some unknown means, set up again, and growing as firmly as ever. Again they worked with their axes, but on coming to the ground the third morning they found the same extraordinary phenomenon repeated. They then determined to watch during the following night, in order to discover, if possible, the cause of the mystery. Under cover of darkness Pui an g Gana came, and began to set the fallen trees upright as he had done before. They laid hold of him, and asked why he frustrated their labours. He replied : " Why do you wrong me, by not acknowledging my " authority ? I am Pulang Gana , your elder brother, who was " thrown into the earth, and now I hold dominion over it. Before " attempting to cut down the jungle, why did you not borrow the " land from me ? " " How ? " they asked. " By making me sacri- " fice and offering Hence, Dyaks say, arose the custom of sacri- ficing to Pulang Gana at the commencement of the yearly farming operations, a custom now universal among them. Sometimes these yearly sacrifices are accompanied by festivals held in his honour - the Gawei Batu , and the Gawei Bcnili , the Festival of the Whet- stones and the Festival of the Seed. In the Dyak mind, spirits aud magical virtues are largely associ- ated with stones. Any remarkable rock, especially if isolated in position, is almost sure to be the object of some kind of cultus. Small stones of many kinds are kept as charms, and I have known a common glass marble inwrought with various colours passed off as the " egg of a star," and so greatly valued as being an infalli- ble defence against disease, &amp;c. The whetstones, therefore, although made from a common sandstone rock, are things of some mysterious importance. They sharpen the chopper and the axe which have to clear the jungle and prepare the farm. There is something more than mere matter about them, and they must be blessed. At the Gawei Batu , the neighbours are assembled to wit- ness the ceremony and share in the feast, and the whetstones aro -arranged along the public verandah of the house, and the per-</page><page sequence="16">148 PETABA, Ott SEA DYAK ÛODS. former» go round and round them, chanting a request to Palang Gana for his presence and aid, and for good luck to the farm. The result is supposed to be that Pulang Gana comes up from hie sub- terranean abode to bestow his presence and occult influence, and a pig is then sacrificed to him. In the Gawei Benih, the proceed- ing is similar, but having the seed for its object. Pulang Gana is, therefore, an important power in Dyak belief, as upon his good-will is supposed to depend, in great measure, the etafE of life. Sing alang Burong must now be mentioned. His name probably means the Bird-Chief. Dyaks are great omen observers, and amongst the omens, the notes and flight of certain birds are the most important. These birds are regarded with reverence. On one occasion, when walking through the jungle, I shot one, a beau- tiful creature, and I asked a Dyak who was with me to carry it. He shrank from touching it with his fingers, and carefully wrap- ped it in leaves before carrying it. No doubt he regarded my act as somewhat impious. All the birds, to which this cultus is given, are supposed to be personifications and manifestations of the same number of beings in the spirit world, Which beings are the sons- in-law of Singalan g Burong (*). As spirits they exist in human form, but arc as swift in their movements íeis birds, thus uniting man and bird in one spirit-being. Singalang Burong , too, stands at the head of the Dyak pedigree. They trace their descent from him, either as a man who once Jived on the earth, or as a spirit. From him they learnt the system of omens, and through the spirit birds, his sons-in-law, he still communicates with his descendants. One of their festivals is called, " Giving the birds to eat, " that is, offering them a sacrifice. But further, Singalang Burong may be said to be the Sea Dyak god of war, and the guardian spirit of brave men. He delights in war, find head-taking is his glory. When Dyaks have obtained a head, either by fair means or foul, they make a grand sacrifice (i) It should be stated that Singalang Burong has his coun- terpart and manifestation in the world, in a fine white and brown hawk, which is called by his name.</page><page sequence="17">PETARA, OK SEA DYAK GODS. 149 au d feast ia his honour, and invoke hid presence. But it is un- necessary to enlarge upon this, for some account of the Mare of Sea Dyak mythology has already appeared in the Straits Asiatic Journal. (See No. 2.) Now, what with these beings, and with the Petaras , it is nc wonder that the Dyak, when brought face to face with his own confessions, acknowledges himself in utter confusion on the whole subject of the powers above him; that he owns to worshipping anything which is supposed to have power to help him or hurt him- God or spirit, ghost of man or beast - all are to be reverenced and propitiated. When inconsistencies in his belief are pointed out, all he says is, that he does not understand it, that he simply believes and practices what his forefathers have handed down te» him. But it is to be observed, as significant, that in sickness, or the near prospect of death, it is not Singnlang Burong, or Pulang Gamtr or Salampandai (which by the way are not commonly called Petara ) ; it is not Kìing ì or Bimgai, Nuiyiny, or any other mytho- logical hero that is thought of as the life-giver, but simply Petara, whatever may be the precise idea they attach to the term. The antu (spirit) indeed causes the sickness, and wants to kill, and so has to be scared away; but Petara is regarded as the saving power. If an invalid is apparently beyond all human skill, it i« Petara alone who can help him. If he dies, it is Petara who has allowed the life to pass away by not coming to the rescue. The Dyak may have groped about in a life-long polytheism, but some- thing like a feeling after the One True Unknown seemd to return at the close of the mortal pilgrimage. The only thing which implies the contrary, as far as I know, is, that very occasionally a function in honour of Singalang Burong has been held on behalf of a sick person, but it is exceedingly rare. Although the whole conception of Petara is far from an exalted one, yet it is good being. Except as far as causing or allowing human creatures to die may be regarded by them as signs of a malevolent disposition, no evil is attributed to Petara. It is a power altogether on the side of justice and right. The ordeal of diving is an appeal to Petara to declare for the innocent and overthrow the guilty. Petara " cannot be wrong, cannot be un-</page><page sequence="18">150 PETARA, OB SEA DYAK GODS. " clean." Petara approves of industry, of honesty, of parity of speech, of skill in word and work. Petara Ini Andan exhorts to " spread a mat for the traveller, to be quick in giving rice to the " hungry, not to be slow to give water to the thirsty, to joke with " those who have heaviness at heart, and to encourage with talk " the slow of speech; not to give the fingers to stealing, nor to " allow the heart to be bad." Immorality among the unmarried is supposed to bring a plague of rain upon the earth, as a punish- ment inflicted by Petara . It must be atoned for with sacrifice and fine. In a function which is sometimes held to procure fine weather, the excessive rain is represented as the result of the immorality of two young people. Petara is invoked, the offenders are banished from their home, and the bad weather is said to cease. Every district traversed by an adulterer is believed to be accursed of the gods until the proper sacrifice has been offered. Thus in general Petara is against man's sin ; but over and above moral offences they have invented many sins, which are simply the infringement of peínate, or tabu - things trifling and superstitious, yet they are supposed to expose the violators to the wrath of the gods, and prevent the bestowal of their gift ; and thus the whole subject of morality is. degraded and perverted. The prevailing idea Dyaks commonly entertain of Petara is thai of the preserver of men. In the song of the head feast, when the messengers, in going up to the skies to fetch Singalang Burong down, pass the house of Petara , they invite him to the feast, but he replies : " I cannot go down, for mankind would come to grief "in my absence. Even when 1 wink or go to bathe, they cut *' themselves, or fall down." Petara docs not leave his habitations, for he takes care of men, and so far as he fails in this, lie fails in his duty. So in an invocation said by the rnananys , when they wave the sacrificial fowl over the sick : - Lahoh eia un bui oh, Tangkap than dungan ; Antu hah munoh , Petara naroh ngembnan .</page><page sequence="19">PETABA, Oit SEA DYAK UODg. 151 Laboh dann biiloli, T angle ар than melasi: Antu hah ninnoli , Petara пдаки тепу adi.

Petaras are not worshipped in temples, nor through the medium of idols. Their idea of gods corresponds so closely to the idea of men, the one rising so little above the other, that probably they have never felt the necessity of representing Petara by any spe- cial material forni. Petara is their own shadow projected into the higher regions. Any conception men form of God must be more or less anthropomorphic, more especially the conception of the savage, lie "invests God with bodily attributes. As man's " knowledge chauges, his idea of God changes ; as he mounts li the scale of existeuce, his consciousness becomes clearer ami " more luminous, and his continual idealisation of his better sell " is an over improving reflex of the divine essence."
