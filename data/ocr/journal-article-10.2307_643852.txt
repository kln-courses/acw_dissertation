<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cheyenne names and cosmology JOHN H. MOORE-University of Oklahoma Tribal censuses are only now emerging as important sources of ethnological as well as demographic information (Moore 1980). Before such censuses can be used for scientific purposes, however, the ethnologist must understand the nature of the personal names that appear there and the anthroponymic principles that have been used within the culture to select these names rather than others. Before an ethnologist can successfully link names from census to census, or merge entries that are merely different translations of the same name, it is necessary to understand completely the cultural domains from which the names were taken. Although this article is mainly limited to anthroponymy, this kind of analysis is a necessary preliminary for any ethnographic use of census material. In the case of the Cheyenne Indians, names that appear on early reservation censuses are of two distinct types. The first type, which comprises the majority of names, merely con- sists of nicknames referring to body peculiarities or idiosyncratic behavior. Names of the second type, which are of interest for this article, are of a rather more serious nature. These are personal names taken from the spirits, birds, animals, and plants that are considered to be sources of power in major Cheyenne ceremonies. They are the cosmological entities called upon in prayer and ritual and are also the most prominent characters in sacred Cheyenne legends. It is my thesis that not only the kinds of names taken but also the distribution of names between men and women, the statistical frequencies of names, and the average ages of specific name-bearers, all reflect the most important principles of Cheyenne cosmology and ethnobiology. In fact, I argue that one can extract from the pattern of Cheyenne names not only the well-known cosmological principles but also other principles that are at best inexplicit in the ethnography. That is, anthroponymy not only enables one to verify the general structure of cosmology which has been elicited in the abstract from informants, but it also allows one to go beyond that and flesh out in detail the particular biological and spiritual characteristics important for understanding ceremonies and sacred traditions.1 Cheyenne personal names reflect the structure of formal cosmology, both in the kinds of names selected and their frequency of appearance. A quantitative and statistical analysis of the 1880 U.S. Census shows a congruence between ethno- biology and the sex and ages of name-bearers and confirms ethnographic asser- tions about naming and name changing from 1810 to the present.

The major influxes to the reservation had been in 1869, following the defeat of the Cheyenne militants at Summit Springs, and in 1876, after the military cam- paigns that followed Custer's defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn (Grinnell 1915). The last outbreak of the main body of Cheyennes was in 1874, and the last military campaign against a subgroup was in 1878, when the U.S. Army chased, imprisoned, and massacred a group of Northern Cheyennes who had escaped the reservation. A separate reservation was established in Montana for the Northern Cheyennes in 1884. In 1880 both the Northern and Southern Cheyennes were present on the reservation in Oklahoma Territory, although a few bands were living with the Arapahoes in Wyoming or with their Lakota allies in Dakota Territory. The main body of Cheyennes in this period re- mained in their traditional band structure, camped along the major streams of the reserva- tion, which was approximately 26,000 sq. km. At that time they were scarcely acculturated, since their only contacts with whites were at the Darlington Agency, where they drew ra- tions, or with passing cattlemen on the Chisholm and Western trails, from whom they ex- tracted "taxes" of beef. In 1880 they were still armed and still made extended trips off the reservation, hunting buffaloes and deer, with the permission of the Indian agent. All the Cheyennes listed in the census of 1880 lived in tepees, with large herds of horses. Their religious and political institutions were still intact. All were monolingual in Cheyenne, ex- cept for a few intermarried whites and mixed bloods, who served as interpreters for the army and the Indian Agency. The census of 1880 was unique in comprising several special questions for Indians prepared the previous year by the newly formed Bureau of American Ethnology (Judd 1967:3). These special inquiries concerned such matters as work roles, polygyny, size of ex- tended family, and housing. Also, an attempt was made to represent the Indian-language name in Roman orthography, as well as in translated form.2 For the Cheyennes, the census questionnaire was administered by the appointed enumerator, J. A. Covington, assisted by the interpreter Robert Bent.3 Covington was the assigned farmer-in-charge at the Darling- ton Agency in Oklahoma, while Bent was a mixed-blood bilingual, a descendant of the trader William Bent (Hyde 1968). Covington and Bent had been personally instructed in their duties by R. S. Packard, the special agent entrusted with the Indian censuses in Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arizona. Packard had been appointed by J. W. Powell, the first director of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Of the people involved in the Cheyenne census, only Bent spoke Cheyenne. The Southern Cheyenne schedules surviving from the 1880 census are incomplete, com- prising only 1456 of the approximately 2100 persons noted on other administrative lists of the same period. Fortunately, however, the 1880 census was enumerated by household, so that the surviving 262 household schedules are apparently not biased demographically; whole households are missing, not individuals of a particular age or sex. Whether these schedules were biased sociologically in favor of certain clans or bands has been deter- mined by finding the locations of the allotments taken by 1880 household heads during the 1892 land selection. Figure 1 indicates that the surviving household schedules represent all of the Southern Cheyenne residence groups previously reported (Moore 1980). Since the Northern Cheyennes were not allotted until 1928, the same method cannot be.used to check representation of the northern bands. However, nine Northern Cheyennes who elected to take allotments in Oklahoma in 1892 are in fact represented on the census list, implying that the Northern as well as the Southern Cheyenne bands are included in the 292 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1. Locations of individual allotments of 1880 family heads plotted as dots on allotment blocks of the various Cheyenne bands of 1892. sample. Apparently, then, we are dealing with personal names carried by members of 262 households, representing 378 total Cheyenne households present in Oklahoma Territory in 1880. The census names are recorded both in English and in Cheyenne. The identities of the clerks who recorded the names in Cheyenne are not preserved among the original documents. The census was taken in the time before Mennonite missionaries had standard- ized Cheyenne orthography, and the system used in 1880 was apparently ad hoc. I am unaware of any other examples of the same orthography. There did exist at that time a guideline for writing vowels, prepared for the Office of Indian Affairs (Schoolcraft 1859, 111:446-459). There is no indication on the census listings, however, that this guideline was used. In transcribing census names, the clerk was greatly influenced by English spelling. K, S, and C, for example, are used for /k/ and /s/ depending on the English word that sounded similar to the clerk. Concerning /kl, C is used for Cowmin, but K for Kicheh. For Is/, C is used for Cinnamook, but S for Sissevehim. The clerk even incorporated a silent K in Kneenon. Also, the clerk did not always spell the same name the same way, apparently forgetting previous transcriptions. Although Inehuss (Sparrow Hawk) is spelled the same way in 13 of 16 examples, Sistoenow (Long Chin) is spelled Cistoenah on the same page. Despite these problems of transcription and orthography, Cheyenne bilinguals assisting in this project were able to verify the Cheyenne names of all but 16 adults appearing on the list. In addition to the variability created by the clerk, some dialect differences were observed. In particular, those Cheyennes representing the incorporated Sutai tribe tended Cheyenne names and cosmology 293</page><page sequence="4">to delete some /kl sounds, to substitute /ks/ for Its/, and to modify vowels in certain en- vironments. For purposes of analysis, all the names from the census are given a standard- ized spelling, using the system devised by Petter (1913-15). Although his system is im- perfect, it is familiar to Cheyennes literate in their own language, including the people assisting with this project. A name dictionary was created with a standard spelling refer- enced to all observed variants. the cosmology Explicit cosmological information is usually communicated in Cheyenne society during the course of the major ceremonies. The "pledger" of a ceremony takes the role of student to an established priest who becomes the "instructor." During the months of preparation and the days of the actual performance of the ceremony, the pledger learns various prayers, songs, and rituals which incorporate different aspects of the formal cosmology. For example, the various sectors of the universe and the various taxa of plants and animals are regularly addressed as part of the rituals and prayers. The existence of these ritual taxa provides a rather unique opportunity for creating a comprehensive taxonomy, since they in- clude "intermediate" categories frequently missing from folk taxonomies (Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven 1973:216). The ethnobiology described here incorporates these in- termediate taxa using Linnaean terms (order, family) as a heuristic convenience. As an anthropologist, I learned cosmology in a somewhat different manner from a Cheyenne pledger. Because there have been many non-Cheyennes who have wanted to learn rituals and prayers for commercial reasons or merely out of curiosity, ritual instruc- tion has become a rather sensitive matter (Powell 1969). Therefore, I tried to make clear to informants that my interests were more scholarly and secular. My original questions in 1970 focused on the published but unexplained body paints illustrated in Dorsey's (1905) classic book on the Sun Dance. As I learned more, I asked limited, specific questions about am- biguous or unelaborated parts ot the cosmology. Although I tried not to elicit any rituals, songs, or prayers that were private or sacred, these were nonetheless frequently given to me. Ironically, I probably learned much more about ceremonial matters by my real disinterest than others have learned by wheedling and misrepresentation. For some purposes it is fortunate that I collected the major structure of formal cosmology and published it before any census names were examined. This helped to pre- vent any unconscious manipulation of the major categories to fit the data. Most of my fieldwork in cosmology was undertaken in the summers of 1970 and 1971, when several senior Arrow Priests and Sun Dance Priests served as informants. A rough version of formal cosmology is presented in Moore (1974) and is summarized by Hoebel (1978). It was not until 1977 that I took an interest in censuses and began to make an- throponymic inquiries, working back and forth among dictionaries, censuses, and infor- mants. The unfortunate part of having done my cosmological fieldwork seven years earlier is that several of the priests and elders who had supplied the best symbological information had since died-Alex Brady, Albert Tall Bull, and James Medicine Elk-so I could not pose to them the many etymological questions that arose from an examination of census names. As a result, there are some etymological questions that might well remain unanswered forever. For example, it would be useful to know what the Cheyenne names Feathered Wolf or Bear Above mean, in a symbolic sense. Several prominent bird and animal species also have been avoided as sources of names, and no living informant can tell me why. Happily, however, other questions of equal significance have been convincingly answered by modern informants, once the inquiries were properly phrased. My primary etymological in- 294 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="5">formants for present research have been Edward Red Hat, the Keeper of the Sacred Arrows (1899-1982), his wife Minnie Red Hat (born 1909), Katie Osage (born 1893), Roy Bull Coming (born 1914), Roy Nightwalker (born 1919), and John Greany (born 1918). Ethnographic data used here but not cited is from my own fieldwork since 1970. For purposes of analysis, picture the Cheyenne universe as arranged along a vertical axis and two horizontal axes, each perpendicular to the others. The vertical axis is our main con- cern for ethnobiology and anthroponymy (Figure 2). At the top of the vertical axis, the zenith within Otatavoom is the spiritual domain of Maheo, the All-Father, while the nadir within Nsthoaman embodies the female principle, Heestoz. The female principle is em- phatically not spiritual, however, for the vertical dialectic of cosmology is played out be- tween spirit/maleness at the zenith and matter/femaleness at the nadir. The Cheyenne theory of conception illustrates this dialectic by asserting that a baby's body is from its mother but its spirit and animation are from the father. An energy theory also is part of this dialectic, as energy is said to be transferred from male to female during sexual intercourse, bringing the inert fetus to life. Women are said to be excited after coitus, while men are tired and depleted. The spatial zones between zenith and nadir are tiered (Kesby 1979:39-42), and all witness, in various ways, the interaction between male energy and female substance. Male energy is manifested through such spiritual entities as Atovsz the Sun, Nemevota the Rain, Nonoma the Thunder, and Vovetas the Tornado. The material manifestations of female- ness include not only the sterile Deep Earth, Nsthoaman, but also the zone of fertile soil, O TAESEHE ESEHE Blue Sky-Space OTATAVOOM Nearer Sky-Space SETOVOOM ^ ^/ ~ ^^^^ Atmosphere / &gt;^ ~~TAXTAVOOM VOTOS TOOM FigurDeep Eart h NSTHOAMAN N Figure 2. The vertical axis of Cheyenne cosmology. Cheyenne names and cosmology 295</page><page sequence="6">Votostoom. All the cosmological zones pictured from zenith to nadir, then, represent dif- ferent kinds of struggles between male and female principles. Heestoz is exclusively pres- ent only in the Deep Earth, but the soil, plants from the soil, and animals that live in caves also represent the domination of the female principle over male spirituality. Maleness dominates, however, among animals of the surface, more so among birds, and most of all among the anthropomorphic spirits of meteorological and astronomical events. The Cheyenne names of the zones of the vertical universe and literal translations of the names are noted in Figure 2. All entities of the universe, then, except Maheo (all spirit) and Nsthoaman (all matter or substance) represent some organic composition of spirituality and substance. Entities within the zones are entitled to more or less respect and entreatment depending on how much spirit and how much substance they embody. The entities in the higher tiers are more sacred and holier than those in lower tiers. A tornado, for example, demands a great deal of respect because it originates in Otatavoom and is nearly all energy and very little substance. A stone, by contrast, is not prayed to for spiritual power because it exhibits very little life, by Cheyenne standards, and is mostly substance. I do not discuss here the horizontal axes of the universe-the cardinal directions- because these are not clearly related to the names I examine. Explicitly, the directions are more related to colors, social structure, and personal ritual paraphernalia than to the sorts of symbolic entities used for names. Also, the symbols related to the cardinal directions are more ambiguous than those of the vertical axis, because the spirits of the directions are associated with social groups-bands and clans-which differ in their interpretations of the symbols. The vertical axis, however, tends to embody the high cosmology, which is col- lective and is endorsed by everyone who attends the major ceremonies. Most names of cosmological significance in Cheyenne society are drawn from the birds and animals that occupy the various cosmic zones on the vertical axis. In addition to being defined by their location in the tiered zones, they are also defined by reference to a story called "The Great Race." This is a teaching story told to youngsters and is not part of the major ceremonies. Although there are many variations of the story, all contain the basic idea that once the prey animals-buffalo, elk, antelope, deer, and so on-were predators (Grinnel 1926:252-254; Kroeber 1900:161-163; Randolph 1937:189-192). At that time, these animals would organize themselves into hunting parties and seek to kill and eat the other animals-people, wolves, coyotes, bears, badgers-and also the birds. Finally, a great council was held at which it was decided that all creatures would organize themselves into two teams for a race. The members of the winning team would henceforth eat the members of the losing team. The favorite in the race was a female buffalo named Slim Walking Woman, although it was thought that the falcon also had a chance.4 People were organized into the same team as the birds and canines, and they all painted their faces with earthen colors (the coot painted his nose white, the flicker painted his temples red, the eagle painted his mouth black, and so on). When the race started, the female buffalo leaped to the front, where she was challenged successively by various birds and animals. (When the story is told in Cheyenne, all the birds and animals are identified and their markings are explained at great length.) Especially the falcon challenged her closely but died from the effort and fell to earth, blood streaming from his mouth. Then the flicker challenged, but he too fell aside, bleeding. At last there was only the buffalo and the magpie, who had started far behind. As these two approached the finish line, the magpie pressed hard upon the buffalo, so that finally the buffalo, too, spent all her energy and fell dead, staining the earth with her blood. The magpie won, and since that time people and their allies have eaten the game animals. 296 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="7">The paints applied for the race became permanent. Animals that can be eaten-game animals-have no paint. Although some elements of this story are variable among different storytellers, other elements are consistently the same. The game animals are the same in all versions, as are the identities of the birds who allied themselves with the people. The most variable characters, however, are the coyotes, who are cast as umpires in some versions. Entirely missing from some versions are bears, badgers, and eagles. Wolves are always cast as close allies of people and are said to paint. Generally speaking, then, those creatures that are sources of power are the ones who painted themselves for the great race. Many war paints and ceremonial paints of the Cheyennes are patterned after these creatures. By reference to Figure 2, we can locate most of them in the Sky-Spaces as creatures we would call birds, with some exceptions. Some other of the creatures who painted themselves are located on the earth's surface, such as wolves, badgers, and lizards. Those birds who did not paint, however, and were therefore not the allies of the Cheyennes, can be eaten, such as gadwalls, turkeys, and prairie chickens. One way of looking at the situation, then, is that birds and animals with camouflage or protective coloration are considered edible by Cheyennes, but brightly col- ored creatures are not. Figure 3 represents the general taxonomy of Cheyenne birds and animals and can be understood either by ethnobiological criteria such as color or by reference to the tiered cosmology of Figure 2. Although the members of each taxon share definitive UNIQUE KINGDOM ORDER FAMILY GENUS SPECIES KIND BEGINNER maheonevekseo nizeo maxevekseo - aeno _4aenohes zeevseossomo- tomevo -maevc vekseohes xamaevekseo - mahpevekseo hoevekseo honehe manston emhoneheo - hokom nako hovan - voae zehetaeametanevos vaoseva -~~~~_ nn?~~mevavovan - moehe hotoa zeevasohoeva - veshovan esevon _ moksa mehe xamaehestan votostotaneo hestohestan zeamevoneso zeevasomapeva hoxzz zehoneo moez Figure 3. Biological taxa significant for Cheyenne names. Cheyenne names and cosmology 297</page><page sequence="8">characteristics, any taxon can also be defined by its presence in a particular tier of the universe. The maxevekseo, for example, can be defined either as birds of prey or as the birds of Setovoom. The taxon zeevassohoeva can be defined roughly either as mammals or as comprising those species resident in the surface dome, Votostoom. Put another way, the spatial and definitional categories are mostly coterminous. For anthroponymic purposes it is not necessary to understand Cheyenne ethnobiology in great detail (see Moore 1983). Figure 3 only illustrates those taxa that represent three or more personal names from the 1880 census; that is, the descending taxonomy has been ter- minated at this level of significance. Plant names, for example, are all considered together, despite the fact that Cheyennes recognize over 100 food and medicinal plant species. However, there are only 11 people named after plants on the 1880 census, with no species represented more than twice. In some cases I have sorted out a significant taxon at a lower level while leaving the other members at a higher level. Maevecess (Cardinal), for example, is the name of 10 people from the census, although none of the other species of vekseo (small birds) are represented by more than two names. Therefore, all vekseo except car- dinals are grouped together for analysis. Although Cheyenne ethnobiology furnished most of the names from the formal cosmology, other names are derived from sacred entities not included among birds, plants, and animals. Anthropomorphic spirits, meteorological phenomena, and the Deep Earth all provided many people with personal names and are included in this analysis. Missing from both the ethnobiology and the cosmology are the domestic animals-horses, dogs, and ox- en-although 28 people had these kinds of names in 1880. These animals are technically "unaffiliated" because they are considered to be entirely mundane and not worthy of ritual attention (Raven, Berlin, and Breedlove 1971:1210). They are excluded from analysis here because informants were reluctant to place domestic animals within any cosmological tier. All the other species represented in Figure 3 are part of the structure of formal cosmology. The most general biological term, or "unique beginner," is expressed in the ceremonial category zehetaeametanenevoss ("all living things"). Plants and animals both have collo- quial translations in Cheyenne, zehoneo and manston, respectively. The two major orders or "intermediate" taxa of manston are the zeevseossomotomeva ("flying creatures") and the zeevassohoeva ("ground creatures"). Of equal rank taxonomically, although not spiritually, are the zeamevoneso ("crawling creatures") and the zeevassomapeva ("water creatures"). These last two orders contain some monsters and disgusting creatures-creatures occupying the lower tiers-and so are more loosely linked with the general category of "all living beings." The former two orders, however, are mentioned fre- quently in songs and prayers. The flying creatures are divided into three "families," another "intermediate" taxonomic level: the maheonevekseo ("holy birds"), the maxevekseo ("great birds"), and the xamaevekseo ("common birds"). The maheonevekseo are defined as those birds that can penetrate Otatavoom to give messages to the anthropomorphic spirits at the zenith. Without giving their special attributes, I shall simply list these holy birds as the thunder- birds, magpies, crows/ravens, flickers, dragonflies, and butterflies. The maxevekseo, roughly speaking, are the carniverous birds that mostly populate Setovoom. The nizeo are the eagles, although Cheyennes recognize four distinct eagle species which would be subsumed under the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in the Linnaean system. Other large raptors are also listed as eagles by Cheyennes, but I shall list all per- sonal names derived from eagles (there are only five of them) in the figures and accompa- nying table under the single taxon nizeo, without specifying what kinds of eagles. The eagles, along with the hawks (aenoo), populate Setovoom, the nearer Sky-Space. The hawk species that have names in Cheyenne are the usual falconinae and buteoninae of the 298 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="9">Plains, as well as Circus Cyaneus (the marsh hawk). For purposes of statistical analysis I have separated only the aenohes (sparrow hawk) from the rest of the hawks because 16 males had this name. Eleven other males were named after other kinds of hawks, all listed under the morpheme representing the genus aenoo. From the family xamaevekseo I have only isolated the species maevecess (cardinal) from the genus vekseohes (small birds). For the balance of personal names drawn from birds in the 1880 census, no single species of xamaevekseo was mentioned more than twice. Mahpevekseo is the genus of water birds and hoevekseo the ground birds or game birds mentioned before. The order of surface animals (zeevassohoeva) comprises two families. For a long time, I resisted ethnocentrically the idea that human beings (votostotaneo) belonged to this order, but there are three reasons why humans must be included at this level. First, this inclusion of humans is a very consistent response from modern informants, especially those who are non-Christians. I find a very strong correlation between aboriginal beliefs in general and the belief that humans belong in a taxonomy of animals. Second, unless humans are included in the taxonomy, the taxon of surface animals does not bifurcate at this level. We would have an order, zeevassohoeva, with only one family, hovan, which would be very unusual for a folk taxonomy. Third, the most consistent theme in Cheyenne religion is the quest for power by human beings, who entreat animals, birds, and spirits that have more power than they do. Considering humans to be surface animals places them in the correct cosmological position for their religious function. Concerning the significance of taxa for names, it is reassuring to note that Cheyennes took names from other human nations in the same way they took names from birds and animals. Although some people, such as Pawnee Woman, were so called because they were adopted, most male Cheyennes bearing such names were merely "named after" other nations, in the same way they were named after wolves and hawks. The family hovan contains three significant genera, the emhoneheo (predatory mam- mals), the mevavovan (game animals), and the veshovan (small animals). The difference be- tween emhoneheo and veshovan, on the one hand, and mevavovan, on the other, is a matter of painting. Of the emhoneheo, wolves especially are said to exhibit individual war paints, just like human warriors. The veshovan contains brightly colored animals such as lizards and ground squirrels, some of which are used for religious or medicinal purposes. Two seemingly anomalous members of game or nonpainting taxons are skunks and pronghorn antelopes, both of which are brightly marked. Cheyennes say, however, that all skunks paint the same and all antelopes paint the same, and so they are game rather than sacred animals. It is the perceived variability within the species that is important for the taxonomy, as well as the contrast or brightness of appearance. Since so many personal names are derived from the hovan, I have separated most of them by species (see Table 1). Buffaloes, however, which have received a lot of cultural at- tention, contributed four morphemes to the construction of personal names, listed in the last column. All the terms are anthroponymically significant and were separated for statistical analysis. The votostotaneo are sorted only by genera, since there are fewer names of this kind (drawn from other nations of humans). The two human genera are the xamaehestan (literally, "natural people" or Indians), a category that contains the con- tiguous tribes known to Cheyennes, and the hestohestan ("foreign people"), which includes all Europeans as well as Negroes, Mexicans, Pueblo Indians, and Orientals. The last two orders of animals are not very important for Cheyenne names or cosmology, so I mention them only briefly. The order zeamevoneso ("crawling creatures") includes snakes, spiders, insects, scorpions, earthworms, and so on. None of these creatures are con- sidered edible or sources of power; neither are the "water creatures" (below). The only Cheyenne names and cosmology 299</page><page sequence="10">Table 1.

The zeevasso'mapeva ("water creatures") contains supernatural as well as natural species. Among the natural species are fish, alligators, salamanders, frogs, and turtles, but not quadrapedal terrestrial reptiles such as tortoises and lizards. Tortoises and lizards are veshovan. Several other general categories of birds and animals in Cheyenne cosmology pertain to geographical or ecological zones. Some prayers refer to the creatures of the forests or of the plains, or to winter creatures or summer creatures. These categories entirely overlap the taxonomy shown in Figure 3, however; no new species are introduced as part of the geographical taxonomy. naming practices Ruth Benedict's (1922) classic article has probably contributed greatly to the myth that male names among Plains Indians are created anew e3ch generation by vision quests. However, modern Cheyennes tell us, and the early censuses confirm, that the huge majori- ty of personal names, both male and female, are inherited. In both cases the names come from the father's side, although there could be special reasons for taking a matrilateral name. Boys and girls, however, were named in rather different manners. At birth, girls usually received the name that they would carry throughout their lives, ac- cording to the ethnography and to modern informants. If a baby girl were sick, however, she could be named temporarily after some important religious entity, such as Sun or Thunder. Compared with male names, there are fewer names for females, which means that many women carry the same name. On the 1880 census, for example, of 721 female names, Little Woman appears 35 times; Fan Woman, 20; and Big Belly Woman, 14. By con- trast, the most frequent male name, Roman Nose, appears only 9 times among 735 males. A baby boy's name was usually given very tentatively. He was given either his permanent name, from an agnate, or a nickname such as My Old Pot, Horse Feces, Our Doggie, Worm, Tremendous Warrior, or Howling All Night. If an infant boy was sick, he was immediately given the name of an important ancestor to protect him. At some point, especially if a boy did something commendable, he was given the patrilateral name. In some cases, the nickname was carried on. New names were generated among Cheyenne men either by carrying on a nickname or by a religious experience. If a boy was healthy and admirable while he carried the nickname, then the name would probably not be changed. Especially if a boy went to war with a nickname and was successful, it would certainly not be changed unless the young man was very ambitious and sought a higher-status name. The young man nicknamed Cometsevah ("withered leg"), for example, was a successful warrior and became a tribal chief, so his name was passed on to his descendants in a respectful manner. It may very well be that all the names on the 1880 census derived from body parts or behavior-which is to say the ma- jority of names-are merely nicknames of people who became prominent, whose names were carried on by their descendants. New male names could also be inaugurated by religious quests, traumas, and warfare. Only a small number of Cheyenne men ever undertook vision quests, or do so today, and these are usually men going to war, or Indian doctors or priests. For the Cheyennes, these quests do not necessarily result in taking a new name, although they might. It is equally likely that a vision quest would inspire a man to take an ancestor's name. Nevertheless, new names taken from birds and animals, according to modern informants, are always the result of a religious experience. Cheyenne names and cosmology 301</page><page sequence="12">These religious experiences also can be a part of illness or trauma. A delerious man might see a wolf, eagle, or buffalo who promises to help him. When the man recovers, he can take a name that describes his religious experience directly or indirectly. A direct name would be Firewolf; an indirect one, He Who Appeared. Women can also take such names upon recovering from an illness, including difficulty in childbirth. Those so recovered can become medicine people and treat others who have the same illness or difficulty. People who are lost or starving can also have involuntary religious experiences that result in a new name. Cheyenne folklore is full of such stories. Witnessing some amazing in- cident might result in a new name as well. A courageous warrior who performed miraculous feats might be renamed Man With A Club or Pawnee Killer. A woman who skinned an albino buffalo with no ill effects might be called White Buffalo Woman. Frequently, men take additional names or discard old names for new ones. A man who is respected and generous, or has a good war record, might take a name in addition to his present one. His family would still refer to him by his old name, but those outside the fami- ly would use the new name, to show their respect. Old names were discarded only if the person bearing the name had bad luck, or was mean or ill. A troublesome person might be urged to take a new name by his embarrassed relatives. Even today, alcoholics and an- tisocial men are urged to pledge a major ceremony and take a new name. It is the tradi- tional privilege of the pledger to announce a new name, usually from an ancestor, as part of the ceremony. According to modern informants, names drawn from birds and animals are not distributed randomly in the population. Not only particular species but larger taxa tend to be localized among related people. For example, two families5 in Oklahoma and three in Montana take their serious names from birds of prey, the maxevekseo. The similarity of names is a result, in great part, of the role of priests and medicine men as name-changers for their families. In his role as instructor, an elder directs his novices toward new names that are taxonomically related to other names in the family. A man named Sparrow Hawk, for example, would be more likely to take the new name Swift Hawk than Buffalo Bull or Bear Man. Buffalo names or bear names tend to be located in other families (Moore 1974:231-269). This localization of names within the family is also the result of a priest or medicine man's specialized knowledge about the living world. Each practitioner attempts to under- stand only one segment of the biological universe, for example, buffaloes or songbirds. Such elders also defer to one another, in modern times, about the significance of special markings or behavior of birds and animals, or the medicinal properties of plants. One con- sequence of this, for ethnological fieldwork, is that many different people must be inter- viewed to build up a comprehensive picture of ethnobiology. Each religious or medical practitioner is only on intimate terms with one or two taxa of the biological universe. These are the names he taps for use within his own family. From the various aspects of naming discussed here, we can create certain expectations about names as they appear on the 1880 census. First, since the high god is Maheo, the All- Father, and since the female principle, Heestoz, is located at the nadir, we might expect that men's names, on average, will be drawn from the higher tiers of cosmology. That is, we can predict that men will tend to have bird's names, for example, while women will have animal names. Concerning children's names, we can predict that girls' names will not differ very much from women's names, since women are said not to change their names very fre- quently. Concerning name changes, we can predict that older men will have names taken from birds and animals of higher cosmological rank than younger men, reflecting their par- ticipation in rituals and ceremonies. We might also expect, based on the ethnography, that 302 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="13">the extremely sacred names-Sun, Holy Birds and so on-will be borne either by old men or by children who have been given sacred names to safeguard or to cure them. We would not expect elderly women to have sacred names; nor would we expect that women's names would show any evidence of changing. the census names From the total of 735 males and 721 females appearing on the surviving census schedules, 258 males and 223 females had names drawn from high cosmology. The other names were apparently nicknames, either new ones carried by children or old nicknames that have become part of the cultural inventory. All nicknames are excluded from analysis. Generally speaking, despite several attempts, no patterns could be observed among these names.6 It may well be that modern researchers cannot distinguish between some traditional significata and denotata and that some names of cosmological significance have been er- roneously discarded (Morris 1971:93-96). During the course of this research, several ap- parent omissions of this sort were discovered. For example, the name One Feather refers to a chief and should be translated as Chief Man. Sharp Nose, translated literally on the census, should be translated instead as Porcupine. Similarly, Shaved One and Shave Tail should be translated as Opossum. It may be that some discarded "nicknames" were in fact the names for birds, animals, plants, or spirits, but were not recognized as such by modern bilinguals. Although the 1880 census contains both Cheyenne and English versions of each personal name, the English version is frequently in error. In a very few cases the English name bears no relationship whatever to the Cheyenne name. This probably represents people with multiple names having been unable to translate one successfully and, with the assistance of the interpreter, giving the clerk a translation of a different name. Some of the names are so complex in translation that they invite such substitution, names such as Her Mother Hit Her Over The Small Of Her Back, His Grandfather Owned A Grey Horse, Woman Who Is A Member Of A Group Of Other Women, and Cloud Coming That Looks Like A Man Riding A Horse. This last name is translated on the 1880 census simply (and inaccurately) as Man Alights On A Cloud. All of these names are very short and simple in Cheyenne, because of the parsimony of Cheyenne infixes. Some of the names are more specific in English than they are in Cheyenne. Frequently the identity of a bird or animal is only implicit in Cheyenne but is made explicit in English. For example, many women whose names are translated with Buffalo as a component do not have any morphemes for buffalo in their Cheyenne names. Nevertheless, it was under- stood in the family, and it is understood by modern informants, that the name referred to a buffalo. On the 1880 census we have Buffalo Shaving Woman, although the Cheyenne ver- sion only says (literally) The Woman Shaved It. All such personal names that are indefinite in Cheyenne but definite in English are included in the cosmological sample. Certain problems of translation and classification have been faced within each cosmological category. In particular, there are some "customary mistranslations" that must be taken into account. These mistranslations began in early reservation times and in some cases have been carried on to the present. Maevecess (cardinal) is almost always translated as "robin" by Cheyennes; many Cheyennes have believed that this is the proper English name for the bird. "Snipe" is another customary mistranslation, this time for the Long-Billed Curlew. The most serious misunderstanding between Cheyennes and clerks, however, was the translation Bald Eagle for Turkey Vulture. What the Cheyennes meant Cheyenne names and cosmology 303</page><page sequence="14">was a large eaglelike bird, except it had no feathers on its head. The real Bald Eagle (voaxa in Cheyenne) is usually translated merely as Eagle or White Eagle on the censuses. Among the mammals, coyotes and wolves were problematic for Cheyennes and clerks. About half the time, wolves (honehe) were translated as coyotes, while about one-sixth of the coyotes (hokom) were translated as wolves. For purposes of analysis, the Cheyenne ver- sions of wolf and coyote names are used, rather than the erroneous translations. For all the entries in Table 1, reference is made to the morphemes of the native language wherever possible. The lowercase entries in the first column show the morphemes that were used to compile the statistics in the other columns; if the listed morpheme appears in the personal name, that name is included in the sample. In those cases where more than one cosmological morpheme appears in a name, the noun morpheme rather than the modi- fying morpheme prevails. For example, Porcupine Bear is included as a bear, since Por- cupine is in a modifier position in the personal name. There are very few such names listed in the census. Ethnobiological categories that incorporate more than one analytic mor- pheme are capitalized in Table 1. These are the same taxonomic categories that appear in Figure 3. In addition, one cosmological category has been added at the bottom, for earth names, and three at the top, for sacred entities of the Blue Sky-Space. All the categories of Table 1 are ranked, from bottom to top, according to their position in the formal cosmology. This order has been established entirely by informants, with the more spiritual and male entities toward the top and the more material and female entities toward the bottom. The numerical values assigned are entirely arbitrary. One integer of dif- ference is placed between each adjoining taxon, but this is a meaningless quantity. One might just as easily place three integers between them, or variable quantities to indicate more or less taxonomic distance. For example, a value of 7 might be placed between the highest animal and the lowest bird, but only a value of 1 between sparrow hawk and hawk. Assigning differing values would be no less arbitrary, however, and would not be necessary for the limited purposes ranking serves in this analysis. The rank-order values are used here only in a comparative manner, to show some extremely general characteristics of the sam- ple. Although they are used as independent variables in the regressions to follow, they are shown as ordinal values, reflecting the orientation of the cosmology. statistical results Figure 4 plots the mean ages of all males and females, categorized by personal names of cosmological significance. Age is the abscissa (x-coordinate) and the rank order of the cosmological entities is the ordinate (y-coordinate). Also plotted are mean age and mean rank for all males (19.8, 16.1) and all females (22.2,11.6). As expected, the results show that men tended to take higher-rank names than females. In fact, no women took certain predatory bird and animal names. However, the results do not show, as expected, that older men in general tended to have higher-ranking names than younger men. When a regression of age with respect to rank is calculated for males, the resulting line on Figure 4 is nearly vertical and is statistically indistinguishable from the equivalent plot for women. An inspection of the specific means for each plotted taxon indicates that what is not true for the whole sample might very well be true for certain domains within the sample. The clearest case is for the "birds who paint," ranked 20 through 26 on Figure 4. These are birds used for healing, for ceremonies, and for war medicines, and there seems to be a correla- tion between their rank and the ages of the name-bearers. Figure 5 is a more detailed plot of males listed in the 1880 census who bore the names of "birds who paint." There is clearly a correlation between the rank or sanctity of the name 304 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="15">30 29 28 + 27 * 26 1 4 25 24 23 22 21 * 4 Order 16 15 14 + 13 12 , l mean 11 10 9 * e 8 7 A 4 6 5 4 3 2 ? 1 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Mean Ages Figure 4. Mean ages of males and females bearing name roots from Table 1 (females are crossed dots; male and female regression lines are nearly vertical). and the seniority of the individual bearing it. The characteristics of the regression line describing the correlation are included on the figure, with increments of ten on the or- dinate. Not only the mean age for each name should be observed but also the range of the name. A plot that included the oldest member of each name group would show an even more significant correlation than is shown by considering all members. Several other features of the "birds who paint" plot and regression should be mentioned. First, the higher taxa have fewer members-13 "small birds" but only 5 "holy birds." One reason for this may be the circumlocution employed for sacred names, resulting in their be- ing discarded from the cosmological sample as mere "nicknames." For example, names such as That One, He Who Is Over There, or Above Us might well refer to eagles or to holy birds but have no recognizable morphemes that would cause us to place the names in the cosmological sample. Second, boys who begin life with low-ranking bird names might later take high-ranking coyote or bull names rather than bird names. We can see from Figure 4 that names derived from small birds are rivaled only by small animal and calf names as having a low mean age of bearers. Third, there may have been fewer total middle-aged men in the population because of recent warfare. The general demography of the Cheyennes argues against this hypothesis, however, since the population pyramid of the Cheyennes shows no imbalance of sex or age caused by the Indian Wars. Either Cheyenne casualties were much less than reported by the U.S. Army or else Cheyenne women and children suf- Cheyenne names and cosmology 305</page><page sequence="16">Maheonevekseo 70 Nizeo 60 */ -aeno- 50 * * * * /0 Aenohes 40 * * * * * y= 2.2x +2.4 n:64 Maevecess 30 ..... / * Vekseohes 20 **. * ..

Figure 6 shows the means for individuals from the 1880 census who had buffalo names; it also shows the regression for all such name-bearers with respect to rank of the names. In this case, however, data for both males and females are plotted, with the mathematical ex- pressions of the regression lines entered on the figure. Rather unexpectedly, the females also show a correlation between age and rank. However, the characteristics of the lines are different because the males and females differ significantly in the number of individuals bearing the three kinds of names. Even more surprising is Figure 7. This plot includes all ethnobiological categories from the surface dome downward. We see an inverse correlation between rank of name and the mean ages of females bearing names from this domain, the lower end of the cosmological axis. The line clearly indicates that women tended to take names from the lower and more female categories as they got older, despite the fact that name changing among women is scarcely mentioned in the ethnography. But these data show the practice to have been significant for women, at least for the women in the sample. The same regression was at- 306 american ethnologist * *</page><page sequence="17">Y=1.36x-11.82 -mehe- 20 n=51 * n=4 Y = 1.25 x-11.18 -moksa- 10 n=8 n=10 0 10 20 30 40 50 Age Figure 6. Regression of x with respect to y for individuals bearing buffalo names, sorted by sex (only means are plotted). tempted for men with these kinds of names, with the insignificant results also shown in the figure. The difference between the kinds of names taken by men and women in Cheyenne soci- ety is shown more clearly in Figure 8. To devise the figure a pair of sexual indices was developed for each name. Each index was calculated as the proportion of name-bearers of one sex, multiplied by the mean age of persons of that sex bearing the name. For example, if 4 of 12 "mooses" were males, with a mean age of 20, then the index would be .25 times 20, or 5. The female index for "mooses," if their mean age were 10, would be .75 times 10, or 7.5. Each index represents the cultural significance of the name, relative to the sexes. The indices reflect both the extent to which the name belongs exclusively to one sex and the age-and, we assume, the social importance of people bearing that name. Figure 8 plots one sexual index versus the other for all personal names drawn from the formal cosmology. The exclusively male names appear on the y-axis while the exclusively female names appear on the x-axis, both with zero as one Cartesian value. The names clustered in the center are about equally male and female, with the distance from the origin indicating the mean ages of the name-bearers. The dashed lines on Figure 8 are drawn to separate the name clusters into three groups. The top sector includes the em- phatically male names, the bottom sector the female names, while the central sector in- cludes the names that are not exclusively male or female, according to the calculated in- dices. In the top sector the index of maleness for the name Antelope is probably misleading, because of sample size (there are only three male Antelopes and one female; see Table 1). With a larger sample size, one might predict that antelope names would cluster with elk names, since they are both members of the same taxon, mevavovan. The same might be said of Deer, represented in this sample by only three persons, all males. Of the three animals, the sexual indices of the elk names are probably the most reliable, representing 26 persons. Of the other names in the male sector, bull names seem predictably arranged with respect to cow and calf names. The calf morpheme, which is not inherently specific for sex, is in the neutral sector, while the sexually specific terms for bull and cow are in their proper Cheyenne names and cosmology n= 23 - hotoa - 30 n=6 307</page><page sequence="18">Zeamevoneso Y =149x - 2928 n=23 Zeevasomaoeva 40 \ Hoxzz 30 y= -2.6x + 74.3 Moez 20 7 / n= 35 -navo- 10 0 10 20 30 Age Figure 7. Regression of x with respect to y for individuals bearing biological names from the earth's surface, sorted by sex (only means are plotted). places. Several other names in the neutral sector require further explanation, however. The indices for Bear place it in the neutral zone, away from the other members of the taxon emhoneheo. This probably reflects some word play in Cheyenne between the words for bear and for mother. Many modern bilinguals pronounce the two words the same way-nako-although older people put a vowel contrast on the first syllable. The similarity in the words has probably led to bear names being more frequent for women than one might otherwise expect. The names drawn from especially sacred entities of cosmology-spirits and holy birds-all suffer from small sample size, as can be seen in Table 1. In addition, they exhibit wide ranges in age for name-bearers, as can be inferred from the large standard deviations in Table 1 -which can be predicted from naming practices because sick infants were said to have been given these kinds of names, sometimes by elders who also bore the names. The large standard deviation thus confirms the ethnography. The name Lightning is special. It deviates in its index from the other "holy" names in be- ing very female and showing a standard deviation of only 11.76 for a sample of 9 females. Here, again, modern informants say that the reason for the unexpected femaleness of the name is etymological. In Cheyenne, an observed bolt of lightning is said to be "grounding" itself, just as one says in English that an electrical circuit is "grounded."

It should be noted that Thunder (nonoma), which has no female connotations to its etymology, is clustered wiot other names that are neutral in their indices. Cheyenne names and cosmology 309</page><page sequence="20">conclusions In general, this analysis confirms ethnographic observations concerning Cheyenne cosmology and naming practices. Men listed in the 1880 census did indeed tend to take names from the ascendant part of the cosmology, while women's names tended to repre- sent entities closer to the nadir. In addition, a plot of sexual indices for Cheyenne names shows three clusters of names-one male, one female, and one neutral, with some excep- tional cases as noted. Concerning name changes, the analysis cannot confirm a correlation in the whole sample of males between age of name-bearer and rank of name-entity. Within domains, however, such as "birds who paint" or "buffaloes," a correlation is shown to exist between the maleness of names, as represented by the rank order, and the mean ages of the name-bearers. Among women, a positive correlation is shown to exist in buffalo names between the rank order of the names and the mean age of the name-bearers, just as for men. Quite unex- pectedly, however, a negative correlation is demonstrated for the lower part of the cosmological axis, between rank order of names and mean ages of name-bearers. Put another way, it is shown that older women in this domain tended to have names that were more emphatically female than names taken by younger women. From a female stand- point, these names might have been regarded as higher status than the names from the bird and animal kingdoms. These concluding remarks would be incomplete without mentioning an ethnographic follow-up to the suggestion that older women tended to change their names to entities that were more female. This follow-up was made necessary by the fact that classic Cheyenne ethnography, like most ethnography of that period, suffers from a preoccupation with males and male activities. Very few of the articles and books written about Cheyennes con- tain much about the institutions of women. However, there are suggestions in the ethnography that older women could be elected "women chiefs" because of their par- ticipation in what were called "quilling societies" (Grinnell 1962:159-169; Marriott 1956). Also, my own informants continually have directed my attention toward the importance of decorated "woman sticks" carried by elderly women as emblems of domestic authority. These sticks are clearly in evidence from early reservation photographs of elderly women. These suggestions led me in the summer of 1982 to make direct inquiries about whether name changes had anything to do with these women's institutions. I was told that when a woman was elected leader of a "quilling society" or participated in a major role in the tribal ceremonies, she too had the option of taking a new name. Also, any respectable woman, after menopause, could announce a name change and the taking of a "woman's stick" at a tribal gathering. If no one challenged her generosity and fidelity to her husband, she could thereafter take up the decorated walking stick, could smoke a pipe, and was known by a new name. The decorated stick, although only 1.0 to 1.3 m long, is symbolic of the digging sticks used by women in aboriginal times both to farm and to collect wild plant food, especially prairie turnips and Jerusalem artichokes.7 This analysis of the 1880 census suggests that these new names were taken from cosmological entities closer to the Deep Earth and to the female principle, Heestoz. notes Acknowledgments.

Rodolphe Petter, the manuscript dictionaries of John Smith, Lt. Creel, and Albert Gatschet, and the field notes and correspondence of James Mooney, George Grinnell, George Hyde, and George Bent. Lt. Heber Creel's dictionary is preserved in the Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Bent-Grinnell-Hyde correspondence is scattered among the Coe Collection, Yale University Library; the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles; and the Denver Public Library, Western History Department. Petter's annotated dictionary is in the Newberry Library, Chicago. The dic- tionaries of Smith and Gatschet, the field notes of Mooney, and some of Grinnell's correspondence are located in the Smithsonian Anthropological Archives, Washington, DC. 2 Census schedules consulted are the originals held by the Indian Archives Division of the Oklahoma Historical Society in Oklahoma City, entitled "Tenth Census of the United States, Indian Division, Cheyenne Tribe, 1881." 3 The arrangements for the census are discussed in the correspondence files of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Agency, Oklahoma Historical Society. 4 When the story is told in Cheyenne, female particles are usually suffixed to the identities of the losing racers, while male particles are affixed to the winning individuals. 5 A "family" to modern Cheyennes is equivalent to the traditional vestoz (local band), in practice about 50 people. 6 Frequencies of name by sex were plotted against the natural symbols associated with the semicar- dinal directions. No regularities were discovered except for color. Male nicknames beginning with G: Going After, Going Fast, Going Through, Going Behind, Going Long Distance, Going South, Good Walker, and Good Blanket, Good Voice, Greasy Legs, Greasy Nose, and Grey Head. Female nicknames beginning with B: Big Belly Woman, Big Foot, Big Woman, Bitter Woman, Blind Woman, Blood Woman, Braiding Woman, Brass Earring Woman, Bright Woman, Broad Face, and Broken Back Woman. 7 Decorated digging sticks are pictured in photograph #48 of the Shuck Collection and photograph #46 of the Munger Collection, Western History Photo Archives, University of Oklahoma. Digging sticks are also pictured in photographs #13630 and #13547 of the Grinnell Collection at the Museum of the American Indian, New York City. references cited Benedict, Ruth 1922 The Vision in Plains Culture.
