Despite more than a century of control and eradication efforts, the fly remains widely distributed across Africa and coextensive with other prevalent diseases. Control and planning are hampered by spatially and temporally variant vector distributions, ecologically irrelevant boundaries, and neglect. Tsetse are particularly well suited to move into previously disease-free areas under climate change scenarios, placing unprepared populations at risk. Here we present the modeling framework ATcast, which combines a dynamically downscaled regional climate model with a temporally and spatially dynamic species distribution model to predict tsetse populations over space and time. These modeled results are integrated with Kenyan population data to predict, for the period 2050 to 2059, exposure potential to tsetse and, by association, sleeping sickness and nagana across Kenya.

African trypanosomiasis (AT), a neglected trop ical disease, is a zoonotic, parasitic infection of wildlife, domesticated animals, and humans. Its causative agents (parasites of the Trypanosoma brucei species complex) are transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly (genus Glossina). Approximately 8.5 million km2 in thirty-seven sub-Saharan Africa countries are infested with tsetse (Allsopp 2001), resulting in approximately 70 million people with exposure risk (World Health Organization [WHO] 2010). Two major epidemics oc curred in the first half of the twentieth century, one between 1896 and 1906 and the other in 1920 (WHO 2010). By the mid-1960s, human African trypanoso miasis (HAT) appeared to be under control. By the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 102(5) 2012, pp. 1038-1048 © 2012 by Association of American Geographers Initial submission, December 2010; revised submission, July 2011; final acceptance, August 2011 Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, LLC.</page><page sequence="2">Climate Change and Risk Projection 1039 mid-1970s, however, HAT reemerged due to a break down in surveillance and control programs com pounded by drug resistance, genetic changes in the par asite, civil conflict, and anthropogenic (land use and cover changes) and natural (climate) environmental change. In the mid-1990s it was estimated that at least 300,000 cases were underreported due to lack of surveil lance capabilities, diagnostic expertise, and health care access (WHO 2010). In response to these limitations, the WHO, with public and private partnerships, initi ated a new surveillance and elimination program, under which approximately 25,000 new cases were reported with an annual estimated rate of 50,000 to 70,000 cases (Weekly Epidemiological Record 2006). In 2010, the number of reported human cases of the disease dropped to 7,131, leading some to hope for eventual complete control of the human disease complex (WHO 2011). The disease is also considered one of the most impor tant economically debilitating diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, with animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) re ducing livestock productivity by 20 percent to 40 per cent in tsetse areas (Hursey 2001). In Kenya, where agriculture accounts for roughly a quarter of gross do mestic product, the economic burden of African try panosomiasis is acutely felt at both local and national scales (Bourn et al. 2001). We hypothesize that climate change and anthro pogenic activity combine to modify the environment to enhance or degrade habitat suitability for tsetse. We know that tsetse occupy environmental niches in Kenya that, based on existing biophysical data, they should not, and we know that tsetse are missing from areas in Kenya where they should exist in large and stable populations. These findings make cost effective surveillance, control, and intervention efforts extremely difficult and traditional epidemiological pre diction almost impossible. Many studies of tsetse exist (cf. Welburn, Maudlin, and Simarro 2009), but there are no disease vector studies that integrate fundamental niche models, species movement models, and climate change data. Some studies for other vectors have shown promise (i.e., Peterson [2009] for malaria; Gonzalez et al. [2010] for leishmaniasis), but validation is largely limited to existing data sets (Kulkarni, Desrochers, and Kerr 2010) and often only linked to temporally static, biophysical variables. Although consistently reported to be important, few studies have empirically linked human activities, ecological stressors, vector responses, and disease emergence interacting at multiple spatio temporal scales. In response, we quantify systematically the space-time distribution of tsetse across Kenya and deterministically predict the changing tsetse distributions expected to emerge with a changing climate. Future tsetse distributions are then placed and discussed within the social framework of Kenya. Tsetse Control Today, the international public health strategy for many vector-borne diseases has changed from eradi cation to ecological perspective vector control (Torr, Hargrove, and Vale 2005; Ferguson et al. 2010). A wide variety of techniques exist to control tsetse popula tions, including insecticide spraying, wild host culling, and land cover modification. The combination of in effective application, emergent resistance, and envi ronmental concerns, however, motivated the search for alternative strategies (Grant 2001). The sterile in sect technique, one such alternative that has received widespread publicity for controlling tsetse in Zanzibar, has been ineffective in other locations. Anthropogenic landscape modification (autonomous control) involves the removal of tsetse habitat through the natural expan sion of human settlement and cropland. This indirect method of control is the most effective and least ex pensive of the land clearing methods; however, it is difficult to quantify the extent to which tsetse habi tat is reduced and it is not a practical policy solution (Bourn et al. 2001). The most frequently used eco logically friendly techniques are point-source control methods, which attract the flies with a combination of visual and odor cues to traps or targets (Leak, Ejigu, and Vreysen 2008). Although cost effective, widespread im plementation of point-source control methods has been difficult and never effective over the long term. In East Africa, governments generally lack the infrastructure to manage and sustain the traps over large, diffuse af fected areas and often situate traps or targets with only anecdotal evidence of tsetse presence (Hide 1999). Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis in Kenya Eight species of tsetse are found in Kenya, cover ing roughly 25 percent of Kenya's land area, includ ing 60 percent of productive rangeland. Tsetse occupy diverse habitats in distinct "fly belts": the North and South belts near Mt. Kenya, the South Rift, Lake Vic toria basin, Central Kenya, Trans Mara-Narok, and the Coastal belts. These belts are infested with one or more tsetse species with distributional limits that are set by intersections of physical, biological, and anthropogenic boundaries (Ford 1971). The most common habitats</page><page sequence="3">1040 Messina et al. Figure 1. The African Trypanosomia sis Forecasting System (ATcast) mod eling framework.

Typical environmental limits for tsetse are day temperatures below 17°C and above 36°C, annual rainfall less than 300 mm, and lack of suitable resting sites (Jordan 1986; Terblanche et al. 2008). Different tsetse fly species can coexist in the same areas, making it difficult to assess quickly the causative agent in human or animal epi demics (Hide 1999). Tsetse flies are one of the few insect K-strategists, with long life expectancy (average of ninety days per female), high survival rates (&gt;90 percent daily survivorship in adults), and low repro duction rates of one live pupa deposited in a suitable soil every six to nine days. The tsetse fly vector carries the parasites to different animal hosts, allowing cycli cal transmission, but the primary animal reservoirs are wild ungulates and domestic cattle. Humans might also contribute to the reservoir pool (WHO 2010), and both animals and humans contribute to Trypanosoma genetic exchange (Hide 1999). Taxonomically, tsetse exist as three distinct clades. We focus on the morsitans or sa vannah group. Methods Our modeling environment, ATcast (for African Trypanosomiasis Forecasting System), is an integrated space-time projection ecological model (Figure 1). The Tsetse Ecological Distribution (TED) model (DeVisser et al. 2010), a spatially explicit dynamic subcompo nent of ATcast, predicts tsetse distributions at 250 m spatial and sixteen-day temporal resolution and can be described in two parts: (1) a spatially explicit fun damental niche model that identifies suitable tsetse habitat and (2) a fly movement model that integrates tsetse distributions and fly movement rates. The fun damental niche model uses four Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data sets: (1) the MODIS Terra Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Vegetation Indices 250 m V005 (MOD13Q1) product as a surrogate for available moisture (Williams et al. 1992), (2) the MODIS Terra Day Land Surface Temperature (LST) 1 km V005 product (MOD11A2), (3) the MODIS Terra Night LST 1 km V005 product (MOD11A2), and (4) the 1 km MODIS type 1 Global Land Cover product. Each of the four data sets is classi fied to a suitable versus unsuitable habitat classification scheme and combined to create a tsetse fundamental niche map every sixteen days. Temperature, moisture, and land cover parameterizations vary by species, but here are set for G. morsitans, commonly known as the woody savannah species and the most spatially exten sive tsetse in Kenya (Bourn et al. 2001). Habitat suitability alone is a poor predictor of tsetse presence, so a fly movement model was developed to identify potential tsetse distributions within the funda mental niche. The fly movement model does not predict</page><page sequence="4">Climate Change and Risk Projection 1041 Figure 2.

The location of several of the largest cities and district boundaries are included as indicators of higher hu man population densities. (Color figure available online.) the movement rates of individuals but rather models tsetse distributions as a dynamic population-scale "fly front" (Hargrove 2000). If ecologically suitable tsetse habitat predicted by the fundamental niche model is encountered by the expanded tsetse distributions, then tsetse are allowed to persist in that location. This results in individual binary presence-absence maps at sixteen day intervals, from 1 January 2001 to the acquisition date of the most recently available MODIS data prod ucts used in the model (here 15 October 2010). The probability of tsetse presence is the product of the sum of the binary distribution maps divided by the total number of scenes. The maximum extent of tsetse dis tributions is also produced and identifies any cells in which tsetse were predicted present during the time period analyzed (Figure 2). The formal validation of the TED model is presented in DeVisser et al. (2010). Figure 3 is the limiting variable map constructed by us ing one landscape variable (i.e., day LST, night LST, NDVI, or Land Cover) at a time to model sensitivity of the tsetse fundamental niche. The maximum extents of tsetse distributions were then calculated for each of the four maps and compared to the normal TED model maximum extent map, identifying locations where one or more landscape variables are limiting tsetse distribu tions. The limiting variable map helps identify those areas immediately susceptible to change (Figure 3). For example, if under a future climate scenario mois ture were to increase, these areas might become suit able for tsetse. Alternatively, areas where land cover is the limiting variable would likely become suitable if the land was abandoned. The minimum and maximum</page><page sequence="5">1042 Messina et al.

Combination classes indicate locations where more than one variable limits tsetse distributions (e.g., moisture + maximum temperature predicted to be both too hot and too dry at some point in the year for tsetse distributions to persist). The tsetse present &gt;10% class indicates the locations where the TED model percentage probability map pre dicts a greater than 10 percent probabil ity of tsetse always being present. (Color figure available online.) temperature limiting variables are explicitly modeled in the following climate projection section. To model climate change, we loosely coupled the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) version 4-4 (Cotton et al. 2003) with TED. The RAMS model is a state-of-the-art atmospheric model that nu merically solves the fully compressible nonhydrostatic equations described by Tripoli and Cotton (1982) and captures exchanges of heat, momentum, and radiation between the surface and atmosphere. The modeled spa tial extent spanned Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi and the vertical domain had thirty-three levels stretching to 32,581 m high. Surface and vegeta tion dynamics were governed by the LEAF-2 submodel (Walko et al. 2000). Land cover was taken from Tor bick et al. (2006) with land cover parameters including albedo and fractional cover linked to appropriate global land cover classes. The RAMS parameterization was similar to that described in Moore et al. (2010), which documents extensive validation against observation and explains how MODIS vegetation time-series spline functions replaced more generic latitude-longitude functions to represent leaf area index and fractional cover for East Africa. For validation, six-hourly bound ary conditions were obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (Kalnay et al. 1996).</page><page sequence="6">Climate Change and Risk Projection 1043 The RAMS-derived climate simulations spanned two decades: 2000-2009 and 2050-2059, driven with boundary conditions supplied from the Community Climate System Model 3.0 SRES Scenario A1B (cf. Gent 2006); CO2 levels with RAMS were updated in concordance with the boundary conditions. To explore possible changes in tsetse distributions given potential climate change, projected change in mean monthly minimum and maximum temperature between 2001 and 2009 and 2051 and 2059 from RAMS were added to the mean MODIS LST data and used as inputs in the TED model. The change in mean monthly minimum temperature was added to the mean nighttime LST data under the assumption that minimum temperatures most often occur at night. The change in mean monthly maximum temperature was subsequently added to the mean daytime LST data. Given the use of mean LST data, mean NDVIs in conjunction with the mode land use-land cover (LULC) class of each cell were used in lieu of projected NDVI and LULC data. The tsetse percentage probability map and maximum extent map from the TED model using the RAMS-projected changes in mean monthly temperature were then compared to the maps generated using the mean day and night LST, mean NDVI, and mode LULC data from 2001 to 2009, and potential changes in tsetse distributions were then identified. At mesoscales, model assessment and validation were divided into design evaluation, sensitivity, and appli cation error and uncertainty (cf. Santner, Williams, and Notz 2003). The projection components were particularly challenging to evaluate. There are very few studies that address uncertainty attendant to re gional climate model choice due to the complexi ties of multiple comparable simulations (model in tercomparison projects excepted). The few that have indicate that the choice of regional climate model has a large impact on measures of uncertainty, par ticularly in areas where parameterizations are poorly characterized. Because climate uncertainty propagates into forecast models, this additional constraint allowed for defining the limits of the ATcast projections (cf. Moore and Messina 2010). To reduce model-driven uncertainty in the results, the climate projections fo cused on the use of temperature data alone. Moisture, population, and land cover projections could all be used, but the cone of uncertainty would surely exceed the parameter space of even this deterministic model implementation. Results and Discussion The risk of acquiring AT is largely dependent on the intensity and duration of tsetse exposure and the susceptibility of the host population. Figure 4 presents those areas with emerging tsetse populations and those areas that should experience a decline in tsetse, with the important Highlands region identified. Slightly less than 20 percent of Kenya's land is considered high- or medium-potential agricultural land (Alila and Atieno 2006). Because most of Kenya's croplands are concen trated in the higher and historically more reliable rain fall zones of the Highlands, Lake Victoria basin, and a narrow strip along the coast, cropping and mixed farm ing have a distinct spatial distribution across Kenya. In fact, more than 90 percent of Kenya's croplands are found in these areas, and specifically for all areas identified as impacted by changing tsetse distributions in Figure 4, agriculture is the predominant occupation (World Resources Institute et al. 2007). Figure 5 is a bivariate plot map comparing current and future tsetse distributions, focusing on the Highlands region, with human population quantiles derived from the 2008 grid ded global population data (Landscan 2008). Following van de Steeg et al.'s (2010) Highland dis tricts definition, Table 1 identifies districts of greatest tsetse expansion and, of these, all but Koibatek and Elgeyo are found in the Highlands. Further, of the districts where expansion is taking place, only Narok and Koibatek have a population density lower than Kenya's population average. Of the districts where the greatest amount of contraction is taking place, only Machakos is found in the Highlands and only Makueni and Machakos have population densities greater than Kenya's average population density. Of the districts with the greatest net change (Table 2), only Kitui and Kajiado are experiencing a net decrease in tsetse distributions, both rangeland districts with relatively low human population densi ties. Of the districts with the greatest net change, all districts experiencing a net increase in tsetse distribu tions are found in the Highlands (notice that the two non-Highland districts where expansion was taking place—Koibatek and Elgeyo—are no longer listed). Additionally, apart from Narok, all districts with a net increase have a population density greater than Kenya's average population density. Figure 6 presents an alternative view of the distribution of expansion and contraction zones. Although the Highland region is not</page><page sequence="7">1044 Messina et al. Figure 4. The Tsetse Ecological Distri bution (TED) model-projected change in the percentage probability of tsetse occurrence based on projected change in temperature from Regional Atmo spheric Modeling System. An expan sion of tsetse indicates a location where tsetse were not predicted in 2001-2009 but are projected by 2051-2059. A contraction in tsetse indicates a lo cation where tsetse were predicted in 2001-2009 but not projected as present by 2051-2059. A positive value indi cates a location where the probabil ity of tsetse occurrence is projected to increase by the displayed percentage. Conversely, a negative value indicates a location where the probability of tsetse occurrence is projected to decrease by the displayed percentage. The region referred to as the Kenyan Highlands is outlined in blue. (Color figure available online.) all at similarly high elevations, it represents a general physiographic description of the region. That the link between elevation change and expansion or contrac tion is strong is not surprising given that the dynamic variable was temperature. It does provide additional support for the concern that tsetse will expand into the economically critical higher elevation areas of Kenya. Susceptible human populations are those who live in proximity or travel into ecosystems suitable for tsetse habitation in which there are inadequate control or population preventative measures. It is likely that males and females within different age groups have different occupation and mobility patterns, resulting in similar levels of risk within ecosystems but differential levels of risk across ecosystems. Further, infected populations with lower incomes are at higher risk of debilitating se quelae because of limited access to preventative and curative resources. Finally, varying levels of popula tion density are associated with varying levels of human risk depending on the threshold level of the ecosystem and tsetse prevention and control efforts. Specifically, emerging epidemic or endemic ecosystems require dif ferent thresholds of tsetse vectors and infective reser voirs to support the transmission cycle. For example, in densely populated Highland areas trypanosomiasis transmission might have high potential in emerging ecosystems (i.e., new tsetse niches) if there is a growing human-infection reservoir base in addition to animal reservoirs and prevention and control measures have not been initiated. At the contextual level, political commitment, the transportation network, and the socioeconomic infra structure in which populations reside and travel can directly or indirectly impact the transmission cycle</page><page sequence="8">Climate Change and Risk Projection 1045 Population Quantiles Tsetse S Figure 5.

Area poverty might increase the risk of tsetse exposure and human trypanosomiasis via the poor quality of the local environment (e.g., presence of wild animal reservoirs and overgrowth of brush). Finally, it is likely that future contextual factors (i.e., structural factors and area poverty) will indirectly impact tsetse exposure and trypanosomiasis infection by exacerbating population-level risk factors in certain ecosystems. These demographic and social variables and their direct and indirect interactive effects on the risk of human trypanosomiasis in fection should drive specific risk-reduction control strategies. Tsetse flies are a particularly attractive vector insect for disease ecology space-time modeling. First, tsetse fly populations of the various known species tend to have low vagility (i.e., low dispersal rate) and tend to cluster in favorable habitats. Second, tsetse population density varies substantially seasonally, and there is only modest evidence for density-dependent control of pop ulation density, suggesting that density-independent factors operate primarily in regulating population size (Rogers and Randolph 1985). Thus, both locally and regionally, populations can be expected to vary spatially in density as a function of the availability and dynamics of adequate habitat for adults and for their live-born progeny. This largely explains the mystery surrounding emergent and disappearing populations, but scalar climate impacts alter the ability of tsetse to move into historically occupied spaces and also open historically inhospitable spaces. This is not endogenously predictable and is completely missed by the traditionally relied upon presence-only sampling. Climate change will alter many infectious disease systems and impact heretofore unsuspecting and vul nerable populations (cf. Sutherst 2004). We certainly agree with Rogers and Randolph's (2002) assertion that proposals for the eradication of tsetse typically ignore historical, political, and ecological precedents. Tsetse flies exist in a complex space-time dynamic directly driven by ecological and anthropomorphic conditions. Reflecting this, ATcast produces spatio temporal map products identifying the realized niche for tsetse and populations at risk given the complex multiscale interactions of climate, people, and the environment. Tsetse and AT are very likely to (re)emerge under climate change scenarios as significant disease challenges. Planning, mapping, and monitoring efforts benefit from collaborations among interested organi zations, although much remains to be done (Simarro et al. 2010). The probable expansion of tsetse into the Kenyan Highlands directly threatens the core of the agricultural dairy industry and places what is currently a large population of people at new exposure risk. By effectively preparing the health care system, veterinary services, and control measures, these potentially serious impacts might be mitigated.
