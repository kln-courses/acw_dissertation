WOLFSON Biblical Myth and Rabbinic Mythmaking (Oxford University Press, 2003) is a capacious examination of the mythic potential in the ^??* Jewish hermeneutical imagination expressed in biblical, rabbinic, and r **% kabbalistic sources. As we have come to expect from Michael Fishbane, p*aq this monograph is replete with exacting analyses of primary texts that Q?d serve the aim of grounding larger theoretical assumptions that pertain to Jewish textual practices in particular and to the mythopoeic sensibility in the history of religions more generally. The author himself instructs the reader early on that the purpose of the book is "an attempt to retrieve, study, and even reconstruct the phenomenon of monotheistic myth over the course of two millennia ? focusing on its first literary articulations in the Hebrew Bible and continuing through the increasingly intensified process whereby mythmaking occurs in classical rabbinic Midrash and the medieval Kabbalistic book of Zohar, by means of hermeneutical re formulations of scriptural myths and language" (p. 13). Prima facie, the locution "monotheistic myth" may strike the ear as an oxymoron, but Fishbane is one of several contemporary scholars who have challenged the older antiquated depiction of ancient Israelite mono theism as a rejection of pagan mythology. On the contrary, from Fish bane's perspective, not only is it inaccurate to view monotheism in this light but Scripture should be seen as the wellspring of "the cultural forms and the concrete expresdions of a vital mythic imagination, found in classical texts of the Jewish monotheistic tradition." These myths, accordingly, "do not occur either as private or inchoate musings, but as processed and particular statements made at specific times and passed on as part of a vast cultural enterprise. We may say that the myths do not occur in the The Jewish Quarterly Review (Spring 2006) Copyright ? 2006 Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.

The "motor that makes the many myths of Scripture manifest" is identified as exegesis, for the interpretive gesture "extends and transforms older motifs ... In ever artful ways, new myths and narratives are produced; and in ever creative ways, the resources of tradition (Scripture, Midrash, and Kabbalah) are integrated and projected into transcendental domains" (p. 305). It follows, therefore, that the "exegetical bond between Scripture and myth," which comes to light in the homiletical dicta of the rabbis and the theosophic ruminations of the kabbalists, "implies that this canonical source conceals a deeper dimension about the acts and nature of God, and thus the language of the readable text is but the surface of another narrative about divine deeds or divine feelings hidden from immediate view. To know how to read rightly is thus to know that the historical character of Scripture is but the verbal outcropping of another narrative ? not an account of Israel but of God, and not of the events of the earth but of the hidden acts of the Lord in heaven" (pp. 308-09). In Fishbane s reconstruction of the exegetical trajectory, there is a cru cial difference between the rabbis and kabbalists: the former considered Scripture to be the "measure of myth," whereas the latter, and especially the Castilian circle responsible for the zoharic anthology, maintained that "Scripture is itself the myth of God." Alternatively expressed, the aggadic explication of Scripture on the part of the rabbis was inspired by the hope of finding "exegetical proof or warrant for God's sorrows and sym pathies, and for His decision to share in the fate of Israel." To be sure, the kabbalists shared this goal as well, but they went beyond it as their "ceaseless scriptural exegesis and interpretation of its mysteries" consti tuted "a mode of mythical living, for there is no separation between living the truth of Scripture and living within the truth of God . . . Scripture suffuses all; for it is the real myth of God, insofar as this is ever or at all sayable in human speech or accessible to the human imagination. God's truth is refracted in fragments of myth bound by the syntax of Scripture" (p. 309). It is not always clear that this distinction can be upheld, and I think it fair to say that Fishbane himself is not unaware of the point of convergence. Indeed, one of the most important ramifications of Fish bane's study is the narrowing of the alleged gap between midrashic and kabbalistic perspectives. The boldness of the zoharic exegesis notwith standing, the close readings of midrashic texts offered by Fishbane dem onstrate the inherent mythopoeic properties of rabbinic theology, and thus his corrective to previous scholars who have insisted that mytho poeic images employed by the rabbis are merely metaphors or figurative</page><page sequence="3">MYTHOPOEIC IMAGINATION-WOLFSON 235 tropes sapped of their mythic vitality. Medieval kabbalists revised the earlier material, but there is good reason to accept their claim that they were explicating secrets embedded in the aggadic dicta. A crucial aspect of Fishbane s study, indeed a notional pillar upon which the whole edifice rests, although it is not thematized as such, in volves the intricate relation between time and hermeneutics. In the re mainder of this brief note, I wish to delve more deeply into this matter. Underlying the emphasis on exegesis as the power that energizes and revives older myths is a presumption regarding the dialectic interplay of innovation and preservation, hermeneutical conditions that are correlated with the temporal categories of change and repetition. In one passage, Fishbane addresses the issue by noting that the "real cultural issue at hand" is determining whether or not the mythopoeic activity exemplified in medieval Kabbalah? "a protean exegetical energy that turns biblical verses in every conceivable direction in order to reveal their esoteric truth" ?is "a new birth or a rebirth of older processes?; and, Is this the return or invasion of alien pagan elements, or the recrudescence and re formulation of inner-Jewish images and topics?" (p. 10). The response to these hypothetical questions is unequivocal on Fishbane s part: the preponderance of myth in kabbalistic doctrine is not a new birth but a rebirth, the mythmaking is not the grafting of some foreign element onto the body of Judaism but a recrudescence, a revivification of creative ele ments that lay dormant beneath the surface. To appreciate the full force of these claims, we must again raise the issue of time in relation to the hermeneutical presuppositions of Fish bane's argument. I do not think it disrespectful to say that the book would have been enhanced philosophically had the author offered the reader a sustained discussion of this topic, but even in the absence of such a dis cussion there is surely enough material to allow the conscientious reader to elicit the conception of temporality that undergirds Fishbane s herme neutical orientation. The persistence of mythic structures through time is assumed, but in such a way that they are renewed by exegetical concerns that ensue from the exigencies of particular moments in history. Thus, in one passage, Fishbane writes of the "anthropomorphic and anthropo pathic imagery of Scripture" that "was variously developed and intensi fied by its midrashic and kabbalistic inheritors, who also received the mythic figures of antiquity and extended them through bold and innova tive exegetical strategies" (p. 11). Eschewing an approach to myth that would ignore specific historical contexts and cultural locations in favor of atemporal archetypical paradigms, Fishbane insists that the "more imme diate cultural task that is required" is "to reconsider certain biblical and</page><page sequence="4">236 JQR 96.2 (2006) rabbinic evidence in the light of related comparative phenomenon" (p. 12). Methodologically, Fishbane wishes to have his proverbial cake and eat it too; that is, he insists on considering historical context when evaluating a mythic confabulation, but he is not enslaved to a historicist understand ing of historical context. The identification of "external correlations must then be supplemented by more nuanced evaluations of their respective meanings and functions in context. Such a procedure will allow us to consider the nature and vitality of the imagery involved ? aided by an analysis of the modes of discourse involved and the cultural strategies that the specific topics encode. Certainly no definition of myth will give a fixed Archimedian point, agreeable to all; but it may provide something of a wobbling pivot around which we may analyse certain cultural data from a comparative and even more universal perspective" (pp. 12?13). The implicit issue of time and hermeneutics is addressed somewhat more directly in the following statement: In what follows, I shall adopt a typological approach that will isolate several paradigmatic configurations overall, and use these types to ex plore the varied character and construction of monotheistic myth in the sources, as well as its patterns of thematic continuity and transfor mation. Such a methodological strategy will permit a synchronie analy sis of central topics in each separate period (with due attention to the diversity of motifs and structures), and facilitate their diachronic corre lation and comparison in different corpora, (p. 13) Utilizing the terminology of Ferdinand de Saussure, who distinguished between synchronie linguistics, the study of language at a particular point in time, and diachronic linguistics, the study of the history or evolution of language, Fishbane seeks to adopt a methodology that is attentive equally to the permanence of mythic structures through time and to the evolution they undergo relative to changed historical circumstances. Illus trating what he calls the principle of parsimony from the specific theme of divine combat, Fishbane concludes that "a mythic topic in Hebrew Scrip ture . . . can undergo a recontextualization in the exegesis of rabbinic Midrash but still remain the same mythic topic overall, if the terms re main the same and if there is no wholesale theological or literary transfor mation. This granted, it must nevertheless be stressed that every new occurrence of a mythic topic (in its new context) produces a new myth overall, insofar as the concerns and purposes of the latter varies. The principle of parsimony does not therefore mean that a myth or mytholo</page><page sequence="5">MYTHOPOEIC IMAGINATION-WOLFSON 237 gem in its various renditions is always one and the same but only that similar images should be assumed to be the same and have the same semi otic value unless there are good textual reasons to conclude differently" (p. 18). Another consequence of Fishbane s study as it relates to the question of time and hermeneutics is his challenge to the assumption that myth making is "a feature of degeneration and decreased spontaneity." Rather than viewing literary evolution within a specific cultural matrix in linear terms as a progression from a primitive mode of mythic imagination to more abstract forms of rational thinking, Fishbane understands myth as a "key factor in the revitalization of earlier sources and a sign of ongoing cultural creativity" (p. 20). By insisting that the process of exegetical mythopoesis is predicated on a complex synthesis of enduring mythologie symbols and ever-changing modalities of mythmaking, Fishbane s think ing is a subtle and sophisticated reinscription of the very process that he sets out to describe in scholarly terms. He is to be commended, for pro viding a path that avoids the extremes of empiricist reductionism and archetypal essentialism. Discerning structures that cannot be reduced to time-bound eventualities does not preclude the necessity to examine the historical contexts that inform the exegetical process of revisioning and reformulating older mythologoumena. Quite to the contrary, the sophisti cated hermeneutical model constructed by Fishbane enables the reader to stand at the intersection of the two seas, the sea of permanence and the sea of fluctuation. The process of mythmaking in the Jewish religious sensibility so deftly described by Fishbane ensues from that very point of junction where the temporal is eternalized and the eternal temporalized. The point is well illustrated by Fishbane in his comments on the theme of divine pathos and the longing for reunion in a passage from the Zohar (3.42a-b). The cry of the Shekhinah above and her yearning for cohabita tion with the holy One parallel the lament of the people of Israel below and their hope for redemption from exile. Reflecting on the symbolic parallelism between events in the divine and human realms, Fishbane draws the following conclusion: Where myth ends and history begins is just as mysterious as where history ends and the myth begins. For the teachers who speak here, neither the one nor the other is truly the truth. In fact the two are really one, under the two aspects of time and eternity. It remains for the reader to ponder and to wonder at this mystery, so boldly ex pressed in these teachings of the book of Zs)har. (p. 297)</page><page sequence="6">238 JQR 96.2 (2006) Myth and history are correlated respectively with eternity and time. The mythical suffering of the divine corresponds to the historical suffering of the Jewish people. The mystery brought to light in the dark luminosity of zoharic Kabbalah consists of the fact that there is one truth with two manifestations, the eternal and the temporal. The mythic and historical are not to be set in binary opposition, but they are rather two sides of one coin. As is well known to philosophers, intellectual historians, and scholars of religion, there has been a tendency to correlate linear time with the historical and cyclical time with the mythical, and a further association of the former with ancient Israel and Judaism and the latter with either Near Eastern or Hellenistic models of religious philosophy. But the con ceptions of time that one may elicit from the tripartite of biblical, rabbinic, and kabbalistic sources is a convergence of history and myth that renders the more standard perspective dubious. Fishbane s insight regarding the nexus of myth and history lends support to the suspicion that the modal ities of linear and circular time are not easily separated in the case of Judaism. Recurrent patterns transpire within the narrative framework of linear succession ? the timelessness of lived time extending in the attenu ated circle of return ?yielding a temporality that is at once interminably ephemeral and ephemerally interminable. An appreciation of the mytho poeic dimension of the Jewish exegetical imagination meticulously docu mented in Biblical Myth and Rabbinic Mythmaking requires that one fathom the mystery of the eternality of time from within the cloak of the tempo rality of eternity.</page></plain_text>
