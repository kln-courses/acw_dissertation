<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kant's Conception of God, a critical exposition of its metaphysical development, together with a translation of the Nova Dilucidatio. By F E. ENGLAND, M.A., Ph.D. With a Foreword by PROF. G. DAWES HICKs. Pp. 256. George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1929. lOs. 6d. net. IT is related of a certain Oxford professor that, when asked whether he liked sermons, he answered, " Yes, provided they are long enough". We might say the same about books on Kant. So many of them, at least of those published in this country, are too short. Hence they fail to do justice to the magnitude of their theme and to make the impression they deserve. You cannot, for instance, in consider- ing Kant's Theory of Knowledge, confine your outlook, as Prof. Prichard did in his able work, to the first half of the first Critique. Kant's philosophy must be taken as a whole, and this simply cannot be done, as Ward, for example, tried to do it, in a small compass. Dr. England, taking as his theme the Kantian conception of God, lays himself open to a similar charge. He covers the whole, or nearly the whole, ground, but with too swift a stride. The relevant matter in the three Critiques cannot be adequately handled in a hundred pages. We are not suggesting that Dr. England's survey is superficial, or that his criticisms lack definiteness or penetrative insight. He knows Kant and the vast mass of Kantian literature thoroughly, as is evidenced not merely by Prof. Dawes Hicks' testi- mony in the Foreword, but by the all-too-infrequent critical dis- cussions in the notes. His references to Kant's precursors -and contemporaries (e.g. to the influence of Crusius on the Nova Diluci- datio), and his illustrations from living thinkers (e.g. Bergson, Broad, Russell and, especially, Whitehead) are always relevant and interest- ing. We are told in the Foreword that Dr. England has been long engaged in gathering materials for the interpretation of Kant's philosophy. What he has given us here is so good that we wish he had dispensed the fruits of his researches more liberally in the present volume.</page><page sequence="2">F. E. ENGLAND, Kant's Conception of God. 231 The book is divided into three sections. After a clear and admirable survey in the first chapter of the situation as it came to Kant from his rationalist predecessors, we are carried forward in Chapters II. and III. from the Nova Ditucidatio of 1755 to the eve of the publica- tion of the first Critique. The second section (chs. IV.-VI.), entitled "The Transcendental Logic and its Metaphysical Implications," deals with that Critique, particularly with the problems arising for Kant in connexion with the functions of Understanding and Reason and with their bearing on the Ideal of Pure Reason., Up to this point, it would be unfair, to cavil at Dr. England's brevity. Readers may reasonably be supposed to be acquainted with the data and the main points of controversy, especially as they have Prof. Kemp Smith (with whom the author is in substantial agreement) as their pilot. In the third section, Dr. England comes to close grips with the Idea of God. It is considered in relation (a) to the contingency of the phenomenal world and the presupposition of an'Unconditioned noumenal ground (ch. VII.-compare also ch. X).,. (b) to the recog- nition, in the Critique of Judgement, of purposiveness in Nature (ch. VIII.), (e) to the facts of moral experience and the metaphysical construction to which they give rise (ch. IX.). The closing chapter (X.), on " The Idea of God as Ultimate Ground " gathers together Kant's later utterances on the subject, with an all-too-brief notice of the Opus Postumum, and gives the author's own views as to their validity and value. There is added, in the Appendix, an excellent translation of the Nova Dilucidatio, hitherto inaccessible in English, which will prove of service to students unversed in Latin. It is in this third section that we feel the need for a fuller pre- sentation of the argument. Too little attention has been paid by English philosophers to the interpretation of the Grundlegung and the two later Critiques. Yet they are of cardinal importance for an understanding of Kant. His chief concern in the destruction of the old transcendent metaphysic was to establish a new immanent meta- physic in its stead, Hence the importance of the problem of the Ideas of Reason, and particularly the Idea of God. On the vexed question of their statns, the author follows Prof. Kemp Sm'ith in holding that the trend of Kant's thought led away from the view that limits their scope to " heuristic principles, regulative of the empirical exercise of reason," and towards the view that, like the categories, they possess objective validity as conditions of possible experience. So he writes of the Idea of the Unconditidned that " it is only in and through this Idea of Reason that we can ever come to know the phenomenal character of the world of sense- experience " (p. 135); and he goes on to show how, on this basis, the Cosmological argument may be rehabilitated in a form com- patible with Critical principles. "If it be granted that all our con- cepts, whether categories or Ideas, are justified by their indispens- ability for the task, of organising experience, then the concept to which the cosmological argument points must be admitted as a</page><page sequence="3">232' CRITICAL NOTICES: ,oncept of something real., This does not for a moment mean that a first cause exists. . . . The very notion of a first cause violates any and every conception of causality. The question of the origin of -the chain of empirical events appears to be for ever outside the scope *of reason. What the argument does mean is that the only escape -from the antinomies involved in our sense-experience lies in the notion of a whole which is itself free from the limitations attaching -to the parts " (pp. 139, 140). The truth is that Kant's criticism -of -this argument in the Dialectic is one of the weakest things in his philosophy. He treats it, as he found it in contemporary Ration- -alism, as implying the priority of the possible to the actual, as concluding to the hypostatisation of that empty and artificial con- ,cept, the Inbegriff aller maglichen Pradicaten; whereas its- force has lain, throughout its long history, in the basic principle that possibility presupposes actuality, and in the inference to a res vera, a necessary Being who is pure Act. It is strange that Kant, whose thought was a life-long travail to rid metaphysics of the incubus of the " merely possible," should have stigmatised the cosmological argument "as a trick consisting merely in trying to avoid proof of the existence of a necessary being a priori by mere concepts ". As Dr. England ;says, " Kant could speak of 'mere concepts' only so,long as he was viewing concepts as predicates of things in the manner of Leibniz'? i(p. 195), and only so long as he " tended, in his subjective mode of thinking, to regard the Ideas as concepts of abstractly possible things as distinguished from objectively real concepts " (p. 196). That a similar reconstruction of the teleological argument is pointed to in the, Critique of Judgement is the theme of the succeeding chapter (VIII.), on " the purposiveness displayed in nature " which strikes us, despite its brevity, as the ablest in the book. Here again -the destructive criticism of the Dialectic left much to be desired. Like that of Hume in the Dialogues, it was directed in the main against a merely external teleology. In the third Critique, Kant -is confronted with the inner teleology of living organisms. Can the principle of Zweckmdssigkeit, characteristic of the faculty of Judge- -ment alike in its aesthetic and in its teleological exercise (see the author's excellent note on p. 145). be regarded merely as "a regulative principle for the reflective Judgement " ? Or does the doctrine of Nature as a system of mechanical laws break down in face of bio- -logical facts ? Dr. England relentlessly exposes the shifts to which Kant was driven in his effort to maintain his ground, whether it be the distinction between the determinant and the reflective judge- ment, or the appeal to a noumenal intuitive understanding to solve a problem which arises strictly within the province of dis- cursive thought. " Nothing but sheer dexterity avails to save Kant from the pressure which the problem of the living organism has brought to bear upon his whole Weltanschauung " (p. 148). He sees, -as Hegel saw, the need for the recognition of new categories. " It .seems impossible to maintain at once that the objects of experience</page><page sequence="4">F. E. ENGLAND, Kantt's Conception of God. 233 are rendered possible only through the application to sense-data of the categories, and that organisms are given in experience: . . No analogon of life is required for the interpretation of the organism; the organism is alive, and as such differs toto coelo from anything to be found in inanimate nature " (what, by the way, would Dr. White- head, towhom the author more than once refers, say to this?). "And if certain facts of experience cannot be interpreted as due to mechanical laws, but require the concept of purpose or end, the teleological principle has equal claims with. the categories to be regarded -as a transcendental principle " (pp. 154-155). Dr. England goes further, and in the latter half of the chapter argues that the concept of inner purposiveness implies that of a designing Intelligence. We cannot here follow out his correlation of Kant's doctrines with later speculative theories of creative evolution, or his analysis of Kant's moral argument to Theism in the ninth chapter. Gathering together the results of his three-fold inquiry, he concludes that ",if our interpretation of the universe of fact be left incomplete except as we form some conception of a supreme being as the ground of its unity, its Gesetzlichkeit, and its natural and moral Zweckmdssiqkeit, such a principle would appear to have equal claim with the categories to be considered transcendentally, i.e. metaphysically, necessary" (p. 209). That Kant never arrived at this position, despite " his ever- widening view of the nature of real existence," was due, Dr. England holds, partly to his rigid bifurcation of the realm of being into knowable phenomena and unknowable noumena, partly to his manner of conceiving God on the lines of contemporary theology. Hence he never squarely faced the question of the sort of concept we must form of God " if we are to do full justice to the facts of experience ". We are not so sure about this. The Opus Postumum shows Kant at the close of his life speculating very freely on this question, can- vassing with apparent approval views of God's nature suggested now by Spinoza, now by Zoroastrianism, now by Fichte, views very alien to those of traditional German theology. Then there is the Religion within the bounds of mere Reason, which Dr. England omits from his survey, with (e.g.) its interpretation of the doctrine of the Trinity in moral terms. Moreover, Kant's concept of God was surely shaped in the light of his own early religious experience. Dr. England is silent on this topic, and would doubtless plead in justification that his essay is limited to the metaphysical development of Kant's concept. But can this metaphysical development be understood apart from Kant's personal religious history ? It was not merely that the destruction of the rationalist claims in the Dialectic forced Kant back on Practical Reason as a basis for Theism. He had early learnt the perils of religious Schwadrmeres, and the need of checking resolutely his own partiality for mystical speculation, for which the Dreams of a Spirit-Seer furnishes such interesting evidence. He had learnt too to associate religion intimately with practical morality. 16</page><page sequence="5">234 CRITICAL NOTICES: Hence his transfiguration of morality into religion; hence the numinous chtiracter in which, as Prof. Webb has pointed out, the moral law presented itself, not merely to his mind, but to his heart. Dr. England recognises (p. 178) that " Kant had made the transition from the moral law to the lawgiver very hesitatingly," and rightly censures " his way of stating the nature of the inference " in the Critique of Practical Reason as " extremely unsatisfactory " (p. 179). Was not this because the moral argument, if formulated more directly, would lead naturally to a doctrine of God's immanence ? Whereas Kant, under the influence of his own moral experience, clung tena- ciously to God's transcendence. It is only in the Opus Postumum that we find him swinging free of old associations, and writing of God as " no substance discoverable outside of me, but merely a moral relation within me ". Dr. England's closing chapter is anattempt to answertwo questions, (a) as to the nature of the conception of ultimate reality indicated by the facts of contingency, purposiveness, and morality, (b) as to the objective validity of the Idea of an ultimate moral ground. We have already referred to his views on the second of these questions. On the first, he expatiates with much freedom, setting against Kant's Inbegriff and intuitive understanding and Hegel's timeless Absolute his own conception of God's temporal personality. God is the ultimate individual, identified with " the existent, temporal, dynamic, developing, self-creative universe ". " God cannot be at once the sole ultimate individual and merely the supreme subject or supreme intelligence, for there would in that case be no room for a not-self. But it is possible to conceive God as the sole, ultimate individual whose self is confronted by a not-self, which, though not external to him, is as real as the content presented to my processes of appre- hension when those processes are directed to the events which go to the make-up of my own total personality " (pp. 192-193). This is interesting as a statement of Dr. England's view; but, in face of the many objections it provokes, it needs much fuller argument than he can find room for at the close of a book on Kant. He is bound to show, for instance, how the not-self confronting God can be other than external to him, how, in short, the view escapes the pitfalls of dualism. And, when all allowance is made for anthropomorphic analogies, can such a God be conceived as perfect or as an object of' religious worship ? Is he, in other words, entitled to the name of God ? Dr. England's concept of God invites comparison with Dr. Whitehead's, to which reference, at once sympathetic and critical, is made in the note on p. 167. He accepts Whitehead's theory that " God is the principle of concretion, the principle of determina- tion or ordering activity, the antecedent ground conditioning every creative aci," but rejects his postulate of indeterminate creativity. We suggest that a consideration of the distinction between God's " priniordial " and his " consequent " nature, as recently developed in Process and Reality, would facilitate a more plausible recQnstruc- tion of the position which is cursorily indicated in these pages.</page><page sequence="6">F.

The style is clear, though one sentence (at the opening of the second paragraph on p. 140) clamours to be rewritten. We have noted a few un- important misprints: p. 31 for promamare read promanare, p. 56 for possible read possibile, p. 58 for metaphysicae read metaphysice, p. 58 note I for cogitable read cogitabile, p. 59 for hace read kaec, p. 74 for irrepraesentible read irrepraesentibile, p. 178 note 2 for Religio read Religion.
