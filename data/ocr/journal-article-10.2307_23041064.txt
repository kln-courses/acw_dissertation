<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust by Michael Clarke Alcmaeon. I journeyed hither a Boeotian road. Chorus. Sailing on horseback, or with feet for oars? Alcmaeon. Plying with speed my partnership of legs. Chorus. Beneath a shining or a rainy Zeus? Alcmaeon. Mud's sister, not himself, adorns my shoes.1 When I came across Housman's Fragment of a Greek Tragedy I took it as a joke, and a whimsical and mannered one at that, but since then it has become disquieting to realise that nearly every daft expression in it has an exact equivalent somewhere in a genuine Greek play. For anyone who is trying to understand ancient views of the world by studying literature, Housman's piece is a serious scholarly document: a warning that the Greek language — or at least the species of it that is wielded by the tragedians — is liable to communicate in ways that cannot be translated into sensible English. Once that point is conceded, it is only a short step to accepting that on the word-by-word level it is impossible to understand the language at all. At the risk of looking like a pedant I think that this problem strikes at the heart of our claim to know how to read Greek; and as scholarship based on schoolmasterly certainties becomes a thing of the past, I believe it will be possible to use this aporia to good effect, learn ing important lessons from difficulties of comprehension that our more learned predecessors no longer faced once they had ceased to be schoolchildren. I want to explore a single case of the problem as a means of discussing a crucial difference between the ways that Greek and English poets think. In the snippet of Housman that I have quoted, the joke rests on the fact that Greek is liable to extend the application of fam iliar words in ways that find no equivalent in English, and that hence sound strange when reproduced in a word-by-word trans lation. In different examples the phenomenon might be called metaphor, metonymy, shift, or what you will: whatever the label, the point in each case is that a word representing a certain idea seems to be 'pushed' so as to apply it to a referent where it does not normally belong — sailing is pushed onto riding, walking to rowing, and so on — and when the corresponding English words 7</page><page sequence="2">Michael Clarke are pushed in the same way they produce something silly or even meaningless. That said, I turn from Housman to find Aeschylus really describing dust as the sister of mud. Clytemnaestra2 sees that a messenger is coming from the fleet of Agamemnon: ...^lapTupet 8e (iol Kaait; TTr|\oO £woupo&lt;; Sitjna kovk; Ta8e, coq out' avauSoq outc aoi Scuwy &lt;j&gt;\6ya i)Ar|&lt;; opeiai; ar)p.avel kcittvwi uupo^, a\\' rj to xoupeiv |j.dXXov e«:|3d£ei Aeywv... (Ag. 494-8) Mud's sister and neighbour, thirsty dust, assures me of this, that this messenger, not voiceless, not kindling the flame of mountain timber, will not make signs by smoke of fire, but will by his words express more clearly the joyful news . . .3 Somehow the dust shows that he will make a verbal announce ment, and that it will be serious: presumably the point is either that dust settled on his clothes is evidence of unceremonious haste, or that he is moving swiftly with a number of attendants (or indeed the entire army) and so kicking a cloud of dust up into the air.4 There is no knowing how to choose between those two, because we cannot tell how far away he is supposed to be from the stage at this point. Either way, the dust implies to Cly temnaestra that the messenger will come with a verbal message rather than simply continuing the fire-signals that have already announced Agamemnon's return. 1 do not know what she means when she says dust is mud's sister, and I do not believe that anyone else has produced a fully satisfactory answer.5 Paley sug gested, ingeniously enough, that the mud is 'sister and neigh bour' to the dust because the mud is on his shoes and the dust is on his cloak, but this does not explain why they should be brother and sister.6 Verrall hypothesised that the territory of Argos consisted of two parts, one called the Dry (as Homeric TroXt)8i.4&gt;LOv"ApYO&lt;;, and 5u|sla kovk; here) and the other called the Wet, so that the cloud of dust would be seen rising from the dry land of the plain between Mycenae and the sea;7 but there is no authority or parallel for his claim that the areas were so defined, or that such things could be described as brother and sister. A further nineteenth-century editor8 suggested that mud was the neighbour, £i)voupo&lt;;, of dust because dry dust begins to be seen where damp mud ends: I suppose such a phenomenon is not 8</page><page sequence="3">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust impossible, but in a country where rainfall usually takes the form of a sudden downpour on dry earth one would hardly see mud and dust alongside each other, and in any case this suggestion fails again to explain the family relationship. Page describes Aes chylus' words as 'perilously close to the ludicrous',9 which is not a helpful remark, and goes on to suggest that 'perhaps dust is called "sister and neighbour of mud" for the reason that mud . . . may turn to dust when dry; it is thus "related to" and "not far removed from" dust';10 but this seems unreasonable, since the point that the one can give rise to the other would seem to sug gest parentage rather than a relationship between brother and sister; and I do not think he explains the Greek words by digging up two homely English idioms which sound roughly similar to them, since this kind of verbal equivalence does not necessarily give any clue to the real meaning of the Greek. He and the other editors actively pervert their text by translating 'sister and neigh bour', as if these were alternative images with the real meaning of the relationship lying between the two; although such doub lets are indeed possible in tragic Greek,11 what we have here is not a doublet but a noun qualified by an adjective. £woupo&lt;; (= Guvopoq) is used regularly of lands that physically border on each other, and occasionally of things whose nature is closely simi lar:12 perhaps 'closejoined twin sister' or even 'Siamese twin' would render Aeschylus' words adequately. Since £woupo&lt;; adds extra force to its noun, Aeschylus is not passing from one vague metaphor to another but instead demanding somehow that we take koctii; au pied de la lettre. What next? The first temptation is to say that the words Kaaic; TrrjXoO £woupo&lt;; are unimportant to understanding the speech, since they do no more than qualify the unambiguous kovk;. The basic train of thought would be equally clear or equally obscure if the dust were named without further elaboration, so 'mud's sister' could be dismissed as baroque or whimsical decoration with little or no meaning of its own. It seems to me very unsatis factory that among modern readers any adjective or adjectival expression used attributively is in danger of suffering a fate equivalent to that traditionally laid up for Homeric epithets, where one hears phrases like 'mere epithet', 'verbal fossil' or 'archaic formula' even from the least tired of commentators. Although Housman himself was content to dismiss Kaaiq TTr|XoO £woupo£ as 'mere ornament' in a discussion of our passage,13 it seems to me quite fallacious to assume that these or any other 9</page><page sequence="4">Michael Clarke words are semantically vague or 'woolly'14 simply because they are not a building-block in the essential syntax of the sentence. Shifting ground slightly, one could guess that the poet is misus ing words deliberately to convey a sense of Clytemnaestra's sinis ter duplicity; the phenomenon might be akin to the disturbingly bad taste of her welcoming speech, where the strangely inappro priate images convey an impression of deceit. When she says (866-873) that if the rumours of Agamemnon's death and wounds were true he would have needed to be like three-bodied Geryon, or more full of holes than a net, the ghastly images add to the foreboding that she is saying more or less than she means: the more weird her words, the greater the feeling that the cittXoOi; Xoyoc, of sincerity is missing. Something similar can be claimed for the language of the Chorus in the Parodos of the Seven against Thebes, where their panic is perhaps conveyed by con fused phrases like ktuttov SeSopra (Septem 103), 'I see a crashing noise'. Although there may well be some truth in this sort of interpretation, it would be extremely dangerous to apply it a priori for no better reason than that a certain word has proved difficult to understand. Indeed ktuttov SeSopra itself is an instruc tive case in point, since with an effort one can dig up enough equivalent expressions to support an argument that transference from one sense to another (synaesthesia) is a recognised and eas ily-understood species of Greek word-use.15 Further, within the Agamemnon the sinister aspect of Clytemnaestra's disposition tends to be discernible in the bizarre inappropriateness of her rhetoric rather than in dark obscurity on the level of individual words: so that all in all it would be arrogant and wilful to use this theme as proof that Aeschylus is being deliberately perverse in putting our passage together. Obvious as this last point seems, it needs further emphasis. As a general principle, to assume that Aeschylus' hard words are hard because he writes odd Greek is only slightly less defeatist than the ancients' story that his plays are peppered with bizarre expressions because he composed them when he was drunk.16 The underlying question is that of the relationship between poetic language and poetic communication: between poet and audience there is an unspoken agreement as to the ways in which the poet can push or twist language to create meanings that would not be conveyed in plain prose. Even within our own tra dition the competent reader of poetry finds that different types of pushing were practised in different ages. To take a simple 10</page><page sequence="5">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust example, one would explore the possible implications of 'green ness' according to quite different standards when Shakespeare's Cleopatra talks of 'my salad days, when I was green in judgment',17 and when Marvell in a reflective mood talks of 'a green thought in a green shade',18 and when Dylan Thomas remembers 'fire green as grass'19 from his childhood idyll. Each poet has creatively re-applied the idea of greenness to a new referent, but he has done so in a way typical of his own style and generation alone among the three. Shakespeare plays boldly (perhaps whimsically) on traditional English colour symbolism, where green stands for innocence, and produces a subtle interac tion; Marvell transfers greenness from the visible world to the mental; Dylan Thomas tosses words around to produce an effect of overflowing sensual awareness. To interpret all such images we must be supple enough to read each work according to a kind of academic reconstruction of the compact that existed between the author and his contemporaries. Between the English passages the question is one of historical development within a single tradition; the equivalent question for our Greek material is less of date than of genre.20 Restricting ourselves to tragic iambics, then, what sort of expectations did real-life Athenians bring to bear on their interpretation of poetic words? A useful source is the mockery of Aeschylus' language in Aris tophanes' Frogs, where amid the comedy it is possible to discern something of the way the ancients expected to listen to their poets. The impression is that our poet's contemporaries might find his words lofty and strange and difficult, but they did not expect them to be meaningless. Certainly his poetry might include esoteric words that the listener had never heard before, dyiAjjTa toi&lt;; 0£O)(xewi^ (Frogs 926) and consequently hard to understand, £un.f3aXeIv 01) paiSia (929); but that is not the same as saying that the purpose of his esoteric wordsmithing was to create an effect of loftiness and glamour without simultaneously communicating through the straightforward meanings that were tied to the words themselves. In fact, from the mockery by Dion ysus and Euripides it seems that the hardest thing in Aeschylus' language, the feature that made his language 'bristling-browed and crested' (Frogs 925), was his use of new and extravagant com pounds: and it is instructive that the compounds which Aristo phanes invents (or quotes) in parody are quite clear and mean ingful if one cuts them up and makes sense of their constituent elements. The problem with Aeschylus is that it is difficult to 11</page><page sequence="6">Michael Clarke extract verbal meaning, and not that the meaning is lacking in the first place. I emphasise this because our own (essentially lyrical) tradition encourages us to expect that a poet's meaning will lie in sound and rhythm and vague allusion, as much as in anything that can come out in word-by-word construal, and in this sense (as Robert Frost famously put it) 'poetry is what defies translation'. This is very much a Romantic idea, although for many of us Shakespeare is its most obvious exemplar: and there is every reason to think the Greek practice is different. The Frogs gives a simple reminder of this in Aeschylus' angry retort to his detractors: . . . aXA' w KaKo8ai|iov avdyKri [leyaXtov yvtofiuv Kai Siavoiwv laa Kai to pi^aTa tiktciv (Frogs 1058-9) He says that what gives rise to high words must naturally be high ideas: the words are imagined as the carriers of meanings in a simple one-to-one correspondence. Michael Silk in a celebrated article21 has argued that Greek poetic tradition contains 'iconyms', words whose force lies in their sound or atmosphere or traditional associations (e.g. untranslatable passages in Homer) rather than in their denot ative meanings. But the only positive evidence for the existence of any iconym will be the scholar's inability to fit the attestations into a comprehensible pattern;22 and given the comparatively tiny size of the surviving corpus of early Greek verse, it is hardly surprising that what we find in isolation might belong in a larger unity of meaning that is now hidden from us. It would obviously be bad practice to invoke Silk's theory to dismiss a puzzling pass age from literal exegesis. Nonetheless this is what I, and probably most people, tend to do on coming across puzzling Greek expressions. To read, by and large, is to translate the Greek men tally into a safely emasculated English version and dispose of the eccentricities by calling them 'poetic'. But what happens if we refuse to do this? The longer I linger over 'mud's sister', the more doubt it casts on my ability to extract meaning from Greek words. Since the immediate context is unhelpful, inspiration must be sought further afield. The first line of defence is to dig up Aeschylean parallels as close in subject-matter as possible. Fraenkel23 offers 12</page><page sequence="7">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust us one from the description of the seven champions in the Sep tem: Hippomedon has an image on his shield of the monster Typhon, belching forth 'thick smoke, the sister of fire': TikJxBv' ievTa ttupttvoov Sia oro|ia Xiyviiv neXaivav, aioXriv TTupot; Kacnv (Septem 493-4). Here, of course, the problem is essentially the same, though to the modern ear the image perhaps seems less bizarre.24 Fraenkel also adduces three intriguing snippets of Hipponax, including aaPoXot) KaaLyy^TT) (103.9 West) and fJoXpiTou Kaaiyi^Triv (144 West), where, unfortunately, we have no clue as to the identity of the 'sister of soot' and the 'sister of dung'. Commentators on those passages can say little25 beyond the possibility that Hip ponax' language is colloquial and even 'primitive', or that he is making fun of traditional cliches.26 Of course it is possible (just) that Aeschylus' image is meant to make its effect by directly recalling Hipponax, in which case its meaning might be better understood in terms of the slightly baroque or archaic patterns of image-making that seem to be more common in iambus than in tragedy; but even if that is true, the dramatist's words must still carry meaning within the conventions of his genre. Up to a point, the whole problem of 'mud's sister' can be seen as an accidental by-product of reading a dead language in a library. It could be argued that the oddity of the image of sister hood in English has nothing to do with the force of Kaaiq in Greek, and that we simply poisoned and killed the Greek growth by transplanting it from its native soil to the walled garden of our own language. It seems to me that there is a deep question at stake here, and that its nub is our conception of what we are doing as we read the Greek text word by word. For want of a better term I identified Kaan; as something like a metaphor, but that label emerged from a twisted process of thought. It is worth looking back over the action of reading, as it were in slow motion. I saw the word Kctaiq in its context, glossed it with an English word which I believed to be roughly synonymous, namely 'sister', and asked how that word might fit the context. In effect I shifted the Greek word onto an English field of mean ing, upon which I became puzzled, because the usual sense of 'sister' is not applicable to the sort of relationship that dust enjoys with mud. I decided that I needed to explore the field further in search of a corner where an English speaker or (more 13</page><page sequence="8">Michael Clarke likely) an English poet might push the word 'sister' so as to apply it to that relationship. But a serious problem lurks behind the claim that Kctaic; is a metaphor. The starting-point of my reading was the fact that I was brought up to follow a lexicon which gives 'brother, sister' as the English equivalent of KaaiQ. How was that judgment reached? Partly, no doubt, on the strength of tradition: Liddell or Scott or their successors had learnt to translate the word in this way when they learnt Greek at school, and in their subsequent reading they came across no instance which could not be dealt with either by supplying this gloss or by identifying a metaphorical usage. This impression has been strengthened over the years by the reasonable surmise that no significant change is made to the meaning by the second element in Kaaiyyr]TOc/ KaaiyWjTr], which is commonly used of human bro thers and sisters.27 The stem has no obvious cognates in Greek or other languages, so that its meaning cannot be explained by comparison with other words: we are deprived of the crutch that is offered us by aSeXc^o^/ d8e\cj)r|, for example, which was connec ted by the ancients with 8eX&lt;f&gt;u&lt;;, 'womb'. Essentially, then, people's only trustworthy guide to the word's meaning has been the fact that in the majority of instances the context suggests that kchtk; identifies someone as having at least one of the same par ents as someone else, in just the same way as English 'brother, sister'. This fact allows the scholar to structure his beliefs about Kaaiq in a way which is convenient but is thoroughly grounded in the thought-structures which he uses as a speaker of English. His understanding centres on the unchallenged belief that the central, straightforward or 'literal' meaning of Kdcriq can be apprehended by mapping it onto that of 'brother, sister', taking all other usages as deviations from this norm, whether metaphor ical or 'metonymic' or otherwise extended in novel directions. The model can be imagined as two wheels, one labelled 'brother, sister' and the other labelled Kaaiq, joined by an axle which is the genetic relationship between two children sharing at least one parent. This procedure draws in two implicit problems. One is the assumption that the point of contact between 'brother, sister' and Kaon; is the centre of the range of meaning of Kaaiq. This is an arbitrary judgment based on the belief that what can be easily grasped and pinned down in our own language must be more simple or more significant from a Greek point of view as well. The other problem is the assumption that the transfer 14</page><page sequence="9">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust of sense from this central meaning to other, subsidiary or trans ferred, meanings can be expected to be similar in both langu ages. In the case which we have been discussing, this approach was applied by thinking in English about possible metaphorical uses of family relationships and establishing one or more English phrases to fit the bill — Page's 'related to ' and 'not far removed from' was the perfect example. But the range of ideas that links the different applications of either word must be an idiosyncratic product not only of the language itself but also of the culture which gives birth to it and enables its users to find meaning in each others' utterances. In other words, when a Greek hears the words Kctaiq ttt|\ou £woupoq he recalls associations of ideas that might have had nothing in common with what occurs to an Englishman or an Irishman from 'mud's close-joined sister'. This means that the common-sense approach to interpreting Aesch ylus' phrase is worse than useless, because the implicit act of translation meant that the interpretive problem was transferred out of the cultural context in which was held its one hope of ever being answered. I hope that this is enough to establish what must, I think, be the basis for investigating any instance of what people call meta phor — any instance, to state it more accurately, in which a Greek word seems to be used in a sense that does not look straightfor ward. The task is not linguistic but cultural, because it is only by entering into a Greek world-view that we can guess what range of referents might come to be covered by any given word. But we live in a world dominated by dictionaries,2® and in reading a dead language we tend to structure our mental lexicon accord ingly. Consider the implications of this. The Liddell-and-Scott approach to Greek is to frame a word's definition through a process of division and tabulation. First, the word is divided into a series of numbered sections, each of them representing a chunk of meaning discrete in itself. Within each section various English approximations are listed, and the reader is supposed to split the difference between them. These numbered sections are arranged in a deliberate order, perhaps linked together by a word like 'hence' or 'thus', but always giving precedence to the section that is supported by most Homeric attestations29 or that corresponds to the largest number of attestations overall. Within each of these sections there may be further sub-sections, joined to the main chunk of meaning by a link of some more or less conceptual kind — fig., trans., metaph., etc. It is implied that the 15</page><page sequence="10">Michael Clarke overall meaning of the word is not a single thing but a group of things. The numbered sections can be imagined as islands of varying sizes, separated from each other either by deep water and linked to smaller offshore rocks by the bridges represented by fig., trans., and their kin. Everyone knows this structure is a matter of convenience, but the dictionary claims authority, and it will hardly be a good tool if the organisational structure is shown to be false. Perhaps we will accept the overall shape of an LSJ definition — perhaps, that is, we will agree that the list of English equivalents in a given entry answers approximately to what the Greek word was used to signify — but do we need to accept their conception that the Greek word can be understood by dividing it up into different islands? The question is a very real one, because this is not the only way to organise a dictionary. Leaving aside the functioning dictionaries of modern European languages, where the conti guity between the cultural worlds of (say) an Italian and an Englishman greatly lessens the problem,30 we can learn a lot from looking at a dictionary of a language whose cultural hor izons are almost as remote from modern English as are those of the ancient Greeks. Take Father Dineen's great Irish diction ary.31 Dineen's basic method is to gloss each Irish word with as many English translations as will enable the reader to grasp its full breadth of meaning,32 and then to cite a number of Irish phrases where the word appears, translating each of these with equally idiomatic English expressions which need not involve any one of the words which were used as direct glosses in the first part of the entry.33 The virtues of Dineen's system, it seems to me, are twofold: first, that the reader is prevented from mapping the Irish word onto any one English word, and secondly that little or no attempt is made to cut the meaning up into discrete segments with contrived links between them. The sequence of more or less interrelated glosses suggests an area of meaning — a conceptual field, as it were — so that the reader must make a deliberate and active effort before he can claim to have under stood the word. The effort becomes all the more difficult in the second part of the definition, because the reader sees how dis tinct and un-English is the life of the word in practice. For any one trying to learn Irish in the manner of a dead language, by looking up one word after another in a text, using Dineen is difficult and slow, because he allows us no short cuts: the enquirer is denied the luxury of explaining the Irish word to 16</page><page sequence="11">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust himself by latching onto one or another English word, and so he is encouraged to think his way into the conceptual structures of the Irish language. To take an example comparable to Kaaiq, Dineen's method is well illustrated by the entry for mathair. Mathair, g. -thar, -thara (Con.), pi maithre, m&amp;ithreacha, f., a mother, a dam, a producer; matter, beginning, origin, source, cause; m. mhor, a grandmother, sean-mh., id.; m. cheile, a mother-in-law; m. bhaistidhe, a god-mother; m. ail, mother of a brood, a prolific mother, a queen-bee; m. bhuidh, pia mater, a queen bee, the soft membrane of the brain, al. the remnant of corrupt matter of a wound (al. m. thuig, prob. for m. thruig); m. chruaidh, the dura mater the hard membrane of the brain; m. na mballach, a fish (six inches long with external rows of teeth); m. an ciirne, the blackthorn; m. an duilisc, gigantina mammilosa; m. an uilc, the source of mischief, the cause of an abscess; m. ghuir, the slough or matter in an abscess or boil, the source of suppu ration, m. ionghair, id.; m. cogtha choscartha eagcuinn, the cause of destructive warfare is imbecility (or fools, Dav.); m. uisce, a water-source; m. do mhainistreacha na h-Eorpa, the parent (house) of the abbeys of Europe (F.F.) After the apparent chaos of the first glance, such an entry encourages the reader to recognise two surprising things: first, that the word may extend over a field whose unity he has never apprehended before, and second (even more important) that the field may border on others which might not seem adjacent to one who thinks in English. Where Liddell and Scott tame and shackle the Greek language, cutting up its unities into bite-sized chunks that can then be fitted snugly into a wholly English frame work, Dineen forces the reader to enter a wholly new and unfam iliar world. The upshot is that the Irish language is presented as a radical organisation of things and ideas which cannot be understood except through its own vocabulary, while Greek is reduced to something more like a code or cipher. I cannot actually prove that Dineen is 'better' than LSJ except through the principle of Occam's razor. The model for defining kcicti^ which looks like an archipelago is much more complex than the model that looks like a field; and above all, both the seas separating the subsidiary islands from the main one, and the causeways which occasionally link them, can only be justified as a solution to the modern interpreter's problems, not to the observable facts of Greek use of the word. If I can sketch the meaning of Kaatq as a single field, where a natural and easy stroll 17 B</page><page sequence="12">Michael Clarke could somehow bring me from human siblings at one end to a Greek view of mud and dust at the other, then I will have pro duced a model which is at once simpler or more elegant and also more characteristically Greek. That is the crucial point. Because I am treating the overall meaning of the word as a conceptual field, rather than simply as a lexical archipelago, I will try to take a stroll through Greek ideas, as freely as is possible with our limited knowledge, rather than by leaning on the crutch of Anglo-Saxon mental realities. To recapitulate: because Kaaiq is glossed as 'sister', and because that English word does not apply in its normal sense to the relationship between mud and dust, the lexicographical habit encourages us to pronounce it a metaphor. We look at the word; we land on the island which we have defined as 'kc(cti&lt;; = sister'; and we pass over the bridge called 'metaph.' (or possibly fig.) to a subsidiary island where koctk; can refer, in some more-or-less vague and whimsical way, to the relationship between mud and dust. I am not sure what our editors think is happening when that bridge is crossed, so I will shun it. Returning to my own model, what happens when I stroll from one end of the field of Kaai&lt;; to the other? This question is one about the relationship between language and thought: specifically, whether that move ment is an inventive pushing of language or the exploration of a traditional bundle of ideas which not only associates human sisterhood with the relation between mud and dust but also allows the definition of human sisterhood to be affected by that intimate association. In other words, does the metaphor reflect an association of ideas that is embedded in the Greek world view, or does it show the sort of creative thing that Greeks can do with their language? Is Aeschylus staying within the traditional boundaries of the field of Kaai&lt;;, or is he knocking down part of the wall and extending the field temporarily in a new direction? There can be no direct answer to those questions. However, to make the stroll freely we must set aside the modern categories of word-use that cannot have played any part in a Greek view of sisterhood and the world. The most important is the artificial distinction between literal usages on the one hand and 'pushed', 'transferred' metaphorical usages on the other.34 Once we con sider our word's meaning as a single field there can no longer be any grounds for setting apart a group of unusual usages as if they involved a metaphorical 'substitution',35 that is as if the 18</page><page sequence="13">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust word in question were there transferred from its natural mean ing to something else. What if the so-called metaphorical usage could be seen as a hint of a shadowy conceptual unity that exists independently of any one word?36 For example, although I do not subscribe explicitly to the belief that 'an argument is a building', I body forth that concept when I construct an argument, build it up stage by stage, and then feel the whole edifice crashing around my ears when my opponent removes the cornerstone and shows that my beliefs were without foundation.37 In such a skein of language and ideas the so-called metaphors do not simply represent my understanding of what arguments are: rather they help to shape them, and the fact that Plato (for example) is much more likely to speak of an argument as if it were a hunt (see e.g. Republic 432b7-e2), with the speakers pursuing a nimble quarry, probably indicates an important gulf between the ways that the two cultures conceptualise a learned conversation aimed at establishing a truth. The further question then arises, whether this linguistic phenomenon has any bearing on how we are to understand the ancient conception of hunting in its 'normal' sense: in the terms of my present discussion, the question would be whether there is a deep conceptual unity hid den in the semantic range of the verb 8iu&gt;ku), used indiscrimi nately for pursuing a hare and pursuing the right conclusion to a debate (see e.g. Republic 454b6). Because argument exists only in language and cannot be conceptualised without words, it fol lows that the Greek conception of what argument is must be shaped and moulded by the language in which it is clothed. Hunting, on the other hand, exists in the visible world and can be understood without depending on words at all, so that per haps the Greek view of hunting is not influenced in the corre sponding way by their conception of argument as pursuit.38 But when we try to talk about the relationship between mud and dust we are in an area of expression where language is clothing the intangible in shapes that arise solely in the human mind, so that the power of words and ideas to mould each other is far more strong in both directions. To understand Kaaiq ttt|\oO £0voupoq in this spirit, the dichot omy that must be broken down is not simply that between 'lit eral' and figurative language in general but more precisely that between language and myth, between the words in which Greeks describe the world and the so-called religious beliefs in which 19</page><page sequence="14">Michael Clarke they make sense of it. As Ernest Cassirer has written in a succinct attack on this dichotomy, ... If one were to ask which of the two types of metaphor [sc. religious and linguistic] begets the other — whether the metaphor ical expressions in speech are produced by the mythic point of view, or whether, on the contrary, this point of view could arise and develop only on the basis of language — this question is really specious. For ... we are not dealing here with a temporal relation of 'before' and 'after', but with the logical relation between the forms of language and of myth, respectively: with the way the one conditions and determines the other. The determination, however, can only be conceived as reciprocal. Language and myth stand in an original and indissoluble correlation with each other, from which they both emerge but gradually as independent elements.39 If the core of Cassirer's argument is transferred from his own concern with historical developments to the synchronic under standing of a single Greek poet — that is, if we explore Aeschylus' own world-view by moving freely from words to myths and back again — then it will be easy to explain 'mud's sister' in a way that could not have been approached on the level of words alone. The key can be found not by beginning not with mud and dust themselves but with the myths associated with Gaia, the earth. If we refuse to assign the divinity of Gaia to the sphere of religion, and if we further refuse to put the label of 'metaphor' onto the figurative language in which our poets describe the earth, what conceptual unity will we identify behind the various levels of image-making on which the word yaia operates? The first clue comes indirectly, from one of the 'primitive' passages of Hipponax which our editors cited as parallels for 'mud's sister'. It looks comparatively innocent, describing the fig as the 'sister of the vine': auicfjv (leXaivav, d[iTTeXou Kaaiyvrj-rriv (fr.52 Degani = Athenaeus 3.78bc) The line survives as a quo tation. Athenaeus tells us a story from an otherwise unknown epic poet: 'Pherenicus the epic poet . . . says that the fig (auKrj) is named after Fig (ZuKrj) the daughter of Woody ( O^uXoq): for he says that Woody had intercourse with his sister, a hamadryad, the daughter of Mountainous ('Opeioq), and amongst others he begot Hazel, Date, Cherry, Mulberry, Marsh-Plant, Plane-tree, Vine, and Fig; and these were called hamadryad nymphs, and from them many 20</page><page sequence="15">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust trees are named: which is why Hipponax says 'Black fig, sister of the vine'. It is easy to see that either Athenaeus or the mysterious Phere nicus has modified or euhemerised a story in which the children of the family were not nymphs with plants' names but simply the plants themselves, just as Hipponax says. Their identity as plants holds within it their identity as divine persons: the implicit prin ciple is the same as that expounded explicitly by Tiresias in Euri pides' Bacchae, where he lays down the mythopoeic principle that Dionysus is the vine itself (278-85). The same principle will explain mud and dust fully and explicitly, once we accept the conceptual reality that the earth on which men stand is fully and literally the goddess Gaia.40 However familiar the reader may be with the mythological and theological role of Gaia, emphasised most fully by her place among the chthonic powers appealed to throughout the Oresteia&gt;41 it is easy to forget the simple fact that she is precisely identified with the earth below our feet. It is in this way that it makes sense very literally that something should be called 'a child of the earth'. The full scope of Gaia's mother hood is most familiar from within the genealogical logic of Hesi od's Theogony, where her divine and tangible natures are inextri cably fused: from the start she is literally the earth we stand on, TravTiov eSoq da&lt;j&gt;aXe&lt;; aid (Th. 117), and as she produces her family in order she does so in ways that seem by turns to be anthropomorphic and by turns cosmological: the Sky, the Moun tains, the Sea, and Ocean arise from her asexually, because of their visible emergence from the plain of the world, while Cronos, the Giants, the Cyclopes and the Hundred-Handers are born of her sexual union with Ouranos the Sky (oupavwi ewriGetaa, 132). Hesiod's story forbids us to distinguish the seemingly conflicting identities that seem to us to lurk behind Gaia's name. Within a single narrative she is the tangible earth and by the same token she is a goddess. Again and again the tragic poet invites us to glimpse the same idea. The ground beneath us is her body, a(j|i.a (Septem, 947): hence the ancient legend that the pressure of the human race on her back caused her to com plain to Zeus and hence bring about the Trojan War (Cypria, fr.l Bernabe), and hence Sophocles' foreboding that the movement of turning ploughs is a symbol of human audacity in 'wearing down the oldest of the gods': 21</page><page sequence="16">Michael Clarke ...06WV T€ Totv wepTaTay, rdv act)0iTov, aKap.dTav duoTpucTai, iXXopivwv apoTpwv eTo&lt;; eiq cto&lt;;, iTTTreiwi yevei TToXeuojv. (Antigone 337-341) Aeschylus himself reminds us that living things which arise from the earth are children of Gaia by the same token: plants are earth's children, tckva (e.g. Persae 619), and the earth bears all living things and rears them, tLktctcxi and Tpe&lt;}&gt;ei (Persae 619, Choephoroe 585-6). Since the (to us) inanimate earth is fully alive, it makes good and uncomplicated sense that her children should include not only plants and animals but also the physical sub stances that arise from her, like Hesiod's Mountains. A fascinat ing passage in the Supplices turns from an account of the flooding Nile to describe rivers in general as TToXirreKvoi, begetters of children: ...TT0Ta|i0u&lt;; 8' ol 8ia x^paq 0eXep.6v TTwjxa xeouaiu ttoXOtckvoi XiTTapoiq xeiVaai yaia&lt;; To8e p-eiXiCTCTOvTeq ov&amp;ac, (1026-8) If we avoid the temptation to take TToXvTeicvoi as a vague ellipse — 'giving increased births of (human) children', or the like — then Aeschylus says precisely that rivers mingle with earth and thus produce offspring in the form of oozing mud.42 If we accept the pervasiveness of Gaia's generative role, it makes eminently good sense that mud should be her male offspring and dust female. Because they arise from the earth they are her children, and that is no more and no less than what parenthood always means; but the children have different personalities, and the gen ders of the nouns Kaaiq and tti-|X6&lt;; reinforce the character of the mythical family relationships: just as all rivers have masculine names because they embody the seminal force of rushing water, while springs and wells tend to be feminine, so the wet and cling ing mud is masculine and the more feeble or passive dust is feminine. Such, then, is the literal sense in which dust is mud's sister. Its oddity and obscurity in English lie solely in the fact that we in our scientific age tend not to describe things as people, except in more or less quaint and poetic language, while for the Greeks there is no a priori distinction between the family relationships 22</page><page sequence="17">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust of gods and the physical or generative relationships that subsist between parts of the world's furniture. To conclude, I want to offer a suggestion as to why Housman was able to make a better joke out of our passage than of others like it. It is curious that plenty of other images based on family relationships can be found in Pindar and the tragedians, but none of them sound quite so strange to a modern ear. The difference is that the things in question tend either to be fully alive in themselves or to be rather abstract and intangible. At a glance, for example, Pindar offers many images of a celestial or biological kind that translate well into poetic English: day is the 'child of the sun' (01.2.32), rain is the 'child of the cloud' (Ol.l 1.3), and wine is the child of the vine (Nem. 9,52); while in the fully abstract category Sophocles describes folly as the sister of disgracefulness, ^icopia ...a8eXcj&gt;r| Tfj&lt;; Trovripiai; (fr. 663.2), while Pindar talks of Ewopia ...Ka&lt;JiyWjTa *re Alkci (01.13.6), and names Ortygia as the sister of Delphi (Nemean 1.4). Images like these seem to stand up fairly well in English, because there is no 'literal' picture in our minds on which the image of sisterhood must be superimposed: it would be virtually impossible to describe these relationships suc cinctly without drawing in an extraneous picture or idea of some kind, and family relationships fit the bill. Common sense boosts our self-confidence. It makes sense that folly and wretchedness are kindred because they both 'spring from the same source' in misfortune or bad character; Good Government and Justice have the same source in Zeus or wise mortal rulers; and Ortygia and Delphi are apparently linked by the cults of Artemis that belonged in the two places. But 'mud's sister' is as concrete and mundane as anything in everyday experience: so that its strange ness to our ears was an accidental by-product of the fact that the Greek world-view can use the logic of family relationships between gods not only to give form to the living or the invisible but also to explain and conceptualise the shapes and processes of the visible but motionless world around us. From the perspec tive of the fifth-century BC there may well be nothing strange or eccentric about applying that logic to something as lowly as the dirt of the roads. Notes 1. A. E. Housman, A fragment of a Greek tragedy. 2. The basic question over these lines is not much changed if we join some editors in attributing them to the Chorus, rather than Clytemnaestra as in the transmitted text (for 23</page><page sequence="18">Michael Clarke summary of arguments on both sides see O.

The explanation that has most in common with what I will advance is that of Schiitz (cited by Fraenkel), 'una enim eademque ex terra, madore lutum, calore pulvis gignitur', but even this falls far short of making the passage sound sensible. 6.

'Woolly' as a metaphor for verbal vagueness has an interesting history: first used by the author of On the Sublime, who describes Aeschyus as making woolly images, aicaTep ydcrToui; icai oiovei noKotiSeiq Taq emnai; Kai d|iaXaKToui; (Ilepi 'Yi(ioik; 15.5). 15. Hutchinson ad loc. has a strange note suggesting that because seeing is superior to hearing in the pecking-order of the senses, the Chorus describe an especially vivid act of hearing as if it were one of seeing. In support of the purely negative explanation, that the Chorus are confused, note Eteocles' speech after the Parodos, when he complains that women like them habitually panic (181-202). Against all this, the defender of Aesch ylus can cite a few other examples of expressions where sound and sight seem to merge. Most are from Sophocles: SepKOjim &lt;jxmv (Trachiniae 693); &lt;)&gt;d|iai&gt; Xeuoaeiv (Philoctetes 485); 8€8opKa cfida^a (Electra 1458); also O.C. 1463, Ajax 870, Electra 1410; even one from the Iliad, Xeuatju...iu&gt;iiv (16.127). These examples are quoted by W. B. Stanford in an eccentric but very helpful discussion, Greek Metaphor (Oxford, 1936), p. 51. 16. Athenaeus, Deipnos 1,21D; also Plutarch, Quaest. Conviv. 7.10, p. 715E. 17. Antony and Cleopatra I.v.73-4. 18. The Garden. 19. Fern Hill. 20. This point is vital, and I wish I could say more about it. The intensely strong sense of genre in Greek must mean that two works written at the same date might follow quite different systems of image-making even on the level of individual words. For example, if the Hesiodic Shield of Heracles was written within a few generations of Aeschylus and Pindar, which is quite possible, the difference in standards of word-use between the epic and other genres may be such that the metaphors and metonymies of the Shield would be best understood in terms of Homeric and Hesiodic language alone, with the language of epic communicating entirely through its own norms. There is no equivalent for this in English: Tennyson or Shakespeare or Louis MacNeice will push language in equally 'poetic' ways whether he is telling stories or engaged in lyrical reflection. 21. M. Silk, 'LSJ and the problem of poetic archaism: from meanings to iconyms', CQ 33 (1983) 303-330. Silk's conception of iconyms as part of Greek poets' verbal sophis tication makes for an interesting comparison with the Victorian feeling that the aesthetic effect of a line might lie in the very difficulty of extracting meaning from it: consider Verrall on Agamemnon 408-413: 'I am almost unwilling to vex these lines, exquisitely beautiful even in the doubt and obscurity which rest upon them, with any further attempt at exact interpretation' (A. W. Verrall, The Agamemnon of Aeschylus [Cambridge, 1899], p. 119). 24</page><page sequence="19">Aeschylus on Mud and Dust 22. Silk (above n. 21) begins with the Homeric example of KV&gt;n(ktx°?&gt; whose two surviv ing attestations (Iliad 5.586, 15.536) are so different — once the name of part of a helmet, once an adjective describing a falling man — that it is imossible to think in English of a single semantic range to explain the two. Silk, following Leumann, holds that this is enough to allow the conclusion that in at least one of the passages KV&gt;npax0(5's not uset^ for the sake of any denotative meaning that it might once have carried. But we know so little about the Homeric world that it may simply be our ignorance that causes the prob lem. If a pile of unillustrated books were all that survived from our own age, a similar problem would arise if the word fishnet happened to survive in modern verse in two different contexts, one concerning fashionable leg-wear and one concerning seafaring. 23. Ad loc. 24. For example, Page at Agamemnon 494f. describes the image in the Seplem as 'much more successful'. 25. O. Masson, Les fragments du poete Hipponax (Paris, 1962), ad loc. Masson adopts Lobel's supplement to the first text, [lapiXri] da(56Xou Kat7iyi&gt;iyrr|: 'embers, sister of soot' sounds plausible and chimes well with 'dust, sister of mud', but it is no more than a guess. The only fruitful discussion of these passages known to me is the note by E. Degani, Sludi su Ipponate (Bari 1984), 163-7. 26. This question is well discussed by Degani (above n. 25), who argues that Hipponax is parodying a cliche of the traditional language of hymns or of epic: he notes esp. such things as &lt;j&gt;u(a, 4&gt;opou KpudeuTO&lt;; eTcupri (Iliad IX.2). 27. 'Du compost KaaiyvriToq est issu un hypocoristique Kaon;, du type des anthro ponymes comme 'AXefi^, etc, en regard des composes AXefiicaKO^, etc' (Chantraine). The judgment that the shorter form is an hypocoristic of the former is no more than a sur mise, and the development might well be in the other direction. (I am indebted to Torsten Meissner on this awkward point.) 28. I know no better essay on this theme that J. Willinsky's vitriolic and fascinating attack on the cultural imperialism of the OED, Empire of Words: the reign of the OED (Princeton 1994). 29. The 1925 preface to LSJ (p. iii) records the persistence of the precept that each definition should begin with Homeric attestations, 'in order to exhibit the history of each word and its uses' (italics mine). 30. Cf. G. Steiner, After Babel (Oxford, 1975): Steiner's concern is with the conceptual leaps involved in moving from one modern European language to another, which is perhaps why I have found his book less useful than I had hoped in facing my own questions about dead and culturally remote languages. 31. P. S. Dineen, Focldir Gaedhilge agus Bearla, 2nd ed. (Dublin, 1927). 32. 'As regards the connotations or meanings of the words, it may be said that few words in any language have a single basic signification. Most words, in addition to the basic meaning, have many shades and developments of meaning; in extreme examples a word may even come to have a meaning which is the exact opposite of its original signifi cation. The aim has been to give the basic meaning precedence and to set down the shades or changes of meaning in due sequence, as far as possible' (Preface, p. ix). There is no equivalent statement of policy in LSJ. 33. 'The aim has been to select for quotation illustrative phrases and passages endowed with something of this deep and vital character of speech, the imaginative glow, the associative colour, that alone can reveal to the student the genius of the language' (ibid., p. viii). 34. The arbitrariness of the distinction between the literal and the metaphorical has been well pointed out by Geoffrey Lloyd (most recently in Demystifying Mentalities (Cambridge, 1990), 14-28), and (for purposes of understanding tragic language) in Ruth Padel's In and Out of the Mind (Cambridge, 1992), esp. pp. 9-11 and ch. 2 passim. Perhaps the most adventurous attempt to take Greek word-use seriously as an index to the Greek world-view is the fascinating work of R. B. Onians, The Origins of European Thought (Cambridge, 1951), which is nowadays taken less seriously than it might be. 25</page><page sequence="20">Michael Clarke 35. There is a useful overview of the history of the 'substitution' view of metaphor in E. Feder Kittay, Metaphor: its linguistic force and cognitive structure (Oxford, 1989), ch. 1. 36. Among linguists the debate on this question has been lengthy and not always prof itable, since their examples tend to come from trivial and decontextualised expressions rather than from serious image-making in real-life literature. There is a very stimulating collection of essays in Metaphor and Thought, ed. A. Ortony (2nd ed., Cambridge 1993). Ortony's own article, 'Metaphor, language and thought', contains a useful overview of the debate. Otherwise, an extremely vigorous argument in favour of the view that 'figurative' language represents and shapes traditional patterns of thought has been advanced in a recent work by R. W. Gibbs, The poetics of mind: figurative thought, language and understand ing (Cambridge, 1994). 37. Such systems of image-making in modern everyday language are entertainingly explored by G. Lakoff and M. Johnson, Metaphors we live by (Chicago, 1980). 38. I refer here to the useful article by Max Black, 'Metaphor', in his Models and Meta phors (Ithaca, NY, 1962), in which he replaces the theory that metaphor works through substitution with the more complex theory that a metaphor involves an interaction between the object of the description and the subject of the metaphorical image. Taking the example 'Man is a wolf, he argues that when the metaphor is apprehended both the 'wolf-system' and the 'man-system' undergo a change in the speaker or listener's mind. Useful as this model is, it falls short of recognising that in the speaker's mind the concep tual link between men and wolves may be still more pervasive and more deeply rooted than any one example of unusual word-use. 39. E. Cassirer, Language and Myth (English ed., New York, 1946), p. 88. For Aeschylus, the same point is made in a succinct and measured way by A. M. Moreau, £schyle: la violence et le chaos (Paris, 1985), 1-17 and 21-103 passim. 40. The only argument against emphasising the divinity of the earth would be that only divinities who receive major cultic attention should be seriously regarded as gods. It will be sufficient answer to this that the place of the gods in the Greek world-view in the broadest sense should be understood in terms of language and story as much as of cult. Possibly one reason for the comparativ e unimportance of Gaia in cult is the tradition that she is silent and immobile: there is comparatively little to be gained from worship ping her, but she remains a pervasive divine presence. The principle is the same as that by which Aeschylus himself can acknowledge that Death is no less a god despite the fact that there is no reason for mortals to offer him gifts: iiovoi; 0ed)v yap 0avaToi; oil 8u&gt;p(oi' epai (fr.161.1 Nauck). 41. See esp. Choephoroe 45, 127, 148, 399, 489; and compare e.g. Supplices 890, Persae 220, 523, 629. 42. Friis Johansen and Whittle ad loc. explain the passage by saying that the rivers are 'promoting . . . the birth of numerous offspring to the people and beasts who drink therefrom', which puts a great strain on the verbal meaning of the Greek. My interpreta tion depends on taking ttoXutckvoi closely with Xirrapoti; xei&gt;(iaai yaiai; rather than more vaguely with 0eXe(ji6v Trw(ia xeouaiu, as Friis Johansen and Whittle do. If the difficult word 8eXe(i6v means something like 'willing', emphasising the personal action of the fruitful river in providing moisture, my interpretation might be strengthened; but this cannot be certain.</page></plain_text>
