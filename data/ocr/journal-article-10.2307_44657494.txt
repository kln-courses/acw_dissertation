Mertz, and Robert P. Hubbard Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp. Mark R. Henderson Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. THE HIGHWAY SAFETY RESEARCH INSTITUTE (HSRI) of the University of Michigan was awarded a contract by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) to pro- duce an advanced state of the art test dummy. The objective of the contract was to develop a 50th percentile anthropo- metric test device having sufficient human fidelity as to yield realistic and repeatable measurements of head accelera- tions, chest accelerations, and chest deflection when sub- jected to simulated crash conditions, using a variety of oc- cupant protection devices. These protective devices were to include conventional interior padding, conventional lap- shoulder belts, conventional steering systems, and inflatable restraints. (1)* The performance of the contract was divided into two phases. In Phase I HSRI developed performance objectives for the dummy. In Phase II two prototype dummies (Fig. 1) *Numbers in parentheses designate Reference at end of paper. - ABSTRACT Two Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) dummies were tested and evaluated. Based on the analysis given, the HSI dummy should not be used for vehicle qualification test- ing. However, many of its components offer viable alterna- tives for future dummy development. The dummy was found to have inadequate biomechanical fidelity in the head, neck, and chest, although its character- istics were very promising and, as a whole, biomechanically superior to the Hybrid II. Its repeatability and reproduci- bility in dynamic component tests were better than the Hybrid II dummy. In particular, the HSRI friction joints were outstanding in repeatability and had a significant ad- vantage in usability in that they do not require resetting be- tween tests. In three-point harness and ACRS systems tests, the values of injury criteria produced by the HSRI dummy were gen- erally lower than those obtained with the Hybrid II, especi- ally the femur loads in the ACRS tests. However, the re- peatability and reproducibility of the HSRI dummy were significantly poorer than the Hybrid II. Also, significant durability problems exist with the skin and lumbar spine of the HSRI dummy. 2311</page><page sequence="2">23 1 2 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL. Fig. 1 - HSRI 50th percentile anthropometric test device were designed, developed, and manufactured by HSRI. They were evaluated by HSRI in accordance with the test program specified in Phase I of their contract for biomechanical fidel- ity and performance in sled simulated crash environments. The dummy is described and the results of their testing are presented in a report presented at the Seventeenth Stapp Car Crash Conference (1). The results presented in their report indicated that the dummy met many of their design and performance objectives. However, only a limited number of biomechanical performance tests were specified and no actual performance requirements were proposed. There was no attempt to correlate the dummy responses with human re- sponses in any of the four restraint system test environments. This was due to the dearth of biomechanical response data which could be used to specify meaningful, objective per- formance requirements. Consequently, the general program objective of developing a 50th percentile anthropometric test device, having sufficient human fidelity to give realistic assess- ments of occupant protection in simulated crash environments for a variety of restraint systems, was not, and indeed could not be, fully realized. PURPOSE - The purpose of this paper is to: 1 . Compare the responses of the HSRI dummy to biome- chanical performance guidelines postulated by other investi- gators (2, 3, 4, 5). 2. Compare the repeatability and reproducibility of various responses of the HSRI dummy with those obtained using the GM Hybrid II dummy for a variety of impact environments. 3. Evaluate the HSRI dummy in terms of durability of construction and ease of use. TEST PROGRAM - The HSRI dummies which were evalu- ated are the two dummies which were designed, fabricated, and tested by HSRI under their MVMA contract. The dum- mies are referred to in this paper as either "Blue" or "Gold", depending on the color of their outer suit. McElhaney (1) refers to these dummies as No. 1 and No. 2 since much of their testing was done without the colored skin suits. Nei- ther HSRI nor the authors were able to identify the Blue or Gold dummy according to McElhaney's designation. These dummies were made available to the MVMA sponsoring companies for independent evaluations of their performance. The Blue and Gold dummies were evaluated with respect to anthropometry; biomechanical impact fidelity; and magni- tude, repeatability, and reproducibility of injury criteria values for three-point harness and air cushion restraint sys- tem (ACRS) environments. To the extent that hardware and time would allow, their repeatability and reproducibility in some of the subsystem component tests specified in Part 572 of MVSS 208 were also evaluated. This evaluation was in- tentionally independent of HSRFs test program and was based on GM hardware and biomechanical performance guidelines specified by other investigators (2, 3, 4, 5). A third head form was purchased from HSRI and was used in the biomechanical evaluation of the head and neck. Both dummies were also evaluated subjectively from a user's point of view. Various durability problems were documented. The Hybrid II dummies used for comparison purposes for many of the test environments were dummies which were used routinely for product evaluation tests by Safety Research and Development Laboratory of General Motors. There is no assurance that any of these dummies would meet all of the response requirements specified in Part 572 of MVSS 208 since the three-point harness tests were conducted prior to this rule making. The Hybrid II dummies used in the ACRS tests generally satisfied Part 572 with a few exceptions. Com- parisons of the Hybrid II responses relative to the biomechan- ical performance guidelines have been reported previously (4, 5) and are not discussed in this paper. REPEATABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY - With regard to repeatability and reproducibility, it should be emphasized that a rather low confidence level is involved for the test re- sults obtained with the HSRI dummy. In most cases only three repetitions of a test were made, and only two dummy samples were available. In some cases one or more tests were invalidated, reducing the sample size to less than three tests. Repeatability and reproducibility evaluations in the bio- mechanical tests were mostly subjective, generally a subjec-</page><page sequence="3">HSRI/GM BIOFIDELITY RECOMMENDATIONS/HYBRID DUMMY 23 1 3 tive comparison of response curves. However, in the MVSS 208 Part 572 component tests and the restraint system tests, where HSRI repeatability and reproducibility were compared with Hybrid II, the evaluation was objective, though not statistically eloquent, as described below. For single valued criteris, that is, HIC, peak acceleration, or maximum deflection, repeatability for a single specimen was described as the minimum variation in the criterion as meas- ured by the coefficient of variation (Cy), the standard devia- tion divided by the mean. If several specimens were avail- able, the best case of a given criterion was used based on the assumption that the best case level of repeatability was achievable if reproducibility problems could be managed. This best case approach tended to favor the Hybrid II dummy when comparisons were made, since there were usually data available for more specimens of Hybrid II than specimens of HSRI dummies. Differences in repeatability were considered significant if the best cases of their Cy's differed by more than five percentage points. For single valued criteria, reproducibility for a dummy type was defined as the ability to reproduce the same mean value of the criterion. The Cy of the means was used as the meas- ure of reproducibility. This was always a relatively low con- fidence statistic for the HSRI dummy, since only two data points were available. The two dummy types were consid- ered significantly different in reproducibility if their Cy's differed by more than five percentage points. Absolute cri- teria for acceptable repeatability and reproducibility were not addressed in this project. BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION The HSRI dummy was evaluated for biofidelity of the head, neck, and chest€ As was mentioned earlier, the bio- fidelity of the Hybrid II has been discussed previously (4, 5) and consequently is not presented in this paper.

NEATHERY, ET AL. an HSRI dummy head purchased by GM. (This was in addi- tion to the Blue and Gold dummies fabricated in the MVMA program.) The measurements were compared with biomechan- ical guidelines (2) currently being used at GM for dummy head development which are based on published anthropo- metry. The geometric measurements and center of gravity location are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The length, width, and circumference of the HSRI head were close to the GM guidelines and within the SAE J963 tolerances for these dimensions. The bizygomatic diameter was measured across the face of the HSRI dummy head at the zygions and was found to be 1 .05 inches less than the GM guidelines, indicating that the facial region is not as wide as the facial region for the 50th percentile adult male. Di- mensions A and B (Fig. 2 and Table 1) indicate that the upper neck attachment for the HSRI head was considerably below and forward of the correct placement for a 50th per- centile male. The HSRI dummy head extended 1.0 inch be- low the base of a 50th percentile male head which could significantly affect the motion of the head on the neck. No standards exist for upper neck pivot placement, but provision for anatomically correct upper neck pivot placement would have been a desirable feature if it had been incorporated into the head. Dimensions C and D (Fig. 2) locate the lowest point on a midsagittal section through the chin. Comparison of measurements of these dimensions on the HSRI head with GM guidelines (Table 1) revealed that the chin structure of the HSRI head was 0.85 inch rearward and 0.26 inch below the anatomically suggested location. In summary, the head dimensions, for which there are requirements in SAE J963, complied with those requirements. However, the facial width and the locations of the upper neck attachment and chin are considerably different from the anatomically sug- gested locations as expressed in the GM guidelines. Inertial Properties - The base plane of the HSRI head was 1.0 inch below the anatomically suggested location (A) of the upper neck pivot so that the inertial properties of the HSRI head could not be measured for compliance with the GM guidelines (3) without removing a portion of the head which was not done. (The head weight given in Ref. (1) in- cludes parts of the neck.) The inertial properties of the HSRI head without any in- strumentation were measured and reported here. The HSRI head weight was 10.3 lbs for the head purchased by GM. The head for the Gold dummy weighed 10.4 lbs. The head weight specified by GM (3) is 10.0 lbs when the head is consistent with the GM head delineration. Considering the removal of material from the base of the HSRI head to comply with the GM delineation and addition of instrumentation and ballast, the HSRI head could probably be made to comply with the 10.0 lbs head weight. However, as the HSRI head existed, it was heavier than its human counterpart, and addition of in- strumentation would have made it even heavier. The location of the center of gravity (e.g.) of the HSRI head without instrumentation is shown in Fig. 2 and given in Table 1 along with GM guidelines. The center of gravity of Ihe HSRI head was 0.3 inch forward and 0.2 inch above the GM location. Addition of instrumentation at the e.g. should not alter this location significantly, but removal of material from the base of the head to comply with the GM delineation would move the e.g. farther away in both coordinate direc- tions from the specified e.g. The GM recommendation for mass moment of inertia about a lateral axis through the center of gravity of a 50th percen- tile male dummy head is 0.19 in-lb-sec2 without any instru- mentation in the head. The moment of inertia of the HSRI head was slightly larger than the guideline. Addition of a triaxial accelerometer package at the e.g. would not increase the moment of inertia significantly. Dynamic Response - The HSRI dummy head was subjected to 14.8-inch frontal drops used by GM for comparison with human cadaver impact response. For this drop height, a range of resultant peak acceleration from 225 g's to 275 g's is the GM guideline (3) for humanlike response. When dropped twice from 14.8 inches on the frontal region, the HSRI head responded as shown in Fig. 3. The results of these two tests are summarized in Table 2. The peak resultant accelerations and the times of occurrence were nearly identi- Fig. 3 - Response of an HSRI dummy head to drop tests from 14.8 inches with frontal impact 1 275,0 Recommended 250.0 - Biomechanical 225 0 Response ì «•- A I «a.- / ' 1 / 1 4^ I ļ I 100.0 - I / ' A «/&gt; I A a&gt; /4 Oč.

The shapes of the traces were different with the second test having a narrower upper portion leading to lower injury assessment numbers (HIC and GSI) as indica- ted in Table 2. Comparison of the response of the HSRI dummy head to a 14.8-inch frontal drop test with the biomechanical guidelines indicated that the peak resultant acceleration of the HSRI head was 10 to 12 g's below the lower limit (225 g) of the suggested range. However, in tests conducted by HSRI, their head impact response data were in general agreement with their published cadaver head impact data (1). NECK - The Gold dummy with the GM purchased head was tested on the WHAM I sled at Wayne State University for biomechanical fidelity of the neck in extension and flexion. There was some difficulty accurately determining the torque about the occipital condyles for this dummy because of the lack of anthropometric and inertial fidelity of the head. Using the head "as is" gave a nearly correct mass, but the neck parting line were moved up to a more appropriate posi- tion geometrically, the head would become too light. Be- cause of this conflict in inertial and geometric properties, the head mass was taken "as is," having a nearly correct mass but incorrect geometry. Adjustments of the head mass of the order involved here would cause minor changes in the torque levels indicated. Extension - Three extension runs were made under the con- ditions specified by Mertz (4). The results are plotted in Fig. 4, and maximum values for torque and angle and the damping ratios are given in Table 3. Fig. 4 indicates that the loading portions of the curves were generally within the rec- ommended loading corridor, although the maximum torques were slightly below the required 40 fit-lbs. The damping ratios were within the 0.4 and 0.6 range required for exten- sion. Thus, except for the slightly low torque levels, the neck completely satisfied the biomechanical criteria for necks in extension. Comparison of the three plots in Fig. 4 indicated very good repeatability of the data. Careful examination of Runs 480 and 481 showed their plots to be very close, and yet the damping ratios varied considerably, 0.55 and 0.46 respectively. This parameter is very sensitive to the phasing of the torque data from accelerometers to the angle data from camera</page><page sequence="6">23 1 6 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL. Fig. 4 - Biomechanics extension characteristics of HSRI neck Fig. 5 - Biomechanical flexion characteristics of HSRI neck coverage. Table 3 gives the maximum torque and maximum angle for these runs and documents the very high repeatabil- ity of these parameters. Flexion - Severe repeatability problems were experienced in the flexion tests of this neck. It took six runs to get three apparently valid tests of the neck. Results from these three tests are plotted in Fig. 5, and the results from one of the irregular tests are shown in Fig. 6. No identifiable fault in the tests was found. In component tests, the head, neck, and chest all appeared to be highly repeatable. Thus, the prob- lem here would seem to have been one of component inter- facing, perhaps belt-chest or chin-chest interaction. The long, protruding and free clavicle would have likely played a role in this. The responses shown in Fig. 5 approached the biomechani- cal requirements. Their primary deficiencies were that the</page><page sequence="7">HSRI/GM BIOFIDELITY RECOMMENDATIONS/HYBRID DUMMY 23 1 7 Fig. 6 - Irregular flexion response of HSRI neck torque levels were late in coming into the loading corridor. The maximum torques were a little lower than the required 120 ft-lbs and, in two of the three cases, the damping ratios exceeded the 0.30 to 0.50 range rquired for flexion. All of these deficiencies appear to be minor and could probably be corrected with tuning of the system. The repeatability of the three selected runs in Fig. 5 appeared to be fairly good except for the damping ratio which was discussed previously. The maximum values of torque and angle are given in Table 3. They had excellent repeatability. This neck has been favorably compared with the Mertz criteria by Melvin (6). Figure 5 indicates that there should be some reservation given to this statement for the flexion re- sponse. The assertion apparently comes from tests on a small sled involving a head and neck only; whereas, the Mertz requirement involves entire dummy system tests (4). Initial Head Angle - The initial head angle on the HSRI dummy was designed to be permanently set for an automo- tive seat back which made an angle of 25° with the vertical. The neck tests were developed on a hard seat which made an angle of 15° with the vertical. Hence, there was a potential of 10° offset in the initial head position. In the extension tests, this would affect only the load, and that in a minor way. In the flexion tests, this would have a similar minor effect on the load; however, it would change the point at which the chin impacted the chest by 10 degrees. Since the HSRI dummy had a flexible thoracic spine and a relatively soft chest, and since the restraint system for these tests con- sisted of tightly drawn crisscross shoulder harnesses and a lap belt, the dummy was forcibly positioned such that he was "looking straight ahead." Therefore, the inertial loading of the head was correct in these tests. The influence of dummy positioning on chin-chest interaction is not clear. This would have to be carefully examined and controlled if the dummy were to be tuned to satisfy the recommended biomechanical requirements. CHEST - Low Speed Test - Low speed chest impact tests were conducted in accordance with Ref. (5). Data were col- lected for two 1 1 mph, 43 lb mass impacts, Fig. 7, of the Blue dummy. A third test was invalidated due to a malfunc- tion of the position transducer. It is necessary but not suf- ficient for biomechanical fidelity (5) that the load-deflection plots of this data lie within the low speed corridor superim- posed in Fig. 7. It can be seen from this figure that the load level was too low until about 1.6 inches deflection, after which it was marginal. The total deflection was satis- factory. The return damping was greater than that seen in currently available dummies; yet it was still inadequate for biomechanical fidelity. High Speed Test - Also shown in Fig. 7 are three tests at 16 mph, 5 1 lb mass for the Blue dummy, and the high speed re- sponse corridor (5). Comparing these with the low speed run indicated that the chest did have velocity sensitivity, since the load was considerably higher during the deflection phase. During the return phase, the high and low speed plots had a common path under 1.6 inches deflection. This appeared to be an elastic return. The load was low throughout the loading phase of the high- er speed test. The chest bottomed at 3.6 inches, producing a spike in the loading. Again, the hysteresis was greater than that of other dummies but still inadequate for biomechani- cal fidelity. The multiplots indicated good agreement be- tween the repeated tests at both 1 1 and 16 mph. Fig. 8 shows the chest response of the Gold dummy under</page><page sequence="8">23 1 8 R. F.

(The low speed tests were conducted with the wrong impactor mass and are not plot- ted.) The response was very similar to the Blue dummy and the same comments apply. Repeatability was quite good again, and comparison of Fig. 8 with Fig. 7 indicated good reproducibility as well. The HSRI biomechanical chest impact data (1) are for fresh cadavers impacted at 12 to 14 mph with a 22 lb mass. Their data indicate they have satisfied this less severe, "re- laxed," nondestructive environment. COMPONENT TESTS The HSRI dummy was tested in several component tests. Some of these are specified by NHTSA for the GM Hybrid II (Part 572). Others are tests GM has used in identifying dummy characteristics. The results from the HSRI dummy are compared with results previously obtained using the Hybrid II. HEAD DROP - Hard Impacts - The DOT-specified head component drop tests (7) was conducted three or more times on each HSRI dummy head in the MVMA program (Blue and Gold). Drop height was 10 inches. Two hours were allowed between drops. The head contact point was determined by orientating the sagittal plane vertically and tilting the coronal plane 32° below the horizontal. The head was instrumented with an Endevco 2267C-750 triaxial acceler orne ter. Test results are tabulated in Table 4. A comparison with Hybrid II is also given in Table 4. The most repeatable HSRI head was the Blue one with a Cy of 0.9 percent compared with the best Hybrid II Cy of 0.3 per- cent to give comparable repeatability based on the arbitrarily selected five percentage points difference rule (see introduc- tion). The Cy of 18 Hybrid II head mean accelerations was 16.4 percent. The corresponding Cy for HSRI was only 1.4 per- cent. Thus, the HSRI heads appeared to be significantly more reproducible than the Hybrid II heads. The data show that the HSRI head was also softer than the Hybrid II. Mechanical Resonance - In the past, mechanical resonance of dummy heads has obscured the acceleration pulses meas- ured during impact events and has led to injury assessments which were difficult to interpret. To preclude this unde- sirable resonance, it has been recommended (3) that the resultant acceleration versus time which occurs during a 35- inch drop test with frontal impact should be unimodal, and oscillations which occur after the main pulse should be less than 5 percent, zero-to-peak, of the main pulse. The re- sponse of the HSRI dummy head to such a test was uni- modal, and the largest oscillation following the main pulse was 4%, zero-to-peak, of the main pulse. A second method of assessing the tendency of a dummy head to resonate is to drop it through a tempered glass panel. In such a test, the head strikes the glass panel and is decelerated in a manner similar to a rigid surface impact un- til the glass panel fractures. Upon glass breakage, the load between the glass and the head decreases to zero much more rapidly than the initial load buildup, and the head is free to respond to this sudden load release. The response of the HSRI dummy head to such a drop test from a height of 48 inches is shown in Fig. 9. Two oscillations of over 120 g's with a mean of 100 g's occurred after glass breakage followed by lower level oscillations. These results showed a pro- nounced tendency of the HSRI dummy head to resonate in response to a suddenly changing load. This tendency was evident in HSRI's Dash/Windshield Impact tests of the dum- my (1). In these tests, severe ringing was obvious in the data and the HIC averaged over 1800.

The results of these tests and pre- vious Hybrid II tests are in Table 5. The Cy for the maxi- mum angle for a sample of 18 Hybrid II necks varied from 4.7 to 1.2 percent. Table 5 shows Cy of 1.4 and 1.5 per- cent for the HSRI Blue and Gold, respectively. The repeat- ability appeared to be comparable between the two dummies considering the best cases. The Cy of the means of the max- imum angle for each neck type indicated the necks were also comparable in reproducibility, since the HSRI Cy was 2.4 percent compared with 4.4 percent for the Hybrid II. 250.0 ^ - Glass Breakage I 200.0 - I 150.0 - il C 1 I m0 " A &lt;2 I i W ji 0 • 0 / ■ - • 0 2 4 6 8 10 Time (ms) Fig. 9 - HSRI dummy head response to a 48-inch drop test through a tempered glass panel with frontal impact Torque-Angle Pendulum Test - Each HSRI neck was also tested on a pendulum similar to the DOT pendulum (7), using a special surrogate head which has inertial properties representative of the 50th percentile adult male. This de- vice has an angle transducer and load cell which allow con- tinuous recording of the head's angular position and the torque at a point analogous to the occipital condyles. Data for the Blue and Gold HSRI dummy necks are shown in Table 6. The results indicated very good repeatability of the maximum torque with Cy ranging from 0.0 percent to 3.8 percent. The angle accompanying this torque had even bet- ter repeatability ranging from 0.0 percent to 1.2 percent. The reproducibility (variation in mean values) of the maxi- mum torque for the dummies was good, Cy being 6.5 per- cent for extension and 6.1 percent for flexion. It was ex- cellent for the angle at maximum torque, being 0.7 percent and 0.9 percent. Data for Hybrid II necks from this test were not available. JOINTS - The left and right shoulder, elbow, and knee joints from the Gold dummy were tested for breakaway torque, resisting torque through 90° of quasi-static mo- tion, and variation of both of these parameters with re- peated testing. Test Description - The proximal end of each joint was fixed in a vise and a load was applied perpendicular to the distal portion of the limb through a spring scale. The load was slowly increased until motion began (breakaway torque). Quasi-static motion was maintained through 90° in a hori- zontal plane, keeping the load perpendicular to the limb. The load indicated on the spring scale was visually monitored throughout the test and recorded at the completion of the test.

Test Results - Data from these tests are presented in Fig. 10. All repeated testing gave results within the previously indi- cated precision. Except for the left elbow, the difference in breakaway torque and quasistatic torque was near the pre- cision of the measurements. The breakaway torques for the left knee, left shoulder, and right knee were observed to be "about the same" as the quasistatic torques, though no data were recorded. Variation in torque with position, as the joints were exercised through 90° , were within the precision of the measurements. The right elbow was exercised through 100 cycles with no measurable change in resisting torque. No changes in joint stiffness were evident from a one g type test after 16 sled tests with the dummy. Further, five weeks later, after extensive testing of both dummies by Chrysler and GM, all joints maintained a 1 g - 2 g specification. Hybrid II Joints - The Alderson knee and elbow designs have been similarly tested by GM. These joints are used in the Hybrid II dummies. The Knee joint which was tested had a variation of 28 percent in frictional torque as it was exercised through 90° of motion. When tested through 100 cycles, the variation in frictional torque was about 15 per- cent. Three elbow joints exhibited roughly the same characteris- tics as the knee joint. However, a fourth elbow joint had very poor characteristics. The variation in frictional torque through 90° of motion exceeded 100 percent (high/low). Repetitions of the test continually loosened the joint until it was virtually free after about 40 cycles. This joint type has at least a reproducibility problem and possibly a repeatabil- ity problem as well. The Alderson knee and elbow do not have a common design. The knee has relatively soft springs in the adjustment mechan- ism while the elbow does not. All of the tested HSRI joints have a common design with relatively soft springs providing the normal force for the friction plates. These joints are in- dependent of joint bolt torque, although the friction setting can be discretely changed. They do not require readjusting between sled tests of the dummy. The Alderson joints are</page><page sequence="13">HSRI/GM BIOFIDELITY RECOMMENDATIONS/HYBRID DUMMY 2323 CD 03 Ö O CU m 0 Pí 4-i 03 0 rtí 0 I- I t-H S it 'S d HH PÍ CO S3 1 t&gt; 0 i-H 1 1+ H • oor^ • • 'Or&gt;. • • CM •••••• vO + O» rH i*» + 1+ H oor^ 'Or&gt;.

The HSRI joints appeared to be superior in repeatability and reproducibility to the Alderson (Hybrid II) joint. However, an Alderson joint was signifi- cantly improved by minor alterations and careful attention to details. CHEST - The DOT chest impact tests for Hybrid II are slight modifications of the GM tests for biomechanical fidel- ity. Since considerable data have been collected for both versions of chest impact and since they are roughly similar, data from both versions are combined in Table 7 for repeat- ability and reproducibility comparison purposes. Data are also included for 1 1 mph impacts of the HSRI Gold dummy when a mass of 5 1 lbs was inadvertently used instead of the 43 lb mass which is prescribed for the low speed impact tests. The means, standard deviations and coefficients of varia- tion, are given in the table for the Blue and Gold HSRI dummies and the best and worst cases of Hybrid II tests. When data are combined for a particular dummy design, the standard deviation and Cy refer to these statistics for the means. The Hybrid II data are from 48 tests of 1 6 dummies, as indicated in the table. Again, comparing best cases for repeatability and requiring a difference of five points in percentage Cy for significance, the following conclusions were reached. In the low speed test, the HSRI was comparable to the Hybrid II in the re- peatability of the maximum load (0.0 and 0.3 percent) and the maximum deflection (0.6 and 0.0). They were also com- parable in the high speed tests with coefficients of 1.9 and 0.1 percent for maximum load and 1.1 and 1.2 percent for maxi- mum deflection. As indicated, all the tests were similar and comparison of the Cy seems valid. Of special note are the very low Cy's (0.0 to 1.9 percent for maximum load) in the biomechanical tests of the Blue dummy. Data were not available to compare the reproducibility of the two dummy types in the low speed test. In the high speed test, the reproducibility in maximum load was comparable at 5.0 percent for HSRI and 4.2 percent for Hybrid II. The HSRI (at 0.4 percent) appeared significantly better than Hybrid II (at 5.9 percent) in reproducibility of maximum de- flection, based on the 5 percent difference rule. However, the HSRI chests bottomed out. LOWER LIMBS - Each HSRI knee was impacted three times according to the DOT test procedure (7). Results are given in Table 8, along with Hybrid II data. The HSRI structure was much softer than that of the Hybrid II (838 lbs compared with 2296 lbs). The HSRI knee flesh, which was much thicker than Hybrid II knee flesh, may account for the peak load difference. The difference in material properties would also be important. The outer skin suit of the HSRI dummy would further soften the impact and increase pulse duration. Of 18 Hybrid II dummies (36 legs) sampled, the most re- peatable leg did not vary measurably in peak load or dura- tion for the three tests. The best HSRI leg had a Cy of 0.7 percent. Consequently, the HSRI and Hybrid II dummies were comparable in repeatability. A coefficient of variation for the means of all four HSRI femurs was 2.9 percent, while the corresponding Hybrid II (36 femurs) value was 5.6 percent. Thus, the HSRI was also comparable in reproducibility to the Hybrid II dummy.</page><page sequence="15">HSRI/GM BIOFIDELITY RECOMMENDATIONS/HYBRID DUMMY 2325 The initial test on a Hybrid II knee sometimes gave sub- stantially different results than all subsequent closely spaced tests on the same knee. The HSRI knees did not show this break-in characteristic. INJURY CRITERIA IN SYSTEMS TESTS The HSRI dummy was tested in barrier crash simulations using two types of production hardware: three-point lap- shoulder belts and air cushion restraint systems (ACRS). The results from these tests were compared with results previ- ously obtained for the Hybrid II dummy in similar tests. THREE-POINT LAP-SHOULDER BELT TESTS - The pur- pose of these tests was to compare the injury criteria values and the repeatability and reproducibility of those values from the HSRI dummy with results from identical three- point lap-shoulder belt tests conducted using Hybrid II dummies. Test Description - Six sled tests were conducted on each of the HSRI dummies using an open test fixture with a rigid supporting structure to simulate the right front passenger position of a 1973 Vega. Emergency-locking rectractors were used on the shoulder belt while a 5 lb preload was applied to the lap belt by an automatic locking retractor. A new cloth seat was used in every test. The pulse shape simulated a 30 mph Vega barrier impact with a peak acceleration of 37 g's and a total velocity change of 34 mph. The HSRI dummy targets were positioned as close as possible to coordinates used with the Hybrid II dummy. However, there were minor differences in the location of targets on the two dummy types. The shoul- der belt was positioned carefully to prevent the belt from riding up underneath the arm. Dummy instrumentation in- cluded: 1. Head accelerometer - one Endevco-Triaxial 2267C-750 2. Chest accelerometers - one triaxial cluster consisting of three Endevco-Uniaxial 723 1C-750. Data Handling - The results were evaluated in terms of head injury criteria (HIC) and chest severity indices (CSI). The data are shown in Table 9. Means and coefficients of varia- tion were calculated for each HSRI dummy. These values are compared to corresponding Hybrid II injury values in Table 9 - HSRI Dummy Injury Criteria in #-Point Belt Tests Test No. Dummy HIC CSI 53553 Blue 650 560 53554 Blue 730 590 53555 Blue 790 510 53556 Blue 790 490 53557 Blue 750 500 53558 Blue 700 460 Mean Blue 735 518 Std.

The typically low pelvic accelerations and femur loads are of little concern as related to injury hazards in belt system tests and are not discussed here. In all six of the tests for the Blue dummy and in three of the six tests of the Gold dummy, the HIC was calculated based on the main restraint pulse, although a rebound pulse was always present. In the remaining three tests of the Gold dummy (S3564, S3566, and S3567), the computer algorithm included the main pulse and the rebound pulse in the HIC calculation. A visual examination of the resultant head ac- celeration-time records, by overlaying, showed tests S3566 to be virtually identical to S3568. Yet, in the former case, the HIC was based on a 15 1 ms interval, and, in the latter case, it was based on a 68 ms interval. The former case in- cluded the rebound pulse, the latter case did not. In order to separate the dummy response to the system from the inconsistencies of the evaluation tool, the HIC's were recalculated for these three runs with the calculation restricted to the main pulse. Both values are given in Table 9, but the statistics are all calculated based on the latter values. This led to a réévaluation of similar data for the Hybrid II. Of the 48 tests used, only 45 were recovered. In nine of these 45 cases, the HIC calculation had included a rebound pulse. Five of these occurred with one dummy (No. 30) and three with a second dummy (No. 11). The data for these nine tests were reevaluated, restricting the HIC to the main pulse only. The data in Table 10 are based on the revised HIC's . The effect was to lower the mean value from 937 to 924 and to lower the Cy from 5.7 percent to 3.3 percent. Test Results - The HSRI average HIC value (809) was 88 percent of the Hybrid II HIC (924) and the HSRI CSI (484) was 2% greater than the Hybrid II (473). The individual coefficients of variation, shown in Table 10, indicate that the HSRI and Hybrid II have equivalent repeat- ability in chest severity index (1.4 percent versus 3.3 percent) and HIC value 7.4 percent versus 4.5 percent). The statistics are biased in favor of the Hybrid II due to larger sample size, since the best case was used. Comparison of reproducibility of the two dummy types (Cy of the mean values, Table 10) shows that the Hybrid II is more reproducible in HIC (3.3 percent versus 12.9 percent) while not significantly different in chest severity indices (7.8 percent versus 9.9 percent) from the HSRI dummy. Table 10 also gives the better case of repeatability and the</page><page sequence="17">HSRI/GM BIOFIDELITY RECOMMENDATIONS/HYBRID DUMMY 2327 reproducibility obtained by HSRI in their three-point tests of the dummies. The values given in Table 10 were calcula- ted from data in Ref. (1). The repeatability and reproduci- bility reported were better than GM achieved for the HIC. They were comparable for the CSI. Also, the level of injury criteria was much lower in the HSRI conducted tests. The lower level injury criteria resulted from a much milder HSRI sled deceleration pulse-20 g peak versus 37 g. The less severe environment would likely induce better repeatability as well. Another contributing factor was the uniform hard seat configuration used by HSRI while GM used new pro- duction hardware in each test. AIR CUSHION RESTRAINT SYSTEM TESTS - Test De- acription - Six air cushion restraint systems (ACRS) tests were conducted with the HSRI dummies. Each dummy was tested three times in both the driver and right front passen- ger positions. A Hybrid II was used in the center front po- sition, since this position needed to be occupied in the test configuration for comparison purposes. The purpose of these tests was to determine the repeatability and repro- ducibility of the HSRI dummy and the level of injury cri- teria indicated in the ACRS environment. Dummy durabil- ity and usability were also noted. The results of these tests were compared with those of 1 6 identical air cushion tests on four Hybrid II dummies. All car parts used were from the 1974 Oldsmobile "C" body ACRS with the exception of an early version instrument panel tie bar and knee restraint which tended to give higher femur loads than the production design. Also, an early ver- sion passenger air cushion cover was used. The HSRI dummies were positioned as close as possible to the coordinates used in the Hybrid II tests. Since the H-point target was sewn on the HSRI dummy outer skin suit, that target was not considered to be accurate. The setup was based mainly on a plywood knee template and head coor- dinates. Each HSRI dummy's instrumentation included: 1. Head accelerometer - one Endevco Triaxial 2267C-750. 2. Chest accelerometer - one triaxial cluster of three Endev- co-Uniaxial 7231C-750. 3. Femur load cells - two GSE model 2430. A typical full size car acceleration pulse was used simulating a 30 mph barrier impact. The peak acceleration was 20.5 g's with a change in velocity of 34 mph. Data Handling - Results of the tests are presented in Table 1 1 . There were several irregularities in the head acceleration data that required special handling and a degree of interpre- tation. First, there were noises on some of the traces (Blue N4097, Blue N4100, and Blue N4101) which definitely ap- peared to be ground interruptions of the signal. They were of short duration, 5 ms or less. The data were approximated for the interruption interval by a straight line from the be- ginning to the conclusion of the interruption. The second irregularity of the data came from two causes. First, the Blue dummy differed drastically in its kinematics in the driver position from the Gold dummy. In all three runs, the Gold dummy submarined severely, and upon re- bounding, struck the rear of its head on the door, causing a rebound pulse on the acceleration data. (The fact that this impact was on or near the rear opening of the head raises the questions on the advisability of that opening even in frontal tests such as this.) The Blue dummy submarined and tended to move toward the door but did not hit the door hard enough in any test to cause a rebound pulse. These dif- ferences in the kinematics of the two dummies were docu- mented on the high speed films of the tests. The differences were also accentuated in the data analysis, since the HIC for the Gold dummy included the rebound in two cases (N4101 and N4102) and in a third case (N4103) was based only on the rebound. Only one rebound pulse occurred in the right front passenger position. In that case the HIC settled on the main pulse. In order to get HIC for the driver position for repeatability and reproducibility comparison purposes, the data were reanalyzed with the rebound pulse excluded. Both values are given in Table II, but the latter, rebound excluded, was used in the analysis, since it indicated how the dummy interacted with the air cushion. The Hybrid II data had one case where the HIC included a rebound. It was reanalyzed as above. Injury Criteria Levels - HIC values, chest severity indices (CSI), and femur loads were compared with those obtained from the Hybrid II (Table 12). For the driver, the HSRI average HIC value (295) was 2% greater than that for the Hybrid II (290), and the CSI average was 16 percent (327 compared with 282) greater. The right femur load was 75 percent (1090 lbs compared with 1458 lbs), and left femur load was 60 percent (863 lbs compared with 1436 lbs) of comparable averages for the Hybrid II. For the right front passenger, these values were 85, 96, 80, and 66 percent, re- spectively, of the corresponding values of the Hybrid II. Thus, the HSRI dummy overall gave lower levels of injury criteria than the Hybrid II. Table 12 also shows HSRI reported data (1). The injury numbers reported by HSRI are considerably higher than those obtained in this study. The sled deceleration pulses were similar, so the differences can be attributed to the differences in the air cushion environments, including prein- flation for the HSRI conducted tests. HSRI did not report femur loads. Repeatability and Reproducibility - The best coefficients of variation for each dummy type for each injury value (Table 12) show that, in the best cases, the Hybrid II dummy had superior repeatability in right front passenger's HIC. The large difference in variation (5.1 percent versus 18.2 percent) may be due to a less detailed HSRI dummy position- ing procedure using the head tairget and knee template only. The two dummy types were not significantly different in re- peatability for other right front passenger or driver injury values. The reason for the relatively large Cy (15.3 percent) for the Chest Severity Index (CSI) obtained by HSRI was not determined. The lack of kinematic reproducibility in the driver position has been noted qualitatively.

The reproducibility of the HSRI was very poor in HIC and Right Femur Load for both driver and right front passenger positions where Cy varied from 18.7 to 58.0 per- cent. Reproducibility of the Hybrid II was better in these positions, being 9.6 percent or less in each case. In the re- maining four parameters, CSI and Left Femur Load for both driver and right front passenger, the dummies were compara- ble in reproducibility. Paradoxically, the HSRI reported data had excellent repro- ducibility at 3.2 and 1.8 percent for HIC and CSI. It would be expected that their environment was more repeatable, since in their test a single lap-belted dummy occupying the center seating position impacted a preinflated air cushion. Undoubtedly part of the variation seen in GM tests was due to hardware, although similar hardware produced much better reproducibility in the Hybrid II dummy.

However, as was seen under the component test section of this report, the variation was not apparent in either the head drop or neck pendulum tests. The differences noted in kinematics might be explained by differences in dummy lumbar spines, which were not inde- pendently checked. The lumbar spine could also unknow- ingly have been out of position in a test.</page><page sequence="20">2330 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL. Findings based on the GM conducted ACRS tests are: 1 . Overall, the Hybrid II dummy was significantly more reproducible than the HSRI dummy in an ACRS environ- ment. 2. The Hybrid II was slightly more repeatable than the HSRI dummy in the air cushion environment. 3. The HSRI dummy gave significantly lower femur loads and somewhat lower HIC than the Hybrid II. DURABILITY AND UTILITY DURABILITY - Durability problems were noted for the HSRI dummy in four areas: i) the outer skin or suit, ii) the shoulder structure, iii) the lumbar spine, iv) the hand. Outer Skin - During the three-point restraint system test, the shoulder belt tore the suit in the upper chest area where the belt rubbed, even though chamois padding covered this area. The buttocks area of the suit was torn on hard seat tests at Wayne State University. Curiously, neither HSRI nor any other automobile company testing lab has indicated this is a problem. Realistically, the "skin" should be made to withstand a more severe environment than this. In com- parison to the Hybrid II, which withstands many repetitions with no damage to the skin, the HSRI skin is much too fragile. Further, the outer skin does not appear to be re- pairable. Since it is not sectioned, the entire suit must be replaced when a major tear occurs. Shoulder Assembly - The shoulder assembly is held together flexibly by rubber/cord ply "cartilage" (no measurable bio- mechanical fidelity intended). During a three-point restraint test simulation, the right shoulder severed on the Blue HSRI dummy (Fig. 11), and partial tearing of the shoulder mater- ial was visible on the HSRI Gold dummy. HSRI said that the orientation of the "cartilage" ply affects tearing strength. The joints were repaired with correctly positioned rubber/ cord ply material supplied by HSRI. No further three-point belt sled tests were run with HSRI dummies to verify the fix. No shoulder deterioration was visible following the six air cushion sled tests. Compared with the Hybrid II shoulder, the HSRI shoulder appeared to be too fragile. It should be designed to survive sled tests under belted conditions which are more severe than used in this program. Lumbar Spine - Crumbling of the lumbar spine was apparent after the first week of testing. No end plates are provided to prevent the cable from abrading the urethane (Fig. 12). Hands - Sierra 292-1050 hands are used on the HSRI dummy. On two occasions, the hands broke off at the wrist. The Hybrid II uses Alderson VIP-50A hands and has no history of hand/wrist breakage at GM. UTILITY - Handling and positioning were difficult with the HSRI dummy. No attachment point is provided for lifting the dummy. HSRI positioned the dummy on a sled fixture using the shoulder as a reference. At GM projected light target coor- dinates are used for positioning. The HSRI dummy would have to be fitted with anatomically fixed, visible hip, knee, and ankle targets to allow this type of positioning. There was no provision for thigh rotation at the hip. This severely limited flexibility in dummy positioning. The ankle- to-ankle horizontal distance determined knee-to-knee dis- tance. For this reason, it was not possible with the HSRI dummy to duplicate the setup of the Hybrid II in sled fix- ture test. The limitation could affect knee impact during sled testing. Compared with Hybrid II, adjustment on the HSRI dummy is required less often, especially maintenance of joint friction. Other characteristics of the HSRI dummy raise questions about its usefulness and fidelity in system test programs. The head cannot be easily ballasted to adjust its inertial proper- ties. Further, the rear opening of the head made data ob- tained from impacts in this area questionable. As was indi- cated previously, the rear of the head hit the left door of the vehicle as the dummy rebounded from the driver air cushion in the ACRS tests. In some cases, this rebound pulse influ- enced the HIC calculation. The neck allows no rotation about its own axis. In ACRS tests the Hybrid II dummy exhibited a large rotation of the head about the longitudinal axis of the neck, and it has a relatively stiff, hard rubber neck. It would seem that capa- bility for rotation about a longitudinal axis should be pro- vided. Fig. 11 - Severed shoulder assembly "cartilage"</page><page sequence="21">HSRI/GM BIOFIDELITY RECOMMENDATIONS/HYBRID DUMMY 233 1 Fig. 12 - HSRI dummy "lubar spine" The lumbar spine is loosely held into place (Fig. 12). With the skin suit on the dummy, it could not be determined if the lumbar spine is properly seated on its base. This could have been a contributing factor in the lack of reproducibil- ity in the ACRS tests. Finally, the finish of the skin suit appears to be quite slick. LeFevre and Silver (8) have shown that friction between the dummy and seat plays a significant role in dummy kine- matics in system tests. While realistic frictional coefficients have not been determined, subjectively, the coefficient of the HSRI dummy appears to be too low. It was clearly lower than the Hybrid II dummy in its garment. SUMMARY BIOFIDELITY - HSRI's final report (1) indicates the dum- my met HSRI's biomechanical design objectives for the head, neck, and chest. It was tested by GM against GM criteria and was judged here in light of those criteria. Failure to meet the GM criteria does not refute HSRI's claim to have met different biomechanical goals established by them. The head of the dummy was slightly soft in response to hard impact for biomechanical fidelity. The head had excel- lent repeatability in impact tests. It had good damping for hard impacts but rang excessively when impacting breaking glass. (This is a very serious deficiency, since glass breakage is a likely environment for dummies.) The mass of the head and the mass moment of inertia were slightly high. The neck attachment point was too low, the face was too narrow, and the chin was recessed too much for accurate head anthropo- metry. The neck satisfied biomechanical requirements in extension except that the maximum torque reached was slightly low. The repeatability in extension was very good. The response of the neck in flexion was near the requirements, and the neck could probably be tuned to meet the requirements with- out a major effort. However, there was a severe repeatability problem in the flexion tests, apparently due to chin-chest, chin-clavicle, or belt-chest interaction and not the neck. In the low speed blunt frontal impact chest test, the load was low while the deflection was satisfactory. The damping was greater than in currently used dummies but still inade- quate. The repeatability in this test was excellent. In the high-speed chest impact, the load level was low and the damping was inadequate again. The deflection was exces- sive with the chest bottoming out. The dummy chest ex-</page><page sequence="22">2332 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL. hibited very good repeatability and reproducibility in the high-speed test partially due to the bottoming of the sternum. In spite of the above mentioned deficiencies, the HSRI dum- my appeared to have better overall component biomechanical fidelity than the Hybrid II dummy. However, the HSRI dum- my is not considered to have adequate component biofidelity to make meaningful measurements for injury predictions in system tests. While adequate component biofidelity is neces- sary for meaningful measurements in system tests (belts, air cushions, etc.), it is not sufficient to assure the capability of injury prediction. REPEATABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY - Component tests are useful for establishing the repeatability and repro- ducibility of a dummy component in a dynamic environment. The HSRI dummy was compared with the Hybrid II in these tests. These two dummy types had comparable repeatability in seven of eight categories. The HSRI had better repeatabil- ity in the eighth, a quasi-static joint test. The dummies had comparable reproducibility in three of six parameters. The HSRI dummy was superior in the remaining three parame- ters: head response, chest deflection, and joint characteris- tics. Repeatability and reproducibility may also be examined in system tests in terms of injury criteria. Paradoxically, the Hybrid II had better results in these tests. They were com- parable in repeatability in both measures (HIC and CSI) used in the three-point harness test. In the ACRS tests the dum- mies had comparable repeatability in seven of eight measures; the Hybrid II was better in the remaining one (right front passenger HIC). The Hybrid II had better repeatability, there- fore, in one of ten total system measures. The Hybrid II had better reproducibility in four of eight measures (HIC and right femur load for both occupant positions) in the ACRS tests and one of the two (HIC) in the three-point harness tests. The dummies were comparable in the remaining five. In some cases the advantages of the Hybrid II were over- whelming. In summary the HSRI dummy exhibited slight repeatability and stronger reproducibility advantages in component tests, while the Hybrid II was superior in both in system tests. Apparently there are problems in integrating the components of the HSRI dummy into a total structure which is repeatable and reproducible. INJURY CRITERIA - The system tests also allowed the dummies to be evaluated for the magnitudes of injury criteria produced. Again, the HSRI dummy was compared to the performance of the Hybrid II. Overall, the injury values for the HSRI dummy were about 5% less in the three-point har- ness tests and 15 percent less in the ACRS tests than the Hybrid II. The most significant differences were in the femur loads in the ACRS tests. The HSRI loads were 37 percent and 22 percent less in the left and right femurs, respectively, than the Hybrid II. USABILITY AND DURABILITY - Installation of instru- mentation was generally difficult. Special tools and tech- niques could be developed to alleviate this. Handling pro- cedures are also needed, since no hook points were provided. Skeletal targets are needed for accurate positioning of the dummy. The joints were excellent; and the lack of a need for adjustment saves time and more accurately defines the joint response characteristics for test setup. The large open- ing in the rear of the head is objectionable since impacts to this area frequently occur, even in basically frontal testing. The outer skin suit was easily torn and apparently nonre- payable. A shoulder and hand failed during testing, and the lumbar spine deteriorated significantly. CONCLUSIONS This HSRI dummy is not developed to the extent that it can be recommended for use in vehicle qualification tests at this time. In particular, its severe reproducibility problems in system tests would make results from this test device very tentative. It has a number of durability problems which would jeopardize test results. Further, the effect of pro- ducing the dummy in substantial quantity is not known at this time. However, many of its components offer viable alternatives for future dummy development.

HESS AND JOHN W. MELVIN Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan THE GENERAL MOTORS PAPER presents summary re- sults of an apparently extensive testing program on the two original prototype models of the HSRI crash test device. The test results are analyzed and it is concluded that "this HSRI dummy is not presently developed to the extent that it can be recommended for use in vehicle qualification tests at this time." HSRI has repeatedly made the same recommendation (1)* stating that its test device is not fully enough developed for such use, and is not aware of any recommendation calling for such use. Many of the comments made in the paper deal with subjects which HSRI has been aware of and conform with HSRI's recommendation that development continue toward the goal of achieving a much needed compliance test device having both the qualities of adequate human-like bio- mechanical responses and high repeatability and reproduci- bility of test results. However, some of the results obtained in the GM testing program appear to be at variance with the results obtained at HSRI and in a testing program which was similar to the GM program, carried out on two other HSRI dummies by Calspan for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2). It is the purpose of this discussion to comment on the findings reported in the GM paper and to clarify, where possible, the sources of variance between the test results of the three test programs. BACKGROUND The HSRI crash test device was designed, developed and tested at HSRI in a period of approximately one year. At the end of that period the original two prototype dummies were made available to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Associa- tion sponsoring companies for independent evaluations of their performance. During the evaluation period the two dummies were transferred from one company to another and were not returned to HSRI until after all company evaluation testing had been completed. The first company to receive the two HSRI dummies was Ford, followed by GM, then Chrysler and AMC. The dummies were then returned to GM for fur- ther testing. At only one time during the evaluation period, when the dummies were at Chrysler, was anyone from HSRI present to examine the condition of the dummies. At that examination, improperly assembled leg joints on one leg of one dummy were noted and corrected. It was evident that disassembling and reassembling the dummy components were part of the evaluation tests performed on the dummies even though no adjustment is required in this dummy by design. COMPONENT EVALUATIONS HEAD - The primary criticisms of the head structure of the HSRI dummy put forth in the GM paper are based on two ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. aspects of dynamic performance, namely: ringing of the head as a result of a 48 inch drop test through a tempered glass panel and the inadvisability of using a back-of-the-head opening for insertion of the instrument package. HSRI has observed the same ringing or oscillation under conditions of step function like unloading of the head in those heads de- livered with the prototype dummy. The original HSRI head development produced a hollow urethane head shell which matched the longitudinal and lateral driving point impedance curves of human heads very well when contrasted with metal shell heads. The shell cavity was filled with a silicone gel having physical parameters very much like that of a human brain. Because of a feeling that such a gel-filled head might be difficult to work with, a last minute change to a solid urethane head was made as shown in Fig. 1 a. The current HSRI recommendation would be to return to the original HSRI head with a revised instrument package in- serted from a rigid mount which would terminate as the top plate of the neck structure as shown in Fig. lb. HSRI feels this concept would better preserve the human-like dynamics of the head and eliminate the oscillations seen when the head is subjected to very high rise time loading pulses. The delivered version of the head appears to be tolerant to load onset rates producing acceleration rise times of 1 00 g/msec but intolerant to 500 g/msec response rise times. The ap- parent deficit of a rear head opening is that with it, it is not possible to maintain a uniform head compliance which may result in undue reaction to blows near the opening. The opening was introduced as a convenience feature which now seems poorly advised. HSRI concurs with the authors on the desirability of design changes to alleviate these two problem areas. The GM paper also comments on the geometry of the HSRI head, its center of mass position and polar moment of inertia about a lateral, center of mass axis. The human head neck system involves a set of articulations below the head proper. As the GM authors declare, "no standards exist for upper neck pivot placement" and, to date, different groups have used different philosophies in their choice of an upper pivot position. It is difficult to determine if the authors are rec- ommending that the HSRI head base is 1 .0 inch too low (by GMR guidelines) or if the upper pivot point is considered as too low. Are there GMR guidelines for pivot location rela- tive to the head center of mass? NECK - The GM paper comments on the flexion behavior of the HSRI dummy neck as follows: "This neck has been favorably compared with the Mertz criteria by Melvin (6). Fig. 5 [Mertz form plot of flexion response of HSRI neck] would seem to refute that. The assertion apparently comes from tests on a small sled in- volving a head and neck only; whereas, the Mertz require- ment involves entire dummy system tests (4)." In the Melvin paper the point was made that it was pos- sible to compare the HSRI neck performance in flexion with Run 79 of LMP which exhibited a sled pulse with an average trapezoidal plateau deceleration of 9.6g with a velocity of 21.8 ft/s. To carry out the comparison Melvin used a neck-head laboratory sled with a trapezoidal input</page><page sequence="24">2334 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL. SKULL-^ GEL Fig. 1 - Schematic representations, a - Present HSRI dummy head, b - Prepared revision of head pulse of 9.5g plateau with a velocity of 2 1 .3 ft/s. Melvin compared head angular acceleration versus head/torso angle, resultant linear head accelerations versus time, and occipital condyles moment versus head/torso angle. Other than to plot the occipital condyles moment versus head/torso angle Melvin made no comment or judgment rela- tive to the Mertz flexion criteria. Melvin did however state that, in extension, the moment at the occipital condyles produced by the HSRI neck "matches the suggested response envelope of Mertz." Melvin's stated criteria of judgment of head-neck response were: 1 . The range of angular motion of the head relative to the torso. 2. The trajectory of the c.m. of the head with respect to the torso. 3. The angular and linear accelerations of the head produced during the head motion. In fact then, Melvin rather pointedly did not make any judg- ment based upon the Mertz criteria in flexion. Tests which have been performed since the development of the HSRI neck using it mounted in a conventional test dummy have shown a tendency for the resulting moment at the occi- pital condyles to enter the "Mertz loading corridor" at ap- proximately 35°-40° head/torso angle. A phenomena which two of the GM paper authors do not consider important when discussing the GMR neck simulation performance in flexion since, as they state (3): "the coordinate of the bottom of the loading corridor (20° , 0 ft-lb) was arbitrarily chosen." Analy- tical studies of a simple neck model done at HSRI indicate that an angular displacement of the neck base mount relative to the torso of about 15° during a flexion test can produce significant delays in the head/torso angle at which entry into the loading corridor occurs. Thus, some of the dummy orien- tation and constraint procedures used in the neck performance tests in the GM study may have had adverse effects on the ability of the HSRI neck to enter the loading corridor. This also suggests that the sensitivity of the neck mounting portion of the dummy (upper spine) should be reexamined and per- haps this humanlike performance characteristic should be specified. Examination of the original Mertz and Patrick paper (4) yields a set of data supporting the idea that volunteer dy- namic deflection of 70° is tolerable and that the pain thres- hold is 44 ft-lb. torque (at the occipital condyles). Based only on this it is difficult to understand the argument that lateness in coming into the loading corridor is particularly significant, this being aside from the logical explanation of predictable lateness as argued above. But the joining of the two arguments is interesting for, if lateness of entering the corridor is due to torso upper cervical rotation, then corres- pondingly, the dynamic deflection tolerance is pushed out. Lastly, since we are at least tangentially discussing the Mertz criteria, and since the GM paper makes a point of the poor repeatability of the HSRI neck in flexure "damping" we should comment on the Mertz concept of "damping". Presumably the ratio of positive unloading area to positive loading area is used because (1) the areas have the same di- mensions as energy and (2) because it is desirable to absorb energy to avoid extension response to flexion testing. It may be interesting to examine the energy flow in a mathematical model using physical data from Culver (5) and the criteria of Mertz (4). That is, a model with correct head mass, inertia, dimensions and a neck of proper length that, when given the Mertz input, lies completely in thé loading corridor and has a ratio of said areas of 0.54. The energy flow is routed into three sinks represented by; (a) the torso restraining forces, (b) the torso-neck joint and (c) the head-neck joint. The later two are partially reversible sinks. Fig. 2 shows this en- ergy flow versus time and in the sub-figure the cumulative area of the occipital condyle moment versus head/torso angle curve versus time. The Mertz ratio is the ratio of measures A to B as illustrated. However, while having the dimensions of</page><page sequence="25">HSRI/GM BIOFIDELITY RECOMMENDATIONS/HYBRID DUMMY 2335 -Q 1 11 Tš 11 1 11 / ' 11 AREA UNDER 20 ' AREA UNDER / ' , CO 'LOADING'/ V U &lt; CURVE / 1 - s LlI 0._Lj/ / LlI / 160 "r T 140 - Vi '' ENERGY ABSORBED BY '' FORCES ACTING ON BASE '' 45.03% of Original Energy 120- U 100- '' m 80 • I 1 ^ 1 li.

The A/B ratio of 0.54 does not relate to any of the absorption processes as explained before. But whether there is a physical meaning to the areas or not, the fact that these ratios are not repeatable in flexion is a measure of non-re- peatable performance. The most reasonable explanation, to the authors, is that the chin-chest interaction was responsible -note that the 479 run achieved a greater angle at its peak moment than did runs 476, 478. This might indicate a more significant chin-chest penetration since the phasing of the head and torso motions does not allow the maximum angular displacements to have an unambiguous interpretation. If this were the case one would suspect that the positioning of the dummy is critical. CHEST - The loads produced by the HSRI dummy chest under the impact conditions used by GM are characteristic of the type of responses obtained by HSRI in its human cadaver thoracic impact tests as shown in Fig. 3. HSRI is aware of the fact that the relaxed state of an unembalmed cadaver thorax must be accounted for in extrapolating to the response of the live human and agrees that the stiffness of the HSRI dummy chest should be increased somewhat to account for this.</page><page sequence="27">2337 Table 1 - REPEATABILITY OF HSRI DUMMY TEST RESULTS (Coefficients of Variation) a.

SYSTEMS TESTS EVALUATIONS The authors of the GM paper level their harshest criticisms of the HSRI dummy based on the performance of the dummy in the systems test evaluations. In order to clarify the sources of performance variation which apparently led the GM auth- ors to their conclusions it is first necessary to delineate the differences in the systems test programs performed at HSRI, GM and Calspan. In the three point lap-shoulder belt tests the following test configurations were used: 1 . HSRI - rigid seat slightly padded with 25° from vertical seat back angle and 15° from horizontal seat pan angle. 2. GM - production Vega cloth covered seat. 3. Calspan - rigid seat slightly padded with a 15° from ver- tical seat back angle and a horizontal seat pan. In the air cushion tests the following test configurations were used. 1. HSRI - Maverick body buck and production seat, pre- inflated air cushion; dummy was placed in front center posi- tion and was lap belted. 2. GM - 1974 Oldsmobile "C" body, air cushion, knee re- straint and associated parts; dummy was in either driver or right front passenger position unbelted. 3. Calspan - same seat configuration as in belt tests, pre- inflated air cushion with knee restraint; dummy was unbelted. The dummies used in the HSRI testing program were basic- ally the same dummies supplied to the MVMA sponsors with the exception that the lumbar spine was of a completely dif- ferent design than the rubber cylinder and cable arrangement used in the final prototypes shown in Fig. 4a. The lumbar spine construction used in the HSRI tests is shown in Fig. 4b and consists of a main constant torque joint similar to the other joint designs throughout the dummy coupled with rub- ber sandwich elements tied to the thoracic spine. This design was changed after the test program due to sponsor criticism of the limited lateral mobility of the spine. The two dummies used by Calspan in the NHTSA test pro- gram were identical in design to the final two prototypes supplied to the MVMA sponsors but were manufactured a few months later. The sled pulses used by all three programs were a 30 mph velocity change but the HSRI peak deceleration was ~20G, the GM peak deceleration was ~37G and the Calspan peak deceleration was ~23G. REPEATABILITY - The results of the three test programs are summarized in Table 1 in the form of coefficients of vari- ation Cy for the more repeatable of the two dummies. In the belt tests, the repeatability as measured by each test group was generally the same and indicates the excellent repeatabil- ity level attained in the belt tests by the HSRI dummy. The Calspan study calculated the average coefficient of variation for all measured variables in the belt test at 5.9% with ad- justed data for the HSRI dummy while a similar study by Calspan on the Hybrid II dummy produced an average value of 14.1%. In the air cushion tests the repeatability as measured by HSRI and Calspan was similar for the HIC values but for the CSI values the repeatability between GM and Calspan were closer. The major difference in the air cushion tests seems to be the lower HIC repeatability as obtained by GM. The Cal- span study indicated that the average coefficients of variation for all measured variables in the air cushion tests was 13.2% for the HSRI dummy and 5.4% for the Hybrid II dummy. Calspan concluded that "the repeatability of the HSRI dum- my is substantially equivalent on an overall basis when com- pared with the GM Hybrid II dummy". REPRODUCIBILITY - The results of the three test programs are summarized in Table 2 in the form of coefficients of vari- ation of the mean values of the single valued measures of the test programs. Since the Cy calculations involve only two numbers (the mean value for each dummy) the values have low statistical confidence. The most striking feature of the data in Table 2 is the high values of Cy for the GM measure- ment of HIC. It is apparently this result which has led the GM authors to state that, "In some cases the advantages of the Hybrid II were overwhelming," and to refer to this as "severe reproducibility problems." These "problems" did not seem to crop up in the Calspan program and, indeed, the comparison of the two dummy mean values as calculated by Calspan (based on the concept of least significant difference) indicated that in only one case was there a significant differ- ence at the 5% level. This occurred in the belt test CSI val- ues and, interestingly enough, the same type of difference was apparent in the belt test CSI values for the Hybrid II dummy. It may be then, that the reproducibility problems encoun- tered by GM were due to factors other than variation in dum- my construction. In particular, as noted earlier in this discus- sion, HSRI found that improper reassembly of critical leg and hip joints had occurred to one dummy after leaving HSRI. Examination of Fig. 10 of the GM paper shows that the left and right joints of the gold dummy are obviously different in joint resistance. This was not the case when they left HSRI. In the case of belt tests the variation in joint resistance will not have as great an influence on dummy motion as it will have on an air cushion restrained dummy. In addition the low values of accelerations and loads produced by the ACRS in the GM tests (mean HIC of 300) would allow joint resistance variation to play an even bigger role in modifying the dummy response than in the more severe loading produced by the Calspan tests (mean HIC of 773).

AUTHORS' CLOSURE TO DISCUSSION THE AUTHORS WELCOMED the discussion of their paper by Drs. Hess and Melvin of the Highway Safety Research In- stitute. We feel that it is entirely appropriate for them to discuss our critique of the dummy developed by them under contract with the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) and guidance of the Advisor/Consultants group formed by MVMA. Although Drs. Hess and Melvin raised several interesting points, they do not present any arguments or additional data which would alter our interpretation of our test results or the conclusions and recommendations which were made in our paper. The discussion does raise several points which apparently required additional clarifica- tion. Our closure is directed at comments on some of these more germane points. BACKGROUND - There is a discrepancy in the test sched- ule presented in their discussion. General Motors had the two dummies for evaluation for one week after Ford and for two more weeks after Chrysler. American Motors had them last. The importance of this order of testing will be noted later. HEAD - Their discussion expressed some concern about the GM head geometry guidelines which were used to assess the shape of the HSRI head form. A complete description of these guidelines, along with guidelines for dummy head de- marcation and inertial properties, are given in Ref. (3) of our paper. NECK - There is some confusion whether or not HSRI claimed that their neck structure satisfied the performance requirements postulated by Mertz. In their Final Report [discusser's Ref. (2), page 2] it is stated "A neck has been developed that meets the Mertz Criteria." According to their Final Report (p. 61), this statement is supposedly sup- ported by the data from Melvin [author's Ref. (6)] which was the reference we choose to use because of its wider cir- culation. Whether or not HSRI meant to make this claim is a moot point. Our data definitely indicates that all the require- ments proposed by Mertz were not met when the dummy was tested in the same environments used by Mertz in his cadaver and human volunteer studies which serve as a basis for his performance requirements. There appears to be some confusion over the meaning and usefulness of the "damping" ratio described by Mertz in his performance requirements. The authors agree with the dis- cussers' position that this ratio does not describe the amount of energy absorbed by the neck structure. The terminology "damping" ratio appears to be a misnomer. Regardless of what the ratio is called, it does characterize dummy response data for comparison with the performance requirements pos- tulated by Mertz. The prescribed ranges for this ratio for the extension and flexion tests are extrapolations of human vol- unteer and cadaver data. Meeting these requirements are con- sidered necessary conditions but not sufficient for assessing the biomechanical fidelity of surrogate neck structures. SYSTEM TESTS - There is a discrepancy in the discussion as to the test conditions used by General Motors in their three-point harness and air cushion restraint system (ACRS) tests. As stated in our paper, the change in velocity of our sled for both types of test was 34 mph, not 30 mph as in- dicated in the discussion. The additional 4 mph is due to re- bound velocity which occurs in our 30 mph barrier collision. The peak sled acceleration for the GM three-point harness test was 37 g and 20.5 g for the GM ACRS tests. The rationale given by the discussers for the reproducibility problem encountered by GM in their ACRS tests needs ad- ditional clarification. They propose that the apparent lack of reproducibility could be attributed to the differences in the right and left joints which we noted for the Gold dummy and/ or the improperly assembled by joints noted by their personnel while the dummies were at Chrysler. Our examination of joint response characteristics was performed during the first week of evaluation. After this initial evaluation period, both dummies were sent to Chrysler per the schedule given at the beginning of this closure. While at Chrysler, both dum- mies were presumably inspected by HSRI personnel and "im- properly assembled leg joints on one leg of one dummy were noted and corrected." After the dummies were returned to General Motors by Chrysler, all of the ACRS tests were con- ducted as well as additional three-point harness tests. For all system tests, the joints of the HSRI and Hybrid II dummies were checked to see if they met the lg - 2g requirement of MVSS 208. Neither HSRI dummy was found to be out of compliance before or after any of the system tests. Since the HSRI dummy had a much more repeatable joint response than the Hybrid II dummy, we must conclude that if varia- tion in joint characteristics adversely affect the reproducibil- ity of a dummy in ACRS tests, then a greater variation should have been noted for the Hybrid II results than for the HSRI results. As indicated in our paper, we attribute the apparent lack of reproducibility noted for the HSRI dummies in our ACRS tests to lumbar spine/pelvis interaction which was not well controlled. The presentation of the CALSPAN evaluation of the HSRI dummy was of interest. Comparing their evaluation of the Hybrid II and HSRI dummy with ours, it is not surprising that differences in conclusions were reached concerning the</page><page sequence="30">2340 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL. repeatability and reproducibility of the dummy types, since the test environments and dummy hardware were not the same. This illustrates the need to thoroughly define the test environments, test procedures, instrumentation, and data analysis techniques used in making dummy and/or occupant restraint system evaluations if direct comparisons are to be made of supposedly similar tests conducted by different test agencies. General Motors considers this as one of the prob- lems which must be resolved for meaningful compliance testing of our vehicles. Another issue is the significance of the measurements obtained as they relate to assessing occu- pant protection. General Motors is currently pursuing an extensive research program in an effort to resolve both of these issues.</page></plain_text>
