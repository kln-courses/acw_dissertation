As myths are the carriers of belief and value systems, the mythological characters, the kinds of relationship existing between them, and the stage on which they act allow one to infer changes in the material world. An examination of myths can demonstrate how the two historical forms of subsistence, hunting and agriculture, are referred to in sets of beliefs, how the meanings of the myths have been shaped and are expressed, and furthermore, how their consolidation or their change is supported ideologically.

I When regarding mythology our view is like a zoom, for it can only focus on one single segment in the course of history. The discovery of a myth fixes and preserves its state at that particular time. Whereas the myth is essentially living and ever in motion, we confine it within the limits of our language and printed word. Whereas it is subject to the narrator's powers of expression and highly dependent upon his knowledge of and familiarity with sacred matters, we now read these written documents as if they were dogmatic texts. How- ever, collections of myths are always a matter of chance. Nevertheless, for the reader and interpreter they constitute a vital means of gaining knowledge about other belief and value systems. For oral cultures myths are the carriers of belief and value systems. They represent the significant whole in human experience, while giving it form and expression1. Myths provide a body of prin- ciples for human life and thereby constitute a framework for the preservation of time-honoured values as well as innovations. In this regard belief systems and values are affected by change as much as human life itself. They bestow life with structure and reenact it, although subtly and with that conservatism that can be peculiar to the de- velopment of religious and ethical belief systems. The image normally associated with our public confrontation with the indigenous inhabitants of North America is that of the Plains Indian. In fact, hunting bison on horseback on the prairies in the 18th and 19th centuries has led to a certain standardization of the appearance of these peoples. The forms of Plains culture which grew up in this way are late and very specific developments in a process which brought about a shift in the means of livelihood of the people. This process was triggered by the spread of the horse, and was 1 Lindberg (1998: 5) takes the phenomenological view in his interpretation of American myths, which he sees as being nature-bound: "Myths carry the belief and value systems in cultures with oral traditions - they represent a significant part of the essential expression of life. Hunting, farming, fire, thunder lightning, rain, hail storm and cosmic powers are some of the more prominent themes in Amerindian mythology."</page><page sequence="2">434 Sonja Ross thus initiated in the final analysis by European immigration. Until their final political and military defeat, indigenous societies depended for their subsistence mainly on hunting and crop cultivation. Despite the uniformity maintained by Raffaele Pettazzoni (1960) in his interpretation of hunting and crop raising cultures from the point of view of religious anthropology, these societies actually constitute a very wide spectrum, a mosaic of hunters and agriculturalists with many different and specific features. Nevertheless, these particular forms of subsistence have led to corresponding economic and technological features in the respective socie- ties, as well as shaping their mythical and religious worldview. But let us consider the two poles, agriculture and hunting, as the starting point for our study of myths. A distinct feature of hunting societies is that as a rule there is a master - or a mistress - of the animals, a mythical person who protects and owns the game animals. Moreover, he or she assigns fortune to the hunter. The animals in turn have a supernatural home near this person, and there is no clear borderline between animal and human. Animal figures in the mythology of hunt- ing societies behave like humans, and mythical heroes and transformers are often anthropomorphic beings with the form of an animal and the character of a human. The concept of the animals' supernatural home found expression as follows among the northern Algonkin, the Naskapi, and Montagnais, for ex- ample: The caribou lives in a big house in the mountains. The master of the caribous is partly human and partly himself a giant caribou. The caribous, so the story goes, live in their home during the summer and are sent by the master in the fall to provide game for the human hunters. If the hunters have observed the hunting taboos and obtained permission to hunt from the master of the animals, the animals may be hunted. The spirits of the caribous appear to the hunter in a dream and teach him their songs. In this way every Naskapi can attain a certain magic power. When an animal dies, its soul returns to its supernatural home (Herweg 1981:68). In agricultural societies in North America, on the other hand, the concept of a supernatural woman predominates, the maize woman or maize mother, who was the giver of maize to humans. Identified with the maize plant and represented in ritual as such, for instance in the form of a corn cob, the image as matter is, indeed, the metaphor of the cultivated crop itself. For example, in the mythology of the Sia, a Keresan-speaking group in the southwestern re- gion of North America, the mother of the Indians was also the mother of the maize. In the earliest times, so the myths tell us, humans lived from seeds and various kinds of grass. However, the maize mother wanted to feed them with maize. She prepared the fields and planted pieces of her heart. When maize grew up from them, she said, this maize has come from my heart and it shall be for my people like milk from my breasts (Boas 1928: 232, 276). Worldviews and systems of belief can tell us much about the economy and means of livelihood of a people. They reveal to us their relative impor- tance in the life of the people, and not only that, they also show us that this relative importance is subject to change. So in what ways are these two forms of subsis- tence, "hunting" and "agriculture", represented in the beliefs of the people, how is their significance given form and expression, and on what ideolog- ical basis do their stabilization or transformation depend? II In the field of North American studies, the prob- lem of classifying features in cultural landscapes, known as culture areas, has long been a subject of intensive investigation. These studies have pro- vided an important basis on which to work, but they need to be regarded critically for various reasons. The most important criticism is that a culture area cannot be considered without histor- ical dimensions, in other words the elements it represents in the 17th century are not the same as those it represents in the 19th century, for example. However, it is possible to distinguish different regions on a rough basis, although in the recent literature they refer to geographical rather than cultural regions. According to these large-scale geographical patterns, we have from north to south the Arctic and Subarctic region, from east to west the northeast and southeast, the Plains, the Southwest, the plateaus and high basins, California and the Northwest Coast. Accordingly, hunting cultures are found in northern and western North America, that is the Arctic and Subarctic zone, on the Northwest Coast, the Plateau and the Great Basin, California and the Plains. Some cultures were highly special- ized and forced by their natural environment into narrow material limits, such as the Arctic hunt- Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="3">Mythology as an Indicator of Cultural Change 435 ers who concentrated on seal hunting, or the Gosiute in Utah who had a specialized hunting and gathering economy in which small game was hunted. Thus, there were considerable differences be- tween the individual hunting cultures, and to group all North American hunters together would clearly be a mistake. Indeed, hunting was a primary or secondary element of subsistence and culture even in the more or less well-defined agricultural areas. This situation could be found in the Southwest among the agricultural Pueblo peoples of New Mexico and Arizona, on the lower Missouri among the Sioux- and Caddo-speaking groups, in the eastern woodlands of the north among the Iroquois and some groups of the Algonkin and Sioux, and in the south among the Muskogee and other language groups. Stylistic elements relating to hunting and agriculture are manifested in the respective reli- gious systems in these mixed regions. I regard a religious system as being composed of different factors as follows: first, a mytholog- ical framework; second, animation of the sacred through ritual performance; third, socioreligious organizations, which help to render myths and rites visible; and fourth, the external circumstances that demand ideological answers from such a religious system and thus enhance its development. Within the general geographical framework, classification by culture areas can be problematic, as has been mentioned, whenever the historical dimension is to be taken into account, beyond the status quo at any particular time. Firstly, the focus of the defined areas may shift from period to period, and secondly, cultural traits can change so radically that in a given period they might show a greater resemblance to cultures in other areas than to that of their own past (Steward 1963: 82 f.). Migrations, also triggered by European settlement, a variety of influences from direct or indirect cul- tural contacts, superimposition of cultural comp- lexes, and mutual penetration, or the spread of certain popular features result in a heterogeneous picture which strongly relativizes any systematic classification. If we wanted to describe the characteristics of hunting or crop raising cultures, it would never- theless be possible to produce a rough typology showing general tendencies, but this could in no way be considered as a valid detailed description. As Hultkrantz noted (1979: 144), a way of life based purely on hunting, on following and taking game, makes special demands on the mobility of the people. Following scattered animal tracks leads to social atomization with the mobile groups Anthropos 95.2000 existing side by side in a rather loose social organi- zation. The individual relies on his own strength or that of his guardian spirit. The necessity of main- taining the health and well-being of the group and of obtaining luck in hunting also implies personal responsibility with regard to the ritual function of the individual. A supreme god, a "silent" and withdrawn power, is responsible for assuring the security of the hunting existence and the duration of the world order and the life process. The west- ern Déné, for instance, believed in a vague way in a kind of impersonal and undefinable deity, who was almost identical with the heavenly powers, and was the effective cause of rain, snow, wind, and other atmospheric phenomena. The Apaches believed in a supreme being called the "protector of life," who exercised punitive retribution through the weather (Pettazzoni 1960: 57). Social structures are generally flat, although there are exceptions such as that of the spe- cialized salmon fishers on the Northwest Coast, who have a complex and hierarchical social order. With increasing complexity hunting societies show collective forms such as clans and secret so- cieties, where the members are considered to be related either through family connections or through membership of the society. Heraldic ele- ments are frequently seen in these clans or secret societies. For agriculturalists, on the other hand, complex ritual systems connected with sowing, ripening, and harvesting of the crops are characteristic. Communal life is dominated by agricultural rituals which occur in seasonal cycles and which give a fixed pattern to religious beliefs. The effectiveness of the medicine man is due to his social status rather than personal religious experience; he has the function of a master of rituals and is often a member of a medicine society. He is a priest and protector of traditions. This is most clearly seen in permanently settled societies which have become well-established with the help of this ritual complex. The apparent contrast between the way of life of hunters and agriculturalists diminishes if both lifestyles can be led, or at least if the one is not completely suppressed ideologically by the other. Thus the meaning of many a large ritual complex becomes clear only when viewed against the background of a change in its phaseological significance. In the southern half of the North American continent, hunting ceremonies have so much in common with agricultural rituals that reciprocal penetration is obvious. A characteristic complex</page><page sequence="4">436 Sonja Ross of rituals in the eastern woodlands was the "Green Corn" ritual, which was of greater importance than sowing or harvest ceremonies. The Green Corn ritual celebrated the removing of the kernels from the cob and in some cases the beginning of the new year as well. The healing powers of plants were commemorated, animals and field crops were sacrificed, and special rituals for certain individual crops were carried out (e. g., the bean ritual). At the same time ritual hunts were enacted and dances performed in which the spirits of slain animals were portrayed (Underhill 1948:28-34; Witthoft 1949: 83 f.). In some cases the agricul- tural ritual was carried out directly following the annual hunting ritual. In the case of the communal hunt, the similar- ities in the structures and forms of belief systems and rituals among agriculturalists and hunters are particularly great. Planning and executing commu- nal hunts requires considerable organization and experience. In areas where the quest for visions was of importance, responsibility lay chiefly in the hands of an experienced hunter, who was in possession of a supernatural helper, sacred songs, and cult objects. Apart from the Northwest, where communal hunts played a role in whaling and had an effect on the community (and there is no cultivation of crops), they are reported mainly from the agri- cultural areas, i.e., in the south, southwest, and southeast. Isolated examples of hunts in which game was driven into pens, such as the antelope hunts in the Great Basin, have been recorded. In suitable terrain they were carried out among the western Navaho and Hopi and they are reported of the Zuni, Isleta, Chiracahua, and Mescalero- Apache. The mounted bison hunts on the prai- ries and plains, which became common with the spread of the horse in the late 18th century and in the 19th century, have some communal traits. But more predominant and of greater ceremonial significance is the deer hunt complex in the region known as the "Greater Southwest." Here, in the southern United States and in northern Mexico, the opposing aspects of the two poles, hunting and agriculture have found their most striking manifestation in the deer-maize complex of rituals. The Huichol, for example, consider the deer as the most sacred of animals. Before the deer became almost extinct in the Sierra Madre Oc- cidental, no agricultural ceremony or important event could commence without being preceded by the ritual deer hunt (Myerhoff 1980: 136). Today maize is the staple food of the Huichol and it has become the central theme of their religion just like the deer. The magic power of deer is transferred implicitly to maize: thus it is said that the blood of the red deer makes the maize grow and enhances its food value. Carl Lumholtz (1902:43) has re- corded a myth which clearly indicates that maize was once the red deer. However, this transference of meaning should not be oversimplified, for the complex of symbols is additionally reinforced by the sacred peyote. Peyote is a variety of cactus containing mescaline and its hallucinatory effect is used in rituals. It is considered as divine and almost equal to the red deer. To enable humans to find peyote, the red deer comes down from heaven. Hence, peyote must be tracked down and ritually shot. The deer-maize-peyote complex is a composite of religious elements and meanings, which must be seen in their mutual relation. While the signif- icance of single elements correlate with historical developments in the way of life of the people, their inclusion together with other elements in a religious system abstracts the individual features and allows a complex of symbols to evolve. Ill Hunting and crop cultivation as economic foun- dations and ways of life are important themes in creation myths. The introduction of agriculture or hunting into the world, attainment of the necessary technologies, or the utilization of resources are ex- pressed in pictures and thus stored in the collective memory. In most mythologies in the agricultural zones of North America there is a more or less clear idea of a supernatural force, a female divine fig- ure who brought maize to the people. She plays an important role in the Pueblo region and also among the agricultural peoples of the Plains and in the eastern woodlands. The concept is especially prevalent in the southeast, although sources for reference there are sparse. Early conquests by the Spanish and French (from the 16th century) were later followed by willing attempts at acculturation on the part of the indigenous peoples under the influence of the Anglo-Americans. Archaeological research and travel journals have provided evi- dence of the existence of complex settlement struc- tures in the southeast from protohistoric times. The significance of plant cultivation in mythology is predominant. Likewise the hunt is anchored in mythology. In many examples it appears under the patronage, as one might say, of the maize goddess. Thus various Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="5">Mythology as an Indicator of Cultural Change 437 Creek myths treat the creation of maize and of the hunt by a maize woman (Swanton 1929: 9- 17, 168). She creates maize and beans by rubbing her own body and shaking herself. She sacrifices herself and demands that her body should be dragged back and forth over the prepared field. After three months maize would begin to grow out of the earth. In some tales she let herself be locked up with a corncob for four days. In these four days loud noises could be heard coming out of the room. When she was released the room was full of maize. A further important function of the maize woman is to teach her ward, an orphan boy, which animals can be hunted and eaten. She equips him with the clothes and the strength of the hunter and sends him out beyond the mountains to prove himself. Similar tales have also been recorded amount the Natchez. In a Cherokee myth (Mooney 1900:242-249; 1888: 98-106) the two poles of hunting and agri- culture appear in equal measure. They are repre- sented by Konáti, the successful hunter, and Selu, who is maize or the maize woman. Konáti is a master of the animals, a well-known metaphor in the sphere of hunting beliefs for a divine person who owns all the animals. Usually this person has to be propitiated so that he will send animals. This aspect is thus clearly related to the mythologem of the master of the animals. In our example, however, the animals are stolen from him and taken to the world of humans. The term "maize woman" is a metaphor for maize. She and Konáti are a couple and they have a son. An additional component is the "Wild Boy," who is a friend of the son of the divine couple and plays the malicious, irksome, but at the same time inno- vative part in the story of the creation of game animals and maize on earth. The boys observe how Konáti enters his animal pen to fetch some animals. They immediately open the gate and let all the animals run free. Finally they see the mother fetching corn and beans from the storehouse. They follow her and see her producing maize by rubbing her stomach and beans by rubbing herself under her arms. They think this is witchcraft and decide to kill her. Before she dies, she teaches them to prepare a field and to drag their bodies over the ground. The boys carry out what she has taught them, and wherever their blood wets the ground maize grows up. A Seminoie myth gives us particularly clear evidence and for various reasons also important evidence of the analogon of maize woman and maize: The maize women lived in the woods and were big, fat, and heavy. Their bodies were like Anthropos 95.2000 big corncobs; they rubbed their legs and corn fell to the ground. It is reported that a maize woman kidnapped a boy. Later she gave him four maize kernels, from each of which a big plant grew. That is how maize came into the world (Greenlee 1945: 141). Thus in the southeast, the maize woman plays a predominant role as producer and bringer of the crops. She is the culture heroine, as far as hunting and crop cultivation are concerned. To introduce the cultural goods she sacrifices herself. However, this should be seen neither as a blood sacrifice nor as a symbol. She is maize - no more and no less. She embodies it in the proper sense of the word. By reducing the metaphor to its literal meaning, we see that the mythical being and the cultivated plant are equal. The concept of the embodiment of the cultivat- ed plant is also found in the northeast woodlands. In a Seneca myth, a village suffered a severe famine following heavy rain and floods (the flood motif usually represents a break and is the sign of a turning point in the history of the world). One night a young man heard someone with a heavy tread walking up and down. This went on for thirty nights. On the thirty-first day a strange woman came to visit them. Nobody could say where she came from, for they were surrounded by water. When they asked her, she replied that she came from the south where her mother lived. Her mother had sent her to put an end to the famine. Finally she married the young man and gave corn to the whole village, but without anyone knowing how she did it. Then she was maltreated by the brother of her husband and she went away, back to her mother. Her husband followed her and found her in a house surrounded by fine cornfields. He was received kindly by his wife and mother-in-law, and when he left he was allowed to take seed corn for his starving village (Curtin and Hewitt 1918: 636-642). Thus maize came into the world with the maize woman and disappeared with her, and through her humans were able to get it back again. The myth also teaches us something about the culture of the matrilocal society in which it was normal for young men to marry into the families and property of their wives. The creation myth of the Seneca, however, gives a chronological sequence for hunting and agriculture. In earlier times there was a village situated on a river. There the people lived on meat and fish, berries, edible roots, and tubers. One day they heard a woman singing about the rich fields of her grandmother and her ancestors. The women</page><page sequence="6">438 Sonja Ross of the village were curious and went to the river, and sang welcoming songs for several days. The songs were finally answered from the other side of the river. Continuing the exchange of songs, the women who had no corn came closer to the mystical singers on the other side of the river. The latter became afraid and fled, except for the eldest, who wanted to help the humans. A young woman came towards her from the other side. She did this by lying on the back of a beaver who carried her to the middle of the river. There is no doubt that the beaver here can be seen as a metaphor for game to be hunted, and thus for the hunt itself. The old woman paddled towards her in her canoe and took her to the far shore, where the young woman turned into a maize plant overnight (Curton and Hewitt 1918:642-648). A woman from a village without any cultivated plants is carried by a beaver across a river, where she meets an old woman who finally transforms her into the cultivated plant. The Iroquois variants have a cosmogonie framework. Among the Huron the maize mother was identified with a woman who had fallen from heaven. In her two sons we can see an expression of the dualistic principle of good and bad. This kind of twins myth is widespread - not only in North America. The bad should not be seen primarily as a moralizing element. Rather it represents things that are irksome, or which break the rules, but which thereby bring about innovation: it is the bad son who kills his mother, thus allowing maize to be created out of her.2 The formulation of the maize mother as an embodiment is thus extended to include a compre- hensive worldview. In another example she is the daughter of the heavenly woman who was sent to earth, and for whom the earth was created. She becomes pregnant through the man laying a sharp and a blunt arrow on her, thus forming the good and the bad principle. The two unborn boys discuss in their mother's womb which way they ought to choose for their birth. While the good one chooses the natural way and becomes the creator of positive things, his brother chooses the direct way to the light through the mother's abdominal wall. This causes her to die, and maize grows out of her body.3 The Southwest maize cultivation complex is separated geographically by a nonagricultural zone from the eastern complex we have just considered. To the north of this zone, in the eastern woodlands, characteristics have developed which are distinct from the southern and western cultural patterns. This applies to various technologies such as the use of the hoe in post-Columbian times instead of the digging stick (Witthoft 1949: 3). However, the region known as the "Greater Southwest" is also marked by sociological, ideological, and economic fields of tension which have come about as a result of population groups with different forms of economy living close together. There, gatherer cultures (like the Shoshone in southern California) became established beside Pueblo agriculturalists (like the Hopi), temporarily mobile cattle breeders (like the Navaho in post-Columbian times), and pure hunters (like the Apache) to form a mul- ticultural area with a varying balance of power among the different groups, until far into the 19th century. Especially in the 14th and 15th centuries there were great population movements, which exposed the fast growing crop raising culture to new in- fluences and inhibited its further development. From the north came the Navaho and Apache who harassed the straggling, complex settlements. Long periods of drought most likely also had serious effects. Trade centers finally became deserted and the settlements were abandoned. Such migration movements and constant contact through trade or war with seminomadic Plains dwellers kept hunting traditions alive in the Southwest. The hunting component in the mythology of the crop raising Pueblo peoples is anchored in such a way that it points not to simple superimposition but to chronological depth and continuity. The hunting-agricultural complex in the South- west, including northern Mexico, appears to have developed as an organic whole and to have kept an equal balance between both for a very long time. Its central position between agricultural Mexico and the southeastern maize complex on the one hand, and the hunter-gatherer cultures bordering in the north and the west on the other hand, appears to have led to consolidation of both ways of life. The arrival of nomadic hunters in immigration waves finally reinforced the hunting elements again, at a time when the hunting complex had already started to retreat. The settled Pueblo societies had social and religious systems with extremely complex, inter- connecting structures. The worldviews formed by the priestly communities resembled a structure in which cultural development, all central aspects of life, and all beliefs existed together. As the following Zuni creation myth shows, hunters and 2 Hale Horatio, Huron Folk-Lore; quoted after Hatt 1951: 857. 3 Witthoft 1949: 80 f.; cf. Parker 1910: 36 f. and Cornplanter 1938:26-30. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="7">Mythology as an Indicator of Cultural Change 439 warriors played a decisive role: The mythical twin brothers of the Zuni are the sons of the sun father. They made their appearance when a sunbeam from the father touched the spray of a waterfall. They are warriors and hunters. In earliest mythical times they formed the world, de- stroyed monsters, and guided humankind through the different periods in world history (Benedict 1935: 51-56). Cosmogony and anthropogony pass through various stages which are symbolized by the picture of a layered world. At the beginning of creation there was an upper and a lower level. The lowest world was completely enveloped in darkness. Humans lived in holes in the ground and ate grass seeds. The creator god wanted to fetch the humans up out of the lowest world, and sent his twin sons to do this. They brought the humans up by repeatedly throwing up meat to build a road that was passable (Stevenson 1904: 23- 26). The idea of people living on different world levels is actually a symbol for different cultural levels. In this world there existed two kinds of beings: the "raw" and the "cooked" or "daylight people." The latter ate cooked food, while the "raw" people lived off uncooked food or the of- ferings of the daylight people. The complex of the "raw" includes the earth itself and those mythical figures that are associated with wild game, wild animals, and plants. These association complexes are symbolized by the kachinas, so characteristic of the Pueblo dwellers (Ross 1994: 148 f.). The divine brothers are guides, pioneers, and protectors of humankind. But they are not them- selves associated with maize, the cultivated plant. They first met maize on their travels in the upper world, and it came about in this way: The humans rested very often on their travels and built great stone houses. One day, at the fourth resting place on their long journey to the east, they met a clan called the seed people. The humans wanted to challenge this clan, but it refused to accept the challenge. The seed people said they had great strength but could only utilize it with the aid of the humans. Finally the two clans worked together, spent time in prayer and in ceremonial work, and planted maize with seven sticks. Out of these soon grew seven maize plants, which were called the sisters of the clan people (Cushing 1920: 17-54). The motif of the maize girls was widespread in the Southwest. Among the eastern Pueblos around the Rio Grande, the maize woman was a powerful goddess with creative competence. The similarities in content to the southeastern maize complex include a frequent motif which describes how maize is created by rubbing the body. The Anthropos 95.2000 maize girls bathe and rub their bodies, then they take the rubbed off substance and form corn crops out of it (Hatt 1951:860). In the Zuni creation myth this motif is transferred to the creation of the world by the sun god (Cushing 1920: 17-54). The cultural partitioning of the southwestern and southeastern agricultural complex and thus its separation was clearly a result of the immi- gration of the northern Athapaskan, the Navaho, and Apache. It was a significant event in the fields of linguistics and historical geography when Athapaskan-speaking groups were discovered so far south. Today this is a commonplace in North American studies. Let us now turn to the last of the cultural regions which I would like to treat briefly: the Plains. The inhabitants of the Plains became inten- sively engaged in hunting again with the mounted bison hunt, the characteristic external mark of their culture. This was triggered by the introduction of the horse by the Spaniards and the expansion of the European settled areas on the east coast. Conquest and settlement triggered large-scale migrations, in the course of which Algonkin- and Sioux-speaking groups advanced southward and westward into the Plains. The Europeans also opened up new opportunities which were willingly taken up by the other side: new technologies, new markets, new ways of life. But in the end the new arrivals were superior in strength and followed their own ideas of a civilized world. It took about 150 years from the beginning of the 17th century for horsekeeping to spread from New Mexico to the Saskatchewan area in present-day Canada. The horse was an asset to the population, allowing greater mobility and better hunting tactics. This led to a kind of "cultural rearrangement" among the new and old Plains peoples. Village societies whose economic and rit- ual life was still determined by crop cultivation as late as the 16th century abandoned their sedentary way of life, completely or in part, and became mobile. They lived in tepees and followed the vast herds of grazing bison (Ross 1989: 132-139). These planters in the regions of the upper Mississippi and lower Missouri, the Republican, Platte, and Loup river valleys were able to attain one last cultural floruit with the horse and the bison hunt. Together with the traditional bands of hunters who had migrated to the Plains from the Uto-Aztecan and Athapaskan speech areas, they left us as a legacy the figure of the proud Plains warrior on horseback. Indeed, careful study of the seemingly uniform Plains culture reveals clear echoes of former ways of life, which had been</page><page sequence="8">440 Sonja Ross practiced only a few generations earlier: on the one hand individual responsibility in matters of belief and ritual through the personal quest for visions and guardian spirits, together with a loose social organization; and elaborate metaphysical systems and complex social structures on the other hand. Among the agriculturalists the maize woman plays a significant role. She is known in the myths of the Cheyenne, Hidatsa and Mandan, the Pawnee and Arikara. The creator god of the Arikara planted maize in heaven, took a corncob and transformed it into a woman. Once again this is a clear indication: she is not just a symbol or a metaphor, but she is the embodiment of the maize, she is maize. The maize woman was sent to earth as a bringer of culture and she introduced maize cultivation (Hatt 1951: 861 f.). The maize mother is of central significance among the Pawnee, as can be seen in the excellent monograph on rituals by Alice Fletcher (1904). The "Hako" ritual and the role of the maize woman in it have a far greater significance than only a fertility function. "Hako" ensures the well-being of the community: fertility for the fields and for the people, long life and stable political structures in a dangerous world. In short, it ensures the prosperous continuity of human existence. The maize woman can also be a warrior chief in her role as protector. Among the Caddo-speaking Pawnee and Arikara the powerful position and dominance of the maize mother is comparable to that of the Keresan-speaking Pueb- los. This is not the only indication of a strong bond between members of the Caddo language family and the southern maize complex. With the rising importance of the bison hunt came the growing need for ideological broadening of the belief systems. In a number of myths the bison becomes an integral part of the belief system just like maize. A story told by the Cheyenne tells of two young men who visit a supernatural old woman. She shows them cornfields and bison herds. One of the men brings maize back with him from this visit and the other brings bison meat. The synthesis of the two economic factors is often expressed by the metaphor of "marriage": A young man marries both the maize woman and the bison woman. Inclusion of the hunting element in the belief system in this way has been recorded among the Skidi-Pawnee, the Omaha, the Teton Dakotas, the Cheyenne, and the Crow (Hatt 1951: 862 f.). Sometimes the motif of marriage follows that of decision-making: A young man was sitting on a hill, gazing at his surroundings. Suddenly two singing women appeared, one from the east and one from the west. They were the bison woman and the maize woman. They courted him and had brought moccasins with them as a gift. But the young man could not decide between them. When the two women each put a moccasin on him at the same time - one on his right foot and one on his left foot - he said, "I will choose both of you." Then he took both women to his home (Dorsey 1906:62-68). These are etiological motifs, which are meant to explain something. The less imposing variation of the maize woman is representative of the world view of agriculturalists. Its opposite, the bison woman, has been added to the motifs, although without the support of any religious or sacred aspects. The ideological foundation is lived by means of rituals. The ritual forms of the hunting-agriculture synthesis cannot be discussed at length here. It should suffice to mention a situation in which the symbiosis and also the relative value of meat and maize are illustrated dramatically. This was recorded during the second half of the 19th century among the Arikara and shows again the influence of the southern maize complex and its generic branches within the Caddo-speaking ethnic groups. A large corncob that had survived for generations was kept in a medicine pouch in such a way that it protruded somewhat. Whenever a celebration or festivity took place, the Arikara made offerings to the maize by rubbing it with a piece of meat, addressing it with the word "mother," and praying for a successful harvest (Matthews 1877: 12). IV Oral traditions cannot be used as a basis for mechanistic research into facts. The vitality and the deep-rooted abundance of the material stand in opposition to the relationship of facts in a strict historic sense. Many attempts to comprehend oral traditions as a form of history are actually a narrowing down of information rather than his- torical identification. But the student of myths can draw qualitative information from his material that will allow him to reach important conclusions: firstly regarding the chronology of change, sec- ondly regarding the quality of change, and thirdly regarding the results of change. Moreover, assistance in the dating of myths, at least for historical and protohistorical times, is provided by related fields such as archaeology, historical geography, linguistics, and the indica- tions found in "ethnographica," travel literature, and institutional archives. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="9">Mythology as an Indicator of Cultural Change 44 1 The spread of the horse, the westward advance of the Europeans and settlement of Indian terri- tories, the construction of railroads, wars against the Indians, and decimation of the population by epidemics brought about decisive changes in the life of the Indians in all areas within a relatively short space of time. These changes also affected the belief and value systems of the Indian cultures. The worldviews of those peoples who had been hunters or agriculturalists and whose life now took on a new focus due to internal or external conditions are correspondingly different. When belief systems are affected by changes which require expression, the question arises, what do the gods do when the world changes? For they represent the total expression of human life. They help to point it, to give it shape and expression. They put the whole of human experience in a form and sanctify it. So what do the gods do when there is a change in human experience? At first they remain unmoved, maintaining their external status and their emblems of power. It would be dangerous to touch them. They can be successfully challenged only when their power no longer enables them to stand firm in a changed world. And this can only happen when other conditions suddenly or imperceptibly gain control, when new values and meanings are formed, when new goals are necessary which change the wants and needs of humans. Then other divine figures with other symbols of power appear who better represent the spirit of the times and whose charac- ter provides appropriate answers to the questions of humankind. If these conditions are fulfilled, then the chal- lenges, struggles for power, and measuring of strength can take place. The struggle between the gods in mythology can be a typical indicator of cultural change and allows a new orientation or rearrangement of value systems in a sanctioned way. The following example (Ross 1989: 46 ff.; 132-149; 169 ff.) shows how the powerful eve- ning star goddess in the pantheon of the Pawnee had to admit defeat, although she occupied a far higher position and had much greater means of exercising power. The pantheon of the Pawnee had a strictly strat- ified hierarchical structure. The gods represented not only the stellar cosmos but also the essential elements of human life. At the top of the heav- enly power structure was a supreme god and his wife. He was the initiator and the designer of the creation. He ruled the universe through commands which he gave to the goddess of the evening star who was next to him in the hierarchy. The goddess Anthropos 95.2000 of the evening star was the mother of all things and the guarantee for never-ending resources. The symbiosis of agriculture and the hunt, of maize and bison, was consolidated in her. She owned a garden with an inexhaustible supply of bison herds and cultivated plants. Even the sun god had to come to her garden every evening to obtain new light and new heat. The special relationship of the goddess of the evening star to the spiritual power of the universe and her significance as mother of all things and inexhaustible source of life assured her the second place in the universe. "I am the one who creates all things," she says confidently, "humankind will honour me. When they hear the voice of the thunder, they shall know that in the thunderstorm are my helpers, whom I have sent out from their hut, and that it is within my power to strike the earth and humankind. Though I will give the humans seed from my garden, and I will give them all animals, yet there will be times when I shall strike and kill humans with my power." A whole series of myths describe how this goddess is overpowered and subjected by the god of war. Although equipped with far less power and fewer forces, he continually challenges her until in the end he conquers her. What had happened? Since at least the be- ginning of the 17th century the Caddo-speaking peoples were threatened by the hostile Apaches, who at a very early time already rode horses and who at the height of their power in the latter half of the 17th century had control of the Plains. Wars with the Apaches seem to have affected the southern Caddo groups more than those in the north; most slaves sold by the Apache and the Navaho in New Mexico and along the Mississippi came from the Wichita. The effects of change in the Plains region were varied: pressure on village societies caused a shrinking of their territories and forced the villagers to take to horses and arms as well. Finally they either had to build large fortified communities or become more mo- bile in order to encounter the marauding bands of hunters and warriors with like means. Both strategies are documented. However, as the Plains cultures became more uniform, the latter strategy became the more predominant one. Those who profited most from the disbandment of sedentary village communities were young men whose low birth hindered them from obtaining a prestigious position in the hierarchical society. For them there was only one possibility for social ascent: they sought fame and renown through success in war. They organized themselves in bands that accorded them the desired prestige, even though they were</page><page sequence="10">442 Sonja Ross considered as rivals or imitators of the established bands. For it is not that there were no institutions of war in the priest autocracy, under the banner of the evening star goddess. But when the warring and hunting activities of the Pawnee moved into the foreground, there were more opportunities for young men to achieve a higher status with the aid of new structures. Thus the god of war had actually conquered the old social structures and network of power, and his victory marked a new epoch. Thus myths are not unchangeable. On the con- trary, they can be varied to reflect humankind's concept of life. A myth preserves through time because it makes use of the language of images, and because it always seeks new images to answer old questions that keep recurring. The images are arranged in a chain of perceptible motifs, that ex- presses the beliefs, the mental reflections, and the concern for existential security of the people. Both the scenes and the figures involved can change. Myth makes human existence comprehensible and reflective. Müller (1956: 47 f.) has spoken in this connection of the "instability of figures, places, and motives"; the subject matter of myths may be wrapped in all kinds of mantles, without loosing its own shape. According to Müller, the myth is not "thought" but "seen", and has nothing at all to do with processes of conscious thinking. He was right that the myth can be seen and that its central ideas stand the test of time by means of adapting the figures. But he was wrong in wanting to reduce the myth to an inner "optical act" devoid of all rationality. The architects of myths are human beings in their need and search for answers. And thus hu- mankind has consciously and knowingly created myths. References Cited Benedict, Ruth 1935 Zuñi Mythology. Vol. 1. New York.
