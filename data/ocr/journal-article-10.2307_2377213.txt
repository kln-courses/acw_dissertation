<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER NOTICES SINS OF SCIENCE. By Scuddei Klyce. Boston: Marshall Jones Co., 1925. Pp. 432. Some three years ago, in Universe, Mr. Klyce undertook to indicate vari- ous fundamental errors in modem thought. Finding that "intellectuals," un- like worms, cannot grow new heads, he now addresses his message to the man in the street, brands as incompetent, scientists, philosophers, theologians, and teachers, and proposes to state the conservative principles that common men live by-contending among other things that Jesus is probably a myth and that immortality as survival of separate individuals is plainly illogical. Let us hope that Mr. Klyce is not a gregarious soul, for it seems certain that he is doomed to be a voice crying in the wilderness. This is not to say, however, that he does not deserve to be heard. As an observant mind outside of the academic tradition but by no means ignorant of recent developments in science and phil- osophy, he has many keen insights which should be interesting and valuable not to the common man but to the "intellectuals" whom he is criticizing. His fundamental doctrine is that words are gestures indicating something that exists in the environment, that there are three types of words, and that the basic errors in thinking come from use of one type of word as another type of word. First, there are "one" words which point to the world as a continuous affair. Second, there are "many" words which discriminate parts of the con- tinuous universe. Third, there are "relationship" words which indicate that the discriminated things are related. The whole of knowledge comes under the general form "The related many equals the one" and consists of discriminating aspects of the world and expressing the relations between the various aspects. Obviously, we never grasp the entire universe. Consequently we always use a "standard one" in place of the "one." It is just here that most of the errors of science and theology arise. If we are conscious that our finite knowledge is dealing with a selection and unification within an indefinite number of dynam- ically related things, and that for practical purposes we ignore for the time being the infinite regress of relations surrounding our object of knowledge, then our procedure is sound. But if we regard our standard one as an absolute one or universe, then we are talking nonsense. The assertion of absolute or</page><page sequence="2">324 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS exact electrons is an example of this error. A converse error is the use of our limiting concepts or "one" words as "many" words or discriminated aspects within the universe. Mr. Klyce applies this fundamental logic, and a fair store of supplemen- tary knowledge and analysis, to all branches of thought. Probably the worst fault of the book is the author's insistence that his formula, "the related many equals the one," is the key to the entire universe, as when he contends that value, life, religion, intoxication, love, are all examples of consciousness of the related many as equal to the one. There is much dogma and nonsense in the book but there is much keen thinking on important problems. Our reaction to some of his apparently foolhardy criticisms of scientists may be somewhat tempered by the discovery that in spite of a difference in vocabulary a large part of his philosophy of science seems to be in line with the trend of the doc- trines expressed by Whitehead in his Science and the Modern World. (Com- pare, for instance, Klyce's criticism of the exact or absolute electron with Whitehead's criticism of the conception of endurance as "undifferentiated sameness throughout the life-history concerned.") And if we are struck by absurdities in the book, we may be sure that Klyce's absurdities stand out the more for not being enunciated by the occupant of a recognized niche in the in- tellectual world and for not being the absurdities to which we are accustomed. C. M. PERRY THE SOCIAL THEORY OF GEORG SIMMEL. By Nicholas J. Spykman. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, I925. Pp. XVi+273. Deploring the bewildering confusion of methods at present prevailing in the field of sociology, Mr. Spykman proposes with this study on Simmel to reopen a methodological discussion. Essentially an expository essay on Sim- mel's social theory, the book is in no sense a critical study. As such the volume may not be without some value in conveying to a larger circle of students the thought of a German philosopher whose pre-eminent importance among social theories lies in the fact that he detected and demolished the remaining sur- vivals of mysticism and anthropomorphism which still attach to so much of contemporary study of society. Doubtless the most valuable portion of the volume is that which deals with Simmel's distinctions between sociology and the other social sciences. Simmel sought to erect a secure methodological basis for a science of sociology as distinct from social psychology, social philosophy, and the philosophy of history. He conceived of society, not as something con- crete, but as the sum of interactions between individuals. Social philosophy and the concept of historical law thrive in altitudes fit for metaphysical specu- lation, but they can never be considered under the head of scientific law. Not that Simmel would exclude the historical method entirely from social studies. He rather desired an alternate employment of the historical method and the method which aims at general timeless laws. The historical investigation, at least so far as sociology is concerned, is a means to the end of arriving at the discovery of a general correlation which is the aim of science. There is point to Simmel's argument that during the nineteenth century social studies were too exclusively dominated by the historical viewpoint to develop a science of sociology. With Simmel, sociology, breaking the chain of its dependence on the historical dimension, becomes a special and limited science whose task is the study of what Spykman in an unhappy phrase calls the "forms of socializa- tion," by which he means a social process, or a number of interacting processes. These "forms of socialization," says Simmel, are the legitimate province of the sociologist. W. L. DORN</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 325 NEW ASPECTS OF POLITICS. By Charles Edward Merriam. Chicago: The Uni- versity of Chicago Press, I925. Pp. Xvii+253. Professor Merriam presents in this small volume an unusually clear-eyed inventory of contemporary political science-its problems and its techniques for meeting them. Conceiving the objectives of politics as "the elimination of waste in political action" and "the release of political possibilities in human nature," the author combs psychology, statistics, biology, eugenics, and geog- raphy for insight and guidance. For the present, psychology and statistics seem to be most promising aids to politics; for the future, eugenics and critical education bulk large. He returns again and again to the incompatibility be, tween "jungle politics" and "laboratory science"; but while social guidance and control grow into a science, political prudence must be exploited to keep the already achieved control of nature out of the hands of medievalists. Canvassing agencies of research, outlining promising problems of the mo- ment, inviting co-operation from every quarter, Professor Merriam faces with reasoned optimism "a world of unceasing reorganization and adjustment." With education universalized, health bettered, leisure vastly increased, com- munication amazingly facilitated, eugenics advancing-the race imperatively needs men who know enough to govern it. Perhaps in no other volume avail- able today can one find so clear a recognition in all its bearing of the dangerous lag between natural science and political acumen, or so foresighted a survey of the scientific possibilities and promises of wholehearted devotion to social research. T. V. S. FREE NEGRO HEADS OF FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN i830. Pp. lvii+ 296. Price, $5.oo. FREE NEGRO OWNERS OF SLAVES IN THE UNITED STATES IN I830, TOGETHER WITH ABSENTEE OWNERSHIP OF SLAVES IN THE UNITED STATES IN i830. Pp. viii+78. Price, $i.oo. Both volumes by Carter Godwin Woodson. Washington: The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, I925 and 'I924 respectively. Both these volumes are statistical collections transcribed from the Census of i830. They contain the names of the heads of families, with the age of the head and the number in the family, by states and counties. The former re- veals something like a half-million free negroes in the United States in i830, this being about one-seventh of all the colored population. The latter reveals more than two thousand free negroes owning, usually though not always for philanthropic reasons, more than seven thousand slaves. Introductions to the statistical tables of each volume have, particularly for the first-mentioned vol- ume, valuable general analyses of the problem of the negro in America before the Civil War. T. V. S. THE TRAGEDY OF WASTE. By Stuart Chase. New York: The Macmillan Co., I925. Pp. 2Q6. Price, $2.50. Written from a sympathetic appreciation of industrialism, this volume nevertheless constitutes a veritable indictment of modern capitalism. Starting from the favorably criticized assumption that though the world-war withdrew into non-productive work one-fourth of American man-power, the standard of living for both productive and non-productive workers during the war at least held its own, the author goes on to analyze under the concept of waste the whole productive and distributive processes of our day. Of the two things that can be wasted-man-power and natural resources-he feels that through idle- ness, manufacture of vicious or useless things, and bad technical methods in</page><page sequence="4">326 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS production and distribution, perhaps half the man-power of America counts for nothing on this basis of analysis. And in spite of the conservation move- ment, Mr. Stuart finds that the waste per year in coal is 750 million tons, in oil a billion barrels, and in other natural resources to match. "by and large, the pioneer and his methods remain the masters of the nation's ever declining store of natural resources." That all such figures describing waste represent estimates is, of course, clear, but one who follows his growing interest through the colossal mass of statistical data here presented is likely to feel that the esti- mates are not wild. There have been already too many estimates from con- servative sources within industry itself for one to be able to go away unim- pressed by this staggering summary of the case. The appeal of the book is popular, the style is brisk, but the method is careful. Mr. Stuart conceives the conditions described not as some gloomy eventuation, but rather as such a challenge to the ethical and industrial conscience as will prevent just this eventuation. T. V. S. LABOR RELATIONS IN INDUSTRY By Dwight Lowell Hoopingarner. Chicago and New York: A. W. Shaw Company, 1925. Pp. xvi+553. Price, $4.00. Approaching the subject from the standpoint of "industry as a whole, of the state, and the relation of industry and the state to each other," our author proposes "to give a basis for developing a general point of view on labor relations," "to make an analysis of the major problems involved," "to indicate the major trend of development of policy and organization in the re- spective fields," and "to offer in each case constructive suggestions of a funda- mental nature for the handling of administrative problems arising out of these relations." Though written from this general point of view, the book will be of primary interest to those who are closely connected with the management of industry. There is, however, constant insistence upon the human equation in every phase of industrial activity. Indeed, the author goes so far as to say that "the most practical thing that industry needs today is an industrial phi- losophy that is human, and, being human, is most efficient." The book closes with the optimistic assurance "that after all capital and labor have an ultimate community of interest transcending any momentary differences and that to- gether, in one way or another, they very largely comprise the public whose rights are to be respected." T. V. S. THE RELIGION OF THE MANICHEES. By F. C. Burkitt. Cambridge: The Uni- versity Press, I925. Pp. I29. Price, 6s. net. In March, A.D. 242 a young man of twenty-six known as Mani, began to announce a new religion in Ctesiphon. He was executed when he was about sixty; but his religion had spread over the Roman world and for about one thousand years there was some doubt whether the Manichean religion would not dominate what we now know as Christianity in the East of Europe. Dr. Burkitt's small book is an illuminating statement of the history and character of this old religion. The religion had its martyrs, but persecution in this case succeeded and now there are no Manicheans. The value of the theories they held, however, is undoubted, especially for those interested in moral philoso- phy. Dr. Burkitt has given us the latest results of scholarship; for the recent discoveries of fragments in Asia have added considerably to our meager knowl- edge of the teaching of Mani. The book is indispensable for any student of religion or of the history of morality. The central theory is that the religion of Mani was, in fact, a version of Christianity at least in part, and not an anti- Christian movement.

With interest aroused by the Occident's denial of international right in the Great War, our oriental author sets out to study the international law that pre- vailed down to A.D. 500 between nations inside what we call India. After a pre- liminary justification of the assumption that there were national units in early India and a consideration of the sources of international law in India, our author proceeds to a detailed exposition of what the rules actually provided during both peace and war. The study appears to be thorough and careful. Many of the footnotes are in Sanskrit, and there is a bibliography at the end. T. V. S. FRENCH PHILOSOPHIES OF THE ROMANTIC PERIOD. By George Boas. Balti- more: The Johns Hopkins Press, I925. Pp. xi+325. Price, $2.50. The author here attempts "to study the philosophic background of one of the most interesting political and cultural periods in French history." He does not seek to criticize, but to describe; and he "has no moral purpose." The book is addressed "not only to students of philosophy but to students of civili- zation in general." The topics discussed are "the philosophical situations after the revolution," "the fortunes of ideology," "the neo-Christians," "the intro- duction of foreign thinkers," "the rise of eclecticism," and the "rise of posi- tivism." Though the print is fine, the page is pleasing, and the volume is an attractive example of what the numerous university presses in America are doing in the way of book-making. T. V. S. INTELLIGENCE IN EXPRESSION. By Leone Vivante., Translated by Professor Brodrick Bullock, with a Foreword by Professor H. Wildon Carr. Lon- don: C. W. Daniel &amp; Co. Pp. 205. Price, ios. 6d. net. This book, together with Sopra la originality del pensiero, gives the main thesis of Dr. Vivante, an idealist of the school of Croce. The former book con- tains, besides the translation of the author's earlier work, a translation of the first section in the second book named above. Vivante's thesis is that con- sciousness, by which he appears to mean all the activities usually classed as mental, is original; and actual thoughts are not caused by other thoughts or by material conditions. The meaning of the phraseology is explained by meta- phors drawn from the practice of the arts, chiefly poetry. Thus the most im- portant element in Vivante's philosophy is perhaps not the conclusion but the nature of the evidence on which he relies and his use of that evidence. Meta- physics has been so long dominated by science and scientific metaphors that perhaps a new outlook may be obtained by reference to the arts. Vivante fol- lows the idealist tradition in the use of the words "infinite" and "universal" and "concrete." There is very little reference to moral issues and moral ideals. C.D.B. AMERICA AND WORLD PEACE. By John H. Clarke. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., I925. Pp. vii+I45. Price, $i.5o. We have here by a former Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States a frank plea for an enlarged co-operation upon the part of America in the existing agencies for world peace. The book is composed of the Colver lec- tures, at Brown University, for last year. They deal with the general American interest in world peace, with the high importance -of the League of Nations as an agency to fulfil that interest, and with the Protocol for the Pacific Settle- ment of International Disputes as "a goal toward which all friends of world</page><page sequence="6">328 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS peace should strive." The lectures are frankly and earnestly apologetic for world peace and for the moral necessity of an enlarged American participation in all existing efforts toward it. The volume is very attractively bound. T. V. S. COMPARATIVE RELIGION AND THE RELIGION OF THE FUTURE. By Alfred W. Martin. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., I926. Pp. I2I. Price, $i.50. This small volume presents in very simple form what the author con- ceives to be the chief ideas in the great historical religions. An attempt is then made to indicate the ground common to all of them. What has been most com- mon, perhaps, is the belief of each that it possesses unique authority. The reli- gion of the future, entirely innocent of such an assumption regarding either itself or any other religion, will be free to inculcate the common ethical in- sights of all systems, religious and otherwise. Its doctrine of salvation will de- pend upon such grace as flows from the formula of Brunelleschi-"practice teaches what the next step to be taken shall be." What ought to be a truism to students of ethics, but is not, is here submitted to the popular reader. T.V. S. DETERMINISM IN EDUCATION. By William C. Bagley. Baltimore: Warwick &amp; York, Inc., I925. PP. I94. In this book the author brings together several papers previously pub- lished with certain papers of more recent investigations. It deals with the old problem of heredity vs. environment, as it relates to education, and is a pres- entation of Professor Bagley's side of the discussion which started with his paper on "Democracy and the I.Q.," read at the Chicago meeting of the Soci- ety of College Teachers of Education, in February, I922. The discussion pre- cipitated was vigorously carried on in the journals, chiefly with Professor Whipple and Professor Terman. The author is concerned with that sort of determinism which he feels is assumed by the advocates of intelligence tests when they attempt to classify public-school pupils as having different amounts of "native" intelligence, and because of this classification, submit them to a differentiated training. Such a view, Professor Bagley believes, asserts that a child is by nature determined in intellectual status and his life pursuit. Opposed to this view, he does not accept the "I.Q." as a fixed, unchangeable index. The individual is responsive to vari- ous "pressures" brought upon him by the social and the school environment, and his intelligence is the index of this response. He contends that by educa- tion the facility of this response may be increased, and as a consequence, the I.Q. changed. Good education, by which he means good teaching, of the peo- ple universally, will result in a "balancing up" of the inequalities of intelli- gence found among pupils and people at large. The only determinism he will admit is that due to physiological structure, but even these differences in "na- tive" intelligence, he believes, may be largely counteracted by systematic schooling. The author believes there exists a close correlation between the level of education attained through universal education of the people of a nation and the relative freedom of the nation from "war, revolution, demagogy, despotism, degeneration"; and, that the influence of mass-education on "moral" controls of conduct (if it be of the proper quality and of sufficient quantity and extent) will bring a like freedom from moral evils. There is nothing in the native en- dowment of the individual, so Professor Bagley contends, that will prevent the attainment'of democracy in all its forms of expression. The attainment is to be brought about by means of universal education, i.e., the provision of educa- tional opportunity equally for all the people. O. F. MYERS</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 329 THE CONSCIENCE OF THE NEWSPAPER. By Leon Nelson Flint. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., I925. Pp. x+470. Only in the broadest sense is this book on journalistic ethics. It is rather, as the author says, "an attempt to present American journalism as it is and as it seems destined to become if its finer possibilities are realized." The first part of the book deals with actual problems as they are presented to an editor. A generous selection of actual cases has been gathered through the co-opera- tion of American editors. The problem is briefly presented, the editor's deci- sion is given, and our author adds his comments upon the principle involved or upon the results of the decision. This section is highly concrete, and has an interest by no means confined to newspaper men and to students of ethics. The second part of the volume surveys journalism as it exists in America, sum- marizing the principles involved as they relate to the public. The third section is concerned with the trend-in journalism as revealed in the analysis of our present press. Assessment is made in successive chapters of the influence of codes and professional standards, of the influence of law, of professional train- ing, and of miscellaneous factors. An appendix contains all the codes in which associations of newspaper men have expressed the present standards for the conduct of the press. The case method is used wherever possible, and on prob- lems that do not land themselves to its use contrasting opinions are presented. In this way a balanced view is preserved upon problems that are too alive to be dogmatized upon. T.V.S. SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY: A Textbook for Students of Economics. By R. H. Thou- less, lecturer in psychology in the University of Manchester. London: The University Tutorial Press, I925. PP. 376. Price, 5s. 6d. This book is intended primarily as a textbook to be used for the examina- tions in London University for the B.Sc. (economics), and it is the very best kind of textbook, for it covers the ground and is very clearly and interestingly written. But it is more than a textbook. It is the sort of introduction to social psychology which will be most useful to the general public of readers and writers who ought to be acquainted nowadays with the recent extension of psy- chology in the study of social problems. The author gives a very good account of the generally accepted views of authorities. He is, of course, very much de- pendent upon McDougall's work. The theory of the instincts plays, as usual nowadays, the leading part in the analysis of social facts; but Mr. Thouless gives more weight than has recently been given to reason. The latter part of the book deals with morality, and this should be very useful to students of ethics; for our ethics tends to be still too greatly influenced by the obsolete terms and ideas of the Utilitarian period in psychology. Economic terminology also is criticized in part of Mr. Thouless' book, especially the terms connected with "diminishing returns." C.D.B. ETHICS IN THEORY AND APPLICATION. By Horatio W. Dresser. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co., I925. Pp. xviii+509. This book is a companion volume to the author's Psychology in Theory and Application. The reader's attention and interest are vigorously awakened by the opening words of the Preface in which the purpose of the work is ex- plained. "Moral issues, always subject to change and calling for fresh esti- mates, have passed through an unusual upheaval since the outbreak of the World War, and the moral situation has enlarged in scope." Psychology espe- cially and other recent practical tendencies have opened up new problems and</page><page sequence="8">330 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS new facts about human nature hitherto not understood, and these considera- tions challenge the attention of the ethicist. In short, ethics is on trial, and it can justify its fundamental place among the social sciences only by taking cog- nizance of these new facts and by grounding its theories in these facts instead of forcing them into ready-made abstractions. The book is addressed, more- over, to the general student of social problems, though it is primarily intended to serve the uses of college classes in ethics. When the reader turns to the author's actual method of procedure, he finds the book conventionally divided into three parts, the first dealing with the basis of ethics, the second with goodness and freedom, and the third with the moral life; the first two being concerned with moral principles and the last with applications. A serious effort is made, how successful is debatable, to con- struct an ethical idealism which will preserve as far as possible metaphysical and religious values while at the same time safeguarding the scientific and em- pirical office of ethics. Most exceptional is the manner in which this double- edged purpose is carried out. Into the compass of a single volume is brought a massive array of quotations from most of the standard ethical works. In the large amount of agreement among ethicists as to fundamental principles the author finds hope for the solution of our social problems and for the command- ing importance of ethics as a scientific technique. It is assumed, presumably, that general agreement as to principles assures the applicability of principles to fact. The eclectic comprehensiveness of the book, exhibiting an unusual com- mand of ethical literature, and the painstaking fairness, on the whole, in giving diverse views a hearing fall short of their purpose because of the oppressive and disjointed effect of the machinery on the thought. For the most part, the author steers a middle course apparently resolved to stress the importance of agreement on many fundamentals. The better course would be to hew to the line and let the chips fall where they may; the scientist is not concerned with the problem of agreement. In so far as the book follows a distinctive ethical principle, it argues the thesis of self-realization. Something ultimate and inner, not to be resolved into social relationships, is found. in personality. Palmer's ideal of the ethical organism is given promi- nence. In this belief in the ultimate character of the self the reader will find a means of reconciling the presence of a chapter on "Ultimate Values" in Part III (these values being regarded as religious values) and the occasional refer- ences to the "eternal values" with the oft-repeated insistence that ethics is logically independent of religion and is concerned with the changing values of the social order. Incidentally, the reviewer was surprised to find on page 491 the statement "It is significant that some of these writers are still trying to be hedonists, in the face of the long array of arguments against it." Equally in- credible in so recent a book is the statement on page 490 that the student of ethics "probably will not be satisfied with mere pragmatism, namely, the no- tion that an ethical conception suffices if it 'works' in application to this life as just now presented."

Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co., I925. PP. xii+393. This volume appears in the "Lippincott Sociological Series," edited by Edward Cary Hayes. It presents a view of the immigration problem at pres- ent from the points of view of the chief immigrant-receiving countries. Specif- ically it considers the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Brazil, and Argentine Republic. In appendixes are presented complete texts of the United States immigration acts since I9I7, -together with naturali- zation laws and regulations. T. V. S. SPECULATIONS (Essays on Humanism and the Philosophy of Art.) By T. E. Hulme. New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., I924. Pp. XVi+267. Hulme objects to the humanist attitude which has prevailed since the Renaissance. It postulates life as the source and measure of all values, and re- gards man as fundamentally good. He thinks the religious attitude is the right one, that man is radically imperfect, able to apprehend perfection, but not to incorporate it in himself. Perfection belongs to the plane of the non-human; human relations are blurred when perfection is introduced among them, and the real nature of ethical values is distorted by deriving them out of essentially subjective things like human desires and feelings. Humanism is an anthro- pomorphization of the world leading to an art founded on the pleasure to be drawn from vital forms. Since classical and modem art both have this basis we have looked upon them as art, regarding the arts of other periods as archae- ology or ethnology. Hulme thinks it significant that we are just lately coming to understand these other arts, and asks if the change of sensibility in a region like aesthetics, a bypath in which we are, as it were, off our guard, may not be some indication that the humanist tradition is breaking up. Whereas our art has been based on "a happy pantheistic relation between man and the outside world," "the dead form of a pyramid and the suppression of life in a Byzantine mosaic show that behind these arts there must have been an impulse, the direct opposite of that which finds satisfaction in the naturalism of Greek and Re- naissance art." It is the tendency to abstraction, based on the feeling of dis- harmony between man and nature, resulting in the creation of "a certain ab- stract geometrical shape, which, being durable and permanent shall be a 'refuge from the flux and impermanence of nature ... . In the reproduction of nat- ural objects there is an attempt to purify them of their characteristically living qualities in order to make them necessary and immovable;" Hulme is finally confirmed in his theory that the humanist tradition is breaking up by his ob- servation in modern art of this tendency away from delight in vital forms toward the abstract and geometrical. The book is compiled from the papers which Hulme left behind him. There is a good essay on Bergson's theory of art. And there are the delightful notes for a personal philosophy in allegorical form, the essence of which is that the world has no unity. He says: "I shall call my philosophy the 'Valet to the Absolute.' The Absolute not a hero to his own valet." V. M. AMES</page></plain_text>
