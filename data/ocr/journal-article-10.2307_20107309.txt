<plain_text><page sequence="1">Erin McGlothlin No Time Like the Present: Narrative and Time in Art Spiegelman's Maus TURNING INTO THE PAST Midway through the second volume of Art Spiegelman's comic novel Maus: A Survivor's Tale, Vladek, the Holocaust survivor, during a walk through a Catskills resort, explains to his son the procedure for Selektionen at Auschwitz, the terrifying periodic physical evaluations in which prisoners were sorted according to those who seemed capable of further performing slave labor and those who were too weak and therefore condemned to be murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau (Fig. 1). "In the whole camp was selektions," Vladek begins in the first panel of a four-panel block. "I went two times in front of Dr. Mengele." In the next panel, he continues to narrate his experience in the selections: "We stood without anything, straight like a soldier. He glanced and said: FACE LEFT!" At the same time, Vladek is shown abruptly turning a quarter turn in the image that accompanies this narration; in effect, he is performing his role in the selection for his son, Artie, who stands aside to the left of the panel and watches the re-created spectacle, all the while recording Vladek's narration with a tape recorder that hangs from his shoulder. In the third panel of the sequence, Vladek continues to narrate his experience in the selections, quoting Mengele's order again to "FACE LEFT!" At the same time, he enacts the prisoner's compliance with the order, performing another obedient quarter turn. In the fourth panel, Vladek's explanation continues in a narrative box above the panel ("They looked to see if eating no food made you too skinny"), but here the survivor's reenactment of the selection during a walk through the country is replaced by a de piction of the original scene of the selection. Vladek is now no longer the aged narrator of a past experience, but the naked, emaciated prisoner who is first experi Erin McGlothlin is Assistant Professor of German at Washington University in St. Louis.

He performs again a quarter turn, but in this panel it is not Artie who observes and records Vladek's story. Rather, a German camp official (according to Vladek's narration, Josef Mengele), a predatory cat to Vladek's hunted mouse, stands to the left and orders him to "FACE LEFT!" and at the same time records his evaluation of Vladek's physical condition on a clipboard. This last panel effects a visual break in the block of panels, for it suddenly transports the reader from a visual depiction of a present site of verbal narration of the past to a visual depiction of the narrated moment of the past itself. The visual seems to signify the abrupt chasm between past and present (a young, emaciated Vladek versus an aged, well-dressed Vladek), while Vladek's telling of the story appears to hold the two events together, linking the past and present in the process of narration. The comic book format of the scene, with its easily differentiated depictions of two separate tem poral levels and two physical manifestations of the same character (young versus old), appears to clarify the disparities between the past and the present and to divide the two temporalities into distinct units in a much more visceral way than narration. For a novel about both the Holocaust past of the survivor and his present-day relationship with his son, Maus's use of visual images as a supplement to narration seems to be an ideal method for demarcating the differences between Holocaust experience and the contemporary lives of the survivor and his son. A second look at this sequence of panels, however, belies this easy assumption about the use of visual media to distinguish past and present. The comic images of Maus, rather than clearly marking off the past from the present, contribute to a prob lem in which the present and the past are intimately interconnected and difficult to separate from one another, for the past is revealed as constitutive of the present, and the present makes demands on the ways in which the past is represented. The fourth panel of the block, which at first appears to be cut off from the rest, functions as an</page><page sequence="3">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman 's Maus 179 extension of the other three panels, as a constituent of a visual and verbal story. This link between the images and the development of the story from the present to the past is evident in the mise-en-sc?ne of the last panel, which echoes the previous two panels in its structure. Here, as in the panels of Vladek's reenactment, we see a rotat ing Vladek on the right side of the panel who "performs" in front of an observer standing on the left. The observer in the last panel, Mengele, mirrors Artie's posture in the previous panels almost exactly, and, just as Mengele determines and records Vladek's future "fate" (to be sent to the "good side" and not "to the other side," a destiny visually represented by a chimney [58]), Artie watches and records Vladek's story of the selection. This is not to say that the visual text encourages the reader to compare or conflate the person of Josef Mengele, a mass murderer, with Artie, the audience for Vladek's story, but it does establish a visual analogue between the rep resentation of an original scene of victimization and trauma and the retelling of the event, insisting that the two are not distinct, mutually exclusive processes. The con tinuity between the retelling of the scene and the depiction of it is further under scored by the image of Vladek's rotation, for between the second and the last panels, he progressively rotates three-quarters of a circle to the left. Just as in a moving film, which is made up of numerous still pictures that, when projected in rapid succession, contribute to a sense of seamless movement, so too the three panels evoke the idea of continuous, unbroken turning, apart from the abrupt rupture in setting and despite the fact that they are distinct images.1 Vladek's gesture of turning and the visual rep resentation of its continuation from the present to the past reveal the intricate rela tionship between the two temporal planes, performing visually the narrative process by which Vladek "returns" to his Holocaust past. As the relationship between the text and image in this instance indicates, however, it is not so much the past that af fects the present by means of a story intruding into the present moment of story telling. Rather, the present, the site of Vladek's verbal narration, is superimposed upon the representation of the past, as embodied in the comic image, and the past story that is narrated bears the visual traces of the act of storytelling. The present, both visually and metaphorically, thus "turns" into the past. THE TEMPORAL CONTINUUM The representation of Vladek reenacting the Selektion in Auschwitz is one of many scenes in both Maus I and Maus II in which the Holocaust past is an integral element of the present and the present becomes key for representing this past. In deed, even though Spiegelman's comic project appears to contain two separate, seemingly unconnected narrative strands that strictly delineate the then of the fa ther's Holocaust story and the now of the narration of that story, the text evades any attempt on the part of the reader to keep these two chronological levels distinct from one another. This effect of temporal blurring, of the implication of the past in the pre sent and vice versa, has been remarked upon by a number of critics. According to James Young, "In Maus, not only are past and present linked, but they constantly in trude and occasionally even collapse into each other" (682). Dominick LaCapra</page><page sequence="4">180 Erin McGlothlin holds a similar view: "the past not only interacts with, but erupts into, the present, and at times the present seems to be only a function of, or a diaphanous screen for, the past" (155). For Keith Harrison, by the end of the book, "two places, two times, and two narrative lines movingly converge" (67). A number of critics, however, take issue with the notion of temporal collapse in Maus and insist that the then and now in Spiegelman's text, though narratively intertwined and implicated in one another, cannot be normalized into an unbroken continuum in which the past flows evenly and smoothly into a present. Rather, the text, by utilizing certain narrative devices, resists any sort of chronological equilibrium. According to Marianne Hirsch, Maus disrupts its own narrative and visual temporal flow by incorporating three actual photographs of the Spiegelman family, severing what she terms the "testimonial chain" that links past and present (26). For Alan Rosen, the disruption takes place not visually, through photographs, but rather aurally, through Vladek's broken Eng lish: "Although it is but the inflection of an individual voice, Vladek's accent also shapes the aesthetic structure of Maus, providing Spiegelman with the means to rep resent, and distinguish, present and past. ... for episodes in the past, Spiegelman uses fluent, colloquial English to represent the languages of Europe as spoken by their native speakers; for episodes in the present, Vladek's broken, accented English serves as a constant marker. . . . within the terms Maus establishes, Vladek's broken English becomes the means by which Spiegelman articulates the incommensurabil ity between present and past" (257-58). For Hirsch and Rosen, the distance between past and present is unbridgeable, despite the easy temporal blurring that appears to take place through the process of reading the comic frames. Critics have highlighted a further complication in the relationship between tem poral levels in Maus by pointing out that the text contains not only two narrative strands?the narratological categories of story and discourse?but actually three. In addition to Vladek's Holocaust experience and his narration ofthat experience to Artie, the text contains a third layer that consists of Art's reflections on witnessing his father's story and on the problems of shaping it into a visual narrative.2 According to James Young, this third layer highlights not only Vladek's story itself, but the ways in which the retelling of it becomes itself an integral component of the narrative process: By weaving back into his narrative the constant reflection on his own role in ex tracting this story from his father, Spiegelman graphically highlights not only the ways that testimony is an event in its own right but also the central role he plays in this event. . . . That is, what is generated in the interaction between fa ther and son in this case is not a revelation of a story already existing, waiting to be told, but a new story unique to their experience together. This medium allows the artist to show not only the creation of his father's story but the necessary grounds for its creation, the ways his father's story hinges on his relationship to the listener. ... In this way, Spiegelman is both midwife to and eventual repr? senter of his father's story. (676-78) For Young, the third layer reflects on the situation in which Artie, the listening char acter, finds himself. In this layer, he emerges not as the passive receiver of a story of</page><page sequence="5">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman 's Maus 181 trauma and loss, but as the witness who effectively becomes the co-producer of that story. Stephen Tabachnick, on the other hand, concentrates not on the scene of testi mony and the role of witnessing, but on Art's struggle to imagine Vladek's story and to find a viable aesthetic form through which he can tell it. Tabachnick orders the three narrative strands according to the generic conventions to which they corre spond. The first diegetic layer, Vladek's story of his survival in the ghetto, in hiding and in Auschwitz, becomes an epic narrative, "a monstrous Odyssey" (156). The middle layer, which focuses on Artie's relationship to his parents and the effects of their Holocaust experience on his own life, corresponds to the Bildungsroman. Fi nally, the third layer, the K?nstlerroman, narrates the problem of Maus's production, focusing on Spiegelman's concerns about the problems of representation, authentic ity, and imagining an event that he never experienced. My reading of the three layers of temporality combines elements of Young's perspective on the role of witnessing with Tabachnick's ordering of the diegetic lev els according to genre and aligns them with G?rard Genette's system of classifying narrative in a tripartite schema of story, discourse, and narrating.3 The first, inner most diegetic level4 of Maus contains the narrative's story, Genette's term for "the signified or narrative content" of a narrative (27): Vladek's life in prewar Poland, his experience of the German invasion as both soldier and civilian, his attempts to elude capture and deportation, his incarceration in Auschwitz, and his liberation. The sec ond, or middle, narrative level is comprised of the scene of this narration?the times when Artie visits Vladek to listen to and record the first story?which, according to Genette's typology, is the location of the narrative's discourse. In addition, the sec ond level is the arena of an additional story?the often difficult relationship between Artie and Vladek. On this narrative level, which locates the scene of testimony and witnessing, Artie, Vladek, Mala, and Fran?oise are portrayed as mice and are thus depicted according to the same representational logic as the first diegetic level, which casts the characters as various anthropomorphic animal species functioning within the animal kingdom's web of power relations.5 The visual differences be tween the first two levels are not distinctions of character representation (the charac ters are animals in both levels), but ones of the setting in which the characters function (Queens, the Catskills, and Florida of the present versus Poland during the Holocaust). The exception is of course the representation of Vladek, which is per haps the most striking indicator of the respective narrative levels. On the one level, he is shown as young and physically virile, although the dapper ladies' man at the be ginning of the story slowly transforms into the thin, starving slave laborer at the end. But the depiction of a young Vladek clearly differs from that of the middle narrative, which shows him as an old man, wrinkled, stooped, and in poor health, a survivor who visually embodies the cost of survival. By glancing at the Vladek of each frame, the reader can thus immediately orient herself with regard to the narrative level. Of course, as we saw with the image of Vladek rotating, the visual difference between the inner and middle narrative levels is not always distinct. Vladek's voice penetrates into the visual representations of his Holocaust story, and he quotes his di rect speech from the past in panels that refer to the middle narrative, the site of the narration of that story. Furthermore, the text contains dozens of instances in which</page><page sequence="6">182 Erin McGlothlin the two narrative levels exist in close proximity to one another or even within the same panel. As with the scene of Vladek's selection, the text places very similar im ages from both narrative levels side by side, as in an exemplary scene of Anja's dis tress in Maus I, when Vladek the narrator echoes a hatted Vladek from the first diegetic level (Fig. 2). In this example, the blurring of narrative levels takes place not only visually, with the second level's repetition of the first level's mise-en-sc?ne, but on the verbal level as well, with the narrator's assumption of the character's dia logue, without quotation or indirect discourse. This instance of the juxtaposition of Vladek the character with Vladek the narrator is but one of many in the two volumes of Maus, for the first and second narrative levels (the separate sites of story and dis course) consistently alternate and are interwoven with one another throughout the text. G?rard Genette terms these juxtapositions narrative metalepses, which are transgressions that "by the intensity of their effects, demonstrate the importance of the boundary they tax their ingenuity to overstep, in defiance of verisimilitude?a boundary that is precisely the narrating (or the performance) itself: a shifting but sa cred frontier between two worlds, the world which one tells, the world of which one tells" (236). The boundary between the two narrative levels, the level of Vladek's Holocaust story and the level of Artie's witnessing, is thus both blurred and high lighted by the abundant visual metalepses that occur throughout the text. The third, outer level of Maus, which functions as an instance of the third part of Genette's system, that of narrating, grapples with the connections between the other two layers (the testimonial relationship); Art's problems of imagining, repro ducing, and representing Vladek's testimony; and, beginning in the second volume, the role of reception of the first volume of the comic novel. This narrative level oper ates as a metadialogue about the other two narrative levels, for just as the middle level is a metareflection on Vladek's Holocaust story, so too this third level of narrat ing examines both the original site of trauma and the traces of this trauma in the wit nessing relationship. In addition, this layer investigates Art's struggle with imagining and representing his father's story. Despite the book's apparently easy depictions of Fig. 2.

Art must imagine it to be able to draw it, and his fear of not living up to the task points to the text's fragile claim to representational authenticity and even to its potential unauthenticity. This narrative level thus encour ages the reader to consider the inability on the part of both Art, and by extension, the text, to decisively or realistically "capture" Vladek's experience and represent it in a narrative. The third diegetic level of narrating is marked off visually from the other levels in two ways. The first is the use of lower-case lettering, which appears briefly in the first volume and more often in the second and marks a stark contrast to the upper case text that dominates the rest of the book. However, although the third level is limited in its use, it is the narrative mode in which the entire Maus project originates. The first panel of Maus I begins the narrative with a lower-case introduction to the narrative's impetus: "It was summer, I remember. I was ten or eleven. ... I was roller-skating with Howie and Steve . . ." (5). The use of the lower-case, like that of the upper-case of the first and second diegetic levels, functions here to mark a site of narrating. In this case, however, it is Art who is doing the narrating, not Vladek, who controls the narration in the middle level. Although the dominant story that emerges in the text belong to Vladek, the first story of the text and the first instance of narrat ing belong to Art. Art, like Vladek, has his own story to tell, and, as with Vladek's narration, the narrated event, Art's own story of himself as the second-generation witness, unfolds in upper-case dialogue. In the first volume of Maus, however, the use of lower-case lettering is limited and sporadic, appearing as brief introductions to some of the chapters and serving as a prologue to the respective narrative situa tion. The third diegetic level is thus barely discernable in the first volume. In the sec ond volume, the lower-case is used more often, especially at the beginning of the second chapter, "Auschwitz (time flies)," where it is sustained for several pages. In this section, the second marker of the level of narrating appears with the depiction of the characters as humans wearing animal masks, rather than embodying anthropo morphic characters.6 The employment of the mouse mask over the human head points to the text's self-conscious reflection on its own production, on the represen tational choices it has made from a spectrum of aesthetic possibilities. Spiegelman's choice of casting his father's narrative as an animal tale, as a fabulous story in which mice are hunted by cats who are in turn hunted by dogs, while pigs selfishly protect their own interests, is thus exposed as an arbitrary (and potentially dangerous) method of framing a story.7 Rather than allowing the reader to immerse herself com fortably in the mouse-and-cat universe, Art's wearing of the mask, which from the front looks authentic and only from the side and back is revealed as a mask with strings that attach it to a human head,8 ejects the reader from the complacency of the animal metaphor and points to both its artifice and its effectiveness as a normalized aesthetic device. In addition, Art's role as the author of the Artie and Vladek narra tives is made explicit here (he's shown at the drawing table listening to tapes of his father and himself), but the wearing of the mask, which places Art both inside and outside of the representational framework that governs the rest of Maus, prevents him from assuming a quasi-transcendent, autonomous authorial identity. Art is thus</page><page sequence="8">184 Erin McGlothlin depicted as a character in much the same way as Vladek and Artie, and he too strug gles with the same overwhelming forces of history and memory. But his relationship to the past takes on an additional dimension, for he must contend with both his own problems of imagining and shaping his father's story and the reception of the prod uct of his imagination. The third diegetic level of Maus, which Richard Martin terms "metafictional" (380), Jeanne C. Ewert "metatextual" (93), and Rick Iadonisi a "meta-meta-narrative" (45), thus functions as the outer narrative of the text, the in stance of narrating that reflects on the stories of the other two levels. Unlike the first, inner narrative, which is directly concerned with Vladek's story of the Holocaust, the outer narrative struggles with the problems of imagining that experience and trans forming it into a visual narrative. The two narrative activities are not directly op posed to one another, but rather they function as the diegetic boundaries that delimit the text. The three narrative levels can be viewed as forming a sort of continuum, by which the inner narrative (story) gradually makes its way through the medium of witnessing (discourse) to the outer narrative (narrating). Such a continuum might be imagined as follows, moving from left to right: First (inner) narrative Second (middle) narrative Third (outer) narrative (story) (discourse) (narrating) Vladek's Holocaust experience scene of Vladek's testimony memory and representation (epic narrative) (Bildungsroman) (K?nstlerroman) In Maus, the movement between diegetic levels occurs with the absorption of the father's trauma into the son's memory through the very agency of narrative, the act of storytelling. THE SUPER-PRESENT If there are indeed three diegetic strands in Maus, then how do they line up with the two temporal levels discussed previously, i.e., past and present? According to G?rard Genette, a narrative level is distinguished from other levels not only by the scene and the agent of narration (who tells what story), but, more importantly, by the time of the narrated story.9 Each narrative possesses its own temporality, even if the narrative time overlaps with that of other diegetic levels. The temporal dimensions of Vladek's story, the innermost narrative, are relatively easy to identify: the tale that he narrates to Artie is located in the distant past, in the time prior to the German inva sion of Poland and in the years that followed, up until shortly after the end of the Second World War. (Easy despite Vladek's own problematic experience of ordering a seemingly fractured and unstable sense of temporality during the Holocaust, which then has consequences for his subsequent memory of time. As he says, "In Auschwitz we didn't wear watches" [// 68]). The problem of designating narrative time gets tricky, however, when one looks at the other pole of the past-present tem poral continuum. To which narrative strand is the reader to assign the temporal des ignation of the present? It seems that the present of which Young, Hirsch, LaCapra, Rosen, and Harrison speak could refer to either the levels of discourse or narrating.</page><page sequence="9">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman's Maus 185 The concept of the present seems inadequate for the discussion of the two outermost narrative levels. Of course, one could argue that the level of discourse precedes the level of narrating chronologically, and therefore belongs to a completely different temporality. But the temporal problems to which Young, LaCapra, and others refer? namely the conflation of Vladek's Holocaust past with the postwar, more contempo rary scenes of which Art/Artie are a part?seem to reduce the text conceptually to a chronological dichotomy of before/during and after. The text thus refers to the di alectic between an event and its aftermath. The narrative levels in which Art/Artie participate are permanently severed from the Holocaust past and can only access this past through storytelling and imagination. In this way, they necessarily belong to the present, to the time of after. As we have seen, however, these outermost narrative levels are separate in terms of their diegetic function: just as the middle narrative re flects on Vladek's telling of the first narrative, so too the outermost narrative con templates both the middle and the first narratives. Tabachnick separates the two narratives of the present into the genres of K?nstlerroman and Bildungsroman, but how are we to designate their respective temporalities? Spiegelman himself distin guishes between the present of Vladek's storytelling and the present of Art's reflec tions on the book by employing the terms present and super-present: This section was kind of not one I planned on doing, obviously, when I was planning the book. But it was the only way I could move forward to make the obstacles manifest. So I had to do this thing that now had a different layer of present than anything that happened before. There was a present with Vladek and me talking and then there was the past with his story. All of the sudden we now had a kind of super-present. And the super-present is done with certain de vices?for one thing, the upper- and lower-case writing, which is used only a few times earlier in the book. It's used when you very first enter into the story and in a couple of captions, like "I went back to visit my father," or something like that. And that implies that all of that upper- and lower-case comes from a different present. The other indicator is that we're moving closer to a present where there are people. So that these masks are more obviously masks than ever before. The masks are masks of mice on what's obviously humans wearing them. But I needed some device to allow myself access to this particular anec dote, which was necessary for me to just kind of get it out of the way and get back to business. {Complete Maus 178) Spiegelman divides the contemporary temporality of his book into two layers of time that are distinct but at the same time refer to generally the same time period. The pre sent, according to this classification, refers to the time that both narrates and is nar rated; it is the time period in which Vladek tells his story to Artie and the time in which their respective lives unfold and move on (Vladek's worsening health and his separation from Mala, Artie's developing book project). Besides containing Vladek's narration of the Holocaust past, this is the temporal space in which the everyday takes place, in which life is lived. The temporality in this level of discourse is fluid and contains movement and development. The super-present, on the other hand, is</page><page sequence="10">186 Erin McGlothlin not a category of everyday life, a fluid, developing temporality that is narrated as a series of events. Rather, it seems to occupy a place outside the movement of life, in a static space that is not the antithesis of life, but a place where life's ebb and flow do not reach. The prefix super-, which designates something that is "above, beyond, or over in place or time or conceptually," "to a great or extreme desgree," and "of a higher kind" (Oxford Dictionary 1532), indicates that this super-present is not the present that is usually experienced, but a place apart from the temporal logic of the rest of the book, one that occupies a metaposition with regard to the conventional temporal flow of the present; in short, a sort of timelessness. This is the temporal space that Spiegelman establishes in the level of narrating in order to reflect on his project, a narrative time in which nothing exactly happens,10 but in which the com plexities and contradictions that relate to the other narrative levels are exposed. TIME FLIES As Spiegelman explains, the part of the book in which the super-present of nar rating is revealed, apart from a few brief examples in Maus I, is the chapter "Auschwitz (time flies)" in Maus II. This chapter occurs well into the second vol ume, after the "Mauschwitz" chapter, which depicts both Vladek's arrival and first months at Auschwitz and Artie's stay with Vladek in the Catskills. The second vol ume of Maus thus begins in much the same way as the first, with Chapter One con tinuing the previously established narrative mode, alternating between the first and second narrative levels. Chapter Two, however, marks a break in this narrative conti nuity, one that can be perceived immediately in its title. To begin with, the title "Auschwitz (time flies)" echoes "Mauschwitz," but at the same time the text corrects and displaces the previous title for the reader, arresting any easy immersion into the text's coy and Disneyesque construction of the animal cartoon. Indeed, the correct historical German name of the camp following so closely behind the kitschy, revi sionist name (perhaps the name of a Holocaust amusement park?)11 signals a ques tioning of the representational logic that has operated heretofore. With the title "Mauschwitz," the text pushes to its breaking point the trope of the cartoon animal and its tendency to erase difference in the pursuit of metaphorical conformity, to the point at which it threatens to displace history and transform it into a commodity of mass culture and cartoon kitsch. The reassertion of and reinsistence on the name Auschwitz both broaches the problem of representation (reminding the reader of Adorno's much-debated and oft-misquoted dictum on poetry after Auschwitz) and guides the reader back from the realm of the ever more totalizing tendency of the metaphor to an actual historical space in which the Holocaust took place. At the same time, the second part of the title, "time flies," raises the specter of temporality, alluding both to a time that refuses to stand still and thus transports us ever further and more quickly from the historical event of Auschwitz, and, by ironically referring to the verbal phrase "time flies when you're having fun," to the problem of ordering the experience of time in Auschwitz into a normalized chronology.</page><page sequence="11">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman 's Maus 187 It is not only the chapter title, however, that makes a break with the previous narrative mode, but the graphic that accompanies it on the title page as well. This image, as opposed to all of the other title pages in Maus, is not contained in the cir cumscribed frame. Rather, there are little flies (yet another species of animal in Spiegelman's animal fable) scattered around the frame that appear as if they are climbing out of the image within the frame. The contained image, one of the most vi olent and disturbing of all of the images in Maus, depicts anthropomorphic mice consumed alive by flames, screaming and moaning in agony. As the reader later learns, the image refers to and is repeated with the story Vladek hears from one of the workers in the Auschwitz Sonderkommando, who personally witnessed the burn ing of live people in mass graves (// 72). This image thus viscerally refers to the first part of the title, "Auschwitz." The second part of the title, "(time flies)," the after thought contained in parentheses, refers to the images not contained in the frame, the flies. The flies seem to emerge from this stark and disquieting image into the noncir cumscribed space of the text, from the Auschwitz past contained in the frame into the present in which this past is embedded. They are time flies (the substantive phrase rather than the verbal phrase), buzzing reminders of time passed and a past time that carry the trace of the past into the present. Thus, with the trope of the fly, time itself becomes, in a sense, a character in Spiegelman's book. The chapter opens on the next page with a brief prologue (written in lower case) and a row of two panels depicting Art bent over his drawing desk (Fig. 3). As previously noted, in this section Art wears a mouse mask that is tied around his human head. The flies that appear on the title page surface here as well and buzz an noy ingly around him. Art is lit in a stark manner; he's flooded in a bright light that seems to move around somewhat (in the first panel his chair is in the black shadow; in the second, it's included in the light). This view of Art working while the flies buzz around his head continues in the next row of panels, which, combined with the first row, simulates the movement of a camera zooming out. In the last panel of the page, which in size equals the previous four panels and takes up half the page, the "camera lens" zooms out even further and the reader gets a full view of Art, hunched over his drawing table. The reader suddenly understands why the flies were buzzing around in the previous panels, for Art's table rests upon a mound of naked mouse corpses. The presence of the flies around the anthropomorphic animal corpses takes Spiegel man's animal metaphor a step further; flies are found around both filth and vermin and death and decay. The reader is thus reminded of the short distance from the de piction of Jews as vermin to the specious justification for their destruction, for this metaphorical journey is made through the trope of the fly. Through the window to the right of the panel, one glimpses a watchtower ringed with a barbed-wire fence. A possible source for the stark lighting in the first panels is also suggested in this panel, for it could be the watchtower's searchlight that is producing the moving panes of bright light.12 Graphically, the different temporal planes of the Holocaust past and the present of Art's life coexist in the same image. On the one hand, Art's artistic pro duction thus shares the same space as the Holocaust victims, and, because his draw ing table is mounted directly upon (or perhaps even rises out of) their bodies, his</page><page sequence="12">188 Erin McGlothlin Time fue* . . .m Ml*4ek ?fatei working a, tmmfcn m fc*$ct\witz. in ^W*f&gt;rin? of 19ft... &amp;&amp;rte4 ^or^5S ?ftit?? p*?* &amp; In *A?4W?

From MAUS II: A SURVIVOR'S TALE/AND HERE MY TROUBLES BEGAN by Art Spiegelman, copyright 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991 by Art Spiegelman. Used by permission of Pantheon Books, a division of Random House, Inc.</page><page sequence="13">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman 's Maus 189 artistic production is thus, to a certain extent, based on their suffering and death. His aesthetic project and its commercial success are predicated on the trauma, loss, and destruction of others, and this figures him as a co-perpetrator, one who is able to con stitute himself by annihilating others. In a sense, by telling his father's story, he re produces the death of the victims at the same time; he revives them only to have them murdered once more, with him in the director's chair, staging the spectacle.13 On the other hand, Art is also fashioned here as a victim, for in this mise-en-sc?ne with the barbed wire and watchtower, he becomes the inmate of a concentration camp. The watchtower's searchlight focuses on him, singling him out as both a po tential "criminal" and a victim. Art thus experiences the scene of the Holocaust past; it becomes the surroundings in which he both lives and works. The first indicators of the presence of this past are the time flies in the first panels, which function as the disturbing residues of a past that, like a pesky insect, will not go away. Accompanying the graphic elements of the first page of this chapter are several portions of text. Indeed, before the visual panels commence, a short two-word pro logue, "Time flies .. .," like Art's introductions to the chapters in Maus I, begins the chapter. However, the phrase in this particular context, in the static temporality of Spiegelman's super-present, is employed ironically: time in this narrative mode does not fly, does not develop and unfold, but rather seems to stand still. This reference to a temporality that is stuck and unhinged from the conventional movement of life res onates in Art's narration, which he assumes in the first panel. In each panel, he lists different events that have happened in his and his father's lives along with the re spective time frames in which they occurred. The events are grouped in a seemingly arbitrary manner, alternating episodes from Vladek's past (in random order) with moments in Art's life (in likewise random order). Indeed, the chain of time created by the juxtaposition of events seems at first to follow no chronological principle: the text moves from August 1982 to August 1979 to spring 1944 to February 1987 to May 1987 to May 1944 to September 1986 to May 1968 to the present ("lately"). There is an arbitrary logic to this chronology, however, for it seems that Art is com paring a past event that happened during a certain time of year ("May" or "spring") to a present event that happened in the same season. With regard to chronology, the principle of comparison seems to operate here: by situating the events of the Holo caust within a time frame recognizable to both Art and the reader, he pulls his fa ther's experience out of a mythological, achronological, and ahistorical past and places it alongside the more commonplace, "real" events of the present. The reader is thus reminded that the story that she has been reading is not "really" a fictive animal fable but a narrated experience that comes from the same order of "reality" as the present time of Art's drawing table. At the same time, however, the events, though seemingly arbitrarily arranged, are carefully juxtaposed to evoke the enormous im pact of the past on the present and the radical difference between Vladek's Holocaust past and Art's present. In the first panel, Vladek's death in August is paired with Art and Fran?oise's visit with him in the Catskills in August, highlighting the chasm between their exasperating experiences with a living Vladek and the finality of his death. This juxtaposition of life and death reveals both Art's sense of loss and his remorse over his troubled relationship with his father. The second panel compares</page><page sequence="14">190 Erin McGlothlin their respective working experiences and at the same time marks the radical differ ence in the definition of "work" in each case; for Art, work (work on the present page of text, work on the present) means both creative self-expression and the process of mourning (Trauerarbeit), while for Vladek, work is slave labor, an exhausting, de bilitating form of exploitation that must be performed at all costs if one is to survive. The third panel again juxtaposes life with death; in this case, the upcoming birth of Art and Fran?oise's daughter is evoked in the same breath as the murder of over one hundred thousand Hungarian Jews in the brief time period of eight days. The happi ness and excitement of a new Jewish life is thus tainted and sobered by the memory of so many Jewish lives annihilated, a number of deaths that can hardly be imagined and that stands in stark contrast to the birth of one child. Once again, the past casts a pall over the present, while the "time flies" buzz around. In the fourth panel, Art raises the issue of his present project, of his commercial and critical achievement with the publishing of Maus. He continues to speak of Maus's celebrity in the fifth panel, detailing the markers of authorial success and at the same time his own resis tance to his newfound fame and the commercialization of his book ("I don't wanna"). As in the previous panels, death and the past make themselves known here as well with the mention of Art's mother's suicide. Art's success, which, like his drawing table, is based on the suffering and death of countless masses of people, is thus juxtaposed with Anja's lack of success, with her personal failure to "survive" and to make sense of and move beyond the trauma of the Holocaust. Art has outdone his own mother. He has survived her, and his ability to create a written document of himself and his father stands in contrast to Anja's unwritten legacy, pointing to the absence of a suicide note, and by extension, to Vladek's survival of her with his de struction of her diaries. At the same time, however, Art accuses his mother of not communicating her reasons for killing herself; his parenthetical aside ("(She left no note.)") mirrors the petulant, self-pitying response to his commercial success in parenthesis in the previ ous line ("(I don't wanna.)"). In this large last panel of the page, in which the focus opens up to portray Art hunched in despair on his artist's throne that rests upon a mass of unidentifiable corpses, the seemingly arbitrary listing of events and their re spective time frames culminates in his final statement of despair, "Lately I've been feeling depressed." Following as it does his mention of his mother's suicide, this de claration invites comparison between Art's depression and Anja's own desperation, suggesting that the problems that befell the mother also fall upon the child (witness Art's depression as depicted in the "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" narrative in Maus I). At the same time, the reader is reminded of Anja's history of trauma as an explana tion for her suicide (not to mention her propensity toward suicide14), and Art's com parison of his own troubles with those of his mother suggests the problematic conflation of her traumatized past with his inheritance of his parents' legacy, imply ing a childish and self-centered view on his part ("I don't wanna"). As a closing statement, however, Art's evocation of his depression seems fitting, for the page is inundated with the tragic events experienced by his family?their sur vival of Auschwitz (along with the mention of the hundreds of thousands who didn't survive), Anja's suicide, Vladek's heart attack. At the same time, Art's own experi</page><page sequence="15">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman's Maus 191 enees listed on the page function as the radical opposite to his parents' tragedy?his creative work, his new status as father, his success with Maus. The depression Art feels arises from the profound incompatibility of his successful contemporary life with the tragic lives of his parents and, by extension, with those of European Jewry. Their experiences can't be assimilated into a well-ordered notion of history and fam ily legacy; as happens frequently in Maus, they jut outside the established frame into the surrounding narrative, refusing to stay integrated into a fully comprehended and comprehensible past. Although the events of Art's life give credence to the illusion that he has overcome his parents' trauma and that his life has developed beyond their memory, the fractured chronology he experiences belies the notion of development and moving on. Art becomes a prisoner in this realm of static and dislocated tempo rality. Like the bodies on which Art's table is propped, the past is left unburied and continues to haunt the present by its very presence. This feeling of the past's presence, of the presence of death in life, is under scored by the last verbal statement on the page, the only one that does not issue from Art. A voice from the scene says, "Alright Mr. Spiegelman. . . . We're ready to shoot!" Although we don't know who utters this statement and are therefore unaware of the context of its utterance, the composition of the mise-en-sc?ne, with its corpses, watchtower, and searchlight, encourages an alarming interpretation. For a moment it seems as if Art is about to be called before a firing squad (which might explain an other use for his mask) or some other equally frightening and deathly situation, and will soon end up as one of the corpses that dominate the bottom of the page. At the same time, the speaker's use of the formal "Mr. Spiegelman" implies that the situa tion is not really as violent as the word "shoot" and the macabre mise-en-sc?ne would lead one to believe. And, indeed, when one turns the page, one immediately sees in the first panel a television film crew ready to film an interview, clambering to turn his father's story into a "human interest" story on the morning talk shows, or perhaps even to "shoot" it as a commercial film or television movie, indicating the commercial momentum Spiegelman's Maus project has gained despite his adamant wishes to the contrary ("I don't wanna"). The image of the TV crew thus contextual izes the meaning of "to shoot" as a much less threatening force of the present, de spite the image of pushy journalists climbing over dead bodies to obtain interviews and the specter of a possible kitschy Maus movie.15 But for the reader, who for the last two hundred or so pages has been immersed in the world in which people are more likely to be shot by guns than by a camera, the first moment of the utterance is one in which the Holocaust past does seem to take over Art's present. The first page of the "Auschwitz (time flies)" chapter thus situates the reader within a temporality in which the Holocaust past is felt as a present force, a residue of the then that is keenly perceived as existent in the now. The next few pages of text continue in the same vein as the first, albeit less powerfully, proceeding according to the narrative logic that Spiegelman designates as the super-present. Accompanied vi sually by the time flies and the harsh searchlight, Art further explores the problems that he encounters as a result of the Maus project. He contends with the media that pressure him into producing quick sound bites that encapsulate a quick and easy "Holocaust message" for a public that wants to settle the score with the past, turning</page><page sequence="16">192 Erin McGlothlin him into a kind of "poster child" for the Holocaust (which causes him to shrink both physically and emotionally into a child). In addition, he is confronted with a pub lishing and marketing machine that assumes his aesthetic project of testimony and transforms it into a consumer product, turning him into a best-selling author and a darling on the talk-show circuit. Overwhelmed by the media attention and the atten dant problems of commercial success, Art visits his psychiatrist, a survivor of the Holocaust himself, with whom he discusses his depression, feelings of remorse and inadequacy with regard to his father, and the problems he has of imagining his fa ther's experiences, of shaping them narratively and "picturing" them in the visual logic of the Maus narrative. At the end of this section of the super-present, he returns home to his desk, still clad in the mask and bathed in the searchlight, and attempts to continue his work. Art's last utterance before the return to the middle diegetic level, the scene of Vladek's testimony, is a weary "sigh" (II41), an overwhelmed and be wildered response to the overpowering presence of Vladek's past. POLYCHRONIC NARRATION AND TIMELESSNESS These pages of the super-present mark a different kind of time structure than exists in the other narrative levels in Maus, pointing to a temporal problematic that David Herman investigates in his book on narratology, Story Logic. Herman's book calls into question the usefulness of assigning all narrative to the absolute binary of story and discourse, arguing instead for a new way of looking at the broader "ecol ogy of narrative interpretation"(13), a shift in theoretical perspective that would allow more for the ways in which the mode of narrating interacts with that being nar rated. In terms of the temporal relations between the poles of story and discourse, Herman posits the notion of polychrony, a temporal designation that takes into ac count narratives in which the then and the now are not clearly and unequivocally de lineated. He bases his concept of polychrony, or "fuzzy temporality," on recent research on fuzzy logic, which "operates on the basis of multivalence as opposed to bivalence" (212). Herman argues for a multivalent approach to narrative time in re sponse to what he sees as a deficiency in existing narratological frameworks of tem porality, particulary those of G?rard Genette. According to Herman, Genette relegates events that the reader is unable to order into the bivalent temporal frame work of then and now to a realm outside of the normative temporal logic of narrative, which Genette terms timelessness or achrony. For Herman, however, the inability to order a narrative event according the larger, more definite temporal sequence of the narrative does not mean that the event does not possess a connection (however hid den) to the established temporality, or that it hangs suspended outside of the tempo ral plane altogether. Not knowing the exact time designation of an event thus does not make it timeless. Herman proposes reconfiguring the framework of temporality within a system of multivalence, which would include both events that are identifi able according to the binary of then and now and those that do not adhere to the bi nary: "When it involves events being assigned indeterminate temporal positions in a storyworld, fuzzy temporality likewise reconfigures the concepts of 'earlier' and</page><page sequence="17">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman's Maus 193 'later' as special limiting cases in a multivalent system. What I am calling poly chronic narration entails a three-value system spanning Earlier, Later and Indetermi nate, where, again, Indeterminate is shorthand for Indeterminately-situated vis-?-vis-some-temporal-reference-point-X" (212-13). Herman's notion of a multivalent system that includes events that aren't easily ordered into specific temporal designations as well as textual strategies that resist conventional narrative frameworks is of critical relevance to the complex temporal planes found in Spiegelman's text, for, as we have seen, Maus resists the same biva lent temporal logic against which Herman argues. In particular, Herman's linking of poly chronic narrative strategies to the textual effects of trauma, memory, and forget ting in narratives by Anna Seghers, Atom Egoyan, and D. M. Thomas demonstrates how texts like Maus, which as we have seen involves "the reconstruction of a trau matic event from the past whose effects live on in and mold a present that in turn gives shape to that past" (Herman 237), require a more complex temporal framework in order to express traumatic elements that cannot be easily evoked within a rigid bi valent system. The openness of Herman's theory of mulitvalence, which goes be yond the binary of then and now, thus provides us with a useful vocabulary for examining Maus's intricate temporality. However, despite our ability to designate Maus as polychronic, it is not so easy to align it with the problematic which occupies Herman's analysis, for the temporal difficulty of Spiegelman's text is not one of indeterminacy, the third term in Her man's framework. On the contrary, the temporality of the super-present relates to problems of determinacy, not to the specific designation of indeterminacy. As my close reading of the first page of "Auschwitz (time flies)" indicates, this narrative level of Maus grapples with a temporality that is simultaneously adeterminate, overdetermined, and clearly determined. Adeterminacy is, as I have argued, a defin ing quality of the super-present; this temporal plane seems to exist outside the expe rience of time in the timeless, static space of memory. The image of Art at a drawing table perched upon a pile of corpses is perhaps the best example of this disconnected, disjointed time that is neither part of the developing present nor a part of the calcified past. Despite the super-present's state of suspension above past and present, how ever, its temporality is not indeterminate; indeed, the opposite is the case: Art con spicuously names the exact time frame during which he sits at the drawing table ("I started working on this page at the very end of February 1987"). Time in this narra tive mode does not so much refuse to be ordered into a linear chronology as exempt itself from the notion of a moving and developing temporality altogether, and thus the temporal problematic is not one of determining the order of the event, a task that occupies much narratological analysis of time. Furthermore, the temporal aspects of this part of Spiegelman's text are overdetermined as well; the litany of dates and traumatic experiences that accompany the image of Art at the drawing table testify to the power that time and its markers have over Art's project. The timeless, adetermi nate quality of the time structure of the super-present does not mean that time is somehow unimportant for Art; rather, in these images he is hyper-invested in the issue of temporality, experiencing the very painful effects of a fractured chronology of family experience. Moreover, the notion of indeterminacy is not only irrelevant</page><page sequence="18">194 Erin McGlothlin for the pages of the super-present, it is not a factor in the rest of Maus either. Throughout the narrative, despite complex shifts back and forth between Vladek's Holocaust past, Art's witnessing present, and the atemporal plane of the super-pre sent, the reader is able to consistently assign the events a temporal designation, for the three temporal levels are, as I have demonstrated, clearly marked, an effect pro duced by Spiegelman's careful juxtaposition of verbal text and image. The temporal complexity o? Maus is thus not a problem of indeterminacy, and Herman's three-part framework, which revolves around the question of assigning an event a specific time within a chronological sequence, is inadequate for the discussion of the temporal complexity of the text. However, despite the limitations of Herman's specific tempo ral structure, his theory of polychronic narrative is an open one, for it is based on the concept of multivalence, which should by definition admit new temporal values. Polychrony, rather than closing itself off from the multiple ways in which time can operate in a narrative (as bivalent temporality does), can admit new positions to its spectrum?temporalities found in Maus and in other texts. Alongside Herman's cat egories of earlier, later, and indeterminate (temporal positions classified according to order), one can also mark out polychronic sites that concern other types of temporal ity, such as the subjective quality or experience of time. For this reason, one can argue for the r?int?gration of Genette's concept of timelessness into a multivalent understanding of temporality on the grounds that it expresses not the disruption of chronological order in the narrative, but the ways in which time is perceived and un derstood in different ways in the process of narration and the manner by which nar rative discourse is figured within the story that it produces. In the case of the super-present in Spiegelman's text, the past of Vladek's story, the present of Vladek's witnessing, and the timeless plane of Spiegelman's narrating merge, highlighting the ways in which the narrating of Maus pervades and is in turn permeated by the story and the discourse it narrates. The temporal structure of Maus is closely tied to the ways in which its narration functions; the multivalent temporal character of Spiegelman's text, with its adeterminate, overdetermined, and clearly determined aspects, exposes the ways in which different levels of narrative, like those of temporality, are experienced simultaneously and are consequently impli cated in each other. Rather than remaining fully distinguishable elements of a strictly delineated narrative system, the narrative categories of story, discourse, and narrat ing in Spiegelman's text commingle with each other, demonstrating that these classi fications, while providing useful vocabulary to the critic, are heuristic aids in the study of how narrative functions rather than absolute divisions that are somehow im manent in the nature of narrative itself. Just as his wearing of the mouse mask refers both to the textual world of his narrative fable and to the "real" world in which it is situated and from which the narrating emerges, the Art of the super-present encoun ters multiple aspects of both time and narrative function?the past of the Holocaust story, the present time of memory and discourse, and the timeless moment of narrat ing. Vladek's story does not remain a narrative of a concluded past, an experience that is dead and buried; rather, it is perceived as contemporaneous reality, a part of Art's life that cannot be relegated to the past tense. Although the gesture of narrating, of framing Vladek's past in narrative, is a move to solidify his Holocaust experience</page><page sequence="19">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman's Maus 195 and turn it into the then of history and keep it separate from the now of the present, the text acknowledges the impossibility of this move to neatly and decisively distin guish the traumatic past from the present of living and the story and discourse from the narrating instance that produces them. For in this third diegetic level o? Maus, the past is lived as part of the present, as a structure that continues to function and inform the present. The metaphor of the searchlight, which emanates from the watchtower and follows Art visually throughout these pages, is particularly useful for under standing this blurring of temporality and the inability to contain the past outside of the present. This searchlight is not Art's concentrated beam upon Vladek's past in order to shed light on it, explain it, and condense it into a "message," which is the os tensible goal of a project like Maus (at least that is the way the media see Art's book, even if he does not). Rather, the austere gleam of the searchlight issues from the past, from the watchtower of the Holocaust, and this harsh light emits directly onto Art and his present, illuminating the ways in which he continues to "live" the Holocaust even as he narrates it as a past event. The opening panels of "Auschwitz (time flies)," which cast the past as the source that sheds light on the present (while at the same time leaving much of that present in the darkness that surrounds the beam), thus function in an opposite way from the panels that began this discussion of Maus, the image of Vladek turning. In that image, as we have seen, Vladek turns "into" the past, and the present scene of storytelling becomes the past scene of experience. Rather than the past informing the present, seeking it out and casting light upon it, the turning Vladek of the present becomes the model for the representation of his past. In both instances, however, in the movement from present to past and in the movement from past to present, the Holocaust story and the present of narrating are figured as constitutive of one another, as inherently linked. Just as Art continues to bear witness to the effects of his father's past ("My father's ghost still hangs over me" [7/43]), his representation ofthat past is chained as well to the present in which he writes and draws. The temporalities that mark the traumatic experience of the Spiegelman family (the then of Vladek's story and the now of Art's storytelling) weave in, out, and among one another, each never allowing the other to exist in iso lation. Like the time flies that hover around Art, in Maus the past buzzes annoyingly around the present and the present swarms persistently around the past, neither leav ing the other in peace. ENDNOTES 1. Thomas Doherty remarks on the photographic and filmic qualities of Maus, which he claims take ad vantage of a "grammar of cinema" (79), and Spiegelman himself recognizes the book's parallel with film in the image of Vladek on the exercycle, which he calls "an analogue to the cinematic effect of the whirling wheel where Vladek begins to spin his yarn and you enter into the past for the first time through that wheel" (Complete Maus 6). 2. Following Hamida Bosmajian, I maintain the distinction between Artie, the character who listens to his father's stories, and Art, the character who reflects on his aesthetic project (Bosmajian 2). (The au thor of the entire Maus project will be designated as Spiegelman.) Spiegelman himself maintains the difference between Art and Artie in another way: Artie's statements (like those of Vladek and the</page><page sequence="20">196 Erin McGlothlin other characters in both the Holocaust story and the retelling of it) are designated by uppercase char acters. Art's meta-reflections, on the other hand, are represented by lower-case print (Complete Maus 178). 3. Dan Shen, in her recent essay on Genette's tripartite system of classification, explores the ways in which Genette's theoretical model of story, discourse, and narrating degenerates in practice into a di chotomy between story and discourse. Shen persuasively demonstrates that the instance of narrating, in the event that it is even accessible to the reader, always integrates itself into either the story or the discourse. The problem of the purity of the narrating instance, as this essay will reveal, is also relevant for discussion of Maus, but I will retain Genette's distinction between the three terms for the moment because it is very helpful for understanding how Spiegelman structures time in his text. 4. In order that my analysis correspond to previous scholarship on Maus, I am reversing G?rard Genette's classification of diegetic levels, which labels the outermost narrative as the first diegetic level, the middle narrative as a narrative of the first degree, and the innermost narrative as a narrative of the second degree. In contrast to Genette, critics of Maus (with the exception of Tabachnick) have organized Maus narratively from the inside out. 5. Since a number of critics have written very good analyses of Spiegelman's use (and potential abuse) of the animal metaphor and the ways in which Maus deconstructs its own representational logic, I will not explore the issue in depth here. Particularly insightful interpretations include those by Do minick LaCapra, Marianne Hirsch, Keith Harrison, Jeanne C. Ewert, James E. Young, Andreas Huyssen, and Michael E. Staub. 6. Several critics compare the use of masks in the "Auschwitz (time flies)" chapter with Vladek's and Anja's employment of them in Maus I (Hirsch, Martin, Harrison). While Art's donning of the mouse mask certainly refers to Vladek's and Anja's attempt at "passing" outside the ghetto by wearing pig masks and reminds the reader of the problematic and sometimes arbitrary nature of the construction of racial and ethnic identities, both during the Holocaust and in the present, there are crucial differ ences between the two uses of the mask. In Art's case, the mask is worn over a human head, reflect ing on the strange and "unnatural" gesture of posing as an animal and thus to the aesthetic strategy of depicting a human story in animal form. In the case of Vladek and Anja, they are portrayed as an thropomorphized (but not human) mice wearing the masks of another animal. Although their masking calls attention to the construction of identity, it does not problematize the representational logic that governs both the first and second narrative levels. 7. Of course, this is not the only device in Maus that reflects on the problem of using the animal trope. Other examples that call into question the representational rule include Anja's fear of rats in the cel lar in which the couple hides and Vladek's assurances that the rats are only harmless mice (I 147), Artie's discussion with his French wife Fran?oise about which animal to cast her as (// 11-12), and Art's comments when he goes to see his analyst: "His place is overrun with stray dogs and cats. Can I mention this, or does it completely louse up my metaphor?" (7/43). 8. Dominick LaCapra does not believe that it can be established with certainty that the faces underneath the masks are indeed human: "When figures wear explicit animal masks (for example, Artie, his TV interviewers, or his analyst), it remains unclear whether there are human faces beneath or whether there are masks all the way down. This mise en ab?me or bottomless multiplication of the mask may be one of the most radical gestures in problematizing identity" (163). Although I find LaCapra's ar gument that the mask displaces any notion of essential identity very compelling, I would disagree with his assertion that the heads under the mask are not identifiably human, for the backs of Art's, Pavel's, and the journalists' human heads are clearly depicted in several of the panels. 9. Genette argues that, at least in narratives of Western culture, the temporal is much more important than the spatial with regard to the narrating instance. "I can very well tell a story without specifying the place where it happens, and whether this place is more or less distant from the place where I am telling it; nevertheless, it is almost impossible for me not to locate the story in time with respect to my narrating act, since I must necessarily tell the story in a present, past or future tense" (215).</page><page sequence="21">Narrative and Time in Spiegelman 's Maus 197 10. Paradoxically, although there is no real narrative development in the moments of Maus's super-pre sent, Spiegelman employs this temporality in which nothing "happens" in order to induce some nar rative movement within the book as a whole, to get things going: "It was the only way I could move forward to make the obstacles manifest" (Complete Maus 178). 11. "If one were tempted to object that Spiegelman himself does in a sense figure Auschwitz (or Mauschwitz) as Mickey-Mouse land (although he intentionally did not draw the endearing, infan tilized types of animals that appear in Disney cartoons), it would be equally important to note that his more challenging move is to bring Auschwitz to Mickey-Mouse land, that is to bring the Holocaust past to the America that must have seemed to survivors like a Disneyworld in its distance from their experience" (LaCapra 160). 12. Michael E. Staub sees the black-and-white contrast as part of a larger symbol that can neither be seen nor taken in completely by the reader: "Behind him [Art], shifting right angles of black and white light?like pieces of a swastika?frame the action" (42). 13. I am grateful to my student, Anne F?lting, from the Universit?t Dortmund, for pointing this out: "With writing Maus I, Art has awakened the past?symbolized in the corpses accumulated all around his writing-desk. It seems as if all those people had to die again because Art told the story of their death." F?lting also makes the connection between Art's "perpetration" and the subtitle of the first volume, My Father Bleeds History, asserting that Art, through his questioning of Vladek, has opened up his wounds and made them bleed again. 14. Anja expresses her despair and suicidal wishes three times during the course of the novel, both before and during the German occupation: "But I don't care. I just don't want to live" (7 31); "Oh God. Let me die too!" (1122); "Each day I think to run into the electric wires and finish everything" (77 53). Marianne Hirsch and James Young, among others, have discussed the absence, "displacement and violation" of Anja's story (Young 11), alluding to Vladek's destruction of her diaries and Artie's ac cusation of his father as the "murderer" of her memory. However, critics have ignored Spiegelman's depiction of Anja's own radical tendency toward self-destruction, as well as Vladek's tender words of encouragement to her to stay alive: "No, darling! To die, it's easy ... but you have to struggle for life!" (1122); "I beg you, Anja?keep yourself strong. For my sake ... I... I think about you ... al ways" (II56). This reversal of the image of Vladek as Anja's "murderer" is but another example of the ways in which Spiegelman juxtaposes contradictory images and information about both himself and his parents and thus avoids any easy attempt to fit them into generalized characterizations. 15. This image of the journalists prefigures one of Vladek's most despairing experiences in the entire book, in which he, as a typhoid prisoner in Dachau, is forced to tread upon corpses. As he explains this horrific experience, the accompanying graphics show his feet stepping on a pile of dead mice, cats, and pigs, echoing literally (with the metaphorical device of the animal fable) the metaphorical trampling of the journalists: "At night I had to go to the toilet down. It was always full, the whole cor ridor, with the dead people piled there. You couldn't go through.... you had to go on their heads, and this was terrible, because it was so slippery, the skin, you thought you are falling, and this was every night. So now I had typhus, and I had to go to the toilet down, and I said, 'Now it's my time. Now I will be laying like this ones and somebody will step on me!" (II95). Vladek survives the typhus and does not experience that horror literally, but the image of the journalists who step over the corpses suggests the roughshod trampling of his memory posthumously.
