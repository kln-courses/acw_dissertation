<plain_text><page sequence="1">59 WHO IS HOLDING THE LEAD ROPE? THE RELIEF OF THE BROKEN OBELISK By tallay ornan The step-topped, free-standing square monument called in modern literature the Broken Obelisk was found by Hormuzd Rassam at Nineveh, near the Ishtar temple on the mound of Kuyunjik. It is the earliest monument of this kind, and it differs in its pictorial rendering from the later, so-called Assyrian obelisks. Whereas the succeeding examples display reliefs on their four sides, creating consecutive narratives, the Broken Obelisk exhibits a single, motionless relief on its front, the subject of the present paper (B?rker-Kl?hn 1982, Nos. 132, 138-45, 152; B?r 1996, 57-68, 88-99, 101-5, 148-65).1 My aim here is to shed light on the motif of the king holding prisoners of war by means of lead ropes and to examine the bearing of this motif on the status of the royal image in pictorial renderings. According to different interpretations of the scene, the king holds a ring and rod (B?rker-Kl?hn 1982, 178, No. 131 with earlier bibliography), or a ceremonial mace (Russell 2003, 4) as well as lead rope(s) with which he binds prisoners of war standing in front of him (e.g. Pritchard 1969, 300, No. 440; Strommenger 1964, 437, PL 188, bottom; B?rker-Kl?hn 1982, 178; Collon 1995, 117; Russell 2003, 4). My initial interest in the iconography of the Broken Obelisk was aroused by the fact that on it the so-called ring and rod symbols of kingship granted by the gods, are held by the king,2 whereas usually they are held by a deity in compositions conveying the very act of the divine giving (Hallo 2005, 150-1, 161; Suter 2000, 6-7; Oman 2005, 12). The sources for the present study of the carved panel of the Broken Obelisk are, as suggested by Reade (2005, 373), the photographs taken before the cleaning of the monument carried out in the late 1960s (e.g. Paterson 1907, PL LXIII, or Smith 1928, PL XVII, see the preceding article in this volume [= Curtis 2007], Fig. 3). The conclusions presented here were reaffirmed by an examination of the monument carried out in July 2006. The need for the new examination of the monument was motivated by a photograph taken after the aforementioned cleaning, published in a popular Japanese book, on which details previously not observed seemed to appear (Aoyagi and Sasaki 2000, 84, Fig. 67). Such photographs are, however, to be treated with caution, as advocated by John Curtis in this volume (see Curtis 2007, Fig. 4).3 It was Weidner in 1930-1 who first assigned all five columns of the inscribed part of the monument to Ashur-bel-kala (1073-1056 bc). These five columns are inscribed on three of the monument's faces. Columns i and ii are written on either side of the sculpted relief, on the front face of the monument. Column i includes an invocation to the gods and the name and epithets of the king. Column ii reports the rebuilding of a temple to Anu and Adad at Ashur (Grayson 1991, 100-1). Column iii, found on the right side of the monument, enumerates the military ^he monument (BM WA 118898) is made of hard, whitish stone. Its present height is 40 cm, the extant height of the sculpted sunken relief is 23.5 cm and its width is 23.5 cm, thus creating a square pictorial niche within an inscribed surface. The depth of the relief measured from its surface at the higher left corner is 1.5 cm. Variations in the height of the extant background surface of the relief suggest that the ancient artist worked it unevenly, although it should not be ruled out that such differences could have occurred or been increased by the modern treatment of the monument. For reservations as to the use of the term "obelisk" for this type of Assyrian monument, see B?r 1996, 57 note 319, and see Bunnens (2005, 21) for com parison with the square sculpted panel inserted within a text on the Banquet Stela of Ashurnasirpal II. 2 Rare depictions where the "ring and rod" are carried by a deity without the royal presence, such as shown on the Burney relief (Curtis and Collon 1996; see Collon in this volume, Fig. 1), may reflect the observation (Krecher 1976-80, 114) that while the rod and the nose rope were associated with both kings and gods, the ring {kippatu) was related only to deities and mainly found in later periods (CAD, 8, kippatu (lc), 398). For first-millennium repre sentations of gods carrying the two insignia without the king see Spycket 2000, 655-66, Figs. 9, 10 (with earlier bibliography). 31 am grateful to Dominique Collon, co-editor of Iraq, for drawing my attention to the unfortunate results of the cleaning of the monument in 1968-9 and for enabling me to read John Curtis's paper in this volume before it went to press. My sincere thanks to Paul Collins of the Depart ment of the Middle East in the British Museum, for per mission to check the monument and for his kind help.

The location of the sculpted relief on the front, between Columns i and ii, implies that the monument was standing next to or against a wall. The uninscribed left side and the lacunae in columns i and iv suggest that the text was not finished. I. The relief "(Fig. 1) 1.1. The lead ropes The scene sculpted within the squared niche depicts a king identified by his conspicuous position in the scene, standing on the left and facing four smaller figures of subdued enemies. Above the enemies, a little higher than the king's head, are five divine symbols: a horned mitre, a crescent, a winged disc, a lightning bolt, and a star or rosette. The king extends his right palm towards a large bow handed to him by a pair of hands emerging from the winged disc, which is positioned in the centre of the row of divine emblems. The acts of the heavenly giving of the bow on the one hand, and the royal receiving on the other hand, are visually expressed by the interplay between the upward-facing large right palm of the king and the downward-facing left hand of the divinity (cf. Westenholz 2000, 109-10, 115-17). It should be noted that our examination of the monument found no trace of arrow(s) handed down to the king, as has previously been suggested. In his left hand, the king holds a large looped rope, previously interpreted as a ring (B?rker Kl?hn 1982, 178), from which two parallel ropes extend to reach the left hand of the rear figure of the first pair of captives who stand in front of the king. The large ring-shaped loop is identified as representing a coiled rope by its marking of hatched diagonals denoting rope-like material; such markings typify other rope elements sculpted on the relief and are frequently found denoting ropes on Neo-Assyrian monuments (e.g. Barnett et al. 1998, Pis. 96-8, 122-3). A lower rope, which comes out from the lower part of the loop ? observed on the monument in its present Fig. 1 The Broken Obelisk, Nineveh, front wall (after Curtis 2007, Figs. 1 to 4. Drawing by P.

Fig. 3 The Iran Stela (reproduced courtesy of The Israel Museum). state (Curtis 2007, Fig. 4) does not appear on earlier photographs (e.g. Curtis 2007 Figs. 2-3) and has not been taken into consideration here. A much earlier prototype of a ring-shaped coiled rope is found on the second register from the top on side A of the Ur-Namma stela. However, in contrast to the depiction on the Broken Obelisk, where it is carried by the king, on the Ur-Namma stela the coil of rope with its hanging end is held by a deity, the god Nanna (Canby 2001, 9 and note 66, 19; Hallo 2005, 151). Two lines hanging downward from the left side of the looped rope probably represent the two ends of the above-mentioned two ropes, although the hatched diagonals are faint. Following Reade's recommendation, we prefer to see the object held by the king alongside the coil of rope as a mace or mace-headed sceptre, as is commonly suggested (e.g. Russell 2003, 4). It is the</page><page sequence="4">62 TALLAY ORNAN hatched diagonals on the two lines encircling the king's waist which imply that he actually wears two ropes as a belt. Two daggers are stuck into this rope belt; such daggers are often shown in first-millennium depictions of Assyrian kings (e.g. on the Banquet Stela of Ashurnasirpal, cf. B?rker-Kl?hn 1982, No. 137). As the rope belt is not visually linked to the large looped rope, we can only speculate on the manner in which it joined the ropes held by the king. In spite of the lack of pictorial connection, it seems not inconceivable that the double-rope belt continued in a straight line. The missing part of the double-rope belt is thus concealed by the king's left wrist. The depiction of the double-rope belt, the king's wrist and his closed palm on the same horizontal plane may corroborate the latter reconstruction. 1.2. Neo-Assyrian rope belts Our observation that Ashur-bel-kala is wearing a double-rope belt which was part of the lead ropes with which he tied the captives brings to mind the stela of Esarhaddon from Sam'al (Zinjirli), where the king is also wearing a rope belt (Fig. 2; Magen 1986, 24, 55, 127, and 137 regarding the Broken Obelisk). The rope belt of Esarhaddon differs, however, from that of Ashur-bel-kala in a number of details. First, Esarhaddon's belt is made of one solid thick rope and not of two thin ones. Second, the rope belt of Esarhaddon is also shown on his chest ? possibly hinting that it was tied to his neck. Third, while on the Broken Obelisk the captives are "bound" only by ropes, the lead ropes held by Esarhaddon end in rings fastened to the captives' lips. Fourth, in contrast to the depiction on the Broken Obelisk there is a difference in workmanship between the leashes and the belt on the stela of Esarhaddon, which indicates that they were made of different materials. While the hatched diagonals on the belt mark it as a rope, the plain texture of the leashes hint that they were made of another material, probably leather. Despite these differences, the very depiction of Esarhaddon wearing a rope belt (and holding a ring-shaped looped leash) in a pictorial context so similar in layout and subject matter ? an Assyrian king facing right and holding captives on leashes in the presence of the gods ? reinforces our observation that a rope belt is also depicted on the Broken Obelisk, as shown on Fig. 1. That the relief of the Broken Obelisk is rightly considered an early example that could have inspired Esarhaddon's stela from Zinjirli (B?rker-Kl?hn 1982, 213, No. 219), adds extra support to our reconstruction of Ashur-bel-kala holding captives with ropes physically attached to his body. The variance in details concerning the manner in which the rope belt is depicted on the two monuments can partially be explained by the iconographical modifications that may have occurred in the course of almost three hundred years between the two monuments. The reappearance of the rope belt on Esarhaddon's stela confirms, nevertheless, the continuity of an iconographical tradition, which combined Middle and Neo-Assyrian imagery. In spite of the fact that the rope belt of Esarhaddon is depicted as a separate garment accessory, with no physical connection to the leashes, as in the depiction on the Broken Obelisk, its iconographical context highlights its meaning: the king is depicted as a subduing, triumphant conqueror. The rope belt as a royal garment accessory is found in other representations of Assyrian kings. Sargon II wears a belt on his stela from north-west Iran, probably originally erected at Godin Tepe (Levine 1972, 27, PI. 7; Magen 1986, 126(V), PI. 9:3), and traces of a rope belt are observed on the Iran Stela of Tiglath-pileser III from the Zagros Mountains (Fig. 3; Tadmor 1994, PI. XXXIII; Magen 1986, PI. 9:1). To these we may add the free-standing statue of Ashurnasirpal II from the temple of Belet-mati at Nimrud, who is also wearing a rope belt (Strommenger 1970, 13-14, Fig. 2, PI. I).4 The representations of the rope belt on the Broken Obelisk and on the stela of Esarhaddon ? in both cases in compositions including bound enemies ? suggest that rope belts shown in other contexts, where no tied enemies are depicted, also signified the victorious king who masters his enemies like a man leading an animal (cf. the Mari wall painting, Parrot 1961, 276, Fig. 344). The pictorial and textual metaphor of the lead rope (serretu), which probably also included the rope belt, signified dominion. It probably did not mirror the shepherds' life (Magen 1986, 18, 113, Table 30) but, rather, reflected the manner by which bulls were led in 4 Magen (1986, 74, PI. 14:1) assigns Ashurnasirpal's statue to Type IVb of the royal images, which represented the kings as purification priests (isippu).</page><page sequence="5">WHO IS HOLDING THE LEAD ROPE? 63 agricultural communities (Westenholz 2004, 301; Hallo 2005, 152). The combination of the lead rope in martial pictorial contexts fits the specific meaning of the metaphor, apparent in Neo Assyrian royal propaganda, which denoted the right of the king to govern foreign peoples (Magen 1986, 24). 1.3. The captives The captives in front of Ashur-bel-kala are divided into two groups each consisting of a pair of two standing figures. The two pairs are carefully differentiated: the pair directly in front of the king is larger than the pair at the back, a distinction conveying the higher rank of the former. While the two front captives wear conical floppy caps with dangling tips and incised with horizontal grooves, the captives behind them wear only headbands.5 Furthermore, although the two binding ropes only reach the left arm of the back figure of the front pair, we may speculate that they were aimed at both front captives. The pictorial articulation here is not clear, and it seems that the ancient artist could not deal with overlapping elements, in particular when depicting the ropes tied to the captives. A somewhat ill-articulated visual convention, probably aimed at creating an impression of depth, is also reflected in the representation of the two captives further away from the beholder as higher than their counterparts nearer the viewer. In this way, the artist possibly tried to overcome the problem of the concealment of the two rear captives by the front ones. However, as is frequently found in similar Neo-Assyrian cases, the rear figures could have been depicted at the same height as the front ones with their bodies only partially overlapped by the figures closer to the onlooker (e.g. Barnett et al 1998, PI. 91). The floppy caps worn by the first two captives seem to represent hats made of narrow strips of fabric wound around the head and ending in dangling tips, the horizontal grooves seen on these caps probably mark the wrapping of the fabric, thus creating a high oval shape. Caps of this type, worn by foreigners bringing tribute to Assyria, appear in first-millennium Assyrian representations. A cap marked with horizontal grooves recalling the caps on the Broken Obelisk, but without the dangling tip, for example, is sported by inhabitants from Carchemish depicted on wall reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II from the North-West palace at Nimrud and on the bronze bands of Shalmaneser Ill's Balawat Gates (W?fler 1975, 218, 224, Figs. 134, 138). A similar variant of the floppy cap, with crossed bands of fabric and a short pointed tip, adorns tribute bearers from Bit-Adini depicted on the bronze bands of the Balawat Gates and on some Nimrud ivories (W?fler 1975, 201, 202, 211, Fig. 123). However, since no exact parallel to the floppy caps on the Broken Obelisk has been found, it is difficult to offer a precise identification of its wearers. Moreover, because non-Assyrians from many Assyrian provinces are often displayed on Neo-Assyrian monuments dressed in variants of the pointed floppy cap with dangling tip,6 no precise ethnic identification can be based on the use of these headdresses. That this type of soft head-covering became a generalised way of denoting the enemies of Assyria is demonstrated on the Black Obelisk by the depiction of Sua of Gilzanu and Jehu of Israel wearing the same type of cap, though from opposite extremes of the Assyrian empire (B?rker-Kl?hn 1982, 191, No. 152 AI, A2; Marcus 1987, 87-8; Keel and Uehlinger 1994, 403-4; B?r 1996, 150, 162, 174). All that can be said, then, is that the pointed floppy cap was already a specific feature indicating Assyria's rivals during the first half of the eleventh century.7 The variations in detail, and consequently in status, between the two pairs of captives suggest that their pictorial description can be regarded as a specific depiction of different enemy groups that were subdued by Ashur-bel-kala. This type of specific representation of bound prisoners of war diverges from an earlier, generic Middle Assyrian forerunner of the theme rendered on the plinth of one of the two decorated stone pedestals of Tukulti-Ninurta I from Ashur, on which a row of captives is led in mountainous surroundings (Fig. 4). A generic depiction of a bound prisoner is also found on the White Obelisk (register 5 of side B), where an unidentified prisoner 5 A horizontal strip comprised of small circles decorat ing the hem of the dress of the front back captive (Curtis 2007, Fig. 4) is not visible on the earlier photographs (Curtis 2007, Figs. 1-3), and also seems to be a recent addition. 6Cf. W?fler 1975, 83-4, Figs. 47, 55 (Phoenicia), 121, Fig. 63 (Damascus), 163-4, 170, Fig. 87 (Unqi-Pattina). 7 See, however, W?fler (1975, 83, 110-11 and note 564) who associates the floppy caps of the Broken Obelisk with the Phoenicians.</page><page sequence="6">64 TALLAY ORNAN is led by an Assyrian official who stands at the end of a row of four officials approaching the king (Pittman 1996, 351). The specific representation of the captives combined with the information given in the inscription on the Broken Obelisk may aid us in their identification. As recorded in the text, the main enemies of Ashur-bel-kala were the Arameans, who actively resisted Assyrian domination in the late twelfth to eleventh centuries, as documented in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser I and in other inscriptions of Ashur-bel-kala (Grayson 1991, 5, 86; Dion 1997, 15-21, 30-1). This phase of the encounters between the Assyrians and the Arameans, designated as Aramaean proto-history in north Syria (Zadok 1991, 105), was characterized by tribal organization and preceded the urbanization and the consolidation of the state at the beginning of the ninth century (Sader 2000; Bonatz 2001, 73). The conspicuous role of the Arameans in the inscription on the Broken Obelisk, mentioned sixteen times in column iii as taking part in military clashes with the Assyrians,8 implies that the two pairs of prisoners can be identified as Arameans, representing two different tribal leaders, perhaps followed by representatives of their peoples. If, indeed, we may identify the captives standing before Ashur-bel-kala as Arameans we have here not only a specific historical pictorial allusion but also an explicit relationship between text and image transmitted on the same artefact. Since a correspondence between text and image is an important and recurrent feature of Neo-Assyrian narrative sculpture, we may view the Broken Obelisk as a harbinger of the visual historical representations that gradually dominated Neo Assyrian palace reliefs during the first millennium (Oman, 2005, 83 with bibliography). II. Sources of inspiration II. 1. Relation to Babylonian kudurms The suggested correlation between text and picture on the Broken Obelisk brings to mind some relief scenes rendered on Middle Babylonian kudurrus, which are usually sculpted with divine symbols guaranteeing divine confirmation of the transactions documented in the text (Seidl 1989). However, as shown by Slanski, scenes implicitly relating to factual events dealt with in the accompanying texts are found on the kudurrus of Nazi-Marutash (1307-1282) and Meli-Shipak (1186-1172), as well as on some first-millennium examples. The monument of Nazi-Marutash depicts a large image of a dog, the symbol of Gula, whose exceptional dimensions correspond to the major role of the goddess in the accompanying text (Slanski 2003, 142-3). The second kudurru shows Meli-Shipak leading his daughter, Hunnubat-Nanaya, into the presence of Nanaya in a scene matching the accompanying text, which relates to a gift given by Meli-Shipak to his daughter. The close connection between text and image is also emphasized on this artefact by the depiction of the censer (nignakku), also mentioned in the text (Slanski 2003, 142). The Babylonian inspiration for the correspondence between picture and text on the Broken Obelisk, suggested by the above examples, is supported by the emblematic renderings of the deities on the upper part of the relief, highly characteristic of Babylonian representations. These reflections of Babylonian imagery in Assyrian art during the reign of Ashur-bel-kala may have been an outcome of the actual Assyrian domination of Babylonia at that time (Grayson 1991, 86; Oman 2005, 45-50, 56). II.2. Egyptian depictions of captives led by ropes In addition to the Babylonian inspiration on the relief of the Broken Obelisk we should also consider some Egyptian traits that may have inspired its theme and some of its details, in particular the use of a lead rope for tying prisoners of war in a triumphant context. Holding a subdued enemy by a lead rope is an age-old Egyptian motif already depicted on the Narmer Palette, where the head of the vanquished foe, representing the inhabitants of the Delta region, is tied to a rope grasped by the falcon representing the god Horus, of whom the Egyptian king was the living manifestation (Robins 1997, 33).9 Fettered prisoners, each also tied to a lead rope, are depicted 8 Starting with the inscriptions of Ashur-bel-kala, the term used for the Arameans is Aramiyya and not the older compound Ahlamu-Aramayya (Zadok 1991, 104). 9 The two long-necked mythical animals held by ropes on the other side of the palette (Robins 1997, 34, Fig. 25 bottom) reinforce the meaning of the rope here as a divine and royal vehicle for the subjugation of chaos.</page><page sequence="7">who is holding the lead rope? 65 Fig. 4 Cult pedestal of Tukulti-Ninurta I (Oman 2005, Fig. 53). Fig. 5 A fettered captive, fragment of an Akkadian stone vessel (after Parrot 1961, Fig. 229 and B?nder 1995, PL 50. Drawing by P. Arad). on a Fifth Dynasty relief from the Mortuary Temple of Sahure at Abusir. Individually bound Syro-Palestinian captives tied as groups by a (thin) lead rope held by Seti I (1318-1301 bc) were sculpted on the exterior north wall of the Great Hall at Karnak. Similarly, on the reliefs of the Great Temple at Abu Simbel, Ramses II presents to the gods captives bound with a lead rope. A later example, closer in date to the Broken Obelisk, is the depiction of the Sea Peoples on the Twentieth Dynasty painted reliefs of Ramses III (1192-1160 bc) at Medinat Habu. As in the previous case, here too the captives are each separately and differently fettered, while at the same time bound as a group, and are led either by the king to the god, or by an official to the king.10 A diplomatic relationship between Assyria and Egypt is documented in column iv of the Broken Obelisk which reports on exotic animals given to Ashur-bel-kala by the Egyptian king, and could have helped introduce an Egyptian motif to the relief scene of the monument.11 Such inspiration accords well with the influence of historical renderings of Egyptian art during the New Kingdom on Middle Assyrian imagery in general (Pittman 1996, 349-51) and, in particular, fits the display of the Arameans, whose subjugation is narrated in the accompanying text. Direct contact between late second-millennium Assyrians and Egyptian imagery could have occurred in such locations as the Nahr el-Kalb cliffs, where a rock relief attributed to Tiglath-pileser I is carved in close proximity to three reliefs of Ramses II (Shafer 1998, 319-20; Feldman 2003, 141).12 10Abusir: Pritchard 1969, No. 1. Karnak: Pritchard 1969, Nos. 323, 325-6 (also Feldman 2002, Fig. 15 with bibliography). Medinet Habu: The Epigraphic Survey 1930, Pis. 10, 11, 22; idem, 1970, Pis. 604, 606, 627. For Abu Simbel, see: http://oi.uchicago.edu/oi/mus/pa_egypt_bees_ images_abu_simbel. I am grateful to Shlomit Israeli for discussing the Egyptian parallels with me. 11 Another aspect of the Egyptian inspiration on the relief is illustrated by the pair of hands emerging from the winged disc shown at the centre of the row of divine symbols, which may echo the Amarna-period sun rays terminating in human hands (Oman 2005, 56-7). 12 The theme of captives drawn by a lead rope could also have reached Assyria through small portable artefacts, partly inspired by Egyptian martial compositions, such as the ivory plaque from Megiddo where two naked, fettered prisoners are bound to a triumphal war chariot (Liebowitz 1980, 165, 167, 169).</page><page sequence="8">66 TALLAY ORNAN II.3. Lead ropes in earlier Mesopotamian imagery However, the theme had earlier roots in Mesopotamia itself, and it can be postulated that the late second-millennium encounters with Egyptian art served as a stimulant for the revival of older themes, though with some modifications. A prisoner of war bound by a long rope and a nose ring appears on a fragmentary vessel, possibly made of chlorite (B?nder 1995, 149). It is said to have come from Uruk and stylistically is assigned to the Akkadian period, probably to the reign of Rimush or of Manishtushu (Fig. 5). A second rope depicted on the vessel, crossing diagonally behind his body, is reconstructed as tying another, now missing prisoner. The composition thus consists of a row of at least two captives each bound by a lead rope held by a now missing figure (B?nder 1995, 94-6, 149-50, No. 14, PI. 50). The theme of a group of captives bound by lead ropes, in particular the manner in which the lead ropes are drawn diagonally and pass behind the naked figure, firmly links this piece to the scene rendered on a non-provenanced stone mould carved in the mature Akkadian style (Hansen 2002, 101, Figs. 1-3).13 The sunken composition carved on the mould depicts the goddess Ishtar and a deified king, most probably Naram-Sin, seated next to each other on a stepped structure. In her left hand (on the impression) Ishtar grasps four lead ropes bound to the noses of defeated foes, shown below on the right: two divine enemies and two mortals. As on the vessel fragment (Fig. 5), where the rope passes behind the captive, the ropes seized by the goddess on the mould cross behind her body and terminate in a circular object, interpreted as a ring by Hansen (2002, 92, 95, 99). However, considering the martial context of the scene and the use of the nose ropes as a means of subduing enemies, it can be postulated that the "ring" held by Naram-Sin represents the schematized coiled part of the ropes to which the four enemies are bound.14 This identification may thus provide an early, Old Akkadian, prototype for the depiction on the Broken Obelisk and enhances the latent links connecting Akkadian and Middle Assyrian imagery, suggested more than forty years ago by Smith (1965, 110).15 The theme reappears on the relief of Anu-banini, dated to late Ur III period. The scene, sculpted on a high cliff near Sar-i Pul in the Zagros mountains, follows Akkadian prototypes such as the Victory Stela of Naram-Sin and the stone mould (Hansen 2002, 101). It shows Ishtar holding a lead rope terminating in rings fastened to the noses of two nude, kneeling prisoners (B?rker Kl?hn 1982, 138-9, No. 31). The goddess also holds a ring in her right hand that she extends towards the figure of the triumphant king. However, the lack of a rod, usually accompanying a "ring" held by a deity standing in front of a king, and the lead rope in Ishtar's left hand, may hint that this "ring" also represented the coiled part a lead rope, as depicted more than a thousand years later on the Broken Obelisk and on the later stela of Esarhaddon from Zinjirli.16 The impact of the Akkadian triumphal scenes, in particular the tethering of captives by nose rings and ropes, is apparent in miniature art, as shown on seal impressions of Attaia, servant of Shu-iliya, an independent ruler of Eshnunna late in the Ur III period (Frankfort et al., 1940, 202-3, 143, Fig. 100; Frayne 1997, 433, 436-7, E3/2.3.1.2002; Miglus 2003, 404, Fig. 19). As reconstructed, the original seal depicted Tishpak facing left and holding a "ring" and rod in front of Shu-iliya, who is wearing a short dress and carrying an axe in his right hand (Fig. 6). In his left hand Tishpak carries a similar axe from which a long and straight "shaft" descends, terminating in a nose ring. Another nose ring is attached to a straight rope descending towards the right from the god's belt. These nose-rings tether two enemies crouching back-to-back below the god while turning their heads towards him. The scene depicted on the impressions of Shu-iliya diverges from the former examples in depicting Tishpak rather than Ishtar as the deity who holds the lead ropes. This substitution is puzzling since, as shown on the artefacts and monuments discussed above, it was a female deity, 13 The Editors of Iraq do not wish the comments con cerning this piece to be taken as endorsing its authenticity. 14 On the identification of the "ring" (accompanied by the rod) in later depictions as associated with the ring of the nose rope see Hallo 2005, 151-3 and 159-61. 15 Compare also a 14th century Middle Elamite example of a coiled rope marked by hatched diagonals, which is found on the stela of Untash-Napirisha (Spycket 2000, 654). 16 Another contemporary example of a goddess standing before a triumphant king and holding a fallen captive by a lead rope, is shown on another rock relief from Sar-i Pul, see B?rker-Kl?hn (following Hrouda 1976) 1982, 139, 140 (for a discussion), No. 32. See, however, Seidl's reservations (2003, 50 and note 156).</page><page sequence="9">WHO IS HOLDING THE LEAD ROPE? 67 Fig. 6 Reconstructed seal impression of Attaya, servant of Shu-iliya, Eshnunna (Frankfort et al 1940, Fig. 100). most probably always Ishtar, who holds the captives with the ropes. The latter pictorial theme, indeed, accords well with textual evidence according to which it was only Ishtar who was entrusted with the role of seizing both men and kings with ropes (Magen 1986, 24; CAE) 16 S, 136, 4c). Even on the above-mentioned stone mould, where deified Naram-Sin participates with the goddess in holding the ropes, it is Ishtar who guides and controls the scene, as described by Hansen (2002, 99): .. these four ropes must also pass through the left hand of the goddess and thereby receive her divine warrant ...". An explanation of the unique representation of Tishpak as the rope holder may be found in the special status of Tishpak at Eshnunna. Tishpak was a newcomer god who, according to Wiggermann, infiltrated the pantheon of Eshnunna and replaced Ninazu as its head in the Akkadian period. This theological shift mirrored the Akkadian takeover of Eshnunna, reflected in the composition of the Labbu myth, aimed at sanctifying the status of Tishpak as the head of the local pantheon (Wiggerman 1989, 120, 123-6). Following this line, it seems not improbable that the late Ur III ruler of Eshnunna modified the Akkadian theme of Ishtar holding enemies with ropes, by replacing her with Tishpak in order to emphasize his role as the head of the gods of Eshnunna. The shaft-like form of the ropes on the impressions of Shu-iliya brings to mind a similar but thicker, plain "shaft" - shown as if touching the face of an enemy - depicted on the so-called Mardin (or Sinjar) stela, commonly attributed to Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria (Schlossman 1981-2, 162-4; Ismail 2003, 130 and note 3; Miglus 2003, 405-6; Grayson 1987, 63-5). Of the two reliefs sculpted one on each face of the Mardin Stela, the one that interests us here depicts three male figures: two facing each other and a third, who is collapsing between them. The man on the left is wearing a short dress and trampling the falling enemy, while smiting his head with an axe carried in his right hand. The enemy, whose legs are bent backwards and is about to fall to the ground, is leaning on his left hand and raising his right hand, which seems to touch the end of the long shaft-like object. As noted by scholars, the theme of a warrior wearing a short dress and trampling a fallen enemy was no doubt inspired by Akkadian monuments (cf. Moortgat-Correns</page><page sequence="10">68 TALLAY ORNAN 1952-3, 294; Miglus 2003,405). That the influence of Akkadian imagery continued into eighteenth century Assyria, in particular during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I, is not surprising since the latter associated himself with the rulers of the Old Akkadian dynasty to legitimise his own rule and seems to have followed their imperialistic worldview (Westenholz 2005, 13-14). The adoption of royal Akkadian pictorial themes during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I is thus to be viewed as part of the Old Assyrian emulation of the Akkadian legacy. Although the upper part of the shaft-like object held by the attacker on the Mardin Stela and the upper part of his left forearm have not survived, it can safely be assumed from the upward direction of his arm that he is holding this object. In spite of the fact that the reconstruction of the shaft-like object is hypothetical, its identification may have some bearing on the present discussion. Whereas some scholars identify it as a spear (e.g. Moortgat-Correns 1952-3, 293; Barrelet 1974, 59, 108, Fig. 5; Miglus 2003, 405, Fig. 23), it seems that there is a "bump" at the end of the shaft and a possible cavity within it (cf. Moortgat-Correns 1952-3, Fig. 11). This supports the recon struction offered by B?rker-Kl?hn (1982, No. 111b), according to whom it is a lead rope fastened to the enemy's face by a nose ring. Another difficulty stemming from the partial survival of the Mardin Stela is the identification of the triumphant figure. As his head is also missing, it is not clear whether he represents a male god, recalling the impressions of Shu-iliya from Eshnunna, a deified king like Naram-Sin, or an earthly ruler. A contemporary depiction that may have implications for the identity of the vanquisher on the Mardin Stela is found on the Stela of Dadusha from Eshnunna, which retells the events inscribed on the Mardin Stela from a different angle (Ismail 2003, 130). The relevance of the Dadusha Stela for our discussion is in the unique correlation of text and image; the representation on the upper register of the monument - resembling the scene of the Mardin Stela - is referred to in the text and allows us to identify the trampling figure as Dadusha, king of Eshnunna (Ismail 2003, 148-9; van Koppen 2006, 99, 101-2).17 Hence we may suggest that the scene on the Mardin Stela also depicts a triumphant human king. The latter suggestion finds support in the positioning of the victorious figure at the left of the composition: as on the above noted earlier sculpted reliefs, the deities are shown on the right. Also, the similarity of the dress of the trampling figure on the Mardin Stela to garments worn by non-divine figures on the wall paintings from Mari strengthens the royal identification of the triumphant figure on this monument. In addition, the medallion hung on the chest of this figure parallels similar pendants worn by men shown in the Mari murals, as well as on the human figure facing the king on the Dadusha Stela (Moortgat-Correns 1952-3, 293; Miglus 2003, 402, Figs. 5, 9). If, as suggested, the enemy on the Mardin Stela is fastened to a lead rope by a nose ring and the triumphant figure represents an earthly ruler, we may consider this monument as an Old Assyrian prototype of the later tradition, as depicted on the Broken Obelisk. This tradition replaced the image of the deity holding enemies by a lead rope with that of the king. It seems, however, that the visual positioning of king and deity in triumphal scenes was not yet fixed at the close of the third millennium and in the early second millennium, as exemplified by the seal and impressions of Ana-Sin-taklaku and Mukannishum, servants of Zimri-Lim, from Mari (El-Safadi 1974, 319, Pis. IX:72, X:73; 1975, 434-5; Otto 2000, 154-5). While on the impression of Mukannishum (Fig. 7), the king who tramples the enemies and faces a goddess, appears on the left, on the seal of Ana-Sin-taklaku (Fig. 8) it is the (trampling) god who is depicted on the left (Amiet 1960, 229-31, Figs. 12-13).18 III. Conclusions From the above survey it can be concluded that Mesopotamian representations dated before the late second millennium (with the possible exception of the Mardin Stela) show tethered captives, 17 As the theme on the D?dusha and Mardin Stelae was inspired by Akkadian prototypes such as the divine repre sentations of Naram-Sin, it can theoretically be argued that the figure in question could also stand for a deified ruler. However, as no other secure pictorial depiction of a deified king identified by a horned mitre has been found, other than portrayals of Naram-Sin on the Victory Stela and on the stone mould, this possibility is unlikely. 18 See also the seal of Zardamu, king of Harhar in the Zagros where the trampling king stands on the right (Collon 1982, 168, No. 472).</page><page sequence="11">WHO IS HOLDING THE LEAD ROPE? 69 Fig. 7 The seal impression of Mukannishum, Mari (Amiet 1960, Fig. 12). Fig. 8 The seal impression of Ana-Sin-taklaku, Mari (after El-Safadi 1974, PI. X: 73). at times with nose rings to which were fastened leads held by deities, generally the goddess Ishtar. The idea transmitted by this pictorial theme is that it is the deity who is responsible for the military accomplishments of the king. This visual theme does not, however, parallel written evidence, since in texts preceding the late second millennium one does find the king as the holder of the lead rope, mentioned in Sumerian sources among the royal insignia granted by the gods (CAD 16, S, 136(2); Krecher 1976-80, 111, 113). The scene on the Broken Obelisk showing the king holding the lead ropes thus manifests a shift in the pictorial relationship between the king and the gods regarding who actually controlled the</page><page sequence="12">70 TALLAY ORNAN subdued enemies. Indeed, the gods remain in charge of what happens within the scene, as the emblems representing them are depicted in the upper part of the composition. However, it seems that their involvement, as reflected on the relief, is somewhat limited, in particular in comparison with the earlier Mesopotamian representations of vanquished bound enemies. True, the divine generates the royal achievements and supports them, as metaphorically conveyed by the bow handed down to Ashur-bel-kala by the god Assur, represented by the winged disc. However, the depiction of the gods by their emblems on the Broken Obelisk turns the royal image into the most eye-catching protagonist of the scene (Oman 2005, 56). Moreover, by being rendered through non-anthropomorphic symbols, the deities are no longer physically connected to the subdued enemies and thus it is only the king who controls them with the lead rope. According to the pictorial reading, the victory is transmitted here almost entirely as a royal achievement. In other words, in comparison to third-millennium renderings, the king on the Broken Obelisk takes over a function previously held by a god. The god-like role appropriated by the king on the Broken Obelisk seems to be further enhanced by the depiction of the ropes tied to the king's waist, as this conveys the idea that royal power emanates from the very body of the king. Moreover, the use of the two ropes both tying the captives and winding round the royal image may recall the literary metaphor of the two ropes or cables binding heaven and earth together (serretu and markasu, CAD 16, S, 135(4); 10 M(l), 283(4). As this cosmic double rope could be held by any of several prominent deities, such as Assur, Marduk, Nabu, Adad, Gula and Ninurta (George 1986, 139), one wonders whether the portrayal of Ashur-bel-kala seizing the double rope was not selected in order to promote the king by comparing him to the major deities of Assyria.
