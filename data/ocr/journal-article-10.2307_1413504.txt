XXXVI JANUARY, 1925 No. i THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL WORK OF GRANVTTTLIF STANLEY HALL By SARA CAROLYN FISHER University of California, Southern Branch The beginning and early growth of a differentiated science of psychology in America was the result chiefly of the efforts of three men,-William James, George Trumbull Ladd, and Granville Stanley Hall. Of these, the first two never broke with philosophy. In his Psychology, James' chapter and section heads are for the most part expressive of philosophical topics; and his psychology-brilliant and penetrating though it be-is on the whole a new method of solving epistemological and ethical problems rather than a distinct science. This fact was of enormous importance for making psychology thoroughly re- spectable at the early date at which he wrote. With Ladd, psychology became a more definite branch of study and at- tained a certain body of content largely due to the Wundtian influence under which he wrote and to the specific task he set himself in the title of his text-book-the first of its kind in America and itself a signal service to psychology.l Neverthe- less he returned, after making his psychological contributions, to the philosophical and theological fold "which he had loved long since, and lost awhile." Hall alone made on the other hand a distinct progressive departure from philosophy, which especially in its historical aspects had at one time a great ap- peal to him. Ultimately in his thinking it is philosophy which loses its kingdom at the hands of genetic psychology by falling 'The Elements of Physiological Psychology, 1887. Cf. preface to this first edition.

The obvious opening for the intellectually interested individual of his day-the ministry-became increasingly dis- tasteful, and the first of his two triennia of study in Europe, with the deep draughts of the higher criticism then taken, led to a widening of the breach which completed his unfitness for a theological career, and which also sharpened his dissatisfaction with the New England educational situation.3 His spirit of criticism of prevailing trends, his revolt, and his enthusiasm for European institutions aroused the distrust of the type of college president then common,4 and so served as a handicap in most of the academic openings of the time. These very qualities, however, rendered him peculiarly adapted to such an institution as the newly founded and for psychology very happily timed 2Cf., in Founders of Modern Psychology, 54 f., Hall's comments on Zeller's manner of discussing philosophers, which is the reason for the latter's being included among the "founders." "Sometimes it seems as if he (Zeller) were telling the shades of the old thinkers in the light of modern times what they really meant to say and how and why they came to the views they held. . . The tendency he started will not be complete until we regard the delineation of the ideas of Plato, Schopenhauer, and all between as what the Freudians call the patent content of an underlying vaster and more coherent latent content in which the higher psycho-analysis must find the original determinants of the systems which shaped and moulded and expressed opinions. Sometime the great systems and schools we now revere may be regarded as very much edited and refined types of folk- lore, partial satisfactions of so many kinds of instinctive wishes to believe, psychological documents of attitudes," etc. Cf. also 59, 73, 75, etc. Cf. further Why Kant is Passing, this JOURNAL, 23, 1912, 370-426. The ultimately suicidal nature of this method for genetic psychology-itself an expression of human personality-might be urged. 3Life and Confessions of a Psychologist, Chap. IV.

In 1882 came the opening at the Hopkins, with the opportunity to proceed with the work for which the publishing of the first edition of Wundt's Grungzige in 1874 and Hall's second period in Ger- many spent largely in Leipzig with Wundt and Ludwig, the experimental physiologist, had developed an all-absorbing impulsion. This was the founding at the Hopkins in 1882 of the first psychological laboratory. No more timely or greater service to American psychology is conceivable than this of not only bringing to it the report of European methods and ad- vances, but of transplanting bodily an energetic branch from the central growing trunk of world progress in extension of all phases of human knowledge. The story is a vivid one, and no complete complex feel of the growth of psychology in America is possible without reading in reflective and grateful mood Hall's memoirs and early papers on philosophy and psychology in America.5 Among the influences which led Hall to his activity in experimental psychology was the one which in James constituted the main determinant of his whole psychological contribution,- namely, the possibility it offered for the solution of problems which philosophy had pronounced insoluble or toward the solv- ing of which no methods heretofore open to philosophy had brought satisfactory results. Other influences were, undoubted- ly, his already apparent and growing conviction that the genetic approach, the evolutionary point of view, offered a new world of possibilities for explanation, and his passion for unifying, which together with technological interests was later to lead him to a "higher" reconciliation even with the Apostles' creed-a kind of "practical reason."6 In 1878, in one of his earliest published articles,7 he sounds an energetic warning against the employ- 6Life and Confessions.

Sir William Hamilton and the "intuitive school" of philosophy had pronounced insoluble the problem of space perception. Hall, in the current of the stream of researches started largely by Johannes Miiller and with his work in muscle-physiology in the laboratories of Ludwig and du Bois-Reymond8 hard upon him, advanced the contrary view that the physiological and psychological study of the muscles and their sensations will yield the very basis of space perception and the key to its de- velopment. In developing this theme he assembles the results of many studies which in his mind point strongly to the exist- ence of muscular sensation (at that date not fully established), and at the same time expresses the view that the discovery of the innervation-sense as the ulterior explanation of most or all facts of physiological psychology marks one of the most im- portant epochs in the history of philosophy. The muscular sense is unique in that it alone does not show incommensur- ability between stimulus and sensation,-i. e., actual motion of limbs arouses feeling (variously called by the author 'sense' and 'perception') of motion. Its essential character as motion is not changeable by any subjective or objective analysis; and so it follows that every sensation of motion is itself spatial. The muscle-sense is rudimentary in man; it is the first and most immediate of the senses. It enters into all experiences-is inexpugnable from all sensation-because of the constant flow- ing of nerve energy into the muscle, which thus responds to every variation in sensation; so the thinking self is one and indivisible in the whole organism, instead of the brain alone being the organ of mind. Nothing is spatial in intellect which was not first in sensation. The unknowable is that upon which the individual cannot react (here and elsewhere the article con- tains statements curiously suggestive of many tenets of modern "objective" psychology!). The burden of proof lies upon those who assert that, because space is the logical antecedent of motion, it is superimposed upon non-spatial sensation as an intelligible form of mind. 8Life and Confessions, 209.

The earliest sensation would be a vague area of nerve-muscle substance feeling its own motion as it moved. Here alone (though in a spatial respect only) "subject concurs with, is co-existent with, pervades ob- ject"-here the full solution of the space question lies. This primitive sensation-form is evanescent. Experience and elabor- ation make it a sign of external activity instead of a mere empty form of self-assertion. Psychical life, beginning in muscular substance, retires from muscle to nerve and from nerve-fibre to nerve-cell. Hall also suggests however that, since every prop- erty of nerve is now found in muscle tissue, sensibility in excentric portions does not demand complete neural circulation. Movement explains all things, but must itself be self-known. It is the element of space-perception a priori to perception of the special senses. Its nature enables experimental psychology to challenge the dogmatic dualism of the "scientific school" of metaphysicians. The suggestive, stimulating quality of the writer is apparent, -the vistas of ideas whose attending excitement presses and over-rides questionable analogies and the demands for more minute and critical analysis and reservation of opinion which would give pause to a thinker of the more cautious type. This conviction of the strategic position of the cutaneous and muscular senses, their genetic and therefore explanatory sig- nificance, seems to have furnished a considerable share of the impetus to a number of the Hopkins studies which in turn have played a not inconsiderable r6le in later views in the field o, space perception, especially in the discussion of the question o "local signs." In his inaugural lecture at Baltimore9 Hall further emphasized the importance in experimental psychology of work upon muscular action, of the extension of studies on the reflex, and of the r6le of tactual and visual sensations in throwing light upon the nature and laws of motion. Laboratory analysis of sup- posed indecomposable elements of mind-visual, tactual, audi- tory-have led to clearing and often to solution of philosophical themes. Moreover, Helmholtz' determination of the rate of the 90p. cit., Note 5, p. 3. 5</page><page sequence="6">FISHER nerve-impulse, together with our knowledge of the elements in the "personal equation" (reaction time), enables us to make accurate measurement of the time and hence of the complexity and familiarity of many simpler mental processes, and to determine the effects on them of attention, toxic agents, fatigue, practice, etc.l0 The study of rhythm, periodicities of all kinds, will throw much light upon the consciousness of time, given in philosophy an exceedingly superficial treatment as a form of the sensory. Other promising fields, Hall thought, were being opened in the study of the brain, the determining of the situa- tion of functional centers and the course of fibre-bundles; but he warned against the danger of forgetting, in a confirmed material- ism, the utter incommensurability between the objective re- lations so determined and the closer, more intimate conscious processes. He emphasized also the importance of the study of abnormal states and individuals, and he described and discussed what he regarded as the essential personal qualifications for the student in this field in a fashion which has much of permanent interest and value. Here was virgin territory indeed,-a wealth of vivid ideas, prospects, problems definite and more waiting to be definitized. With all of the loose ends, perilous slashings at Gordian knots, wavering terminology, what a feast nevertheless for the future '?Hall here voiced a current feeling of the great possibilities of the re- action-time experiment in various applications, the results from which however have been rather barren in contrast to the early hopes. Hall him- self had already made a study of the effects of hypnotism upon the reaction time in an ingeniously conceived effort to throw light on the nature of the phenomenon of hypnotism, then a favorite subject for inquiry. He tested the reaction-time in the normal and the hypnotized states of a remarkable hypnotic subject then in town, arguing that, if hypnosis were an attention- phenomenon (a current view which Hall himself favored), then, since the reaction-time is reduced by strong concentration of attention, the subject should react much more rapidly when hypnotized than he was able to do in the normal state. Three hundred and twenty-nine reactions in three successive sittings (after which the subject had to leave the city) showed that the reactions in the hypnotized state were only about 57% as long as those in the normal state, although there was great variation and all re- actions were abnormally slow for this subject. The author also made word- association experiments, and pointed out certain peculiarities in the re- action-words in the hypnotized state. Rather more than half of the article is devoted to interpretations and speculations, many of them suggestive and, as it proved, provocative of a lively discussion.

Hall seems frequently to have encouraged his students to include, in addition to their experimental findings and interpretation, suggestions of further vistas, possible significance of results, and the like. "Alas for the young investigator who does not show signs of thinking or intuiting beyond the data which his method or apparatus sup- plies, for laziness often hides under the guise of scientific re- serve "12 "This list fails to do justice to Hall's full versatility and to the omnivo- rous character of his genius even at this early date. He had previously published a paper on the perception of color in which he offered some experimental evidence which seemed to him to militate against the possi- bility of the existence of red-, green- and blue-sensing cones, and wound up with a suggestion of a mechanical color-theory based upon the sup- position that the cones are composed of transverse discs of progressively varying diameter which vibrate sympathetically with the different wave- lengths of light,-thus, the smaller ones of the tip yielding red. Mechanical agitation of neighboring plates gives after-images. This theory attracted some sympathetic notice at the time (cf. Grant Allen, Mind, 4, 1879, 267- 268), but fell under Wundt's blanket condemnation of mechanical color theo- ries (Grundziige, 2, 1902, 429) and the later set against them. (See Color Perception, Proc. Amer. Acad. of Arts and Sciences, N. S. 5, 1878, 402-413.) Moreover, Hall had made a somewhat incomplete but very useful and suggestive study of Laura Bridgman (Mind, 4, I879, 149-172), investigat- ing her memory, imagery, dreams, use of sound and color words, and her cutaneous and muscular sensitivity. He found her to possess markedly increased tactile sensitivity. No evidence appeared for the existence of any dream content excepting tactual; the same thing was true of her imagery of memory and of imagination. He found decided emotionally expressive movements of her facial musculature, in which fact he saw an argument against Wundt's opinion that facial expression arises in move- ments calculated to modify vision, hearing, smell and taste. This study has been quoted frequently (cf., e. g., Wundt, op. cit., 2, 454. For a modern text cf. C. Griffith, General Introd. to Psychol., 1923, 258). Several papers (including translations) on philosophy were at hand or already published (Outlines of Dr. J. A. Dorner's System of Theology, Presbyterian Quarterly Rev., i and 2; Notes on Hegel and his Critics, Jour. of Spec. Phil., 12, I878, 93-103); the first of his list of books, which included several articles published elsewhere together with a series of impressions gathered in the course of his periods of study in Germany (Aspects of Ger- man Culture, I88I, pp. 320); papers on education and pedagogy (Chairs of Pedagogy in our Higher Institutions of Learning, Bur. of Ed.

Rev., I36, I883, 284-290); and the beginnings of the long line of articles on child-study, based on work done before the Hopkins period (Contents of Children's Minds, Princeton Rev., II, I883; later in Ped. Sem., I, I891, 139-173 and elsewhere; The Study of Children, I883, pp. I3). l2Life and Confessions, 56i. 7</page><page sequence="8">FISHER Hall tells us that, although his title at the Hopkins was "Professor of Psychology and Pedagogy," his chief time and effort were focussed on psychology.13 He also taught the history of philosophy, his goal being "to teach the whole field of the history of philosophy in such a way as to incline my stu- dents to a sympathetic attitude toward all philosophical systems and to make them in turn idealists, pantheists, materialists, associationists, and all the rest to the end that there be no indoctrination or effort at discipleship but that each should choose his own position intelligently and according to his own predisposition, an ideal which I freely expressed and which was never opposed." His students at the Hopkins were an unusually gifted group,-all able, most of them brilliant; and a very high proportion have since achieved eminence. Among them were Donaldson, his assistant in neurology, Jastrow, W. H. Burn- ham, Cattell, Edward Cowles, John Dewey, Hyslop, Noyes, G. T. W. Patrick, and Sanford. Of the thirty-odd books and papers which Hall lists as constituting the production of this group, himself included, during the years from 1883 to I889, three were pedagogical, four philosophical, two in psychology of the abnormal, and at least fifteen (the great majority) in experimental psychology. Among the last-mentioned group were contributions to the fields of cutaneous sensation-in- cluding Donaldson's well-known work on the temperature senses,14 in which he reports their punctiform character inde- pendently discovered at about the same time by Blix and by Goldscheider, and records the negatively resulting efforts to identify the sense-organs by examination of excised bits of punc- tiferous skin. Cattell's famous experiments on association and other reaction times were begun here,15 and Sanford's, on re- action time and on the legibility of small letters.16 The published experimental papers of this period with which Hall's name is directly connected consisted in a series of four which were brought out in Mind and in the early numbers of 1Life and Confessions, 226 ff.

Of these, the first to appear was one undertaken with E. M. Hartwell entitled "Bilateral Asymmetry of Func- tion".17 This was essentially an attack upon the "problem of the relation of right and left handedness to the more general law of bilateral symmetry" of function. Of the seventeen pages of the article ten are devoted to an introductory section in which are briefly stated an enormous number of previous observations or allegations regarding functional, anatomical and pathological asymmetries in the domains of sensation, motor reactions, the nervous system, embryonic development, and perception, wind- ing up with views on the unity or duality of the soul. Exact references and often even the names of authors are absent, and the writers dismiss the whole collection with the statement that not all can be considered final. With a feeling of regret that this critical hint was not amplified into an evaluation of the data in terms of methods or related evidence the reader proceeds to the experimental section. The subjects were chiefly four young men, two right-handed and two left-handed, although control experiments were made upon "many people." None of the numerical results is given, not even averages or probable errors, an omission more excusable at that early date,-but instead the authors formulate conclusions "from tables too extensive to print." The experiments proper fall into five divisions; their methods and conclusions are as follows. (i) Subjectively equal diverging lateral movements of the two arms were measured by recording the distance traversed by the index finger-tips along the edge of a ruler, the subject being blind- folded. The preferred hand made the greater excursion, this rule holding more definitely with movements from the shoulder. The unilateral excess was less with slower or corrected move- ments, when vision was allowed, and when the movements were successive. Individual differences were marked and individual exceptions to main rules fairly common, one observer especially being divergent. (2) A vertical ruler was crossed with a horizontal one so that four quadrants were formed, and up- down movements were introduced with the primary position as a starting point, conditions otherwise being the same as in (i). The preferred hand still made the greater excursion, al- 17Mind, 9, 1884, 93-109. 9</page><page sequence="10">FISHER though gravity, where it figured, was a more important factor and was never completely corrected by the subjects. (3) The writers tested their subjects' accuracy in bringing the two in- dex fingers together in the median plane by means of symmetri- cal movements from the shoulders, eyes being closed, (a) at a point directly in front, (b) one directly over the head, and (c) one low behind the back. An ingenious arrangement employed by Bowditch was used,-two thimbles, the one tipped with a short projecting point and the other with a miniature target in plane transverse to the axis of the thimble, the two equalized in weight. The hits were found to cluster about a center often "rather" remote from the center of the target, which was fairly constant for one person but which bore no apparent relation to handedness. (4) A series of reaction experiments followed. The stimulus was auditory (a falling ball) and one set of reactions was made with the right hand to stimulation of the right ear, another with the converse conditions. The hearing of the two ears was found to be normal and equal in the case of every subject, and five reactions involving one side alternated with an equal number involving the other until many hundred had been secured. Three of the four observers gave slightly though constantly greater reaction-times with the preferred hand, but the fourth gave equally constant shorter times with this hand. The authors believe that the findings with the first three sub- jects, if they prove to be a rule, throw some doubt upon Wundt's identification of apperception with the generation of the motor impulse, which would lead us to expect shorter reactions on the preferred side. (5) Clenching power of the two hands was measured by a simple spring dynamometer. The preferred hand could always exert the more force. Eye-fixation (atten- tion) on one hand always intensified its force, and work of one hand always reduced the simultaneous clenching power of the other. Tests of the ability to duplicate after two sec. a sub- maximal clenching movement indicated subsequent underesti- mation when one hand was employed in the duplicating effort, but the reverse when both were used. The authors are convinced that their results indicate no need for assuming occult (soul) causes for departures from bilateral symmetry. The study of bilateral muscle-tensions, the only IO</page><page sequence="11">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL acts of will, will reveal the key to a common principle for paired organs, and the solution of the problem now seems likely to shed light on the nature of consciousness. They regard their results as in the main tentative, and point out the need of more extended study. They make no attempt to correlate their findings with the lengthy series of observations mentioned in the first section. The following year (I885) saw the appearance of the second paper, "Studies of Rhythm", by Hall and Jastrow.18 A circular brass plate with notched edges in which projecting brass slots could be set at any desired intervals rotated past a projecting sharpened quill so that a snap was produced when a slot struck the point. By setting the slots in the proper notches a known tempo of snaps could be produced. The experiments began with a study of the accuracy of counting rapidly succeeding clicks varying in number from two to sixty-five, the intervals be- tween clicks being .0895 and .0523 sec. Although the observers were highly certain of the accuracy of their count, nevertheless this invariably fell short of the correct number after four to eight snaps had sounded. This result the authors explain by the fact that the number of auditory impressions which can be distinguished in a second is much greater than the number of even the simplest movements which can be produced in the same time. They stress the complexity of the counting process. The second click is at hand before the reaction to the first is quite out of the way, the third click finds the second reaction still less complete, and so on, until a click comes early enough in the reaction to the previous one to be confused with the stimulus to that reaction. Further experiments were concerned with determining just observable differences in interval, with results which are suggestive only for the reasons that they lack adequate statistical treatment and that they are based on too few experiments. Finally, the authors undertook to determine whether the illusion of filled and unfilled space holds likewise for time, and the results were definite and positive for four observers. A year later Hall and Donaldson brought out the results of an extensive series of investigations in a paper entitled "Motor l8Mind, 11, 1886, 55-62. II</page><page sequence="12">FISHER Sensations on the Skin."19 The kinesimeter used by Donald- son,20 with certain well-conceived accessories, provided a piece of apparatus by means of which a button or point could be brought in contact with the skin and moved over its surface at a uniform though variable rate, following skin-contours with- out variation in pressure. The weight and size of the contact- surface could be varied at will, and the direction of movement could be reversed. As to smoothness of control of stimulus thus secured the writers give us no quantitative evidence, and the mechanical principles employed by them are not above re- proach.21 They worked with up and down movements (toward and from the head), reserving study of transverse movements for a later paper. Seven tables of averages (without variations) present the findings, from which the following are the more important conclusions. (I) For all conditions of rate, weight and surface tested, the observers when in doubt judged the movement to be headward. Moreover, a weight too light to produce sensation when the movement was downward often did so when the direction was reversed. For this result the authors suggest a two-fold explanation,-man's greater familiarity with downward movements (rain, sweat, etc.) as compared with the likelihood of noticing upward movement as usually caused by living things, and the fact that upward movement is against the prevailing direction of the hairs. (2) An indeterminate sense of motion sometimes precedes any impression of direction. (3) Judgment of downward motion requires more time than does that of headward motion. (4) Where rate of movement is varied, the judgment is quicker with more rapid rates, but the actual distance covered is fairly constant. This distance is far smaller than the limen of dual impression for the same region of skin, and in the minds of the authors it indicates the existence of smaller motor "sensory circles" within Weber's discriminative circles. (5) When by a special apparatus observers were al- lowed to reproduce rate and distance with the other hand they "Mind, IO, I885, 557-572. 20Op. cit., Note 14, p. 8. Cf. also E. B.

B. Titchener. Cf. this JOURNAL, 6, 1894, 425, and 7, 1895, I50. I2</page><page sequence="13">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL estimated up-movements as longer than objectively equal down- movements. They overestimated relatively long movements and underestimated short ones. (6) With varied rate-the ob- servers still reproducing the movement with the other hand-a given distance was reproduced as shorter when rapidly traversed, though great variation occurred. (7) Marked variation oc- curred in the sensitivity of different parts of the body. (8) Increasing the weight decreases the time needful for a judg- ment, and heavy weights seem to move faster than light ones going at the same rate, indicating in the authors' minds that a summation of extensive or qualitative data affects estimates of rate, and that if there be a simple motor sense in the skin it is not independent of aid from other sources. (9) The authors then undertook a more intensive study of a small area of skin, eliminating variables by shaving and by mapping and avoiding temperature spots. The subjects still judged motion and direction within spaces far less than those needful for distinguishing two points, but warmth and especially cold spots were helpful in fixing locality and in judging motion. Shaving was followed, somewhat to the authors' surprise, by an increase in the difference between the times for 'up' and 'down' judgments. (io) Efforts to investigate further the phenomenon of sense of motion preceding that of direction yielded no re- sults either quantitative or qualitative. (ii) Investigations with an electrode as pressure-point indicated a great complexity and diversity of dermal sensations with uniform movement down the arm, and the rate of movement seemed to vary. (I2) Experiments with extreme rates of motion indicated that with very slow motion (i mm. in o1 to 18 sec.) a weight seemed at rest when it really moved 6 to ii cm.; and, again, it was possible to produce extremely rapid motion of about three inches without the subjects' being able to tell at which end the motion began. The writers conclude "that 'local signs' are quite hetero- geneous, and that, in the strong tendency we have to move the touching dermal surface over objects in contact with it, we are seeking not merely to multiply but to diversify our sensuous data for judging the nature of the impressions and to fill up the dermal 'blind spots' between which impressions are sifted 13</page><page sequence="14">in to us." Various facts indicate "the skin as not only the primeval and most reliable source of our knowledge of the exter- nal world, or the archaeological field of psychology but as a just opening experimental domain of great breadth, where work seems now possible that may compare in both quantity and quality with that accomplished in physiological optics, and which may shed new light on some of the most fundamental problems of psychical action and unfolding." The next year saw the final one of the four studies, a paper by Hall and Motora entitled "Dermal Sensitiveness to Gradual Pressure Changes."22 A weight travelling along a delicately balanced metal beam caused uniform variation in the pressure exerted at the peripheral ends of the beam. Of these, one bore a variable counterweight and the other a stimulus-button which rested on the area of skin employed, the tip of the left fore- finger, which was held in a constant position and could thus be stimulated by any desired initial weight and rate of increment or decrement. The arm was kept at a constant height, to equal- ize blood-pressure, and the subject signalled when he became aware that the weight was increasing or decreasing. The work consisted in one main series of experiments and three less extensive series undertaken with variations of the principal method. (i) Six tables of averages of twenty experi- ments each for six observers present the numerical results of the main experiment,-the authors stating that "as the experi- ments progressed the two chief causes of variation, viz., chang- ing degrees of attention and of certainty, steadily diminished." Erroneous judgments were so rare as to be negligible. The first table shows the time in seconds of the judgments with uniform rate of increment and initial weights of 5, Io, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, Ioo, 200 and 500 gms. Five of the six ob- servers gave slower judgments with the lighter and heavier initial weights. Of these, three showed fairly definite optimal initial weights of 70, 8o, and ioo gms. respectively, while with the other two the time of judgment did not decrease in suffi- ciently progressive fashion to permit of a reliable inference as to optima. The sixth subject-a highly trained cabinet maker -showed far greater rapidity of judgment than did any other subject, judgments of the five-gm. weight being most rapid of 2This JOURNAL, I, I887, 72-98. 14 FISHER</page><page sequence="15">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL all. The second table shows the effect of varying the rate of increment, with an initial weight of fifty gms. chosen as a result of the above-mentioned findings. More or less regularly pro- gressive increase in the time of judgment appeared with de- crease in rate of increment. Four following tables give the findings of the above two ex- pressed in terms of gms. added or subtracted before difference was perceived (three and five) and the ratios of these numbers to the initial weights (four and six). The writers believe that their results indicate a relation very inaccurately approaching the constancy expressed by Weber's law,-a relation which is inexact, appears only within limits, and is subject to wide individual variations. The results indicate far lesser sensibility to growing differ- ences in pressure than to differences in weights successively ap- plied. The writers discuss possible sources of error in the elasticity of the skin, change in area depressed as weight in- creases, and local anaemia with prolonged stimuli, but do not consider these as sufficient materially to affect sensitivity; it would require other methods to produce a change sufficient to crush or harm tissue without the subject being aware of it, after the analogy of frogs killed without struggle by increasing temperatures when the change is sufficiently gradual. The writers go into the question of the nature of the con- scious processes involved in the judgments which their method elicited. The observers did not experience continuity of change, either quantitative or qualitative, but instead attention singled out a degree of pressure and compared it with a remembered earlier degree. Decision was difficult and slow as compared with that present in successive weight estimation, because of lack of in- tervals for rest of terminal organs with consequent increase in their sensitivity, and because three instead of two factors must be held in mind, namely, initial pressure, possibility of increase, and possibility of decrease. Hence no inferences from the work of Weber and Fechner can be applied to the present experiment. (2) In a second less extensive series of experiments the authors used initial weights of 1000, 500, 250, and 125 gms. These were increased or reduced by known amounts, and in some cases allowed to remain stationary. Three subjects gave fifteen I5</page><page sequence="16">judgments each with increasing, decreasing, or unchanging stimuli and the corresponding three categories of judgment. A table of averages is given from which it appears to require much more time to perceive a stationary or a decreasing stimulus than an increasing one. Moreover, many errors of overestima- tion occurred, stationary stimuli being judged as increasing, and decreasing ones as stationary. This finding the authors explain in part by fatigue and expulsion of blood due to heavi- ness of weights. (3) Sensitivity to negative pressures (pulls) was studied in the next two series. Adhesive plaster was fastened to the stim- ulus button, so that this stuck to the contact-finger. Ten pairs of alternate just detectable pressures and pulls were given and the results were averaged. The point of subjective neutrality or the apparent tactile zero-a point well marked for con- sciousness-was, curiously enough, somewhat more negative (on the pulling side) than the point of actual neutrality. The authors believe this to be a kind of mental compensation for the fact that in common tactile experience some pressure is practically always present. (4) In the final series, the apparatus was set at the apparent tactile zero and varied in a positive or negative direction until the observer recognized either pres- sure or pull. The sensations for a time proved to be surpris- ingly indistinguishable; for a moment the change might appear to be plus, then minus, in a fashion suggestive of binocular rivalry. After this latter analogy the authors called the phe- nomenon antinomous dermal rivalry, and explained it in part by pressures at the edges of the finger occasioned by the pull from the central portion.23 Relative to the minimal stimuli required for tactile sensitivity, enormous weights had to be added or corresponding pulls exerted in order to elicit certain judgment. With slow rate of change, a much smaller degree of difference is correctly recognized. The region on the scale of pressure stimuli here concerned is one, the authors state, regard- ing whose effects practically nothing is known; it lies outside of the range of validity of the psychophysical law, and needs careful further investigation. 23A similar finding is reported in a recent paper.

The studies show great vigor and fertility of idea and resource. Ingenious apparatus was devised and adapted. Finished in some respects, in many they bear the stamp of the pioneer study. In them the literature was worked over for the striking and suggestive observation rather than for purposes of evaluation and orientation. They reveal striking trends, but methods employed were inadequate for the discovery of definite laws. They teem with hidden complexities and unex- pected findings which await more complete description and de- termination of conditions. Further analysis has made highly probable the complex character of the consciousness of motion and other mental phenomena which Hall was inclined at the time to view as elementary. The studies in question did much to map out the field and to prepare it for the investigator with more intensive attack. They have attracted no little attention in connection with contemporary and later handling of the problems of tactual space perception, especially the discussions of the local sign, and the factors which affect the limen. Ladd among others presents in great detail the results of Hall and Donaldson relative to motor sensations on the skin, using them to support his view of the complex character of the local sign.24 James mentions the same findings in the same connection.25 Wundt refers in a footnote to Hall and Motora's findings as to the influence of rate of increment upon the difference limen for pressure.26 What the subsequent history of the Hopkins laboratory would have been, had Hall continued his work there, we can only conjecture. In later courses on the feelings which he gave at Clark University he stressed the same fundamental driving idea that was influential in promoting the Hopkins studies,-namely, touch as the mother of, the genetic key to, all sensation and feeling; and he had at this time the unrealized hope of producing some day a large treatise on the feelings. Many things indicate, however, that the more methodical 4Elements of Physiological Psychology, 4II; I91I ed. with Woodworth, 404 ff. '2Principles of Psychology, 2, I890, I55. Cf. also 281. 26Grundzige, I, I902, 537. I7</page><page sequence="18">FISHER studies would have been made by others. Hall's interest in child study and its application was well over the horizon. In a paper published in i89427 the "practical reason" and the peda- gogical point of view are well under way; the method of teach- ing philosophy stressed at the Hopkins in somewhat diluted with a view to the need of immature minds; and regret is ex- pressed that some of the (then) "new" psychologists go no further, but are content only to make methods more exact and results more refined. But in addition to the laboratory and to the experimental contributions, one other outstanding service to psychology marks Hall's period at the Johns Hopkins University,-the founding in 1887 of this JOURNAL, concerning which Hall's own story is as follows.28 "Toward the latter part of my stay here I had a memorable call one Sunday from J. Pearsall Smith of Philadelphia, an entire stranger to me who had learned some- thing of the Hopkins work in psychology. He suggested that I found a journal and then and there gave me a check for five hundred dollars 'as a starter.' I had long desired to do this and President Gilman favored it, for the establishment of depart- mental journals was one of the prominent items in the program of the Johns Hopkins, so that at last, with great trepidation, I printed and circulated a prospectus, gathered material, and issued the first number, printing if I am not mistaken, the enormously excessive number of 3,000 copies and finding, when this number was distributed, that the bills for it alone footed up to seventeen hundred dollars. There were few sub- scribers and the deficit had to be made up from my own savings. I may add that at one time it had cost me eight thou- sand dollars more than it had brought in, and although we were not able, after we entered the war, to publish the six hundred pages a year planned, it is now in its thirty-second volume (I92I) and brings a modest profit-all without advertising itself or anything else. It was also very difficult to find good material. As the earlier volumes show, most of the small-type part of it, a half or more, which was devoted to reviews, was "The New Psychology as a Basis of Education, Forum, 17, I894, 7Io- 720. 28Life and Confessions, 227 f. i8</page><page sequence="19">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL written by myself. I read voraciously and epitomized over a wide field. . .. I sought to give the Journal wide scope, including the most salient tendencies in religious philosophy, logic, aesthetics, the significant work in the domain of psy- chiatry, child study, anthropology, etc." Pearsall Smith, whose chief interest was in psychical research, gave up even his subscription when the JOURNAL criticised this movement. The experimental papers of the Johns Hopkins period mark Hall's last contributions to experimental psychology; after the long break in the stream of his psychological productivity oc- casioned by the founding of Clark University and the harassing administrative difficulties which absorbed his time he returned to quite a different type of psychological activity. The story of the early days of Clark University, the bright promise of op- portunity for a second and even better Johns Hopkins which alone tempted him to leave his work, the long unhappy struggle owing to withholding of expected funds, the enforced reduction of departments, the reluctant compromises, constitute the material of a long chapter in the Life and Confessions and, we are told, the chief motive to its publication. During these years Hall managed to give many lectures dealing with educational topics and applications of psychology and to put out a stream of articles for the most part of similar character, but inter- spersed with an occasional historical essay and with numerous book reviews and notes. And most important of all, he suc- ceeded in salvaging in addition to sufficient material means for limited university activity the all-important spiritual endow- ment of a university,-an atmosphere of entire freedom, a tradition of the supreme importance of contribution however small to the sum-total of human knowledge, and a variety of methods and points of view which provided untold intellectual stimulation through discussion and criticism. However much Hall grew in the direction of impatience with the slow and to him often insignificant progress of the laboratory worker, nevertheless the facilities for laboratory research never suffered at his hands, and the individual workers themselves often felt in Hall the administrator a pride in, and encouragement of, their work "patently" denied by Hall the geneticist. I9</page><page sequence="20">FISHER During the early Clark period occurred the founding of the American Psychological Association. Hall, in conference with Ladd and others, planned a society of psychologists, and on July 8th, 1892, a group of more than twenty met at Clark Uni- versity. The Association was formed as a result of this meeting, with Hall as the first president, and Jastrow as the secretary- treasurer. Three months before his death Hall was elected president for the second time,-the only individual with the exception of James to receive this honor. In 1893 Hall resumed university teaching at Clark, Dr. E. C. Sanford having in the meantime taken over the laboratory. Dur- ing the years immediately preceding, the tasks which he had un- dertaken had accentuated his interest in the needs of the student and in the function of the university and the school system. This practical interest and the interest in genetic psychology and child study--well established long before he left the Johns Hopkins-now assumed the dominant position in Hall's activity. The long series of questionary studies of the middle and later nineties resulted, and the outcome shows in the series of four volumes which Hall published during the years I904 to 91I--- the large two-volume Adolescence, the abridgement of this in Youth, the Aspects of Child Life and Education, and Educational Problems, the two-volume companion of Adolescence. Here are presented vast compendia embracing the great bulk of the findings, conclusions and beliefs of the whole civilized world on the subjects treated or those bearing on them, collected during many preceding years for university lectures. Generously incorporated are the yieldings of questionary studies which began to appear in 1895. Permeating the whole and furnishing the main source of whatever the books possess by way of organization and system is the author's conviction that the understanding of the present is possible only in the light of the whole evolutionary process, a conviction which led to, and was in turn reinforced by, a lecture course on animal and primi- tive human life, instincts and habits. Two articles constitute the only offshoots of this course in psychological literature,29 29A Glance at the Phyletic Background of Genetic Psychology, this JOURNAL, 19, 1908, 149-2I2; and What we Owe to the Tree-Life of our Ape-like Ancestors, Ped. Sem., 23, 1916, 94-119. 20</page><page sequence="21">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL for the reason that Hall regarded it as valuable principally in connection with pedagogy. "No course I have ever given sent so many of my students to the library or, I think, contributed quite so much to give them a general and wholesome conception of man's place in nature."30 It began with views of the lifeless earth and theories of the origin of life in the world, and followed the progress of life from pre-protozoic forms up to historic times. All of Hall's later interests were definitely foreshadowed in the above activities. Hall is most widely known as a psychologist, and it is thus that he commonly styles himself. Inasmuch as his other activities have to a great extent emanated from and depended upon the psychology of his mature years, it is this which de- mands the greatest emphasis in any consideration of his in- tellectual contribution. Closely associated with his psychology at every hand is his educational teaching. "The largest possible aspect of all the facts of life and mind is educational and the only complete history is the story of the influences that have advanced or retarded the development of man toward his completion. . . Thus psychology and the higher pedagogy are one and inseparable."31 Owing to this peculiar connection which Hall makes between his psychology and its application, the temper of his work would be in a measure lost by attempting too separate a consideration of the two. What, then, is Hall's psychology, and how does it "work" in its most immediate applications? In the introduction to Adolescence, which Hall tells us is essentially his first book, we are informed that the work is based upon the author's psychology, which should logically have been published first. The sections to which we are mainly referred for the psychology are entitled "Feelings and Psychic Evolution." Hall's projected work on sensation and feeling, which would probably have been the Psychology to which he referred, never appeared; so for the psychology of his mature and most productive period we must look chiefly to Adolescence and its-in large measure-companion and supplementary work, Educational Problems. For the rounding-out of his 30Cf. the description of this course in Life and Confessions, 363 ff. 31Adolescence, ix. 21I</page><page sequence="22">FISHER psychology and its educational and social bearings we must turn to Senescence (I922), which in a very real sense is a continua- tion of the trend established in the other two works. The ob- ject of the chapter which in the main presents this psychology is "to state in a brief and summary way . . . the general conceptions of the soul" that underlie his theme. We find that Hall's psychology consists essentially in a basic law which constitutes the major premise of his whole thinking, a method of inference suggested by this law, and a body of facts accumulated from the literature and from questionary studies and interpreted in the light of this law. The fundamental law, which Hall calls a "general psycho- nomic law", is an adaptation to the mental sphere of the con- cepts of biological evolution and the dependent doctrine of physical recapitulation, developed largely by Haeckel and Herbert Spencer. It assumes that the psychical life and its expressions in the individual develop from birth onward through a series of stages more or less closely corresponding to successive cycles of habits through which life and especially early man and his immediate ancestors are conceived to have passed. "As soon as I first heard it in my youth I think I must have been hypno- tized by the word 'evolution', which was music to my ear and seemed to fit my mouth better than any other .... I think my curiosity somehow got an early tilt toward origins, and even in college (1863-1867) I brought much censure upon myself by advocating the view that man had sprung from ape-hood. . For my German teacher, Trendelenburg, Werden or be- coming was the prime category and the mother of all others, and this helped to predispose me to accept all I could under- stand of the Hegelian logic, in which all innate ideas evolve by an inner necessity from those that precede, by his three steps- thesis, antithesis, synthesis. . . Schelling's system ranked next because it treated all organic and even inorganic nature as steps in the unfoldment of a mighty process . . . Thus there was a kind of mystic, poetic stage of prelusion by which Dar- win, Huxley, Spencer, Haeckel and even Tyndall were, it seemed to me, prepared for in my philosophic history, and when these loomed large upon my horizon they were devoured with the utmost avidity. ... To conceive the whole world, 22</page><page sequence="23">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL material and spiritual, as an organic unity, to eliminate all breaks and supernaturalism, and to realize that everything within and without was hoary with age, so that in most ex- periences we are dealing only with the topmost twigs of vast but deeply buried trees, gave me a totally new aspect of life. . . . I was bat-eyed to difficulties and impatient at objec- tions, and had a blind spot in my mind for every break in the developmental order and implicit faith that if there anywhere seemed to be gaps it was only because we lacked adequate knowledge. . . . I was once introduced to an audience by an overzealous friend as the Darwin of the mind, and extrava- gant and absurd as I knew this to be, it gave me more inner satisfaction than any compliment ever paid me by the most perfervid friend."32 The above quotations explain much of the spirit with which Hall writes of his fundamental "general psychonomic law which assumes that we are influenced in our deeper more temperamental dispositions by the life-habits and codes of conduct of we know not what unnumbered hosts of ancestors, which like a cloud of witnesses are present throughout our lives, and that our souls are echo-chambers in which their whispers reverberate".33 "Our soul is full in all its parts of faint hints, rudimentary specters flitting for an instant at some moment of our individual life and then gone forever, dim and scarcely audible murmurs of a great and prolonged life, hot, intense, richly dight with inci- dent and detail that is no more; a slight automatism, perhaps, being the sole relic of the most central experiences of many generations, a fleeting fancy all that survives of ages of toil and blood, a feeling that only peeps out for a moment in infancy, the far-off dying echo of what was once the voice of a great multi- tude. Yet these psychophores, whatever they are, are wax to receive and marble to retain." They are "somehow represented in the lower . . brain levels, the sequence up the cord, medulla, basal ganglia, cerebellum being a better picture of the real evolution of mind when we can read its meaning aright than the chambered nautilus gives us of its stages of growth."34 32Life and Confessions, 357ff.

The chief of these consists in the vastness of the "collective soul," which is co-extensive with life. Much soul is lost; for whenever a species became extinct, a soul-type vanished. Every animal group may represent some one quality specialized and promoting the survival of that species. The human soul is one of many types. The con- scious adult does not reflect the universe, but he is rather a fragment detached from the great world of soul, "well fitted to illustrate some aspects and hopelessly unable to exemplify or know other regions in the cosmos of soul. In him many dif- ferent traits thus may contend for expression, this conflict being particularly likely to occur in offspring of different racial stocks. Layers successively acquired may be reversed in their appear- ance in the individual, while recent salient occurrences often appear to sink into fathomless oblivion, and very ancient tendencies may push up even into consciousness." Certain functions, notably sex, are variable up and down the scale. Large brain, acquired late in the phylum, is early in the individ- ual. Thus the individual often distorts the racial order.35 According to Hall the normal growth of the individual mind necessitates the living-through of each stage, because the de- velopment of any one stage is the normal stimulus to the de- velopment of the succeeding stage. This principle is the guid- ing thread to his whole doctrine of education, although its application frequently has to be tempered in the interests of practical modern demands. Environmental factors, however, may cause the appearance of reactions before their normal time; this produces undesirable precocity. The result is the over-studious child, or the child otherwise prematurely habit- uated to adult ways. Perversions of certain kinds and ac- centuation of, e. g., sex before the later rational processes which it should accompany may thus ensue. Moreover, certain normally earlier stages thus crowded out instead of being lived may emerge later as criminal tendencies, which are essentially misplaced reversions to lower savage strata. 36Adolescence, Chap. X., esp. 68. Educational Problems, I, 20If. 24</page><page sequence="25">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL Such is Hall's fundamental law. In his mind it has certain bearings upon the present and future status of man. Despite elements of civilization that interfere with growth, "I am an optimist root and core, not merely because an evolutionist must hold that the best and not the worst will survive and prevail, but because in most though not yet in all of these fields I see clearly the beginnings of better things."36 "Tentative as is now our knowledge, it is sufficient to generate a deep hope that man is yet in the making, that the best things have not yet happened in his history and that perhaps his present stage is at the same time the point of departure of a yet higher one related to all that adolescence now gives, as it is to the stages that preceded. Assuming the bionomic law, infant growth means being loaded with paleo-atavistic qualities in a manner more conformable to Weismannism, embryonic growth being yet purer, while the pubescent increment is relatively neo-atavistic. From this it would seem to follow that the more complete and established the maturity before offspring are produced, the greater the probability of phyletic progress in successive generations."37 Hall's central law immediately raises many problems, and suggests a programme. The child and the race are each a key to the other. "We shall never truly know ourselves till we know the mind of animals, and most especially those in our line of descent. We must recognize that some of them are our superiors in certain respects; that while we explain them by explication of those traits wherein we excel, they no whit less explain us by those of their traits which are superior to ours and of which our souls contain only relics; that if in general we are their realized entelechy, they are the key by which alone we can unlock many of the mysteries of our own origin and nature." "We must collect states of mind, sentiments, phenomena long since lapsed, psychic facts that appear faintly and perhaps but once in a lifetime, and that only in few and rare individuals, impulses that it may be never anywhere arise above the thresh- old, but manifest themselves only in automatisms, acts, be- havior, things neglected, trivial and incidental, such as Darwin 36Adolescence, i, xviii. 37Ibid., 50. 25</page><page sequence="26">FISHER says are often most vital. We must go to school to the folk- soul, learn of criminals and defectives, animals, and in some sense go back to Aristotle in rebasing psychology on biology, and realize that we know the soul best when we can best write its history in the world, and that there are no finalities save formulae of development."38 Consequently the method must be objective, carefully observational; and the "genetic" psychologist, while he must use introspection in the old way, or reinforced and perfected by experimental methods wherever they serve his purpose, will find it necessary, almost in exact proportion as his work becomes fundamental, to gather his data empirically from the comparative study of lower forms of life and of children and from the collation of many minds be- side his own.39 With this programme in mind, Hall chose the questionary method, supplementing the returns obtained by many students and by himself with the results of innumerable statistical and other studies and recorded observations obtained in the course of his amazingly extensive reading. The results of these aims and methods in Hall's hands, to- gether with their educational applications, compose the bulk of the four volumes of Adolescence and Educational Problems, and in a great measure of Senescence as well.40 Hall never evolved more than the barest rudiments of a system of psychology in the ordinary sense; though he makes frequent use of general psy- chological concepts, he is at no great pains to define or to inter- relate them, frequently indeed declaring definition impossible.4 His impatience with classification was apparently a reaction from the to him hampering classifications of current philoso- phical or semi-philosophical systems. "The same revolution in the studies that deal with the soul impends that von Baer and Darwin represented for the body. Before their day, everything was classification, nomenclature, fixed species, just as with the pregenetic psychologists everything was faculties and processes, analyses and categories, as if the adult human mind as we know 38Ibid., 2, 62; I, vii f. 9gIbid., 2, 62. 4?Adolescence, 1904, I373 pp.; Educational Problems, I9II, I425 pp.; Senescence: The Last Half of Life, I922, 5I8 pp.3 4Cf.

The terms "soul" and "mind" appear at times to have a slightly different connotation for Hall. "Most summarily, the idea of soul we hold to is in its lower stages indistinguishable from that of life, and so far in a sense we revert to Aristotle in holding that any truly scientific psychology must be first of all biological. Mind is almost, possibly quite, co-extensive with life, at least animal life "(italics not in text). A bit later, we have: "Mind and life are one and inseparable."" The terms are employed almost interchangeably, and if there is any difference it would seem to consist in a slight tendency to identify "mind" with the more plastic and adaptive ("intellectual") phenomena and "soul" with the more ancient, fixed life of instinct and feeling. We find a thoroughgoing dualism and interchangeable causality; Hall did not realize the monism adumbrated in his early paper on the Muscular Perception of Space (cf. Note 7, p. 3). The soul reflects the growth not of the brain alone, but of every part or organ. It is as profoundly sexed as the body.4 There are as many types of mind as of body, and we can truly know soul only through body, and conversely. "A brain without mind is as impossible as a mind without brain, every normal and pathological change in either affecting the other."45 In the light of the foregoing, the author's frequent references to "collective soul" and "mind continuous with life", related probably to his pantheistic leanings, are either figurative or purely mystical. Much the same thing is true of "man-soul," a term which appears with slightly increas- ing frequency through the series of his books and articles and goes through a kind of imperfectly progressive evolution *Adolescence, 2, 62. 43Ibid., 63. Cf. also op. cit., Note 29, this JOURNAL, 200: "For one, I prefer to defy the current horror of anthropomorphism and to show a decent respect to continuity. Only to speculative and monoideistic minds can the question between some psychic rudiment and tropism be so put that we must cleave to the one and despise the other answer, for both are at the same time true and both are involved in the same reactions."

Various divisions or processes of the "soul" or "mind" are designated and more or less clearly differentiated. Most stressed is that department which is composed of "feelings," "instincts," "feeling-instincts," "instinct-feelings," "senti- ments." We are given little by way of distinction of these terms, -in fact, Hall has asserted vigorously that the feelings cannot be defined, and the best course with regard to them is to confess our ignorance (op. cit., Note 41, p. 26). He regards the James- Lange theory as really only a philosophical speculation, entirely beyond the present reach of scientific investigation.46 Hall is more interested in accounting for them, however. The feeling- instincts are "the deeper, older and more fixed unary or binary or at most ternary compounds that were matured and compacted before man arose." They are, e. g., "the aggressiveness and cruelty of the carnivora, and the timidity and deceit of creatures long preyed upon." "Hunger, love, pride, and many other instinctive feelings, to say nothing of pleasure and pain, can be traced far down through the scale of vertebrate and to inverte- brate life".47 Belonging to this group are "the many-voiced comments, the sense of assent and dissent, . . . the illa- tion of strength or the esthetic responses, the play of intuitions, the impulses to do or not to do, automatic tensions or contrac- tions."48 The feelings cannot be well remembered, or indeed they are entirely forgotten, because they are blind and incon- sistent, lacking the intellectual factor of experience.49 The feeling-instincts are assumed to be the psychophores or "bearers of mental heredity," some of which persist below the threshold of consciousness throughout our lives, while others "affect conduct as if striving to be relived and competing for the focus of attention or perhaps leading a submerged life in nearly faded automatisms."50 These feeling-instincts may be "made over as instincts," or they may be "transformed into habits." The phrases are obscure, and the reader finds little to aid him in 46Life and Confessions, 430. 47Adolescence, 2, 60 f. 48Ibid., 67. 49Ibid., 73, 91. 6Ilbid., 68. 28</page><page sequence="29">GRANVILLE STALNEY HALL an investigation of Hall's use of the term "instinct;" the word is employed in many connections, in a fashion literary rather than scientific, and even rarely in a manner which would seem to indicate that it does not imply heredity. Thus, in connection with childish fugues, he refers to "the instinct to follow a man or a vehicle. . When this truant instinct is strong and hereditary, as is often the case, . . the impulse . . may be irresistible and almost epileptic" (italics not in text).5 Again, "such children often have a weak instinct for property." Young men may be dominated by "conservative or radical instincts."52 "Subordination of each member to the whole and to a leader cultivates the social and co-operative instincts."53 Of condemned juveniles, "472 lied from instinct and weak- ness."4 An autobiographic instinct even is mentioned.56 In addition to the instinctive or feeling side of mind and soul, Hall has much to say about the conscious side, or con- sciousness, in spite of the calamitous possibilities which he thinks arise from the introduction of this term.56 The occur- rence of consciousness is favored by relatively quiescent inter- vals; it tends not to develop in periods of ferment and rapid change. Two main types of consciousness seem to exist for Hall,-a kind of surveillant consciousness or "enjoyment" of phenomena, and an adaptive consciousness, similar to that recognized by certain of the "functional" psychologists, e. g., by Angell. The first type exists in a crude form in childhood. "The unconsciousness of the normal child makes it, though naked, not ashamed . . . Its consciousness is in this respect not unlike that of animals."57 "The consciousness of childhood is molted, and a new, larger, better consciousness must be developed."58 In the adult mind this type of conscious- ness is very limited, fragmentary, presentative of only the top- most twigs of the deeply buried tree of the soul or like a tiny flickering flame in a vast dark museum filled with the bones and fossils of ancient life.

"Highest, narrowest, most apical, and mobile as a tongue is the affective state of the present flitting moment, related to general personal mind as little as it is to the impersonal phyletic, or as it again to general soul."60 Some intimation there is that consciousness might penetrate further, but how we are not told: "Each has, at least ideally, a capacity to comprehend much if not most of the experience of the race from the be- ginning, but this experience is dormant in us unless brought out by objective life or observation."6' The second type, the organizing and adaptive consciousness, arose late in the species and appears correspondingly late in the life of the individual. It appears to play a dual r6le. At times Hall views it as abnormal, a little disreputable. "We cannot believe that consciousness is even quite the efflorescence of the human plant. It may be a wart raised by the sting of sin, a product of alienation or a remedial process. . . Conscious- ness seems in some of its aspects more likely a fall or a process of purgation so far as it is merely adaptive." "Our conscious- ness is but a single stage and one type of mind: a late, partial, and perhaps essentially abnormal and remedial outcrop of the great underlying life of man-soul."62 Feeling may after all do the work of this consciousness: "Feeling may be de-specializa- tion, dissolution, and preliminary to evolution along new lines" ;6 and women and soldiers at least should have none of it. "She (woman) works by intuition and feeling . . . If she abandons her natural naivet6 and takes up the burden of guid- ing and accounting for her life by consciousness, she is likely to lose more than she gains, according to the old saw that she who deliberates is lost."" "Conscience is the very acme of self- consciousness. It involves deliberation and excludes most of those energies of the soul that are bewusstseinsunfahig or which cannot get into the narrow field of consciousness.

Hence comes casuistry and every kind of perversion, e. g., the conscientious objector."65 But on the other hand the adaptive form of consciousness is an organizing and developing agent performing an exceedingly important function for the successful adjustment of the individual. If the larger, better conscious- ness is not developed, increased exposure and vulnerability will bring deterioration. "From the oldest trophic and vaso-motor functions and organs mediating pleasure and pain and perhaps other fundamental feeling-instincts, up the complex hierarchy of powers when the projection system itself slowly comes under some, perhaps tangential, organ of thought, and during adoles- cence when a suddenly widened area of life is governed and perhaps reconstructed by intelligence, this viaticum is easily and rapidly passed in normal psychogenesis, but for the full understanding of it the entire animal series . . . is none too large a basis. Conscious thought, noetics, intellect, reason, are popular and provisional terms for the last or neopsychic stages in this process, and all their higher forms are probably rarer and developed later in the average human being than is usually held."66 Hall does not tell us what processes constitute the adaptive consciousness, but from such passages as the above and from the similarity of functions ascribed it is highly probable that these are the higher intellectual activities of reasoning and judgment, owing their character to the associative as opposed to the merely projicient apparatus. "In all this flux and chaos (jostling of barbaric and animal traits), however, common sense, that knows and adjusts to facts and to the external world, and the sciences of nature are the two solidest of all foundations and are represented by the solidest and most firmly woven brain texture; if man can ever bring order into the rest of his confused psychic life it must be by going back to these and working out and upward from them by observational methods in the inner as well as the outer world."67 And it is precisely this function that is glorified in old age and constitutes its supreme ideal contribution .68 aMorale, 3. 66Adolescence, 2, 450. 67Ibid., 69. 68Senescence, Chap. 8. 31</page><page sequence="32">FISHER Further efforts to work out Hall's criteria of mind and of consciousness afid to line them up with various conceptions of the nature of consciousness-or perhaps any such efforts at all- are superfluous, so little was he concerned with matters of system. He makes occasional and more or less fleeting use of all or most of these conceptions. Neither did Hall have the slight- est interest in working out a consistent envisagement and arrangement of the simpler and more complex processes of consciousness. He recognizes a kind of progression: "Sensation, perception and understanding represent roughly the various degrees of appropriation of apperception, the whole process of which is too integral to be partitioned."69 The processes of childhood are those bound up with the projicient system,-the senses, activities, with rudimentary consciousness and practi- cally no reasoning. Space and time are immediate realities bound up with touch and movement, and reality itself is an immediate datum of touch. Whether the senses in childhood belong to "intellect" or to feeling is uncertain, especially in the case of touch, under which Hall considers pain, a word which (after the older terminology) usually means for him the opposite of pleasure. Had he been interested in the issue, his reference of the senses back into a time far antedating the growth of consciousness in the adaptive sense at least might have led him to classify them as feelings, certainly as something not be- longing to this consciousness. He does indeed-in common with other genetic writers-consider touch as a kind of primitive experience bearing the rudiments both of feeling and of the later "higher" senses. The organizing and synthetizing func- tions of intelligence are on the contrary late; and old age, if it realizes its complete destiny, elaborates these. Early and late adolescence and middle life are characterized by the progressive ordering of the riot of the feelings. In the course of his writings Hall has much to say about imagination, and makes not infrequent references to ideational types,-"eye-mindedness," etc.,-which he thinks explain in a measure certain types of human activity. His attempts to assign imagination to a certain age and period are not completely successful, and its position with relation to the texture of pro- 69Why Kant is Passing, this JOURNAL, 23, I9I2, 372. 32</page><page sequence="33">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL cesses on the main line of development seems somewhat external. "Cloud forms have almost created the imagination."70 "It is often a well-marked epoch when the young child first learns that it can imagine and state things that have no objective counterpart in its life, and there is often a weird intoxication when some absurd and monstrous statement is made, while the first sensation of a deliberate break with truth causes a real excitement which is often the birth pang of the imagination. More commonly this is seen in childish play, which owes a part of its charm to self-deception. Children make believe they are animals, doctors, ogres, play school, that they are dead, mimic all they see and hear. Idealizing temperaments sometimes prompt children of three or four to suddenly assert that they saw a pig with five ears, apples on a cherry tree, and other Munchausen wonders, which really means that they have had a mental combination independently of experience. Sometimes their fancy is almost visualization and develops into a kind of mythopeic faculty which spins clever yarns and suggests in a sense, .... that all their life is imagination."71 "Puberty is the birthday of the imagination. This has its morning twi- light in reverie, and if brilliant and vivid, supplements every limitation, makes the feeble athletic, the beggar rich, knows no limitations of time or place, and is, in a word, the totalizing faculty. In its world all wishes are actualized, and hundreds of our returns, elsewhere reported, show that in many sane chil- dren, their own surroundings not only shrivel but become dim and shadowy compared with the realm of fancy . . . The ingenuous youth sees visions or dreams somewhat according as he is ear- or eye-minded. The optical centers are especially sensitized to new harmonies of form and especially color .. Thought and the two higher senses are never so vivid and in- tense because they are just ready to bifurcate, each to lead its own life, so that the two are now peculiarly liable to be confused, intellectual processes to take sense forms, and vice versa. It is for this reason that hallucinations, false sight and especially hearing, is most common."72 Hall relates sensory types (whether ideational or perceptual is not always clear) to philosophical Anlagen: "The eye-minded man is perhaps more disposed to 70Adolescence, 2, 69. 71bid., I, 350. 72Ibid., 313f. 33</page><page sequence="34">idealism than the practical motor-minded type. The blind have the most unfaltering sense of the reality of the external world because they are nearer the original tangible form in which reality was first given."73 But apparently "thought" is something of more dignity than and of different stuff from imagination: school youth suffer because of over-stress of the concrete, with insufficient emphasis upon "the higher and more mental associations of likeness," relatively removed from activ- ity, as opposed to "thinking", that is, "mere contiguity in space or sequence in time." "If their psychic operations can be called thought it is of that elementary and half animal kind that consists in imagery." "They lack even the elements of imagina- tion which makes new combinations and is creative because they are dominated by mental pictures of the sensory".74 Turning now from Hall's fundamental psychological doc- trines and "apercus" to a consideration of their results in his hands,-chiefly found in the bulk of the treatment of Adoles- cence, Educational Problems and in considerable measure in Senescence,-we note that in addition to statistical studies they consist for the most part in enumerations of what human beings at various ages-especially adolescence-are prone to think about, attend to, and react emotionally upon, and of what they attempt to do or actually do, and how much they feel and imagine and "think." Interspersed everywhere are "genetic" interpretations,-references to analogous phenomena in phylum and race,-and educational and other practical suggestions and considerations, which latter are often of great value, and which taken by and large constitute Hall's major contribution. Analy- sis or scientific description of mental process or reaction or emotion is rarely undertaken excepting in those instances where the object or goal of the reaction is obscure and hence a measure of specification of the reaction itself is necessary,-e. g., in the case of reactions called "automatisms".75 The net yieldings are 73Ibid., 2, 46. 7Ibid., 2, 463. 75Adolescence, I, I54ff. The treatment of automatisms here given- their progressive incorporation into voluntary systems-while not in all respects novel is vividly put and exceedingly suggestive, full of valuable hints for the teacher, clinical psychologist and psychiatrist.

Growth is the subject of the first three chapters of Adoles- cence,-growth in height and weight, of parts and organs, and of motor power and functions. The bulk of these longish chapters is devoted to assembling the results of numerous studies of the rate of growth from embryonic to mature stages, and to in- quiries into the factors which influence growth, to canvassing of opinions relative to the existence of optimal rates of growth, and many similar questions. The immense labor of gathering this material, and the intimations of the possible practical significance of its various phases, make the preparing of the book an outstanding service to the practical worker and to the investigator in the fields of human adjustment and maladjust- ment. The prepubescent retardation, with the subsequent pubescent outburst in which girls precede-revealed in all the studies-is of great interest to Hall; he regards itt76 as a relic of pre-savage and savage epochs, in the first of which the female was forced to assume maternal functions before "nature had completed her preparation" for them, with resultant slowing of growth, while in the later period taboos arose which postponed impregnation and so favored growth activity. Or natural selection may have played a part; since female coyness and reserve develop before full sexual desire, the largest and most vigorous girls would succeed in resisting impregnation and would later produce maturer offspring. From the numerous phenomena of disproportionate growth of parts Hall draws the following conclusion: "If the soul grows with every part of the body, its development is not con- tinuous, uniform or proportionate, but with successive nodes, the earlier stages ever a little more strange and alien to the newer, like dimly remembered past lives to a transmigrationist."77 76How seriously Hall took any one of his "genetic" explanations is a problematic matter; he remarks, "I have constantly suggested genetic explanations of all degrees of probability" (Adolescence, viii). 77Adolescence, I, I28. 35</page><page sequence="36">FISHER The theme of the muscles and their functional growth is an inspiring one to Hall. Muscles are the organs of will, thought and feeling, the media of accomplishment of all human edifice and of character. The development of the muscles in both race and individual according to Hall progresses from that of the larger, fundamental muscles to the finer, accessory ones "that wag the tongue and fingers." This is one of Hall's most insisted-upon precepts for pedagogy; in his education, the child should be encouraged in his impulses to develop his larger muscles before he begins exercising the finer ones. Current tendencies to force him to school before eight years of age are dangerous for the reason that premature exercise of accessory muscles tends to develop precocity, miniature adulthood, with all its attendant risk of a later appearance of "savage" tenden- cies thus crowded out at their normal time of appearance. Muscular development is closely correlated with sexual maturing and Hall finds much to convince him that this in boys is the result of fighting for desired members of the opposite sex, which latter has been and is a principal cause of conflict. The treat- ment of "motor automatisms"-by which is meant the total of "unconscious" movements such as swayings, tappings, fingering of objects; in short the total of movements sometimes referred to as random-has many elements of practical insight and valu- able suggestion, however one may regard the genetic interpreta- tions offered. These movements present survivals of old adjust- ments worked out by remote ancestors, and their display con- stitutes a necessary and proper stage preliminary to the de- velopment of higher powers. Perhaps they should even be encouraged, if we knew just when, by stimulating reflexes and so promoting "low-level connection between afferent and effer- ent processes that brings the organism into relation with the world of sense." The age of control with inhibition follows: the child must learn to sit still, a difficult task. But almost im- mediately Hall recalls the more modern conception of inhibition as a long-circuiting of processes and a directing of energy else- where, and the "psychonomic law" is for a time in abeyance while the author makes many observations of insight and sug- gestiveness especially in the matter of present social conditions which impede desirable growth-processes. The automatisms 36</page><page sequence="37">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL are the raw material of intellect, feeling and will, and education should so guide events that none is left to expend its strength outside of the domain of voluntary control, integrated habit- patterns. Thus integrated, the fullest strength is available,- witness the superiority of the brain-worker to the manual laborer in tests with the dynamometer because of the former's ability to turn into one outlet energy generated over a larger surface. But the integrating process may be arrested. Automatisms are similar to ideas, which tend to grow to delusional "intensity" unless checked by others; thus movement may "pass to fixed attitudes and postures of limbs and body, disturbing the normal balance of flexors and extensors." "They are motor analogues of the stray, segregated psychoses that make the subconscious activities now beginning to be studied".78 Children of twelve who sway, can't sit still, possess these automatisms in most marked form and are often the constitutionally duller ones. The chief of the avoidable causes of such anarchical movements is overpressure, misfit between environment and nature. To avoid this, safeguards are needed superior to gymnastics; and the sad inadequacy of the many "schemelets" extant is shown by the puny bodies and nervous youths so commonly seen at the present day. Hall discusses the inadequacy of the modern in- dustrial city with its passive amusements or at best activities under unhealthy conditions as a substitute for the older supreme- ly educative home life-especially on the farm-in a manner the reading of which could not but be beneficial to any individ- ual who attempts to work with youth in the city, and which has already exerted a marked influence. As to remedial measures: the farm is the best educator. Industrial education is beneficial in proportion as other phases (scientific, historical) are em- phasized in addition to the mere acquiring of skill. Sloyd tends to the grave educational error of overstress on method and loss of content and goal and individuality of emphasis. Many forms of outlet overstress back and shoulder and arm muscles at the expense of leg muscles. Studies showing the sporadic growth of skills indicate the need of wider knowledge of characteristic "plateau" periods with stress on sense or perceptual training which will encourage subsequent motor spurts. 78Ibid., o60. 37</page><page sequence="38">FISHER The psychology and pedagogy of play follow, in the dis- cussion of which, after the recapitulatory interpretation, occur many points illuminating to the individual who would increase motivation and zest in childrens' activities, the main difference between play and work lying in strength of motivation. "The heart of youth goes out to play, as if man remembered a para- dise." "Interest and play are one and inseparable as body and soul. Duty itself is not adequately conceived and felt if it is not pleasure, and it is generally too feeble and fitful in the young to awaken much energy or duration of action. . . Work is menial, cheerless, grinding, regular, and requires more precision and accuracy and, because attended with less ease and pleasure and economy of movement, is more liable to produce erratic habits. The worst product of striving to do things with de- fective psychic impulsion is fatigue in its common forms, which slows down the pace, multiplies errors and inaccuracies, and develops slovenly habits, ennui, flitting will spectres, velleities and caprices and neurasthenic symptoms generally. . . In- still into a boy's soul learning which he sees and feels not to have the slightest worth and which cannot become a part of his active life and increase it, and his freshness, spontaneity, and the fountains of play slowly run dry in him, and his youth fades to early desiccation."79 Following the cues suggested by asymmetries and block- ages of growth at lower levels, Hall takes up in two succeeding chapters the problems of diseases of body and mind, and juvenile faults, immoralities, and crimes. His thesis is that, in the light of the evidence that ontogeny often reverses or fails to follow phylogeny, we have at adolescence a period of great temporary plasticity, a loosening of the bonds that hold developing parts into a more or less unitary whole, and a struggling among ancestral elements which are compactly knitted together in proportion to the time of their association in the phylum. The bulk of the text is devoted to the assembling of studies upon the incidence at adolescence of various diseases and insanities, the effects of school upon health, and the like. Mental peculiarities of adolescence receive much space, and for these Hall draws heavily upon his questionary returns, finding many perversions "Ibid., 233 ff. 38</page><page sequence="39">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL of appetite, irregularities of sleep, intensification of dream life and fancy, over-meticulousness, consciousness of self and over- assertion of individuality with silliness largely due to fear of ridicule in connection with developing fancies and sentiments, marked tendencies to imitate due to the very uncertainty and turmoil and furnishing a basis for the "social instinct," dramatic trends, loquacity and also shyness. All youth is for a short time at least genius, and genius is the apotheosis of adolescence in gifted individuals. "Excess of normal vitality not only safely can but must explore the beginnings of many morbidities, both to know the more varied and intense possibilities of human life and to evoke the sanifying correctives."80 Sex functions ap- pear first as irradiating activity and later as localized sensa- tions, not as yet associated with the opposite sex, before the brain reacts on the sex organs and control is established. Along with these manifold tendencies the cerebral controlling mechan- isms (judgment and "common sense") are developing and normal personality results in proportion as these show their influence. Any factors that make for precocity-springing up of sex and other instincts before normal control processes can assert themselves-are favorable for the development of mor- bidity and mental aberration, and to the formation of a blas6 outlook, with deadening of admiration and enthusiasm. Hall thinks that previous bad pedagogy and many conditions in- cidental to city life and civilization with its prolonging of the period of apprenticeship are among the leading causes of such arrest. He suggests also the r6le of race mixture. Youthful offences are indications of the difficulty experienced by youth in adjusting itself to social conditions. Normal children manifest at various stages of their development all the main "savage" and atavistic tendencies which, if disproportion- ately developed or not checked by tendencies which normally appear later, and if made more consequential by adult bodies, constitute the criminal picture. Criminals are essentially over- grown children. Hall is inclined to accept the view that children who offend are as a rule smaller and to a relatively great extent characterized by asymmetries together with others of the so- called "stigmata of degeneracy" of the Italian school; in his 80"bid., 321. 39</page><page sequence="40">FISHER opinion, biological considerations would favor the view that physical asymmetry is prone to accompany exceptional charac- ter and conduct. Decadent stocks and retrograding functions are frequent biological phenomena. Among the causes of "crime" in juveniles, then, we must reckon the existence of an "innately criminal" mind, a "degenerate" in whose case per- haps the "animal part of his nature is abnormally and con- genitally disproportionate to the intellectual," and who is sure to be an easy victim of the influence of the seasoned criminal with his "society-owes-me-a-living" code. Poor intelligence, which checks the development of the controlling process, is another cause, and a discussion of tests of intelligence occurs in Educa- tional Problems.8l Many environmental causes are discussed,- poverty and degradation in the home, hunger, weather, school, restriction, inadequate training. "There is a pregnant truth in the saying that every society has just the kind and number of criminals that it deserves." "One thing is certain, that the great body of crime is not to be essentially reduced by criminal codes, however skilfully drawn, but only by bettering the individual and social conditions of the community at large."82 The remedies are, first, understanding, living with the "crim- inal" youths. "Those smitten with the institution craze or with any extreme correctionalist views will never solve the problem of criminal youths." Those who deal with such youths "should be educators with souls full of fatherhood and motherhood, and they should understand that the darkest criminal propensities are frequently offset by the best qualities, that in the criminal constitution there are precisely the same ingredients, although perhaps differently compounded, . . as in themselves."83 Flogging and scolding have advantages, if used judiciously. Reading of exciting adventure stories in tender years may serve as a catharsis in the Aristotelian sense, "to arouse betimes the higher faculties which develop later, and whose function it is to deplete the bad centers and suppress or inhibit their activity." Boxing furnishes both vent for and encouragement to control of the anger impulse. Improving the efficiency of the schools as agents in moral training by utilization of the sentiment of 8Vol. 2, Chap.

The handling of sexual development and periodicity and of adolescent love includes the usual discussions of the vast biological r6le of sex and love, and a massing of data on phy- siology and growth of sex organs, effects of castration, studies and opinions regarding nutritive and other accompaniments of periodicity in women. The assumed effects upon the soul of the organic basis of sex, especially in women, prompt discussions of attitudes and psychical phenomena related to sex whose ex- istence in any save a few abnormal women is very problematical, and suggests a regime of periodic rest and retiring to medita- tions upon the vast racial trust which is hers that the author, in a less strained mood, would probably condemn as admirably calculated to produce the sympathy-craving, symptom-monger- ing neurotic invalid whose appearance he elswhere deplores. Part of the description of adolescent calf-love is exceedingly striking and judicious, both in Adolescence and in the chapter on the budding girl in Educational Problems, although its character is essentially literary rather than scientific. Long chapters on the adolescert quickening to nature and on the phenomena of religious conversion are included, with pedagogi- cal suggestions. The importance of a broad religious training in guiding adolescent feelings, especially love, to a love of righteous- ness, of humanity and of the universe is stressed; this is the most powerful means of steering in safety through the storm and stress period. There is no domain of education, from kinder- garten to university, from trades to classics, and no type of institution or provision for atypicals, but receives consideration and pedagogical suggestions. In the course of the writings under consideration, Hall works out more or less detailed descriptions of at least five stages of life, with suggestions regarding the racial period which formed the stage and with outlining of the type of pedagogy desirable for each one. The period of infancy and early child- hood harks back to remote animal ancestors. The child should be much left to nature, the parents and teachers following the promptings of love; sand, large blocks, abundant opportunities 4I</page><page sequence="42">FISHER to exercise the larger muscles are the order of the day. A second unique period in human life is the age from eight to twelve. The brain is nearly adult in size and weight, health is almost at its best, activity is greater and more varied than at any other time, there is peculiar endurance and resistance to fatigue. "The child develops a life of his own outside the home circle, and its natural interests are never so independent of adult in- fluence. Perception is very acute. .... Reason, true morality, religion, sympathy, love and esthetic enjoyment are but very slightly developed. Everything in short suggests the culmination of one stage of life as if it thus represented what was once, for a very protracted and relatively stationary period, the age of maturity in some remote, perhaps pigmoid stage, . . when in a warm climate the young of our species once shifted for themselves. Heredity is more stable . . . the elements of personality are few but are well organized and on a simple effective plan." At eight years, Hall reluctantly concedes, the child must start school and precociously work the smaller muscles, for he is a candidate for a highly developed humanity. The insight necessary to give response to school tasks is not present, the wisest requirements seem alien, but the senses are alert and reactions are vigorous. Consequently this is the age for drill, breaking the child into basic habits of all sorts with the least amount of explanation or coquetting for natural interest. The method should be authoritative, dogmatic. Duty and the spirit of obedience must be instilled. The adolescent, next, is neo-atavistic. Development is more saltatory, suggestive of some ancient period of storm and stress when old moorings were broken and a higher level was attained. There are increased morbidity and diminished morality, re- constructions of the functions of every sense, progressive as- sertion of sex, lust to know nature, and many other changes in- cluding those heretofore mentioned.8 Then comes later adolescence, about the nineteenth year, marked in boys by a practical cessation of growth, by some decline in the curve of health, and by "other phenomena that suggest that, having achieved adult size, there is likely to be a period of slightly re- duced vigor as if to rest and adjust after being cast up by a 84Adolescence, Preface. 42</page><page sequence="43">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL flood-tide on the shore of manhood a little exhausted . . At this point perhaps the individual represents the phyletic stage where, in its survival value in the struggle for existence, the advantages of increased size and strength began to be sur- passed by those of a higher mentality and the main current of evolution swerved thought-ward." Loosened cohesions are being re-compacted. To fit this age, the college should stand for extensive rather than intensive study.85 Then follow the stages of maturity, the "youth of old age," and senescence, where the feelings, although often vivid, are suppressed and the intellectual functions and the wisdom which only age can bring are in their glory. If the race is ever to achieve its goal, "ripe and normal old age" must "gather the fruitage of the past" and "penetrate further into the future."86 The above is far from being a complete presentation of the many trends and varied phenomena which Hall attributes to adolescence and to other ages, and of his numerous discussions regarding the value of dancing, music, art, and other branches in meeting the needs of the different stages of development. The writer believes, however, that it is typical. From the psychology which Hall developed mainly in Adolescence his later-culminat- ing interests in Freudianism and in religious psychology ema- nated. Hall's stress upon feeling and his centralizing of the phenomena of adolescence about sexual development and the associated evolution of love made him an eager student of the Freudian views. He never fully accepted the Freudian doctrines of the all-dominance of sex, for he regarded hunger as its co- partner in directing the struggles of the phylum and hence of the individual, and even made hunger the subject of a course of lectures in which he traced the influence of appetite and the factor of nutrition in shaping the feelings, instincts, habits and mind in general. He also outlined a scheme for applying the Freudian mechanisms to anger.87 In spite of these and other reservations, however, his enthusiasm for Freudianism grew and found its most conspicuous expressions in his zeal for introduc- 8Ibid., 2, 527 f.

From his early concern with theology and philosophy Hall carried a deep-seated interest in the psychology of religion-in religion explained as a need and construct of the soul, divorced of any supernaturalism, and (as his interest in youth grew) adapted to the requirements of the ephebic mind as he conceived it. Much of the chapter on Conversion in Adolescence is de- voted to developing a "human" Jesus and a religion which should create in youth a feeling of unity with humanity and the universe and should guide the developing capacities of love in these directions and so constitute a supreme socializing in- fluence. Trends emanating from this felt need, brought to a focus by the biographical methods of the psychoanalysts, led to the writing of the two-volume Jesus the Christ in the Light of Psychology, which appeared in 1917 and is in some respects the best of Hall's works because his methods were best fitted to this type of task. Here he traced extensively religious doctrines and cults current at the time, and developed the thesis that the Christian faith could be explained as a project of the folk and individual soul, or that, if Jesus were an historical character, the ideas of messianity and of son-ship to God could have de- veloped in him as a result of influences extant in his day. The somewhat Hegelian interpretation of the death and resurrection motif as a kind of summation of life is much stressed by Hall, who finds it pervading initiation ceremonies, myths, history, and even the evolutionary processes themselves. In addition to his many books and articles, almost four- hundred in number, Hall's activities during the Clark period in- cluded the founding of three additional journals, two of which are still in existence. In I891 he started, at his own expense, the Pedagogical Seminary, a large part of the contents of which in the early volumes came from himself and from Clark col- leagues and students. The American Journal of Religious Psychology and Education he started with the aid of the Univer- sity in 1904; at the fifth volume the name was shortened to the Journal of Religious Psychology, and the editing passed largely 44 FISHER</page><page sequence="45">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL into the hands of Dr. A. F. Chamberlain, with whose death in 19I4 its publication ceased. In I9I7, Hall and Dr. L. R. Geissler started the Journal of Applied Psychology. In viewing Hall's work as a whole, many internal contradic- tions stand out, perhaps because it is in a state of rapid and tumultuous growth and inner incompatible enthusiasms not unlike the adolescent whom Hall describes.88 These very inner incompatibilities serve to sharpen pedagogical problems and hence have a value to education which is not inconsiderable. Of these conflicting trends, the most marked is the opposition between the order of nature demanded by bionomic and psycho- nomic laws, on the one hand, and the regimen and control de- manded by practical situations, on the other,-a duality which is not without reminders of Kant's distinction between the pure and the practical reason. The "surge and thunder" of the genetic currents lead Hall into positions which he rejects when the set is otherwise, because he is also an observer of insight and possessed of much of the "common sense" which he evaluates so highly at times; despite his antipathy to explaining by the nearest cause,89 he is not unmindful of it in practical connec- tions. The difficulty appears in the need for the eight-year-old to enter school and run the risk of "precocity" by developing accessory muscles. If the principle of the dangers of a later outcrop of "savage" tendencies and of the basis for a criminal career thus afforded holds, should we not rather re-make the whole system on the order-of-nature basis than take such chances with childhood? Again, the authoritative regimen and stress on duty, obedience, and drill indicated by the non- rational character of the child provide what we later read is the best possible basis for truancy, development of automatisms and lack of volitional concentration; and, moreover, it fails to utilize the zest of the play-tendencies. As Winch pointed out,90 there is truth on both sides, and later pedagogical resources and "model" schools have gone far toward combining the advant- ages of the two. The disparity between the need of concreteness and the need of more abstract language symbols is in similar 88Cf. review of Adolescence by E. L. Thorndike, Educ. Rev., 28, 1904, 217-227. 80Op. cit., Note 29, p. 20, this JOURNAL, I8I. 90W. H. Winch, review of Adolescence in Mind, N. S. 14, 1905, 259-264. 45</page><page sequence="46">FISHER case. Again, the difficulty appears in the uncertain rble as- signed to the "higher" consciousness, the organizing and adjust- ing mental functions; composing in the "genetic" key Hall makes these somewhat abortive and conducive to casuistry, but when the key shifts to the practical, they are glorified into "common sense," the greatest hope of youth and the basis of the supreme contribution of age. The regime which the ideal woman should follow in the light of the genetic law would exclude her entirely from the consolations of senecsence. That which alone can save erring youth spells doom to morale in the soldier. If the "genetic" law holds and feelings are the fundamentally reliable guide (Morale), why the disadvantage of mental defect? and so forth. The question has important bearings for ethics, but is confusing to the main issues and out of place in psychology, whose problems are quite otherwise. Hall encounters difficulties similarly conditioned in his teaching relative to the fate of stages of development which have been passed or skipped in the individual. If the complete realization of one stage, in so far as possible, is the essential condition to the stimulation of the next, how is precocity possible? And if a stage is crowded out by circumstances, how can it break out later in the absence of its requisite stimulus? Hall takes refuge in the reversions of stages and the jostling of diverse traits, and in the view that environ- mental suggestion is equally capable of evoking a stage; so many concessions are made, however, that one suspects the significance if not the fact of any "order of nature." Difficulties incidental to practical needs for repressing "animal" and "sav- age" stages have frequently been indicated by Hall's critics. Hall's unqualified acceptance of the doctrine of the inherit- ance of acquired characteristics leads him to the view that the acquisitions of the individual cannot be transmitted and so accrue to the race unless maturity is reached before reproduc- tion, a position which bodes ill for the race ever acquiring the later valuable maturity of old age unless we draw heavily on the principle of the variability of sex on the age scale. Another "internal" difficulty appears in the inability to establish stages in the individual of sufficient definiteness to warrant the phylogenetic explanation. Both the paleo-atavistic child and the neo-atavistic adolescent have "births" or "golden 46</page><page sequence="47">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL ages" of sense, of perception, of imagination. Both require ex- ercise of fundamental muscles. The descriptions of the crudities of behavior-especially that concerned in interest in the oppo- site sex-of the child and the adolescent have much in common. Many difficulties of an external character may be urged against Hall's psychology,-difficulties of method and of fact. Hot-footed in his quest for data to fill out the gaps in the known evolutionary process and indifferent to other problems, he was too impatient to use the slow and to him insufferably tedious methods of the laboratory. In I904 he expressed regret that some of the "new psychologists" (which at that date meant experimental psychologists) go no further, being content only to make methods more exact and results more refined.9' "Scienti- fic psychology was becoming more and more prone to flout the good old Aristotelian dictum to the effect that it was only affectation to treat any subject by more exact methods than the subject matter demanded. Hence I felt that laboratory psy- chology had been influenced too much by the exact physical sciences and not enough by biology." "Introspection made no attempt to explain the flitting vestigial and marginal states" that its devotees "recorded, or to trace the differences in these phenomena to their origin in individual disposition or exper- ience, and drew few and meagre conclusions from the vast body of data which they accumulated."92 In addition to such complaint, Hall's objection to the introspective technique at least was based on his view of the limitations of consciousness, that it must perforce be useless in proportion as work becomes fundamental,-although he takes it more seriously in his attack 9gThe New Psychology as a Basis of Education, Forum, I7, I894, 7Io- 720. 92Life and Confessions, 36I, 433. At the time of the first intense in- terest in the higher thought processes as attacked in the laboratory, shortly after the publication of Titchener's Experimental Psychology of the Thought Processes, one of Hall's students incorporated the concepts of the Aufgabe, the Einstellung and the determinierende Tendenz in his thesis. A stormy time followed; but Hall's lectures soon began to teem with references to the laboratory work on the higher mental processes, and he called at the quarters of certain of the laboratory students with the request that they review their data with him very carefully. His hope that the laboratory had its hands on the tail of an ancient lead-if such hopes he had-were apparently disappointed, however, for in Life and Confessions (36I) he speaks of the concepts in question as "something like categories". 47</page><page sequence="48">FISHER upon Kant's schemata.93 Hall's revolt against exact methods was extreme, and he failed to employ them even in departments of "genetic" psychology where they might have done valuable service, e. g., in work upon variations in sensitivity with age. But for the most part Hall's objection that the more controlled methods could be of little immediate aid to his problems was justified, and he chose the only one available for obtaining in sufficient quantity and form the data he needed. Many of his critics have held that Hall employed the questionary in a fashion not adequate to rule out its obvious sources of error.94 The objections advanced are not without ground, and many of Hall's norms of behavior will undoubtedly undergo a shift in a direction away from the emotional and perfervid extreme. His use of statistical and other studies in supplementing the ques- tionary, moreover, is open to tte objection of over-epitomizing and under-evaluating; the labors of compilation have been immense, and the service is great, but more extensive presenta- tion of mean variations and of critical interpretation in the light of method would have added much both to the labor and to the value. Finally, the major assumptions of Hall's psychology have everywhere been called into question. The attacks upon the culture-epoch theory, the doubtful status of the doctrine of the inheritance of acquired neuromuscular dispositions, and the light shed by anthropology upon the true character of the mind of primitive man are too well known to require comment. Hall's phylogenetic interpretations and anthropological data are frequently not corroborated by workers in the fields in question.95 Biology in Hall's hands often has a teleological ring, and the use of natural selection as a warrant for optimism is far from clear. The direct application of biological principles to consciousness arouses grave difficulties, however illuminating these principles may be when applied to behavior; such concepts as those of "Why Kant is Passing, op. cit., 373, "No experimental or introspective study of the processes of perceiving and comprehending things ever found the filmiest trace of any part of these schemata." Kant might have answer- ed that his categories affect consciousness without penetrating it. 94Cf. esp. E. L. Thorndike, The Original Nature of Man, Educational Psychology, I, 28-37. For a statement of the advantages and limitations of the questionary, cf. Titchener, op. cit., Note 20, 387. 96Cf., e. g., Van Waters, The Adolescent Girl among Primitive Peoples, Jour. of Relig.

Consciousness has a way of being most keen and pointed in moments of emotional flux, and often of lowering at more static periods. Accessory as well as fundamental muscles figure in earliest infantile reactions and throughout the course of habit formation. And similarly with reasoning, imagination, feeling; more careful studies show a gradual growth of these functions, extending to an ever widening subject- matter, rather than a sudden appearance at any one stage. Studies of the conditioning of emotional reactions indicate the possibility of very young children forming intense emotional at- tachments which in some cases may have permanent conse- quences. The man of science marked by reserve, his enthusiasms conditioned to matters of method and system, intolerant of loose ends and contradictions, his eyes strained for the exception which may test the rule, evaluating his findings in the light of method and technique rather than in terms of their positive or negative character or far-reachingness, choosing his problems not without regard to his conception of the state of develop- ment of his science and their possibility of solution by reliable methods, will never count Hall among his fellows, however much he may value the contribution of Hall in pushing forward the frontiers of interest in science. For in almost all respects Hall is his opposite. Possessed of an enormous energy and vitality which unfitted him for the labor of patient attack on a limited front, he belonged in large measure to the type which includes new pioneers of imagination. The individual of this type must have great unifying instruments, ideas which almost at the first encountering leap into place and provide outlets for torrents which refuse to be hampered by the slow process of verification, but instead rush into new continents, whose tenability will have to be determined by later careful prospecting and examining. The dominant theme is its own category of criticism; results and theories are judged in terms of their possibility for unifying large masses of data or for promoting the dominant explanatory concept rather than in terms of consistency and method. One field after another becomes the scene of activity. In a mind possessed of impressibility and powers of rapid apprehension, 49</page><page sequence="50">the drive of the idea makes possible a vast deal of reading, be- cause of the adventure of finding grist for its mill, but it inhibits critical estimate of what is read. Nothing slows down the pro- cess; the thinker sees whatever thought it is that possesses him pervading and explaining the universe; he becomes almost a prophet, a mystic, an arriver at ultimate reality. So far-reach- ing in its possible effects upon human happiness and self- knowledge does the idea-self-stripped of obstacles-appear, that its possessor unwittingly turns propagandist. Such en- thusiasm speeds abroad; many are inspired to specialize, and large audiences of workers are shaken and set about the task of application. In considerable measure Hall approximates this type. He does not present it in its most rugged form, however, possibly because he never completely shook off the influence of the puri- tan outlook and doctrines among which he spent his earliest boyhood. His revolt, he tells us, created a certain sadness, a deep feeling of isolation, of being misunderstood, and he "con- fesses" in himself a certain apologetic strain.96 This appears in a perceptible emasculation in his writings when he is touching upon such themes as would be most emotionally loaded for the conservative, somewhat smug puritan spirit. In connection with his handling of youthful "crimes", where certain remarks (quoted on p. 40) indicate insight into the need for a vigorous and searching analysis of the social structure in its responsibility for crime, he takes his main refuge in a view similar to the seriously discredited position of the Italian school, and refers to a "criminal type," to "degenerates," to the "animal part" of nature, etc., in a fashion that smacks almost of certain semi- theological treatments, although it has also a certain harmony with "genetic" psychology. His ascription to the savage and the child of traits present in the majority of untrained adult human beings-"With children as well as savages, truth de- pends largely upon personal likes and dislikes"-perhaps re- flects the same temper. Still more does this trend emerge in relation to the treatment of sex, especially in its perverse mani- festations, where occur expressions of a rather tense ethical character which ring strangely in a scientifically aimed treatise "9Life and Confessions, 594, 571, 575, 589. 50o FISHER</page><page sequence="51">GRANVILLE STANLEY HALL and lead to uncertainty as to what fundamentally the author's position is. Some biographer of wisdom and insight, working possibly along lines of the same general direction as those laid down by Kempf,97 may in time explain in a thoroughgoing fashion this trend, which more than any other prevents Hall's books from being an expression of genius, however much of genius there was in his personality. But if in one sense Hall was too conscious of his puritan "folk-soul" audience, in another sense he was too oblivious of existing forms. His psychology itself was too much based on revolt, on complaint with existing philosophical systems as opposed to careful "inside" criticism of them, and was too anarchistic, to be likely to withstand the test of time. The re- finement of concepts and critical studies in the fields of anthro- pology, psychology, and to a great extent of biology, failed to find sufficient place in his thinking to give his psychological work the alignment with progress necessary for permanent position and real contribution. And he made the systematic error of trying to find well-marked stages and distinctions in his given material instead of working out clear concepts which might serve as the basis of a scientific classification. In casting about for bases of comparison, in speculating as to what field would have furnished the most adequate outlet for his genius, one is tempted to consider literature. Where Hall is at his best, both his method and his observations have been essentially literary,-the products of insightful noting. This trait appears in the descriptions of youth and childhood, when the "psy- chonomic law" is temporarily set aside; in the description of the menace of modern civilization to youth; and in many other in- stances where he discusses practical needs and applications. Many of Hall's views have been expressed in different connec- tions in literature; thus, one of his criteria of success, sympathy, is closely akin to what Anatole France recognized as a mark of genius.98 He has a gift for the living word and phrase, a style which embodies the feeling of genius. But the fact of his just missing hardihood, or whatever it is which at times prevents complete absorption in his theme,-probably somehow related, 97Psychopathology, 1921. g8Gsell's Opinions of Anatole France. 5I</page><page sequence="52">FISHER as we have suggested, to his struggles with his early puritan environmeDt,-would have hampered him more in attaining greatness in literature; here, too, his leanings to propaganda would have been a more serious retarding influence, and also the lack of restraint in his style, the occasional figure which be- clouds, the obscurity or repetition of figures which had strong appeal and are often very beautiful. It seems not unlikely, then, that Hall found the type of work which could give his genius the best expression,-that of pioneer and prophet of a young and growing science sufficiently related to practical needs to offer opportunity for the enthusiastic propa- gandist. Here he could perform his most brilliant and distin- guished service. Here lack of system was the least handicap, for the times were not ripe for system in psychology. His chief temperamental needs were socially polarized,-to extend, to impress students and others, to apply, to create opportunities for freedom and avenues for publication of work; and for this his style was supremely fitted. He was rarely equipped for the task of "generating interest over a large surface," which the worker, with his problems upon him, can turn into a narrow outlet; and from workers in the field of education have come the most enthusiastic tributes. Hall, the "passionate lover" of youth and childhood, has served youth more than arything else, and espe- cially handicapped, adult-ridden youth. There is no field of edu- cation but has felt the influence emanating from him and has been markedly benefited; and if every worker who is concerned with the handling of childhood and adolescents were familiar with the assembled information, tenets and spirit of Hall's writings, a mighty stride would be taken toward the solution of the prob- lems of criminology and a new day would dawn for youth. 52</page></plain_text>
