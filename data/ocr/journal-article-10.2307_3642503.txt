<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT CAN HASAN FOURTH PRELIMINARY REPORT, 1964 By D. H. FRENCH THE WORK THIS year at Can Hasan took place, as usual, in the autumn. Excavation began on 6th September and finished on I oth October. A further week was spent on the detailed work of planning, photography and pottery study. We employed this year, as in previous years, Veli Karaaslan as foreman, Rifat Qelimli, Mustafa Duman, and Bekir Kalaycl as ustas ; from Mentes we employed three men and from Canasun village five men. During the season, parts of the excavated area, which had not been completely covered, were filled in with earth from this year's excavation. At the end of the season only those areas where further work is planned remained open. The fence, of posts and wire, was repaired. The watchman now lives in the dig-house on the edge of the mound. For this year there was a staff of twelve : Messrs. N. H. S. Kindersley, D. C. Biernoff, R. W. Dutton, S. Payne, and J. E. Reade, field assistants; Mr. I. J. Walls, architect; Mrs. D. C. Biernoff and the Misses M. A. White, T. Martin, V. Pemberton-Piggott, P. M. Pratt, and R. J. Worth, house assistants. In addition, Mr. Kindersley worked on photography and planning, Mr. Dutton assisted the architect, Mr. Biernoff took charge of the bone material and Mr. Payne of the obsidian. Mrs. Biernoff, Miss White, Miss Martin and Miss Pratt were conservators. Bay Hayrettin Solmaz of the Konya Museum represented the Turkish Government. THE 1964 SEASON There were two aims for the 1964 season. The first was to excavate more buildings of the Late Chalcolithic period (layer I) ; the second was to expand the work on the Middle Chalcolithic period (layer 2 A) in the north-west corner of the excavated area. For the first, we began digging to the south and east of those squares excavated in 1963; this year's squares are numbered T 25 a, T 25 c, S 25 c and d, S 26 a and b. For the second, we began in squares Q 2I c and Q 22 a. When well preserved buildings of the Late Chalcolithic period appeared in Q 22 a, more squares were opened up to the south ; these were P 22 d, Q22 c, Q23 a. LAYER I IRON AGE AND LATER A large number of pits was found in all parts of the excavated area. All are of recent date, i.e. Iron Age or succeeding periods. There are as yet no buildings associated with these pits. Sherds of a jar of Phrygian Grey ware from pits 2 and 3 in square S 25 d are the first certain pieces of this type found at Can Hasan. LA TE CHALCOLITHIC The Late Chalcolithic buildings and other structures found in 1963 were, on the whole, poorly preserved. In 1964, on the other hand, the walls belonging to this period were not so badly destroyed by the late pits. In one building (in square S 26 a) the walls were preserved in some places to a height of over I metre. Because of the depth of fill inside these walls, the amount of material which could be recovered was greater than elsewhere on the site. The condition of the soil was soft and full of ash (but not much charcoal). The total fill inside the walls was, therefore, sieved. A fair amount of small fragments of bone and shell, small chips, flakes and blades of obsidian, as well as carbonized grain and seeds and miniature clay artifacts was recovered from the sieving.</page><page sequence="2">88 ANATOLIAN STUDIES ARCHITECTURE (Plan: Fig. I; Sections : Fig. 2) The buildings of this period were made of comparatively small mud bricks. There are no signs of timbering or of stone foundations. The inside face of the walls was covered with thick white plaster. Floors were given a coating of hard white clay. This was frequently relaid. There is no evidence for the methods of roofing. A certain amount of space was also given to courtyards. In these courtyards were built ovens and small enclosures or bins with thin narrow walls. All these structures were constantly changed and adapted. Walls were strengthened. In some cases old walls were broken down and new ones built either above or on a different line (see plan, Fig. I). It is not clear yet what the reasons for this constant change were, but it is possible that the open lay-out of the settlement made it easier to rebuild and replan the structures. Possibly too the lay-out was influenced by the very steep slope (from north to south) which we know to have existed in this area at the beginning of the Late Chalcolithic period. Late Chalcolithic structures also occurred on the west side of the excavation area. A floor and hearth overlay the Middle Chalcolithic deposit in square Q 21 c ; in square Q 22 a and the adjacent squares a relatively complete building (the con- tinuation of one discovered in 1962, see below Corrigenda p. 91) with well preserved white clay plaster on floors and walls was cleared. POTTERY (Figs. 4, 5) The following are the types of pottery occurring in Late Chalcolithic deposits: I. Red and Black Burnished Ware (Fig. 4 : 1-4, 7-15 ; 5 : 1, 3-IO).-This was the most common ware and a wide range of shapes were made in it: carinated hole- mouth bowls or jars (Fig. 4 : 14; 5 : 1) with lug or horn handles (Fig. 5 : 4) ; simple hemispherical or slightly carinated bowls often with loop handle rising above the rim (Fig. 5 : 12) ; straight sided bowls with vertical lug handles and a raised base (Fig. 4 : 2 ; 5 : 5) ; small jars with offset rim (Fig. 4 : 3, Io). The surface was well burnished although the fabric was thick and often coarse. Occasional pieces were only very slightly burnished (Fig. 4: I7). Also rather less well burnished (particu- larly on the lower part which was often unslipped) are carinated jars with a short straight neck (Fig. 4 : 4, et al.). 2. Scored Ware.-This surface treatment is distinctive. It is most frequently found on the outside of jars (Fig. 4": I6) and the inside of platters (Fig. 4": 5, 6). 3. White painted Ware.-This is not common. A fine white paint was used on straight-sided bowls ; a thick heavy type was used on jars. Both types are matt. 4. Red or Brown Painted Ware.-There are only a few pieces of this ware. They do not form a homogeneous group. Two may perhaps be imports. 5. Incised Ware.-This is not common nor do the pieces make a homogeneous group. One piece is illustrated (Fig. 4 : 6). Also illustrated are sherds with stamped (Fig. 5 : Ii) and with grooved decoration (Fig. 5 2). SMALL OBJECTS Stone.-An unusual find was a large group of river and volcanic stones suitable for use as polishers and grinders but only a few of which had actually been used. Querns, mortars, grinders, polishers and other items of domestic equipment were common.</page><page sequence="3">CANHASAN 3\ M 26 26 $ T FIG. I. Plan of Late Chalcolithic Buildings ; phases c and d.

Clay.-Horned potstands with one or two handles were common, and amorphous fragments of other clay fittings, at present unintelligible, were found in both the buildings and the courtyards. Small clay artifacts include sling bullets, small animal figurines (the majority either fragmentary or amorphous; on some the species was roughly shown), and human figurines of miniature size (male and female) with both plastic and incised detail. 526a S S26 b lI 1110 "Tg 7 8 1--T- .I I -F-L 2M FIG. 2. Section of the north face of squares S 26 a and b and diagram of pottery batches. Scale I : Ioo. Metal.-There was a slight trace of corroded copper from square S 25 c. Bone.-Artifacts of bone were rarer than in layer 2 A. Only a few points, one sleeve (of bone and not horn) and a spoon were found. Grain and Seed.-Several good samples for identification were recovered from sieving the fill of the building in square S 26 a. Bones.-Remains of sheep, goat, cow, horse, pig (all presumably domesticated), cat and tortoise have been identified. LAYER 2 A The character of the Middle Chalcolithic (layer 2 A) deposit that was excavated in i 964 at the north-west corner of the excavation area in square Q 2 z c was similar to that of the deposits excavated in 1962. It consisted of a succession of thin soil strata and ash lines. These were excavated individually. Between two of these ash lines an extensive and close-packed deposit of animal bone and sherds was discovered. It was necessary to lift these bones slowly; for this reason the total area of the layer 2 A deposit excavated was not so great as had been originally planned. ARCHITECTURE Though no structures of the Middle Chalcolithic period have been cleared, a wall with layer 2 A pottery lying against and over it was found in square Q 21 c.</page><page sequence="5">90 ANATOLIAN STUDIES It is however not yet clear whether this wall was built during, and belongs entirely to, the 2 A period or was the stump of a layer 2 B wall re-used. Evidence for the re-use of 2 B buildings in the 2 A period was found in 1962. POTTERY (Fig. 3) As previously the 2 A deposit yielded a considerable quantity of pottery. I. Painted Ware.-The most common variety is black or brown on a cream ground but there are many variations of this basic scheme. The fabrics can be divided into several groups but nothing can as yet be said of the significance of these. The typical shapes are round-bellied jars with flaring necks and simple shallow or hemispherical bowls (Fig. 3 : 4). 2. Incised and Plain Burnished Wares.-A small number of simple grey burnished bowls (not strongly carinated as in layer 2 B), some of them incised, were found but fine burnished wares are not common. 3. Plain Ware.-A notable feature of the pottery from square Q 2I c is the increased proportion of this ware. It varies in colour from pale brown to a light buff and is, on the whole, fine and well finished. Very little pottery that can be called coarse has been found in the 2 A deposits. 4. Polychrome Ware (Fig. 3 : 1-3, 5-6).-It is not clear whether or not this ware forms a homogeneous group. Several varieties were noted among the material from square Q 21 c. The typical shapes are bowls (Fig. 3 : 2-3, 5-6) and small jars but at least one large jar was found (Fig. 3 : I). 5. Monochrome Ware.-There are a few sherds mostly from simple hemispherical bowls covered inside and outside with a lightly burnished red or pink wash. SMALL OBJECTS Stone.-There were only three fine objects of stone : two small axes which would probably have fitted onto a sleeve and handle, and a marble bracelet. The heavier stone objects such as querns, pounders and polishers were common. Obsidian.-Only simple blades and flakes were found. Clay.-The potstands of this period differ from those of layer I. They are somewhat anthropomorphic in form. A few animal figurines, somewhat larger than those of layer I, and a spoon were also found in the deposit in square Q 2I c. Bone.-Points and horn sleeves were common in the deposit in square Q 2I c. Grain and Seed.-Only a small quantity of material for analysis was recovered from this layer. Bones.-Many animal bones were recovered both from the large deposit of bones and sherds in square Q 2 ic and from other strata in the same square. Sheep, goat, cow, equid (very small), pig, carnivore, and tortoise have been identified. Dr. Dexter Perkins, Jnr., has identified two skulls of Bos recovered from layer 2 A deposits (from above House 6 in 1962 and from square Q 2I c in 1964) as coming from a domesti- cated species. LAYER 2 B Some further work was done in squares R 21 c and d to clarify the architecture of House 7. At the same time we cleaned the floor at which we had stopped in 1962 and excavated beneath it. Two further floor levels were discovered. From beneath the latest floor (the one at which work had stopped in I962) came a group of long obsidian blades. Obsidian blades of this type and in this number had not previously been found at Can Hasan. Also beneath the latest floor we found animal bones among which was a large equid as well as sheep, goat, cow and pig.</page><page sequence="6">EXCAVATIONS AT CAN HASAN 91 SUMMARY The 1964 season has added nothing to the outline of the stratigraphy given previously but the area of horizontal excavation for the Late Chalcolithic has been increased. At one point, moreover, in the southern area we know that the Late Chalcolithic deposit is at least 4 metres deep. We can therefore hope to find a long sequence of Late Chalcolithic levels. For the Middle Chalcolithic period, although it has yielded a fair quantity of pottery, animal bone and small objects, there are still no architectural remains. Furthermore it is still not clear when the Middle Chalcolithic period finishes and the Late Chalcolithic begins. This question is one of the more interesting of those still to be answered.
