Rebekah Darksmith, Assistant Journals Manager</page><page sequence="15">The AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST (AA) is the flagship journal of the American Anthropological Association (AAA). AA follows the mission statement and goals of the AAA by advancing anthropology as a discipline that studies humankind in all its aspects, involving archaeological, biological, ethnological, and linguistic research. It also attempts to further the professional interests of anthropologists by disseminating anthropological knowledge and illuminating its relevance to human problems. The editor of the journal seeks to enhance the association's mission by publishing articles that add to, integrate, synthesize, and interpret anthropological knowledge; essays on issues of importance to the discipline; research reports; obituaries; and reviews of books, films, and exhibits. Short commentaries of no more than 500 words that further substantive discussion of significant topics that have appeared in AA in the previous six months will be published at the editor's discretion, as will reviews of films and museum exhibits. Contributions from all subdisciplines in both their basic and applied dimensions are welcomed, as are those focusing on broad, crosscutting problems, themes, and theories. Manuscripts written for the profession at large that develop general implications from exacting substantive research will be of particular interest. Collaborative work, particularly among colleagues in different subdisciplines, is encouraged, and contributions from international colleagues are desired. Submission Process The preferred means of manuscript submission is electronic, via e-mail attachment. If it is not possible to send a paper electronically, instead submit one hard copy of a manuscript on 8-1/2"x 11" paper and one copy of the final version of the paper on diskette. Whether submitting on diskette or electronically, leave the file in the program used to create it; do not convert to ASCII. For submissions on diskette, place the cover page, abstract, text, notes, references, tables, and a list of figures in one file; figures and photographs should be separate files. Figures or photographs should be submitted as hard copy, slides, or TIF files with resolution of 300 dpi or greater. Include the following information on the diskette label: (1) the filename, (2) the word processing program and its version number, and (3) the operating system. Use only high-density diskettes. Manuscripts should be typed and double spaced, including references, notes, and quotations. Submissions exceeding 8,000 words (including all figures, tables, references, and notes) will not be considered. "Research Reports" submissions must not exceed 3,000 words (including all figures, tables, references, and notes). Submissions self-identified as "Essays" must not exceed 5,000 words (again, inclusive of supporting information). Hard copies and disks are not returned to authors. Submissions must include the following: (1) a cover page with paper title, author's name, position, affiliation, and contact information, and a preferred running head; (2) an abstract of no more than 150 words ending with a bracketed list of three to five keywords or phrases; (3) body of the text; (4) notes, which may include acknowledgments before the first note (do not use footnotes or endnotes and do not embed references); (5) references cited; (6) tables, if applicable; (7) figures, if applicable, accompanied by a list of captions. AA follows Chicago style with a few modifications, most notably in the references cited section. Submitted manuscripts that do not conform to AAA style and format will be returned to authors. The AAA Style Guide appears on the AAA web- site at http://www.aaanet.org/pubs/style_guide.htm. A nonrefundable processing fee of $100 must accompany unsolicited manuscripts from persons who are not members of the association. Please make checks payable to the American Anthropolog- ical Association and mail to Suzanne Mattingly c/o AA submission, 2200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201-3357. Author Responsibilities Authors, not the American Anthropological Association, are responsible for the content of their articles, for the accuracy of quotations and their correct attribution, for the legal rights to publish any material submitted, and for submitting their manuscripts in proper form for publication. A manuscript submitted to AA must not be under consideration by any other journal at the same time or have been published elsewhere, either in part or in its entirety. Evaluation Manuscripts are generally evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief, by one or more members of the Editorial Board, and/or by referees. Authors are invited to suggest potential reviewers; however, the editor will not be bound by these suggestions. New manuscript submissions (articles, commentaries, and research reports) and all related correspondence should be ad- dressed to the Editor-in-Chief, Benjamin Blount, AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, Department of Anthropology, University of Texas at San Antonio, 6900 North Loop 1604 W, San Antonio, TX 78249-0652; 210/458-4657; aaeditor@utsa.edu.
