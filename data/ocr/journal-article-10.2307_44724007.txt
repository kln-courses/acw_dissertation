Suggitt University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ABSTRACT This paper discusses techniques developed and used by the Biosciences Group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) for measuring three- dimensional head motion, skull bone strain, epidural pressure, and internal brain motion of repressurized cadavers and Rhesus monkeys during head impact. In the experimental design, a stationary test subject is struck by a guided moving impactor of 10 kg (monkeys) and 25 or 65 kg (cadavers). The impactor striking surface is fitted with padding to vary the contact force-time characteristics. The experimental technique uses a nine-accelerometer system rigidly affixed to the skull to measure head motion, transducers placed at specific points below the skull to record epidural pressure, repressurization of both the vascular and cerebrospinal systems, and high-speed cineradiography (at 1000 frames per second) of radiopaque targets. The results of several experimental tests imply intractable problems in determining potential injury criteria, such as the HIC, from accelerometer data. IN 1980 U.S. CITIZENS SPENT FOUR BILLION dollars to treat acute head injury of over one million individuals (1-10). Precise figures are not available. It is estimated that 49% of head injuries can be attributed to motor vehicle accidents, 28% to falls, and 23% to other causes such as suicide attempts, firearm injuries, recreational and occupational accidents (1-10). Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATD' s) are used in automotive safety testing to assess potential injury to the human head. These devices have triaxial accelerometer clusters mounted at the center of gravity of their heads. The resultant acceleration obtained from the triaxial accelerometer measurement when the ATD is placed in an impact environment, such as an automobile crash test, is used to calculate a kinematic Head Injury Criterion (HIC) . A HIC value of 1000 in the ATD model has been chosen as the value equivalent to initiation of injury in living humans in a similar impact environ- ment. The 1000 threshold was derived from ex- perimental impact work with human cadavers in which the accelerometer s were mounted on the skull. This paper discusses current techniques developed and used by the Biomechanics Group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) for measuring three- dimensional head motion with accelerometer s mounted on the skull. In addition, techniques are also presented for obtaining skull bone strain, epidural pressure, and internal brain motion of repressurized cadavers and Rhesus monkeys during head impact (11-17). The results of several experimental test series (11-14) im- ply potential intractable problems in determin- ing injury criteria, such as the HIC, from ac- celerometer data.

In the experimental design, a stationary test subject is struck by a guided moving impactor. The impactor striking surface is fitted with padding to vary the contact force time-histories. The experimental technique uses: a nine-accelerometer system rigidly affixed to the skull to measure head motion, strain gauges to measure skull bone strain, and transducers placed at specific points below the skull to record epidural pressure. Methods are also discussed for repressurization of both the cadaver vascular and cerebrospinal systems, and for obtaining high-speed cineradiography (at 1000 frames per second) of radiopaque targets in the head to measure the internal motion of the brain. IMPACT TESTING - The methods and procedures used in head injury research at UMTRI are outlined below. Additional information can be found in references (11-17). UMTRI has several impact devices which can have varying mass from 10-65 kg. The Rhesus -cadaver models' test series uses two: the Linear Pendulum Impact Device and the Ballistic Impact Device. Linear Pendulum Impact Device - This device, uses a free-falling pendulum as an energy source, striking either a 25 kg or 56 kg impact piston. The piston is guided by a set of Thomson linear ball bushings. Axial loads are calculated from data recorded using an accelerometer or a load cell. Impact conditions between tests can be controlled by varying impact velocity and the type and depth of padding on the impactor surface. Piston velocity is measured by timing the pulses from a magnetic probe which senses the motion of the targets in the piston. A specially designed timing system is used to control and synchronize the impact events, such as the release of the pendulum and activation and deactivation of the lights and high-speed cameras . Ballistic Impact Device - This device consists of an air reservoir, a ground and honed cylinder, and a carefully fitted piston mechanically coupled to a ballistic pendulum. The piston, propelled by compressed air through the cylinder from the air reservoir chamber, accelerates the ballistic pendulum. The mass of the ballistic pendulum can be varied from 10 to 150 kg. The piston is arrested at the end of its travel allowing the ballistic pendulum to become a free-traveling impactor. The ballistic pendulum is fitted with an inertia-compensated load cell. Nine-Accelerometer Head Plate - For Rhesus subjects, the installation of the nine- accelerometer plate is accomplished as follows. The scalp is removed from the frontal bone over the orbital ridges. Several metal self-tapping screws are attached firmly to the skull through small pilot holes drilled into the orbital ridges and into the hard palate above the canine teeth. Quick-setting acrylic plastic is molded around each of the screws, anchoring the acrylic to the skull. The plate is then set in this acrylic base. For cadavers, the nine-accelerometer plate is installed on the right occipital-parietal area following removal of a two-inch triangular patch of scalp. Four small screws are then inserted in a trapezoidal pattern in the skull within the dimensions of the accelerometer plate mount. Quick setting acrylic plastic is molded around the screws anchoring the acrylic to the skull. The plate is then set in this acrylic base. It is necessary to determine the instrumentation frame's exact location and orientation in relation to the anatomical frame. A three-dimensional x-ray technique is used. This technique requires two orthogonal radiographs of the instrumented head. The procedure requires the identification of the four lead pellets at anatomical landmarks (two superior edges of the auditory meati and two infraorbital notches) with four distinguishable lead pellets, plus the identification of four lead pellets inlaid in the plate to define the instrumentation frame. A similar radiographic technique was used with Rhesus monkeys to determine the orientation and location of the instrumentation frame with respect to the anatomical frame. Rhesus Strain Gauge - Strain gauges are used on the skull bone to record the deformations at specific points during impact for the purpose of estimating their effect on the accelerometer signals. The frontal bone is sanded with 200, then 400 weight wet/dry sandpaper. Two Micro-measurements Type EA-13- 015Y-120 strain gauge rosettes are bonded with M-bond 200 cyanoacrylate adhesive to the surface of the frontal bone, anterior to the Bregma landmark over the sagittal sinus. After the strain gauge wires are soldered to the leads, the rosette and leads are covered and sealed by a coat of M-coat D paint. Quick-setting acrylic plastic is molded around the pressure transducer fitting and nine-accelerometer moorings. When the acrylic is set, the strain gauge wires are strain-relieved by being secured to the nine- accelerometer plate with nylon wire wrap. Epidural Pressure Measurements - Epidural pressures of Rhesus subjects are obtained with a Kulite model MCP-55-5F catheter tip pressure transducer. For cadavers, Endevco series 8510 piezoresistive pressure transducers are used. For Rhesus subjects, a small circle of scalp is removed and a Stryker bone coring tool is used to make a hole in the skull with a circular bit. An adjustable set-screwed collet is used to core into the skull in small increments, preventing damage to the dura mater. The increment of bone 5.89</page><page sequence="3">is then removed using a dental scoop, and the hole is tapped for a coarse thread. A tubular magnesium coupling device is screwed into the tapped hole in the skull. It is anchored into place using quick-setting acrylic plastic molded around the base. Dow Corning dielectric gel (silicon fluid) is injected into the tubing to act as a coupling medium. The Kulite pressure transducer is then inserted and secured at proper depth just above the dura. For cadaver subjects four 1 cm diameter circles of scalp are removed over the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones; a Stryker bone coring tool is used to make four holes in the skull with a circular bit. Holes are placed out of the contact area of the impacting surface and are not drilled into cranial sutures. The dura mater under these holes is perforated without cutting the brain. The holes are tapped and brass transducer couplings are inserted into the tapped holes. Two pinhead screws are attached 2 cm from each transducer. Quick-setting acrylic plastic is molded around the pinhead screws and the sleeve of each transducer coupling as a mooring device. After checking fluid flow, radiopaque gel is injected into the brain through each of the four sleeves. The Endevco series 8510 piezoresistive pressure transducers are then attached to the fittings. Radiopaque Target Gel - A neutral density radiopaque gel is used to determine motion of the brain during impact. The gel is injected into the brain through the holes used for insertion of the pressure transducers. The injection technique produces lines of radio- contrast in the brain that show up in high-speed cineradiographic movies . X-Ray Motion Descriptors - The procedures used for defining x-ray motion are explained in (18) and briefly outlined below. The cineradiograph system allows non-invasive viewing of internal anatomical structure in vivo. In the case of a rigid structure such as bone, the radiopaque targets can be placed on or near anatomical landmarks and motion can be described similarly to that of standard photometric techniques. Problems arise when soft tissue is to be analyzed and rigid body dynamics may no longer offer a good approximation. Several methods could be suggested to produce analytical information describing the soft tissue of the brain. The motion descriptors chosen are based upon the shadows of objects in a two-dimensional image space, produced by a point source of x- rays, which are associated with the anatomical structures or the radiopaque dye injected into the brain. The descriptors are, at most, two- dimensional and do not take into account rotations and translations which move objects in and out of the plane of gross whole body motion. In addition, changes in the x-ray cross-section of objects can lead to changes in the descriptors which do not have a direct relation to rigid body motion. In the impact tests presented in this paper, radiopaque gel was injected into the head producing four curved lines in the brain, outlining the ventricles in some tests. Differential motion between the brain and the skull was obtained by comparing the motion of points on the curve closest to the center of the epidural pressure transducer. General characteristics of brain motion were obtained through the changes in shape of the curved lines and ventricles. Cadaver Vascular Repressurization Pressurization of the cadaver vascular system of the head is accomplished by inserting a balloon catheter through the common carotid artery upwards into the internal carotid artery just above the common carotid bifurcation. A narrow polyethylene tube is inserted at the same point and runs into the internal carotid artery just beyond the balloon. A Kulite pressure transducer is then fed through this tube so that vascular pressure can be monitored. Finally, the vertebral arteries are tied off so that fluid pressure in the head may be maintained. Just prior to testing, a solution of India Ink and saline is injected into the vascular system of the head. A pressure transducer monitors the flow so that the system is brought to normal physiological pressure just prior to impact. Cadaver Cerebrospinal Repressurization - For the cadaver head impacts, the subdural region surrounding the brain and spinal cord is repressurized by coring a small hole into the second lumbar vertebra and inserting a Foley catheter under the dura so that the balloon of the catheter reaches mid-thorax level . To check fluid flow through the ventricles, saline is injected through the Foley catheter until fluid rises to the top of the piezoresistive pressure transducer couplings. The couplings are capped until the radiopaque sodium iodide gel target has been slowly injected through the couplings into the brain cortex and a setup radiograph has been made of the head. The point at which the catheter passes through the lamina of the second lumbar vertebra is sealed with plastic acrylic. Cineradiographs - For selected subjects high-speed cineradiographs are taken of the impact events at either 400 or 1000 frames per second (fps). The UMTRI high-speed cineradiographic system consists of either a Photosonics IB or Miliken high-speed 16 mm motion-picture camera which views a 5 cm diameter output phosphor of a high-gain, four- stage, magnetically focused image intensifier tube, gated on and off synchronously with shutter pulses from the motion-picture camera (19-20). A lens optically couples the input photocathode of the image intensifier tube to x- ray images produced on a fluorescent screen by a smoothed direct-current x-ray generator. 5.90</page><page sequence="4">851244 Smoothing of the full-wave rectified x-ray output is accomplished by placing a pair of high-voltage capacitors in parallel with the x- ray tube. The viewing field for experiments is between 20 and 40 cm. Photokinemetrics - For some tests the motion of the subject is determined from the high-speed film by following the motion of single-point phototargets on the head and on the impactor piston. A Hycam camera operating at 3000 fps provides a close-up lateral view of the impact, while a Photosonics camera provides a lateral 1000 fps overall view. METHODS OF ANALYSIS - As the head moves through space, each point on the head generates a path in space. In head injury research, we are interested in the description of the path of the anatomical center and in events which occur as it moves. A very effective tool for analyzing the motion of this point, as it moves along a curved path in space, is the concept of a moving frame (21-24). The path generated as the point travels through space is a function of time and velocity. A vector field is a function which assigns a uniquely defined vector to each point along a path. Thus, any collection of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors defined on a path is a frame field. Therefore, any vector defined on the path (for example, acceleration) may be resolved into three orthogonal components of any well-defined frame field, such as the laboratory or anatomical reference frames. Changes in a frame field with time (for example, angular acceleration of the frame field) are interpreted as vectors defined on the curve and are also resolved into three components . Frame fields are defined based on anatomical reference frames. Other frame fields such as the Frenet-Serret frame or the Principal Direction Triad, which contain information about the motion embedded in the frame field, have also been used to describe motion resulting from impact (13,25). The Frenet-Serret frame (23-24) consists of three mutually orthogonal vectors T, N, and B. At any point in time a unit vector can be constructed that is co-directional with the velocity vector. This normalized velocity vector defines the tangent direction T. A second unit vector N is constructed by forming a unit vector co-directional with the time derivative of the tangent vector T (the derivative of a unit vector is normal to the vector). To complete the orthogonal frame, a third unit vector B (the unit binormal) can be defined as the cross product T x N. This procedure defines a frame at each point along the path of the anatomical center. Within the frame field, the linear acceleration is resolved into two distinct types. The tangent T is the rate of change of speed (absolute velocity) . The normal acceleration N gives information about the change in direction of the velocity vector. The binormal direction B contains no acceleration information. Transfer Function Analysis - For blunt impacts in biomechanical systems using human surrogates, the relationship between a transducer time-history at a given point and the transducer time-history at another given point can be described in the frequency domain through the use of a transfer function. A fast Fourier transformation of simultaneously monitored time- histories from any two points in the system can be used to define a frequency response function relating the two points. In a case relating a force to a pressure, a transformation of the form: X(iw) = F [F( t ]/F [P(t ) ] can be obtained from the transformed quantities F[F(t)] and F [P( t ) ] , respectively the Fourier transforms of the impact force time-history and the epidural pressure time-history, where w is the given frequency and i implies the complex domain . The transfer function is a complex-valued function which may be described by its magnitude and phase angle. A special form of the transfer function which relates impact force to the resulting velocity of a point is mechanical transfer impedance, defined as: Z(iw) = (w)F[F(t]/F[A(t)] for which w is the chosen frequency and F [F(t ) ] and F [A( t ) ] are Fourier transforms of the impact force and acceleration at the point of interest. Mechanical transfer impedance can also be defined as the ratio between simple harmonic driving force and the corresponding velocity at the point of interest (26). DISCUSSION It has been shown that skull deformation occurs in impacts to human cadavers and that this skull deformation affects both the linear and angular accelerations of the anatomical center. Skull deformation causes local perturbations of the mount that moors the accelerometers to the skull. A second mechanism associated with skull deformation can cause linear and angular accelerations at the center of gravity which are not associated with rigid body motion. In general, the head is modeled as a rigid body when interpreting angular acceleration from nine accelerometers. However, the complex nature of the skull causes asymmetric loading during blunt impact, which leads to an interpretation of an angular acceleration by the nine-accelerometer array that is not directly 5.91</page><page sequence="5">related to rigid body motion (4, 28-30). Therefore, in addition to local skull bending in the area of the nine-accelerometer array, a second mechanism of skull deformation which causes the accelerometers to interpret angular acceleration is hypothesized. A schematic display of this type of response is presented in Figure 1 to illustrate the effect of skull deformation on angular acceleration (a rotation is produced) . The figure demonstrates the type of motion that might occur and is not necessarily representative of motion actually observed. Also, motion of the skull is not necessarily in the anterior -posterior, inferior- superior plane. Because angular displacement is small, movements are best detected through evaluation of angular acceleration. Angular acceleration is an acceleration gradient over displacement at a given instant in time, so the results of the linear acceleration are influenced by the angular acceleration. Thus, the linear acceleration of the "estimated anatomical center" is influenced by the acceleration gradient caused by the angular acceleration. The mechanical impedance corridor of force and tangential acceleration for repressurized cadaver tests in which skull deformation was observed and no skull fracture occurred have been reported previously (14). These impedance values are similar to driving point impedance tests reported by other researchers (15, 31-36). This implies that the skull deformation observed could be related to the same type of skull deformation obtained from such driving point impedance tests. As has been reported skull thickness can have a profound effect on mechanical impedance in terms of resonances and anti-resonances (14). It is clear from previous head impact studies that rigid body motion as well as computations in which rigid body dynamics are assumed (such as HIC calculation) are in question (11,14,15). One possible solution to this problem is to filter the data in such a way that skull deformation does not show up in accelerometer measurements. Figure 2 is an example of the tangential acceleration and resultant linear and angular acceleration for an impact to a human cadaver in which skull deformation without fracture was observed. The figure represents five different Butterworth 4th order filters for the same test and shows the effect of filtering on the accelerometer time-history. Accelerations filtered at channel class 1000 can be seen to produce maximum values for both linear and angular accelerations, as well as maximum HIC. Minimum HIC in the test presented in the figure occurs when the data is preprocessed with a 100 Hz Butterworth filter. The following observations have been made of head impact data collected at UMTRI using nine accelerometers affixed to the skull and presented elsewhere (11,14,15). 1. There are at least two resonances that occur in transfer functions derived from acceleration, obtained by accelerometers mounted on the skull, and from force. These resonances are believed to be related to the bending modes of the skull. The resonances occur at 600-800 Hz and 1200-1500 Hz. ^ 1Ď /V ^ ^ / 'i i Anatomical Centae ļ Ď !

In most cases the HIC calculated at the anatomical center is smaller (sometimes by as much as a factor of 2) from the HIC calculated at the skull surface. 3. Skull deformation implies that rigid body motion dynamics can be used only in a limited sense when analyzing "severe head impacts." 4. Filtering can be an effective method of reducing the effect of skull deformation on linear and angular acceleration. The following observations have been made about the effect of filtering acceleration time- histories on the three-dimensional motion predicted by a nine-accelerometer array mounted on the skull. 1. Channel Class 1000 allows both the first and the second resonances of the skull to affect the linear and angular accelerations of most impacts. 2. Filtering a raw accelerometer time- history using an 800 Hz Butterworth 4th order filter allows only the first resonance to affect the accelerometer time-history. 3. Unless the skull is "thin" a 400 Hz Butterworth 4th order filter eliminates the effect of skull deformation on impact response and the motion of the skull is primarily rigid body motion. 4. Filtering affects the HIC calculation but does not alter it greatly until the accelerations are filtered below 400 Hz. The results illustrated in this paper extend the studies of the kinematic response of non-human primates and cadavers to blunt impacts (11,15). The earlier reports showed some of the differences in kinematic response between these two models to be attributable to two factors: the soft tissue distribution, and skull geometry (27). CONCLUSIONS AND OBSERVATIONS Three-dimensional rigid body motion is not well defined in a "severe head impact" when using accelerometers located on the skull. The acceleration time-histories, including the resultant acceleration used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) of the anatomical center, depends not only on where the accelerometers have been placed on the skull but also on the biovariability of the test subject's skull. It may be possible to interpret human cadaver head acceleration in such a way that it can be more readily compared to Anthropomorphic Test Devices. It is recommended that a Butterworth 400 Hz 4th order filter be used on the raw accelerometer time-history. Because the filtering affects the HIC, the threshold of 1000 may need to be re-examined.
