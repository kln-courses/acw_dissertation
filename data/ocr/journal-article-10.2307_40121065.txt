The third volume of the richly gifted author who, not yet in his middle twenties, was the literary revelation of 1964 shows more man- nerisms and more yielding to verbal intem- perance than Le proces-verbal and especially than La fievre, that amazingly skillful and moving collection of short stories. The begin- ning and the end of the novel could have been dispensed with to advantage. The obscurity which shrouds the story of Besson, a young man obsessed with the unreality and the false- ness of life and more than half in love with death, seems more a series of devices than essential to the originality of the narrative. The deluge of words, reminiscent of Giono and Celine, drowns the reader. The philoso- phy of nothingness implied by the narrative is by now a little too familiar. But many pages display an extraordinary verbal mastery and a gift of anthropomorphic poetry which is a relief from some of the geo-</page><page sequence="2">FRENCH: FICTION 425 metric and ascetic "new novels." The decom- position of the city (presumably of Nice, where the author lives) under a pelting and melting rain is paralleled by that of the anti- heroic hero. He listens to the tape on which a girl who decided to die recorded her lengthy, rambling farewell. He abandons his mother, his familiar possessions, a woman who tried for a time to surround him with devotion. He enters a church and confesses, only to realize that his faith also is dead. After twelve days of that despair and of torrential rain, Besson walks to a beach as a scorching sun has suc- ceeded the deluge. He will perhaps choose life against suicide. But he has pierced through all appearances and substituted a monstrous visionary world for the real one. Le Clezio, born of an English father and living away from the literary cafes, is an extraordinary manipulator of words and awk- ward when he turns philosophical or symbolic. But his perception of reality through agile and direct sensations and his visionary power to force his images and nightmares upon us is uncanny. His vocation was to be a painter; but he realized early that his gifts lay else- where. He wrote a university essay on Henri Michaux, probably read a good deal of Blake and of Bachelard. His success does not appear to have spoiled him. In an interview given last May to L'Express, he proclaimed, most unfashionably, that he believed "a writer should be a moralist . . . One cannot write well ... if one does not entertain a lofty notion of what a human being is." Henri Peyre Yale University</page></plain_text>
