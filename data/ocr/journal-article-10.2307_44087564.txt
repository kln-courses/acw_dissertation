<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAN W Y L I E The Anthropomorphic Ethic Fiction and the Animal Mind in Virginia Woolf 's Flush and Barbara Gowdy's The White Bone It is a well-established fact that the complexity of the mental pro- cesses of animals is apt to be exaggerated even by professional psy- chologists , and this , though civilization , or perhaps rather educa- tion , has brought with it a sense of the great gulf that exists between man and the lower animals , not excluding those to which excep- tional intelligence is , rightly or wrongly , attributed , such as the el- ephant and the anthropoid ape. - Northcote W. Thomas, 1908 Northcote Thomas implies that the role of the "professional psycholo- gist" or educator should be to prove the lack of complexity in the ani- mal "mental processes." In contrast, researchers have come a long way since 1908 in establishing close genetic kinship between humans and apes, postulating more and more startling language abilities in dol- phins and chimps, and reporting on what appear to be recognizable cultures amongst dogs and elephants. This kind of research has had the effect of calling increasingly into question conventional distinctions between "human" and "animal." Rationality, language, self-awareness, consciousness of death, prob- lem-solving, altruism, play: all these and other traits have been singled out as marking the distinctively "human." All have to some extent been eroded. Of course, no one is seriously arguing that humans are the same as dogs or elephants. But research in these cognitive border- lands is raising the possibility that recognizing a degree of kinship be- Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 9.2 (Summer 2002) Copyright Â© 2002 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">116 ISLE tween species has certain, sometimes radical, implications for the eth- ics of our treatment of other "sentient beings." In some ways, the problem is an extension of the "problem of other minds." Bertrand Russell's formulation has proved controversial, but remains serviceable: "As it is clear to me that the causal laws govern- ing my behavior have to do with 'thoughts/ it is natural to infer that the same is true of the analogous behavior of my friends" (89). We translate the visible or audible signs, and we imagine. In short, we construct a fiction about what is happening in that "other mind," upon which we base our own responses.1 To do so, I want to suggest here, has unavoidable ethical implications. The role of the imagination seems dramatically missing from those discussions I have read. Kant's dismissal - the imagination is merely "a hidden art in the depths of the soul whose true devices nature will scarcely let us divine" (qtd. in Brann 32) - is emblem- atically vague. "Nature," in contrast, is seen precisely as that which is rationalistically explicable, and clearly divorced from human "cul- ture." Hence, as Marian Scholtmeijer writes, "As soon as language begins to articulate the vital inner experience of animals, the suspi- cion arises that culture is learning more about itself than about ani- mals per se. Anthropomorphism has become one of the great anxi- eties of the modern age" (89).2 Fiction writers nevertheless persist in using the imagination as a viable tool in expressing kinship with non-human beings in ways unavailable to either conventional phi- losophy or neurological science. The works examined here are only two in a long tradition of fictions purporting to enter the animal mind, ranging from Jack London's White Fang (1906) to Paul Auster's Timbuktu (2000). The anthropomorphism in such works is not simplistic. These writ- ers are fully, even painfully aware of the linguistic limitations under which such an enterprise labors.3 Yet the effort, risking the charge of "sentimentalism" from the rationalists, is apparently worth repeat- ing, especially in our era of ecological climacteric, in which our treat- ment of the non-human has become so evidently unsustainable. To anthropomorphize, in a crucial sense, is to do no more than what we do with one another.4 It is a kind of metaphor, and metaphor, as Northrop Frye pointed out, captures "a desire to associate, and finally to identify, the human mind with what goes on outside it" (qtd. in Evernden, "Beyond" 101).5 Even though, as we shall see, limits re- main, anthropomorphic writing nevertheless seems to embody the proposition that animals - or at least certain animals - are in some sense understandable, and have enough in common with us to demand an ethically equivalent response and sense of responsibility from humans.</page><page sequence="3">The Anthropomorphic Ethic 117 Perhaps the best way into the problem is by way of examples of what writers actually do. In extending the brief discussion above to a detailed examination of Flush and The White Bone , I want to focus on four central aspects: the translation of sensory experience; the place of self-consciousness; consciousness of death; and the narrative situation. Woolf on Spaniels Virginia Woolf 's relatively little-known novella Flush is cast as the bi- ography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's spaniel - and so as an inge- nious side-light on Browning herself. The story is spun out of a few scattered references in Browning's work and letters. Much of Flush's fame, such as it is, relates to the fact that he was the "sole witness" (Burdett 58) of Barrett's meetings with her future husband, Robert Browning. The real pivot of Woolf 's novel is the imaginative recreation of the meeting of two poetic minds. It is clearly, as Kate Flint has pointed out, a way of highlighting various gender and class issues which Woolf also treats elsewhere: "as Woolf so ably shows us, the overlooked and underrated perspective of a dog may be uncannily close to the under- rated perspective of the thinking Victorian woman" (Woolf xliii). But the use of the spaniel's perspective seems more than merely instru- mental or allegorical. Woolf also seems interested in the actuality of an animal's consciousness. To the limit of the linguistic, fictional form, she grapples with a dog's different sensory capability: For the first time the whole battery of a London street on a hot summer's day assaulted his nostrils. He smelt the swooning smells that lie in the gutters; the bitter smells that corrode iron railings; the fuming, heady smells that rise from basements - smells more complex, corrupt, violently con- trasted and compounded than any he had smelt in the fields near Read- ing. . . . (30) The metaphoric quality of Woolf 's adjectives - swooning , bitter, corrupt - enact a kind of "translative imagining," as well as an ineradicable duality. The analogies of Russell's argument are barely beneath the surface.6 Pace Evernden and Frye, metaphor, whatever its reach, also signifies the truism that "a visual [or olfactory] percept cannot be re- covered from a [verbal] description" (Brann 466). But for us there is only the trying. Here is a more obvious example: Only a scholar who has descended step by step into a mausoleum and there finds himself in a crypt, crusted with fungus, slimy with mould, ex-</page><page sequence="4">118 ISLE uding sour smells of decay and antiquity . . . - only the sensations of such an explorer into the buried vaults of a ruined city can compare with the riot of emotions that flooded Flush's nerves as he stood for the first time in an invalid's bedroom. . . . (23) Alongside, or rather imbricating, the firm statement of equivalence - " only this can compare" - is the necessary failure of the imagination to be Flush (who is here reduced to a bundle of "nerves"). Analogy is powerful, but continues to underline difference. More important, it's one-way: the power of analogy flows only from the writer to reader; it is still, necessarily, translated into terms wholly foreign to the dog. Flush could never, in reverse, compare his own experience to that of crypt-exploring scholar. A similar process of translation is happening in the following, where the dog's nose-level experience of being in long grass is re-coded in the world of human manufacture, a curtain: As she strode through the long grass, so he leapt hither and thither, part- ing its green curtain. The cool globes of dew or rain broke in showers of iridescent spray about his nose; the earth, here hard, here soft, here hot, here cold, stung, teased and tickled the soft pads of his feet. Then what a variety of smells interwoven in subtlest combination thrilled his nostrils; strong smells of earth, sweet smells of flowers; nameless smells of leaf and bramble; sour smells as they crossed the road; pungent smells as they entered bean-fields. But suddenly down the wind came tearing a smell sharper, stronger, more lacerating than any - a smell that ripped across his brain stirring a thousand instincts, releasing a million memo- ries - the smell of hare, the smell of fox. Off he flashed like a fish drawn in a rush through water further and further. He forgot his mistress; he forgot all human kind. (11) Compared to the other example cited above, the adjectives seem generalized and thin, at least until we get to "lacerating." They would hardly do justice to the richness and nuance even of human scent. And what scent, to a dog, could possibly be "nameless"? Woolf means, presumably, previously unencountered; but the for- mulation implies that it's not yet attached to a cognitive system couched in terms or faculties other than scent - as if scent were not enough. Here is the underlying presumption: that only linguistic naming is adequate to recognizable cognition. This raises, of course, the question of what counts as "language"; scientific investigation of this area remains primitive (Hauser), and anthropomorphic fic- tions expend great effort translating body language, for instance, into human-linguistic meanings. This is connected to another presumption, captured in the last lines of the quotation, that such scent-based cognition is connected with the</page><page sequence="5">The Anthropomorphic Ethic 119 baser instincts. Flush becomes a "brain" rather than a mind; he be- comes assimilated to a "lower" form of life, a fish. He succumbs to an irresistible urge - consisting partly, interestingly, of a kind of collec- tive unconscious. Moreover, this instinctual urgency, and its close alli- ance with sensory acuity, is precisely that which is opaque or lost to the human: Why, Miss Barrett wondered, did Flush tremble suddenly, and whim- per and start and listen? She could hear nothing; she could see noth- ing; there was nobody in the room with them. She could not guess that Folly, her sister's little King Charles, had passed the door; or that Catiline the Cuba bloodhound had been given a mutton-bone by a foot- man in the basement. But Flush knew; he heard; he was ravaged by the alternate rages of lust and greed. Then with all her poet's imagina- tion Miss Barrett could not divine what Wilson's wet umbrella meant to Flush; what memories it recalled, of forests and parrots and wild trum- peting elephants. . . . (26, my emphasis) So is Woolf 's imagination somehow superior to Barrett's, that she can imagine what is happening in Flush's sensory-world? Not really: Woolf is still relating only the consequences of that sensory acuteness, not the acuteness itself. It still has to be translated into human terms: The human nose is practically non-existent. The greatest poets in the world have smelt nothing but roses on the one hand, and dung on the other. The infinite gradations that lie between are unrecorded. Yet it was in the world of smell that Flush mostly lived. Love was chiefly smell; form and colour were smell; music and architecture, law, poli- tics and science were smell. (86) While reformulating the dog's sensory world in complexly mod- ern human terms, Woolf also alludes a number of times to the in- stinct to rejoin the wild. When Flush dreams, it is (Woolf imagines) of ferns and forests (26, 70). When his emotions are at their highest pitch, Woolf couches them in "natural" terms: "He pursued his in- vestigations, cautiously, nervously, as an explorer in a forest softly advances his foot, uncertain whether that shadow is a lion, or that root a cobra" (17). This inward survival of the primitive (even spe- cifically of the African!) is contrasted with a parallel urge to, as it were, climb the evolutionary ladder, to become human - or at least there is an effort on Woolf 's part to close the gap between rational- ity and instinct. This wars with an insistence that dogs are differ- ent, and nowhere more so than in the realm of language. Woolf portrays the first meeting between the "pale worn" Elizabeth Barrett and Flush, "instinct with health and energy": "Broken asunder, yet</page><page sequence="6">120 ISLE made in the same mould, could it be that each completed what was dormant in the other? She might have been - all that; and he - But no. Between them lay the widest gulf that can separate one being from another. She spoke. He was dumb" (18-19). The paradox is not, in Woolf 's view, entirely hopeless: The fact was that they [Barrett and Flush] could not communicate with words, and it was a fact that led undoubtedly to much misunderstand- ing. Yet did it not lead also to a peculiar intimacy? "Writing," Miss Barrett once exclaimed after a morning's toil, "writing, writing . . . After all, she may have thought, do words say everything? Can words say anything? Do not words destroy the symbol that lies beyond the reach of words? (27) She may have thought. The omniscient narrator of the narrative here steps back a little, almost as if she is in Flush's space, unable to make that ineffable connection with an "other mind." And if, as Woolf inti- mates here, language inevitably fails us, masking as much as it re- veals, there are other modes of communication, equally important. In a paradoxical way, it takes the imagining of the spaniel point-of-view to make this clear: Though [Flush] could make no sense of the little words that hurtled over his head from two-thirty to four-thirty sometimes three times a week, he could detect with terrible accuracy that the tone of the words was changing. . . . Her voice fluttered; hesitated; seemed to falter and fade and plead and gasp, as if she were begging for a rest, for a pause, as if she were afraid. (40-41) As if. This is now Flush imagining, postulating, reasoning, classifying. Or rather, "Flush," which is to say, Woolf 's verbal reconstruction of imagined doggy "thoughts" which make up the entity recognizable as Flush. Even this reconstruction must be based on observations that dogs appear (from certain reactions humans have noted, translated, and experimented with) to have an exceptional sensitivity to human emotion.7 These cross-fertilizing imaginings are deft, but remain philo- sophically problematic. Despite being fully aware of the dog-human language-barrier, then, Woolf demonstrates a countervailing desire to assimilate Flush to the human. Like a human, the spaniel is educatable. His flesh becomes "veined with human passions" (88). It is part of the gift of omniscient narration to deceive us momentarily that we have - just for a moment - perceived as the dog perceives. This can verge on the comical:</page><page sequence="7">The Anthropomorphic Ethic 121 Such an education as this, in the back bedroom at Wimpole Street, would have told upon an ordinary dog. And Flush was not an ordinary dog. He was high-spirited, yet reflective; canine, but highly sensitive to human emotions also. . . . We cannot blame him if his sensibility was cultivated rather to the detriment of his sterner qualities. Naturally, lying with his head pillowed on a Greek lexicon, he came to dislike barking and biting; he came to prefer the silence of the cat to the robustness of the dog; and human sympathy to either. (32) Woolf teeters between essentializing terms like "canine" and "ordi- nary," and a desire to recognize individuation in the animal. She bal- ances between qualities instinctually ingrained, those it is possible to "osmote" from one's surroundings and thereby become qualitatively different, and those gained by becoming "reflective." Woolf, of course, doesn't believe that Flush is really becoming more intelligent by rest- ing his head on a Greek lexicon, and she comments with wry humor on such human efforts to communicate. This passage continues: Miss Barrett, too, did her best to refine and educate his powers still further. Once she took a harp from the window and asked him, as she laid it by his side, whether he thought that the harp, which made music, was itself alive? He looked and listened; pondered, it seemed, for a moment in doubt and then decided it was not. Then she would make him stand with her in front of the looking-glass and ask him why he barked and trembled. Was not that the little brown dog opposite himself? But what is "oneself"? Is it the thing people see? Or is it the thing one is? So Flush pondered that question too, and, unable to solve the problem of reality, pressed closer to Miss Barrett and kissed her "expressively." That was real at any rate. (32) Woolf 's insertion of "it seemed," and the scare-quotes around "ex- pressively" signal the tongue in the cheek. Woolf seems to have forgotten that earlier she has portrayed Flush, as he ponders the class structures of London dogdom, quite deliberately "self-reflect- ing": "Which was he, then [high dog or low dog]? No sooner had Flush got home than he examined himself carefully in the looking- glass. Heaven be praised, he was a dog of birth and breeding!" (23). Flush is again portrayed as having assimilated certain human judge- ments of class and breeding - eyes which are "prominent but not gozzled," feathered paws, drinking from a purple jar - and taking an active pride in them. At this point, it might well be objected, that Woolf is anthropo- morphizing to an illegitimate extent. This is where examination of the narrative mode - the third-person, omniscient narrative stance - becomes so important. The level of satire and distance it involves is sometimes - as in the previous example - difficult to judge. Woolf</page><page sequence="8">122 ISLE balances cannily between taking advantage of the freedom of this fictional mode to hint at an alternative world of sense and sensibil- ity, and reflecting on the limits of its imaginative possibilities. On the one hand, as she imagines Flush imagining, she enacts a real sense of community and reciprocity: in this sense, then, the choice of narrative mode and the nature of the "translation" is an ethical statement. On the other hand, Woolf is keenly aware that some dif- ferences between human and beast remain intractable, untranslat- able. The adoption of a third-person mode is an enactment of an unbridgeable outside-ness. The underlying sense is, though, that this does not matter. It is the imagining itself which is the vital stuff of community. The imagining happening on the page is as "real" an expression of a new kind of society - inclusive of dogs and humans - as the pressure of Flush's flank against his mistress's leg. The issue is not whether or not anthro- pomorphizing is "true," but that it is both imaginatively possible and fruitful. Everything Woolf writes in this novella hinges on the percep- tion that only through the imagination can we forge "right relation- ship." To imagine is to love. This is the ethic of anthropomorphism. While Flush's momentary reversion to certain savage ancestries may, as Flint argues, reinforce a certain antipathy towards the brutality of Nature in Woolf's writings, there are also sparks of a certain utopianism. Flush is portrayed, in rhetoric breathless with loss, as ca- pable of a purity of emotion which "men can never know - love pure, love simple, love entire; love that brings no train of care in its wake; that has no shame; no remorse; that is here, that is gone, as the bee on the flower is here and is gone" (78-79). It may be too idealistic to say, with the elephant character Torrent in Barbara Gowdy's The White Bone , that what is "once envisioned . . . is obliged to transpire" (82). But it is not merely whimsical. Without imagining, nothing transpires. Anthropomorphizing in this way - within the radical other- world of fiction - may be scientifically dubi- ous8 and philosophically unprovable, but it holds up a mirror which is absolutely necessary to our existence. Flush (and Flush the novella) is our mirror. Re-visioning the Wild Virginia Woolf wrote in an essay for the Guardian in 1904: There is something . . . profane in the familiarity, half contemptuous, with which we treat our animals. We deliberately transplant a little bit of simple wild life, and make it grow up beside ours, which is neither</page><page sequence="9">The Anthropomorphic Ethic 123 simple nor wild . . . How have we the impertinence to make these wild creatures forego their nature for ours, which at best they can but imi- tate? (Flush xl-xli) With Barbara Gowdy's The White Bone the problematic issue of "domestic" as opposed to "wild" does not arise - or at least not di- rectly. In this ambitious, poetic, and epic novel, we are wholly (or al- most wholly) in the realm of the wild, of the East African elephant. The novel is an attempt to envisage an elephant society from the inside; the primary focus is not on human-elephant interaction, but on el- ephant-elephant relations. A complete society is recreated, on a scale reminiscent of Richard Adams's Watership Down. These elephants pos- sess myths, song cycles, ancestral maps of prodigious memory, com- plex kinship networks, means of measurement, highly evolved com- munication systems, and individual characters as nuanced as any hu- mans. The story follows the well-worn path of the epic search, in the face of all-but-insurmountable difficulties, for the archetypal utopia, a final Safe Place. The primary focus on one crippled orphan, Mud, is as calculated to evoke sympathy as Dickens's creation of Oliver Twist. A search is instituted for a mythical "white bone," the divination of which will indicate the right direction. Mud's primary hostiles are drought and humans. In another sense, of course, "domestication" (through translation into human language) is exactly to the point. Is this fictional portrayal, for all its eloquence, not another "impertinence"? Is Gowdy's fictional imagining not another way of making "wild creatures forego their nature for ours"? What are the ethics of this "translation" of what is clearly some thorough research into elephant behavior into human terms? Can this anthropomorphizing have ethical value? Spaniels are one thing. It is a different prospect extending the no- tion of a "society" to embrace the wild. It has much wider implica- tions for environmental ethics. Gowdy's strategy is, firstly, to depict an elephant society as complex and wonderful as the human, in order to have it accorded equal respect. Secondly, she relates with shocking and graphic economy the depredations of ivory-hunters: the novel is almost unremittingly a series of such massacres, with barely a hint of hope at the close. Even the portrayal of people sympathetic to elephants is ridiculed: the elephants find the idea of humans sitting in their "slid- ers" (vehicles) for hours just staring at them quite mystifying and ri- diculous. In short, the underpinning call in the novel seems to be some- thing like, "Elephants are awfully like us: just leave them alone." In a Prologue of ambiguous provenance - ambiguous in that it seems authorial but pretends an inside knowledge that only an el-</page><page sequence="10">124 ISLE ephant could "know" - Gowdy courts the "sentimentality" that both the scientist and Jack London disavow. After an extended, poetic medi- tation on the nature of elephants' memory, she writes: Suppose, off to one side, waves of salt dust had swirled up from the pan. In memory, they [the elephants] can turn their gaze on the waves and pon- der this phenomenon of a lake bed dreaming its lost lake. Which may start them weeping. To a degree we would call maudlin they are sentimental: even the big bulls are. Any kind of loss or yearning breaks their hearts. (2) There's a hint here of an underlying feminist agenda, echoing Woolf 's. The point of view is matriarchal. As one cow-character puts it to Mud: "A bull ... is merely the digger. You are the dug. You are the altered one" (5). "Feminine" sentiment is one aspect for which Gowdy seems actively to call as part of a human and humane response. Loss and yearning - in our case for lost elephants and wilderness - is the foun- dation of this fiction. Still, there are three main features that rescue the story from being no more than an extended exercise in sentiment (which is to say, it has harsh things to tell us humans about ourselves). Being awfully like us also means, for Gowdy, being capable of some awful mistakes. Not all elephants are equally pleasant, or equally percipient, or equally truth- ful. On the one hand, then, Gowdy wants to see elephants, like Flush, as being in possession of faculties which humans could well do with, which humans are seen to have lost. Amongst these are not only smell, hearing, and infrasonic communication,9 but visionary and telepathic qualities as well. On the other hand, not all elephants are endowed with the latter: they are specialties, half-inherited, half-learned and refined through use. Gowdy doesn't go quite as far as Ursula le Guin, whose other-worldly characters in The Left Hand of Darkness "mind- speak," and so eliminate lying altogether. All these elephant charac- ters' abilities suffer limits of range, acuteness, interpretative accuracy, self-deception and deception of others. Secondly, then, the elephants are not uncomplicatedly attuned to each other, or to other creatures around them, in some kind of Utopian "balance of nature." The elephants at times manage to com- municate with eagles and mongooses, but drought, snakes, hyenas, and deceitful cheetahs present a variety of threats. And it's not clear, at the novel's close, whether or not the Safe Place towards which the mythology entices them, really exists. It may be that this great myth, so central to elephantine belief, is no more than another of those ineffective superstitions which are revealed as such in the course of the novel.10</page><page sequence="11">The Anthropomorphic Ethic 125 A third factor which diminishes sentimentality is the density of observation of actual elephant behavior.11 Rather like R. G. Collingwood's famous historian, thinking his way into the mind be- hind his subject's actions (see also Heal), Gowdy takes otherwise in- decipherable movements of body and vocal effects, readily observ- able amongst elephants anywhere, and interprets them as coherent components of a communicable and communicative culture.12 A pas- sage or two will serve as illustrations. The first encapsulates several issues, including the relationship of body- and verbal language, self- consciousness, and consciousness of death. Four times [She-Demands] steps on her dead newborn. She kicks sand over the remains, walks to where the sand is dryer and blows two trunkfuls over herself. Her daughters and Hail Stones go to her as the rest of the She- S cows start moving out of the swamp, and She-Scares - who watched the spectacle from up on the bank- slides on her haunches down to the shore and herself kicks sand over the body. "Mud," She-Demands says. Mud is coming out of the water a little behind her family, who now surround and sniff the corpse. Surprised at being singled out, she nudges her way through the big cows until she is in front of the She-D matriarch. She-Demands used to be one of the more forbidding cows, famous for her spiritual sermons and the wideness of her head. Now her head slings for- ward from her shoulders and is so deflated that Mud wonders how it is possible she scented the hyena. Temporin leaks down her face, and re- spectfully Mud touches the exudate and then slips her trunk into the old cow's mouth but quickly withdraws at the stench of despair and decaying molars. She-Demands dips her head to look at her. In those milky eyes, behind whatever accretions of misery have killed all expression, Mud sees the glitter of a cow alight with vision. . . . She turns to look at She-Sees, who also has the third eye, and the old cow looks back at her and mutters, "Knowing things is only a dream of having known them." (36-37) Some elephant motions here, seemingly mere observation, gain reso- nance from context. Others are "translated": the significance attached to the width and attitude of the head, the temporin stream from the gland behind the eye, the motions of Mud's trunk. Even the scientific biologist might not have too much trouble with that epithet, "respect- fully." Nor would she be likely to be troubled by the conceptualization of matriarchal hierarchies as such, or with the observation that el- ephants do pay particular attention to elephant remains, indicating at least some kind of consciousness of death.13 The crucial break-point is of course where Gowdy spills over into fantasy - that is, strong anthropomorphism - and imagines the linea- ments of a hugely complex culture which might "explain" these em-</page><page sequence="12">126 ISLE pirically observable actions. The naming, the "verbal" conversations, the attribution of the "third eye" of preternatural vision (obviously taken from human mysticism): these seem, to say the least, improb- able. Elephants don't speak English. But it's at precisely such points that Gowdy makes her most profound observations on the nature of knowing, imagining, being. Date Bed looks back, blinking. Eventually she closes her eyes, lifts her trunk and scents a place between Mud's eyes. Mud doesn't question the oddness of this. It occurs to her that Date Bed may be trying to listen beyond what she, Mud, is thinking. To the source of the visions, perhaps, the pulse or clot that allows Mud to see into the distance. She finds herself remembering something Torrent said, years ago, about nothing wanting substance until it is envisioned. "Once envi- sioned," he said, "it is obliged to transpire" - and she wonders whether, by staring at Date Bed and imagining the two of them leaving Blood Swamp together, she is forcing substance upon her, fixing her in some way that removes possible futures. . . . She feels remotely observed, which almost certainly means that she is living a moment seen by some other visionary (and that the moment is of consequence), but it is also possible that she herself is the observer of the moment. (81-82) It is impossible not to see this passage as a meditation upon Gowdy's own larger project. She is imagining - giving substance to - a particu- lar kind of society, a particular kind of hope. Importantly, Gowdy, unlike London or Woolf, does not hesitate to attribute "mind," "think- ing," and self-awareness to the elephants: their "kind have never doubted that who they see when they see themselves in water is them- selves" (166). Interestingly, as in Woolf, a mirror provides the occasion for a deeper meditation on selfhood, thought, and spirit. The elephant Date Bed picks up an abandoned wing-mirror: Cradling it in her trunk, she looks at herself. "There is not a single sharp stone in this vicinity," she says. Her eye blinks. The dark circle in the cen- tre contracts to a dot and her sense is that the reason for the contraction is so that the eye may fetch an idea from within itself. And here it comes, the idea, leaping from the image of her eve into her actual eye and from there into her head where she hears, "Use the Thing." (166) This marvelous figuring of the ability to be self-aware (never mind whether the ability belongs to an elephant or to Barbara Gowdy) is then extended into possibilities for communication, and into possi- bilities of spirit: even the canny Date Bed isn't certain that her reflec- tion "isn't a guardian" (168). At the same time, Gowdy inserts a doubt: is the paranormal "feeling" Mud experiences in the previous passage</page><page sequence="13">The Anthropomorphic Ethic 127 not an operation of some other aspect of her "self"? It's a statement of an irreducible solipsism at the heart of the imaginative act. That said, Gowdy's demand on suspension of disbelief is a heavy one. The tongue-in-cheek tone of Woolf 's novella is absent here. Ev- erything depends on what one makes of this serious realism. It needs to be noted, for a start, that despite her stylistic finesse, Gowdy is still, like Woolf, not breaking fully into her animal's "mind." Though the internalization is more sustained than Woolf 's, Gowdy is still work- ing in the third-person, and does not focalize entirely through Mud. In some ways, she seems to be approaching the problem like an an- thropologist: she prefaces the book with maps, genealogical tables, a glossary.14 This is also the impression given by the occasional explana- tory footnotes, the equipment of the "objective" outsider, the scholar. However, often the footnotes seem to slide, as if the compiler is also an elephant. This echoes the ambiguity of the Prologue. For example, to the assertion of some old cows that "There have always been hindleggers [humans]," the footnote is appended: An exaggeration. There have been humans since the Descent, which took place ten thousand years ago, during the first long drought, when a starving bull and cow killed and ate a gazelle and in so doing broke the first and most sacred law: "You shall eat no creature, living or dead." Even before the two miscreants had finished their meal they began to shrink. . . . They rose up on their hind legs to protest but only a weak howl came from their throats. . . . (Gowdy 7n) While that first sentence seems to indicate an outsider to elephant so- ciety, the rest relates the "creation myth" without gloss or demurral, as if it's being offered by another elephant of superior knowledge. This kind of fudging suffuses the main text, too. While elephants appar- ently think of humans as "hindleggers," they are also frequently termed "humans." "Sliders" are also "vehicles," "The Web" is also a "fence," and so on. This is the duality - the dialectic, it might be said - of trans- lative imagining making itself felt. In this oscillation lies the potential for both empathy (and the text does work empathetically; it's a very moving book) and a mirroring critique of human society itself. This supports Neil Evernden's insistence that the creation of "Nature," of the wild, is also, simultaneously, unavoidably, the creation of the "hu- man," a dynamic at once liberating and entrapping: "For the human- ist concept of 'Human' to exist, we must first invent Nature: our free- dom rests on the bondage of nature to the 'Laws' which we prescribe" (Social 60) . To recognize the dialectic is therefore to confront the ethi- cal issues embedded in the narrative - such as, in the footnote quoted above, the charming notion that humans were once elephants, obey-</page><page sequence="14">128 ISLE ing prohibitions on killing which constituted the original moral state. While this recognizable "humanlike" narrative, the convention of the creation-myth, carries moral import, it imposes a certain limitation on that import: we can legitimately lump it with other patently "untrue" human creation myths. But this is in no way to diminish its ethical dimension. Indeed, it is to enhance, even to constitute it. Both Woolf and Gowdy imply that the ethical dimension, which scientific meth- odology so assiduously attempts to exorcise (see Hauser 211), depends fundamentally on the imagining of "other minds." Conclusion I've posed more questions than I can answer. But I have suggested that fictional representations of the animal "mind" are not different in kind, in some respects, from the predictive simulation we perform in our interactions with each other. I have also suggested, as Woolf and Gowdy seem to do, that such anthropomorphic imagining is necessar- ily an ethical act. There are limits. One limit is language itself. Another is the nature of the beast being written about: bat, or dog, or elephant. Dog-human community happens. Elephant-human society also hap- pens, on a more limited scale. But this is not the community which Gowdy, at least, postulates. Rather, it seems to be a notion of cultural respect itself which is important. At the same time, both authors push towards what Scholtmeijer identifies as an ideal: "a conception of ani- mals as animals which finds ethical significance in their own state of being" (69). It is arguable that, things being what they are, Woolf and Gowdy have failed to accord animals entirely their "own state of be- ing." Neither, however, does a "scientific," behaviorist, "mental pro- cesses" approach. It is not so much that scientific empiricism is ethi- cally innocent; that is an illusion. It is that, in fiction, ethics becomes a foregrounded component of the narrative as soon as the imagining of cultural norms is expressed. If imagining creates self-awareness, it accords selfhood to others, too, whether or not the imagining is "true" in any empirically verifiable sense. It is to extend the range of possible contexts within which a "self" is necessarily constructed - imagined, if you like. As She-Sees says in the passage quoted earlier, "Knowing things is only a dream of having known them." Images are the propo- sition. If one accepts that, then imagining is necessarily the creation of culture. Gowdy's imagining of an elephant culture not only throws a backlight on our own, compelling us to question our own myths, su- perstitions, means of communication, funerary rites, familial relations, eating habits. It proposes the acceptance of an ethical sense of commu- nity - rather than a community - between human and elephant. It</page><page sequence="15">The Anthropomorphic Ethic 129 implies, finally, to quote Alberto Manguei, the sense of "a responsibil- ity which extends far beyond the limits of the translated page" (123). NOTES 1. For accessible discussion of the "problem of other minds/' see David M. Rosenthal's collection, The Nature of Mind (1991). A more recent philo- sophical turn, simulation theory, doesn't seem to me to go much further than an elaboration of Russell's theory of analogy. What it may offer, however, is a manner of talking about the imagination as non-rational and at least partly non-empirical. What I simulate in my mind in order to offer a prediction about the behavior of another need not, in this view, be predicated on an empirically-based theory of behavior. It leaves space for what Heal calls "thought radicals" (89). Though Heal doesn't take her discussion into this area, this at least begins to philosophize the operation of actively, if not ex nihilo, creating a parallel "world" in fictional mode. She goes no way at all into the problem of putting this into an ethical framework. See also Goldman. My thanks are due especially to Tom Martin and David Ryan for discussion on drafts of this paper. 2. This is the case even amongst some environmentalists, such as Jhan Hochman: "I believe or at least hope that most environmentalists and ani- mal-rights advocates ... do not think of themselves as ventriloquists putting words into the mouths of (dumb) animals" (190). 3. One can scarcely avoid mentioning Thomas Nagel's famous essay, "What is It Like to Be a Bat?" in this regard (in Hofstadter and Dennett). 4. Anthropomorphism, as Thomas Nagel has suggested in his essay "Freud's Anthropomorphism," is not confined to animals: it is also the op- eration by which underlying processes in physics, and in the unconscious, are figured and explained (Nagel, Other Minds 1995). 5. Thanks to George Hart for reminding me of Evernden's attempt to rehabilitate the so-called "pathetic fallacy." See also Ruskin's original essay on the subject, reproduced in part in Coupe (26-31). 6. This introduces, of course, a huge linguistic debate on which I am scarcely qualified to comment; but one might mention the debate between Quine, with his notion of "the indeterminacy of translation" (see Quine 27) and Chomsky, who, by regarding the language ability as innate, biological, and unique to humans, both postulates limits to that indeterminacy and dis- qualifies animals from participation in language as such (Chomsky). I am grateful to David Ryan for direction here. 7. The famous example is of the "counting" horse, Clever Hans. It turned out he was picking up subliminal clues from his audience (Gould and Gould 1-2). Incidentally, it is not Flush who is counting the hours and times per week here; this is the interpolation of the omniscient narrator. 8. Some degree of anthropomorphizing is becoming less taboo even amongst scientists (Scholtmeijer 74). Frans de Waal warns, however: "It should not be our goal to find some quality in an animal that is precisely equivalent</page><page sequence="16">130 ISLE to an aspect of our own inner lives. Rather, we should use the fact that we are similar to animals to develop ideas we can test" (53). 9. A subject of some intensive recent research (especially Payne), an ex- tension of our own ideas of "language," with ongoing implications for el- ephant management in African game parks. That this should imply pro- foundly different classificatory systems is both unsurprising and a real chal- lenge to anthropomorphic fiction. After all, human societies classify things in ways utterly baffling to one another (see Mantovani 9-13). Recent experi- ments indicate that even pigeons attain a quite sophisticated degree of clas- sification (Gould and Gould 173-74). 10. This bears interesting comparison with the after-worldly "Timbuktu" of Paul Auster 's novel of that title. 11. It is worth stressing, however, that there is no "actual" behavior ob- servable: any observation, however "scientific," is necessarily refracted through some or other preconceptual filter or metaphor of perception. 12. It takes only a competent translator of observable behavior, it seems, to convert even the skeptic to such a "sentimental" appreciation, as for in- stance, Richard Leakey was converted literally overnight by Joyce Poole (see Leakey). 13. This is worth contrasting with Flush's spasm of "irrational" activity, rushing back to die on Barrett Browning's bed - a premonition that he doesn't recognize as one (Woolf 104-5). 14. Gowdy doesn't go quite as far as Adams in Watership Down , in which rabbits have a unique vocabulary (silflay for "eat," etc). Gowdy 's neologisms tend to be compounds ("flow stick" for snake), or descriptive epithets ("lu- natic" for wildebeest). REFERENCES Adams, Richard. Watership Down. New York: Prentice Hall, 1976.
