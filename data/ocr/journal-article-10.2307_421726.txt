<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Problem of Actor Designation in Political Analysis Frederick W. Frey One of the most important but least recognized aspects of political analysis can be called the problem of actor designation. Any political analysis, be it of a system, structure, process or relationship, collectivity or individual, focuses upon desig- nated actors as critical analytic components. Characters in political arenas must be distinguished and identified. Indeed, the most fundamental conceptions of the very term "political" implicitly or explicitly employ the actor notion in their key defi- nitions.' Nonetheless, despite the central analytic position of the, actor notion and actor designation, there has been little appreciation of their profound significance for political analysis and little attention paid to their problematic features. This essay presents a basic exploration of actor designation in political analysis. First, we shall explicate the conception of a political actor so that our core concern will be clear. Then we shall indicate the crucial significance of actor designation for most major areas of political analysis. Third, we shall suggest some essential criteria for fruitful actor designation. Finally, we shall consider several important residual problems that plague analysis. The Conception of a Political Actor Superficially, it is hardly surprising that the conception of politics and the process of political analysis should involve the notion of focal actors, both fundamentally and pervasively. One might say that politics is, after all, clearly about people and that the term "actor" may be merely another academicism for "person." However, matters are not quite so simple. Politics and political science are indubitably about people, but in rather special senses, not in the most common intuitive sense. Political science usually does not deal with people in either their individuality or their totality. For example, any analysis that attempted to deal individually with the 230 million people of the United States, the five million inhabitants of greater Philadelphia, or even the 600,000 employees of the U.S. Postal Service would founder in data. Comprehen- sive analysis of any sizable system is therefore compelled to focus upon collec- tivities (group actors) wherever feasible. And even when the analyst's focus is upon a single individual, it is not upon the totality of that individual's characteristics. Instead, the individual is regarded more as a persona, and attention is concentrated upon certain of its features, such as the office or structural position it occupies and the role it performs. Hence, from a political-scientific perspective, one cannot accurately regard an actor in politics as a person in the sense of ordinary language. 127</page><page sequence="2">Comparative Politics January 1985 Now if an actor is not merely a person, we then confront the question of how the notion should be understood. Although it is ubiquitous in political analysis, most writers have left it undefined, without explanation. There is, of course, something to be said for treating it as a primitive notion, that is, leaving it undefined because it is presumably either intuitively understood or externally defined. However, since the use of the term in political science differs from most common usages and is also frequently ambiguous, a definition or explication is probably helpful. What the actor notion refers to in a basic sense has been well indicated by David Easton, namely, the most general designation of a participant in political life. "The value of the term is that it leaves entirely open the specific nature of the roles." One can speak of whatever types of actors one finds meaningful.2 Such openness, however, in turn raises the issue of what actor types, if any, are analytically most or least useful. Easton's orientation prompts two further questions: what does it mean to partici- pate in political life, and what kinds of entities can do this? Unfortunately, after noting the utility of a generic conception of a political participant, Easton's discus- sion of actors ("members") is directed predominantly toward individuals. Marx and Bentley, on the other hand, to take two classic examples, respectively see classes and groups (i.e., collective actors rather than individuals) as the quintessential personae of politics. Each of these perspectives has some manifest merit while at the same time excluding or slighting the others. Hence, a more comprehensive actor conception seems required.3 Recently, Oran Young has envisioned "an actor in world politics ... as any organized entity that (1) is composed (at least indirectly) of human beings, (2) is not wholly subordinate to any other actor in the world system in effective terms, and (3) participates in power relations with other actors." Somewhat similarly, a recent dictionary of political analysis defines a political actor as "an individual or social group that affects the decision process within a political system." Other actor conceptions have been proposed, but these illustrate enough of the cardinal consid- erations to permit us to proceed.4 The conception of a political actor must accommodate entities ranging from an individual (usually performing a role or occupying a position) to the largest cohesive collectivity. Which, if any, subsets of actor-types within this range give the greatest analytic purchase in various types of political situations is, after certain gener- alizations which we shall attempt to make, a research question not to be prejudged in the very definition of an actor. The actor notion will normally refer to human beings as Young requires, but it need not be entirely restricted to them. The comparative analysis of power phe- nomena in infra-human species (e.g., insect societies, primate groups) can be most instructive for political scientist and ethologist alike. The common requirement of at least some autonomy, however, raises more complex issues. Autonomy is certainly necessary in a potential sense but not always in actuality. For some analytic purposes it seems useful to be able to say that, even though Trilby is completely controlled by Svengali, Trilby is still an actor as long as there is significant potential for separate action. (An actor in thrall is different from no actor at all, as Pope 128</page><page sequence="3">Frederick W. Frey might have said.) Otherwise, such concepts as domination, complete control, satel- lites, and puppets vanish. At other times, however, it will be analytically conve- nient to consider such a wholly controlled relationship as a single actor. The choice will depend primarily on the topic and level of analysis chosen. For example, an actor and its fully controlled satellite would usually be considered a single entity from the perspective of a more comprehensive system but as two actors if the focus were on their relationship alone. For these reasons, then, we shall define an actor as any sentient entity that acts, that behaves-a "doer" as the dictionary says.s Whenever we inquire "Who .. .?'" we request an actor designation. Since the "political" is here regarded as that analytic aspect of interaction involving the allocation and exercise of power, a political actor is therefore any sentient entity whose actions can affect or respond to the actions of other actors-any sentient entity that can participate in power relations, as numerous writers have observed. In analyses of human affairs, actors will be either individuals or collectivities that display sufficient behavioral cohesion to make it fruitful to regard them as unitary entities. The General Significance of Actor Designation As previously stated, actor designation is of primary importance for political analysis. That importance is displayed in many basic areas, some well known and others rarely appreciated. Without actor designation there is no political or other social inquiry, for such relations only obtain among actors. Neither normative political concern nor empirical investigation can get underway without at least a tentative designation of the actors involved, be it only "rulers" and "ruled" or some equally crude equivalent. Problems of political philosophy or empirical analysis cannot even be couched for an "undifferentiated blob," to use Gouldner's imagery.6 Actor designation has been central to the historic interests of political thought, though seldom perceived as a crucial problem. Dahl's question, "Who Governs?", is a recent repetition of a chronic query in political life, some popular answers to which are rather simplistically presented in the major 'archies and 'ocracies. Knowl- edge of who has power-that is, what types of actors-has long been thought helpful in predicting how that power will be employed. The central normative issue of "Who should rule?" similarly calls for and has received answers in terms of diverse actor conceptions. Ideas of representation also fundamentally depend upon and define particular actor identifications, as do "pluralism,"' "corporatism," and numerous other ideologic-analytic orientations.7 Our main concern, however, will not be with normative or clearly mixed consid- erations, but rather with primarily empirical analyses. Our essential contention is that actor designation involves a critical set of analytic decisions that go far toward shaping the nature and outcome of any political investigation. Moreover, this fact and its ramifications have scarcely been recognized (and then only narrowly), so that scant systematic and serious attention has been devoted to the matter, with 129</page><page sequence="4">Comparative Politics January 1985 profound consequences for analytic performance and the theory-building on which it rests. Choice of actor designations is one of the essential first steps in any empirical political analysis, along with selection of the types of power relations to be consid- ered, the issues or activities of concern, and the time period to be covered. Unless at least these are determined, preferably explicitly, empirical focus is impossible: the target of inquiry cannot be adequately identified.8 As we shall see, the variety of available actor designations is enormous, so that a highly selective and influential decision concerning which to adopt (or invent) must be made at the very outset of investigation.9 Ideally, this decision should be made quite consciously and regarded as tentative, its suitability a matter for critical perusal as one proceeds. In practice, however, this is seldom done; actor designa- tions are usually made perfunctorily and are rarely reconsidered. Furthermore, there has been little development even of the tools necessary for assessing the appropriateness of the actor designations chosen, compared to alternatives and relative to the goals of the analysis. The fact that basic actor designations sharply channel the consequent analysis has been remarked from time to time by political thinkers but not generally appre- ciated.'0 The most common occasion for concern with the problem has been analysts' dissatisfaction with the particular actor categorizations of certain previous writers. For instance, the felt deficiencies of the Marxist actor perception (critics might say, "Through a Class, Darkly") led to emphases on elites, ethnic and tribal groups, and so on, even to the extent that class then had to be rediscovered in various systems." The limitations of the traditional political-scientific stress on formal and legal actors piqued Bentley's and Truman's assertion of the paramountcy of interest groups in political life.12 Perhaps some of the possible overemphasis of the importance of multinational enterprises in world politics is explainable in terms of the same type of reaction to the long dominance of the narrow nation-state perspective. Lowi's urging that "looking at social movements rather than groups provides an entirely new slant on politics because it unavoidably focuses on the process of change rather than on processes of persistence" is illustrative of both the tendency to supplant one limited actor perspective with another and of the channelling ("slant") of other aspects of analysis by particular types of actor designations. Few of the critics of particular actor characterizations have gone on, however, to pursue systematically the broader topic of the general analytic significance of actor desig- nation. 13 Areas of Analytic Significance Actor conceptions underlie virtually the entire spectrum of political thought from ideas about basic levels of analysis to understandings of systems, structures, politi- cal change, fundamental concepts and hypotheses, and perceptions of situations and issues. We shall look briefly at each of these. 130</page><page sequence="5">Frederick W. Frey Levels Levels of analysis are frequently defined in terms of particular actor con- ceptions. The "micro-" and "macro-analytic" levels, for instance, are commonly distinguished by the former's focus on individual actors and the latter's on group actors or collectivities.'4 In this case, the aggregate level is plainly a rather rough residual category, possibly necessitated by the social scientific failure to establish an agreed hierarchy of analytic levels. Nonetheless, the available schemes (e.g., the individual, dyad, small group, organization, institution or community, and nation or society) are predicated on the conviction that significantly different actor types and relations appear at each level.15 Otherwise the level distinction is otiose. Sophisti- cated demarcation of levels requires that the new actors and relations supposedly distinguishing each level be explicitly indicated. To a considerable extent, what kinds of levels one distinguishes depends upon what kinds of actor designations one is prepared to make. Systems The conception and differentiation of political systems similarly depend upon actor designation. A system consists of a set of elements and a set of relations mapped onto these elements. If one adopts an "interactionist" approach, each ele- ment must be linked to at least some other elements in the system. If one adopts a "constructivist'" approach, the null relation is also permitted. The defining elements of political systems are actors while the defining relationships are whatever con- nection or process one regards as "political" (power, authority, conflict, force, policymaking, etc.). Thus, one cannot define and identify political systems in general or in particular without making some kind of basic actor designation. The types of designations employed shape the kinds of systems considered. A "world of nations" is quite different from a world of transnational movements, multinational enterprises, regions, cultural-ideological groupings, or all of the above.'6 A nation of classes is different from one of interest groups or vertical alliances. Under altered actor conceptions, different issues and problems surface, and different time frames are suggested. Diverse actor designations have thus been the basis for many distinctions among political systems. Modern political systems are said to have more "differentiated systemic power units" (that is, actors with clear responsibility for allocating power within the system) than do premodern systems.17 A "class society" is one in which classes are not merely present but are of "primary significance" to explanations of "large areas of social conduct.""18 Various corporatist systems have been typed not only in terms of the presence of corporatist alliances, but also according to which types of actors are included by those ruling coalitions."9 Although one can con- template a democracy without democrats, one cannot contemplate certain other types of systems without the key actors around which they presumably revolve. There is no Pharaonic system without the Pharaoh, no despotism without a despot, no charismatic system without a charismatic leader, no patriarchy without a pat- riarch. In fact, actor designation often seems to suggest the system type, as in presidential systems and city-manager systems. Less obviously, many current notions of political systems, though not explicitly defined in terms of key actors, plainly or subtly depend on particular types of actor 131</page><page sequence="6">Comparative Politics January 1985 designations. Well-known examples would be the roles of "aggressor," "defender," and "balancer" in balance-of-power systems; the "superpowers" or "bloc hege- mons" in polarized systems; and reciprocal pairs of actors in systems of checks and balances or countervailing power. Indeed, the idea that certain types of key actors set the tone for entire eras has often been proposed.20 Correspondingly, the absence rather than the presence of certain key actors has also been seen as having enormous system-defining importance. "Mass society," for instance, has been conceived in terms of the lack of intermediary groups and organizations, thus isolating individuals and making them susceptible to au- thoritarian mobilization. Lowi discerns the pluralist system fully populated by interest groups but lacking social movements to perturb the predominant static tendencies. Parkin sees the absence of a "mass political party based on the subordi- nate class" (that is, a mass working-class party) as explaining the failure of a "radical value system" to develop, with pervasive effects on the political system. At the level of small-group systems, Gibb observes that group performances often suffer over protracted periods from lack of critical roles ("role deprivation").2 All in all, many system conceptions and pathologies rest upon particular actor in- terpretations and can be no more convincing than those designations. Structures Our comprehension of political structures similarly depends on actor designation. Again, this is to be anticipated since structure is an analytic aspect of social systems, referring to the abstracted configuration or pattern found in the relationships prevailing among actors. The cardinal point, however, is that the structural patterns perceived in any given system can vary strikingly in accordance with alterations in actor designations. As Ossowski tells us, "By conceiving a social structure in terms of a particular scheme [of actor designations], we confer a particular aspect on the social structure."22 This idea can be illustrated by imagining two extreme interpretations of an urban power study. The original study, let us suppose, found that in each issue-area examined power tended to be oligarchically distributed-a few people had much power while most people had little or none. However, from one issue-area to another, different persons occupied the apexes of these power pyramids. Hence, the original analyst might assert that there was no single, dominant elite. A radical critic, however, might object, contending that the designation of par- ticular individuals as the actors in the system was unfortunate. Although the specific people at the top varied, the radical critic might see them all as essentially substitutable elements of the privileged class. None of them would question private property, the legitimacy of profit, or the established constitutional arrangements. Thus, using a different set of actor designations in analyzing the same political system, the critic would perceive a different structural pattern, indeed, a power elite. The central issue would then become the appropriateness of the conflicting actor designations, hopefully to be resolved by appeal to agreed criteria for actor designation. But those, as we have noted, remain largely undeveloped. Dynamics A similar argument applies to the significance of actor designation for the analysis of political change. Whether, how much, and what kinds of change one 132</page><page sequence="7">Frederick W. Frey perceives are very much affected by the types of actor designations one employs, especially how coarse or fine, broad or narrow, they are. In general, the coarser the actor designations used, the less change one perceives. Hence, if one concentrates on individuals in particular offices as focal actors, governmental instability in the Third Republic of France seems extremely high. But if one regards cabinet mem- bership in general rather than individual portfolios as the appropriate actor designa- tion, the system demonstrated surprising stability. The same coterie of persons tended to play musical chairs among the offices. The point can, of course, be illustrated by trans-Atlantic examples. From a Marxian class perspective, the American political system appears almost stagnant. From a Bentleyan interest group perspective, it is nearly kaleidoscopic. Dis- agreements about political dynamics often hinge on disagreements concerning actor designations. Moreover, sophisticated analysis of political dynamics, as we shall see, probably requires a multiple perspective on actor designations in order to understand the dimensions of change, but this approach is unexplored. Apart from the very perception of change, actor designations are also often fundamental to explanations of change or its absence (inertia). Thus, Marx sees actor formation as a crucial process leading to revolution in capitalist systems. The internal homogeneity and cohesiveness of the bourgeois and proletarian elements increase from the level of a "class-in-itself' to a "class-for-itself." "Once history has carried these tendencies . . . to their extremes [i.e., the two contending actors are fully formed], the point is reached at which the fabric of existing social structure breaks and a revolution terminates capitalist society."23 However, if one rejects these extremely comprehensive and controversial actor designations, the argument unravels. Another deservedly influential analysis of political dynamics is Samuel Hunting- ton's Political Order in Changing Societies. Huntington sees "political instability" as determined by the ratio of "political participation" to "political institutionaliza- tion." "Institutionalization" in turn refers to certain features of organizations and procedures. In our terms, Huntington regards political instability as produced by actor types, performance, and support that are inadequate to handle the increasing political pressures of transitional societies. Certain key actors are missing or cannot carry out necessary actions, while disruptive new actors are able to enter the political arena far too readily.24 In both analyses (Marx and Huntington), change and inertia are explained very much in terms of the presence or absence of critical types of actors. Once more, the explanations can be no more effective than the actor designations on which they rest. Concepts and Hypotheses Although it is not usually recognized, many fundamental concepts of political analysis depend upon critical actor designations, at least some of which are problematic. "Our whole notion of negotiation," according to Taylor, "is bound up for instance with the distinct identity and autonomy of the parties, with the willed nature of their relations; it is a very contractual notion. But other societies have no such conception [of clearly articulated, autonomous, contending 133</page><page sequence="8">Comparative Politics January 1985 actors]."25 Foreign policy has been defined as "those discrete official actions of the authoritative decision-makers of a nation's government, or their agents, which are intended by the decision-makers to influence the behavior of international actors external to their own polity."26 Public policy is commonly defined to be "what government does. . . . It is widely assumed that by definition public policy is government policy," a conception, Nadel feels, that "tends to trivialize political science."27 And the at least temporary eclipse of that elusive actor concept, the State, undermined an entire terminology of political analysis. Consequently, notions such as sovereignty and autonomy were transformed into ideal-typical limits rather than actual conditions, an altered conception of the legislature was produced, and interest declined in a popular vision of political science (as the study of the State).28 Since many political concepts rest upon the acceptability of particular types of actor designations, it is to be expected that many influential hypotheses also depend upon such designations. One of the most important of these, for example, can generically be called the "heterogeneity hypothesis." Suggested in various forms by many analysts, it essentially asserts that the more heterogeneous or diverse the actors in a political system, the more difficult and improbable is their concerted behavior.29 A variant of this thesis is that diversity of actors in a system engenders moderation, either through "cross-pressures" or countervailing power. In all such instances, however, the plausibility of these hypotheses depends fundamentally upon the kinds of actor designations employed. Inappropriate designations may suggest inconsequential diversity or mask genuine variation, leading in either case to misinterpretation. At a very general level, awareness of the problem of actor designation also prompts other hypotheses worthy of attention. For example, both Young and Coleman have fastened upon the analysis of political relationships according to similarities or differences of actor types, though neither carries the analysis very far. Young distinguishes relations between or among actors of the same type from those between or among actors of different types. Coleman emphasizes what the law calls "natural persons" and "juristic persons" and argues that "each type of person [actor] seems to give preferential treatment to its own kind."'3 The most refractory of all relations seem to be individual (natural) to corporate (juristic). One might want to entertain the even more general hypothesis that a highly dispropor- tionate incidence of political misperceptions and difficulties will occur in cross-type actor relations. All this depends once more, however, upon the use of effective actor designations and is totally frustrated by inappropriate ones. Perception and Cognition Perhaps the most immediately important effects of actor designation occur through its impact upon our perception and cognitive processing of political situations and events. "Identification precedes and determines percep- tion," says Alfred de Grazia, and "entitation is vastly more important than quanti- tation," declares the scientist Ralph Gerard.3' Even the crudest Gestalt of a politi- cal phenomenon implies some kind of actor designation-an initial identification of the entities involved. Those initial actor designations, essential to a first "definition of the situation," establish a rough theoretical mind-set, stimulating expectations 134</page><page sequence="9">Frederick W. Frey with prima facie priority and usually with profound impact. The original actor designation is probably the most basic theoretical placement-the fundamental image component-in the perception and interpretation of politics. In social psychology, the process to which we refer is frequently called "typifica- tion." Hewitt and Stokes explain it as follows. [T]he thematic organization of meaning by interactants usually depends upon their ability to interpret each others' actions as manifestations of particular identities .... In their relations with one another, people search for and make use of specific cues from others as a means of typifying them, i.e., of treating them as kinds of persons. Socialized individuals carry with them a vast store of information, as to how various types of persons will behave, what they are like, their typical motives and values, how to deal with them, etc. In concrete situations they search for cues from others, invoke a typification that appears relevant to those cues and rely upon the stores of informa- tion organized by the typification in their subsequent interaction with the other, filling in the "gaps" in the others' self-presentation with the typification.32 Hence, in one sense, much of our concern could have been described as an analysis of the significance of political typifications, especially those of political scientists. At the core of power relations, choices of whom and how to influence and when and how to react are partly based upon actor designations and the understandings they elicit. Actor designation is also deeply related to legitimacy and ideology. The images of proper power relations that are the basis for ideas of legitimacy and authority are conceived in terms of various types of actor designations. Only thus can they be readily taught to new members of the political system (socialization), and only thus can they hope to govern behavior in a host of superficially unique situations. The actor designations used in prevailing normative systems therefore have major practical import and warrant special analytic scrutiny. Lack of correspondence between such normative actor designations and those of empirical use leads to unusually large areas of alegitimacy with serious impairment of social control. As for ideology, one of its main functions is to provide people with preferred sets of actor designations and lead them to eschew other designations deemed "danger- ous.'33 Shaping the actor designations an observer employs is to go far toward determining his or her conclusions. These features of the actor designations used by publics and policymakers are, of course, grist for the theoretical mill. Theories of political perception and of actors' efforts to manipulate designations reflect the key cognitive role played by such images.34 However, one should not fail to apply the insight to theorists as well. Careful examination suggests that some of our most fundamental theoretical per- spectives are shaped by very cursory actor conceptions and rest upon questionable implicit typifications. An example is our continued use of the Aristotelian actor categories for polities-those ruled by one, by a few, or by many (monarchy/ dictatorship, aristocracy/oligarchy, and democracy/ochlocracy)-in our analyses of national systems. This procrustean reduction of a continuous distribution of cases (according to the distribution of power in the system) into but three gross actor 135</page><page sequence="10">Comparative Politics January 1985 types has led to pronounced exaggeration of the monolithic aspects of dictatorships and the egalitarian aspects of democracies. Most national political systems display varying degrees of oligarchy; the use of only three actor designations, two of them extreme cases, to handle such a distribution has led to the dubious forcing of designations with resultant misinterpretation of behavior.35 Another illustration of apparent perceptual bias arising from the actor typifica- tions of theorists involves the notion of a "superpower." Not infrequently, such a designation is casually extended from the military realm where it originated to economic and political areas where the expectations it creates seem largely mis- leading. Like the public and the policymaker, the theorist's actor designations and typifications can tacitly color his or her understandings. When colleagues share the same typifications, the separating of well-founded theoretical corollaries from mere in-group typification consensus may be difficult. Interests and Issues Finally, actor designations and issue perceptions are also strongly intertwined. Actor designation often determines issue identification, and vice versa. From the former perspective, the key process is that actor designation leads to the imputation of identity and interests which, in turn, leads to issue perception when there is a perceived interest blockage by other actors. Which interests and issues are conceived, articulated, and (possibly) aggregated depends heavily on the kinds of actors seen to man the political stage. For example, many analysts have suggested that political systems in which actors are conceived primarily in ethnic terms are more likely to exhibit major conflicts over cultural issues, whereas systems in which actors are conceived primarily in class terms are more likely to exhibit conflicts over economic issues.36 Previously discussed examples are also relevant in this connection. Coleman contends that "when the corporate actor comes into existence, a new set of interests comes into existence"-interests, moreover, that are not reducible to those of any of the corporation's components. Lowi has proposed a well-known classification of actors, issues, tactics, and other features of politics likely to be found together.37 And even the familiar political saw that "Where you stand de- pends on where you sit" is a recognition of the significance of actor designation for issue perception and posture. In that idiom, the present point is that "where you sit" is a matter of interpretation and perspective, not an obvious or automatic given. Some Criteria for Actor Designation Like other forms of conceptualization, actor designation is part of the art of science. It rests essentially on insight rather than reason, and the process of fruitful actor designation cannot be reduced to an algorithm or formula. The criteria that can be developed to promote effective actor designation are presently few, general, and similar to those established for other scientific conceptualization. Nevertheless, awareness of actor designation as a crucial form of social scientific conceptualiza- tion, rather than something simply given by "the real world" or conceptually trivial, 136</page><page sequence="11">Frederick W. Frey is a requisite for effective political inquiry. Actor designations are as much a part of the basic conceptualization of political science as more scrutinized notions like "revolution," "development," "coercion," or "interest."' Hence, attention to the limited criteria that can be suggested seems imperative. The few writers who have appreciated the problem have almost uniformly ex- pressed dismay at the cavalier way in which most analysts have proceeded. Dahrendorfs comments on sociology's efforts to grapple with the notion of class can be applied to the gamut of efforts at actor designation: Whoever examines the matter seriously "may well be tempted to regard... [political analysis] as rather a frivolous discipline."38 Greenstone formulated the central issue quite well when he asked, "by what warrant does the observer single out" any particular entities rather than others as the actors of focus. "After all," Baldwin adds, "we could distinguish between blonde and brunette political actors, but we do not."'39 Why? What guidelines, if any, can be provided for the analyst who wishes to do as well as possible in this area'? Theoretical Relevance Probably the most egregious weakness of actor designations in contemporary political analyses is their lack of theoretical relevance. As indi- cated, there has been little awareness that actor designation is as crucial a social scientific conceptualization as any other. Idiosyncratic, curbstone, journalistic, and unthinking actor designations are the rule and are a major reason why "our library shelves sag" under the weight of thousands of case studies that cumulate to little.40 Specific actor designations seem to be cadged from ordinary language or political participants, from the media or the law, and from prior analysts. Sometimes nor- mative considerations appear to generate actor designations that are then applied to empirical phenomena, often with meager regard for their appropriateness. "People," "democracy," "State," "ruler," "political man," "sovereign," and "political community" may be examples of originally normative notions forced into empirical applications for which inadequate conceptual foundations exist.4' Con- scious examination of the designations chosen is rare, let alone concern for their utility in developing empirical political theory. The predictable but often unadmitted result is vague, impressionistic analysis, lack of clear empirical referents, concern with extraneous problems and solutions, and general theoretical ineffectiveness.42 Two illustrations may help to protray the situation. -They are somewhat invidious selections from a plethora of possibilities. First, one might inspect any recent, popular textbook introduction to political science to ascertain the types of actor designations used. One finds that each such text contains literally thousands of different designations, ranging from unique individuals such as Jimmy Carter and Yasir Arafat to such collectivities as "modern nations," "world opinion," and "Muslims." A list of merely some of the designations from a very recent, com- prehensive, and relatively sophisticated text is presented in Table I, with the names of particular persons and organizations drastically pruned. Nary a justification for the designations chosen nor a moment's concern for their theoretical utility is expressed, though the text used is more theoretically oriented than many.43 137</page><page sequence="12">Comparative Politics January 1985 Table 1 A Selection of Actor Designations from an Introductory Textbook in Political Science third party voters students minorities workers citizen nation colonial subject imperial power leader Senator Congresman liberal conservative commnist American the British goverrment officials bureaucrat a anarchists rabble-rouser civil servant U.S.S.R. the machine Central Coomittee F.D.R. superpower presidint nuclear power charge d'affaires judicial activist filibusterer N.B.C. labor steel industry confidant J.F.K. bankers S..C.

Middle East France Kurds underclass intellectuals loyalist neutrals party LDC Attorney General Air Force A second illustration of the situation can be obtained by selecting nearly any respected political case study rather than a text to examine the actor designations employed. A knowledgeable study of political and social life in Spanish Harlem, for example, includes among others the following cast of actors: social workers, private landlords, speculators, big financial institutions, little guys, the underworld, the Cosa Nostra, reformers, Italian leaders, middle class white Protestants, top non- Anglo-Saxon leaders, white Protestant clergy, the old line Irish and Italian Catholic working class, top official leaders, Negroes, the people, Puerto Rican migrants, 138</page><page sequence="13">Frederick W. Frey white male professionals, Union Settlement, and white militants. Again, no explicit justification is provided for these designations, no alternatives are apparently con- sidered, and no serious concern is demonstrated for their use in the development of empirical theory-and this is reasonably regarded as a "fine" and "sensitive" study. What can be said about such a perplexing swarm of actors except that for theoretical purposes it is hardly many-splendored? Small wonder that comparability and explanation are so difficult. The ineluctable complexity of politics is even compounded. Such actor sets seem to oscillate between a proliferation of proper names and a patchwork of grandiose groupings such as "the public," "youth," and "the West." Moreover, we frequently seem to want to have our cake and eat it too by using designations that are simultaneously idiosyncratic and comprehensive like "the Europeans" and "Latin America."44 What can be done? On one hand, contrary to most present tendencies, we wish to make our actor designations as abstract and widely applicable as possible; thus we increase the power of our generalizations and the import of our studies. This strategy works, however, only as long as our designations are in some basic sense empirically warranted, that is, actually refer to entities manifesting unitary behavior of significance for our analytic purposes. Disregard that constraint, and overgener- alized designations either begin to produce unintentional science fiction or allow few valid and interesting hypotheses. On the other hand, the more common practice of sticking to the particulars and regarding each actor as unique is clearly a strategy of despair. We require at some stage in any theoretical analysis actor designations that are at least applicable across meaningful differences in time, issues, and systems, or else the comparison that is vital to scientific understanding becomes impossible. The problem confronting the analyst is therefore to ascertain the most general level of actor designation that permits accurate and substantively valuable theoretic propositions. It is obviously neither feasible nor necessary that every actor designation be global. Many useful designations will remain specific to particular system-types, such as monarchies, polarized systems, and market systems. Other things being equal, the broader the reference of an actor designation, the greater its utility. Actor designations whose applicability is limited to one particular system (not system- type), such as the United States from 1932 to 1946 or China in the Ming Dynasty, must be regarded as mere temporary expedients. Even if the designations are used only as vehicles for developing more general propositions not containing those actor designations (for example, a study of particular persons leading to the hypothesis that groups under stress tend to concentrate power), the designations ought not to be left idiosyncratic; if they are, replication becomes impossible or uncertain.45 Indeed, concern about the theoretical relevance of actor designations forces us to pay greater attention to indicating the boundaries of applicability of our hypotheses-a salutary effect. All in all, we require a constant press toward actor designations with as wide an applicability as possible across systems, issues, and time-an orientation that does not seem to have been highly salient to most analysts. A common problem in this respect is that in the early stages of investigation one 139</page><page sequence="14">Comparative Politics January 1985 frequently cannot know what the most effective level of designation will be. At this point the distinction among initial, intermediate, and ultimate actor designations is important. It is often necessary to commence an analysis at the level of idiosyncra- tic actor designations. What is essential is not to end there. It is the ultimate actor designation that must meet the criterion of theoretical relevance suggested. In an analysis of a legislative body (or a world of nations), for instance, one would probably begin by using idiosyncratic names as initial actor designations. One might map the structural characteristics of such a set of actors, their attitudinal profiles, their mobility patterns, and so on, at that level. But one should not leave it there. Later stages of the analysis must transcend the initial idiosyncratic designa- tions as far as possible and move to more theoretically useful designations in terms of structural positions, motivational characteristics, perceptual tendencies, and so forth.46 At the same time, we must note that the move from the idiosyncratic to the abstract is far from easy. The main constraint is loss of richness or accuracy. What can validly be said about the more generalized actor is often a severe drop-off from what can be said about the more particular actor. Conceiving of a more general categorization that does not sacrifice accuracy or information is undeniably difficult in many cases. Hierarchical articulations of various important actor types from particular to general (such as Count von X, Junker, and elite rural landholder) would be extremely helpful, permitting the more particular to be seen as instances of the more general; but such systematic actor schemata are virtually undeveloped. These deficiencies constitute some of the reasons why the ratio of political lit- erature to established political theory is so poor. The actor designations currently used by analysts are so numerous and varied that an exhaustive typology is difficult. Apart from the totally idiosyncratic desig- nations, however, the great majority fall into a limited set of categories: social background or demographic characteristics (age, occupation, ethnicity, population size), concrete group membership (Legionnaire, trade unionist, NATO ally), formal position (president, MP, host country), informal position (top leader, gatekeeper, victor, elite), resource control (plutocrat, the poor, affluent society), function (voter, opposition, socializing agent), and attitudinal or behavioral characteristics (liberal, appeaser, vested interest). Can any substantive criteria be suggested to winnow this unwieldy collection and improve future analyses? Although any of these designations may prove valuable in certain inquiries, two basic types of designations appear to offer the greatest analytic payoff. One is actor designation in terms of factors that maximally help predict that actor's political behavior in the realm of concern. For example, if we know that an actor is truly designated as a "conservative" or a "belligerent," we usually have an improved understanding of what to expect from it in relevant situations, especially if the actor designation employed is commensurate with one used in established psychological theory. Attitudinal or stylistic designations and those reflecting major structural constraints on the actor of reference most fre- quently seem to meet this criterion. The other most valuable type of designation is one that does not necessarily 140</page><page sequence="15">Frederick W. Frey strongly predict the behavior of the actor of reference but does help to predict the likely impact on others of the referent actor's behavior. If we know that the actor is a "head of state" or a "bloc hegemon," for example, we may not know what it will do, but we may be rather certain that virtually whatever it does in a certain realm will be highly significant for surrounding actors. Most formal and informal posi- tional designations display this characteristic. Incidentally, "blonde" and "brunette" actor designations are thus rejected on both grounds. They do not relate well either to the political behavior of the referent actor or to the likely impact on others, except in the area of "having fun," perhaps. Obviously, these suggestions are very general and thin. The development of more effective substantive guidelines for fruitful actor designation depends on research specifically directed to that end. It should not be a minor entry in our list of pressing projects. Cohesiveness The most basic distinction among actors is probably that between individuals and groups. "Exactly how individuals and social wholes are related to each other, and even how each unit can be conceptualized, is a persistent theme in both the origins and very nature of political discourse," according to Frohock.27 Certainly each of the two basic types has had its vehement partisans. Hannah Arendt, for example, declares that "power is never the property of an individual; it belongs to a group ... ." Dennis Wrong asserts that "groups, not individuals, are the major political actors ... ." Coleman contends that "it is the corporate actors ... that are the primary actors in the social structure of modern society." And Bentley, most aggressive of all, announces that "there are no political phenomena except group phenomena" and that "when the groups are adequately stated, ev- erything is stated."48 It is also often maintained that when individuals do seem to wield significant power they do so only in terms of some position they occupy in an important group. On the other side, we find James Wilson referring to individuals as "the irreduci- ble atoms of politics," proponents of decision-making approaches emphasizing that political choice boils down to decisions made by individuals, and A. A. Berle asserting that "power is invariably personal."'49 Any group behavior can ultimately be depicted via patterns of individual behaviors (though the significance of such an observation is easily misinterpreted). At the very least, it seems extremely doubtful that valid explanations of many important political phenomena can be formed without adducing the behavior of individual actors. Consider the development of the Polaris system, sans Rickover; the Nazi invasion of the U.S.S.R., ignoring Hitler; Watergate, without Nixon; or the Soviet purges, lacking Stalin. Societies without group actors have even been located. Fallers' work on nineteenth-century Buganda led him to conclude that the hierarchical power structure of that society" was an ordering of individuals rather than groups."50 A completely individualistic focus, however, is possible only in the analysis of limited relationships or very small systems. Our contention, as previously stated, is that political analysis requires actors ranging from individuals to the largest cohe- sive collectivities. There are, of course, problems with each basic type of actor 141</page><page sequence="16">Comparative Politics January 1985 designation, individual or group. The most worrisome problems, however, seem to center about group actors. Thus, Monsen and Cannon venture that "the term 'group' denotes one of the outstanding political uncertainties."5' Reification, mistaken anthropomorphic interpretations of collectivities, and exaggeration of human pro- pensities toward organization are among the many symptoms of the difficulty of group actor designation. For this reason, a thorough understanding of the nature and problems of group actor designation is essential. Two strongly related concerns seem to dwarf the rest. One is the conception of a group for purposes of defining a group actor, and the other, following from the first, is the matter of the kind'and degree of behavioral cohesion required among the components of a group actor. Collectivities, often called "groups," have generally been distinguished along two main dimensions: shared characteristics (interests, attitudes, resources, social background factors, stratificational positions, etc.) and organization or behavioral cohesion (acting in concert).52 The initial problem has been that of deciding upon the analytic roles to be given to these two types of features. A common confusion has been to assume that the first implies the second. Thus, for example, women, students, farmers, the rich or poor, and intellectuals have often been assumed to be cohesive, unitary political actors because they have a shared characteristic. Many political analyses have foundered upon this confu- sion, despite warnings by Marx, Bentley, and others. As David Truman has in- sisted, "even where a shared trait is the basis of the group (defines eligibility for membership) it is the interaction [among members] which is crucial ... not the shared characteristic."53 Shared characteristics do not necessarily imply behavioral coordination; potentials and probabilities at best are suggested and must be specifi- cally explored to justify the assertion of a true group actor. A group actor is a collectivity that, as Habermas has said, can successfully "be regarded as an individual."54 The paramount reason for using group rather than individual actors is parsimony. That parsimony, however, is more than merely an ordinary economy in political analysis. It is vital because without it we cannot even hope to fathom large-scale political systems. At the same time, the utility of employing group actors-that is, of treating sets of individual actors as if they were a single entity--depends totally upon such coordination of their relevant behaviors as to make the collectivity meaningfully interpretable as unitary. Otherwise, it is merely an aggregate. Neglect of this criterion is one of the cardinal faults of much analysis. The requirement that any group actors used in political investigation must display sufficient behavioral cohesion among members so as to produce unitary group actor behavior means that knowledge of the relevant behavior of some few group mem- bers (leaders, spokesmen, representatives, etc.) permits prediction of the behavior of the rest. Within the parameters of the analysis, the actor-elements of the political system examined must be sufficiently cohesive, "billiard-ball-like," "monadic," or irreducible so that their further analytic decomposition would not significantly improve the conclusions. Breaking up the group actors used into smaller compo- nents would only complicate the analysis without appreciably increasing its effec- 142</page><page sequence="17">Frederick W. Frey tiveness. This is only true if the group actors employed are unitary entities-behave as one-for the matters studied.55 Hence, undergeneralization of actors (seeing too many and too particular actors) confounds analysis and does not improve understanding, while overgeneralization (seeing too few and too comprehensive actors that are not unitary in their behavior) leads to distorted analysis and misinterpretation. Again, both are very widely exhibited. Countless case studies replete with quickly forgotten proper names illustrate the magnitude of the problem of undergeneralization, while many analyses of national systems in terms of a dozen or so actors of shared characteristics (the military, peasants, business, etc.) illustrate the chronic problem of overgeneraliza- tion. An important recent example is the tardiness with which western political leaders and scholarly specialists picked up the Sino-Soviet rift, which Robert Tucker attributes partly to the analysts' fixation on a presumed group actor vari- ously labeled "the communist camp," "international communism," or "the Soviet bloc."56 One can usefully distinguish a range of variation among collectivities in terms of their group actor potential. This range extends from totally random collections of individuals through "categories" and "quasi-groups" to true group actors, as indi- cated in Table 2.s7 Obviously, this is an arbitrary categorization of two continuous variables (sharing and cohesion).

Alliance. 143</page><page sequence="18">Comparative Politics January 1985 Even cursory inspection reveals that the distinctions of Table 2, important as they may be, are extremely gross, and this feature directs us toward the second problem mentioned, the problem of "cohesiveness." Few important group actors obtain perfect coordination among their members' behaviors all the time. When a veterans' organization endorses a policy, not all members support it; when the legislature takes a stand vis-a-vis the executive, some legislators usually fail to comply; and even when a parliamentary cabinet adopts a policy, some members may at least privately not live up to the full demands of cabinet responsibility. We do not wish to deny the group actor designation to such collectivities because of minor or insignificant deviations from perfect cohesion. Absolutely unitary action is a naively impractical criterion for a group actor. If one admits degrees of cohesion (behavioral coordination), however, that raises the thorny question of a cut-off criterion and its justification. How much slippage from perfect or complete cohesion is acceptable for retention of the group actor designation, and how much forces reanalysis of the putative group actor into some more numerous components? This problem is one of the true difficulties of political analysis, one that has not been well perceived or pursued, let alone answered.58 Some Basic Problems of Actor Designation Even if one realizes that actor designation is a crucial part of political conceptuali- zation, with all the implications thus far discussed, several basic problems still remain. One of these, soon encountered by the analyst, is the problem of agency. Although the term "agent" is ambiguous, we refer to its meaning as "one who acts for, or in the place of, another, by authority from him" or, at least, with mutual recognition and intent.59 Investigation reveals a sizable set of related agential roles (actor types) dif- ferentiated mainly by degrees of influence between control and agent, legitimacy, intention, and recognition. The inventory of terms used for different types of agents includes "minion," "proxy," "tool," "straw," "front," "deputy," "delegate," "steward," "representative," and "subsidiary," shading off in various directions. However, the essential problem of agency for actor designation is quite clear. Should the possible agent be designated as a distinct actor in its own right, in terms of its own characteristics, or is the actor better regarded as part of some other more inclusive actor which should instead be designated? If agency is overt and widely recognized, as with formal employees, ambassa- dors, and representatives, it poses few problems. One can usually apply one of the many agential designations available and/or group the agent with its control. Hidden agency, however, is a chronic and serious difficulty in actor designation and the crux of many persistent political arguments. Are the judges in international sports competitions, such as figure skating or diving, true judges (independent evaluators), or are they more accurately seen as agents of particular political systems? Are certain congressmen validly seen as relatively autonomous legislators, or are they more realistically viewed as agents for special interests such as cotton, oil, tobacco, 144</page><page sequence="19">Frederick W. Frey or the corporate clients of their law firms? Are multinational enterprises simply that, or are they more accurately seen as the tools of neocolonialist powers? Are antinuclear organizations Communist fronts? Conservative and radical, paranoid and naive analyses have clashed heatedly and repeatedly over these matters. An excellent illustration of the significance of the agency problem is supplied by the voluminous work on interlocking directorates.6o If individual actors are the analytic units in such research, the degree of interlock is usually reduced, compared to that displayed if individuals who are bankers are regarded as agents of a gener- alized "banking" actor, if lawyers are seen as agents of a legal-corporate entity, or if all such individuals are agents of the capitalist class, a ruling elite, etc. When two executives from the Bechtel Group sit in the cabinet, are they best regarded as merely two distinct cabinet officials, as actors from Bechtel, from multinational enterprise, or from "big business"? Such actor designation problems precipitated by the sometime fact of agency lie at the heart of much political disputation, both partisan and theoretical. How is an agent to be distinguished from an actor who is merely influenced by another actor? From some perspectives, an agent will usually be most fruitfully regarded as a component of a larger group actor-that is, included with its control. On the other hand, an actor who is merely influenced by another actor in some more limited and sporadic fashion is still a distinct actor in its own right and should not be grouped. The distinction between an agent and an ordinarily influenced actor involves the nature and degree of the linkage between an agent and its control. First, agency commonly implies some separation between agent and control. The agent is acting for the control in an arena that is usually outside the control's main locus of activities. Hence the need for an agent. It is this separation of agent and control, physical or topical, that engenders much of the uncertainty in designation when the fact of such agency is not overt. The agency is not normally expected; on the contrary, there is usually a bias toward distinct rather than agential designation for most ordinary actors. Second, within the established scope of the particular agency relationship the agent is usually more strongly and completely influenced by the control than is the case in most nonagential power relations. Relatively little of the agent's power and few of its resources in the area of its agency are likely to be its own; they tend to be derivative from the control. This is the key difference between an agent and a power broker. However, these are matters of degree, and the agency concept has not yet been sufficiently explicated in political analysis to permit its clear and consensual use in all relevant situations. A third, though far from decisive, consideration is substitutability. If numerous elements replace one another in what is thought to be an agential role and behave in much the same fashion, one gains confidence in the agency assertion, though exceptions are still possible. In particular, before turning toward an agency in- terpretation one must be careful to allow for general constraints affecting anyone in that position. Of course, one of the best indications of agency is discovery of an explicit or 145</page><page sequence="20">Comparative Politics January 1985 clear implicit agreement between control and agent or other evidence of such intent. Additional support may come from disclosure of instructions from the control followed by performance or attempted performance of the commanded behavior on the part of the agent. Access to such evidence is often extremely difficult, however, especially in those cases of hidden agency where uncertainty is greatest. Actor designation in possible agency situations is rendered even more difficult by the fact that actors may vacillate between agency and independence, or they may display an intricate mixture of concurrently agential and independent behaviors that is difficult to analyze. Thus Epstein cautions, in his study of The Corporation in American Politics, that "the fundamental issue in the question of what constitutes 'corporate' political activities is whether business political involvement should be viewed strictly in terms of the behavior of individual managers or whether it should be considered as an organizational activity intended to accomplish the political objectives of the firm." He finds it difficult to determine when managers are acting as individual actors and when they are acting as agents of their organizations.6' It is for reasons such as these that disputes over covert agency tend to be so rancorous and inconclusive. The problems are nonetheless of great importance and better ways of dealing with them are needed. Multiple Actor Designation Another grave problem of actor designation can be illustrated by asking various people to say, very casually, how they see the patterns of power in their community-what is the general picture? We are not interested in the correctness of their answers, for, in truth, we are presently unable to provide a very conclusive or expert response. Rather, we are interested in their perceptions, especially their actor designations. In most large American cities, if we reject proper names, the modal reply is often in terms of prominent formal political positions: the mayor, the council, the district attorney, party leaders, and so on. Others may opt for newspaper editors, bank presidents, lawyers, top executives, and the like. Fairly soon another respondent will disagree and maintain that a sophisticated view perceives an ethnic scene, with Italians, Irish, Poles, WASPs, Jews, Blacks, Chicanos, etc. Yet another will say that it is more an area-based interaction: Kensington, Shaker Heights, the North End, the East Side, Hyde Park, and other sections and neighborhoods. A respon- dent of more abstract bent will declare that this reduces to the center city versus the suburbs ("look at the mass transit problem"). Still others will shift the focus to social or economic classes, the "haves" and the "have nots," local versus exter- nally based interests, dominant and secondary occupations, or the "Old Guard" against the "Young Turks." An interesting thing about these perspectives, in addition to their diversity and omissions, is that each of them usually has some merit. Each usually offers some genuine insight into the political life of the community, at least in certain issue- areas. Nonetheless, each respondent commonly adopts one and only one perspec- tive in his or her ordinary thinking, insisting on its primacy and using it almost exclusively. Though respondents may occasionally vouchsafe some credit to other 146</page><page sequence="21">Frederick W. Frey views if pressed, especially on an abstract level, they essentially persist in their "one-dimensional" orientation. Such a single-minded rather than multiple perspective on the actors of politics seems to be a very common human characteristic. Butterworth observes that "of all forms of mental activity, the most difficult to induce even in the minds of the young ... is the art of handling the same bundle of data as before, but placing them in a new system of relations with one another by giving them a different framework, all of which virtually means putting on a different kind of thinking-cap for the moment." And Yarrow and Campbell's work shows" how rarely young children can attribute multiple or contradictory qualities to the same person. Most children characterize each other along only a single dimension."62 What is true for laymen, students, and children is unfortunately hardly less true for political analysts. Despite warnings, such as Bentley's admonition that "the varying sets of interests will not so settle or consolidate themselves upon masses of men as to make one classification adequate for all interests," political analysis has been characterized by a chronic tendency toward an obsessive limitation of focus to one type of actor.63 For Marx, this was class; for Bentley, neglecting his own advice, this was the interest group; for Mosca, the elite; for traditional political analysts, it was formal governments and parties; for international relations spe- cialists (particularly "realists"), it is the nation-state, and so forth. Each successive monotypic approach, though often useful in calling attention to the omissions of others, is nonetheless seriously distorted. State-centric, class- centric, group-centric, and similar perspectives, while making a limited contribu- tion, are as badly misleading if used alone as would be the use of only a top-, front-, or side-view plan for an architect's image of a building. The existence and deficiencies of the prevailing monotypic actor perspective are gradually being recognized. Attention to multinational and transnational actors in international relations, for example, challenges the state-centric view, though one hopes as an addition rather than as an alternative.64 Political analysts must develop a capacity for employing multiple actor designations, much as one employs multiple views of an object to gain a thorough understanding of it. Each perspective, each set of actor designations, often provides some distinctive insight. Thus, a commu- nity's political system might be examined using first a formal positional perspective, then a geographical-residential perspective, an ethnic perspective, an economic perspective, and so on through various interesting actor-types. Obviously, there are practical limits to the amount of analysis that can be done; but any analysis from only one actor perspective should probably be somewhat suspect; it is especially prone to bias, much as the use of only one camera to film an event produces a distorted interpretation. Summary The central point of this essay has been that actor designation, though largely taken for granted, is a crucial feature of political analysis. As such, it merits much deeper 147</page><page sequence="22">Comparative Politics January 1985 scrutiny than it has yet received. An initial task was to clarify the meaning of the concept "political actor." Following that, a general appreciation of the analytic significance of actor designation was offered, indicating the relevance of actor designations for levels of analysis, systems, structures, dynamics, concepts and hypotheses, perception and cognition, and interests and issues. Criteria for effective actor designation were then considered, concentrating particularly on theoretical relevance and the cohesiveness of group actor components. Above all, the neces- sity of recognizing that actor designation is as important a part of political concep- tualization as any other was stressed. Finally, some salient problems of actor designation were discussed, especially agency and multiple designation. All in all, many of the weaknesses of political analysis spring from ill-considered actor designation. Correction of these deficiencies and creative solution of out- standing problems will be far from easy, considering their embeddedness in estab- lished thought patterns. A necessary initial step, however, is a basic recognition of the problem and its dimensions.

Power, for instance, can be defined as a relationship among actors such that the behavior of one or more actors at least partly causes the behavior of one or more other actors. Decision-making is frequently defined as the choice-behavior of actors. Conflict exists when an actor perceives a blockage of his or her interests by another actor. Policy has been regarded as "a purposive course of action followed by an actor or set of actors in dealing with a problem or matter of concern." James E. Anderson, Public Policy-Making, sec. ed. (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1979), p. 3. Government can be defined as that actor in a social system with formal authority for allocating power for all actors in the system. The State is commonly perceived, after Weber, as that actor possessing a monopoly of the legitimate exercise of force over other actors in a given territory. And the "political system," according to Easton, is that analytic aspect of a society involving the authoritative allocation of values among its members (actors). David Easton, The Political System (New York: Knopf, 1953), pp. 128 ff. 2. Ibid., p. 57. Most authors refer to what we have called "the actor notion" by the term "actor," but some use other terms for the same idea, for example "member," "participant," "entity," "party," "element," and "component." 3. Kenneth Westhues, in "Class and Organization as Paradigms in Social Science," American Sociologist, 11 (1976), 38-49, sees these three basic actor orientations (individual, group or organization, and class) as the pedestals for the three dominant paradigms in sociology. 4.

It is in this sense that the completely controlled puppet is still a political actor. The actor conception must include the influences as well as the influencer in power relations. 6. Alvin W.

(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1961). In one sense, our concern is how to conceive of "who" in discovering "who governs." The fundamental question in representation is who is to be represented, along with its concomitants, how, why, etc. The answers are usually legitimized to create and perpetuate a system of culturally designated political actors. Samuel Beer, for instance, in British Politics in the Collectivist Age (New York: Vintage Press, 1969), p. xiii, observes that each of the five theories of representation he considers "defines a more or less coherent system of roles for political formations and their members." "Pluralism" is basically oriented to interest groups as actors;" "corpor- atism" is primarily oriented to vertical "alliances" of governmental and nongovernmental components. 148</page><page sequence="23">Frederick W.

"'The Limits of Exchange Theory," in Brian Barry, ed., Power and Political Theory (London: Wiley, 1976), p. 5. 15. For example, the small group differs from the individual and the dyad in that multi-individual alliances and coalitions are possible along with indirect relations, as Georg Simmel so well noted. The Sociology of Georg Simmel (New York: Free Press Paperbacks, 1964). The organization differs from the small group in that impersonal roles and highly indirect relations are present. Furthermore, "as we begin to move from the small group level to the societal level of analysis, social units emerge which specialize in the exercise of power in the name of the system as a whole." Edwin W. Lehman, "Toward a Macro-Sociology of Power," American Sociological Review, 34 (1969), 460. One of the most interesting attempts at more systematic conceptualization of analytic levels is proffered by Galtung, pp. 37-45. 16. Among many works stressing this point, see Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, Power and Interdepen- dence (Boston: Little, Brown, 1977); Richard Mansbach et al., Nonstate Actors in the Global Political System (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1975); Ronald Yalem, "Transnational Politics versus International Politics," Yearbook of World Affairs, 1978 (London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1978), pp. 237-250; and John Herz, 149</page><page sequence="24">Comparative Politics January 1985 Internationa l Politics in the Atomic Age (New York: Columbia University Press, 1959).

Examples include the church in the medieval world, the corporation in industrial society, and, supposedly, the institutions of knowledge in postindustrial society. The development of the capitalist system has been viewed as permitted only through the emergence of a new type of actor, the trust, and its successor, the corporation. In the same vein, some argue that the invention of the State led to man's momentous domestication of man. The appearance of modern nations has been hardly less important. And, of course, many have seen political parties as actors essential for representative democracy. Indeed, the invention of certain new social actors has been claimed to equal in importance the life-transforming discoveries of fire, the wheel, engines, computers, and other marvels of human ingenuity. 21.

As another example, Galtung defines integration as "the process whereby two or more actors form a new actor." Johan Galtung, "A Structural Theory of Integration," Journal of Peace Research, 5 (1968), 377. That conception, however, is more appropriately regarded as the upper bound to the integrative process. 26. Charles Hermann, "Policy Classificiation: A Key to the Study of Foreign Policy," in Rosenau, ed., The Analysis of International Politics, p. 72. Hitching the concept of foreign policy to national officials precludes its application to the intended external uses of power by other systems, such as U.N. organi- zations and multinational enterprises. A broader, more theoretical definition might enhance comparative inquiry. 27. Mark V.

Thus, Clark maintains that "the greater the internal differentiation of a sector, the less the activation of its members' resources," and Wilson notes that "it is frequently asserted that large organizations with diverse memberships are less likely to take positions on controversial issues than are small associations with homogeneous memberships .. ."

Legitimacy refers to correspondence between one's ideas of proper power relations-what they ought and ought not to be--and one's observations of actual relations. Relations and associated features that conform to one's normative notions are "legitimate;" those that are repugnant are "illegitimate;" and those for which normative notions have not been developed constitute the important class of "alegitimate" relations. 34.

The three pairs of classifications given are intended to reflect Aristotle's distinction of pure and corrupt manifestations of each type. He spoke of tyranny or depotism rather than dictatorship and saw timocracy as the pure form and democracy rather than ochlocracy as the corrupt form of rule by many, but the labels used seem more appropriate in modern discourse. Aristotle, of course, was continuing a tradition established by Herodotus and maintained by Plato. Moreover, he was too astute to be fully victimized by his own typology and frequently referred to "mixed" systems. For further insight into this problem, especially the notion of "pluralism," see Andrew S. McFarland, Power and Leadership in Pluralist Systems (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1969), and Jerry F.

Similjarly, Suzanne Berger has pointed out that "in France, opposition to the economic policies of the government has been organized by left-wing parties whose doctrines focus on class, not on region. ....

Most of the literature on case studies notes the idiosyncratic trap into which they regularly tumble, but none of it perceives actor designation as a key contributor to that problem. The quoted phrase is from Robert A. Dahl, "Business and Politics," in Robert A. Dahl, Mason Haire, and Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Social Science Research on Business: Product and Potential (New York: Columbia University Press, 1959), p. 36. 41. Each of the terms mentioned raises very serious conceptual difficulties in empirical use. The relation between normative and empirical analysis (assuming one grants the distinction) is important and relatively neglected. An interesting exception is Alvin I. Goldman, "Epistemics: The Regulative Theory of Cogni- tion," Journal of Philosophy, 75 (1978), 509-524. 42. Even research on "participation" and voting behavior, a relatively sophisticated area, reflects this problem in its explanatory hypotheses that use actor designations such as Catholic, rural, Democrat, and Black, whose meanings are likely to be inconstant and system-specific. 43. It seems unnecessary and invidious to cite the two examples used. The contention can be verified through any introductory text and most case studies. 44. The point that names of particular nations or political systems are idiosyncratic rather than theoretical notions has been made by Adam Przeworski and Henry Teune, The Logic of Comparative Inquiry (New York: Wiley, 1970), pp. 26-30. 45. We use the term "idiosyncratic" to refer to actor designations with only unique applicability (one time, one system, no possible recurrence). There is only one Jack Kennedy, the person, not the name, and only one Italy as of 1984. Idiosyncratic designations include but are not limited to proper names. The generality of actor designations is a continuum running from idiosyncratic to global. 46. One would like to have relatively objective, empirical procedures for actor designation, letting the data and accepted theory determine the designations as much as possible. Identifying structural positions through structural analysis at first glance seems to offer such an opportunity. There may be a rather awkward problem, however, if the initial actor designations necessary even to start the structural analysis bias the findings on which the ultimate designations are based. Hence, although one sympathizes with Berkowitz' desire to get away from designations that are "simply received or assumed," such objectivity is likely to be an ideal that can be approached but not totally realized.

In the explanations envisioned they would have to be more theoretically designated. The quotation on Fallers' work is from Robert A. LeVine, "Political Socialization and Culture Change," in Clifford Geertz, ed., Old Societies and New States (New York: The Free Press, 1963), p. 291. See Lloyd A.

Although the complete absence of significant group actors even in as small a society as that of the Buganda seems dubious, the great significance of individual actors does not. 51. Joseph R. Monsen, Jr. and Mark W. Cannon, eds., Makers of Public Policy: American Power Groups and Their Ideologies (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965), p. 5. 52. These dimensions are analogous to the two bases used in network analysis for discerning substructur- ing within social systems: similarity of structural locations (shared characteristics) and actual linkage (behavioral cohesion). See, Ronald S. Burt, "Applied Network Analysis: An Overview," Connections, 1 (1978), 9; Richard C.

Thus, the problem with the "billiard ball" model and the "monadic lock-in" is not their focus on actors regarded as unitary, as sometimes thought. On the contrary, the problems are: (1) that actors have been overgeneralized, regarded as unitary "billiard balls" or "monads" when they are not, and (2) that a single rather than multiple set of actor designations has been employed (e.g., only nation-states). Coherent, unitary actors are analytically essential, but they must meet the cohesiveness criteria established for such actors. Multiple actor designation will be discussed below. 56. Robert C. Tucker, "Culture, Political Culture, and Communist Society," Political Science Quarterly, 88 (1973), 189, and "Communist Revolutions, National Cultures, and the Divided Nations," Studies in Comparative Communism, 7 (1974), 239-240. We have supplied the labels used. 57. For many of these distinctions, see Morris Ginsberg, Sociology (London: Butterworth, 1953), p. 40; Dahrendorf, pp. 179-189; Robert Merton, Social Theory and Social Structure (Glencoe: The Free Press, 1949), p. 299; Wrong, pp. 146-149; and Nicos Poulantzas, Political Power and Social Classes, (London: Verso Editions, 1978), pp. 57-117. 58. The problem of determining a suitable cohesiveness cut-off criterion for group actor designation is similar to that of empirically determining system boundaries under an interactionist conception of systems, i.e., how much interdependence among elements should be required? Another way of formulating the problem is to ask how robust are the conclusions of an analysis in the face of deviations from the assumptions of perfect cohesiveness implied by the group actor designations used. Methods used elsewhere (e.g., statistics) for determining robustness may also be applicable in this case. 59. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (Springfield: Merriam, 1949), p 17. 60.

George proposes analyzing the foreign policy system from three actor perspectives: individual actors, small groups, and organizations. 152</page></plain_text>
